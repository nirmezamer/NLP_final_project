They allege that the poll was rigged in favour of the ANC and DA, but have not provided any evidence to back up this claim.\n\nIf and when MK takes up its seats, the party is likely to form an alliance with another radical party - Julius Malema’s Economic Freedom Fighter's (EFF) - to give the new coalition government a tough time.\n\nExpect them to revive demands that impeachment proceedings be instituted against President Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nIt emerged in 2022 that Ramaphosa stashed at least $580,000 (£458,000) in a sofa on his game farm. That money was later stolen by robbers.\n\nA panel of legal experts appointed by parliament recommended that impeachment proceedings be instituted against Ramaphosa, but the ANC used its then-parliamentary majority to block this.\n\nIn the build up to the 29 May election, Zuma made the scandal a major issue as he campaigned for votes - and MK and the EFF are likely to demand a full-scale parliamentary investigation.\n\nWill the DA - which fought corruption from the opposition benches - join them or will it help the ANC in shielding Ramaphosa?",

        "Israel announces military pause on Gaza road to let in aid\n\n5 hours ago By Kathryn Armstrong , BBC News Share\n\nAnadolu Israel is under pressure from its allies to enable sufficient aid to reach those living in Gaza\n\nThe Israeli military says it will hold a daily \"tactical pause of military activity\" along a road in southern Gaza to enable more humanitarian aid to enter, but emphasised that there is no ceasefire and combat would continue in Rafah. The pauses, which are said to have begun on Saturday, will last from 08:00 local time (05:00 GMT) until 19:00 local time until further notice. They will only affect a route that leads northwards from the key Kerem Shalom crossing, which Gaza shares with Israel. Aid agency ActionAid told the BBC it was getting a \"confused\" picture over what the pauses mean. Israel has been under continuous pressure from its allies, including the US, to prevent the humanitarian crisis in Gaza from worsening.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Sunday's announcement follows \"additional related discussions with the UN and international organizations\". The route of the humanitarian pause leads from the Kerem Shalom crossing in the south of Gaza to the Salah al-Din Road - a main highway - and then northwards to the European Hospital near the city of Khan Younis. In a post on X, the IDF clarified that there is no ceasefire in the southern Gaza Strip, and fighting would continue in Rafah. A spokesman for ActionAid, which is helping to deliver supplies in Gaza, told the BBC that the pause would help aid getting in but that they needed more details about logistics. \"We're still getting confused pictures around what these tactical pauses mean, how it will enable aid, not only to get inside the Gaza Strip, but to be distributed safely to the civilians there who need it,\" Ziad Issa said. He added that ActionAid had seen \"significant attacks on aid convoys that are trying to get from to Gaza from Kerem Shalom in the last few weeks\". A spokesperson for the United Nations' humanitarian office (OCHA) told the AFP news agency that the organisation welcomed the announcement. \"We hope this leads to further concrete measures by Israel to address longstanding issues preventing a meaningful humanitarian response in Gaza,\" said Jens Laerke.\n\nAccording to Israeli media, neither Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor the defence minister Yoav Gallant were aware of plans for a pause before they were announced. Mr Netanyahu's office reportedly said the prime minister had told his military secretary that the plan was \"unacceptable\" after hearing about it on Sunday. He has also reportedly been told that there has been no change to the IDF's policy and that the fighting in Rafah \"continues as planned\". Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said the decision to pause fighting had been made by a \"fool\" who was \"evil\". Hundreds of thousands of people have fled Rafah since Israeli troops entered it more than a month ago, seizing control of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing with Egypt and ordering many people to evacuate. The crossing - once the main point of entry for aid - has been closed since then. Israel says its operation in Rafah is necessary to oust Hamas from what it calls the group's “last major stronghold”. International agencies have warned of a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and made repeated calls for more aid to be let in. On Wednesday, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said a significant proportion of Gaza's population was facing \"catastrophic hunger and famine-like conditions\". The number of aid trucks entering Gaza continues to be well below what agencies have said is required. OCHA reported that in May, the daily average number of trucks delivering humanitarian aid into Gaza - excluding fuel - was 97. In April that figure was 169 and in March it was 139. Prior to the outbreak of the war on 7 October, around 500 trucks carrying aid - including fuel - were entering Gaza every day. OCHA points out that since 7 May, it has been unable to directly observe the arrival of aid from the private sector through the Kerem Shalom crossing.",

        "How a Kenyan farmer became a champion of climate change denial\n\n15 hours ago By Marco Silva , @BBCMarcoSilva, Climate disinformation reporter Share\n\nX/JusperMachogu\n\nClimate change deniers have found a new champion in Kenyan farmer Jusper Machogu. On social media, he has become known as a flagbearer for fossil fuels in Africa, but there is more to his campaign than meets the eye. At first glance, the 29-year-old Mr Machogu is just a young farmer with a knack for social media. On X, formerly Twitter, he regularly posts videos of himself weeding his land, planting garlic, or picking avocados - offering viewers a window into life in rural Kisii, south-west Kenya. While farming content may get him clicks, likes, and retweets, it is Mr Machogu’s denial of man-made climate change that has helped supercharge his online profile. Since he began posting debunked theories about climate change, he has received thousands of dollars in donations – some of which came from individuals in Western countries linked to fossil-fuel interests. Mr Machogu insists this has not influenced his views, saying they are genuinely held.\n\nScientists have proven that the Earth is heating up because of greenhouse gases that are emitted into the atmosphere when we burn fossil fuels - like oil, gas, or coal. But Mr Machogu disagrees. “Climate change is mostly natural. A warmer climate is good for life,” Mr Machogu wrongly claimed in a tweet posted in February, along with the hashtag #ClimateScam (which he has used hundreds of times). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says Africa is “one of the lowest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change”. However, it is also “one of the most vulnerable continents” to climate change and its effects - including more intense and frequent heatwaves, prolonged droughts, and devastating floods. Despite all this, Mr Machogu continues to insist “there is no climate crisis”. On social media, he has repeatedly posted unfounded claims that man-made climate change is not only a “scam” or a “hoax”, but also a ploy by Western nations to “keep Africa poor”. “[His views] are definitely coming up from a place of lack of understanding,” says Joyce Kimutai, a climate scientist from Kenya who has contributed to IPCC reports.\n\nDr Joyce Kimutai Joyce Kimutai says Mr Machogu’s views are not shared by many Kenyans\n\n“This is not religion, this is not just belief. It's about analysing the data and seeing changes in the data. “Saying that climate [change] is a hoax is just really not true,” Dr Kimutai added. Mr Machogu began tweeting false and misleading claims about climate change in late 2021, after carrying out his “own research” into the topic. Since then, he has launched his own campaign - which he dubbed “Fossil Fuels for Africa” - arguing that the continent should be tapping into its vast reserves of oil, gas, and coal. “We need fossil fuels to develop our Africa,” Mr Machogu tweeted last year. This view appears to be shared by some African governments, who have given their go-ahead to new oil and gas projects despite pledging to \"transition away\" from fossil fuels. Leaders like Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni have argued that it is hypocritical for Western nations to impose restrictions on African states, when they have become rich from fossil fuels. But climate activists like 24-year-old Nicholas Omonuk, from Uganda, point out that fossil fuel exploration has not always been a synonym for growth and development in Africa. “In [Nigeria’s] Niger Delta, there’s been oil extraction since the 1900s, but people there are still poor and are still suffering from health risks and from pollution,” he said.\n\nGetty Images Crude oil pollution has affected fishing and farming communities in Nigeria's Niger Delta\n\nAnd yet, Mr Machogu believes he has found a willing audience for his message - he has more than 25,000 followers on X. “I think Africans are really embracing the fact that I'm saying: ‘Fossil fuels for Africa’,” he told the BBC. But by tracking conversations involving Mr Machogu’s X handle, BBC Verify found that most users engaging with his account are actually based in the US, the UK, and Canada. Many of those users also promote conspiracy theories online - not just about climate change, but also about vaccines, Covid-19, or the war in Ukraine. However niche its views may be, this online community has thrown its support behind Mr Machogu and helped him fund his campaign. “Through saying whatever I say, I have seen my follower count going up and I've got people reaching out to me saying: how can we help you?,” he said.\n\nOn X, Mr Machogu has accused climate activists of alarmism\n\nBBC Verify looked at fundraising pages set up by Mr Machogu and found that, in the last two years, he has raised more than $9,000 (£7,000) from donations. Mr Machogu has posted online about using some of these funds to furnish his new home. But he also claims to have used donations to help dozens of local families by building a borehole for water, distributing gas bottles for cooking, or connecting their homes to the electricity grid. Among his donors were individuals with links to the fossil fuel industry and to groups known for promoting climate change denial. But Mr Machogu rejects suggestions that those donations have had any impact on his opinions on climate change. “Nobody has told me to change my views,” Mr Machogu insists. “I don’t have a problem with making money while saying what I believe I should say or doing what’s good for my community.”\n\nBy sharing his views online, he has undoubtedly caught the eye of many in the West who share his stance on fossil-fuel exploration and climate change. Canadian author Jordan Peterson retweeted one of his posts about fossil fuels, describing him as an “actual African”, in contrast with what Mr Peterson called the “poor, oppressed, useless African” supposedly imagined by “globalist utopians\". A US fossil fuel advocate paid for Mr Machogu to travel to South Africa for a conference promoting African oil and gas late last year. And, just months before, a film crew from the UK travelled to Kisii to interview him for a new documentary that described climate change as an “eccentric environmental scare”.\n\nTo some, Mr Machogu’s new-found popularity has not come as a surprise. “There’s been a real explosion in fossil fuel development projects in Africa,” says Amy Westervelt, a US investigative climate reporter who covers attempts to obstruct climate policy. “And because a lot of countries are passing policies that are limiting fossil fuels, Africa is also seen as a big market. “So, it’s very helpful to have people in Africa saying: ‘We want these projects’.” That is certainly a point Mr Machogu has made - again and again - on social media. But Dr Kimutai says his promotion of fossil fuels, along with his denial of man-made climate change, could have consequences. “Because we still have low climate literacy levels in Africa and in Kenya, and if that conspiracy theory spreads to communities or to people, it could just really undermine climate action. “That is really, really dangerous.”",
        "Boy grapples with tradition in Spanish bullfighting town\n\n13 hours ago By Steven McIntosh , Entertainment reporter Share\n\nAconite Productions Borja comes from an underprivileged background and is encouraged to pursue bullfighting by his grandfather\n\nA new documentary follows a boy living in a small town in Spain, whose family expects him to become a professional bullfighter. It may sound like an unusual career choice in an era where bullfighting is considered a cruel and outdated sport, primarily due to issues of animal welfare. Social attitudes in some parts of Castellón, however, are not quite as progressive as those in nearby Valencia and Barcelona, and the boy's grandfather, unbothered by the controversy surrounding bullfighting, encourages his grandson to pursue it. A new documentary, The Boy and the Suit of Lights, which has just premiered at the Sheffield Documentary Festival, follows the child, Borja, and the relationship with his grandfather, Matias, over several years. Director Inma De Reyes, who is from Castellón, grew up with the bullring in the centre of her hometown and saw coverage of bullfights on television, but didn't realise her birthplace was considered Spain's bullfighting capital. \"It's a small city where time hasn't passed, people have very traditional jobs, they work in fishing, the orange fields, or bullfighting, and every so often there would be a traditional celebration which is religious. \"So I see my hometown as where nothing ever changes. That's why I left, I didn't fit in there, I wanted to explore the world and find out who I was outside of that place. \"And by coming back and making a film there, that's how I started to look more in depth at how families are putting values onto children and the children's personalities are being shaped.\" When de Reyes began looking into the subject for a documentary, her mother sent her local newspaper articles highlighting the bullfighting traditions, and the film-maker was opened up to a world she \"hadn't taken an interest\" in previously. \"My granddad owned books and posters about bullfighting, but I did think that was generations ago,\" de Reyes recalls. \"I didn't know how big the culture was.\" A friend of the Spanish director, who is now based in Edinburgh, connected her to a bullfighting school, through which she ultimately met Borja.\n\nDirector Inma de Reyes was unaware of her hometown's reputation as Spain's bullfighting capital\n\nThe practice sees the bullfighter, usually in bright and decorated clothing, attempt to subdue, immobilise, or kill a bull, in a ring in front of a live audience. It's clear from the film that Matias harbours his own unfulfilled dreams of becoming a professional bullfighter, and pins his ambitions on his grandson succeeding where he failed, partly in the hope it might help lift the family out of poverty. Coming from underprivileged background, Borja feels limited by a life with seemingly little opportunity, and goes along with his family's wishes to begin with. Producer Aimara Reques says becoming a bullfighter is \"a romantic idea\", adding: \"That's what Borja is holding on to.\" \"Everybody sees the bullfighter as a figure with status, you don't think of the killing. As a child, he's fantasising just as the family does. 'Oh, wow, he's going to be standing up there'. \"It's a theatrical event, it's quite camp in a sense, you dress up, the mothers are so proud. But then you have to kill the bull, that's the biggest paradox.\"\n\nAn industry in 'decay'\n\nFilmed over five years, The Boy and the Suit of Lights doesn't shy away from the controversy surrounding bullfighting. Borja watches as protestors storm the ring during one fight with banners which say \"No violence.\" However, for a film with bullfighting at its centre - it contains noticeably little bullfighting footage. Instead, it's the backdrop of a subtle coming-of-age story about adolescence, family and poverty. \"We knew that the film couldn't have bullfighting at the front,\" says de Reyes. \"Borja's coming-of-age story had to be front and centre, and also to make the film watchable. \"You can watch bullfighting on YouTube, I was not interested in capturing any more of that. It's more about forming a personality as a child.\" On a practical level, there also wasn't a huge number of bullfights taking place - only two took place as the documentary was shooting.\n\nAconite Productions The boys practice using a replica bull's head mounted on a wheel\n\nDe Reyes, who is now based in Edinburgh, describes Borja's personality as \"gentle and caring\" - a temprement possibly unsuited to the bullfighting world. \"At the beginning, I was very impressed by Borja's dedication and he was so diligent about his duty. He was almost like, 'this is what I've been told to do and this is what I'm going to do'. I thought he was an amazing child,\" says de Reyes. \"And as time goes by, I hope you can see in the film how his mind doesn't fully engage with the commitment of killing a bull. And I also felt that as a director, that Borja wasn't made for this, and he kind of knew it.\" The film includes footage of Borja and his brother rehearsing using replica bulls' heads mounted on wheeled frames, with their grandfather looking on. It also follows Borja in other settings - spending time with his friends and getting a traditional bullfighter's costume fitted. However, the challenge of putting Borja's own story front and centre was that, like many boys his age, he wasn't always prone to sharing his feelings. \"Making the film, I was trying to capture what Borja was thinking without him saying it,\" says de Reyes, \"because I don't feel like he would ever say to anybody that he wasn't going to do this - but you could tell. \"So trying to capture that in cinema, saying he's starting to have these thoughts, without any voiceovers or interviews, was really hard.\" She credits her cinematographer with capturing Borja's emotions via facial expressions and body language. \"You start to realise he's got a lot going on, just by looking at him.\"\n\nGetty Images Barcelona's last bullfights were held in 2011 (pictured) after the Catalan regional Parliament voted to ban bullfighting",
        "Jordan Bardella could soon be French PM at 28. But for many he remains an enigma\n\n15 hours ago By Hugh Schofield , France Correspondent Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe French would dearly love to know who is the real Jordan Bardella. The question was interesting when Mr Bardella was merely president of the country’s biggest party, the far-right National Rally (RN). Now that he is being openly spoken of as the country’s next prime minister, it has become a matter of urgency. In two weeks the country goes to the polls in a snap election called by President Emmanuel Macron following his humiliation by the RN at the European elections last Sunday. If the RN has pulled off another big win after the second round of voting on July 7, then Macron will have no choice but to offer it a chance to govern. And if that happens, Mr Bardella – who shares the party leadership with Marine Le Pen – is expected to be named as prime minister. The French all know the basics about Mr Bardella, and his lightning rise from jobless school-leaver in the northern Paris suburbs to Le Pen protégé and president of the party. They know that he is ridiculously young, just 28, but that this seems to matter less nowadays, when experience no longer counts for much. The current president is just 46, and the prime minister 35. They know he is perpetually neat, that he speaks well, is ultra-presentable. But what he thinks, where he stands ideologically, what kind of person he is – these are unknowns. The French have the distinct feeling that the man they see is a package. Nicely-wrapped, but the contents are a mystery.\n\nJordan Bardella's potential was quickly spotted by Marine Le Pen\n\nThe official version of Mr Bardella – the one on the label – is a young man who grew up in a deprived estate in Seine-Saint-Denis and after living with the scourge of drugs, poverty, lawlessness and uncontrolled immigration came to believe that only the hard-right had the answer. This is “le story-telling”, a French borrowing from the world of marketing. As he himself has said: “I am in politics because of everything I lived through there. To stop that becoming the norm for the whole of France. Because what happens there is not normal.” The truth is more nuanced. Mr Bardella was indeed brought up by his single mother, Luisa, in the Cité Gabriel-Péri in the town of Saint-Denis, so his experience is real enough. Both his parents are of Italian origin, and his father had an Algerian grandmother. But Mr Bardella’s father, Olivier, who moved out when Jordan was very young, ran a drinks distribution business, and was relatively well off. He lived in the commuter town of Montmorency. And Mr Bardella did not go to the nearest state school, but to a semi-private Catholic establishment popular with the middle-classes. “The young Bardella had a foot on either side of the tracks,” said Pierre-Stéphane Fort, the author of a critical biography of the RN president. For a recent profile in Le Monde newspaper, the authors went back to Saint-Denis to find friends and acquaintances of the young Mr Bardella. They found he had left little trace. Friends – of mixed racial backgrounds -- remembered that he was a fan of video games, and set up a YouTube channel to discuss the latest releases. They recalled that he had given literacy classes to immigrants after hours at his lycée when he was 16. But they did not remember any particular interest in far-right politics. “My theory is that he looked around the political world and spotted the place where there was the best chance of climbing the ladder,” Chantal Chatelain, a teacher at his lycée, told Le Monde. Mr Bardella joined the party at 17, and his rise was meteoric. It happened because he became part of Ms Le Pen’s outer circle. Much at the top of the RN operates around personal relationships and clan loyalties, as it did when Ms Le Pen's father, Jean-Marie, was at the helm of the party that was then known as the Front National (FN). Mr Bardella became the boyfriend of the daughter of an old FN hand, Frederick Chatillon.\n\nJordan Bardella joined the Front National age 17\n\nWithin days of being introduced to Le Pen in 2017, she had named him the party spokesman. In 2019 she asked him to head the party’s candidate list at the European elections, which the RN won. He became an MEP. Then in 2022, she made him party president. According to Pascal Humeau, a media trainer who worked with Mr Bardella for four years, Ms Le Pen spotted straightaway how the young man – with his perfect tale of banlieue hardship – would be of service to the party. She called him her “lion cub.” But Mr Humeau is far from complimentary about Mr Bardella himself. The two parted ways after a row over money, so his testimony needs to be treated with caution. But today he describes the RN leader as a product of pure PR. “He was an empty shell. In terms of content there wasn’t much there,” Mr Humeau said. “He didn’t read much. He wasn’t curious. He just absorbed the elements of language given him by Marine.” Mr Humeau said he worked for months on getting Mr Bardella to shed his stiff bearing, and to smile more naturally. “I had to humanise the cyborg. My job was to get people who would otherwise hate him to say, ‘huh! for a fascist he’s nice!’” The biographer Pierre-Stephane Fort is another critic of Mr Bardella who says there is little substance behind the personable image. “He is a chameleon. He adapts perfectly to the environment around him,” he said. “And he is a chronic opportunist. There is no ideology there. He’s pure strategy. He senses where the wind is blowing, and gets in there early.” Indeed, identifying Mr Bardella with any of the RN’s different courants or political clans is impossible. At different times he has been with the “social” wing, with its focus on the poor and building social housing, and the “identity” wing with its focus on race and preserving French culture. But mainly he goes where Ms Le Pen goes. Like her, and the party as a whole, he has a general standpoint built around a tough response to crime and immigration, and has spoken of France being “submerged by migrants”. But on specifics, the answers are left deliberately hazy.\n\nEmmanuel Macron shocked France when he called an election\n\nOn the stump with Mr Bardella, there is no denying his popularity. Young women think he is “gorgeous”, and he has a smile and a selfie for everyone. But watch for a while, and you see the smile routine coming round again rather too automatically. And listen for a while, and you hear the same tropes and formulae coming round again too. At a recent TV debate with the prime minister Gabriel Attal, Mr Bardella held his own, but it was obvious who was the smarter. Luckily for Mr Bardella, Mr Attal blew his advantage by adopting a constant smirk – exactly the kind of condescension that the RN feeds on. For Ms Le Pen, the lion cub has been a huge asset, and has allowed her to broaden the party’s appeal far beyond its traditional social categories. With his TikTok habit, Mr Bardella obviously connects with the young. He regularly posts short videos of himself (which have been packaged up by a media company) to his 1.3 million followers. He also has a good rating among graduates, pensioners and city-dwellers – segments that have proved resistant to the RN in the past. But the question has still not been answered. Is his appeal merely the result of brilliant communication, or is this a man with the right stuff to run the country? He is 28, never went to university, and has no experience of government. He has never held a job outside the RN, apart from a month one summer at his father’s company. Until recently, this would have made it inconceivable that he be named prime minister of France. But do the old rules still apply?",
        "Susannah's grandad ran Bengal when famine killed millions\n\n15 hours ago By Kavita Puri , Presenter, Three Million podcast Share\n\nBBC\n\n\"I feel enormous shame about what happened,\" Susannah Herbert tells me. Her grandfather was the governor of Bengal, in British India, during the run-up and height of the 1943 famine which killed at least three million people. She is only just learning about his significant role in the catastrophe, and confronting a complex family legacy. When I first meet her, she is clutching a photograph from 1940. It's Christmas Day at the governor's residence in Bengal. It's formal, with people sitting in rows, in their finery, staring straight into camera. In the front are the dignitaries - Viceroy Linlithgow, one of the most important colonial figures in India, and her grandfather Sir John Herbert, Bengal's governor. At their feet is a little boy, in a white shirt and shorts, knee-high socks and shiny shoes. It's Susannah's father.\n\nSusannah Herbert Susannah's father, the boy in white in this picture from 1940, told her little of her grandfather\n\nHe had told her some stories of growing up in India, like the day Father Christmas came in on an elephant, but not much more. But little was spoken of her grandfather, who died in late 1943. The causes of the famine are many and complex. While John Herbert was the most important colonial figure in Bengal, he was part of a wider colonial structure. He reported to his bosses in Delhi, who reported to theirs in London. Dr Janam Mukherjee, historian and the author of Hungry Bengal, tells me Herbert \"was the colonial official most directly linked to the famine because he was the chief executive of the province of Bengal at that time\". One of the policies he executed during World War Two was known as \"denial\", where boats and rice – the staple food – were confiscated or destroyed in thousands of villages. It was done because of the fear of a Japanese invasion and the aim was to deny the enemy local resources to fuel their advance into India. However, the colonial policy was catastrophic for the already fragile local economy. Fishermen couldn't go to sea, farmers weren't able to go upstream to their plots, and artisans were unable to get their goods to market. Critically, rice could not be moved around.\n\nHerbert family Susannah says there is no doubt the policies of Sir John Herbert, pictured here with his wife Lady Mary in 1940, \"contributed enormously to the scale and impact of the famine\"\n\nInflation was already high, as the colonial government in Delhi was printing money to pay for the vast war effort on the Asian front. The hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers in Kolkata - then Calcutta - were straining food resources. Rice imports to Bengal from Burma had halted after it fell to the Japanese. Rice was hoarded, often for profit. And a deadly cyclone hit, wiping out much of Bengal's rice crop. Repeated demands - in the middle of the war - to the war cabinet and Prime Minister Winston Churchill for food imports were denied or partially heeded at the time. The numbers who died are overwhelming. I wondered why Susannah, the granddaughter of Bengal’s governor, felt shame so many decades later. She tries to explain. \"When I was young there was something almost glamorous about having a connection with the British Empire.\" She says she used to borrow a lot of her grandfather's old clothes. \"There were silk scarves, with a nametape saying 'Made in British India'. \"And now when I see them at the back of a cupboard, I kind of shudder and say, why would I even want to wear these things? Because the words 'British India' on the label seem inappropriate to wear now.\"\n\nHerbert family Scarves with British India labels don't feel appropriate today, Susannah finds\n\nSusannah is determined to know more about her grandfather's life in British India, and to make sense of things. She is reading everything she can on the Bengal famine, going through stacks of her grandparents' papers at the Herbert archive in the family home in Wales. They're kept in a climate-controlled room, and an archivist visits once a month. She starts to realise more about her grandfather. \"There's absolutely no doubt that the policies he implemented and initiated contributed enormously to the scale and impact of the famine. \"He had skills, he had honour. And he should not have been appointed to the post of running the lives of 60 million people in a faraway corner of the British Empire. He just should not have been appointed.\" In the family archive she found a letter from Lady Mary, her grandmother, written to her husband in 1939, on hearing he had been offered the job of governor. It's a letter of pros and cons. She clearly had no desire for them to go, though she writes she would accept whatever decision he took.\n\n\"You read them [the letters] with hindsight, you read them knowing what the writer and reader did not know. If you could reach out to the past, you'd say: don't do it. Don't go, don't go to India. You will not do a good job.\" Over the months I have been following Susannah Herbert’s journey into the past, she has had many detailed questions about her grandfather. She has been keen to meet Janam Mukherjee, the historian, to ask him directly. They meet in June. Janam admits he never imagined he would ever be sitting opposite the granddaughter of John Herbert. Susannah wants to know why her grandfather, a provincial MP and government whip, was appointed in the first place, when he had virtually no experience of Indian politics, beyond a brief spell in Delhi as a young officer. \"It's part and parcel of colonialism and stems from an idea of supremacy,\" Janam explains. \"Some MP who has no colonial experience, who has no linguistic capacities, who has not worked in a political system outside of Britain, can simply go and inhabit the governor's house in Kolkata, and make decisions about an entire population of people that he knows nothing about.\"\n\nGetty Images Sir Archibald Wavell, Viceroy of India from late 1943, visiting victims of the famine\n\nWhile Herbert was not popular among elected Indian politicians in Bengal, even his seniors in Delhi seem to have doubted his competence, including Viceroy Linlithgow. \"Linlithgow called him the weakest of the governors in India. They, in fact, were interested in removing him, but they were worried about how that might be received,\" says Janam. \"That is hard listening,\" Susannah replies. I am struck that for both there is a personal connection. Janam and Susannah had fathers in Kolkata who were little boys at the same time but were living completely different lives. They've both died now. Susannah at least has photographs. For Janam, there were no pictures of his father as a child. \"So what I knew was from his nightmares and from the few stories he told me of his experience in childhood, in a colonized war zone. \"I come from a sense of trying to think about my father's very damaged life and understand how that impacts me as his descendant.\" And then he says something I wasn't expecting. \"My grandfather also worked for the colonial police force. So my grandfather himself was complicit with the colonial system in many ways. So there are these interesting similarities in our motivations of understanding.\"\n\nAt least three million people died in the Bengal famine and there is no memorial - or even a plaque - to them anywhere in the world. Susannah can at least point to a memorial to her grandfather. \"The church where we worship has a plaque honouring him.\" She explains it's in the absence of a grave. She's not sure where his remains are, perhaps in Kolkata. Honour is a word that Susannah used to describe her grandfather, even though she acknowledges his failures. \"While I find it relatively easy to accept that history is much more complicated than what we were originally told, I still find it hard to envisage John Herbert […] acting in any way, dishonourably.\" Janam takes a different view. \"These questions of intention have never interested me in many ways. I'm much more interested in the historical course of events because I think intentions can always mask what happens.\"\n\nSusannah suggests it is hard to imagine her grandfather acting dishonourably, but Janam says he is more interested in studying historical events than intentions",
        "'I feel broken': Inside the mind of the woman who ran 1,000km in 12 days\n\n15 hours ago By Kelly Ng , BBC News Share\n\nProject 1000 Natalie ran at least 84km a day - the equivalent of two marathons\n\n\"I just have to take one step, one kilometre at a time… Ultra-running is a love-hate relationship,\" said Natalie Dau, in a voice message she recorded somewhere along the eastern coast of Malaysia. The 52-year-old had covered a third of her 1,000km run from Thailand to Singapore, and the going was getting tough. \"Today is the first time in four days I have questioned if I would actually finish this thing. I love the challenge of the sport, love the rawness of it all, but hate these low points. And they come often,\" she said. Natalie had to clock at least 84km a day - the equivalent of two marathons - to achieve her goal of finishing her run in 12 days. Natalie is an ultra-runner - they race distances that exceed 42.2km, the length of a marathon. But she has not trained as an athlete all her life. She began racing only in her late 30s to get fitter. While running has taken off globally, most data shows that growth in Western countries. Figures for Asia are hard to come by, although several countries in the region host popular marathons, such as Taiwan, Cambodia and Japan. The challenge is finding more takers among non-professional athletes who, like Natalie, run for causes, often documenting their arduous runs on social media. \"Whether you come in first or last, it doesn't matter. You've done something almost superhuman, something that only 0.05% of the world’s population will ever do,\" she said. But it takes a toll. She was sunburnt and exhausted from running for hours under the searing South East Asian sun. Her hip had started to seize up on the first day. On day three, she got a urinary tract infection. She eventually crossed the finish line in downtown Singapore on 5 June, along with hundreds of runners who had come to support her on a weekday. Clad in bright running gear, they ran through the city's industrial estates in the early hours, just as daily-wage workers, with their backpacks and plastic lunch bags in tow, made their way to work.\n\nProject 1000\n\nTwelve days of ups and downs\n\n\"The longest I have run before this was 200km,\" Natalie told the BBC the day after she finished her run. \"I was looking for a different way to challenge myself.\" She had the idea to run from the Thai border, through Malaysia, to Singapore in September. Over the next eight months, several friends came on board to help plan for the run, which was later named Project 1000. \"I was a bit naive back then and knew little about what planning for such a run would take. My team asked me things I hadn’t thought of - what happens if you need a hospital? How do we plan the border crossings? How many safety vans will we need?\" Through the 12-day ultra-marathon, Natalie sent nightly voice notes to the BBC recapping the highs and lows of each day. On day five, she said: \"We had a moment to have some breakfast from a roadside stall and enjoyed the view for five minutes before we headed off again. Today was a good day, but I’m not expecting all days to be good. We’ve still got a long way to go.\"\n\nProject 1000 Getting up each day was the “scariest”, Natalie said\n\nShe and her team would sleep just two to three hours each night because they decided on day three that she should start running shortly after midnight to beat the heat. \"Finishing dinner at 8pm and setting your alarm for 11.30pm is not a lot of fun,\" she said in another message. Getting up each day was the \"scariest\", Natalie said after the run. \"I would wake up every morning wondering, 'What if I can't run today?'\" \"The finish line is so far away, you can't envisage it. I couldn't even see the end-of-the-day finish line… You have to get your head mentally in the zone without knowing what that finish line looks like.\" Nearing the end, she described her body as \"feeling extremely broken\". She plastered her toes because they \"were all blistered\". \"I am struggling to walk, tired and just want to get home and see my family. I’ll try to enjoy tomorrow, but I really can’t wait to cross the border [into Singapore], to be honest,\" she said in her note on day 10.\n\n'Ultra-runners want to get uncomfortable'\n\nUltra-runners are \"a certain personality type\", Natalie said. \"In some parts of the world, we all live pretty comfortably. [So] people are trying to get a bit more uncomfortable, and ultra-running is a really good way to do that.\" Beyond that sense of personal achievement, Natalie said she had hoped that Project 1000 would empower women. The run raised about S$50,000 (US$37,000) for GRLS, a charity funding projects that encourage more girls and women to play sports. \"Whether people donated or not, it was a platform to get a message out,\" Natalie said. \"Also, doing this as an older female, I really wanted to prove to people that you can keep challenging [yourselves]. We’re only limited by our own beliefs.\" Ultra-running of this level, however, remains a privilege because it takes time and often needs sponsors and support staff.\n\nProject 1000 Ultra-runners are of “a certain personality type”, Natalie says",
        "'We love you, Papa': Royal children mark Father's Day\n\n3 hours ago By Alex Smith , BBC News Share\n\n@KensingtonRoyal The photo was taken on the Norfolk coast last month\n\nPrince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis have posted a Father's Day tribute to their father, Prince William, in their first social media post. The post reads: \"We love you, Papa. Happy Father's Day\", followed by two red hearts and signed \"G, C & L\". In the picture, taken by Catherine, the Princess of Wales, William can be seen standing on a beach with his arms round his children, looking out to sea. Kensington Palace said it was taken on a trip to the Norfolk coast last month.\n\nIt marks the first time that a personal message from the prince's three children has been posted on the family's social media accounts.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, William posted his own Father's Day tribute, to his father, King Charles III. The prince shared a photograph of himself as a child, playing football with the King in the gardens of Kensington Palace. Taken on 12 June 1984, the then nearly two-year-old prince can be seen smiling while kicking a brightly coloured football. A few months after the picture was taken, William’s younger brother would be born – the Duke of Sussex. The post is personally signed off by the prince, with the caption: “Happy Father’s Day, Pa.” As well as marking Father’s Day, it’s also a potential nod to the England football team, who start their Euro 2024 campaign later on Sunday.\n\nPA Media The photo was taken in June 1984, just before Prince William's second birthday",

        "What happened to the women who took on the Taliban?\n\n2 days ago By Mahjooba Nowrouzi , BBC Afghan Service Share\n\nParwana Ibrahimkhail Nijrabi Parwana Ibrahimkhail Nijrabi was imprisoned after protesting against the Taliban\n\nAfter the Taliban restricted Afghan women's ability to work, learn and go out in public, some women initially defied these new rules, taking to the streets to protest. But soon, those who gathered in the capital Kabul and other major cities to demand \"food, work, freedom\" felt the full force of the Taliban. Protesters tell the BBC they were beaten, abused, jailed and even threatened with death by stoning. We speak to three women who challenged the Taliban government after it began to place restrictions on women's freedom following the Taliban's takeover on 15 August 2021.\n\nMarching through Kabul\n\nGetty Despite protests against Taliban rules, participation of Afghan women in employment has fallen drastically since the takeover\n\nWhen Taliban militants took over Kabul on 15 August 2021, Zakia's life began to crumble. She had been the breadwinner for her family before the Taliban returned to power - but quickly lost her job following the takeover. When Zakia (who is using a pseudonym) joined a protest more than a year later in December 2022, it was her first chance to express her anger at losing the right to work and to education. Protesters were marching to Kabul University, chosen for its \"symbolic importance\", but were stopped before they could reach their destination. Zakia was loudly shouting slogans when Taliban armed police put an end to her short-lived rebellion. \"One of them pointed his gun right into my mouth and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't shut up,\" she recalls. Zakia saw fellow protesters bundled into a vehicle. \"I resisted. They were twisting my arms,\" she says. \"I was being pulled by the Taliban who were trying to load me into their vehicle and other fellow protesters who were trying to release me.\" In the end, Zakia managed to escape - but what she saw that day left her terrified for the future. \"Violence was not taking place behind closed doors any more,\" she says, \"it was taking place on the streets of capital Kabul in full public view.\"\n\nArrested and punched\n\nMariam (not her real name) and 23-year-old student Parwana Ibrahimkhail Nijrabi were among the many Afghan protesters who were detained after the Taliban takeover. As a widow and sole breadwinner for her children, Mariam was terrified she wouldn't be able to provide for her family when the Taliban introduced rules restricting women's ability to work. She attended a protest in December 2022. After she saw fellow protesters being arrested, she tried to flee but didn't get away in time.\n\nGetty Images The Taliban government is increasingly intolerant towards protests like this one, which took place in Kabul in April 2023\n\n\"I was forcefully pulled out of the taxi, they searched my bag and found my phone,\" she recalls. When she refused to give Taliban officials her pass code, she says one of them punched her so hard she thought her ear drum had burst. They then went through the videos and photos in her phone. \"They got furious and grabbed me by pulling my hair,\" she says. \"They caught my hands and legs and threw me into the back of their Ranger.\" \"They were very violent and repeatedly called me a whore,\" Mariam continues. \"They handcuffed me and put a black bag over my head, I could not breathe.\" A month later, Parwana too decided to protest against the Taliban, along with a group of fellow students, organising several marches. But their action was also met with swift reprisal. \"They started torturing me from the moment they arrested me\", says Parwana. She was made to sit between two male armed guards. \"When I refused to sit there, they moved me to the front, put a blanket over my head and pointed the gun and told me not to move.\" Parwana started feeling \"weak and like a walking dead\" among so many heavily armed men. \"My face was numb as they slapped me so many times. I was so scared, my entire body was trembling.\"\n\nLife in jail\n\nMariam, Parwana and Zakia were fully aware of the potential consequences of public protest. Parwana says she never expected the Taliban to \"treat her like a human being\". But she says she was still stunned by her degrading treatment. Her first meal in jail left her in shock. \"I felt a sharp thing scratching the roof of my mouth,\" she says. \"When I looked at it, it was a nail - I threw up.\" In subsequent meals, she found hair and stones. Parwana says she was told she would be stoned to death, leaving her crying herself to sleep at night and having dreams about being stoned while wearing a helmet. The 23-year-old was accused of promoting immorality, prostitution and spreading western culture and was in jail for about a month. Mariam was kept in a security unit for several days, where she was interrogated with a black bag covering her head. \"I could hear several people, one would kick me and ask who paid me to organise [the] protest,\" she recalls. \"The other would punch me and say 'Who do you work for?'\" Mariam says she told her interrogators she was a widow who needed work to feed her children - but says her answers were met with more violence.\n\nParwana Ibrahimkhail Nijrabi Parwana is continuing her activism from abroad\n\nConfession and release\n\nParwana and Mariam were both separately released following intervention by human rights organisations and local elders, and they are now no longer living in Afghanistan. Both say they were forced to sign confessions admitting their guilt and promising not to take part in any protests against the Taliban. Their male relatives also signed official papers pledging that the women would not take part in any more protests. We put these allegations to Zabihullah Mujahid, senior spokesman of the Taliban government, who confirmed women protesters were arrested but denied they were badly treated. \"Some of the women who were arrested were involved in activities that were against the government and against public safety,\" he said. He disputes the women's account and denies torture was used: \"There is no beating in any of the Islamic Emirate's prisons and their food is also approved by our medical teams.\"\n\nLack of basic facilities\n\nHuman Rights Watch's own interviews with some protesters following their release corroborated the accounts heard by the BBC. \"The Taliban use all kinds of tortures and they even make their families pay for these protests, sometimes they imprison them with their children in terrible conditions,\" said Ferishtah Abbasi of HRW. Amnesty International researcher Zaman Soltani, who spoke to several protesters after they were released, said prisons lacked basic facilities. \"There is no heating system in winter, prisoners are not given good or enough food and health and safety issues are not taken into consideration at all,\" Soltani said.\n\nLonging for a normal life\n\nGetty A group of Afghan women protesting in Herat in September 2021 to urge the Taliban to allow their daughters to continue going to school",

        "Are animals conscious? How new research is changing minds\n\n15 hours ago By Pallab Ghosh , @BBCPallab, Science Correspondent Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nCharles Darwin enjoys a near god-like status among scientists for his theory of evolution. But his ideas that animals are conscious in the same way humans are have long been shunned. Until now. \"There is no fundamental difference between man and animals in their ability to feel pleasure and pain, happiness, and misery,\" Darwin wrote. But his suggestion that animals think and feel was seen as scientific heresy among many, if not most animal behaviour experts. Attributing consciousness to animals based on their responses was seen as a cardinal sin. The argument went that projecting human traits, feelings, and behaviours onto animals had no scientific basis and there was no way of testing what goes on in animals’ minds. But if new evidence emerges of animals’ abilities to feel and process what is going on around them, could that mean they are, in fact, conscious? We now know that bees can count, recognise human faces and learn how to use tools. Prof Lars Chittka of Queen Mary University of London has worked on many of the major studies of bee intelligence. \"If bees are that intelligent, maybe they can think and feel something, which are the building blocks of consciousness,\" he says. Prof Chittka’s experiments showed that bees would modify their behaviour following a traumatic incident and seemed to be able to play, rolling small wooden balls, which he says they appeared to enjoy as an activity. These results have persuaded one of the most influential and respected scientists in animal research to make this strong, stark and contentious statement: \"Given all the evidence that is on the table, it is quite likely that bees are conscious,\" he said. It isn't just bees. Many say that it is now time to think again, with the emergence of new evidence they say marks a \"sea change\" in thinking on the science of animal consciousness. They include Prof Jonathan Birch of the London School of Economics. \"We have researchers from different fields starting to dare to ask questions about animal consciousness and explicitly think about how their research might be relevant to those questions,\" says Prof Birch.\n\nwikimedia/canvas\n\nAnyone looking for a eureka moment will be disappointed. Instead, a steady growth of evidence for a rethink has led to murmurings among the researchers involved. Now, many want a change in scientific thinking in the field. What has been discovered may not amount to conclusive proof of animal consciousness, but taken together, it is enough to suggest that there is \"a realistic possibility\" that animals are capable of consciousness, according to Prof Birch. This applies not only to what are known as higher animals such as apes and dolphins who have reached a more advanced stage of development than other animals. It also applies to simpler creatures, such as snakes, octopuses, crabs, bees and possibly even fruit flies, according to the group, who want funding for more research to determine whether animals are conscious, and if so, to what extent. But if you're wondering what we even mean by consciousness, you're not alone. It’s something scientists can’t even agree on. An early effort came in the 17th century, by the French philosopher René Descartes who said: \"I think therefore I am.\" He added that \"language is the only certain sign of thought hidden in a body\". But those statements have muddied the waters for far too long, according to Prof Anil Seth of Sussex University, who has been wrestling with the definition of consciousness for much of his professional career. \"This unholy trinity, of language, intelligence and consciousness goes back all the way to Descartes,\" he told BBC News, with a degree of annoyance at the lack of questioning of this approach until recently. The \"unholy trinity\" is at the core of a movement called behaviourism, which emerged in the early 20th Century. It says that thoughts and feelings cannot be measured by scientific methods and so should be ignored when analysing behaviour. Many animal behaviour experts were schooled in this view, but it is beginning to make way for a less human-centred approach, according to Prof Seth. \"Because we see things through a human lens, we tend to associate consciousness with language and intelligence. Just because they go together in us, it doesn’t mean they go together in general.\"\n\nwikimedia/canvas\n\nSome are very critical of some uses of the word consciousness. \"The field is replete with weasel words and unfortunately one of those is consciousness,\" says Prof Stevan Harnad of Quebec University. \"It is a word that is confidently used by a lot of people, but they all mean something different, and so it is not clear at all what it means.\" He says that a better, less weasley, word is \"sentience\", which is more tightly defined as the capacity to feel. \"To feel everything, a pinch, to see the colour red, to feel tired and hungry, those are all things you feel,\" says Prof Harnad. Others who have been instinctively sceptical of the idea of animals being conscious say that the new broader interpretation of what it means to be conscious makes a difference. Dr Monique Udell, from Oregon State University, says she comes from a behaviourist background. \"If we look at distinct behaviours, for example what species can recognise themselves in a mirror, how many can plan ahead or are able to remember things that happened in the past, we are able to test these questions with experimentation and observation and draw more accurate conclusions based on data,\" she says. \"And if we are going to define consciousness as a sum of measurable behaviours, then animals that have succeeded in these particular tasks can be said to have something that we choose to call consciousness.\" This is a much narrower definition of consciousness than the new group is promoting, but a respectful clash of ideas is what science is all about, according to Dr Udell. \"Having people who take ideas with a grain of salt and cast a critical eye is important because if we don’t come at these questions in different ways, then it is going to be harder to progress.\" But what next? Some say far more animals need to be studied for the possibility of consciousness than is currently the case. \"Right now, most of the science is done on humans and monkeys and we are making the job much harder than it needs to be because we are not learning about consciousness in its most basic form,\" says Kristin Andrews, a professor of philosophy specialising in animal minds at York university in Toronto. Prof Andrews and many others believe that research on humans and monkeys is the study of higher level consciousness – exhibited in the ability to communicate and feel complex emotions – whereas an octopus or snake may also have a more basic level of consciousness that we are ignoring by not investigating it. Prof Andrews was among the prime movers of the New York Declaration on Animal Consciousness signed earlier this year, which has so far been signed by 286 researchers. The short four paragraph declaration states that it is “irresponsible” to ignore the possibility of animal consciousness. \"We should consider welfare risks and use the evidence to inform our responses to these risks,\" it says. Chris Magee is from Understanding Animal Research, a UK body backed by research organisations and companies that undertake animal experiments. He says animals already are assumed to be conscious when it comes to whether to conduct experiments on them and says UK regulations require that experiments should be conducted only if the benefits to medical research outweigh the suffering caused. \"There is enough evidence for us to have a precautionary approach,\" he says. But there is also a lot we don’t know, including about decapod crustaceans such as crabs, lobsters, crayfish, and shrimp. \"We don’t know very much about their lived experience, or even basic things like the point at which they die. \"And this is important because we need to set rules to protect them either in the lab or in the wild.\" A government review led by Prof Birch in 2021 assessed 300 scientific studies on the sentience of decapods and Cephalopods, which include octopus, squid, and cuttlefish. Prof Birch’s team found that there was strong evidence that these creatures were sentient in that they could experience feelings of pain, pleasure, thirst, hunger, warmth, joy, comfort and excitement. The conclusions led to the government including these creatures into its Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act in 2022. \"Issues related to octopus and crab welfare have been neglected,\" says Prof Birch. \"The emerging science should encourage society to take these issues a bit more seriously.\" There are millions of different types of animals and precious little research has been carried out on how they experience the world. We know a bit about bees and other researchers have shown indications of conscious behaviour in cockroaches and even fruit flies but there are so many other experiments to be done involving so many other animals. It is a field of study that the modern-day heretics who have signed the New York Declaration claim has been neglected, even ridiculed. Their approach, to say the unsayable and risk sanction is nothing new. Around the same time that Rene Descartes was saying \"I think therefore I am\", the Catholic church found the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei \"vehemently suspect of heresy\" for suggesting that the Earth was not the centre of the Universe. It was a shift in thinking that opened our eyes to a truer, richer picture of the Universe and our place in it. Shifting ourselves from the centre of the Universe a second time may well do the same for our understanding of ourselves as well as the other living things with whom we share the planet.",
        "Avicii’s dad: 'I miss him every minute, but I get angry at him for leaving'\n\n14 hours ago By Alex Taylor , @tayloredword, BBC News Culture reporter Share\n\nGetty Images The Bergling family want people to know Tim, their son behind the Avicii moniker\n\nOn April 20, 2018, the world lost a music superstar, chart-topping DJ Avicii. Aged just 28, he tragically took his own life while on holiday in Oman. For Klas Bergling, he lost his son, Tim. \"I miss him every minute,\" Klas Bergling shares over a candid, deeply personal video call. \"Of course, I talk to him every day. But,\" he pauses, \"I admit, I get angry at him sometimes. Why did you do it? Why did you leave us?\" Avicii rose to fame as explosively as the bouncing synths on his breakout smash Levels. The 2011 hit, joyously sampling Etta James' \"good feeling\" refrain, catapulted the then 22-year-old Swede to pop superstardom. Over the next five years, as club dance music evolved into the ubiquitous, chart-topping genre known as EDM, with Levels as its anthem, Avicii became its blond, high-cheekboned poster boy - reportedly earning $250,000 (£180,000) a night on tour. Avicii: The superstar DJ behind some of the decade's biggest hits But at 26, he retired from live shows. In a personal note to fans, he referenced his physical and mental health without detailing the full extent of his struggles, which involved anxiety, pancreatitis, alcohol and painkiller addiction. Despite a period of recovery - producing music away from the spotlight - Tim continued to struggle with inner demons in his search for existential answers about his life. Two years later, the darkness overcame him a final, fatal time. If you are affected by any of the issues in this story, the BBC Action Line has information about services that can provide support and advice.\n\nBjörn Terring/Avicii Music AB\n\nNow, his family wants people to know Tim beyond the stage lights, releasing a picture book to honour his legacy. It’s part of the the family's efforts through the Tim Bergling Foundation, set up in his memory in 2019, to open up the conversation around the mental health crisis among young people. Klas, who carefully curated the pictures from Tim's childhood to his superstar life, explains: \"We want to help people see beyond the Avicii fame. That's also why we named his posthumous album 'Tim.'\" Reflecting on the deep connection fans still feel, shown by the thousands of letters and memoriam messages on his website, Klas says: “Tim meant a lot to young people - his music, his lyrics, and his person. \"At first, I didn’t understand why, but then a fan said, 'Tim was authentic.' I understood. Many young people relate to that authenticity, his honesty, and struggles.\"\n\nMillennial star\n\nTim found fame the millennial way, by posting tracks online. He adopted the name Avicii in 2008, a reference to Buddhist levels of hell after discovering his own name was taken on MySpace. Signed briefly by BBC Radio 1 DJ Pete Tong after winning a talent competition, he caught the attention of DJ Laidback Luke by posting on his forum. But Tim struggled with anxiety from a young age, often having catastrophic thoughts and fearing he had cancer. Cannabis use led to fears of madness, disassociation, and derealisation. Klas recalls Tim having intense \"identity questions\" during adolescence. After a few meetings with a psychologist, Tim felt better. However, touring exacerbated his anxiety. A text message in Tim’s 2021 biography revealed Klas' concerns: \"Hi Tim, hoping your inspiration is enough for this huge tour, with gigs every day. One needs to pause and breathe a little, but it’s your choice. Kisses and hugs. Your old man.\" The hectic schedule took its toll. As Levels garnered nearly 20 million views on YouTube before its official release, Tim's tour included performances across the US, New Zealand, Australia, and Asia, often doing multiple shows in different cities on the same day.\n\nCim Ek/Avicii Music AB Avicii's dad is publishing previously unseen photos in a book\n\nTo soothe his nerves, Tim turned to alcohol. \"I found the magical cure of just having a couple of drinks before going on,\" he said in the documentary Avicii: True Stories. This dependence grew as he travelled, telling GQ in 2013: \"You’re travelling around, you live in a suitcase, you get to this place, there’s free alcohol everywhere.\" In 2012, he embarked on a 26-day US tour, which triggered stomach pains from his drinking, leading to hospitalisation and opioid prescriptions for worsening pancreatitis, starting a cycle of health issues and addiction. The following year in Australia, his pancreatitis returned, but he refused gallbladder removal to avoid cancelling more dates and was prescribed opioids again. His appendix eventually ruptured, forcing surgery.\n\nKlas emphasises the need for systemic change in the music industry, but is careful to avoid individual blame. \"I still think that [record] labels, touring people, agents and managers should really have a driver's licence to show they are fit. This is the way artists should be handled,\" he asserts. While he acknowledges some positive changes since Tim's death, noting that \"Swedish managers at major labels are more aware nowadays\", he stresses that more comprehensive measures are necessary to ensure artist wellbeing.\n\nSurvivor’s guilt\n\nTim’s health problems coincided with his (now Grammy nominated) commercial success. His debut album True, which introduced country sounds, produced hits like Wake Me Up and Hey Brother. By 2015, his mental state had deteriorated with pill abuse, anger outbursts and erratic behaviour. Despite promising his second album Stories would be his best, his struggles led to delays, on-stage nihilism and clashes with paparazzi. That summer, Klas and his management knew something had to be done. With a therapist, they planned an intervention in Ibiza. In a Times interview, Klas said he felt he betrayed his son. I ask what he meant and his eyes well. \"You confront your child who is completely unaware of what's going to happen.\" Tim's distressed reaction was evident. \"You see that he realises something is planned behind his back.\"\n\nGetty Images Klas speaking at a 2021 tribute concert for Avicii to raise mental health awareness\n\nBut it was necessary, Klas says. \"There is no doubt about doing it, but coming to that point is not easy.\" Tim, always stubborn, appeared confused, thinking he was being criticised despite working endlessly. After hours of resistance, he agreed to rehab, telling Klas: \"I had decided hours ago but just wanted to test you.\" Klas smiles, feeling proud of his son's \"bravery\". After rehab, Tim fought to escape what he described as the \"machine that was Avicii\" and quit working with his manager.\n\nHillergen Andreas/Aftonbladet/IBL Bildbyrå Avicii's parents Klas and actress Anki Liden stand behind him on stage in 2016\n\nThe Avicii: True Stories documentary, completed before his death, depicted Tim on a beach, apparently at peace no longer touring. The reality of his suicide had to be added as a jarring post-script. Klas admits the grief is compounded by the fact that \"my wife and his brothers and sister were glad that he was improving in many ways.\" It \"may sound contradictory, but that's the way it was - he was improving\". Klas explains guilt is \"such a big burden\" for survivors, who often ask, \"what have I done wrong?\" He acknowledges, as therapists have told him, \"many times you cannot do anything.\"\n\n'50-year legacy'\n\nThis confusion of loss highlights the universal impact of suicide on those left behind as well as the direct victims. The foundation's funding supported Sweden's new national suicide prevention hotline, with the government working on legislation to better investigate suicide. It is part of Klas’ 50-year plan to cement his son’s legacy. At a tribute concert, Klas promised to push suicide up the political agenda. \"We tried to get as many young people there as possible, as well as politicians.” Klas recalls. \"One of the most impactful moments was a big group of parents coming up on stage who had lost their children to suicide. It was such a strong moment.\"\n\nPrivate/Avicii Music AB",
        "Going down the 'rabbit hole' of wearable blood-sugar monitors\n\n1 day ago By Holly Honderich , BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images Continuous glucose monitors have become powerful tools for those living with diabetes\n\nBlood-sugar monitoring devices could soon be on the arms of millions of Americans after regulators cleared two new devices for use without a prescription. Is it a way to improve our health? Or is the data just another distraction? In the middle of the night last June, Cindy Bekkedam woke up to the sound of an unfamiliar alarm. It was loud, like an emergency alert, and it was coming from her phone. More specifically, it was coming from a newly installed app linked to a glucose sensor embedded in her arm. According to this app, her blood sugar had dropped to a concerning low while she slept, which had triggered the alarm. “So I got up in the middle of the night and ate a granola bar,” she said. Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), which monitor glucose levels in real time, have been used by millions of diabetics for years. As a dietitian in Ontario, Canada, Ms Bekkedam had hers installed to better understand the technology for her patients with diabetes. But her two-week trial became somewhat of a cautionary tale. “I was freaking out,” she said. “I actually questioned, oh my goodness, do I have diabetes?” She didn’t. And, after some extra research, she found that her glucose levels were entirely normal. But constantly getting updates on her blood sugar highs and lows, without having a medical condition that required it, incited some unnecessary fear. “That’s where I think people could go down a rabbit hole,” she said. But these devices may be in the hands - or on the arms - of many more people very soon, thanks to two recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for more widespread use. This week, Abbott Laboratories announced it had received federal clearance for two over-the-counter CGMs, including one for those without diabetes. Use of CGMs is already rising, with the tell-tale arm patches easily spotted during morning commutes in major American cities. But experts say that even if there is no proven harm, there is little evidence to warrant spending the hefty fees - as much as $300 (£240) a month - if you’re not a diabetic. Abbott’s Lingo, which is a CGM for people without diabetes, is marketed to consumers “who want to better understand and improve their health and wellness”. It was one of two devices cleared by the FDA for sale, and is already available in the UK. The FDA’s 510(k) regulatory process evaluates medical devices for safety and efficacy, but marketing claims are not part of the review. \"Understanding your body's glucose is key to managing your metabolism so you can live healthier and better,\" an Abbott spokesperson told the BBC.\n\nGetty Images Many experts say evidence is scant that CGMs are beneficial to those without diabetes\n\nAbbott said that flattening glucose curves could help improve energy, mood and sleep and pointed to studies showing the impact of glucose spikes on overall health, and the role of CGMs in monitoring them. There is scepticism about such claims in the medical community, but one thing experts agree on is that CGMs have significantly improved the care of some people living with diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is when an individual's pancreas stops producing insulin, so regular injections are needed. Type 2 diabetes is more common and occurs when the cells in the body become resistant to insulin and so more is needed to keep blood glucose levels within a normal range. It can usually be controlled through medication, diet, exercise and close monitoring, although some take insulin. Traditionally, diabetics monitored their blood sugar with finger-prick tests, but CGMs can alert people with diabetes when their blood sugars are running dangerously high and low, and if insulin needs to be injected. But many experts say that the evidence for CGMs improving the health of non-diabetics is effectively non-existent. They insist the devices are, at best, a distraction and at worse could lead to dangerous fixations.\n\nA growing trend\n\nCGMs are big business. Market leaders have estimated sales will reach $20bn globally over the next four years. Earlier this year, the FDA cleared the sale of an over-the-counter CGM made by Dexcom, meant for Type 2 diabetics who don’t use insulin but want to avoid regular finger-prick tests. And some new CGM startups, like Signos, Nutrisense and Levels Health, now market prescription devices off-label as tools for energy, mood and metabolism. The devices are becoming popular among some in health, wellness and sports industries. Dutch marathoner Abdi Nageeye, who will compete in the Paris Olympics, told Reuters earlier this week he is wearing a CGM to try to better track his body's available energy.\n\nGetty Dutch marathoner Abdi Nageeye wore a CGM during the Rotterdam marathon in 2022, according to Reuters\n\nOthers, including some in the scientific community, have also expressed interest in the effects of glucose on metabolic health. Nick Norwitz, 28, who graduated from Oxford University with a PhD in nutrition and is currently in his fourth year of medical school at Harvard, said he believes CGMs can be powerful tools because glucose is “a bellwether for what’s happening hormonally in your body”. He has studied their use while at Harvard, and said he welcomes more research in the field. Mr Norwitz said he believed that over the long term, the hormonal changes associated with frequent glucose spikes could cause negative effects, including through fat gain. But, he added, glucose is just one metric, and shouldn’t drive all health decisions. “To be clear, I don't think that means if you eat a mango and have your blood sugar go up that it’s 'worse' for you than were you to have a plate of bacon,” he said. Interest in how CGMs can help you change your diet has flourished in some corners of the internet too. Depending on your algorithm, a search for glucose monitors on TikTok or Instagram could lead you to dozens of testimonials from health and wellness influencers espousing the technology’s benefits. One such influencer, Brittney Bouchard, who promoted a particular CGM start-up on her TikTok and offered her followers a discount code, said wearing a CGM helped her adjust her diet to reduce glucose spikes. She received an affiliate commission when people bought the device through her link. “I could tell a difference immediately, in my energy, my sleep and my brain fog,” said Ms Bouchard, a 41-year-old health coach from Los Angeles.\n\nBrittney Bouchard Brittney Bouchard, a wellness influencer, said she's adjusted her diet after using a CGM\n\nIn her opinion the CGM showed her that her body “was unfortunately very, very sensitive to carbohydrates… even fruit”, she said, recalling that eating a pineapple had made her feel “jittery” and sick. “If I have oatmeal I will be tired within an hour.”\n\nA solution in search of a problem",
        "US declines to charge Merrick Garland for contempt\n\nThe US Department of Justice (DoJ) has declined to press charges against Attorney General Merrick Garland for contempt of Congress after the House of Representatives narrowly voted to punish him for his refusal to hand over audio tapes from an investigation into President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Republican-controlled House voted 216-207 on Wednesday to recommend that the DoJ, the department that Mr Garland oversees, file criminal charges against America's top law enforcement officer.\n\nThe move stems from Mr Garland's refusal to turn over to Republican lawmakers recorded interviews from a justice department probe of Mr Biden's handling of classified documents.\n\nIn a letter sent to Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson on Friday, a top DoJ official said the department found that Mr Garland's actions \"do not constitute a crime\". Mr Johnson called the move \"sadly predictable\".\n\nCarlos Felipe Uriarte, an assistant attorney general, said it was a \"longstanding position\" of the department not to bring charges in cases where the president has made the decision to conceal the requested material using his power of executive privilege.\n\nExecutive privilege is legal doctrine that grants presidents the right to withhold executive branch information from the other two branches of US government.\n\n\"Accordingly the Department will not bring the congressional contempt citation before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute the Attorney General,\" Mr Uriarte wrote.\n\nThe House Speaker said he would go to federal court to force the attorney general to hand over the audio.\n\nMr Johnson called the DoJ decision “another example of the two-tiered system of justice brought to us by the Biden Administration”.\n\nHe cited the case of two ex-Trump aides, Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, who tried to cite executive privilege in flouting congressional subpoenas. They were found in contempt of Congress, criminally prosecuted and sentenced to prison terms.\n\nLast month, Mr Biden invoked executive privilege to block congressional Republicans from accessing tapes of his interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur, who was investigating his retention of classified documents after he served as vice-president.\n\nMr Biden turned in the documents once they had been discovered. The DoJ special counsel who interviewed the Democratic US president said that although he had retained the files, he should not be charged as jurors would probably view him as a \"well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\".\n\nThe White House said that Republicans had no legitimate need to access the five hours of audio, since a transcript had already been released. They argued that Republicans wanted to use the audio for campaign attack ads against Mr Biden as he seeks his second term as president this November.\n\nAs the oldest US president, 81-year-old Mr Biden's age is seen by opponents as a key political vulnerability. His Republican challenger, Donald Trump, just turned 78.\n\nTrump is facing a federal prosecution on charges of having retained documents that were meant to be handed over to government archivists after he left office.\n\nHe allegedly attempted to obstruct justice by hiding the classified memos after he had been ordered to submit them.\n\nTwo other attorneys general have been held in contempt of Congress in recent years.\n\nIn both cases Eric Holder, a Democrat, and Bill Barr, a Republican, received similar letters from the DoJ stating that prosecutors were declining to press charges.",

        "Military ‘pause’ on Gaza road inflames divisions in Israeli government\n\n43 minutes ago By Lucy Williamson , Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nWhen is a ceasefire not a ceasefire? According to the Israeli army, when it’s a “local, tactical pause of military activity for humanitarian purposes”. Israel’s humanitarian aid coordinator for Gaza set out the details of the scheduled daily pause in fighting between 08:00 and 19:00 local time, along a key route running north from the Kerem Shalom crossing point, where aid is waiting to be delivered. The announcement almost immediately triggered a furious political assault from far-right government ministers – and a rapid defence from Israel’s army, insisting that it did not signal an end to the fighting in southern Gaza, or any change to the entry of humanitarian aid. The fact that this announcement has proved so explosive highlights the increasingly fraught situation of Israel’s prime minister, caught between the costs of his vague and so far unattainable military goals of dismantling Hamas and bringing home the hostages, and the political allies he relies on to stay in power.\n\nAgencies will still need to coordinate their movements with the Israeli army, and the Gaza director for the World Food Programme, Matt Hollingworth, said the test would be whether that coordination became smoother and faster as a result. But he also said that coordination was only part of the obstacle agencies faced in delivering aid inside Gaza. Sunday's announcement \"doesn’t resolve the issue of insecurity and criminality,” he said. “And this is the most dangerous area of the Gaza Strip right now for moving aid.” Aid agencies reported over the weekend that the continuing war was fuelling acute malnutrition in parts of Gaza. Israel is under pressure – from NGOs, allies and its own High Court – to get more aid into Gaza. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces stiff opposition from two far-right cabinet colleagues, who say they will bring down his government if he agrees to end the war, and who see aid deliveries as delaying Israel’s victory. They reacted furiously to today’s announcement, with Internal Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, describing “whoever made this decision” as “evil” and “a fool”. Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said that humanitarian aid helped keep Hamas in power and risked putting “the achievements of the war down the drain”. That the army could issue this message on a day when Israel was burying eleven of its soldiers, he said, was a symptom of the leadership giving too much weight to international opinion and not enough to the forces on the ground. Both men have threatened to bring down Mr Netanyahu’s coalition government if he ends the war, as America wants. But pressure over the costs of that war are rising at home too. Israel’s parallel conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon has escalated in recent days, highlighting the broader risks of continuing the war with their Hamas allies.\n\nEPA In Israel, thousands of people joined a protest calling on the Israeli war cabinet to bring hostages home",
        "Malawians pay tribute to vice-president killed in plane crash\n\n2 hours ago By Peter Jegwa , BBC News, Lilongwe Share\n\nReuters Saulos Chilima was planning to run for president next year\n\nTens of thousands of Malawians have taken part in a funeral service at the national stadium to pay tribute to the vice-president who was killed in a plane crash last week. Saulos Chilima, 51, was considered a breath of fresh air in Malawian politics. He was an eloquent public speaker and energetic campaigner who held huge sway among the youth who account for more than half of Malawians. At the service, President Lazarus Chakwera promised a full investigation into the cause of the crash and said that he had asked foreign governments to help.\n\n\"I also have the same questions that Malawians have,\" he said. President Chakwera had previously said the military aircraft had crashed because of poor visibility caused by bad weather but Mr Chilima's UTM party has called for a thorough and independent investigation. The president said that the Malawian military would carry out an investigation but that another, independent, one was needed as well. Mr Chakwera and other government officials were booed by some members of the crowd at the Bingu National Stadium. The 41,000-capacity stadium was full, with more people outside. Calm was only restored after the intervention of Catholic priests. Mr Chilima was a devout Catholic and the service included a full mass. He will be buried in his home district of Ntcheu, 180km (112 miles) south of Lilongwe on Monday, which has been declared a public holiday. His coffin, draped in Malawi's red, green and black flag, was brought into the stadium by a guard of honour. The 'magnetic' Malawi vice-president who inspired hope\n\nPODCAST: What will the death of Saulos Chilima mean for Malawi? The service began with moving tributes from his family. His son, Sean, recalled what a loving father he was, how he always had time for children and played games with them. He added that his father had been extremely competitive and always wanted to win. \"Dad was a hard worker who always made sure he got things done,\" he said. His brother, Ben, said the family was grateful to have been given the personal belongings he had on him at the time of the accident, including his watch and rosary.\n\nChimwemwe Innocencia/BBC His coffin was brought into the stadium by a guard of honour\n\nMalawi State House Saulos Chilima was a devout Catholic\n\nMr Chilima died last Monday as he was flying to the northern town of Nkhata Bay where he was to attend the funeral of a former cabinet minister. The entire crew and other passengers on board, including former First Lady Shanil Dzimbiri, also perished. Mr Chilima had a successful career working in the private sector where he held various senior, well-paid positions in business before taking what many thought was a risky decision, venturing into politics aged just 40. He had been vice-president since 2014, initially under former President Peter Mutharika. After falling out with Mr Mutharika, Mr Chilima formed his own party, the UTM. He ran for president in the 2019 elections, coming third behind Mr Mutharika and Mr Chakwera, but the election results were nullified by the Malawi high court following complaints of fraud. In the 2020 presidential election, Mr Chilima agreed to be Mr Chakwera's running-mate, in an alliance of nine opposition parties. In June 2022, he said that as part of that agreement, President Chakwera was to serve for only one term and he would then back Mr Chilima in the next elections in September 2025. President Chakwera has not publicly disputed Mr Chilima’s claim, but in recent public pronouncements he started to hint that he might seek re-election next year.

That's just one poll and, on average, Reform are still back in third place but they've certainly gained a considerable amount of support since Nigel Farage announced he was taking over as party leader and standing as a candidate.\n\nSupport for the Liberal Democrats has also edged up a little in the most recent polls but we still need to wait to see if that turns into a more sustained trend.\n\nHow big are the gaps between parties?\n\nAll polls are based on a sample of people interviewed, typically more than 1,000, which is then weighted to be representative of the country.\n\nThere is always a margin of error, meaning the real percentage could be higher or lower than any one poll suggests.\n\nWe estimate that the true support for each party lies within the ranges shown here.\n\nWhat is a poll tracker?\n\nEach dot in the chart shows one poll result for a party.\n\nWe summarise all that information with an average line that makes it easier to understand the trend.\n\nWhich polls do we use?\n\nTo get an appropriate range of polls for our averages, we use those conducted by members of the British Polling Council.\n\nIts members agree to the same rules on transparency, but the council has said membership should not be seen as a guarantee of quality.\n\nThe polls we include have come from BMG, Deltapoll, Electoral Calculus, Find Out Now, Focaldata, Ipsos, JL Partners, More in Common, Opinium, Norstat (formerly Panelbase), People Polling, Redfield and Wilton Strategies, Savanta, Survation, Techne, Verian (formerly Kantar Public), WeThink (formerly Omnisis), Whitestone Insight and YouGov.\n\nWe only include the headline percentages on voting intention, which pollsters calculate by excluding those people who answered \"don't know\" or \"won't vote\".\n\nMost of the polls included cover Great Britain, although some do poll the whole of the UK. People surveyed do not get the option to choose parties which only stand in Northern Ireland.\n\nWe include data that is in the public domain. Some polling companies will not publish all data for all parties at the same time.\n\nWho pays for polls?\n\nWhere polling companies have stated in their data tables who their client is, we have included this in our table. It is common for polling companies to do their work for news organisations, television programmes and campaign groups.\n\nWhat is the margin of error?\n\nThe true position for the Conservatives and Labour might be within five percentage points of our average.\n\nNine out of 10 polls just before election day have been within that range of the eventual national vote shares in the 2010 to 2019 general elections.\n\nThe gap has been smaller for other parties which campaign throughout Great Britain, such as the Liberal Democrats, Green party and Reform UK (formerly the Brexit Party) and smaller still for the SNP and Plaid Cymru.\n\nHow do we average the polls?\n\nOur estimate of a party's support is a rolling average of polls.\n\nA party's share on any given day is the average of their results from polls taken over the previous fortnight. We only take the most recent poll from each company for that day's averages.\n\nWhy do polling companies have different results?\n\nAll opinion polls will differ a bit because they are interviewing different people. There are also other things that can lead to differences between polling companies. For example:\n\nDifferent companies find the people who take part in their polls in different ways\n\nThe precise wording of the question varies between pollsters, and some pollsters ask more than one question to reach their voting intention figures\n\nPollsters apply \"weights\" to their data to try to make their results reflect the make-up of the voting population. So if a particular poll has a smaller proportion of female respondents than there are in the wider population, their responses will be given extra weight in the final results. But different companies take different factors into account\n\nThe companies have different ways of treating people who initially say they do not know how they will vote, or are not certain if they will vote.\n\nWhat do pollsters ask?\n\nFor voting intention, polling companies typically ask interviewees a question along the lines of: \"If a general election were held tomorrow, which party would you vote for?\"\n\nSome polling companies have not given their interviewees the choice of some parties, including them within the \"other\" category.\n\nFor example, Reform UK, formerly the Brexit Party until 2021, has only been included as an option in every poll featured in our tracker since autumn 2022, while support for Plaid Cymru is included among \"other\" parties in polls released by Techne.\n\nProduced by Grace Richardson, Scott Jarvis, Becky Rush, Allison Shultes, Libby Rogers, Daniel Wainwright, Aidan McNamee, Jana Tauschinski, Debie Loizou, Preeti Vaghela, Robert Cuffe, John Walton.\n\nWhat questions do you have about the general election?\n\nUse this form to ask your question:",

        "Boeing plane investigated after 'Dutch roll'\n\nThe issues have emerged at a time when the safety record of Boeing planes is under intense scrutiny.\n\nThe agency is also involved after Boeing reported learning of potentially falsified documents used to certify titanium in its planes.\n\nIt is one of two new inquiries involving Boeing planes that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has recently confirmed.\n\nUS regulators are investigating after a Boeing 737 Max 8 flown by Southwest Airlines rocked side to side while in air, a potentially dangerous movement known as a Dutch roll.\n\nBoeing referred questions about the Southwest flight to the airline, which said it was co-operating with the investigation.\n\nBoeing also said that the titanium issue was \"industry-wide\", involving shipments from a limited set of suppliers.\n\nIt said tests performed so far indicate that the correct alloy was used, despite the false documentation.\n\nThe company said it sourced the metal separately from its supplier and it believed a small number of parts had been affected.\n\n\"To ensure compliance, we are removing any affected parts on airplanes prior to delivery. Our analysis shows the in-service fleet can continue to fly safely,” the company said.\n\nThe New York Times, which first reported the issue, said a supplier to Spirit AeroSystems, which makes parts for Boeing and European plane-maker Airbus, started looking into the issue after noticing holes from corrosion.\n\nSpirit, which had alerted the two manufacturers to the problem earlier this year, said more than 1,000 tests had been completed on the suspect parts, which had been removed from production.\n\n\"It is the documents that were counterfeit, not the titanium,\" spokesman Joe Buccino said. \"The problem is we've lost traceability.\"\n\nThe FAA said Boeing had issued a bulletin to suppliers to be on the alert for counterfeit records and that it was probing the scope of the issue.\n\nCanadian transportation safety officials said in a separate statement that they were working with foreign regulators to determine a co-ordinated approach to the titanium issue, and that officials \"will not hesitate to take action\".\n\nThe so-called Dutch roll, said to have been named after an ice-skating technique attributed to the Netherlands, occurred on a 25 May flight from Phoenix, Arizona, to Oakland, California.\n\nThe FAA said the aircraft regained control and no-one on board was injured, but the plane suffered \"substantial\" damage.\n\nA post-flight inspection of the two-year-old plane revealed significant damage to a unit that provides backup power to the rudder.\n\n\"Dutch roll can be unpleasant but the 737 exhibits relatively benign characteristics. The time elapsed since the incident, and the absence of airworthiness action on the fleet, suggest that this is a one-off, not another widespread problem for Boeing,\" said Tim Atkinson, a former UK accident investigator-turned-consultant.\n\nSafety campaigners have raised alarm about the quality of recent planes produced by Boeing.\n\nAn incident in which a panel broke off a plane in mid-air in January reignited concerns, sparking lawsuits and increased oversight of Boeing.\n\nBoeing has slowed its production and last month presented the FAA with an action plan aimed at resolving the issues.\n\nTheo Leggett contributed to this article.",
        "Lifting the lid on the world of political betting\n\n2 days ago By Sam Francis , @DavidSamFrancis, Political Reporter Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nAn investigation into Rishi Sunak's parliamentary aide Craig Williams placing a £100 \"flutter\" on the general election has thrown a spotlight on the world of political betting. Gambling on sporting events is now very big business in the UK. Millions will be wagered this summer on the Euros and the Paris Olympics, most of it online rather than the traditional way of entering a bookmaker's. But betting has long been part of the political world too. From the outside, betting on an obscure by-election or a party leadership contest may seem strange - but for some political obsessives it combines the unpredictability and excitement of sport with the intrigue of a dramatic narrative.\n\nOne of the proudest moments in the life of political betting guru Mike Smithson was correctly predicting the result of the 2021 Chesham and Amersham by-election. \"I got the Lib Dems to win at 20-to-1, and I got it right,\" he said. Mr Smithson, who runs the politicalbetting.com website after years as a BBC political journalist, said: \"I love politics and there's nothing like predicting winner and losers. \"People love to look at things and think they know the answer - when you go for a drink in the pub people always end up saying 'I think it's going this way, or that'\". Political betting is often used by betting companies as a gateway to entice new punters to more lucrative - for the firms - betting platforms. \"Most bookies get into political betting because they like signing up new customers who will then be attracted in other areas,\" said Mr Smithson. But some remarkable amounts of money have been wagered over the years. In 2017, an anonymous student placed a series of wagers amounting to £10,000 on Jeremy Corbyn's Labour winning the general election. They lost their money. Mike Smithson estimates \"between £10m and £20m will be bet on the election this year\".\n\nEPA Gambling firms say betting on political events is on the rise\n\nOnline betting exchange Betfair suggests more than £8m has been staked on the outcome of the general election. But these figures do not include bets with the larger betting firms. This makes it a miniscule slice of the £15.1bn UK gambling market. But according to William Kedjanyi, head of political content at Star Sports, political betting has been \"growing steadily over the last ten years\". \"It has been helped by the fact we’ve had particularly volatile events - the 'yes' and 'no' Brexit referendum was perfect for betting. \"People like to bet on very tight events.\" Over the years, the types of political bets have diversified. Traditional bets on election outcomes remain popular, but novelty bets, such as predicting specific political events or decisions, are gaining traction. \"Elections by themselves are perfect betting events – there are lots of options across the 650 constituencies, betting on each one or overall victory,\" says Mr Kedjanyi.\n\nBetting on politics has a surprisingly long history in the UK. Charles James Fox, the 18th-century Whig prime minister, was known to bet \"frequently, largely, and judiciously, on the social and political occurrences of the time\" according to his biographer. During the Victorian and Edwardian periods, gambling laws became stricter, impacting political betting. But in 1963 Ladbrokes began openly accepting bets on political events and by the following year's general election, William Hill had joined in. But people who work at Westminster - like those who work at horse racing stables or football clubs - need to be careful. Using confidential information to gain an advantage could amount to cheating under the Gambling Act - which is a criminal offence. The Gambling Commission is making inquires into Craig Williams, a Conservative Party election candidate and former aide to Rishi Sunak, amid claims he placed a £100 bet on the date of the election days before the PM announced it. Mr Williams has apologised and said he made a \"huge error of judgement\" but has not confirmed the details of his bet. Mr Sunak has described his actions as \"very disappointing\" and the opposition parties are calling for him to be suspended as a candidate or face a Cabinet Office investigation. It is understood the watchdog wrote to all licensed bookmakers this week requesting information on anyone who stood to gain more than £199 by betting on a July election in the UK. Westminster's gamblers will be watching the results of this one with particular interest.",
        "Is Elon Musk worth his $56bn Tesla pay package?\n\n2 days ago By Zoe Kleinman , Technology editor Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nElon Musk might, once again, get his own way. His Tesla pay deal - worth up to $56bn (£44bn) depending on the firm's share price - which has now been backed by shareholders is 75% of the entire spending for schools in England in 2024-25 (£60bn) and around a quarter of the budget for the NHS (£192bn). To his many admirers, Mr Musk is worth every single cent which comes his way - and shareholders agreed, with around 72% of the voting shares backing the deal. His businesses include Tesla, SpaceX, X (formerly Twitter), Starlink, Neuralink and X.ai, his latest AI project. You could argue Tesla opened up the US market for electric vehicles, SpaceX has just sent the world’s most powerful rocket into space, and a man who volunteered to be the first human to be implanted with a Neuralink microchip into his brain can now control a computer using his thoughts. Today, the $56bn question is: would this portfolio have been as successful without him?\n\nTesla's growth\n\nYou could say Mr Musk's pay deal was really about getting him to stay put at Tesla. Prior to 2018, when it was agreed by the company’s board, there had been speculation about his future at the electric car maker. The deal was structured in such a way that if Mr Musk didn’t hit certain milestones – such as Tesla’s market value, sales and underlying profit – he wouldn’t get paid at all. Though, at that stage, he was hardly digging down the back of the sofa for loose change given he was worth nearly $20bn, according to Forbes magazine’s rich list of 2018. But if he did hit certain goals, the potential payday was astronomical. In fairness, Mr Musk has achieved the targets laid out for him. For example, Tesla’s market value had grown from $54bn to the $650bn goal set out in the original deal. It has since slid back down to $570bn. ‘Why I voted no on Musk pay hike’\n\nMusk's profile\n\nWhen Tesla wobbled in 2022, it was said to be because Mr Musk had taken his eye off the ball to concentrate on X – so it was his absence rather than his presence which caused a problem. Yet his profile clearly adds massive value to these firms. Mr Musk doesn’t believe in communications teams, preferring instead to broadcast prolifically to his 187m followers directly on his social network. If you’ve got Mr Musk in your corner, your PR does itself, with mixed, but always high profile, results. He generates endless global news headlines from behind his keyboard, and you could argue that very, very few people have that power - publicity that money can’t buy. Tesla investors back $56bn Musk pay deal\n\nMusk opposes US tariffs on Chinese electric cars\n\nElon Musk sees $56bn Tesla pay deal cancelled in Delaware court\n\nHe also has enormous political clout: he’s met with several world leaders, including China’s President Xi Jinping. He claims to have spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone, and he once livestreamed a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He is a fierce and demanding boss, a workaholic who doesn’t take no for an answer. Former employees say even the most dedicated among them burn out, while he does not. Dolly Singh, who worked at SpaceX for Mr Musk between 2008 and 2013, previously told BBC News he was an \"incredible leader\". \"If that wasn't the case, he wouldn't be accomplishing the things that he is,\" she said in 2022. But she also conceded that working for him was “exhausting”.\n\nRisky business",

        "Bot or not: Are fake accounts swaying voters towards Reform UK?\n\n2 days ago By Marianna Spring , Disinformation and social media correspondent Share\n\nBBC\n\n\"Vote Reform UK\", \"Only Reform UK has a real plan for Britain\" - an account on X has posted these and similar messages every couple of hours since the start of the election campaign. The account, GenZBloomer, is one of dozens across X, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok which the BBC has identified as posting hundreds of repeated messages in comment threads expressing support for Reform UK. Their behaviour has prompted claims from other social media users that they are fake - automated \"bot\" accounts - and they are distorting the online conversation to try to exaggerate the popularity of Reform UK. The BBC contacted people behind the accounts and found that some are genuine UK voters who believe they are helping the party through their own initiative. Others, however, failed to prove they were authentic. I spotted this pattern of comments in posts recommended to the feeds of our Undercover Voters - 24 fictional people based around the UK with social media accounts, created to investigate what content is recommended to different types of voters during the election. The profiles are private, with no friends. They just like, follow and watch relevant content.\n\nMarianna Spring: Why am I tracking 24 phones this election?\n\n\"The main purpose of my account at this time is to restore British culture and values,\" the GenZbloomer account told me in a message. Following concerns about foreign interference in previous elections, some social media users have suggested that GenZbloomer - and other similar accounts - may not be based in the UK. They have pointed out phrases a native speaker would be unlikely to use, such as \"make an article\" instead of \"write an article\" and \"neighbourhood tavern\" instead of \"local pub\". Others are convinced the GenZbloomer profile must be parody - particularly referring to a blog post the account shared on X about how \"young men are struggling out here to find traditional British women to date\" because women think they are \"better than everyone else because of Love Island and Starmer\", referring to the Labour leader Sir Keir. The person who claimed to be behind GenZbloomer told me they were based in \"the Annesley England area\" - an unusual way to describe the small village in Nottinghamshire - and gave me a UK mobile phone number. They agreed to speak to me on the phone, but then did not answer any of my calls.\n\nGenZBloomer has posted hundreds of times about Reform UK on X\n\nOn WhatsApp, their account is labelled as a business account for a \"consulting agency\", and features a profile image of a faceless cartoon figure with a microphone headset on. In messages with grammatical mistakes, they claimed to be a \"generation Z voter\" who wants a \"proper Brexit but the conservatives party ruined\". The account claimed to be working \"with Reform UK\" in order to \"help them win and spread their values across the UK\". The person who had been messaging me provided no evidence to support this claim - and a Reform UK spokesperson said this profile was not connected to the party at all. Reform UK told the BBC it had been in touch with social media companies about other accounts falsely purporting to be connected with the party. Some responses to my messages from GenZbloomer sounded like parody - describing how they would have to speak to a Reform Party county organiser before they spoke to me, but adding that it \"should not be an issue Reform has a super lax vetting process\". After a back-and-forth over text message, my phone number then appeared to have been blocked. Since this article was first published, the GenZbloomer account has been suspended by X for violating its rules.\n\nSome social media users have claimed comments in support of Reform UK are being posted by bots\n\nSocial media users now seem more likely to accuse other accounts of being bots - alleging they undermine trust and disrupt the online debate, even when some of these profiles turn out to be genuine. In the past decade, there have been documented attempts by hostile foreign powers, such as Russia, to sow division and promote particular points of view during Western elections. They have used networks of what social media firms call \"inauthentic accounts\" and what users call bots or \"troll farms\". Whether the actions of these accounts changed anyone’s mind is unclear. In recent weeks, Reform UK has seen a genuine rise in the polls - which may partly explain its growing role in the online conversation. A spokesman for Reform UK told the BBC: \"We are, of course, delighted about the organic growth of online support, but with that come some accounts that are not formally associated with the party, but actively subvert and lie about who we are.\" The spokesman said some people wrongly believe the only way others could end up supporting Reform UK was if they had been fooled in some way by the internet. In total, I found more than 50 profiles that had the hallmarks of inauthentic accounts, posting in support of Reform UK across the different social media sites - although they could still have been genuine. These hallmarks can include a username and profile picture with no identifying features, no followers or seemingly real friends - and engaging entirely with political or divisive content, or reposting the same repetitive phrases.\n\nThe BBC's Undercover Voter profiles in Bridgend were pushed content which included the alleged bot comments\n\nSome had no posts of their own. Others, seemingly based outside the UK, previously posted about US politics and sports or animal cruelty before switching to Reform UK. Several had also shared conspiracy theory content about Covid-19 or posts opposing Ukraine and supporting Russia. I have not found other accounts posting about other political parties in the same way - or being met with the same accusations. Many of these accounts did not respond when I contacted them. But one called username341317847855 did. He said his name was Martin and he agreed to speak to me on the phone from the quiet of his van in London. \"Of course I'm a real person. I'm just fed up with the government. I'm fed up with MPs,\" he said. He made light of the bot claims, joking that I could call him \"Martin the Bot\" and telling me he was not worried that these accusations might undermine Reform UK’s social media posts. Martin said no political parties or users have encouraged him to post. He said he decided to vote for the first time in this election.\n\nThis account had some of the hallmarks of a bot, but the BBC traced it to a first-time voter named Martin in London\n\nSeveral more of these accounts told me they were real people based in the UK, who were just sharing their political views. Some shared evidence with me to demonstrate this. One account run by someone called Matt said: \"I can assure you I'm not a bot. I'm politically homeless.\" He said he was from Bury, was aged 46 and a welder by trade. He does not have any profile picture or posts on his TikTok account, only comments on the videos of others. He told me that no political party or anyone else had instructed him to comment in support of Reform UK. Matt said that when he saw the other profiles posting these comments similar to his on social media, it helped him and others realise \"they are not the only ones who feel this way and have these views\". What Matt’s experience seems to show is that comments that boost the perceived support for a political party - whether they come from UK voters or inauthentic accounts - can embolden more real people to join in. It is one more piece of evidence in this election that suggests individual social media users and anonymous accounts have the ability to shape the online conversation just as effectively as the content coming from the political parties themselves. A TikTok spokesperson has previously told the BBC it has introduced \"more policies to aggressively counter foreign election interference\". \"Creating fake accounts or engaging in inauthentic activities goes against Meta's policies\", a spokesperson for Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, told the BBC. X, formerly Twitter, said they \"remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation\".\n\nTwo of the three Bridgend Undercover Voters were recommended content linked to the Reform UK bot claims",
        "Tesla investors back $56bn Musk pay deal\n\nTesla shareholders have backed a record-breaking pay package for boss Elon Musk and approved a plan to move the firm's legal headquarters to Texas.\n\nThe deal was blocked earlier this year by a judge in Delaware over concerns it was unfair to shareholders.\n\nThe vote is a victory for the multi-billionaire, who had campaigned fiercely for the payout, which is worth up to $56bn (£43.9bn). The exact amount depends on the Tesla share price.\n\n\"Hot damn, I love you guys,\" he told a crowd of enthusiastic shareholders who had gathered in Texas for the firm's annual meeting.\n\nThe deal is worth more than 300 times what the top-earning boss in the US made last year, and more than 3,000 times the average CEO's pay package.\n\nHowever, the vote is not binding and legal experts have said it is not clear if the court that blocked the deal will accept the re-vote and allow the company to restore the pay package.\n\n\"The vote changes nothing,\" said Mathieu Shapiro, a managing partner at law firm Obermayer Rebmann Maxwell & Hippel.\n\n\"It only offers Tesla opportunities to try to use the vote to obtain a better decision going forward.\n\n“It will be interesting to see if another court is willing to credit a vote taken after the trial court’s decision.”\n\nThe eye-popping sum had sparked criticism and raised concerns that the board of Tesla was too submissive and close to Mr Musk.\n\nIn the January court ruling, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled the sum was \"unfair\" and the process for determining the package, by a board dominated by Mr Musk, was \"deeply flawed\".\n\nChancellor McCormick had pointed out that Antonio Gracias, who had been a board director at Tesla, had \"the sort of personal relationship that had him vacationing with Musk’s family on a regular basis\".\n\nShe also highlighted Todd Maron, Tesla's former general counsel, \"who was Musk’s former divorce attorney and whose admiration for Musk moved him to tears during his deposition\".\n\nMr Musk announced that he wanted to move the firm's legal headquarters to Texas after the court in Delaware, where it is currently incorporated, voided his pay package, siding with a small investor who had sued over the deal.\n\nThe fight over the plan had aired concerns about Mr Musk's leadership, at a time when Tesla's share price has fallen from its height and its position in the electric car industry is under pressure.\n\nBut Mr Musk rallied his fan base in support of the deal, appealing particularly to individual investors, who make up an unusually large portion of the firm's shareholder base.\n\nThe pay proposal received 72% of the votes cast, similar to the 73% total in 2018, when it was first approved.\n\n\"It's a pretty ringing endorsement,\" said car industry analyst Karl Brauer.\n\nMr Musk got more than enough shareholder support \"to justify the package,\" he added.\n\nMr Musk had previewed the results in a post on his social media company, X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nShares in the company closed up nearly 3% after Mr Musk's announcement.\n\nThe compensation plan gives Mr Musk rights to roughly 300 million shares - the equivalent to a 10% stake in the firm - as a reward for Tesla meeting a number of goals set out in 2018 which are linked to sales, profits and the share price.",
        "Naked, alone and living on dog food – all for a TV show that gripped a nation\n\n2 days ago By Steven McIntosh , Entertainment reporter Share\n\nHulu Nasubi appeared on Japanese TV in 1998, before The Truman Show and Big Brother\n\nIn 1998, a Japanese man was stripped naked and left alone in an almost-empty apartment as part of a challenge for a reality TV show. Tomoaki Hamatsu, known as Nasubi, was left with only a pen, some blank postcards, a telephone and rack full of magazines. But he was not there to read. The concept of the show was to see if a human being could survive on competition prizes alone. In order to win the challenge, the value of the prizes he won had to reach a certain financial threshold - 1m yen, around £6,000 at the time. He would not emerge for 15 months, following a gradual descent into depression and mania, driven by hunger and isolation. Nearly three decades later, Nasubi's ordeal is being revisited as part of a new film that has just screened at the Sheffield Documentary Festival. \"I came across his story when I was working on a different project and got lost down one of those internet rabbit holes,\" recalls Clair Titley, director of The Contestant. \"But I found that a lot of what I had come across was almost derogatory. Nothing had really talked about Nasubi's story in depth. [I had] all these questions such as, why did he stay in there, and what effect it had on him. So I contacted him with that premise, that I wanted to make a film about his experience.\"\n\nHulu Nasubi entered thousands of magazine competitions to win prizes that would help him survive\n\nNasubi, who had been randomly selected at an open audition, knew he was being filmed, but the explanation given to him about where the footage would end up was vague, and left him with the impression it probably wouldn't be broadcast. In reality, the 22-year-old was gradually becoming one of the country's biggest celebrities as weekly updates on his progress became one of the most popular segments of variety show Denpa Shōnen. Critics mostly hated the programme, but it attracted a huge audience of young viewers. The show began airing before the release of The Truman Show, starring Jim Carrey as a man who doesn't know his life is being broadcast as a TV series. And it would be another year before Big Brother would launch in the Netherlands, ushering in a whole new era of reality television. But despite being a harbinger of things to come, there remains relatively little awareness of A Life in Prizes, as the segment was known, outside his home turf. \"I think people have heard about it more in the last decade, since YouTube has really exploded,\" Titley tells BBC News. \"But at the time, it was never shown outside of Japan and South Korea. It was never intended to be shown outside of that world.\" Nasubi, an aspiring comedian at the time, knew little detail of what the challenge would be before it started. He was left in the windowless room without clothing or basic essentials - not even toilet paper - and had no contact with the outside world.\n\nHulu The film features a new interview with Nasubi as he reflects on his ordeal nearly three decades later\n\nThe Contestant features new interviews with both Nasubi and the producer who masterminded the segment, Toshio Tsuchiya. Other contributions come from those who were involved in covering it - including a former BBC correspondent who was based in Japan. But so much of the story is contained within the footage itself, with viewers of the documentary following Nasubi's progress in the same way TV viewers did at the time. Titley says she and her team went through the original footage \"painstakingly\" to strip out much of the original furniture. \"All the footage was covered in Japanese graphics, it's got Japanese narration, canned laughter, sound effects, it's a cacophony of noise and graphics,\" she explains. \"So we tried to allow an English-speaking audience to understand what it was like.\" The team covered the Japanese graphics with English equivalents, and recreated the audio as accurately as they could. An English-speaking narrator was employed to translate the original commentary. The resulting documentary has already been released on Hulu in the US - with critics as fascinated by the story as they are repulsed by Nasubi's ordeal. The Contestant is \"both a can’t-look-away car wreck and an indictment of viewer complicity,\" said Rolling Stone's David Fear. \"A chronicle of a media phenomenon, a reality TV landmark and a psychological nightmare packaged as entertainment, it is the type of documentary where you’re aware that what you’re witnessing is 100% true, and you still can’t quite wrap your brain around what you’re seeing.\"\n\nHulu The show's producer says there was a possibility of Nasubi dying if he hadn't won rice\n\nIndieWire's David Ehrlich described the original footage as \"so hypnotically sadistic\" that the newer footage struggles to compete with it. \"None of the film’s retrospective interviews, candid and thoughtful as they are, prove as gripping as the raw video of Nasubi’s ordeal,\" he said. \"Titley’s film is ultimately less of a commentary on an entire medium than it is a study of one of that medium’s most remarkable characters.\" As the show progressed, Nasubi was successful in many of the competitions he entered - but the prizes he won weren't always of much use. Among them were tyres, golf balls, a tent, a globe, a teddy bear and tickets to Spice World: The Movie. The fact he was getting weaker seemed of little concern to the producers, one of whom suggests in the documentary that Nasubi could have died if he didn't win rice in one of the prizes. He later also won sugary drinks and dog food, which he survived on for several weeks. Around 15 million viewers tuned in to see his wins, and how he used them in his efforts to survive. Nasubi remained naked for his entire time taking part, because he never won a wearable item of clothing (his genitals are covered by a floating aubergine emoji added by producers).\n\nJoe Short (@joeshortetc) Left to right: Producers Andee Ryder and Megumi Inman with Nasubi and director Clair Titley\n\nThe door to the apartment wasn't locked and Nasubi was theoretically allowed to leave any time he wanted. So why didn't he? \"I think there are a lot of reasons,\" Titley says. \"One is he's very stoic, and that's because of where he comes from in Fukushima, and his parents, who were very strict. \"He's also a very loyal person. He didn't want to get into trouble, and he was very young and naive. He's still incredibly trusting now. And there is also that Japanese Samurai spirit of 'I will prevail and I will stick through this'.\"\n\nSuffering\n\nNearly three decades later, Nasubi has described the show as \"cruel\", adding that there was \"no happiness and no freedom\". \"Maybe three or five minutes a week out of my life [were shown]. And that was edited to highlight my happiness when I won [a prize],\" he told Deadline. \"Of course, viewers would say, 'Oh, see, he's doing something fun and something that he’s enjoying…' But the majority of my life was suffering.\" And yet, he doesn't come across in the documentary as bitter about this experience, and Titley says her impression was that \"he's in such a positive place now\". \"When people have asked him if he regrets it, he always says that while he wouldn't want to do it again, he wouldn't be the person that he is [otherwise],\" she says.\n\nHulu Nasubi was astounded when he was greeted by a live studio audience cheering his name as the show ended\n\nNasubi was finally released via a Michael McIntyre-style stunt, in which he was taken into a new fake room before the walls collapsed to reveal he was actually on stage in front of a live audience cheering his name. The documentary also follows Nasubi after his release, showing his efforts to use his newfound fame for good causes - finally providing him with a sense of fulfilment. Titley says Nasubi felt the timing was right to revisit his story, adding he \"had maybe found some peace with what had happened\". Duty of care practices in the 1990s are not what they are today - and it's unlikely viewers would stand for such a format now. But the documentary raises questions about where to draw the line when it comes to entertainment - and how much audience appetite is to blame. \"I would love people to reflect on their own relationships with social media and reality television,\" Titley says, \"and how complicit we all are as viewers and consumers.\"",
        "Clive Myrie shares emotional toll of broadcasting\n\n15 hours ago By Malu Cursino , BBC News Share\n\nTyler Hall Clive Myrie 'feels as if the pain of others, the regrets, the longing, the sadness affects me more'\n\nBroadcaster Clive Myrie has shared the emotional impact of his work and prominence as a public figure during an interview on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. \"It feels as if the pain of others, the regrets, the longing, the sadness affects me more,\" Myrie explained, adding: \"I haven't got used to it, that's the thing\". The award-winning news anchor also spoke about the impact the Windrush scandal has had on him and his family. Myrie, who is co-presenting the BBC's election night coverage with Laura Kuenssberg, said he feels an adrenaline buzz in what he describes as \"being on the frontline of what it means to be British\". He hopes the election coverage will cater to audiences beyond \"political geeks\". \"I want people to be able to tune in, and get a sense of where this country is going,\" Myrie added. Listen to the full episode on BBC Sounds\n\nAsked about his experiences as a foreign correspondent in war zones, Myrie said: \"You tend to find the best of humanity, and the worst of humanity.\" The difference in narratives made telling stories from conflict zones \"fascinating\", he added. Referring to his many broadcasting roles - as the host of the BBC's Mastermind and travel programmes about Italy and the Caribbean - the 59-year-old said he believed the more people know about him, the more likely audiences were to trust him and the BBC. Myrie spoke to host Lauren Laverne about the importance of role models like Sir Trevor McDonald, who inspired him to become a journalist. But he emphasised he wanted to be a journalist \"who just happens to be black\" - rather than a journalist who solely covered stories about black communities. \"I didn't want my colour to define who I am, and the BBC understood that.\"\n\nClive Myrie will anchor the BBC's election coverage in July alongside Laura Kuenssberg\n\nMyrie is one of seven children to Jamaican parents. Born in Farnworth, near Bolton, he said his family's front room held strong memories of Jamaica and the Caribbean, where his parents and older siblings were born. When asked about the impact of the Windrush Scandal on his own family, Myrie shared an emotional account. The scandal emerged in 2018 when hundreds of Commonwealth citizens part of the Windrush generation had been wrongly detained, deported and denied legal rights. British citizens, mainly from the Caribbean, had been denied access to healthcare and benefits and had been threatened with deportation despite having the right to live in the UK. Myrie's brother Lionel \"now has the right to remain here\", he said. But in an emotional exchange, he said his other brother, Peter, died from prostate cancer before the situation was resolved. \"There are still people who haven't received their compensation. It's just very, very sad.\"",
        "Historic writer's desk could be 'knackered' old fake\n\n14 hours ago By Sean Coughlan , @seanjcoughlan, BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images Museum visitors will be asked whether they believe the piece of furniture really was Dr Johnson's desk\n\nThe desk of the writer Dr Samuel Johnson is to be returned to his former London home for the first time in more than 260 years. Except, in a strange twist, its owner is now uncertain whether it really is the desk of the famous 18th Century dictionary author. It's been suggested that despite many years of being treated as a literary relic, it could have been part of a Victorian hustle to make money. It will be the star attraction of a new museum exhibition, but visitors will be asked whether they now believe it's authentic.\n\nPembroke College Oxford The plaque records the desk being given to the Oxford college in 1867\n\nDr Samuel Johnson was an 18th Century literary giant, remembered for compiling in 1755 what was then the most comprehensive dictionary of the English language. In the TV comedy Blackadder the Third, Dr Johnson was portrayed by Robbie Coltrane, with the painstakingly researched dictionary ending up on the fire. What's now in dispute is the fate of the desk on which he wrote the dictionary when he was living in Gough Square, in a house which is now a museum to his memory. Since the 19th Century the wooden desk has been in Pembroke College Oxford - and the college is lending this prized possession to the Dr Johnson House museum. But when Lynda Mugglestone, professor of the history of English at the college, began to check out the provenance of the desk, there were some unexpected questions. \"The real story is that we don't quite know if it's the real desk,\" she says.\n\nPembroke College Oxford The desk will be on show at the Dr Johnson House in London\n\nIt had come to the college through a clergyman who had been close to Dr Johnson's god daughter, Elizabeth Ann Lowe, and her sister. A plaque was attached to signify its historic importance. But the puzzle is whether those sisters ever really had the desk or whether they used their literary connection as a way of guilt-tripping some famous writers of their era for money. Prof Mugglestone says that as the centenary of Johnson's dictionary was being marked in 1855, the Lowe sisters began writing asking for cash, describing themselves as in penury and with nothing left but a desk which they said had been left to them by the great writer. They were \"living in poverty\" in Deptford in south London, says Prof Mugglestone, and they made clear that \"donations were welcome\". Writers such as Thomas Carlyle and Charles Dickens, who had just written Hard Times, began to fund raise for the sisters. Literary London was mobilised to help the sisters who were the surviving connections to Dr Johnson. The desk became part of that story.\n\nGetty Images Dr Johnson's House, where he wrote his dictionary, is now a museum\n\nDickens wrote of the sisters being in \"great poverty, but undemonstrative and uncomplaining, though very old - with nothing to speak of in the wide world, but the plain fir desk on which Johnson wrote his English Dictionary\". Such pleas from Dickens helped to raise large donations for the sisters, with the desk being saved as a \"proud possession to the English nation\". But Celine Luppo McDaid, director of the Dr Johnson House, says it is now seems unclear whether this desk was actually Johnson's. The case for it being authentic, she says, is that the sisters could have been thinking: \"We've sold everything else, but we still have this treasured desk, it's the last thing we have.\" Or else it might have been a chance to turn a bit of spare furniture into a financial lifeline. \"They might have seen an opportunity and decided that the knackered old desk in the corner was 'Johnson's desk',\" says the museum director Ms McDaid.\n\nOxford University Prof Lynda Mugglestone has researched the history of the desk\n\nProf Mugglestone says women in this era could be extremely financially vulnerable, with few ways to support themselves and such attempts to get money from rich connections might have been their only chance. The Lowe sisters did have a link with Johnson through their father, an impecunious painter Mauritius Lowe, who had lost a grant from the Royal Academy after some rather murky \"misconduct\". Ms McDaid says the painter and his children were living in \"abject poverty\" and Johnson, often broke himself, was sympathetic and helped them with money. But the so far unanswerable question is whether the Lowe family really ended up with the famous desk and had kept it for more than 70 years after Johnson's death. It's from the right era, but is it the actual desk? Researching the desk's origins revealed records of other petitions for money by Elizabeth Ann Lowe and her sister, essentially begging letters - with stories that were not always consistent. The prime minister and the royals were among those getting requests for support. \"She is lying to someone,\" says Prof Mugglestone. But that doesn't ultimately prove either way the authenticity of the desk.\n\nDr Johnson's House The desk will be in Dr Johnson's former home in Gough Square",
        "Drones reveal Antarctic whale 'acrobatics'\n\n2 days ago By Victoria Gill , @vic_gill, Science correspondent Share\n\nA humpback whale shows its 'acrobatic' skill as it creates a bubble net to trap krill\n\nFootage of humpback whales captured by drones has revealed how the animals manoeuvre their whole bodies when they feed. As BBC News filmed with scientists in the Antarctic Peninsula, one whale used its four-metre-long fin to sweep a net of bubbles around its prey and trap them, known as \"bubble-netting\". \"The flick of that of that flipper really shows how adaptable, how creative, these animals can be,\" said Dr Ari Friedlaender from the University of California Santa Cruz. Humpbacks are \"much more acrobatic\" than other similarly sized whales, Dr Friedlaender said.\n\nThe wildlife charity WWF’s global whales expert, Chris Johnson, said the solo whale we watched \"bubble-netting\" was \"using its fin as a tool\" to trap krill, the tiny crustaceans that Antarctic whales eat more than one tonne of each day. Humpback whales are the only species known to produce these solitary \"bubble nets\". The act can only be seen in detail from the air, so the use of drone cameras has revolutionised scientists’ ability to study it.\n\nChris Johnson/WWF/UCSC/Research under NOAA permit Humpback whales working together to trap the krill in a \"bubble net\"\n\nFootage of humpback whales twisting and turning has also revealed how efficiently they can manoeuvre their huge bodies. \"Because of the size of their [tails] and flippers - and their ability to use them to pivot - they’re much more acrobatic than other whales,\" Dr Friedlaender explained.\n\nThe aerial view that drones provide has also shed light on the recovery of whale populations in parts of the world where they were hunted to the brink of extinction in the 20th Century. An international team of researchers, including some from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), has used drone cameras to study whales in South Georgia, a key location for the whaling industry in Antarctica. BAS researcher Stephanie Martin shared with the BBC what she says is the first drone footage of a mother-calf pair of southern right whales off the coast of South Georgia. \"Seeing mother and calf pairs [here] is a strong indicator that these populations are slowly recovering,\" she said. She and her colleagues also filmed an Antarctic blue whale mother and calf - the biggest animals on Earth - feeding in the same area.\n\nMothers and calves, filmed by an international research team and shared with the BBC by the British Antarctic Survey, show whale populations are rebounding\n\nBefore the 1930s, an estimated 40,000 blue whales were killed by whalers in South Georgia waters. Ms Martin said it took until 2020 for researchers to find the giant mammals in those waters again. A survey that year recorded 58 sightings of adult blue whales there.\n\nShrinking whales\n\nKevin C Bierlich Gray whales off the Pacific Northwest coast have shrunk by about 13%, according to research\n\nScientists can also measure whales’ bodies using drones. There is evidence emerging that some of the animals are actually shrinking, which scientists have linked to climate change affecting their food supplies. A study just published in the journal Global Change Biology revealed gray whales that feed in the shallow waters off the Pacific Northwest coast have shrunk significantly in the last two decades. A gray whale born in 2020 is expected to reach an adult body length 1.65 metres (5ft 5in) shorter than a gray whale born before 2000. The researchers say this could be an early warning that the population is starting to decline, or that it is not healthy. \"Size is critical for animals,\" said Dr Enrico Pirotta from the University of St Andrews. \"It affects their behaviour, their physiology, and it has for the ecosystem they’re a part of.\"\n\nChris Johnson/WWF/UCSC/Research under NOAA permit Drones are able to capture playful interactions such as these two humpback whales with a seal\n\nAs well as helping researchers to monitor the emerging threats to whales, drones shine new light on some fascinating marine mammal behaviour. By filming humpback whales working together to feed - something we witnessed in Antarctica - scientists gain insight into how the animals learn and co-operate. \"[When we’ve studied humpbacks] feeding in Alaska and off the US coast, the rules are very prescribed,” said Dr Friedlaender. \"There's generally one animal blowing a bubble net around the prey and the other animals have these individual roles. “In Antarctica, we often see multiple animals in a feeding ground all blowing bubbles at the same time.” Researchers are still working to understand what this means, but some suspect that the Antarctic whales might still be learning the feeding technique and have not yet \"refined it\" to give each animal a role.\n\nAsked if behaviour that we witnessed - humpbacks spinning, circling our boat and even interacting with other species - could be described as \"play\", Dr Friedlaender said yes. \"They have the opportunity to be curious and interact with new objects or to interact with each other,\" he said. \"It strengthens social bonds and I think that's an absolutely critical thing for them.\"\n\nAri Friedlaender/UCSC/NMFS Permit 14809, ACA and UCSC IACUC permits Antarctic minke whales, one of which has been fitted with an orange scientific research tag, photographed from a drone",
        "The cow hoof trimmer who is watched by millions\n\n8 hours ago By Giancarlo Rinaldi , South Scotland reporter Share\n\nMillions of people watch Graeme Parker's hoof trimming videos\n\nWhen Graeme Parker started filming himself at work little did he suspect the global phenomenon he would become. From a beautiful corner of south-west Scotland, he is now regularly greeted by strangers on the street when he visits the United States. It is all due to what would appear to be the most unlikely material to grab social media's imagination. As the Hoof GP, his videos of trimming the hooves of cows are now viewed by more than 100 million people a month.\n\nGraeme is often recognised on the street in the United States\n\nThe 41-year-old grew up on the family farm in Wigtownshire but - after his father's death when he was a teenager - he ended up going into hospitality and moving around Scotland. \"My mother remarried a hoof trimmer, he became ill and I wasn't enjoying the place that I was running,\" he said. \"So I came back to look after his business.\" It does not sound all that glamorous a career.\n\n\"I was freeze branding cows - so basically putting numbers on cows' bums all over Scotland, the Highlands, the islands - I absolutely loved it, I really, really did,\" he said. \"My customers would always constantly tell me - you should be hoof trimming because you've got an eye for detail.\" \"And I said: 'Who on Earth would want to be at the wrong end of the cow, trimming their feet? It is a dirty job, I'll never, ever trim a cow's foot'.\" Things have changed pretty quickly. \"Fast forward a few years and I'm now probably the best-known person in the world for trimming cows' feet,\" he said. \"It was reluctant to begin with but I absolutely love what I do now.\" The filming was initially meant to share with the local agricultural community.\n\nHoof GP Graeme wants to share the reality of working in agriculture\n\n\"To begin with, it was nothing to do with the public, it wasn't for public consumption,\" he said. He used to take photos to show his work to farmers but it became clear it would be easier to stick a video on YouTube and share the link. \"At the time there were hoof trimming videos on YouTube but they were all of a cow's foot that looked almost perfect being made to look a bit more perfect,\" he said. \"Nobody wanted to show lameness and part of that is part of the problem, I think within agriculture, people are scared to show the reality of it. \"The reality of it is there are problems, but everybody tries to fix those problems.\" He quickly started to realise that the questions he was being asked online were not coming from the agricultural sector.\n\n\"The videos grew,\" he explained. \"Within the first month we had about 1,000 subscribers - that was five years ago. \"Now there are 6.8 million people who follow us religiously across all social media channels, and we get anywhere from 120 to 160 or 170 million views per month.\" It has become a business that employs five people and has a worldwide reach. \"Things have got quite big, but I'm still a hoof trimmer who hoof trims and that is my job,\" he said. \"All the other stuff, I always think, I just kind of play at.\" He never for a minute imagined it would be so popular and its reach would go so far. \"I've met people who have these fantastic stories attached to the Hoof GP who are completely removed from my life,\" he said. He is keen for people to see beyond the image displayed on social media, however, and is now writing a book.\n\nThe Hoof GP is also passionate about the corner of Dumfries and Galloway where he lives",
        "'I'm as happy as I've been in my life,' says aid worker Simon Boas as he faces death\n\nSimon Boas explains how cancer diagnosis helped him enjoy life more\n\nIn what he expects to be one of his final interviews, Simon spoke to Emma Barnett on the Today Programme, offering his reflections on life and death as he moved into hospice care.\n\nOver the following year, he knitted together his reflections on life into a book - A Beginner's Guide to Dying. The book is set to hit the shelves in October. It will be a posthumous publication.\n\nIn September 2023, Simon Boas was diagnosed with throat cancer. Aged just 46, he was told the disease was terminal, and that it would ultimately take his life.\n\nMy pain is under control and I'm terribly happy - it sounds weird to say, but I'm as happy as I've ever been in my life.\n\nI used to think I'd rather be hit by the proverbial bus, but having a couple of months knowing this is coming has really helped me both do the boring 'death-min', but also get my thoughts and prepare myself, and feel so accepting of what's to come.\n\nIt's been such a great bonus, actually.\n\nThe book is called A Beginner's Guide to Dying, but really what I'm trying to convey is how enjoying life to the full kind of prepares you for this.\n\nIn some ways I was lucky that my life and my career have taken me to quite a lot of places where death is more a part of life than it is for us in the West.\n\nI spent my life as an aid worker - quite a lot with the UN - and I've lived in places where death is something that not just exists in the background, but is imminently possible.\n\nI spent three years running a UN office in the Gaza Strip. I spent a lot of time in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and I've been working in Ukraine. Seeing people there for whom death is such a part of life - they lose children, they don't know where the next meal is coming from - has really helped me.\n\nI've also been a Samaritan for the past four years. In some cases you are on the line while people end their lives, so I think death has been more a part of my life than for many people.\n\nIt does us all good to think about it.\n\nThat's not in a gloomy way... by kind of realising it's inevitable and it's a part of life, it actually throws life into perspective and helps you to enjoy it more and prioritise the important things.\n\nMy family are about to go through the most difficult thing in their lives. My lovely wife, Aurelie, and my parents... are well surrounded, and I hope that my cheerfulness in the leaving of life might perhaps help them in the next few years...\n\nAll our lives are little books - but they're not someone else's complete book. You're a chapter or a page or a footnote in someone else's life and they are going to keep writing beautiful chapters when you are gone.\n\nAnd those green shoots can grow around grief and put it in perspective. I hope people will think, \"I'm glad I read that - Simon's story\". And just because it's over, doesn't mean it's gone.\n\nYou don't need to have been a politician or a mover and shaker or an aid worker or anything in life. All of us make a huge difference.\n\nI love this quote from George Eliot's Middlemarch:\n\n\"The effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistorical acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.”\n\nAll of us make a huge difference in life. I love the idea that most films about time travel revolve around changing one tiny thing in the past, and of course they come back to the present and everything is different.\n\nIf you project that forward, you can change huge amounts of things into the future.\n\nAll our tombs will be unvisited in a few years - all our actions will mostly be unremembered - but the smile you gave the checkout lady or the kind words you gave to a stranger in the street could still be rippling forward.\n\nWe all have that opportunity and it's a huge power. And I want everyone to realise how special and precious they are.\n\nI love melted cheese. Unfortunately I haven't been able to eat since Christmas. The chemotherapy killed my taste buds and the radiotherapy killed my salivary glands.\n\nSo, sadly, melted cheese and all the things I loved are off the menu.\n\nHowever, I've been given full permission by my oncologist and my hospice team to enjoy as much Muscadet and as many cheeky rollups as I want - and I shall certainly be indulging in those and spending time with my family.\n\nI'm sort of - not looking forward to my final day - of course that's the wrong way to see it. But I'm kind of curious about it, and I'm happy and I'm ready.\n\nAs Julian of Norwich said: \"All shall be well, and all shall be well and all manner of things shall be well.\"",
        "Study links weight-loss drug to rare eye condition\n\n3 days ago Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nPeople prescribed semaglutide, sold as Ozempic and Wegovy, to lose weight, may have a higher risk of developing a serious but rare eye condition, a study suggests. Analysing 17,000 patients over six years, US researchers found those taking the drug for type 2 diabetes were four times more likely to be diagnosed with the condition than patients not on the drug. Among those taking it for obesity, the risk of the condition was seven times higher. But the researchers cannot prove semaglutide caused the eye condition, which can lead to loss of vision in one eye, nor can they explain the increased risk or the difference between the groups. The numbers affected were small.\n\n'Beach-body ready'\n\nNovo Nordisk, the company that makes the drug, said patient safety was “a top priority” but the study had lots of limitations. Trials show semaglutide can help people with obesity lose more than 10% of their body weight, if they also make changes to diet and lifestyle. There has been huge hype around the drug after celebrities on social media starting posting about their sudden weight loss while taking it. Despite it being available on prescription only to people with type 2 diabetes (Ozempic) and the most obese (Wegovy), online pharmacies are selling semaglutide injections with few checks on the weight or underlying health of the person buying them. And as a result, health bosses say they are worried the drug is being misused as \"a quick fix\" for people trying to get \"beach-body ready\". All medicines carry potential side-effects. Some of the most common for semaglutide include: nausea\n\nvomiting\n\ndiarrhoea\n\nstomach pain\n\nconstipation A change in vision is listed as one of the more serious potential side-effects, on both Ozempic and Wegovy's safety information for patients.\n\nNon-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), affects up to 10 out of 100,000 people in the general population, the researchers, from Harvard Medical School, report in journal JAMA Ophthalmology. It is thought to be caused by reduced blood flow to an optic nerve and cannot currently be treated. The study revealed: 17 cases among type 2 diabetes patients taking semaglutide\n\nsix cases among type 2 diabetes patient taking other drugs\n\n20 cases among overweight and obese patients taking semaglutide\n\nthree cases among overweight and obese patients taking a different drug Harvard Medical School ophthalmology professor Dr Joseph Rizzo said: \"Our findings should be viewed as being significant but tentative, as future studies are needed to examine these questions in a much larger and more diverse population.\" UK eye experts from the Royal College of Ophthalmologists recommend patients taking semaglutide are informed of the small risk of developing eye diseases.\n\nBalance of side-effects and benefits\n\nBecause of the small numbers of patients affected by the eye condition in the study - who may not have been taking their medication as prescribed or be representative of the wider population - the statistics on risk may not be accurate.\n\nNovo Nordisk said the study did not take into account whether patients smoked or for how long they had had diabetes. And there were challenges in accurately coding and identifying cases of the eye condition. A spokesperson said: \"NAION is not listed as a known adverse drug reaction\" for marketed formulations of semaglutude - Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy. \"Semaglutide has been studied in large real-world evidence studies and robust clinical development programmes.\" The drug is also being examined in a trial called Focus, which concludes in 2027, to assess its long-term effects on diabetic retinopathy - an eye condition in type 2 diabetes patients.",
        "Australian state orders sperm bank purge over mix-ups\n\nQueensland's fertility industry has come under scrutiny in recent years\n\nA purge of frozen sperm has been ordered in the Australian state of Queensland, after an audit by its health watchdog found almost half of fertility samples were at risk of misidentification.\n\nSuch mix-ups can rob parents and donor children of key genetic information and medical records, and advocates say creates a danger of accidental incest.\n\nQueensland is home to one of the country’s largest IVF industries, however it is self-regulated and has come under scrutiny as some of its biggest providers face claims of malpractice.\n\nThe clean out compounds a national shortage of donated sperm which has been driven by high demand, tightening regulations, and pandemic-related disruptions.\n\nOne in six Australian couples face difficulty trying to start a family, government data shows, with many increasingly relying on donors to conceive.\n\nAn inquiry into the multi-million-dollar sector in Queensland by the state’s health ombudsman this week found “systemic issues” concerning “quality and safety” and “safeguards for consumers, donors and donor-conceived children”.\n\nThe report detailed how 42% of sperm donations, egg samples and embryos in Queensland had “ identification and traceability” issues - meaning clinics had lost track of or incorrectly labelled samples, or allowed them to deteriorate below laboratory standards.\n\nIt also aired allegations from patients who accused IVF providers of failing to disclose the medical conditions of donors, misidentifying eggs and embryos, and mixing up sperm - which one family said had resulted in them parenting children from different biological fathers.\n\nThe body recommended that all fertility providers destroy stored donor material that does not meet current identification standards.\n\n“The impact on consumers and the donor-conceived children... cannot be underestimated,” the report concluded, adding that “appropriate counselling should be offered” by fertility providers.\n\nIt is unclear how many sperm samples could be destroyed, but the ombudsman deemed \"thousands\" frozen before 2020 as \"high risk” because they “did not comply with double witnessing” - a practice in which two IVF professionals check a patient’s material has been labelled correctly.\n\nAnastasia Gunn - a mother suing one of Queensland’s fertility providers for allegedly providing her with the wrong sperm in 2014 - told the Guardian Australia she was “horrified [but] not surprised” by the ombudsman’s findings.\n\n“It is scary to think how many patients may have unknowingly conceived with the wrong sperm.\n\n“Why were the clinics not double-checking when they were making humans? The effects of these errors last for generations,” she added.",
        "Doctors dismissed these women as hysterical. Now they're fighting back\n\n4 days ago By Hannah Ritchie , BBC News, Sydney Share\n\nHeidi Metcalf A recent government survey found that two thirds of women, like Heidi Metcalf, have encountered gender bias or discrimination in Australian healthcare\n\nThere’s a memory, or more specifically a moment, that came to define Heidi Metcalf’s second birth. It wasn’t saying goodbye to her husband and newborn before being wheeled into an operating theatre, or the heart attack she thought she was having as she lay there on the table. It was when a male obstetrician “ripped the placenta” out of her body, without word or warning. A nurse, Ms Metcalf knows the intervention - while immensely painful - was necessary. She couldn't push it out naturally, which was causing potentially fatal bleeding. But she hadn’t “seen or met this man before”, and she can’t get past the fact that her consent, during one of the most traumatic experiences of her life, “meant so little”. “It felt like a violation - I needed to feel involved in what was happening to my body, and not just like a bystander.” Ms Metcalf is one of thousands of Australian women who have come forward to tell their stories, after the federal government assembled a team of experts to tackle what it calls “medical misogyny”. So far, they have uncovered that a staggering two-thirds of females nationwide have encountered gender bias or discrimination in healthcare. And many say it is taking place when they're at their most vulnerable, such as during intimate examinations, or like Ms Metcalf, while in labour. Others report having their pain dismissed or dangerously misdiagnosed. The BBC spoke to six women for this piece. They shared experiences of being called “anxious”, “pushy” or even “hysterical” while seeking treatment for a range of debilitating symptoms. They also said they felt that the men in their lives seemed to consistently have their pain taken more seriously.\n\n'I just don't feel safe'\n\nNadiah Akbar was once told by a doctor in Singapore that the extreme fatigue she was experiencing was due to the “stress” of being a busy mother. Tests would later show it was thyroid cancer.\n\nNadiah Akbar Nadiah Akbar says she has been misdiagnosed repeatedly - often having her symptoms dismissed as stress releated\n\nYears later, in remission and having migrated to Australia, staff at a Melbourne hospital failed to diagnose a cartilage tear in her hip socket and a slipped disk in her back. Instead, they suggested the crippling pain could be linked to “depression” or being “overtired”. It led to Ms Akbar paying for two costly MRI scans out of pocket to be taken seriously. “‘Oh, it’s nothing.’ I’ve heard that statement so many times... It’s really disheartening as a human being to keep hearing that,” she says. “It takes a lot of energy for you to keep advocating for yourself, and that’s the part that’s worrying - a lot of people just stop.” Laura - who asked to have her name changed - is close to that point, after years of having symtoms of what would eventually be confirmed as a traumatic brain injury dismissed. “I don’t get healthcare without my partner with me, that’s a blanket rule,” she says, explaining that she feels her concerns are taken “more seriously” when voiced by a man. “I just don't feel safe, engaging with the system, because when you're young and you're told over and over that something is all in your head, it's easy to believe it.” Like so many others across the country, both women say they’re coming forward to share their experiences to seize on this moment of promised change. Assistant health minister Ged Kearney - who chairs the national council tasked with examining these issues - says that their stories, along with those of countless others facing additional disadvantage in First Nations, LGBTQ+, and migrant communities will guide its work. Her team's remit is vast and broad areas of focus have already emerged. But untangling gender inequity in medicine is no small task, and Australia’s attempts could have far-reaching implications as other nations eye reforms.\n\nGed Kearney Assistant health minister Ged Kearney with her daughter and granddaughter\n\n'A one-size-fits-all approach'\n\nThe problem is not that “all healthcare professionals have some set agenda against women”, Ms Kearny says. Rather it's that bias is woven into the fabric of modern medicine because for centuries it was “delivered by and designed for” men. Women’s health - by contrast – was often rooted in myth and pernicious gender stereotypes. “Hysteria”, a now-defunct medical term, was a catch-all diagnosis for females presenting with an array of symptoms, meaning their pain was attributed to emotional causes, rather than biological ones. But today, some women say they continue to feel gaslit - disbelieved and patronised - in medical settings. And a lack of diversity in medical research compounds the issue. More than 70% of participants in early-stage clinical trials globally are still white men, while male cells and animals are used as standard in the lab, according to Professor Robyn Norton, a public health expert. The results are then applied to women, intersex, trans and gender-diverse people, causing issues when it comes to their treatment, diagnosis and how their symptoms are understood, Prof Norton says. She describes it as a “one-size-fits-all, male-centric” approach to healthcare that has created huge knowledge gaps. One analysis carried out in 2019 by the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research - which used data from the entire Danish population - found that, across 770 diseases they studied, women were diagnosed later than men, with an average lag time of four years. In Australia, research from the University of Sydney in 2018 found that females admitted to hospital for serious heart attack were half as likely as men to get proper treatment and that they died at twice the rate six months after discharge. Scientists have warned that another roadblock is the chronic underinvestment in women-specific health issues. Endometriosis is pointed to as a key example. Despite impacting roughly 10% of reproductive-age women and girls globally, there is no cure, and it takes seven years on average for patients to be diagnosed. One recent study found that 89% of Australian women were still being advised by health professionals that pregnancy would fix their symptoms - despite growing evidence it's a medical fallacy. Such disparities are being recognised and investigated globally, experts say - with countries comparing notes on what might be the best approach. The UK, for one, recently announced measures aimed at closing the “gender health gap” in its system. And in the US, the federal government has launched an initiative to improve funding and research into women’s health, led by First Lady Jill Biden.\n\nBonney Corbin/Australian Women's Health Alliance Bonney Corbin has spent her career trying to make Australian healthcare more equitable",
        "US pays Moderna $176m to develop bird-flu jab\n\n4 days ago By Michelle Roberts , Digital health editor, BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe US government has given Moderna $176m (£139m) to develop a messenger-ribonucleic-acid-based (mRNA) pandemic influenza vaccine that would work against bird flu. It says it wants to be \"better prepared\" for public-health crises, having learned lessons from Covid. Bird flu is not a big threat to people, despite outbreaks in poultry and cattle. But experts want a working vaccine that could be quickly rolled out, in case the virus mutates and becomes a problem.\n\nVaccines using mRNA technology - which the Moderna's Covid jab is also based on - can be produced more quickly. And the US government says adding this technology to its pandemic-flu toolkit enhances its ability to be \"nimble and quick\" against bird flu. The $176m, from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, will be used to complete late-stage development and testing of Moderna's vaccine against H5N1 avian influenza.\n\nPotentially fatal",
        "Dying together: Why a happily married couple decided to stop living\n\n7 days ago By Linda Pressly , BBC News Share\n\nBBC Jan (70) and Els (71) photographed two days before they died\n\nJan and Els were married for almost five decades. In early June, they died together after being given lethal medication by two doctors. In the Netherlands, this is known as duo-euthanasia. It’s legal, and it’s rare - but every year, more Dutch couples choose to end their lives this way.\n\nSome people might find this article upsetting.\n\nThree days before they voluntarily take their last breath, Jan and Els’ campervan sits on a sunlit marina in Friesland, in the Netherlands’ north. They’re a couple who love being mobile, and have lived most of their marriage in a motorhome, or on boats. “We tried sometimes [to live] in a pile of stones - a house,” jokes Jan, when I visit them, “but it doesn’t work.” He’s 70, and sits in the swivel driving-seat of the van, one leg bent underneath him in the only position that eases his continuous back pain. His wife, Els, is 71 and has dementia. Now, she struggles to formulate her sentences. “This is very good,” she says, standing up easily and pointing to her body. “But this is terrible,” she says, pointing to her head. Jan and Els met in kindergarten - theirs was a lifelong partnership. When he was young, Jan played hockey for the Netherlands’ national youth team, and then became a sports coach. Els trained as a primary school teacher. But it was their shared love of water, boats, and sailing that defined their years together. As a young couple they lived on a houseboat. They later bought a cargo boat and built a business transporting goods around the Netherlands’ inland waterways. Meanwhile, Els gave birth to their only son (who asked not to be named). He became a weekly boarder at school and spent weekends with his parents. During school holidays when their child was onboard too, Jan and Els looked for work trips that would take them to interesting places – along the river Rhine, or to the Netherlands’ islands. By 1999, the inland cargo business had become very competitive. Jan was experiencing serious back pain from the heavy-duty work he had been doing for more than a decade. He and Els moved on land, but after a few years they were again living on a boat. When that became too much to manage, they bought their spacious campervan. Jan had surgery on his back in 2003, but it didn’t improve. He had halted a heavy regime of pain killers and could no longer work, but Els was still busy teaching. Sometimes they talked about euthanasia - Jan explained to his family he didn’t want to live too long with his physical limitations. It was around this time the couple joined NVVE – the Netherlands’ “right to die” organisation. “If you take a lot of medicine, you live like a zombie,” Jan told me. “So, with the pain I have, and Els’ illness, I think we have to stop this.” When Jan says “stop this”, he means - stop living.\n\nJan pictured with his son in 1982\n\nIn 2018, Els retired from teaching. She was showing early signs of dementia but resisted seeing a doctor – perhaps because she had witnessed the decline and death of her father with Alzheimer’s. But there came a point when her symptoms couldn’t be ignored. In November 2022, after being diagnosed with dementia, Els stormed out of the doctor’s consulting room, leaving her husband and son behind. “She was furious – like a steaming bull,” remembers Jan. It was after Els learned her condition wouldn’t improve that she and Jan, with their son, began to discuss duo-euthanasia – the two of them dying together. In the Netherlands, euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal if someone makes a voluntary request, and their suffering – physical or psychological – is assessed by doctors as “unbearable”, with no prospect of improvement. Every person who requests assisted dying is assessed by two doctors – the second checking the evaluation made by the first.\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIn 2023, 9,068 people died by euthanasia in the Netherlands – around 5% of the total number of deaths. There were 33 instances of duo-euthanasia, so 66 people. These are complex cases made even more so if one of the partners has dementia, where there can be uncertainty about their capacity to give consent. “A lot of doctors don’t even want to think about performing euthanasia on a patient with dementia,” says Dr Rosemarijn van Bruchem, a geriatrician and ethicist at the Erasmus Medical Centre, in Rotterdam. This was the position of Jan and Els’ GP. And that reluctance among doctors is reflected in the euthanasia figures. Of the thousands who died in 2023, 336 had dementia. So how do medics assess the legal requirement for “unbearable suffering” in patients with dementia? For many with early stage dementia, it's uncertainty about how things might progress that can lead them to think about ending their life, explains Dr van Bruchem. “Am I going to not be able to do the things I find important? Am I going to not recognise my family anymore? If you can express that well enough, if it is perceivable for both the doctor that is willing to perform euthanasia, as well as the [second] doctor that is specialised in mental competency, the existential fear of what is to come can be the reason to consider euthanasia.”\n\nEls, photographed in 1968, was diagnosed with dementia later in life\n\nWith their GP unwilling to engage, Jan and Els approached a mobile euthanasia clinic - the Centre of Expertise on Euthanasia. It supervised around 15% of assisted deaths last year in the Netherlands, and, on average, grants about a third of the requests it receives. In the case of a couple wishing to end their lives together, medics must be certain one partner isn’t influencing the other. Dr Bert Keizer has attended two duo euthanasia cases. But he also recalls meeting another couple, when he suspected the man was coercing his wife. On a further visit, Dr Keizer talked to the woman alone. “She said she had so many plans…!” Dr Keizer says, explaining that the woman clearly realised her husband was gravely ill, but had no plans to die with him. The euthanasia process was halted and the man died from natural causes. His wife is still alive.\n\nDr Theo Boer, professor of healthcare ethics at the Protestant Theological University, is one of the Netherlands’ few outspoken critics of euthanasia, and believes progress in palliative care often mitigates the need for its use. “I would say that killing by a doctor could be justified. However, that needs to be an exception.” What worries Dr Boer is the impact of duo-euthanasia cases – especially after one of the Netherlands’ former prime ministers and his wife chose to die together earlier this year, and made global headlines. “In the past year we’ve seen dozens of cases of duo-euthanasia, and there’s a general tendency to ‘hero-ify’ dying together,” says Dr Boer. “But the taboo on intentional killing - that’s eroding, and especially when it comes to duo-euthanasia.\"\n\nJan and Els could probably go on living indefinitely in their campervan. Do they feel they might be dying too soon? “No, no, no – I cannot see it,” says Els. \"I’ve lived my life, I don’t want pain anymore,” says her husband. “The life we’ve lived, we’re getting old [for it]. We think it has to be stopped.” And there’s something else. Els has been assessed by doctors who say she still has the capacity to decide for herself that she wants to die - but this could change if her dementia becomes more advanced. None of this has been easy for Jan and Els’ son. “You don’t want to let your parents die,\" explains Jan. \"So there have been tears - our son said, ‘Better times will come, better weather’ - but not for me.” Els feels the same. “There is no other solution.”\n\nEls and Jan on their wedding day, 1975\n\nThe day before their appointment with the euthanasia doctors, Els, Jan, their son and grandchildren were together. Ever practical, Jan wanted to explain the idiosyncrasies of the campervan, so it would be ready to sell. “Then I went for a walk on the beach with my mum,” their son says. “The kids were playing, there were some jokes… It was a very strange day. “I remember we were having dinner in the evening, and I got tears in my eyes just watching us all having that final dinner together.” On Monday morning, everyone gathered at the local hospice. The couple’s best friends were there, brothers of both Jan and Els, and their daughter-in-law with their son. “We had two hours together, before the doctors came,” he says. “We spoke about our memories… And we listened to music.” Idlewild by Travis for Els, the Beatles’ Now and Then for Jan. “The final half hour was difficult,” their son says. “The doctors arrived and everything happened quickly - they follow their routine, and then it’s just a matter of minutes.” Els van Leeningen and Jan Faber were administered lethal medication by doctors and died together on Mon 3 June 2024. Their campervan still hasn’t been put up for sale. Els and Jan’s son has decided to keep it for a bit, and go on holiday with his wife and children. “I’ll sell it in the end,” he says. “First I want to make some memories for the family.”",
        "Deaths mount as Pakistan swelters in heatwave\n\nIn Karachi, a man has his face sprayed on to cool off during a heat wave\n\nAs the temperatures rose in southern Pakistan, so did the body count.\n\nThe Edhi ambulance service says it usually takes around 30 to 40 people to the Karachi city morgue daily.\n\nBut over the last six days, it has collected some 568 bodies - 141 of them on Tuesday alone.\n\nIt is too early to say exactly what the cause of death was in every case.\n\nHowever, the rising numbers of dead came as temperatures in Karachi soared above 40C (104F), with the high humidity making it feel as hot as 49C, reports said.\n\nPeople have been heading to hospitals seeking help.\n\nCivil Hospital Karachi admitted 267 people with heatstroke between Sunday and Wednesday, said Dr Imran Sarwar Sheikh, head of the emergency department. Twelve of them died.\n\n“Most of the people who we saw coming into the hospital were in their 60s or 70s, although there were some around 45 and even a couple in their 20s,” Dr Sheikh told the BBC.\n\nSymptoms including vomiting, diarrhoea and a high fever.\n\n“Many of those we saw had been working outside. We’ve told them to make sure they drink plenty of water and wear light clothes in these high temperatures.”\n\nThe high temperatures - described as a “partial heatwave” by one meteorologist – began at the weekend.\n\nHeatwave centres and camps were set up to try to provide relief to the public.\n\nPictures show children playing in fountains as they tried to cool off.\n\n“Look at me! My clothes are totally drenched in sweat,” Mohammad Imran told Reuters news agency as he struggled to keep cool on Monday.\n\nNot all those who needed help made it to hospital.\n\nWasim Ahmed knew he wasn’t feeling well when he arrived home.\n\nThe 56-year-old security guard had just finished a 12 hour overnight shift outside. Even then, he had found the temperatures too much.\n\n“He came through the door and said I can’t deal with this hot weather,” Adnan Zafar, Wasim’s cousin, told the BBC. “He asked for a glass of water. Soon after he finished it, he collapsed.”\n\nBy the time Wasim’s family got him to hospital, the medics said he had already died of a suspected heart attack.\n\nHe had an existing heart condition, Adnan says, but he hadn’t suffered in the heat before.\n\nKarachi’s struggle to cope with the high temperatures is, some fear, being made worse by regular power cuts which cut off the fans and air conditioning many rely on to keep cool.\n\nMuhammad Amin was among those who was suffering with loadshedding - where the electricity supply was cut off; a common practice across Pakistan by the electricity board to try to preserve supply.\n\nHis relative says their flat experienced consistent constant power cuts.\n\nAccording to his family, Muhammad who was in his 40s suddenly became sick, then died.\n\nCause of death has not been established, but his family suspect it was heat-related.\n\nAccording to Dawn newspaper, almost 30 people have been found dead by emergency services on the city’s streets.\n\nMany are suspected drug addicts, Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed told the newspaper.

        "I have £2.6m blood and it has 'cured' my haemophilia\n\n27 June 2024 By James Gallagher , @JamesTGallagher, Health and science correspondent Share\n\nBBC Elliott Collins spent 29 years needing regular injections to help clot his blood, now he feels cured\n\nA transformational gene therapy that treats the bleeding disorder haemophilia B is being made available on the NHS. Elliott Collins was one of the first to get the treatment when he took part in the trials that proved it worked. He says he \"feels cured\" and the gene therapy has given him a \"new lease of life\". The treatment is one of the world's most expensive, with an official cost of £2.6m.\n\nWhen you cut yourself, the body senses the injury and activates a series of clotting proteins in the bloodstream. This makes the blood sticky at the site of the wound and then seals it with a clot. But from the day he was born, Elliott was unable to make enough clotting factor IX (nine). Without this crucial clotting component, bleeds are bigger and longer. Bleeds also happen spontaneously inside joints - such as the knee or elbow - causing long-term damage. Elliott, who is 34 and from Colchester, rebelled against his diagnosis as a child by sneakily playing rugby or skateboarding. But any injury risked a damaging bleed, like when he was tackled playing football. \"I got studs right across the shin and that came up like a cartoon, like Tom and Jerry,\" he said. Elliott needed injections of factor IX twice a week - and more if he was injured - for 29 years. \"I would have to think about it all the time,\" he said.\n\nElliott Collins Elliott Collins is one of a handful of people to have been treated with the gene therapy during the clinical trials\n\nBut he took part in trials of the gene therapy when it was still just an experimental idea in 2019. Since then, he has not needed any factor IX injections and says it has transformed his life. He told me: \"I don't think you can go through something like that for 29 years, for it to completely disappear and not change someone mentally and physically. \"I feel cured.\" He knew it was working when he clattered his knee into a cupboard. He whacked it hard enough to balloon up and need a factor IX injection, but instead he watched as only a small mark appeared. \"That solidified [the realisation] this is real, this is working and I can relax a bit.\" Tests showed that levels of factor IX in Elliott's blood had gone from nothing to 60% of normal.\n\nHow it works\n\nGetty Images The gene therapy uses a virus to \"infect\" Elliott's liver with DNA containing the ability to make factor IX\n\nElliot was born with a mutation in his DNA - his genetic code - that meant his body's instructions for making factor IX were faulty. So doctors gave him engineered viruses that contained copies of the fully functional factor IX instructions. The viruses act like a fleet of microscopic postmen, delivering those blueprints to the liver. The organ is then able to manufacture the clotting protein. It was a one-off infusion, lasting about an hour, that Elliott is benefiting from five years later. Not everybody will have as good a response as Elliott. In trials on 54 men, two still needed to take factor IX injections. And nobody knows how long it will last - some trials have suggested more than a decade. \"I'm very aware of the fact that this is new, I'm almost preparing myself for it to potentially wear off to avoid any kind of major disappointment,\" Elliott says.\n\nHow can the NHS afford it?\n\nUncertainty over how long patients benefit makes it hard to know whether the gene therapy is worth the money. Normal clotting factor injections cost between £150,000 and £200,000 per patient per year for life. But the gene therapy - branded Hemgenix - has an official list price of £2.6m. Elliott says it's \"wild to think that’s how much it costs\" and now he had multi-million pound blood he should \"probably get life insurance\". The treatment is being made available through a deal between the company CSL Behring, NHS England and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, the body that rules on cost-effectiveness. I have pressed all the parties involved for details of the deal, but it is bound up in confidentiality agreements. As I understand it, the NHS will track how much patients benefit for more than a decade and that will dictate how much CSL Behring are paid. If factor IX levels dip earlier than expected, then the NHS will pay less. It is essentially performance-related pay for drugs and it is the first such deal the NHS has agreed. The therapy will be available immediately at eight centres - Oxford, Manchester, Leeds, Bristol, Birmingham, Cambridge and two in London. Around 2,000 people in the UK have haemophilia B and the NHS anticipates treating 250 of them. Not everyone will be suitable for the gene therapy as some are too young or have other health conditions that rule them out. Prof Sir Stephen Powis, the NHS national medical director, said the \"transformative\" gene therapy could be \"truly life-changing\" and had been secured \"at an affordable price\".\n\n'Real milestone'\n\nHaemophilia runs in families. Elliott's younger brother was six days old when he died of a brain bleed. His great-uncle died from the condition at the age of 14. Those with haemophilia, mostly but not exclusively men, pass the affected genes onto their daughters who become carriers. This therapy will not change that genetic inheritance so it is not considered a true \"cure\". But Kate Burt, chief executive of the Haemophilia Society, said it was a \"real milestone\". \"It is life-transforming at its most effective, it can last for decades and put the bleeding disorder into complete remission.\" Similar gene therapies are being developed for haemophilia A, which is more common and affects nearly 9,000 people in the UK.

        "New mpox strain in DR Congo 'most dangerous yet'\n\n26 June 2024 By Philippa Roxby , Health reporter Share\n\nReuters Mpox, formerly called monkeypox, is a viral infection and can be deadly\n\nA new strain of the mpox virus spreading quickly along the eastern border of Democratic Republic of Congo is \"incredibly worrying\", say health officials monitoring its spread. The virus, which can cause lesions across the whole body, is making some people very ill and can be deadly. The current outbreak has been driven by sexual transmission but there is evidence this strain can also be passed on through close skin-to-skin contact. Global health experts say the new variant risks cross-border and international spread of the virus, with one calling it the \"most dangerous strain yet\". A worldwide epidemic of mpox in 2022 was brought under control by vaccinating vulnerable groups. But there is poor access to vaccines and treatments in DR Congo and local health officials are warning the virus could reach other countries. \"The disease can go through airports. A person with lesions can go through borders because there are no controls,\" said Leandre Murhula Masirika, at the health department in South Kivu province - one of the worst affected areas in DR Congo. \"I'm very afraid it's going to cause more damage.\"\n\n'Risk of spread'\n\nCases of mpox, formerly called monkeypox, have been on the rise in the African country for decades. Official figures from the World Health Organization (WHO) show there have been nearly 8,000 cases this year in DR Congo, including 384 deaths - almost half of these among children under 15. An outbreak in South Kivu province, near the border with Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda, is causing particular concern. Lab testing of virus samples from the area recently found the new mpox strain, which contains mutations that appear to help it circulate among humans. In the mining town of Kamituga, where the strain is thought to have originated among sex workers in September 2023, cases are rising. Those now being infected include schoolchildren, healthcare workers treating mpox patients and entire households. The new strain has been detected in several cities along the border, including Goma, which borders Rwanda. The WHO said it represented \"a renewed risk of cross-border and international spread which may potentially lead to an increased risk of severe illness\".\n\nReuters A six-year-old girl with mpox in an outbreak in DR Congo in 2022\n\nScientists briefing journalists about the current outbreak said they feared the new strain was being spread more easily, causing more serious disease and more deaths in children and adults. There is also concern over the risk of asymptomatic spread between people who do not have symptoms and are unaware they have the virus. The current case figures are \"the tip of the iceberg\", said Prof Trudie Lang, professor of global health research at the University of Oxford. \"It's definitely the most dangerous strain yet. \"We don’t know how many non-severe cases are hidden.\" It is also not clear how fast the new strain spreads or whether current vaccines will protect against it. Trials will be needed to work this out, which will take time. The global outbreak of mpox that spread across Europe and America in 2022 was sexually transmitted and driven by men who have sex with men. It was caused by the Clade II mpox virus. The new strain is from the more deadly Clade I but is distinct from other outbreaks which have previously affected the region. It can also be spread through non-sexual contact, which makes it more dangerous. Many children have been infected, including newborn babies during pregnancy. There have been reports of a small number of infected pregnant women miscarrying their babies. And some patients have been left with long-term complications with their eyes, skin and genitals. One healthcare worker looking after an infected patient is reported to have lost her sight after becoming infected herself. In cases in DR Congo to date, the new strain has a mortality rate of 4% in adults and 10% in children.\n\nPoor access to vaccines",
        "Faces made of living skin make robots smile\n\n25 June 2024 By Michelle Roberts , Digital health editor, BBC News Share\n\n©2024 Takeuchi et al. CC-BY-ND Taking inspiration from human skin ligaments, the prototype face can be made to smile\n\nJapanese scientists have found a way to attach living skin to robot faces, for more realistic smiles and other facial expressions. The breakthrough came from copying tissue structures in people, according to the team at Tokyo University. The prototype may appear more Haribo than human-like. But the researchers say it paves the way to making convincingly realistic, moving humanoids with self-healing skin that will not easily rip or tear.\n\n©2024 Takeuchi et al. CC-BY-ND Scientists say their new method can work on complex, curved and even moving surfaces\n\nThe artificial skin is made in the lab, using living cells. Not only is it soft, like real skin but it can repair itself if cut, the scientists say. Past attempts to attach it proved difficult, though. The team tried using mini hooks as anchors - but those damaged the skin as the robot moved. In people, the skin is tethered to underlying structures by ligaments - tiny ropes of flexible collagen and elastin. To recreate that, the researchers drilled lots of little holes into the robot and applied a gel containing collagen, and then the layer of artificial skin on top. The gel plugs the holes and tethers the skin to the robot.\n\nPlastic surgery",
        "What is mpox and how is it spread?\n\n26 June 2024 Share\n\nReuters Outbreaks in DR Congo have affected children as well as adults\n\nA new strain of the mpox virus is spreading quickly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and experts say it is the most dangerous variant they have seen. Mpox, which used to be called monkeypox, is endemic in parts of west and central Africa and cases have been on the rise on the continent for decades. In 2022, a worldwide epidemic of mpox affected Europe, Australia, the US and many other countries.\n\nHow common is mpox?\n\nMpox disease is caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe. The virus was originally transmitted from animals to humans, and is more common in countries close to tropical rainforests. In these regions, there are thousands of cases and hundreds of deaths from the disease every year - with children under the age of 15 worst affected. There are two main strains of the virus known to exist. The milder one caused a global outbreak in 2022 which spread to nearly 100 countries that do not usually see the virus. The second, more deadly strain is endemic in central Africa - it is behind the new recently discovered strain in DR Congo. The two types carry different risks of disease and mortality.\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nGetty Images Mpox, or monkeypox, is spread through close contact with infected people\n\nInitial symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain and aching muscles. Once the fever breaks, a rash can develop, often beginning on the face then spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The rash, which can be extremely itchy or painful, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The lesions can cause scarring. The infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days. Serious cases can see lesions attack the whole of the body, and especially the mouth, eyes and genitals.\n\nHow is it spread?\n\nMpox spreads from person to person through close contact with someone who is infected - including through sex, skin-to-skin contact and talking or breathing close to another person. The virus can enter the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract or through the eyes, nose or mouth. It can also be spread through touching objects which have been contaminated by the virus, such as bedding, clothing and towels. Close contact with infected animals, such as monkeys, rats and squirrels, is another route. During the global outbreak in 2022, the virus spread mostly through sexual contact. The current DR Congo outbreak is being driven by sexual contact, but has also been found in other communities.\n\nWho is most at risk?\n\nGetty Images There are vaccines which protect against severe mpox\n\nMost cases are often found in people who are sexually active and men who have sex with men. People with several partners or new sexual partners can be most at risk. But anyone who has close contact with someone with symptoms can catch the virus, including health workers and family members. Advice is to avoid close contact with anyone with mpox and clean your hands with soap and water if the virus is in your community. Those who have mpox should isolate from others until all their lesions have disappeared.

In my 13 years of working here, I don’t remember signing a death certificate for heat stroke. This year, I’ve signed several,” says Ajay Chauhan of the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital (RMLH). Delhi has been reeling under a prolonged heatwave, with daily temperatures crossing 40C (104F) since May, peaking at nearly 50C. Humidity and hot winds exacerbate the heat, compounded by water shortages and power outages due to soaring demand. And people are dying from the heat, with media reports suggesting at least 20 fatalities due to heat-related illnesses. A heat stroke, the most severe heat illness, is identified by three key signs: exposure to high heat and humidity, a core body temperature of 40.5C (105F) or higher, and mental changes like mild confusion or impaired consciousness. Heat stroke is also a silent killer, and victims can begin to fall ill hours after exposure to sun. India's National Centre for Disease Control calls heat strokes a \"life-threatening\" condition with a mortality rate of 40-64%. Since Dr Chauhan's hospital in Delhi opened a heat stroke clinic in late May, seven people have died of heat stroke and more than 40 have been treated for heat-related ailments.\n\nAFP Ajay Chauhan, head of the Delhi heat stroke clinic, says he has never seen so many patients\n\nThe majority were men working outdoors and in small, unregulated factories with poor conditions, enduring extreme heat exposure. To be sure, the heatwave is not restricted to Delhi: dozens have died from heat-related illnesses since March, with more than 50 deaths in just three days in early June in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Odisha. At the RMLH clinic, possibly the first of its kind in India, the effort to save heat stroke patients underscores the challenge posed by rapid climate and health emergencies. A few days ago, a man was wheeled in with body temperatures soaring to 42C (107.7F). A body’s normal core temperature is 37-38C. He was suffering from a heat stroke. At this temperature, a human body begins to shut down, cells deteriorate, and there’s a risk of organ failure. Sweating ceases as blood flow to the skin stops, leaving it cold and clammy. At the clinic, doctors dunked the patient into the icy waters of a 250-litre ceramic tub where the temperature ranges from 0 to 5C. (The clinic is equipped with two ceramic tubs, a 200kg ice-making machine, rectal thermometers, ice boxes and inflatable tubs.) The patient took about 25 minutes to cool down and begin recovering before he was moved to the ward for further treatment.\n\nReuters A patient suffering from heat exhaustion being wheeled into a hospital in Ahmedabad\n\n“Early cooling saves lives. Every second counts,” says Dr Chauhan. A delay can either prove to be fatal or leave the patient bleeding, or with damaged kidneys and liver. It is not difficult to fall ill in Delhi. Life is tough. A third of residents live in substandard and congested housing. The city’s 6,400-odd slums, home to more than a million households, lack adequate cooling and face seasonal livelihood crises. Men fall ill working outdoors; women fall sick after spending extended periods in kitchen settings with traditional stoves. Green spaces are scarce. In the peak of summer, the city turns into a scorching furnace, trapped between the blazing heat from above and the searing ground below. Anjana Kumari, the wife of a daily wage worker admitted at RHML with heat stroke, told The Indian Express that their slum hutment's only fan wasn’t working due to a power cut. Her husband, exhausted from working all day on Monday, couldn't sleep and later suffered seizures, vomiting, and diarrhoea. She rushed him to the hospital at night. “Doctors have told me he won't be able to walk for some time and need a lot of care,” Ms Kumari said. Those who work outdoors suffer the most. A large majority of respondents in a new Greenpeace survey on how heat impacts street vendors in Delhi reported health issues due to hot weather. Irritability was the most common (73.44%), followed by headaches, dehydration, sunburn, fatigue and muscle cramps. Most faced challenges accessing medical care due to lack of money.\n\nAFP At the Delhi heat stroke clinic, patients are dunked into ceramic tubs of icy water\n\n“The heat increases every day. We are living under the open sky. What resources can I gather? If possible, there should be some trees and plants nearby, so that fresh air keeps blowing and the body gets some relief,” Guddi, a sugarcane juice vendor who operates a manual crusher, told Greenpeace. “After being exposed to the heat of the sun all day, I don’t feel like eating dinner at night. All I can think about is stretching my legs and going to sleep,” she said. And all over India, people are falling sick due to the heat. A new nationwide survey by Centre for Rapid Insights (CRI) offers some startling insights into how heatwaves hurt people and cripple productivity. It showed that 45% of the households contacted reported at least one member getting sick from the heat last month. Among those affected, over 67% had household members sick for more than five days. This impact was particularly severe among the poorest. Specifically 32.5% of households with motorcycles and 28.2% with no vehicles had members ill for over five days; the figure was lower at 21.8% for households with cars.\n\nGetty Images There are more than 200,000 homeless people in Delhi, many of whom live in congested shelters in the sweltering heat",

The 38-year-old, who ran under the pseudonym Neville because he wanted to remain anonymous, raised more than £8,500 for cancer research. Neville was also joined by co-runners each day, all of whom had been affected by cancer in some way. Describing the challenge as a \"bit spicy\", Neville said it was \"nothing compared to what people go through with cancer\".\n\nThe challenge involved running the same number of miles each day commensurate with the calendar date. He ran one mile on 1 June, two miles on 2 June, increasing to 30 miles on 30 June.\n\nSupplied The runner said the challenge had been hard, but nothing compared to what people with cancer go through\n\nNeville, who also ran the final mile of each day while carrying the Cancer Research UK flag, wearing springy eye glasses, and shouting \"just one more mile\", was joined by host of co-runners. These included a man who is undergoing treatment for throat cancer and is fed though a tube, a cancer nurse who travelled three hours to take part and people running in memory of a loved one. \"Nearly all of them pushed themselves several miles beyond any distance they had previously run, all because they believed in the work that Cancer Research UK do,\" he said. \"Each had their own motivation for getting involved; stories of beating the odds, stories of loss, stories of ongoing battles,\" he added.\n\n'Pretty tired'\n\nNeville said he was the antipode of the type of person who you might expect to take on such a challenge, adding that the final week had been especially hard due to the heat and the distance. \"But in the grand scheme of things, this was about raising money for cancer research, so tiredness and blisters are nothing compared to what people go through with cancer,\" he said. To date, including gift aid, the charity effort has raised more than £8,500. The runner said donations were still coming in and he hoped \"it might just creep over the £10,000 line\". People could also read the personal stories of those who took part on Neville's Instagram page, he said. He added that the character of Neville would now \"quietly slip away\" after being heard quoting Forrest Gump. \"I'm pretty tired.

        "Hospital to reconsider plans to move services\n\n3 hours ago By Ivan Morris Poxton , Local Democracy Reporting Service Share\n\nGoogle Scunthorpe General Hospital could retain some emergency services and children's treatments\n\nPlans to move emergency care and some children's services from Scunthorpe General Hospital are to be reconsidered. Originally, overnight care, where children require a more than 24 hours stay in hospital, was to be moved to Grimsby's Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital. Following a consultation, it is proposed that paediatric services will remain at both hospitals. Plans to move overnight emergency surgery to Grimsby are also under review, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\n\nEmergency surgery will now be shared across hospitals in northern Lincolnshire and Hull, depending on the treatment required. Plans for the trauma unit and individuals with heart, lung or stomach conditions who require a longer stay in hospital will be moved to Grimsby. If the NHS Humber and North Yorkshire Integrated Care Board (ICB) agrees to the revised proposals, it is anticipated around seven patients a day would be transferred from Scunthorpe to Grimsby. The local NHS says the proposed changes will help deliver “seven-day consultant-led care” across specialist services, improve the quality of care that patients receive, and reduce length of hospital stays. North Lincolnshire Council had threatened to seek a judicial review over the plans to move the trauma unit and out-of-hours emergency surgery.\n\nGoogle Some services will be moved to Grimsby's Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital",

The second \"in your shoes\" feedback is set to be held on 24 July from 11:00 to 13:00 BST at Hospice Isle of Man. A a similar event took place in March to engage with carers leading to the creation of action points being drawn up. Experience and engagement lead Karen Maddox said the experiences of patients and their carers was an area identified by the Manx Care Advice and Liaison Service (MCALS) as a \"pressure point\".\n\n'Influence local care'\n\nMs Maddox said since the first event a collaborative group comprising Manx Care and third sector representatives had begun meeting monthly to draw up action points identified by carers, and implement them. Changes that the health provider will make over the next six months to two years include the expansion of coffee mornings and walking groups, more detailed information packs, improved respite services, and the creation of quiet areas for patients with disease. There are 20 spaces available at the event, which can be booked by contacting MCALS, with the possibility of a third in future if felt necessary. Ms Maddox said the health care provider was \"really keen\" to listen to more experiences and the feedback session was \"another genuine opportunity for carers to share their stories and to influence the future of local care\". The additional feedback will be used to expand Manx Care's action plan to improve its services. While it would feed into the carers strategy that was recently approved in Tynwald, it was a piece of work designed to tackle the needs of a more specific group of people, Ms Maddox added.",
        "'Fake laughing could change your life'\n\n4 hours ago By Rachel Candlin , BBC News, West of England Share\n\nClive St James Clive St James and his wife, Jackie, run regular free laughter yoga classes\n\nThe old adage that \"laughter is the best medicine\" has become the mantra of a yoga teacher who believes even fake chuckles could \"change your life\". Clive St James, from Bath, is a laughter yoga leader, who discovered at a young age that doing comedy impersonations helped his mother's chronic depression. Laughter releases endorphins, known as \"feel-good hormones\" and reduces stress hormones, he said. \"It supercharges you. It's about having fun while you're exercising. Once you gain the basic skills, you can change someone's life,\" said Mr St James.\n\n\"Of course, it's yoga, so we do all the stretching exercises. \"We know that's good for you and makes us stronger, more flexible but we also want to become advanced breathers. \"We only laugh on the out breath, so this is a good way of getting rid of all the stale air at the bottom of your lungs,\" he told BBC Bristol\n\nFeel-good hormones\n\nThough laughing therapy has been used for decades, laughing yoga was started by Dr Madan Kataria, a doctor in Mumbai, India, in 1995. After a number of trials, he discovered that our brains are unable to tell the difference between fake or real laughs. \"The brain doesn't know the difference between laughing for real, or pretend laughing,\" said Mr St James. \"If someone tells you a joke, you have to decide if it's funny, or if you've heard it before, or if it's going to upset you. \"But if you laugh for no reason, you still get your daily dose of those lovely endorphins,\" he added.\n\nClive St James There are now more than 5,000 laughter yoga classes worldwide\n\nIn 2023, a study presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress and endorsed by the British Heart Foundation (BHF), found that laughter therapy led to improvements in the heart and circulation. There are now more than 5,000 laughter yoga clubs worldwide. According to the BHF, some doctors in Bristol offer laughter yoga to help improve their patients' wellbeing.\n\nMr St James has first-hand experience of the beneficial power of laughter, after he started doing impersonations of the late comedian, Tommy Cooper, as a child to help with his mother's chronic depression. \"I would put a flower pot on my head - Tommy Cooper habitually wore a red fez when performing - and that made her smile. \"It would take her out of this dark space,\" he said.\n\nMr St James was also crowned the Guinness World Record's fastest comedian for the last eight years. This involves getting audiences to laugh within moments of the comedian arriving on stage. He now runs regular laughter yoga workshops with his wife, Jackie.

        "New health minister brands NHS 'broken' ahead of pay talks\n\n10 hours ago By Maria Zaccaro , BBC News Share\n\nPA Media\n\nThe new Health Secretary Wes Streeting has branded the NHS \"broken\" in his first day in the job, as he says discussions with junior doctors will begin next week. The Ilford North MP warned the health service is \"going through the biggest crisis in its history\", and it cannot be fixed overnight. Mr Streeting said he spoke with the British Medical Association (BMA) on Friday ahead of starting fresh talks in an attempt to end a long-running pay dispute. The BMA described the call as “positive”. It has repeatedly asked for a 35% rise, to make up for what it says are 15 years of below-inflation pay rises.\n\nMr Streeting said Labour, which is in power for the first time in 14 years, had promised to begin negotiations as a matter of urgency \"and that is what we are doing\". \"From today, the policy of this department is that the NHS is broken,\" he said. His comments came shortly after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer appointed Labour MPs to key cabinet positions as the party secured a landslide election victory.\n\nEPA\n\nMr Streeting, who held his seat by a 528-vote margin, said the new government would be \"honest\" about the challenges it faced. He added: \"When we said that patients are being failed on a daily basis, it wasn't political rhetoric, but the daily reality faced by millions. \"Previous governments have not been willing to admit these simple facts. But in order to cure an illness, you must first diagnose it.\"\n\nIn its manifesto, Labour promised to deliver an extra 40,000 operations, scans and appointments a week in England - two million a year - by introducing more weekend services, as well as turning to the private sector.

        "Scottish government advised to halt puberty blockers\n\n20 hours ago By Jonathan Geddes , BBC Scotland News Share\n\nPA Media\n\nThe Scottish government has been advised to formally pause puberty blockers until further research has been carried out. The advice is one of several recommendations from a team looking into how the Cass review on gender services for children and young people could be applied in Scotland. Other suggestions include ensuring a lead senior clinician takes overall responsibility for each young person’s care and that work on a regional service for children should begin immediately. Neil Gray, the Scottish health secretary, said the report's findings would now be considered and used in \"reforming and improving\" gender healthcare across the country. The Cass review was published in April by paediatrician Dr Hilary Cass, and called for gender services for young people to match the standards of other NHS care. A number of conclusions - including saying medical justification for treatments like puberty blockers was \"remarkably weak\" - proved politically contentious, with Dr Cass saying some critics were spreading misinformation about her work.\n\nPro-trans protestors at the Sandyford Clinic in Glasgow earlier this year\n\nAt the time of publication it was criticised by the Scottish Greens, who at that stage were part of the Scottish government. Public Health Minister Jenni Minto told MSPs on 23 April that although the Cass review looked at services provided by NHS England, the findings would also be carefully considered in Scotland. Glasgow's Sandyford Clinic took the decision to stop new patients aged 16 or 17 receiving other hormone treatments until they were 18, a decision that was criticised by the charity Scottish Trans. The new findings suggest this decision - taken by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde - should became formal government policy in the future. The report stated: \"The use of puberty-supressing hormones – commonly referred to as puberty blockers – should be paused until further clinical trials can be undertaken. \"NHS Scotland will continue to engage in the forthcoming UK study.\"\n\nA 'cowardly attempt'\n\nThe Scottish government was criticised for releasing its response on the day after the general election. Scottish Conservative deputy leader Meghan Gallacher described the move as a \"cowardly attempt to sneak this out when everyone’s gaze is elsewhere\". She added that it was \"not good enough\" that MSPs would have to wait weeks before questioning the government. The findings - carried out by a multi-disciplinary team commissioned by the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland - also found that each care plan should include \"a full assessment of the child’s needs, both psychological and physical.\" Professor Graham Ellis, Scotland's Deputy Chief Medical Officer said the team had examined the Cass report from a \"clinical perspective\" while remembering that all children should grow up \"safe, respected and supported.\" He added: “At the heart of this question are children and young people in distress, and our ambition must remain focused on meeting their needs with holistic, person-centred care as close to home as practical. “The Cass Review identified the need to ensure that gender identity services for young people are more closely aligned with other areas of clinical practice, and that responsibility for the full range of services required should extend beyond specialist services.\"\n\nQuestioning identity",

According to a Public Health Scotland report, 443 people with the virus were in hospital having been admitted because of acute symptoms in the week ending 30 June. This was a slight increase on the previous week's 418 patients, but numbers have been rising rapidly throughout June and have exceeded the winter peak of 388.

Data for Covid is no longer collected in the way it was during the height of the pandemic as far less testing takes place now.

Sarah Frith, from Sheffield, was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) aged 48 in 2022 and was told she also had MND the following year. According to the MND Association, up to 15% of people originally diagnosed with FTD go on to develop MND. Mr Heslop said the stress of caring for someone that suffers from both conditions has put a “huge strain on the family”.\n\nMr Heslop said the couple, who have been together for 23 years and have two children, both lost their jobs in 2019 and initially thought his partner's behavioural changes were due to stress. However, when Ms Frith started a new job working from home towards the end of 2020 he saw she was struggling with tasks she would usually have managed. Following a GP visit in 2021, Ms Frith was diagnosed with stress and anxiety and signed off work, but a follow-up scan revealed deterioration in the front of her brain. After further scans and tests the following year, Ms Frith was formally diagnosed with FTD.\n\nFamily handout Mr Heslop says his partner had now lost about 75% of her speech\n\nMs Frith's talking started to change in 2023, he said, and she eventually lost about 75% of her speech. She also developed issues with eating and started to struggle swallowing her food. Tests in December 2023 revealed she had MND, with the further diagnosis adding “extra complexities” to her care, Mr Heslop said. While some patients are affected in their legs and require a wheelchair, Ms Frith has issues with her arms and throat. “She can’t grip a glass any more,\" said Mr Heslop. \"She has to have special food so she doesn’t choke.” Listen: Sheffield mother diagnosed with dementia and MND\n\nThe treatment for MND and dementia patients \"doesn't always fit together\", Mr Heslop said. He continued: “It's impossible - I have to make choices about her end-of-life care, she can’t make them because she has dementia and doesn’t understand it.” MND patients sometimes go through the process of using a feeding tube, but Mr Heslop said it was not an option for them. “It’s not appropriate with Sarah’s dementia, she doesn’t realise what it’s there for and will probably try and pull it out and reject it,” he said.\n\nMental health toll",
        "Maternity staff faced racism from colleagues - CQC\n\n1 day ago By Matt Precey , BBC News, Bedfordshire Share\n\nGetty Maternity services at the Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust have been downgraded to 'inadequate'\n\nMaternity staff at an NHS trust faced racism from their own colleagues, a Care Quality Commission (CQC) report said. The problem was identified at both the Luton and Dunstable (L&D) and Bedford hospitals during an inspection. Some ethnic minority overseas staff told the CQC discrimination had become \"normalised\". The Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said it was addressing these issues.\n\nThe regulator was alerted to concerns around the safety, culture, and management of the service by whistleblowers. On the first day of the inspection, last November, the Luton and Dunstable Hospital's maternity unit was at full capacity and the trust had to divert new arrivals. Low staffing levels also meant women and babies were not always kept safe. The trust was issued with a warning to improve and maternity services at both hospitals have now both been rated as 'inadequate'.\n\nAt the L&D some staff told the inspectors they did not feel able to report instances of racism. Management acknowledged some parts of the unit had a \"challenging culture\". There were concerns racist incidents being reported to the trust would not be investigated in line with the trust’s values. At Bedford similar issues were reported.\n\nPA Images Some staff at the trust felt they could not speak out about the racism they had experienced\n\n'Undermined by racism'\n\nAccording to trust data, there were also disparities in pay among staff of different ethnicities. At the L&D, white staff were almost twice as likely to be appointed to jobs after being shortlisted. The hospital's board was also among the worst in the country for ethnic minority representation.\n\nStuart Dunn, CQC deputy director of operations in the East of England, said: “We were concerned to find low staffing for midwives was still a significant risk to the safety of women using these services and their babies despite us telling the trust they needed to address this previously.\" He said the trust had recruited midwives from abroad to help tackle this but this was \"being undermined by racism against staff, by their own colleagues, and a lack of support from leaders\". He continued: “Some international midwives told us they often felt excluded, and that it was normalised for colleagues from ethnic minorities to experience discrimination from colleagues\". In the trust’s 2022 staff survey, a third of all midwives reported experiencing at least one incident of bullying or harassment from colleagues, Mr Dunn said.\n\nVacancy rate\n\nIn response, the chief executive of Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, David Carter, said: \"As a trust committed to delivering excellent care, the CQC feedback was disappointing for us to hear but we are focussing our effort on ensuring that our maternity services consistently meets the standards of care we aspire to give. “We were disappointed to hear that our international midwives reported issues of discrimination. Any act of discrimination or racism is unacceptable and the trust is committed to ensuring any issues are addressed\". Mr Carter added that the vacancy rate for registered midwives had been reduced to 6.6% on the L&D site, while Bedford was now fully staffed.\n\nWhile maternity services are now rated ‘inadequate’ the overall rating of the Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust remained ‘good’. The trust said it had now began a culture and development programme for staff to provide training on \"cultural competency, unconscious bias, and anti-racism practices\".",

        "NI records sharp rise in measles cases\n\n2 days ago Share\n\nGetty Images A skin rash is a common symptom of measles, and appears after a few days of cold-like symptoms\n\nThere have been 11 cases of measles recorded in Northern Ireland in the past 6 months. In the Republic of Ireland 68 cases were logged within the same time frame. Measles is highly infectious and is caused by a virus that can easily spread between unvaccinated people. In February, Northern Ireland reported its first case of the disease since 2017. It led to the the Public Health Agency (PHA) launching a mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine catch-up campaign in an effort to prevent the spread of the disease. The PHA said there had been a decline in vaccine uptake in recent years with Northern Ireland falling behind the recommended 95% vaccination rate. That is the level that has been recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The number of people reporting cases of the disease increased in February, according to figures released by the PHA. Of the 68 confirmed cases in the Republic of Ireland, 18 were in children under 5-years-old. An additional 17 cases are currently under investigation for measles. There have been 10 measles outbreaks in the Republic of Ireland in 2024, according to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC).\n\nWhat are the symptoms of measles?\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious disease which is spread by coughs and sneezes. Common symptoms include: high fever\n\nsore, red and watery eyes\n\ncoughing\n\nsneezing Small white spots may appear inside the mouth. A blotchy red or brown rash usually appears after a few days, typically on the face and behind the ears, before spreading to the rest of the body. It can be harder to see on brown and black skin. Measles normally clears up within seven to 10 days. However, it can lead to pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and seizures. In rare cases it can lead to death. A list of symptoms and advice on what to do if you think you have measles is available on the NHS website.\n\nGetty Images Measles is highly infectious and can spread easily between unvaccinated people\n\nWhat is the MMR vaccination?\n\nThe MMR vaccine gives lifelong protection against measles. The first MMR dose is usually given when a child is 12 months old, while the second is administered at about three years and four months. However, it can be given at any age via a GP. Most MMR side-effects are mild. Babies and young children may develop a high temperature for up to 72 hours.\n\nPHA Louise Flanagan is a consultant in public health at the PHA\n\nLouise Flanagan, Consultant in Public Health at the PHA, said the MMR vaccine is important \"in helping to protect your children and preventing against this highly infectious and serious disease\". In a statement, she said that while the disease can be \"unpleasant\", it usually improves within a week without causing any further problems, however for some it can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications. Ms Flanagan says the introduction of the MMR vaccine meant cases in Northern Ireland were rare until recently.\n\nWhat should I do if I get measles?",
        "'Aggressive' nurse struck off after 'serious' incident\n\n2 days ago By Harriet Robinson , BBC News, Somerset Share\n\nGoogle The nurse was working at a home caring for people with dementia\n\nAn \"aggressive\" nurse has been struck off after threatening to hit an elderly resident and \"potentially putting other patients at risk\". Abdikadir Hassan Mohamed was initially suspended after the incident at Bath's Culverhayes Nursing Home, a report by Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) stated. However, he refused to engage with proceedings, and has since been sacked. The NMC ruled because of Mr Mohamed’s \"failure to demonstrate safe practice and insight into his serious misconduct\" he could not remain on the NMC Register.\n\nThe report explained that on 12 April 2021, Mr Mohamed shouted at a resident, named Resident B, repeatedly telling him to go to his room. The nurse also \"got very close\" to him, said that he would hit him and shouted \"if you are a resident then behave as a resident\". He then invited Resident B to hit him. Staff witnessed him acting in an \"aggressive, threatening and demeaning manner\", and this caused distress to the nearby residents, the report stated. His actions were \"unprofessional and caused escalation of an incident which had the potential to put others at risk\", the report added. Mr Mohamed was suspended from practising as a nurse and has since not engaged with the proceedings into his actions.\n\nNo remorse\n\nThe report stated: \"The panel was of the view that if Mr Mohamed were to demonstrate full insight, genuine remorse and take steps to strengthen his practice then his misconduct would potentially be remediable.\" But the committee said the \"absence of any insight, remorse, lack of awareness\" has resulted in a striking-off order to \"adequately protect the public and serve the public interest\".",
        "Inquiry after butt lift patients are hospitalised\n\n2 days ago By Louise Parry , BBC News, Essex Share\n\nGetty Images BBL surgery has the highest death rate of all cosmetic procedures, according to the NHS\n\nA council is investigating after people ended up in hospital following Brazilian butt lift procedures. Brentwood Borough Council in Essex wants to hear from anyone in the area who has had the non-surgical work done. The procedure - also known as BBL or Liquid BBL - which uses a hyaluronic acid filler, is not illegal but is currently unregulated and can be fatal if not performed properly. The council said \"an individual and associated companies\" in Brentwood had been banned from carrying out BBL procedures until any risks had been \"controlled\".\n\nEnvironmental health officers were \"investigating cases of hospitalisation due to members of the public undergoing a non-surgical aesthetic procedure, commonly known as a Brazilian Butt Lift, BBL or Liquid BBL in Brentwood,\" the council said. The authority has not named the firms involved or revealed how many patients have been hospitalised.\n\nIt is working with other local authorities and industry experts after a flurry of cases raised concern, including reports of treatment being carried out in hotel rooms. A spokesperson from Brentwood Borough Council said: \"Individuals who have undergone these procedures have experienced excruciating pain, discomfort and infections, some of which have required medical interventions and hospitalisation.\" They urged anyone experiencing symptoms to \"seek medical assistance immediately\".\n\nWhat is a Brazilian butt lift?\n\nBrazilian butt lifts, or BBLs, are procedures designed to make buttocks bigger, more rounded or lifted. Those carrying out the lifts insert silicone-filled implants and/or inject fat transferred from other parts of the body. In 2019, a woman from Norfolk died at a private hospital in Istanbul while undergoing the procedure. The surgery, as with many cosmetic procedures, can be expensive, but liquid or non-surgical BBLs are a cheaper option. In that version, hyaluronic acid, which is used in dermal fillers, is injected to manipulate the size and/or shape of the area. But if not performed in a proper way, it can lead to serious health complications.\n\n'Proceed with caution'\n\nBrentwood Borough Council is urging people \"to undertake extensive research\" before opting for BBL. \"If the cost of the treatment is lower than the market average, proceed with caution as the practitioner may not be using the products advertised,\" a spokesperson said. \"Please be aware that non-surgical aesthetic procedures still require a sterile clinical environment, therefore procedures should be performed in appropriate treatment rooms. \"If you have concerns or doubts about the procedure, contact us.\"",

Views From Convalescent Hill is based in Felixstowe, which was a popular Victorian holiday destination. There is a temporary exhibition at the town's museum on Landguard Point, performance pieces and a collection of oral histories. Natalie Pace, director of Pier Projects Art Agency, said: \"It's about what those ideas mean to people today, what does convalescence look like, and what could it look like in the future?\"\n\nContributed A view of the spring water kiosk, the beach huts and prom in Felixstowe in 1901 where the Spa Pavilion now is (the pier had not been built yet either)\n\nAccording to Felixstowe Museum, the town rapidly expanded when the port opened in the 1880s and the railway brought visitors keen to experience a seaside holiday. However, before the tourism boom, the sea air and a seawater-swim brought people recovering from illness. Bev Boyce, from the Felixstowe Society, has recorded a conversation about the resort's health history. She said: \"There's a chap called Sir John Fludyers. In 1697, apparently he said 'sea bathing is good for ulcers, scabs, itching, leprosy, pains of the limbs and all inflammation'. \"So sea bathing was something that was really being pushed and promoted, and places like Felixstowe were part of that.\"\n\nJon Wright/BBC Elian Shipp, general manager of Landguard Fort and Felixstowe Museum, said collaborating with the project would hopefully bring in more visitors\n\nViews From Convalescent Hill uses community-led research to explore the heritage of wellbeing, rest and care in Felixstowe. Elian Shipp, general manager of Landguard Fort and Felixstowe Museum, said: \"It's lovely to display some of our items which have been in storage and show them off to people. \"It's wonderful to work with local collaborators to make something new and have a space to show something, which will hopefully bring more people to the museum.\" The exhibition will run 4 July until 3 November.\n\nThe project also incorporates a performance called All Ears: A Community Listening Station, by artist Dana Olărescu. Another creative piece is Rest Easy, from artist Elaine Aston. She has created a deckchair with cyanotype printed fabric, which will be accompanied by sounds of Felixstowe.\n\nViews From Convalescent Hill was initiated by Pier Projects Art Agency with freelance project manager Laura Davison. It has been funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund and East Suffolk District Council, with support from Suffolk Archives, Felixstowe Museum, Suffolk Libraries and Felixstowe Old People's Welfare Association.",
        "Do hospital masks mean Covid is making a comeback?\n\n2 days ago By Dr David Gregory Kumar , BBC Midlands Today Science Correspondent Share\n\nGetty Images Face mask rules have been reintroduced at acute hospitals in Worcestershire\n\nSome hospitals have reintroduced mask wearing after a spike in patients being admitted with Covid-19, so should we be worried the virus is making a comeback? Since Monday, patients, visitors and staff are required to wear masks in clinical areas at the Royal Stoke University Hospital and County Hospital in Stafford. In Worcestershire, the Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said the measure was necessary \"to protect patients, their loved ones and hospital staff from risk of infection\" . They are currently treating 65 patients with Covid-19, the highest number since December 2023. Patients are also in hospital for longer so that would indicate they are sicker too.\n\nIn Staffordshire, there are 108 patients with the virus. At Royal Stoke Hospital two wards are currently full with Covid patients. But it is difficult to tell if this is some sort of \"summer Covid wave\" because we are doing a lot less testing than we used to. Most of the testing these days is done of hospital patients when they are admitted and yes, we are seeing a bit of an uptick, indeed it might be higher than the numbers suggest as not all new patients are tested.\n\nPart of life\n\nBut let's put these new cases in context. With about 170 infected patients in the last few weeks in Staffordshire and Worcestershire that is a lot fewer than we saw at the height of the pandemic. At the end of 2021 going in to 2022, we saw a peak in England of nearly 300,000 new cases a day and there are no signs we are even remotely close to a return to those sort of numbers. As for what is driving this small rise in cases, well Covid-19 as a virus is constantly evolving and yes that means new variants. If you remember it was the Omicron variant that drove that huge peak of 300,000 cases. Currently, we are seeing a descendent of that Omicron variant, JN1, dominating things and in fact, there are even newer mutations of JN1, that we are keeping an eye on collectively, called FliRT. (Flirt is an acronym that's to do with the locations of the mutations on the virus, if you are wondering.) But, it is too early to tell if FliRT variants are driving this small increase in infection. The truth is Covid-19 is now part of life. We will all be infected and re-infected over and over again. For many of us, that is not likely to be a problem, but those that can, should keep getting boosted, and yes, in hospital mask wearing is something we might see more of now and again as infection rates peak.\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "'My life was transformed by tremors treatment'\n\n2 days ago By Mark Norman , BBC South East Health Correspondent Share\n\nBBC/Mark Norman A neurological condition left Mary Hapgood struggling to eat, drink or socialise\n\nA Surrey woman who underwent ultrasound treatment for a neurological condition that left her struggling to eat or drink has hailed the procedure as \"magic\". Mary Hapgood, 72, from Cobham, Surrey, said her life had been \"completely transformed\" after doctors used sound waves to operate deep inside her brain. It comes as the neurosurgeon who carried out the non-invasive procedure for essential tremor (ET) called for the treatment to be rolled out to more NHS hospitals. An NHS spokesperson said two centres which had been commissioned to provide the treatment would \"provide sufficient capacity to meet national demand\".\n\nThe condition causes involuntary shaking of parts of the body and affects over a million people in the UK, but new research has highlighted an ongoing lack of understanding. The National Tremor Foundation said ET is considered one of the most common neurological movement disorders and is estimated to be eight to 10 times more prevalent than Parkinson's disease. But 70% of people living with ET hadn’t heard of it prior to diagnosis. It can sometimes be treated with drugs, which can have serious side effects, or with brain surgery, but this carries the risk of stroke and infection.\n\nBBC/Mark Norman Ms Hapgood is able to garden again after her treatment\n\nMs Hapgood lived with ET for 50 years and the condition slowly worsened over time. She says before the treatment \"it would have been very obvious\", with her hands \"flapping in the wind\" Eating and drinking became highly stressful because she could not get her hand to her face without shaking. But she was able to avoid the need for surgery with the MRI guided focused ultrasound treatment. As part of the treatment, MRI scanners are combined with powerful ultrasound waves which target very small parts of the brain.\n\nBBC/Mark Norman Professor Ludvic Zrinzo specialises in the surgical management of chronic neurological disease including tremor and Parkinson's disease\n\nProf Ludvic Zrinzo, at University College London Hospitals NHS Trust's National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, specialises in the surgical management of chronic neurological disease including tremor. \"I don't need to polish my knife or get my scalpel out... but I'm still going deep into the brain in a very precise way minimising the risks and improving patient outcomes,\" he said. The treatment is currently only available at two NHS centres, with patients waiting up to five years for focused ultrasound treatment on the NHS.\n\nBBC/Mark Norman Professor Ludvic Zrinzo says \"not enough\" NHS centres offer the treatment\n\n\"That is not enough, there are clearly too many patients and these centres are being overwhelmed,\" said Prof Zrinzo. \"We are very keen that the equipment we have at The National Hospital is commissioned by the NHS and we're working with commissioners for this to happen.\" Ms Hapgood echoed his call. \"I think there should be more MRI scanners. I am really supporting this having been through that awful time in my life when everything I did was shaking, it's really awful,\" she said. But the NHS spokesperson said it had commissioned the two specialised centres based on the estimated 50 to 150 patients a year who were eligible for the treatment. “Based on current referral numbers and activity within the service, the two centres will provide sufficient capacity to meet national demand and this will continue to be monitored,\" they added.",
        "Virtual appointments as trust reviews hospital parking\n\n2 days ago By Shannon Samecki , BBC News, Nottingham Share\n\nBBC Patients have said they have issues finding a car park space\n\nA hospital trust in Nottinghamshire has said it is offering more virtual appointments to patients while it reviews its car parking provision. Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said it had been treating \"growing numbers\" of people being treated at King's Mill Hospital, in Sutton-in-Ashfield, over the past year. Some patients attending appointments have complained about the lack of parking spaces, describing the situation as \"dire\" and \"absolutely manic\" at peak times. The trust said it was \"truly sorry\" for people's experiences, adding it was looking at ways to encourage more use of public transport.\n\nOne patient said they were waiting more than 45 minutes for a parking space\n\nAll public car parks at the hospital are barrier-controlled to provide safe parking and charge patients a fee for their stay. However, the barriers stopped working about six months ago, meaning people could park for free, and it was no longer controlled. The trust said: “We have seen growing numbers of people receiving treatment at our hospitals over the past year. \"To help manage this, we have been exploring ways to make the best possible use of our car parks, including by offering the option of virtual appointments to patients who don’t need to attend their appointments in-person. “While we know that public transport won’t be practical for everyone, [we have] worked with partners to install two new bus stops within the grounds of King’s Mill Hospital within the past year to make this a more convenient option, and [we are] also working with local providers to explore how we can encourage the use of public transport by both our staff and patients alike.”\n\n'Absolutely manic'\n\nHospital users expressed their frustration with the parking situation. King's Mill hospital is the closest for Mark Housley, 61, however, he says he does not even try the hospital car park and leaves his car at the supermarket across the road instead. The 61-year-old said: \"[At peak times] it's absolutely manic, and then later in the day it becomes a little more civilised.\" Ian Randall is a blue badge holder and said parking is \"dire\". He said he was unable to find a disabled parking space for his hospital appointment, ending up being 15 minutes late and having to park in a parent and child space. Mark Ball, 60, will park down the street and walk to the hospital when he has an appointment. He said: \"It's just too busy, there's no spaces, and it's too expensive, you don't know how long you're going to be here so it could cost a fortune.\" Follow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

        "Reformist Masoud Pezeshkian elected Iran's president\n\n7 hours ago By Kasra Naji , Special Correspondent, BBC Persian • Tom Bennett , BBC News Share\n\nReuters Former heart surgeon Dr Masoud Pezeshkian has been described as a wildcard candidate\n\nReformist Masoud Pezeshkian has been elected as Iran's new president, beating his hardline conservative rival Saeed Jalili. The vote was declared in Dr Pezeshkian's favour after he secured 53.3% of the more than 30 million votes counted. Mr Jalili polled at 44.3%. The run-off came after no candidate secured a majority in the first round of the election on 28 June, which saw a historically low voter turnout of 40%. The election was called after Iran’s previous president Ebrahim Raisi was killed in a helicopter crash in May, in which seven others also died.\n\nEven before the final results were declared by Iran's interior ministry, Dr Pezeshkian's supporters had taken to the streets in Tehran and a number of other cities to celebrate. Videos posted on social media showed mostly young people dancing and waving the signature green flag of his campaign, while passing cars sounded their horns. Dr Pezeshkian, a 71-year-old heart surgeon and member of the Iranian parliament, is critical of Iran’s notorious morality police and caused a stir after promising “unity and cohesion”, as well as an end to Iran's “isolation” from the world. He has also called for “constructive negotiations” with Western powers over a renewal of the faltering 2015 nuclear deal in which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear programme in return for an easing of Western sanctions. His rival, Saeed Jalili, favours the status quo. The former nuclear negotiator enjoys strong support amongst Iran’s most religious communities. Mr Jalili is known for his hardline anti-Western stance and opposition to restoring the nuclear deal, which he says crossed Iran’s “red lines\". Turnout in the latest round of voting was 50% - higher than the first round last week, when the turnout was the lowest since the Islamic revolution in 1979 amid widespread discontent, but still considerably low. Widespread discontent meant that millions of people boycotted the elections. Lack of choice in the candidates, dominated by Islamic hard liners, and the impossibility of real change as long as the supreme leader tightly controls policies added to their frustration. Some people who did not vote in the first round were persuaded to cast their ballot for Dr Pezeshkian this time round to prevent Mr Jalili from becoming the president. They feared that if he won, Iran would be heading for more confrontation with the outside world and that he would bring Iran more sanctions and further isolation.\n\nReuters Saeed Jalili enjoys strong support amongst Iran’s most religious communities",
        "Only the 'Lord Almighty' could convince me to quit - Biden\n\n8 hours ago By Mike Wendling in Madison, Wisconsin & Max Matza , BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images Mr Biden sat down for a rare primetime interview with ABC News on Friday\n\nUS President Joe Biden has said only the \"Lord Almighty\" could convince him to end his bid for re-election, as he sat for a rare primetime interview in an effort to calm Democratic concern over his candidacy. Speaking to ABC News on Friday, Mr Biden also declined to take a cognitive test and make the results public in order to reassure voters he is fit to serve another term. \"I have a cognitive test every single day. Every day I have that test - everything I do [is a test],\" he told George Stephanopoulos. The 81-year-old once again pushed back on the idea, aired by some Democratic officials and donors, that he should stand aside for a younger alternative following his disastrous debate with Donald Trump last week. Listen: Americast - I’m still standing: Biden strikes back Throughout the interview, Mr Stephanopoulos pressed the president on his capacity to serve another term, asking Mr Biden if he was in denial about his health and ability to win. “I don’t think anybody’s more qualified to be president or win this race than me,\" Mr Biden said, blaming his poor performance last week on exhaustion and a \"bad cold\". In the 22-minute interview, he also: Attempted to ease Democratic fears he had lost ground to Donald Trump since the debate, saying pollsters he had spoken to said the race was a \"toss-up\"\n\nRejected suggestions allies may ask him to stand aside. “It’s not going to happen,\" he said\n\nDismissed repeated questions about what would compel him to leave the race. \"If the Lord Almighty came down and said, ‘Joe, get out of the race,’ I’d get out of the race,” he said. “The Lord Almighty’s not coming down” The president answered questions more clearly than he did on the debate stage last week, but his voice again sounded weak and occasionally hoarse. It was a sharp contrast to his performance at a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, on Friday, where an energised Mr Biden acknowledged his disastrous performance in last week's CNN debate. \"Ever since then, there’s been a lot of speculation. What’s Joe going to do?” he told the crowd. “Here’s my answer. I am running and going to win again,” Mr Biden said, as supporters in the crucial battleground state cheered his name.\n\n'I am running and I'm going to win again,' Biden says\n\nThe interview and the rally come at a critical moment for his campaign, with donors and Democratic allies considering whether to stick with him. The campaign is aware that the next few days could make or break his re-election bid, according to various reports in US media, as Mr Biden seeks to regain ground that he lost to his Republican rival Donald Trump following the debate. As he took the stage at the rally, Mr Biden passed one voter who was holding a sign reading \"Pass the torch, Joe\". Another voter who stood outside the venue held a sign that read \"Save your legacy, drop out!\". \"I see all these stories that say I'm too old,\" Mr Biden said at the rally, before triumphing his record in the White House. \"Was I too old to create 15 million jobs?\" he said. \"Was I too old to erase student debt for five million Americans?\" “Do you think I’m too old to beat Donald Trump?\" he asked, as the crowd responded \"no\". Referencing Trump's criminal conviction in New York, and the other charges he is facing in separate cases, he called his rival a \"one-man crime wave\".\n\nSome voters at the Wisconsin rally tell the BBC they are open to change\n\nPressure on Mr Biden to step aside has only grown following the debate which was marked by several instances where he lost his train of thought, raising concerns about his age and mental fitness. Some major Democratic donors have begun to push for Mr Biden to step down as the party's nominee, publicly warning they will withhold funds unless he is replaced. His campaign is planning an aggressive come-back. His wife, Jill Biden, as well as Vice-President Kamala Harris, are planning a campaign blitz to travel to every battleground swing state this month. Mr Biden, who is due to speak at another rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday, thanked the vice-president for her support. She has emerged as the most likely candidate to replace him on the Democratic ticket if he were to step down. The Washington Post has reported that Mr Biden's senior team is aware of the pressure coming from within the Democratic Party to make a decision on the future of his candidacy within the next week. On Friday, reports emerged that House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries had scheduled a Sunday meeting with senior House Democrats to discuss Mr Biden’s candidacy. Four Democrats in the House of Representatives in Congress have now called for him to withdraw from the race - Lloyd Doggett of Texas, Raúl Grijalva of Arizona, Seth Boulton of Massachusetts and Mike Quigley of Illinois. “President Biden has done enormous service to our country, but now is the time for him to follow in one of our founding father, George Washington’s footsteps and step aside to let new leaders rise up and run against Donald Trump,” Mr Moulton told radio station WBUR on Thursday. However, no senior Democrats have called on him to quit, as his campaign has pointed out to reporters. On Friday, reports emerged that Senator Mark Warner was attempting to form a group of fellow Democratic senators to ask Mr Biden to drop out of the race. The reports, including one in the Washington Post, suggested Mr Warner had deep concerns following the CNN debate. Speaking to reporters later on Friday, Mr Biden said he understood that Mr Warner \"is the only one considering that\" and that no one else had called for him to step down. The same day, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey, a Democrat and ally of Mr Biden, issued a statement urging the president to \"carefully evaluate\" whether he remains the Democratic nominee. \"Whatever President Biden decides, I am committed to doing everything in my power to defeat Donald Trump,” she said.\n\nMore on US election",
        "'We've learnt to do surgery without electricity': Ukraine's power cuts worsen\n\n11 hours ago By Vitaly Shevchenko , BBC Monitoring Share\n\nEPA Extended blackouts are becoming increasingly common in Ukraine, as Russia targets its power grids\n\nPower supply is a matter of life and death for Tetiana's son. He was born with disabilities, and needs electricity-powered equipment to be able to breathe, to eat, and to receive medication. \"We are very dependent on electricity. If it wasn't for this bloody war, life would be difficult, but we'd be able to cope,” Tetiana tells the BBC. Ukrainians are learning to live with extended blackouts as Russia continues to pummel its energy facilities across the country. Persistent Russian air strikes mean even previously unaffected parts of Ukraine have to go without electricity for hours on end, practically every day. Tetiana, who lives in the southern port city of Odesa, says that the endless power cuts make life extremely difficult because she needs to make sure the supply of electricity is constant. She has a generator which runs on petrol and needs to be topped up all the time, but it has to be stopped every six hours to cool down. Power cuts also affect mobile phone coverage, so getting through to the ambulance service for her son can be a struggle too. \"Sometimes it takes half an hour, sometimes it's an hour before the ambulance arrives when my child goes into convulsions and turns blue,” she says. “My son can die if he doesn't get oxygen. I'm lost for words.” Recent blackouts have lasted as long as 12 hours a day in Tetiana's neighbourhood.\n\nTetiana Tetiana's son needs electricity-powered equipment to be able to breathe, to be fed and to receive medication\n\nFor millions of Ukrainians, the absence of power can mean no running water, air conditioning, lifts or access to life-saving equipment. Over the past three months alone, Ukraine has lost nine gigawatts of generating capacity, the national energy company Ukrenergo says. This is more than a third of the capacity Ukraine had before the full-scale invasion in February 2022. It is enough to power the whole of the Netherlands during peak hours of consumption – or Slovakia, Lavtia, Lithuania and Estonia combined, Ukrenergo says. \"All state-owned thermal power plants are destroyed. All hydropower plants in our country are damaged by Russian missiles or drones,\" Ukrenergo spokeswoman Maria Tsaturian tells the BBC. The lack of generated electricity is made worse by rising temperatures in the summer, when Ukrainians turn on power-hungry air conditioning systems. To cope with the shortfall, Ukrenergo has had to implement a policy of sweeping power cuts across the country, which last for many hours a day every day. As a result, millions of Ukrainians have become increasingly reliant on fuel-powered generators or big power banks.\n\nGetty Images Generators are an increasingly common sight in Ukraine\n\nThe Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, has been experiencing lengthy power cuts. Roksolana was elected by residents of her 24-storey apartment block to help run the building's facilities. She says living in tower blocks is not easy because power cuts also mean no running water on the upper floors. “The lifts are not working either, so mothers with children and disabled people have to wait. They plan their trips outside depending on when there is electricity,” she adds. “They've got to stay indoors for six hours on end, our elderly ladies can't pop out to the shops to get their bread.\" Such residents in tall buildings are stuck inside their sweltering apartments because air conditioning isn't working. They are also more exposed to Russian air strikes because they are unable to go to the safety of the bomb shelters, which are typically located underground. In Zaporizhzhia, dentist Volodymyr Stefaniv says appointments have to be rescheduled at the last moment, and there've been occasions when electricity disappeared during complicated surgery. \"If this happens, we start our generators so we can finish what we have started. There's no other way - we can't tell the patient to come back tomorrow,\" he says. \"Literally a couple of weeks ago power cuts became particularly frequent. Of course they're very disruptive.\"\n\nVolodymyr Stefaniv Dentist Volodymyr Stefaniv has to deal with power cuts during surgery",

He also repeated a previously rejected proposal for Ukraine to withdraw from regions in the south and east of the country which Russia claims to have annexed - an area that includes territory Russia does not currently occupy.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky has long said Ukraine will not negotiate with Moscow until Russian forces leave all Ukrainian territory, including Crimea.\n\nEarlier, Mr Putin said Mr Orban was visiting \"not just as a long-time partner\" but as a European Union representative.\n\nHowever, European leaders openly condemned the Moscow trip and emphasised he was not representing the EU.\n\n\"The EU rotating presidency has no mandate to engage with Russia on behalf of the EU,\" Charles Michel, President of the European Council, wrote on X.\n\n\"The European Council is clear: Russia is the aggressor, Ukraine is the victim.

        "'I'm worried' - Democrats at Biden rally open to change\n\n9 hours ago By Mike Wendling , BBC News, Madison, Wisconsin Share\n\nDemocratic voters chime in on Biden's ability to run for office\n\nThe hundreds of die-hard Democrats who turned out to see Joe Biden in Wisconsin on Friday didn’t need much convincing. The US president received an enthusiastic response to his loudly delivered remarks at the rally in Madison, especially when he attacked his Republican rival Donald Trump. But as some major Democratic donors and lawmakers call on Mr Biden to exit the presidential race, even some of his most ardent supporters here in Madison are keeping an open mind about whether he might be replaced - and what might come next. “It’s OK to change our minds,” said Catherine Emmanuelle, 44, who paused and considered her thoughts carefully before outlining her opinion. She stressed that she was impressed with Mr Biden’s 17-minute speech, which she called a “presidential litmus test”. “But if something happens in three days or a week or three weeks, we shouldn’t be afraid of having a conversation about change,” she told BBC News.\n\nCatherine Emmanuelle was pleased with the president's performance - but said she wasn't afraid of a tough conversation about the future of his candidacy\n\nMr Biden is under tremendous scrutiny after a disastrous debate performance last week, marked by a hoarse voice and several instances where he lost his train of thought. The president, 81, is facing a tide of doubts about his mental acuity and ability to beat Trump, 78, in November's election. Listen: Americast - I’m still standing: Biden strikes back Friday’s rally, held in this reliably Democratic town in a critical swing state, was an indication of the support Mr Biden still has in many parts of the country. But the raucous crowd, which waited through several opening speakers and a hour-long delay from the planned start time, was also shot through with low-grade anxiety. “I’m worried about his capacity to beat Trump,” said Thomas Leffler, a 33-year-old health researcher. \"As he gets older, I think it’s going to increasingly be an issue. But I’ll vote blue no matter what,\" he said - a reference the Democratic Party's signature colour.\n\nThomas Leffler was in a crowd of several hundred who came out to see President Biden\n\nMr Leffler suggested that picking a new candidate might have unexpected benefits. “If you go through some sort of open process, you can re-energise people, and show that there’s a process better than what Republicans have, which is basically just to bow down to Donald Trump,” he said. Earlier this year, both the president and Trump secured the delegates needed to be their party's respective presumptive candidates. The Democrats' nominee will officially be chosen at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago from 19-22 August. On Friday, Mr Biden was defiant about staying in the race, telling the crowd: \"I am running and going to win again.” Some of the biggest cheers on Friday came when the president directly went after his predecessor. “Trump is not just a convicted criminal,” he said. “He’s a one man crime wave.” The prospect of a second Trump administration was an animating factor for many who came to the rally. “During the debate, he told a bunch of lies,” said Greg Hovel, 67. “How is that any worse than what Biden did?”\n\nGreg Hovel said he was upset at recent Supreme Court decisions and Donald Trump's rhetoric\n\nMr Hovel said he believed the country was in a “great place” and that Mr Biden didn’t get enough credit for his economic and pandemic recovery policies. “At this point, in the next six weeks, the Democratic Party is going to have to make up its mind” whether to retain Mr Biden as their candidate or pick someone new, he said. But the president’s performance on Friday further bolstered something he strongly believed, even before the speech. “I think Biden can win,” he said. With additional reporting by Jonathan Csapo",

        "France ends ugly campaign and draws breath before historic vote\n\n12 hours ago By Paul Kirby , BBC News in Paris Share\n\nOLIVIER CHASSIGNOLE/AFP French lawyers protest after an extremist network publishes a list of \"lawyers to be eliminated\"\n\nFrance’s rushed and sometimes violent election campaign is over, brought to an end with stark appeals from political leaders ahead of Sunday’s pivotal vote. Centrist Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said on Friday night that a far-right government would “unleash hatred and violence”. But the leader of the National Rally, Jordan Bardella, accused his rivals of immoral, anti-democratic behaviour, and he urged voters to mobilise and give him an outright majority. One in three French voters backed National Rally (RN) last Sunday, in the first round of parliamentary elections.\n\nThe choice a week on is between France’s first far-right government of modern times or political deadlock, and voters fear there is turmoil ahead whoever wins. The climate is so fraught that 30,000 extra police are being deployed. Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said 51 candidates, or their deputies or party activists, had been physically attacked by people of varying backgrounds, including some who were “spontaneously angry”. In one incident, an extremist network published a list of almost 100 lawyers \"for eliminating\", after they signed an open letter against National Rally.\n\nREUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch Police are already out in force for the Paris Olympics and now they are being deployed for Sunday's vote\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron’s decision to call it less than a month ago came as a shock, but the consequences are unknown. When voters speak about the election, the tension is often palpable. Kaltoun’s hair is covered and says in her town on the border with Belgium, where RN won the first round, she and her daughter have felt increasingly uncomfortable. “It’s a remark or a look; each election it’s got worse.” In nearby Tourcoing, Gérald Darmanin is facing a strong challenge to hold his seat from the far-right candidate who was just 800 votes behind him last Sunday.\n\nFrance's interior minister is up against a far-right local candidate in his home town of Tourcoing\n\nThat is why left-wing candidate Leslie Mortreux decided to pull out of the second round to give him a better chance of defeating RN. In the 500 seats being decided by run-off votes, 217 candidates from the left-wing New Popular Front and the Macron Ensemble alliance have withdrawn to block the RN from winning. Although dozens of three-way races are still going ahead, 409 seats will now be decided by one-on-one contests. After the first round, some opinion polls gave RN a chance of winning an outright majority in the National Assembly. The final polls of the campaign suggest that is no longer on the cards. Even if RN boss Marine Le Pen believes they still have a “serious chance” of winning the 289 seats they need to control the Assembly, the pollsters say about 200 is a more realistic figure. One major poll that came out hours before the end of the campaign suggested that the awkward series of withdrawals by third-placed left-wing and centrist candidates had succeeded in scuppering the hopes of National Rally boss Marine Le Pen’s protege of becoming prime minister aged 28.\n\n“We are presiding over the birth of a single Mélenchon-Macron party,” Jordan Bardella complained. “And this dishonorable alliance has been formed with the single goal of keeping us from winning.” The Popular Front is made up of Socialists, Greens and Communists, but its biggest party is France Unbowed, led by radical firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon. He is widely condemned by his rivals as an extremist, and he is certainly no ally of President Emmanuel Macron. Despite their agreement to keep out the far right, there is no love lost between the two camps. “You don’t beat the far right with the far left,” the interior minister said, even though a France Unbowed candidate had pulled out to help him win. The Macron centrists are third in the polls, well behind the Popular Front as well as the National Rally. “In France we’re fed up with Macron, and I’m more in the centre” said Marc in Tourcoing. “The cost of living is bad, and the rich have become richer and the poor are poorer.\"\n\nNational Rally has focused its campaign on media appearances by Mr Bardella and Marine Le Pen, and there have been claims of “phantom candidates” barely showing up in some areas. When one candidate in the city of Orléans, Élodie Babin, qualified for the second round with little attempt at campaigning she later insisted she had been ill for 10 days. RN is especially popular in rural areas. In Mennecy, a sleepy town in the Essonne area south of Paris, Mathieu Hillaire was holding his final campaign event as Popular Front candidate. He is in a duel with RN candidate Nathalie Da Conceicao Carvalho, after the pro-Macron candidate pulled out to give her left-wing rival a better chance of blocking the far right.\n\nMatthieu Hillaire (R) of the New Popular Front is in a run-off with RN in the Essonne area south of Paris\n\nMr Hillaire said while the climate was less tense locally than elsewhere some people were still worried: “Of the voters that I’ve met, there are many who are scared of Jordan Bardella.” Many of RN’s policies focus on cutting the cost of living and tackling law and order, but their anti-immigration plans have raised particular concerns. RN aims to give French citizens “national preference” over immigrants for jobs and housing, and wants to abolish the right to automatic French citizenship for children of foreign parents, if those children have spent five years in France from the age of 11 to 18. Dual citizens would also be barred from dozens of sensitive jobs. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal spoke of an “uncertainty and worry” among the French people.",

It made landfall as a category-two hurricane early on Friday, bringing winds of up to 175km/h (108mph). It was later downgraded to a tropical storm, but is expected to re-intensify over the Gulf the Mexico at the weekend. Beryl brought heavy rain to tourist hotspots of Cancún and Tulum. No major damage was reported but the high winds felled trees and caused power outages.\n\nReuters The high winds brought down trees and structures including billboards\n\nCivil protection chief Laura Velazquez said power would be fully restored to those still without it by Sunday. Tulum resident Carolina Vazquez was among those to be affected by the outages, speaking to the Reuters news agency as she queued at a soup kitchen organised by the Mexican army on Friday. \"In my little house a tree fell down, half of the house cracked, the roof tiles,\" she said. Fernando Trevino, an employee at a local business, said: \"We are evaluating, but so far it seems that everything is in order with the protections that were put in place, the preparations and so.\" Ahead of Beryl's arrival, Schools were closed, hotel windows boarded up, and emergency shelters were set up in areas facing the brunt of the impact. More than 8,000 troops from the army, air force and national guard were deployed in the Yucatán Peninsula to provide support.

        "'Breakthrough' heightens hopes of Gaza ceasefire deal\n\nThe head of Israel's spy agency Mossad, David Barnea, is reported to have travelled alone to Doha to meet Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani as momentum is again building over a possible ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThis appears to be very much a preliminary move in what could once again be a complicated series of discussions aimed at finally bridging the gap between the Israeli government and Hamas over what each defines as its bottom line in what any potential deal would comprise.\n\nAfter Mr Barnea left Doha, the office of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said gaps still remained between the two sides. Israeli officials had already said that expectations need to be lowered.\n\nThe latest rekindling of hope for a deal came after Hamas delivered its response to the three-phase proposal that President Biden set out several weeks ago.\n\nThe key to that formulation was to put off what has long appeared to be the main obstacle in either side accepting a deal - the demand by Hamas that there must be a permanent ceasefire and the counter-demand by Israel that it must have the freedom to resume fighting in Gaza if necessary.\n\nExactly what Hamas has presented has not yet been made public. But the Israeli response appears far more positive than in other instances in the past seven months when the process has regained momentum. A source in Israel's negotiating team said that the proposal put forward by Hamas included a \"very significant breakthrough\".\n\nThere are indications that this could be that Hamas has accepted the key point of the proposal announced by President Biden - that it would allow negotiations to achieve its goal of a permanent end to the war through the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, rather than demanding it as the starting point.\n\nHamas has throughout bridled at its portrayal by the US in particular as the main stumbling block in agreeing a deal. Should it become clear that it has indeed made this concession, then the ball would be firmly back in the court of Mr Netanyahu.\n\nAt no time has he personally yielded an inch in his public commitment to the complete eradication of Hamas - and Israel's right to continue fighting in Gaza after any ceasefire. He has resisted all pressure from inside and outside Israel to modify that stance.\n\nBut the pressure has been building on him from all sides, inexorably.\n\nThe latest push seems to have come from within his own military. A recent article in the New York Times, citing unnamed current and former security officials, said that Israel's top generals \"want to begin a ceasefire in Gaza even if it keeps Hamas in power for the time being\".\n\nMr Netanyahu dismissed this as defeatist. But he may not be able to resist such pressure forever - nor the ever growing anger on the streets of Israel from those who want the remaining hostages in Gaza to be brought home now.\n\nFor Hamas, there are also some signs of growing despair over the continuing war by those who suffer from it every day, the civilian population of Gaza. And internationally, the patience of mediators, like Egypt and Qatar, may be running out.",

The Hartlepool result though, is a reminder that Sir Keir’s journey to Downing Street was far from straightforward. In fact, for a long time his life and career were on a very different path.\n\nKeir Starmer/Tom Baldwin Baby Keir was born to Labour-supporting parents\n\nKeir Starmer, one of four children, was brought up in the town of Oxted on the Kent-Surrey border. He was raised by his toolmaker father and nurse mother, who suffered from a debilitating form of arthritis known as Still’s disease. Sir Keir has spoken about the challenges of growing up at a time of high inflation in the 1970s. “If you’re working class, you’re scared of debt,” he said during the election campaign. “My mum and dad were scared of debt, so they would choose the bill that they wouldn’t pay.” The choice was the phone bill.\n\nLabour party/PA A young Keir, on the right, excelled at music, playing the flute, piano, violin and recorder\n\nSir Keir had a lot going on in his younger years. He was obsessed with football (on the centre-left of midfield, of course). He was a talented musician and learnt violin with Norman Cook, who went on to become chart-topping DJ Fatboy Slim. Sir Keir also had a rebellious streak. He and his friends were once caught by police illegally selling ice-cream on a French beach to raise cash. But what about politics? There were always clues, including his name which was given to him as a tribute to the first leader of the Labour Party, Keir Hardie. Sir Keir dabbled in left-wing politics over the course of his pre-parliamentary life.\n\nKeir Starmer/Tom Baldwin Sir Keir, pictured lying down, poses with flatmates during his student years in Leeds\n\nThat started at school, when he joined the Young Socialists, Labour’s youth movement. After school, Sir Keir became the first person in his family to go to university, studying law at Leeds University and later at Oxford. At Leeds, he was influenced by the indie music of the 1980s, from The Smiths and The Wedding Present to Orange Juice and Aztec Camera. His biographer, Tom Baldwin, notes his favourite drink as a student was a mix of beer and cider - or Snakebite - and he had a taste for curry and chips. For a while after graduating, Sir Keir lived above a brothel in north London.\n\nKeir Starmer/Tom Baldwin His parents, Rodney and Josephine, joined him on graduation day at Leeds University\n\nMore importantly, he was building a reputation as a workaholic that would see him go on to become a successful and prominent human rights lawyer. At the same time, Sir Keir continued his left-wing activism, as a prominent contributor to the magazine Socialist Lawyer. But politics was a side interest and, for much of the next 20 years, his legal career was his focus. In 2008, he became Director of Public Prosecutions, the chief prosecutor for England and Wales. Sir Keir likes to talk about this period in life as an example of his dedication to public service, and often recalls his role in prosecuting terrorist gangs. But what else?\n\nKeir Starmer/Tom Baldwin Sir Keir spent most of his legal career as a defence barrister\n\nUnder the 2010-15 coalition government, he had to implement significant cuts, with the Crown Prosecution Service’s budget reduced by more than a quarter. He also oversaw high-profile decisions including the prosecution of MPs over their parliamentary expenses following the 2009 scandal and prosecuting the then Lib Dem cabinet minister Chris Huhne for asking his wife to take speeding points for him. Sir Keir's legal work was rewarded with a knighthood in 2014. But how successful was his leadership? Towards the end of his tenure, Sir Keir admitted in a BBC interview that vulnerable victims were still being let down by the justice system.\n\nA late career change\n\nIt wasn't until the age of 52 that the career change came. Sir Keir was selected for a safe Labour seat in north London, winning comfortably. He and his predecessor Rishi Sunak became MPs on the same day. But it wasn’t a happy time for the Labour Party. The Conservatives had just won the general election and a bitter factional battle loomed after Jeremy Corbyn became leader.\n\nQuestions have persisted over Sir Keir's backing of Jeremy Corbyn\n\nMuch has been said and written about Sir Keir’s journey from backbencher to the Labour leadership – and now to Downing Street. But some things are worth highlighting. When he became leader, Jeremy Corbyn made Sir Keir shadow immigration minister but it didn’t last long. He resigned after less than a year, one of dozens of frontbenchers who quit after the Brexit referendum in an attempt to force Mr Corbyn out. When that failed, and Mr Corbyn saw off a leadership challenge, Sir Keir returned to the fold as shadow Brexit secretary.\n\nLabour in the doldrums\n\nSir Keir’s position on Mr Corbyn has evolved over time. In 2019, he was asked on BBC Breakfast to repeat the sentence “Jeremy Corbyn would make a great prime minister”. He did. A few months later, he would tell the BBC he was “100%” behind Mr Corbyn and working with him to win a general election. While others refused to serve under Mr Corbyn, Sir Keir stayed in the tent and helped persuade the leader to back a second Brexit referendum at the 2019 election. That election was a disaster for Labour. Mr Corbyn quit and Sir Keir won the race to replace him. But when he took over, a lot of people thought Boris Johnson was destined to govern for some time. Many saw Sir Keir as a leader who could help rebuild – but few thought he was the man who would take them back to power.\n\nReuters Sir Keir made big changes to the Labour party during his time in opposition\n\nWhen did that change? The polls give us a good indication. Sir Keir’s Labour trailed Mr Johnson’s Conservatives in the polls for much of 2020 and 2021 when the Hartlepool by-election was held. But that started to change after the first reports of Downing Street parties during the pandemic, when strict restrictions were in place around social gatherings. There is a clear point in the polls where Labour overtakes the Conservatives in November 2021. Its lead increased significantly after the Liz Truss mini budget and has been consistent and significant ever since.\n\nA 'ruthless' leader\n\nSir Keir’s allies argue that wouldn’t have happened without big changes in the Labour Party. Sir Keir has sometimes been ruthless. Jeremy Corbyn was thrown out of the parliamentary party and ultimately barred from standing as a Labour candidate. Economic policy was tightened; meaning policies were junked if they weren’t seen as affordable. Sir Keir embraced British patriotism, using the union jack as a backdrop for speeches and getting his conference to sing God Save the King. All of that has contributed to Sir Keir’s message of change. He spent the campaign arguing he had changed Labour and could change the country too.\n\nKeir Starmer/Tom Baldwin Sir Keir and Victoria married in 2007",
        "Meet the new youngest MP - born in 2002\n\n5 hours ago By Louise Parry , Louise Hulland , BBC News, Peterborough Share\n\nSam Carling Cambridge graduate Sam Carling, 22, is thought to be the youngest MP\n\nA 22-year-old elected as an MP with a razor-thin majority has said he does not want his age to be the focus as he heads to Westminster. Labour’s Sam Carling is likely to be the \"baby of the House\" - the unofficial title given to the youngest member of the House of Commons - after narrowly winning North West Cambridgeshire. The Cambridge University science graduate student beat veteran Conservative MP Shailesh Vara by 39 votes to take the seat. Mr Carling called his victory a \"political earthquake\", and said he hoped more young people would stand for public office.\n\n\"Then they will see themselves represented, both in Parliament and local councils. It will help tackle apathy,\" he said. The previous \"baby of the House\" was Oxford University graduate and fellow Labour MP Keir Mather, who won the Selby and Ainsty by-election in 2023.\n\nEmma Baugh/BBC Sam Carling hopes the Labour party can \"engage more young people\" in politics\n\nMr Carling, who has been a councillor in Cambridge, said many voters were surprised to discover he was running for office, but that \"people on the doorstep were very positive\". \"They said ‘That’s good, we need more young people’. \"There is a lot of abuse aimed at younger people online, but face-to-face, people are generally thrilled to find out.\"\n\nHowever, he doesn't want his age to be a focus. \"I want us to get away from this strange mindset towards younger people’s age. As far as I’m concerned we’re just the same as anyone else. I just want to get on with the job.\" He only recently became interested in politics, saying he saw a connection between social and economic decline and \"decisions made in Westminster\". Mr Carling grew up in a rural town in the north-east of England, which he described as \"a very deprived area\". \"I saw a lot of things getting worse around me. I was concerned about shops closing on local high streets that used to be a thriving hub and are basically now a wasteland. \"And the sixth form closed, but I didn't make the connection to politics until later.\"\n\nShariqua Ahmed/BBC Sam Carling beat Tory Shailesh Vara to win the North West Cambridgeshire seat\n\nIn his constituency, largely based in the city of Peterborough, he said the new Labour government had \"a whole host of issues to deal with – it's a microcosm of the country\". He wants his party to \"get to grips with\" a lack of dentists and NHS staff \"who are dreadfully overworked\", as well as \"fixing rural transport\". Mr Carling said it would be \"interesting to see\" what his generation makes of a new era of politics. \"I think a lot of people have only ever been conscious of a Conservative government. \"I would argue we can make significant changes and offer a better alternative, and hopefully engage more young people in politics,\" he added.\n\nFollow Peterborough news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

        "What went wrong for the Conservatives?\n\n19 hours ago By Ione Wells , Political correspondent Share\n\nReuters\n\nThe Conservative Party had become accustomed to almost being the Manchester City of politics. A blue, winning machine for so long that some of its key players could barely remember anything else. But their streak - that delivered Tory prime ministers in four elections in a row - has been brought to a dramatic end. Many Tories, both winners and losers, are almost speechless and still processing it. One told me they were simply \"not coherent\". A post-mortem on what went wrong with their tactics and leadership, and where to go next, is now beginning.\n\nWhen I speak to Conservatives, several themes come up repeatedly. Some feel Labour's policy offering was not drastically different to theirs, but think the choice became more about perceptions of \"competence\". They have had five leaders, and prime ministers, in less than 10 years. Seismic events, from Brexit to Covid to multiple leadership contests, splintered the party into ideological factions. Some Tories spent more energy plotting to take each other down than their opposition - and never really patched things up. Scandals rocked the party in a whack-a-mole fashion, from lockdown parties to sexual misconduct allegations to a mini-budget that contributed to raising interest rates. An election betting saga was the cherry on top. When I asked former Chief Whip Sir Mark Spencer during the campaign if the party had a conduct problem, he mentioned that other parties also had to suspend MPs for poor behaviour - which is true - but conceded this had become too regular. Then there was the undoubted desire for change - a word Labour deployed in its campaign. The cost of living, NHS waiting lists, and small boats were all issues voters raised on the doorstep - and felt had been getting worse, not better. Nigel Farage's late return to the fray meant the latter theme became a particular thorn in Tory sides, with some right-leaning voters who switched to Reform UK wanting tougher immigration policies and lower taxes. Rhetoric and policies attempting to win them back alienated some more centrist Tories who abandoned the party for Labour or the Liberal Democrats, leaving the Tories pincered in between. This was a more comfortable switch for some centrists who didn’t feel they could vote Labour under Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nDid these circumstances mean defeat was inevitable? Most Tories I've spoken to describe the result as \"not unexpected\", but some feel the scale of it could have been mitigated. There were avoidable gaffes - like Rishi Sunak leaving D-day commemorations early. While Boris Johnson was prone to gaffes too, some of his fans felt Mr Sunak didn’t charm voters back in the same way. The former prime minister still yielded chants of ‘Boris! Boris!’ at an eleventh-hour rally to try to energise the campaign. There is still a lingering bafflement among some about why Mr Sunak decided to call the election in July. Their campaign guru, Isaac Levido, had argued for a later date - hoping by then there would be more \"measurables\" to demonstrate their policies were having an impact. A flight of asylum seekers taking off to Rwanda, for example, or an interest rate cut. But he lost that argument. And the Conservatives had little evidence in their armoury of some of their policies working when they went to the electorate. The risk of the alternative, Mr Levido's critics argued, was that more bad news could come down the road for the Tories - more Channel crossings this summer, more offenders being released because of prison overcrowding, universities going under. But policy and identity wise, what else could the Conservatives have done? That's where their focus will lie now as a search for the soul of the party begins.\n\nWhat - and who - could come next?\n\nMr Sunak has confirmed he will resign as Tory leader once arrangements are in place to choose his successor. There have been murmurings for the last few weeks about whether an interim leader is appointed to avoid the awkwardness of, for example, the former PM having to do Prime Minister's Questions from the opposition benches. Could this be someone who served in the cabinet previously - like Sir Oliver Dowden, James Cleverly, or even Jeremy Hunt, who just about scraped back into the Commons? If so, it would probably need to be someone who doesn't actually want to run for leader full time. Otherwise, Mr Sunak could stay on until the next Tory leadership contest concludes. There are some MPs who have been working behind the scenes for a long time on shoring up their support, including Kemi Badenoch (the bookies' favourite) who is on the right of the party, and Tom Tugendhat, who is more to the centre. Former contenders like Suella Braverman and former Sunak ally-turned-critic Robert Jenrick are tipped to run too. They both spent time in the Home Office, are on the right of the party, and have criticised the government's record on immigration. One interesting thing to note, though, is who the remaining Tory MPs are, and what that might mean for who wins support among the parliamentary party. I've had a quick skim over the new intake of Tory MPs and who they backed in the first Tory leadership contest of July-September 2022. Interestingly, the majority are Sunak-backers, with a hefty chunk of Liz Truss supporters too. Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch have lost a couple of their key allies on the right of the parliamentary party. A couple of Mr Tugendhat’s backers are gone too.\n\nSome of the most notable Conservative losses this election",
        "After the impotence of opposition, Keir Starmer prepares to wield power\n\n11 hours ago By Laura Kuenssberg , @bbclaurak, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg Share\n\nGetty Images\n\n“A face of thunder.” As opposition leader, Sir Keir Starmer would go back to his office after the State Opening of Parliament deeply frustrated after witnessing the Conservatives’ plans laid out year after year. He carried the curse of the leader of the opposition – irrelevance. He formally became prime minister at lunchtime on Friday, but for a number of months now, he has also known that the British state has been quietly preparing for his arrival in Downing Street. “We have every hour of his first day, every day of his first week, every week of his first month, mapped out,\" is how one Whitehall source put it. What promise this victory holds is not going to fail because of a lack of homework or planning. Such is the level of preparation that the Treasury, in anticipation of the arrival of the first female chancellor, has apparently boxed in the urinal that has long been a feature of the chancellor’s private bathroom. Not exactly bog standard stuff, you could say (sorry!).\n\nSign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.\n\nRachel Reeves is one of the prominent figures in Sir Keir’s team, among them also Wes Streeting and Bridget Phillipson, who have been deeply involved for months in getting ready to govern. Senior civil servants and their shadow ministers have been talking for some time and Sir Keir and some of his team have been regular attendees at Cobra meetings, and security briefings. One, now a cabinet minister, told me: “We have got personal relationships with the permanent secretary and the senior officials already.“ The former civil servant Sue Gray, who will now be the PM's chief of staff, has been in regular contact with Cabinet Secretary Sir Simon Case, since the turn of the year. After the headlines of the Labour leader's missions had been turned into policies, they were then made into “implementation plans\" for government. The calls between Ms Gray and Sir Simon became almost daily. There has been some perhaps less obvious assistance, too. At least two former Conservative ministers have been helping them prepare, including one recent cabinet minister who told me: “It’s ridiculous we just hand over a trillion pound budget” without the kind of transition that an American president, for example, enjoys.\n\nThe plan for government\n\nDespite the scale of victory, the Labour manifesto, based on Sir Keir’s mission, is not about to be usurped with a huge bold unknown move. “There are no secrets,” one senior figure told me. Another source told me the election result is a vindication of the PM's cautious approach and it is not a “vote for a more radical, bold approach”. Expect strong resistance to any calls from the left that the scale of the change “proves” Labour could have been more radical in what they put forward. Some in his party may demand a rapid cessation of arm sales to Israel. Labour losing seats and nearly losing others to opponents standing on a pro-Gaza platform will only make those calls more urgent. Other demands may include an overt commitment to safeguard public services, a longer-term promise to remove the two-child benefit cap and even regular trade union access to No 10. But with a massive majority, there is no suggestion that Sir Keir will feel he is in the mood to redraft his carefully worked out plans. Instead the new prime minister has held up the result as a rejection of the Tory Party and a vote for a different type of leadership, and frankly, less drama. But his style, and the gradual way in which his plans were built over a period of many months, belies some very significant changes Labour wants. These include an expansion of rights for workers, a rapid overhaul of the planning system and a state energy company. In the short-term, new ministers are likely to do everything they can to talk up how they want to get the economy to grow. It won’t be entirely coincidental if within a few weeks, companies start writing cheques for the UK, or that pent -up investments that were waiting for a change of government start to come through.\n\nAnd it’s likely that before long there will be new draft laws to give more powers to the government’s independent economic watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. One of the big first decisions the new chancellor needs to make is when to hold a huge review of the public finances with the teeth clenching decisions it might involve. The so-called spending review, which portions out cash between departments, expires at the end of the year. It sounds like a dull decision but it is massively important. Ms Reeves will have to decide whether to roll over the existing Tory spending plans for a year, to give her more space to work out a longer-term plan, or crack on with her own review by the end of 2024. Watch this space.\n\nBeware of drift\n\nThe Labour mantra in public, and in private has been not just to win, but to be ready to get things done. In their mind are what they see as the lessons of New Labour and Tony Blair’s frustration with the slow pace of change. One new minister tells of a meeting where they briefed the former PM about their plans and he warned them: “I so deeply regret that we didn’t hit the ground running on reform.\" “Keir has taken this incredibly seriously,\" the minister told me. Appointing the cabinet’s been done, but there are dozens of other MPs to receive government jobs, with advisers and new members of the House of Lords. They include the former Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance who has been appointed as a minister of state at the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. I’m told the former health secretary, Alan Milburn, is likely to take a senior, though not ministerial, role at the Department of Health to help drive waiting lists down. Other departments and other appointments might throw up some interesting names. But for all the preparation and experience, the receipt of power and responsibility is huge. One official said of incoming prime ministers: “They come in exhausted from this now-seemingly endless campaign, they come in elated, they appoint their cabinet – that is a great moment for them. And then sour-faced people like me say, ‘now, can I talk to you about the end of the world!’” Sir Keir is in a hurry not just to show the public that his government can actually get things done after years of visible political shambles. But he’s also been counselled to make the most of the early goodwill from his vast ranks of new victors, before, inevitably in time, however long, the Parliamentary Labour Party starts to flex its muscles. One former Labour adviser told me, he should \"Go quick! Go fast, before they find the loos!\" It is true that his team has tried very hard to control the quality of candidates, and many loyalists will be picking up their pass for the first day in the big palace soon. But as former prime ministers have found, bright-eyed new recruits don’t stay eager forever.\n\nProblems and Pitfalls\n\nLabour’s scale of victory is something they could have hardly dreamed of not so long ago. But their elation this weekend doesn’t make some of the very tricky realities of governing go away. Whenever she’s been near a microphone in recent months, Ms Reeves has been warning of what she calls the \"worst economic inheritance since the Second World War\" or as she said at her election count in Leeds \"there is not a huge amount of money\". Waiting lists are sky high. Prisons are overcrowded. Millions of families are struggling to make ends meet. This was an election result driven partly by voters’ clear feeling that nothing works. That sense is not confined to public perception. As one senior Whitehall official told me: “Things really are worse on the inside than you can see from outside.\"\n\nLabour’s ministerial teams have been discussing how to tell the public how bad, in their view, things really are. No sooner had Mr Streeting been appointed health secretary than he said: “From today the policy of this department is that the NHS is broken.” A sceptic might also say Labour will be keen to brand the problems once and for all as the Tories’ fault.\n\nThe mission\n\nWhat of the new PM himself? It’s not lost on the public, or his political critics, that he has been willing to junk old promises, and indeed, to junk old colleagues if need be. His backers say it’s a sign of strength, and was a lesson he had to learn - ditching what one source described as “nauseating” pleas for party unity for a clearer priority, the desire to win. It is no easier now to get to the bottom of what Sir Keir believes in than it was when I first sat down with him. Back then he was pitching for the leadership of his party, when his aim to get them back into power looked fanciful. He and his team had come up with the phrase “moral socialism”. Then, as now, it sounded like a slogan designed for a Guardian newspaper headline rather than something the public could latch on to. He told me he wanted to persuade people that Labour and politicians could be a “force for good and a force for change“. That’s a line that could feature in one of his many interviews or speeches four years later, where still, you might be searching for a grand ideological mantra. But perhaps to hunt for an ideology is to miss the point. He is not a factional politician who’s been in the trade, man and boy, not a product of student union elections, decades of party conferences, fevered debates about the purity of particular policies. For his backers, that arguable absence of an ideology is his huge advantage. “He’ll be the most normal PM we’ve ever had,” says one insider. One minister tells me he belongs not to any faction but to the party. “He is theirs,” the new minister says. Whether Sir Keir can make the public feel that kind of direct connection with him as a leader seems ambitious and highly uncertain. He sometimes apes Tony Blair, saying he’ll return politics to serve the people through what he terms national renewal. But despite the size of the majority, there is little sign at this moment that he could achieve that kind of incredible personal popularity the 1997 victor saw.\n\nA second term?\n\nIt was Sir Keir’s belief that the modern electorate could be incredibly volatile that led him to have faith that he could turn the 2019 disaster round. The willingness of so many voters to change their minds has been Keir Starmer’s friend at this election but if that volatility is here to stay, it could become his foe. In time, and perhaps soon, Labour will start plotting privately how this term in office can be extended into what Starmer has already set out as his goal of a “decade of renewal“. Just before polling day, one insider joked: “I’m never not thinking about winning the next election.” By any traditional measure, a majority on this scale would see a prime minister securely locked into two terms of office. But in 2024 that feels less certain. For now for Labour, there is a moment of profound celebration. No more the impotence of opposition. No more the pain of losing yet again. No more “face of thunder” for the new prime minister, or the frustration of being irrelevant. As we saw in Downing Street yesterday, after all the waiting, he can allow himself a smile.",
        "Iran's new president gives hope to some women and younger voters\n\nA relatively moderate member of the Iranian parliament, Masoud Pezeshkian has been declared the next president of Iran after beating his hardline conservative rival by a decisive margin in Friday’s run-off presidential elections.\n\nThe 69-year-old will replace Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nMr Pezeshkian’s mostly young supporters took to the streets of the capital, Tehran, and other cities to celebrate - even before the final results were declared, singing, dancing and waving his campaign's signature green flags.\n\nHe has given some of the nation's younger generation hope at a time when many were despondent about their future.

        "Historic first as president takes on Kenya's online army\n\nPresident William Ruto took part in the X Space from state house\n\nThis was a first.\n\nPerhaps a turning point in Kenya’s civic engagement.\n\nThe willingness of Kenya’s President William Ruto to engage in a live audio discussion on X Spaces was keenly anticipated, coming just 10 days after deadly anti-government protests.\n\nThe beginning, however, was cringeworthy.\n\nParticipants struggled to connect. And there were three or four false starts.\n\nFinally, after a shaky first hour, someone who it was thought would be chairing a parallel conversation on X as a rival to the president’s efforts, hosted Mr Ruto’s interaction, which meant he had the power to decide who was allowed to speak.\n\nThis was an X user who went by the name of Osama Otero. He has been one of a handful of social media users who have emerged as key voices in the successful campaign to block a finance bill that was set to raise a series of taxes.\n\n“Traitor” his compatriots posted on X, getting the word to trend. There was no doubt this was the result of some sort of effort to get those involved in the protests to take part.\n\nThe questions were direct and raw.\n\nSpeakers challenged the president about his and his government's record and conduct.\n\nAs host, Mr Otero set the tone.\n\n“Are we in a terrorist country?” he asked, referring to the brutal police response to the protests that left dozens dead.\n\nHe questioned the government’s official casualty numbers, insisting that possibly hundreds had died in the demonstrations. President Ruto challenged the speaker to produce the families of those alleged to have been killed and their bodies hidden.\n\n“Do we really matter as people who elected you?” said Miller, a cameraman who said he had witnessed a protester being shot dead outside parliament. With the anger obvious in his voice he said: “I’m really pissed off. Guys, go back and reflect.”\n\nAn unabashed Marvin Mabonga, an unemployed university graduate, told the president: “In your cabinet, we have so many incompetent cabinet secretaries.”\n\nReturning to the theme of those who died last week, the host asked if the president had “tried to reach out to any of the families of those who were killed or injured”.\n\nThe president replied that he had contacted the mother of a 12-year-old who was shot dead during the protests just outside Nairobi.",
        "Celebrating 50 years of marriage in Nigeria’s 'divorce capital'\n\n11 hours ago By Mansur Abubakar , BBC News, Kano Share\n\nMahmud Yakasai\n\nA couple who live in Nigeria’s “divorce capital” are being hailed for their long marriage having recently celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Mahmud Kabir Yusuf and Rabiatu Tahir spoke to the BBC about the secrets of their happiness, and about why so many marriages fail in the northern city of Kano, in a video that has generated much comment. Mr Yusuf puts it down to his wife’s generous nature. “She is a very unselfish person and she overlooks a lot which has contributed to the success of our marriage,” the 76-year-old told BBC Hausa. This prompts a smile from Ms Tahir, who is in her late sixties. Together the couple have had 13 children - and she praised her husband’s ability to remain calm in the face of the difficulties all families confront. “He is a very patient man and I feel that was also key to our success,” she said. The pair say they love and respect each other - and they clearly enjoy each other’s company, breaking off to laugh several times during the interview. For Hassana Mahmud, it is a revelation. The 39-year-old divorcee has been married five times and is impressed by the couple and their evident contentment. \"In all my marriages I have only spent four years with a spouse - so to see them on social media celebrating this milestone was refreshing,” she said. “My husbands were all nice and caring during courtship but changed after the wedding,\" said the mother of four. “I feel bad whenever I hear people call Kano 'the divorce capital of Nigeria', I hope things will change,\" she added. Kano gained the epithet after divorce rates began to rise in the 1990s and it has not been able to shake off the unwanted label. Hundreds of marriages collapse each month in Nigeria’s most populous state, whose capital, Kano city, is the commercial hub of the north. In 2022 research done by the BBC in collaboration with the local government disclosed that 32% of marriages in Kano state only survive between three and six months. It also revealed that some people aged between 20 and 25 had already gone through three marriages.\n\nGetty Images Brides and grooms arriving for a mass wedding at Kano's central mosque in 2023\n\nThe scale of separations is a concern - especially for the Hisbah, a Kano state-funded Islamic agency that deals with moral issues and enforces Sharia, or Islamic law in the state. It has a police unit that enforces things like segregation in public places and an alcohol ban for Muslims, who make up the majority of residents. It also has a counselling service mainly to help struggling married couples. Long lines of women can often be seen queueing outside its offices to complain that their ex-husbands are not helping with maintenance for their children. People tend to marry young in Kano - often before the legal age of 18. Others feel Islam’s easy method of divorce might be a factor as husbands can simply tell their wives: “I divorce you” or write that on a piece of paper and it is over. Nowadays a message sent on social media is enough to end their marriage. Aminu Daurawa works for the Hisbah to address the high divorce rate. One of their solutions is to offer a second chance to people and better prepare them for married life. The agency organises mass marriages, known as “Auren Zawarawa”, mainly for divorcees - acting as a matchmaker on a giant scale. The hundreds of newly wed couples, who are treated to a big wedding ceremony, are also offered a small sum to help them set up a business and other household goods. This initiative began in 2012 - though Mr Daurawa acknowledges divorce rates are still high. “We know about that problem - that is why we set up a committee to check on each couple after the marriage so we don't get the former [same] results,” he said.\n\nAFP Couples at Kano's mass weddings are given some household items to help them set up house\n\nBut Hadiza Ado, founder of non-governmental organisation Women and Children Initiative, says the number of divorces continue to rise. “At the moment we get up to 30 marital cases daily in our various offices,” she told the BBC. “The troubling Nigerian economy is the number-one reason at the moment. “Husbands go out to make ends meet and sometimes come back home empty-handed, which causes rifts.” The practice of using matchmakers is common in Kano because in a Muslim society single people do not mix, so it is difficult to meet potential partners. The only place that the sexes mix would be at university or other tertiary institutions, which most people do not attend. When people are matched together they often get married hardly knowing each other. In fact Mahmud Kabir Yusuf and Rabiatu Tahir were introduced as youngsters by an older woman in their neighbourhood. She was the one who felt they would be a good match - but they did not tie the knot for another 12 years, giving them ample time to get to know one another.\n\nMatchmaker Rabiu Ado (R) has the nickname \"Mai Dalili\", meaning \"He who makes it happen\"\n\nOne man with a reputation for making successful matches says that is key. “A lot of investigation needs to be done before marriage to know the persons involved,” Rabiu Ado told the BBC. He set up as a matchmaker 10 years ago. The 46-year-old had not intended to become a marriage broker, though it had been the job of his mother. He was working as a truck driver when he was approached by friends complaining about the difficulty of finding a partner. After making some successful introductions, he realised he had a knack for the family business. He now has billboards advertising his services - and gets between one and five clients each day. He interviews them and gets to know their attitudes and expectations. Often men want a woman who can make money and women want rich men. “A lot of people go into marriages with the wrong mindset, which is why they get disappointed after some time.” He says he has organised around 500 marriages over the last decade, with a success rate of more than 90%. He counsels couples to always take time to know each other well before marrying. Mr Ado, who has the nickname \"Mai Dalili\" meaning \"He who makes it happen\", says the high number of divorces means some people don't take marriage seriously. “I feel why divorce is high in Kano is because people feel I can always get another person after a divorce.”\n\nMahmud Kabir Yusuf Mahmud Kabir Yusuf and Rabiatu Tahir knew each for 12 years before they married\n\nIslamic cleric Abdullahi Ishaq Garangamawa defends the ease with which Muslims can get a divorce. “Islam is merciful and made marriages and divorces not hard so that people will not be caged when things aren't going right,” he told the BBC. \"In the past we didn't have this many divorces as our parents were married for decades. It was in recent times that people started abusing the process for selfish interests,\" he says. \"But in essence, unlike in some religions where it's till death no matter the situation, Islam legalises divorce when things get out of hand.\" Mr Yusuf, who used to work for the now-defunct Nigeria Airways, says sharing life’s difficulties and helping one another has been crucial to his enduring partnership with Ms Tahir. “Love is also key because when you love each other genuinely you tend to stay together. “My advice to people getting married is not to get into it for selfish reasons but go into it with genuine intentions.” His wife agrees, adding: “My own advice is that people wanting to get married have to be patient with each other - if one partner is angry, the other should be calm.” Additional reporting by Abba Awwalu\n\nMore Nigeria stories from the BBC:\n\nGetty Images/BBC",

        "Rescue street dogs, or euthanise them? Turks split over its strays\n\n11 hours ago By Victoria Craig , BBC News, Ankara Share\n\nBBC Gokcen Yildiz cares for 160 street dogs at her property outside Ankara\n\nUnder the shade of a leafy green apricot tree on a scorching summer afternoon, Gokcen Yildiz scoops up a squirming ball of light-brown fur. It licks her all over the face and she breaks out in giggles. But laughter gives way to a more serious tone as she points to the dog's back legs, which are missing paws. A sign, she says, of the abuse some of Turkey’s street dogs are subjected to. Ms Yildiz is a secondary school physics teacher by day, street-dog advocate by night. The canine she’s holding is one of 160 she’s collected on the property where she lives on the outskirts of Turkey’s capital city, Ankara. Her dogs are a small fraction of the estimated four million that make up the country’s street-dog population. It’s a problem that has fiercely divided public opinion: are stray dogs a neighbourhood fixture to be looked after and loved? Or does the government need to take more drastic solutions, like those state media are reporting that it's considering - including euthanasia? On her 15,000 sq m property, Ms Yildiz looks after elderly and disabled dogs, and those with psychological or behavioural issues. “It is not my job, but I look after dogs in need,” she said. “I always experience financial worry because the economy is getting harder. When the price of petrol increases, everything like pet food or the medicine I give, or the vet expenses - everything goes up.”\n\nTurkey's government estimates the country now has around four million street dogs\n\nShe said she feels anxious about finances, but her bigger concern is what will happen to the dogs if she doesn’t collect them. “The dogs outside of here eat every two or three days, but they’re alive. They’re not about to die. That’s what really worries me,” she said. Lawmakers from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) are working on a new bill aimed at getting dogs off the streets. It hasn’t yet been introduced into the country’s parliament, but state media report it could require municipalities to collect stray dogs, shelter them for around 30 days, and if the animals are not adopted in that time, euthanise them. The latter provision has outraged animal rights activists - and Turkey’s dog lovers, like Ms Yildiz - but it’s also raised questions about whether existing facilities across the country could handle additional responsibilities. Only about one third of the nation’s provincial and district municipalities have shelters, according to Doctor Murat Arslan, president of the Turkish Veterinary Medical Association.\n\nGetty Images Some have protested against the planned law - but polls suggest a majority think something must be done\n\nHe said this had been one of the problems with an existing law, which requires dogs to be sterilised and then returned to the streets where they lived. “In order to manage the animal population, street dogs needed to be collected, sterilised, given some vaccinations, and then released back to the street. However, not every municipality had shelters or facilities where these operations could be carried out. Especially in small municipalities, there are neither shelters nor sufficient employment of veterinarians.” If this law, enacted 20 years ago, had been enforced, the street-dog population wouldn’t be so large today, Dr Arslan said. Animal abandonment and overbreeding and selling of dogs had also allowed the street-dog population to rise, he told the BBC. Although animals are microchipped and registered in a centralised database, officials needed to be better at following through with fines for owners when animals were found to have been thrown out on the street, he added. Regardless of what led to the problem, campaign groups like Safe Streets Association argue a solution is needed to take dogs permanently off the street.\n\nGetty Images Stray dogs have become an issue all across Turkey",
        "Sacred buffalo calf offers hope amid efforts to revive species\n\n8 hours ago By Max Matza , BBC News, Seattle Share\n\nIndigenous people celebrate birth of rare white buffalo\n\nWith cream-colored fur and jet-black eyes, one of the smallest specimens of America’s largest native animal stumbled into the spotlight on shaky legs. Advocates hope the June birth of a white buffalo calf - an exceedingly rare event - will translate into new momentum for a decades-long push to revive the species in America's Great Plains. Many tribes consider a white bison birth to be a sacred omen that signifies change. The herd this calf was born into has also become an important cultural symbol - it's the last wild buffalo herd in North America. The herd is entering a new chapter of its life as stewardship of the species is increasingly being overseen by indigenous communities again and advocates push to grow bison populations. The American buffalo, also known as bison, once numbered in the tens of millions before being brought to the brink of extinction in the 1800s. Now, the only wild herd in the US is limited to just 5,000 animals. But tribes and bison advocates see opportunity as Yellowstone, America’s first national park and the home of the white calf, considers a proposal to expand the wild herd’s size for the first time in decades. The white calf has added spiritual significance to buffalo advocates' efforts as they test a long-standing status quo where government policies prioritise beef ranching over the beliefs of native tribes.\n\nA prophecy revealed\n\nJust after noon on 4 June, Yellowstone photography guide Jordan Creech was sightseeing with clients when he spotted the freshly-born white buffalo calf, taking its first steps in the park’s Lamar Valley. Bison calves can walk within two minutes of being born, and run alongside their herd within the first seven minutes of life. “It’s the most unique experience I’ve ever had,” Creech says. Erin Braaten, a photographer of Native American descent from Kalispell, Montana, also witnessed the calf’s first moments of life before it disappeared into the herd. \"I thought I'd have a better chance of capturing Bigfoot than a white bison calf,\" she tells BBC News. For the last 2,000 years the people of the Lakota, Dakota and Nakoda tribes have told the story of a woman who arrived during a time of need. A version speaks of two scouts searching for food and buffalo in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The mysterious woman appeared and offered their tribe a bundle of sacred gifts, including a pipe carved from red rock, and instructed the people on how to live and pray. She transformed several times before taking the form a white buffalo calf with a black nose, black eyes and black hooves. As she departed, a great number of buffalo returned to feed the people. Dozens of other tribes have white buffalo stories, interpreting its arrival as both a blessing and a warning.\n\nBuffalo Field Campaign Chief Arvol Looking Horse, a Lakota spiritual leader, is the 19th generation to maintain the sacred pipe and bundle given by the White Buffalo Woman\n\nChief Arvol Looking Horse, a spiritual leader of the Lakota Tribe, is known as the Keeper of the Sacred Bundle — the bundle and pipe left by the spirit. He likens the white calf’s return to the second coming of Christ. Looking Horse, 70, said that before she departed, the woman told the people that she would return as a white buffalo calf “when everything is sickly and not good, and when people are with a not good mind”. “This is spirit. It means spirit is happening,” he added. On 26 June, more than 500 supporters formally celebrated the white calf at an event in West Yellowstone, just outside the park. Nearly a dozen tribes were represented. Together, they heard the name bestowed upon the calf - Wakan Gli, meaning Sacred Returns or Comes Holy in the Lakota language. An altar of three buffalo skulls and three buffalo robes marked the occasion. Waemaetekosew Waupekenay, 38, who travelled from Wisconsin to attend on behalf of the Menominee Tribe, said the birth of the sacred calf has been a spiritual awakening. Its arrival, he says with amazement, shows that “there's a lot of healing, a lot of love going around. People are being united.”\n\nBuffalo Field Campaign An altar was erected for the event to honour the white calf\n\nNational Park rangers at Yellowstone have confirmed the white bison's birth, but rangers have not reported any sightings themselves. “The birth of a white bison calf in the wild is a landmark event in the ecocultural recovery of bison by the National Park Service,” the park said in a statement on 28 June confirming it as the first white bison ever seen inside Yellowstone. They added that it \"may reflect the presence of a natural genetic legacy that was preserved in Yellowstone’s bison, which has revealed itself because of the successful recovery of a wild bison population\". \"The National Park Services acknowledges the significance of a white bison calf for American Indians,” it added.\n\nA species reborn\n\nThe Yellowstone bison make up the only wild herd in the US and are among the last genetically pure bison in existence. But Yellowstone National Park regularly reaches the legally-permitted capacity of 5,000. Tribes who support the species' growth have stepped in, believing the species' health is tied to their own history. Since 2019, the US National Park Service has transferred 414 healthy bison from Yellowstone to 26 tribes in 12 states through the Bison Conservation Transfer Program. Native people also have their own distribution system to share buffalo independent of the park's efforts. Since 1992, the Intertribal Buffalo Council - a collective of 83 tribes working to “restore the cultural, spiritual and historic relationships” with the animals - has sent 25,000 bison to 65 herds on tribal lands in 22 states. “People don’t understand or realise that what happened to the buffalo similarly happened to native people, and that history is intertwined,” says Jason Baldes, who serves as vice-president of the council and is a member of the Eastern Shoshone Tribe. The returning of buffalo to tribal people marks a major change in federal policy for a country whose soldiers had once been ordered to kill them all to deprive tribes of food and supplies. And officials are not only returning animals, they're considering taking on more themselves: the National Park Service has just completed an environmental impact study at Yellowstone, and determined that the size of the herd should increase from 5,000 to 6,000 - but could accommodate as many as 10,000. It's the first time the park has proposed an increase in 24 years. The herd’s growth is made more striking by the fact that up to 60 million American buffalo were killed in the rush to claim ownership of the American frontier. Unlike the native people - who are known to use nearly every part of the animal for food, shelter and more – the settlers killed them with reckless abandon, taking furs and leaving carcasses to rot. By the 20th Century, no more than 1,000 bison remained in the wild. Large-scale cattle operations took over the empty land and commercial interests continue to be a source of conflict between those who wish to see the wild buffalo roam as they once did, and the livestock industry.\n\nDoug Spriggs/InterTribal Buffalo Council Bison seen being released by the InterTribal Buffalo Council\n\nRanchers and the state's Republican governor oppose the park service’s proposal to expand the herd, fearing a disease called brucellosis - which is carried by about 60% of Yellowstone bison - could infect beef herds and undercut profit margins. The Montana Stockgrowers Association, which opposes the plan, has warned that the new policy could lead “to an exponential growth in bison numbers”. Elk are also known to transfer brucellosis to domestic livestock, but do not face the same restrictions as bison. Mike Mease of the Buffalo Field Campaign, a Montana-based non-profit which works to increase wild bison numbers, says the debate “is part of the old range wars of the West, competition for grass and which animals get to eat it”. Yellowstone officials previously conceded that the controversy over bison management is a complex challenge with several opposing interest groups. “It’s probably the single-most challenging wildlife issue in Yellowstone,” Cam Sholly, the park superintendent, told the New York Times last year. “The bison is the only species we constrain to a boundary.” But for tribes, the birth of the white calf is proof that more needs to done to support bison. The fact that the calf comes from Yellowstone has imparted it with extra spiritual significance. “The Yellowstone [herd] are the most purest, wildest buffalo – the only left in the country,” Chief Looking Horse says. “This is a message that Mother Earth is speaking through the animal nation.”",
        "Victoria Starmer: Who is the new PM's wife?\n\n1 day ago By Kate Whannel , Political reporter Share\n\nReuters\n\nThroughout the general election campaign and much of her husband's tenure as Labour leader, Victoria Starmer has kept a low profile. Apart from appearances at Labour conferences, the odd state banquet and a Taylor Swift concert, Lady Starmer, nee Victoria Alexander, has sought to avoid public appearances Asked on LBC about his wife's low profile, Sir Keir pointed out that she had a full-time job at an NHS hospital and that their eldest child was doing his GCSEs. “We took the decision that whilst I was out and about on the road, we wanted to create the environment where he could study calmly in ordinary circumstances.” However, now that Sir Keir has won the election and become prime minister, Lady Starmer may find it trickier to shun the spotlight.\n\nPA Up until now, Lady Starmer has only occasionally appeared on big public and ceremonial occasions\n\nWhen she first met Sir Keir in the early 2000s, he wasn't a politician but a barrister. She was a solicitor working on the same case. Sir Keir told ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories, of their first meeting: \"I was doing a case in court and it all depended on whether the documents were accurate. \"I [asked the team] who actually drew up these documents, they said a woman called Victoria, so I said 'let's get her on the line.'\" He grilled her forensically on the paper but as he hung up he heard one comment from her. \"She said, 'who the bleep does he think he is', then put the phone down on me,\" Sir Keir said. \"And quite right too.\"\n\nKeir Starmer/Tom Baldwin The couple got engaged just a few months after meeting\n\nDespite the rocky beginnings, the relationship blossomed after a first date in the Lord Stanley pub in Camden, north London. Speaking to his biographer Tom Baldwin, Sir Keir described her as \"grounded, sassy, funny, streetwise - and utterly gorgeous too\". He proposed just a few months later on a holiday in Greece. \"Won't we need a ring, Keir?\" was her down-to-earth response. They were married in 2007 at the Fennes estate in Essex, walking down the aisle to one of Sir Keir's favourite pieces of music - Beethoven's Piano Concerto No.5, 2nd movement. He later described her to Radio 4's Desert Island Discs as an \"incredibly warm, wonderful woman. My complete rock\". The couple have two teenage children - but have been at pains to keep them out of the limelight - making a point of not naming them in public.\n\nKeir Starmer/Tom Baldwin The newly-weds with Sir Keir's parents, Rodney and Josephine Starmer\n\nLady Starmer grew up in north London, not far from where she currently lives with her family. She attended Channing School before studying law and sociology at Cardiff University. While there, she got involved in student politics, becoming president of the student union in 1994. In an interview with the student newspaper Gair Rhydd, she said her main priority was to campaign against cuts to student grants. Rob Watkins was at Cardiff University at the same time and worked as a photographer for the paper. He remembers the future Lady Starmer as being \"witty and professional, clearly dedicated to her work\" and aware of her responsibility to the people she represented.\n\nRob Watkins/ Alamy Lady Starmer got involved in student politics during her university years",
        "Japan declares victory in 'war' on floppy disks\n\nFloppy disks fell out of fashion in the 1990s as more efficient storage solutions were invented\n\nIt's taken until 2024, but Japan has finally said goodbye to floppy disks.\n\nUp until last month, people were still asked to submit documents to the government using the outdated storage devices, with more than 1,000 regulations requiring their use.\n\nBut these rules have now finally been scrapped, said Digital Minister Taro Kono.\n\nIn 2021, Mr Kono had \"declared war\" on floppy disks. On Wednesday, almost three years later, he announced: \"We have won the war on floppy disks!\"\n\nMr Kono has made it his goal to eliminate old technology since he was appointed to the job. He had earlier also said he would \"get rid of the fax machine\".\n\nOnce seen as a tech powerhouse, Japan has in recent years lagged in the global wave of digital transformation because of a deep resistance to change.\n\nFor instance, workplaces have continued to favour fax machines over emails - earlier plans to remove these machines from government offices were scrapped because of pushback.\n\nThe announcement was widely-discussed on Japanese social media, with one user on X, formerly known as Twitter, calling floppy disks a \"symbol of an anachronistic administration\".\n\n\"The government still uses floppy disks? That's so outdated... I guess they're just full of old people,\" read another comment on X.\n\nOthers comments were more nostalgic. “I wonder if floppy disks will start appearing on auction sites,” one user wrote.\n\nCreated in the 1960s, the square-shaped devices fell out of fashion in the 1990s as more efficient storage solutions were invented.\n\nA three-and-a-half inch floppy disk could accommodate up to just 1.44MB of data. More than 22,000 such disks would be needed to replicate a memory stick storing 32GB of information.\n\nSony, the last manufacturer of the disks, ended its production in 2011.\n\nAs part of its belated campaign to digitise its bureaucracy, Japan launched a Digital Agency in September 2021, which Mr Kono leads.\n\nBut Japan's efforts to digitise may be easier said than done.\n\nMany Japan businesses still require official documents to be endorsed using carved personal stamps called hanko, despite the government's efforts to phase them out.\n\nPeople are moving away from those stamps at a \"glacial pace\", said local newspaper The Japan Times.\n\nAnd it was not until 2019 that the country's last pager provider closed its service, with the final private subscriber explaining that it was the preferred method of communication for his elderly mother.",

        "Could the 'flying piano' help transform air cargo?\n\n1 day ago By Michael Dempsey , Technology Reporter Share\n\nAerolane Dubbed the \"flying piano\", Aerolane's test aircraft is surfing air currents\n\nUS start-up Aerolane is seeking the secret to airborne surfing. Geese already know how to do it. When you see them flying in a v-formation, they are surfing on the air currents created by formation members ahead and around them. At an airfield in Texas, Todd Graetz is hoping to use that concept to disrupt the market for air cargo. Aerolane has been mimicking the tricks used by migrating birds, aided by modified planes towed into the air by another aircraft. Smoke released from the leading plane allowed cameras installed in the towed aircraft to capture vortices in the air that a glider can exploit to stay aloft. Their latest test aircraft is known as the “flying piano” because of its poor gliding characteristics. Its twin engines idle for electrical power while it glides along with propellers turning for purely aerodynamic purposes. Other tests have measured the tension in the towing line. They spotted when the line went slack, indicating the glider is surfing along on currents generated by the aircraft ahead.\n\nAerolane's plan is to feed all this data into a program that will guide an unmanned cargo plane through wakes and turbulence to exploit the possibilities of gliding long distances without burning fuel. One or more such cargo planes could be towed by a jet, also carrying cargo, to their destination where they would land autonomously. The only fuel costs would come from supplying the towing aircraft’s engines. In theory this should work like a truck pulling a trailer, with air currents doing much of the heavy lifting. This is what Mr Graetz calls “a combination of gliding and surfing”. The same idea occurred to Airbus, which tested the technique in 2021 with two A350 airliners flying 3km (1.9 miles) apart across the Atlantic. Although the aircraft were not connected by a tow line, the experiment saw one aircraft winning an uplift from the lead A350’s wake to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel burn.\n\nAirbus Airbus has experimented with flying a jet in the wake of another to conserve fuel\n\nMr Graetz, a pilot with 12 years’ experience, founded Aerolane with Gur Kimchi, a veteran of Amazon’s drone delivery project, on the basis that “there has got to be a better way to get more out of existing aircraft\". The project has raised eyebrows among experienced pilots. Flying large gliders in commercial airspace means meeting strict flight safety regulations. For instance, the towing aircraft has to be confident it can release the tow line at any point in the flight, safe in the knowledge that the auto-piloted glider can make it down to a runway without dropping on top of the local population. Aerolane says a small electric motor driving a propeller will act as a safety net on their cargo gliders, giving them enough juice to go around again if a landing looks wrong or to divert to another location close by.\n\nAerolane Aerolane hopes that a glider something like this might one day carry air freight\n\nMr Graetz counters that Aerolane employs active commercial pilots who are hard-headed about the practicalities of the project. “We’ve engaged outside advisors to be devil’s advocates,\" he adds. He says big freight businesses are interested in anything that allows them to cut the cost per delivery. On top of the cost of fuel, air freight firms also have to think about jet engine emissions and a shortage of pilots. James Earl, a former RAF helicopter pilot and aviation consultant, thinks Mr Graetz may just be onto something. “It stands to reason that gains can be had by slipstreaming and combining efforts in the sky. And any innovation in the cargo space is good.” However, he cautions that public acceptance of unpowered cargo flights over built-up areas is another thing entirely. “It should have a good gliding range to get to a landing spot in the event of a major failure by the tow plane. Whether that can be effectively communicated to the public is another matter though.”\n\nFred Lopez Fred Lopez was initially sceptical about Aerolane's prospects",
        "The seats won by fewer than 100 votes\n\n15 hours ago By Alix Hattenstone, Jonathan Fagg and Miguel Roca-Terry , BBC England Data Unit Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nHow much does my vote matter? Turns out, quite a lot. In this election, seven seats were won by fewer than 100 votes. That's up from just one seat in 2019 - when Sinn Fein’s Michelle Gildernew won Fermanagh and South Tyrone by 57 votes. But there have been smaller margins. In 1886, Conservative John Edmund Wentworth Addison drew with the Liberal candidate in Ashton-under-Lyne. He became an MP when the local mayor cast the deciding vote. Rules have changed since then, and no constituency came as close as that in 2024. But some candidates got in by the skin of their teeth.\n\nThe smallest majority of 2024\n\nIt was a tense night for the candidates in Hendon, the closest constituency of the 2024 election. Labour candidate David Pinto-Duschinsky had tried - and failed - to win the seat before. But this time he squeezed in with just 15 more votes than his closest rival. After a recount, he won with 15,855 votes. Ameet Jogia of the Conservatives had 15,840. This is not the smallest winning margin in modern times. Since World War Two, two seats have been won by just two votes each – once by the Liberal Democrats in 1997, and once by the Scottish National Party in 2017.\n\nThree recounts needed\n\nPeter Henley/BBC Votes in Poole were counted four times\n\nVeteran Tory MP Sir Robert Syms endured three recounts during an agonisingly long night in Poole, only to see his 27 years as an MP ended by 18 votes. He received 14,150 votes, just below the 14,168 for Labour's candidate Neil Duncan-Jordan. Peter Henley, the BBC’s political editor for the South of England, said the count went on so long that the press room had to be cleared for a morning art class – a nude life drawing session.\n\n'Morally wrong' candidate scrapes through\n\nConservative Party chairman Richard Holden's rivals had accused him of being \"parachuted into a safe seat\"\n\nBefore voting even began, there was controversy over Richard Holden standing as a candidate in Basildon and Billericay. Local Tory councillor Andrew Baggott had called it \"morally wrong\". \"Yes, he’s chairman of the party, but so what? What has he done for Basildon and Billericay? Nothing.\" Mr Holden's previous constituency of North West Durham, about 300 miles away, had been abolished under the constituency boundary review. He would ultimately win Basildon and Billericay with 12,905 votes, 20 more than Labour's Alex Harrison.\n\nMP at 22\n\nEmma Baugh/BBC Sam Carling, 22, will be one of the youngest MPs of this election\n\nAt 22 years old, Labour's Sam Carling beat a Conservative candidate who had been in the seat almost as long as he had been alive. He received 14,785 votes, just 39 more than Conservative Shailesh Vara, who had represented North West Cambridgeshire for almost two decades. Mr Carling called his victory over Mr Vara a “political earthquake”.\n\n'Mistakes'\n\nMel Stride told the BBC \"we now need to go away and rebuild our party\"\n\nIt was a night in which several high profile Conservatives were ousted. But former work and pensions secretary Mel Stride was one of the few who survived. He had represented Central Devon since its creation in 2010. In 2019 he won with a majority of 17,721. This time, his win wasn't quite so comfortable. He polled just 61 more votes than Labour's Ollie Pearson, who got 16,770. Mr Stride told the BBC: “There’s a clear message that we received from the public. \"We now need to go away and rebuild our party and think long and deeply about what has happened over the last 24 hours and get ourselves back in a position where we are the natural party of government.”\n\nSlashed majority\n\nConservative Party When elected in 2015, Alan Mak became the first MP of ethnic Chinese origin\n\nMel Stride isn't the only candidate who saw his majority slashed. Conservative Alan Mak first became MP for Havant in 2015 with a majority of 13,920. And that number kept on rising - until now. His majority fell from almost 22,000 votes in 2019, to just 92 in 2024. Mr Mak received 12,986 votes, just above Labour candidate Stefanie Harvey on 12,894.\n\nThe final seat in England\n\nElection nerds were waiting with bated breath for the final result in England to be announced, in South Basildon and East Thurrock. After a lengthy recount, it went to Reform UK's James Murdock. He received 12,178 votes, beating the Labour candidate by 98 and replacing Conservative Stephen Metcalfe. Mr Murdock has become the fifth Reform UK MP.\n\nWhich seats were the safest?\n\nIt's fair to say that some candidates were a bit more comfortable than others on election night. Labour’s Peter Dowd won Bootle with the largest majority of the election - 21,983 more than his closest rival. The second biggest majority was also a Labour one. Catherine West won Hornsey and Friern Barnet with a majority of 21,475. Former leader of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, won the third largest. He received 31,051 votes in Westmorland and Lonsdale – 21,472 more than the Conservatives in second place.",
        "General election 2024 in maps and charts\n\n14 hours ago By Data journalism team , BBC News Share\n\nBBC\n\nThe Labour Party has won a landslide majority in the 2024 general election. The party has taken 412 seats with a majority of 174, with one result yet to be declared. It is the worst Conservative result in terms of seats in history, with the party on 121. The Liberal Democrats have their highest tally since 1923, taking 71 seats. The SNP is on nine seats. Reform UK have five and Plaid Cymru and the Green Party have four each. Some 23 seats were won by other parties, all in Northern Ireland, and independent candidates. The biggest gap on record has emerged between the share of the vote won nationally by parties and the number of seats they have gained.\n\nVote share\n\nLabour gained over 200 seats but their vote share increased by less than two percentage points to 34%. The Conservatives saw their vote share plummet by 20 points to 24% and the party lost 251 seats. Reform are in third place by share of the vote on 14% but they found it difficult to convert votes into seats. The party has returned five MPs, including party leader Nigel Farage in Clacton. By contrast, the Liberal Democrats’ 12% vote share translated into 71 seats. The Greens recorded their best ever general election performance, winning four seats and seven per cent of the vote.\n\nChanged hands\n\nThis map shows the seats which have been won by a different party to the last general election. To see all the results use the \"Changed hands\" toggle.\n\nAll of the new seats Keir Starmer's party took came from constituencies won by either the SNP or the Tories at the last general election. A total of 182 seats changed from blue to red. All of Reform's gains came from seats previously won by the Conservative Party in 2019. Labour lost five seats to independent candidates, including former party leader Jeremy Corbyn in Islington North. Labour also lost one seat, Leicester East, to the Conservatives and Bristol Central to the Greens.\n\nShare by constituency\n\nThe Conservative vote share suffered particularly in areas where high numbers voted to leave the European Union, falling by 27 points in constituencies where more than 60% voted Leave. Labour support in constituencies with large Muslim communities fell about 23 points to 39%. Click through the slides on these maps to see constituency vote share by party.\n\nScotland\n\nScotland is the only part of the UK where Labour’s vote share rose sharply. It jumped by 17 points as the party took 36 seats from the SNP. The SNP share of the vote is down 15 points. They also lost three seats to the Liberal Democrats. The leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Douglas Ross, lost his seat in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East.\n\nWales\n\nThe Conservatives lost 12 seats in Wales, meaning they now have no MPs there. Labour gained nine seats, taking the party's total to 27, despite their share falling by four points. Plaid Cymru has gained two seats, putting the party on four and the Liberal Democrats have taken one seat.\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nSinn Féin has become Northern Ireland's largest Westminster party, winning all seven seats it won in 2019, while the Democratic Unionist Party lost three of the eight it held at the last general election. In a surprise result, Traditional Unionist Voice took North Antrim from the DUP, unseating Ian Paisley Jr.\n\nRegional change\n\nLooking at seat and vote share change across broad areas of England, the Conservatives have lost more than 100 seats in the South excluding London and their vote share is down by about 24 points. Labour has made seat gains in the Midlands, North and South and has also increased its already-strong London tally by seven seats. The Liberal Democrats have increased their seats in the South by more than 40, their highest regional tally. Labour and Lib Dem vote shares fell somewhat in London, while hardly changing in the North and Midlands. Vote share for the two parties rose slightly in the South. Reform share is up in all of these broad regions.\n\nTurnout\n\nTurnout across the UK as a whole is 60%, the second lowest in a UK election since 1885. Only 2001 was lower with 59%.\n\nIt was lowest in Wales, where only 56% of the electorate voted. Northern Ireland had a turnout of 57%, Scotland 59% and England 60%. The lowest turnout of any constituency was 40% in Manchester Rusholme, where Afzal Khan held the seat for Labour. The bottom five for turnout also included Leeds South, Hull East, Blaenau Gwent & Rhymney and Tipton & Wednesbury.",
        "Sunak's 'dismal end' and 'bland' Starmer: World media reacts to UK election\n\n17 hours ago Share\n\nBBC\n\nBy BBC Monitoring and Matthew Davis\n\nThe Conservatives have emerged with \"broken bones\" from the UK election after Rishi Sunak's \"dismal end\" - but the big question for some in the international media is whether the \"bland, even boring\" Keir Starmer can clean up the UK's \"mess\". Labour's landslide victory is being digested by commentators all over the world, many dissecting what the results mean for relations with the UK - as well as for the future of the Conservative Party of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher. The rise of Reform UK also generates many international column inches of coverage, especially in Europe where it didn't go unnoticed that its leader, the arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage, became an MP for the first time.\n\nEurope: Centre-left success bucks a trend\n\nFor Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the results mean \"the British [have] had a burden lifted from their shoulders\", but any renewed stability in the UK is seen as fragile. Voters \"were primarily concerned with getting rid of the Conservatives,\" the paper says, adding that \"Labour has a stable majority, but also problems within the party\". German business daily Handelsblatt says the British election result \"opens up the opportunity to correct Brexit\". \"Now is the time to correct one of the biggest mistakes in British politics. A security pact with the EU can only be the beginning,\" the paper said. Mr Farage’s success attracted a lot of attention. German Tabloid Bild dubbed it an “election earthquake”, albeit one for which the paper says Labour can be thankful, seeing that Reform took many votes from the Conservatives. French media largely hails Labour’s victory, also noting the election of Nigel Farage. Le Figaro says that despite the Reform party leader’s success in Clacton, \"the British people have overwhelmingly chosen a moderate centre-left leader\". According to Le Monde, the UK’s return to the centre-left is \"striking, especially seen from France, where the far right has the wind in its sails on the eve of the second round of the legislative elections\". Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera says of the Conservative defeat: \"The party of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher emerges from this election with broken bones: it will take years to recover. Has the right-wing wind that blows across the continent stopped at the English Channel? Obviously not... If the person in charge disappoints, he is replaced.\" Conservative Italian daily Il Giornale hopes for a return to stability in the UK, calling Prime Minster Sir Keir Starmer “a reassuring institutional alternative”. But for Poland's national broadcaster TVP, Mr Starmer is seen as “a bit bland, even boring”. But fortunately for him, the broadcaster says, “previous leaders of the Conservative Party achieved much worse results”. In Hungary, the press there noted two issues: “Unchanged support for Ukraine”, according to pro-government paper Magyar Nemzet; and Hungarians in the UK hoping for “a more relaxed stance on visa rules and work permits,” said the left-wing paper Telex.\n\nUS sees 'frustrated' voters plump for 'dull competence'\n\nThe New York Times casts Labour's victory as \"a seismic moment in the UK’s politics, returning to power a party that just five years ago suffered its most crushing defeat since the 1930s\". But it also notes the low voter turnout, reporting only about 60% of those eligible cast ballots. \"The low figure speaks to the mood of an electorate that seemed frustrated with the last government but hardly full of optimism about the next one. It also pointed to the challenge facing the new Labour government, which will have to work fast if it wants to restore disillusioned voters’ faith in mainstream politics,\" the Times says. For ABC News, Rishi Sunak’s campaign to remain Britain’s prime minister showed a lack of political touch. \"Predecessors such as Tony Blair and Boris Johnson were more politically astute and able to connect with voters.\" As for Mr Sunak, he defied political advice by calling the election in May — \"with Conservative support dwindling steadily amid an economic slump, ethics scandals and a revolving door of leaders over the last two years,\" the broadcaster said. Meanwhile, a headline in the Wall Street Journal read: \"The UK elects a no-drama prime minister after years of post-Brexit chaos.\" \"Eight years after the UK voted to leave the European Union and entered an era of political and economic turmoil, voters have asked Keir Starmer to steady the entire country with his brand of dull competence,\" the paper said.\n\nIndia: 'Dismal end' for Sunak\n\nBy Rupsha Mukherjee\n\nMost TV channels and news sites in India focused on Rishi Sunak conceding defeat. “British Indians Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman win seats, but apologise for poor Tory performance,” The Times of India noted. The Wire website called it \"a dismal end to his 20 months as head of government\". Everything Sunak tried during the campaign “really failed”, Times Now TV added. “Everyone thought the Conservatives had a plan but now all those plans have fallen flat.\" But the Labour win “is also a triumph for India”, one news site thought, suggesting that Sir Keir Starmer would seek better relations with Delhi.\n\nChina: 'Can Starmer clean up UK's mess?'\n\nBy Kerry Allen, BBC Monitoring China team\n\nChina’s only official statement so far has been via its foreign ministry, which said China “had noticed the results of the British election” and “we hope to get Sino-UK relations along the right track”. Despite these hopes, state media outlets were not overly optimistic. “With six prime ministers in eight years, can Starmer clean up the UK’s mess?” asked broadcaster CCTV. Given the next government faces “the most challenging issues in 70 years”, “public dissatisfaction” might soon follow, mused The Paper. The Global Times, however, published a positive profile of the prime minister-to-be, saying Sir Keir was “not the inflammatory politician that people imagine”, and that media impressions of him are that he is “conscientious, good at management, and a little dull”. China can hope for a more pragmatic relationship with the UK, the paper said.\n\nRussia: No change in policy expected\n\nBy Anastasia Bazenkova and Yuriy Martynenko",

The crews worked really hard throughout the night. They were able to hold it.”\n\nThe city of Oroville, near where the Thompson fire started, cancelled its Independence Day fireworks, and warned residents to avoid using them and risking another blaze.\n\n“The last thing we need is somebody who’s purchased fireworks from a local fire stand going out and doing something stupid,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said. “Don’t be an idiot, cause a fire and create more problems for us.”\n\nMr Honea said the area had seen four fires within the last couple of weeks and cautioned that danger was far from over.\n\n“This is a bad fire season,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, a man has been accused of sparking a fire that triggered evacuations in the Clear Lake area earlier this month.\n\nThe man is faces charges related to negligent fire starts.

        "Tories mull next steps after election drubbing\n\nJust now By Paul Seddon , Political reporter Share\n\nPA Media\n\nConservatives leadership hopefuls are pondering how to react, after a crushing election defeat looks set to define the future direction of the party. The party now has only 121 MPs, down 251, after its vote collapsed as Labour achieved a landslide election victory. Rishi Sunak has vowed to stay on as leader until arrangements for selecting his successor are in place. None of the party's surviving MPs have yet confirmed they will run in the eventual contest to replace him, for which a timetable is not yet clear. Party grandees are expected to meet next week to decide the process by which the party will choose the next leader. But a debate is already simmering within its ranks over whether it should move to the right to win over the 4.1m voters who backed Reform UK.\n\n'Take our time'\n\nAmong those tipped to run are Suella Braverman, who at the eve of polls compared Tory figures attacking Mr Farage to a \"patient berating the doctor for the illness\". Speaking to reporters outside her home on Saturday morning, she said she had \"no announcements\" when asked whether she would run. \"We’ve just got to take our time, we’ve got to figure out what the situation is,” she said, adding the party had suffered a \"really bad result\". Others mentioned as possible leadership contenders include former ministers Kemi Badenoch, James Cleverly, and Tom Tugendhat. The pool of potential candidates has been reduced by the Tories' disastrous election performance, with mooted contenders Grant Shapps and Penny Mordaunt among dozens of ministers losing their seats. Two-time previous candidate Jeremy Hunt, who served as Mr Sunak's chancellor, is reportedly not thinking of running again.\n\nVeteran MP Sir Edward Leigh, who was re-elected in Gainsborough, said the party should invite Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to join the party. He told BBC Look North the Tories had been \"completely trashed in this election because the right wing vote is divided\". He added that the party needed to court Reform voters \"otherwise in five years' time, we’re going to have a similar debacle\". But former cabinet minister Damian Green, who lost his Ashford seat to Labour, said welcoming Mr Farage would be “utterly disastrous”. He said doing so would see the Tories \"lose millions of votes\" on the other end of its voter coalition, adding: \"You can’t just add the Reform vote to the Tory vote. \"We’ve got to win a lot of those voters back, but we do that by demonstrating competence, and having policies that will appeal to them, but within a broad conservative framework,” he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\n'Small C conservatives'",

        "Fake police scammers convinced me I was on China's 'most wanted' list\n\n3 hours ago By Elaine Chong and Ed Main , BBC Trending Share\n\nBBC Helen Young was targeted by scammers who posed as Chinese police officers\n\nChinese people around the world are being targeted by an elaborate scam in which criminals pretend to be Chinese police. A British-Chinese woman has told the BBC that she handed over her life savings to con men who wore uniforms in video calls and gave her a virtual tour of what appeared to be a police station.\n\nHelen Young still has nightmares about the fortnight that she was made to believe she was on China’s most wanted list. Scammers posing as Chinese police manipulated the London-based accountant into believing she was under investigation for a massive fraud back in her homeland. Helen was presented with a mountain of fabricated evidence which appeared to implicate her in a crime she knew nothing about. When the fake police then threatened her with extradition to a jail cell in China, Helen sent them her £29,000 life savings as “bail money”, in a desperate attempt to stay in Britain. “I feel a bit stupid right now,” she says. “But there's no chance I can know that's not real. It's so convincing”. Helen’s story may sound extraordinary but there have been numerous similar cases in the Chinese diaspora. China’s embassies around the world have issued public warnings about police impersonation scams, as has the FBI after a number of cases in the US. One elderly woman in Los Angeles reportedly handed over $3m, believing it would stop her extradition.\n\nThe FBI and Chinese embassies around the world have issued warnings about police impersonation scams\n\nTypically these scams begin with the target receiving a relatively innocuous phone call. In Helen’s case it was somebody claiming to be a Chinese customs officer who told her they had stopped an illegal parcel sent in her name. Helen hadn’t sent anything, and she was told she must file a police report if she believed someone had stolen her identity. Although she was sceptical, Helen didn’t hang up. “Chinese people like myself because we were born and bred in China, we were taught obedience,” she says. “So when the party asked me to do something or my parents asked me it’s very rare that I will say no.” Helen was transferred to a man who said he was a policeman in Shenzhen called “Officer Fang”. Helen asked for proof and he suggested they went on a video call. When they connected, Helen saw a uniformed man whose face matched the police ID he flashed. Officer Fang then used his phone to give her a tour of what looked like a fully functioning police station with several uniformed officers and a desk with a large police logo. “That moment all my suspicions are gone. So I say: 'I'm sorry, I just have to be careful nowadays, there are a lot of criminals out there',” Helen says. While they were talking, Helen heard a message on the tannoy in the background, telling Officer Fang to take a call about her. Officer Fang put her on hold and when he returned he was no longer interested in the illegal parcel. He said he had been informed that Helen was suspected of involvement in a large financial fraud.\n\n“I said: 'That’s nonsense'. He said: 'Nobody says they’re guilty. So it’s the evidence that counts'.” Helen was shown what looked like a bank statement for a vast amount of money in her name. Officer Fang told her that if she was innocent she must help them catch the real crooks. He made her sign a confidentiality agreement promising not to tell anyone about the investigation. Helen was warned that if she did, she would get an extra six months in prison “He said: 'If you tell anyone you have been interviewed by the Chinese police, your life will be in danger'.” The scammers also made Helen download an app so they could listen in to what she was doing day and night. Over the next few days, Helen tried to act normally at work. She spent her evenings working on a personal statement that she was ordered to write, detailing every aspect of her life. Then Officer Fang called back with the news that several suspects were now in custody. He showed her written statements in which several people accused her. Helen was sent a video which appeared to show a male prisoner confessing to police, and naming her as his boss in the fraud.\n\nHelen's scammers used a personalised video confession to convince her she was facing criminal charges\n\nWe have taken a closer look at the video, and because the suspect is wearing a large Covid mask, it’s impossible to tell if what you’re hearing matches his lip movements. It would be easy to add a fake soundtrack that mentions Helen's name or another victim. But for Helen - who had been convinced she was dealing with genuine police officers - the effect was devastating: “After I heard my name like that I was vomiting. It convinced me I was in deep, deep trouble.” Helen believed Officer Fang when he then told her she would be extradited to China - even though she’s a British citizen. “He told me: 'So you got 24 hours, you pack your bags. The police are coming to take you to the airport'.” Helen was told she could halt her extradition if she could raise bail. After sending over her bank statements for inspection, she was told to transfer £29,000. “I felt terrible, because I promised my daughter to give her money for her first flat,” Helen says. But a few days later the fake police were back. Helen was ordered to find another £250,000 or be extradited: “I was fighting for my life - if I go back to China, I may never come back.” After Helen tried to borrow the money from a friend, he alerted her daughter. Helen broke down and revealed everything. But not before she had put her phone in a kitchen drawer and taken her daughter into a bedroom, and put a duvet over their heads so the scammers couldn’t listen in. Her daughter listened patiently and explained it was a scam. Helen’s bank eventually refunded her money, but her ordeal could easily have had a bleaker ending: “For two weeks I hardly slept. How can you sleep when somebody is monitoring your phone?\" In her sleep-deprived state, she crashed her car twice. On the second occasion, she wrecked it entirely: “I didn’t kill anyone, but I could have. These types of criminal scam could kill people.” Other victims of police impersonation scams have been pushed to even greater extremes. In some extraordinary cases, some Chinese foreign students who can’t meet the financial demands of the fake police have been persuaded to fake their own kidnappings in order to seek a ransom from their families. Detective Superintendent Joe Doueihi of New South Wales Police fronted a publicity campaign to warn about so-called virtual or cyber-kidnappings, after a series of cases in Australia. “Victims are coerced into making their own video of them being in a vulnerable position, to appear as if they've been kidnapped - tied up with tomato sauce on their body to make it look like they've been bleeding, and calling for help from their loved ones,” he says.\n\nNew South Wales Police Police in Australia have issued warnings after a spate of 'virtual kidnappings'\n\nThe students are then ordered to isolate themselves while the scammers send these images to families back in China, with a ransom demand. The scam victims may also find themselves being manipulated into helping to scam others. “Scammers will trick a victim into believing that they are working for the Chinese government. They will send them documentation and swear them in as a Chinese police officer,” Det Supt Doueihi says. He says the victim - who may have already handed over money to the criminals - is sent to monitor or intimidate other Chinese students in Australia.\n\nThe BBC found AI filters which could help scammers mimic police, for sale online\n\nMany of these frauds are thought by experts to be run by Chinese organised crime groups operating from compounds in countries like Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos. Chinese state media has reported that tens of thousands of suspects have been returned to China over the last year. Awareness of these types of scams is growing. We spoke to a student in Japan who realised he was being targeted by criminals, and recorded their conversation. He asked not to be named, but shared the recording with the BBC. In it, the scammers tell him that if he revealed anything about the call to anyone, then he would be jeopardising the \"investigation\". He refused to hand over any money and they stopped pursuing him. He’s aware that he had a lucky escape: \"I never thought it would happen to me. Just be really careful when you get a call from a number that you don't recognise.”",
        "US jobs growth in June beats expectations\n\n21 hours ago Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nUS jobs growth slowed last month although the economy still created more posts than expected, official figures show. Employers added 206,000 jobs in June, while the number of jobs created in May was revised down to 218,000 from the previous estimate of 272,000. The US unemployment rate edged up to 4.1%, while wage growth rose at its slowest for three years. Analysts said the figures could take the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, a step closer to cutting rates later this year.\n\nEconomists had forecast that the US economy would add 190,000 jobs in June. Emily Bowerstock Hill, the chief executive of Bowerstock Capital Partners, said the figures were \"relatively benign\". \"The data isn't bad enough to alarm markets, and not bad enough to worry the Fed,\" she said. She added that the Fed has \"very clearly telegraphed they are expecting one cut\" this year. US interest rates were held again at 5.25%-5.5% in June, a range they have been in since July last year. In the minutes of the US central bank's latest meeting, which were published on Wednesday, policymakers acknowledged the economy appeared to be slowing and that \"price pressures were diminishing\".",

The new chancellor of the exchequer said she was inheriting a depleted economy from the Conservatives that would create a “challenge” for the new Labour government. “There’s not a huge amount of money there,” Ms Reeves told the BBC. “I know the scale of the challenge I inherit.” Ms Reeves said she would lean on the private sector to cover the shortfall. “Private-sector investment is the lifeblood of a successful economy. We need to unlock private-sector investment,” she said.\n\nSir Keir Starmer has become the UK's first Labour prime minister since 2010 after his party's landslide general election victory. Labour is returning to power with a huge parliamentary majority of 174, following a collapse in support for the Conservatives. Ms Reeves' comments on the economy come 14 years after Labour’s ex-Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Liam Byrne, left a note for his successor to say there was \"no money\" left when his party lost power in 2010. The note, which Mr Byrne later said was a joke, read: \"Dear Chief Secretary, I'm afraid there is no money. Kind regards - and good luck! Liam.\"",
        "Amazon at 30: What next for 'The Everything Company'?\n\n23 hours ago By Tom Singleton , Technology reporter Share\n\nAmazon\n\nThree decades on from the day it began, it is hard to get your head around the scale of Amazon. Consider its vast warehouse in Dartford, on the outskirts of London. It has millions of stock items, with hundreds of thousands of them bought every day - and it takes two hours from the moment something is ordered, the company says, for it to be picked, packed and sent on its way. Now, picture that scene and multiply it by 175. That's the number of \"fulfilment centres\", as Amazon likes to call them, that it has around the world. Even if you think you can visualise that never-ending blur of parcels crisscrossing the globe, you need to remember something else: that's just a fraction of what Amazon does. It is also a major streamer and media company (Amazon Prime Video); a market leader in home camera systems (Ring) and smart speakers (Alexa) and tablets and e-readers (Kindle); it hosts and supports vast swathes of the internet (Amazon Web Services); and much more besides. \"For a long time it has been called 'The Everything Store', but I think, at this point, Amazon is sort of 'The Everything Company',\" Bloomberg's Amanda Mull tells me. \"It's so large and so omnipresent and touches so many different parts of life, that after a while, people sort of take Amazon's existence in all kinds of elements of daily life sort of as a given,\" she says. Or, as the company itself once joked, pretty much the only way you could get though a day without enriching Amazon in some way was by \"living in a cave\".\n\nGetty Images Amazon has used sport to grow its streaming business\n\nSo the story of Amazon, since it was founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, has been one of explosive growth, and continual reinvention. There has been plenty of criticism along the way too, over \"severe\" working conditions and how much tax it pays. But the main question as it enters its fourth decade appears to be: once you are The Everything Company, what do you do next? Or as Sucharita Kodali, who analyses Amazon for research firm Forrester, puts it: \"What the heck is left?\" \"Once you're at a half a trillion dollars in revenue, which they already are, how do you continue to grow at double digits year over year?\" One option is to try to tie the threads between existing businesses: the vast amounts of shopping data Amazon has for its Prime members might help it sell adverts on its streaming service, which - like its rivals - is increasingly turning to commercials for revenue. But that only goes so far - what benefits can Kuiper, its satellite division, bring to Whole Foods, its supermarket chain? To some extent, says Sucharita Kodali, the answer is to \"keep taking swings\" at new business ventures, and not worry if they fall flat. Just this week Amazon killed a business robot line after only nine months - Ms Kodali says that it is just one of a \"whole graveyard of bad ideas\" the company tried and discarded in order to find the successful ones. But, she says, Amazon may also have to focus on something else: the increasing attention of regulators, asking difficult questions like what does it do with our data, what environmental impact is it having, and is it simply too big? All of these issues could prompt intervention \"in the same way that we rolled back the monopolies that became behemoths in the early 20th century\", Ms Kodali says. For Juozas Kaziukėnas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, its size poses another problem: the places its Western customers live in simply can not take much more stuff. \"Our cities were not built for many more deliveries,\" he tells the BBC. That makes emerging economies like India, Mexico and Brazil important. But, Mr Kaziukėnas, suggests, there Amazon does not just need to enter the market but to some extent to make it. \"It's crazy and maybe should not be the case - but that's a conversation for another day,\" he says.\n\nGetty Images Shein and Temu are two of the brands from China that are competing with Amazon",
        "Etsy sex toy ban sparks seller outrage\n\nSex toys and many other erotic items are to be banned from online marketplace Etsy - sparking a backlash from sellers.\n\nAlso prohibited from 29 July will be items which - when modelled - expose body parts such as female nipples or the cleft between the buttocks.\n\nEtsy - which focusses on handmade, vintage and craft items - said new rules on sales were being introduced because of \"evolving industry standards.\"\n\nAffected sellers have told the BBC they feel let down by the policy change, which they predict will cause their revenues to plummet.\n\n\"As creators who have helped make Etsy what it is and who have remained loyal to their platform for years, we feel betrayed,\" said Anna (who preferred not to use her surname), founder of Simply Elegant Glass, which makes sex toys.\n\nEtsy says the ban is about keeping users safe and reflects industry-wide trends.\n\n\"We carefully crafted this policy with the goal of continuing to enable creative expression and the spirit of our marketplace, while taking into account evolving industry standards,\" Etsy's Alice Wu Paulus wrote announcing the changes.\n\nIn many countries there is pressure on platforms, sometimes backed by new legislation, to do more to prevent under-18s from encountering explicit content, and to remove illegal or \"harmful\" content from their platforms.\n\nPayment processors are also increasingly wary of working with platforms that enable sex based commerce.\n\nBut Anna suggested those concerns could be addressed by more clearly labelling and separating adult product listings on Esty, which she accused of \"forsaking content-filtering tools in favour of blanket bans\".\n\nShe also defended the products she made, saying she had focussed on making adult glass products since 2015 - having learnt glass-blowing 18 years ago - \"as a means of artistic expression\".\n\nAnna said a significant portion of Simply Elegant Glass' orders were generated through Etsy, and migrating to another platform, like Shopify, felt like \"starting anew\".\n\nThe business has posted an open letter to Etsy on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nA Czech Republic-based seller of premium silicone sex toys - who did not supply their name - said many businesses who relied on Etsy would see a \"significant drop in income\".\n\n\"This means that many people have just 30 days to find a new job because the self-driven traffic to a standalone website may not be sufficient,\" the seller told the BBC.\n\nFor those forced to look for jobs, finding alternative employment would be tricky as \"putting a 'sex toy business' on the resume when seeking employment may close the doors to many employers\" the seller said.\n\nMike Stabile of the Free Speech Coalition - a campaign group that defends the rights of the adult industry - accused Etsy of rolling out \"sweeping sitewide censorship\" in a post on X.\n\nBut some sellers were glad of the changes - voicing support on Etsy forums - though they also had questions over how the new rules will be enforced.",
        "Brazil blocks Meta from using social media posts to train AI\n\nA Meta spokesperson told the BBC the company was \"disappointed by the decision\", adding that their approach complied with local privacy laws.\n\nOn Tuesday, Brazil's national data protection agency (ANPD) said it would immediately suspend Meta's latest privacy policy, which allows it to train generative AI models such as chatbots based on posts from its users.\n\nIt comes weeks after the company abandoned similar plans to use UK and European users' posts for the same purpose.\n\nBrazil has blocked Meta from using Brazilians' Instagram and Facebook posts to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models.\n\n\"This is a step backwards for innovation, competition in AI development and further delays bringing the benefits of AI to people in Brazil,\" the company added.\n\nMeta has a significant market in Brazil. There are 102 million Facebook users and more than 113 million Instagram users in the country.\n\nThe ANPD said it had acted over the \"imminent risk of serious and irreparable damage, or difficulty repairing fundamental rights of the affected [account] holders\".\n\nMeta was given five working days from ANPD's decision to show it has amended its privacy policy to exclude the use of personal information found in public posts to train generative AI. If it fails to comply it will face a daily fine of R$50,000 (£6,935).\n\nThe company's updated policy was also the focus of scrutiny in the UK and the European Union (EU).\n\nUnder its privacy policy changes, which were due to take effect in the region on 26 June, Meta users' information would be used to \"develop and improve\" its AI products.\n\nIn Europe, the policy change would include posts, images, image captions, comments and Stories that users over the age of 18 had shared with a public audience on Facebook and Instagram, but not private messages.\n\nBut that was put on hold after Meta said it had received a request from the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) on behalf of other European stakeholders to delay its training of large language models (LLMs).\n\nLLMs are a type of artificial intelligence that powers chatbots, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.\n\nOn 14 June, when it announced the delay, Meta said this was a \"step backwards\" for AI in Europe.\n\nHowever Meta decided to press ahead with the policy change in Brazil.\n\nPedro Martins, from Data Privacy Brasil, welcomed the ANPD's decision. He told the BBC there was a discrepancy between Meta's data protection measures for its Brazilian and European users.\n\nMeta had planned to use posts from Brazilian children and teenagers to train its AI models, he said, while in Europe nobody under 18 would have their posts used.\n\nBrazil's data protection regulator also found that personal data found in children and teenagers' posts could be collected and used to train Meta's AI systems, which could be in breach of the country's data protection law.\n\nIn addition, Mr Martins said, in Europe the steps users can take to prevent Meta from using personal information are more straightforward than in Brazil, where he said it can take as many as eight steps for users to block the company from using their posts.\n\nThe BBC has asked Meta to respond to the claim that it had planned to use posts from Brazilian children and teenagers to train its AI models, and whether it imposed more onerous steps for opting out on users in Brazil.",

        "Diddy faces new sexual assault case\n\nEmbattled rapper Sean \"Diddy\" Combs is facing another sexual assault case after a woman came forward with fresh accusations against him.\n\nThe complaint filed him in New York by former porn star Adria English is the latest of several lawsuits filed against the star in recent months.\n\nMr Combs, who is one of rap's most successful moguls, has consistently denied all allegations of sexual assault and physical abuse, including the latest ones.\n\nThe star is now reportedly also the subject of a federal criminal investigation, though there is no sign any charges are imminent, according to NBC News.\n\nMr Combs's legal woes have mounted after accusations made by ex-girlfriend Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura in November. Earlier this year, he apologised after footage came to light that showed him attacking Ms Ventura in a hotel hallway in 2016.\n\nThe new case against in New York alleges that Mr Combs \"forced and coerced (Ms English) to engage in sex work for him\" at parties. It also alleges that the rapper threatened to ruin her career if she did not comply.\n\nA total of 33 allegations are made against Mr Combs and his associates in Ms English's 114-page filing, which gives an account of events between 2004 and 2009.\n\n“No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won’t change the fact that Mr Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone,” his lawyer told US media.\n\nThe statement went on to say that \"Mr Combs is confident he will prevail against these and other baseless claims in court”.\n\nMs English is the latest in a string of women to make claims against Mr Combs in recent months, following a lawsuit launched by Ms Ventura that was settled by Mr Combs in November for an undisclosed sum.\n\nShe had accused him of rape and sexual trafficking over a decade.

The invention was thought up by Matthew Gardiner, a consultant hand and plastic surgeon at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough, Berkshire. Traditionally, patients had to lie flat during surgery, which many found challenging. But the prototype, costing almost £8,000, enables people to sit up and place their hand on the table while the procedure is carried out.\n\nFrimley Health NHS Foundation Trust Other hospitals across the UK are now piloting the invention\n\nMr Gardiner, who is also associate medical director for research at Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust, said patient comfort and safety were the main drivers behind the idea. \"Many have conditions that make lying flat very difficult and uncomfortable,\" he said. \"Some ended up having general anaesthesia only because they couldn’t tolerate lying flat whilst awake.” The prototype, which was trialed at Heatherwood Hospital in Ascot, saw patients able to sit up and read while their operations were carried out. Many chose to watch their surgeries, although the table’s design includes a screen option for those who would rather not.\n\nLightweight and simple\n\nThe invention was one of the successful bids at last year’s CEO Change Challenge, the hospital trust’s annual competition which aims to get frontline staff more involved in delivering change. Mark Lee, product manager at Anetic Aid - the company that made the final product - said the team had to ensure the new table was lightweight and simple to use. “[Mr Gardiner] was looking to bring some efficiency to theatre time and increase the number of surgeries able to be performed during the day,” he added.

        "Fifty violent attacks shock France ahead of crunch vote\n\n1 day ago By Paul Kirby , BBC News in Paris Share\n\nREUTERS/Benoit Tessier Among those attacked were government spokeswoman Prisca Thevenot (R) and her deputy Virginie Lanlo\n\nMore than 50 candidates and activists in France have come under physical attack in the run-up to Sunday's tense final round of parliamentary elections, Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin has said. He revealed the figure after government spokeswoman Prisca Thevenot, her deputy Virginie Lanlo and a party activist were brutally assaulted as they put up election posters in Meudon, south-west of Paris. The motive for the attack is not clear, but Ms Thevenot returned to Meudon on Thursday with Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who condemned what he called \"attacks of intolerable cowardice\". The spate of assaults across France reflects the febrile mood on the final day of campaigning in an election that the far-right National Rally (RN) is poised to win.\n\nAlthough RN is well ahead in the polls, 217 candidates have dropped out from local run-off races so another candidate has a better chance of stopping them winning an outright majority in the National Assembly. Mr Darmanin told news channel BFMTV the attacks were taking place in a climate in which France was \"on edge\" and more than 30 people had been arrested. He said the attackers were either people who had \"spontaneously become angry\" or they were the \"ultra-left, ultra-right or other political groups\". Images filmed from a block of flats showed the youths swarming around the candidate, her deputy Virginie Lanlo and a party activist for President Emmanuel Macron's Ensemble alliance. Ms Thevenot told Le Parisien website that when she and her colleagues objected to the youths defacing party posters \"they immediately attacked one of my activists, injuring Virginie\". Ms Lanlo suffered an arm injury, while the activist was punched and hit with a scooter, ending up with a broken jaw. The car windscreen was also smashed by the scooter. Three teenagers and a man aged 20 were arrested by police and the incident was quickly condemned across the political spectrum. Mr Attal called on people to \"reject the climate of violence and hatred that's taking hold\", while RN leader Jordan Bardella said one of his \"big commitments as prime minister\" would be to \"combat record insecurity and repeat offending\".\n\nYOAN VALAT/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock National Rally head Marine Le Pen says there is still a chance of outright victory on Sunday\n\nMr Darmanin has announced that 30,000 police will be deployed across France for Sunday's vote in an attempt to prevent \"the ultra-left or ultra-right\" from stirring up trouble. The BBC spoke to voters in his constituency in northern France on Thursday who said they feared youths would go on the rampage whoever won, to express their anger at the political system. Law and order is one of RN's big priorities, alongside immigration and tax cuts to target the cost-of-living crisis. RN candidates have also come under attack. Marie Dauchy described being \"violently assaulted\" as she campaigned at a market in La Rochette near Grenoble in the south-east. A conservative candidate allied with RN, Nicolas Conquer, complained that he and a female colleague had been pelted with eggs. And last month another RN candidate was treated in hospital after he was set upon while handing out pamphlets.",

The constituency is expected to go to the Liberal Democrats - although the result will not be officially confirmed until the third count is completed. It started at 10:30 on Saturday. SNP candidate Drew Hendry has already conceded defeat. He said it had been \"an absolute joy\" to serve the people of Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey for the last nine years - and that he was disappointed not to be continuing as MP under the new Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire boundary.\n\nReuters Votes were counted across Scotland after the polls closed on Thursday night\n\nIt is expected that the seat will be won by Angus MacDonald of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. Mr MacDonald is present at the count in full highland dress. His SNP opponent, Mr Hendry is unable to attend the count on Saturday due to an \"unmovable commitment\". The outcome had originally been expected at about 05:00 on Friday, but there was a recount - then candidates were told the votes would need to be counted again on Saturday morning. Returning officer Derek Brown said the delay was due to a discrepancy between the verified votes total and the provisional number of counted votes.\n\nLabour won a landslide victory in Scotland with 37 seats – a gain of 36. The SNP, who won 48 seats in 2019, have been reduced to nine. The Scottish Conservatives have five seats but party leader Douglas Ross - who is standing down after the vote - lost out to the SNP in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East after controversially standing instead of a local candidate who had been ill. The Liberal Democrats are on five seats, which would rise to six if they win Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire. First Minister John Swinney has described the result, the SNP's worst since 2010, as \"very, very difficult and damaging\". He said the party would have to rebuild trust with the people of Scotland. In a phone call with new Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday evening, Mr Swinney committed to working cooperatively with the UK government on \"areas of mutual interest\". Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said it was a \"historic day\" and that the new Labour MPs would \"make decisions for the people of Scotland\". Mr Ross described it as a “deeply difficult campaign and result” for his party. He told BBC Reporting Scotland: “I don’t think we need any knee-jerk reaction that we may regret in the short to medium term.”",

Mr Gordon won the seat for the Liberal Democrats at the general election, defeating incumbent Conservative Andrew Jones. He told the BBC his mother was diagnosed the day before he started a Master of Public Health degree at Newcastle University. He said witnessing her plight showed there was \"not enough support there for people\".\n\n\"The day before I started my master's degree, my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer,\" Mr Gordon said. \"Fortunately she's fine and recovered now. \"She's even a councillor in Wakefield.\" Mr Gordon said he studied his degree part-time over two years, rather than one, so he could \"spend time at home and look after her and my little sister\". He added that he wanted to get into politics after seeing \"how people have to struggle or cope when they've got long-term or chronic life-threatening illness and the fact that there's not enough support there for people\". Following his degree, Mr Gordon went on to work in the scientific recruitment and health services research sector.\n\nKey priorities"

        "## Duo Euthanasia: Why a Happily Married Couple Decided to Die Together\n\nJan Faber (70) and Els van Leeningen (71) died together on June 3, 2024, after receiving lethal medication from two doctors in the Netherlands. This practice, known as duo-euthanasia, is legal but rare. Each year, more couples choose to end their lives together, citing unbearable suffering. \n\nJan, plagued by chronic back pain, and Els, suffering from dementia, decided to end their lives after years of living on boats and in their campervan. They had discussed euthanasia before, concerned about the quality of life they would face with their conditions. \n\n“If you take a lot of medicine, you live like a zombie,” Jan said in an interview with the BBC. “So, with the pain I have, and Els’ illness, I think we have to stop this.\"\n\nThe couple's decision to die together was not without controversy.  Some, like Dr. Theo Boer, professor of healthcare ethics, worry that the growing acceptance of duo-euthanasia is eroding the taboo on intentional killing. \"In the past year we’ve seen dozens of cases of duo-euthanasia, and there’s a general tendency to ‘hero-ify’ dying together,” said Dr. Boer. \n\nJan and Els' son, however, supported their decision, stating, \"There is no other solution.\"  The family shared a final dinner together the night before and listened to music as the doctors arrived. \n\nThe case of Jan and Els highlights the complex ethical issues surrounding end-of-life decisions, particularly for couples facing debilitating illnesses. \n",

Discussions are ongoing within the party, the White House, and the Biden-Harris campaign about a range of options, including a possible withdrawal of Biden's candidacy. \n\nDemocratic officials and political operatives express concerns about the president's stamina and mental fitness, raising questions about his capacity to compete with Donald Trump in November.  Some sources, including prominent political columnist David Ignatius and New York Times columnist Ezra Klein, have previously voiced concerns about Biden's age and called for him to step aside. Following the debate, these concerns have escalated, with high-profile Democrats calling for the president to consider withdrawing from the race.\n\nDespite this growing pressure, the decision ultimately rests with Biden himself. While some sources suggest the president's wife and sister may influence his decision, it is unlikely he would be removed from the ticket against his will.  \n\nThe situation remains fluid, with Biden's campaign team seeking to counter the negative narrative surrounding his recent performance. The president himself addressed concerns about his age at a rally in North Carolina, expressing his commitment to the role. However, the possibility of a change in his candidacy remains, with sources indicating a potential 5% chance of his stepping aside.  The next few weeks will be crucial in determining whether Biden can regain momentum or succumb to mounting pressure within his own party. \n",

Attal warned that an RN win would unleash “impulses of hate and aggression,” but the party led by Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella has solidified its lead in opinion polls.  \n\nThe RN, which has faced accusations of racism, could secure an absolute majority in the National Assembly after the second round of voting on July 7.  While opinion polls show the RN leading with 36.5% of the vote, the New Popular Front, a hastily assembled left-wing alliance, is trailing closely with 29%.

        "##  Can Biden be Replaced as Democrat Nominee? Who Could Replace Him?\n\nFollowing a less-than-stellar performance in the first 2024 presidential debate, questions are swirling around President Joe Biden's future as the Democratic nominee. Democratic sources report panic and confusion within the party, sparking discussions about whether the 81-year-old president should step aside. While the New York Times editorial board has called for Biden to withdraw, the question remains: could Biden be replaced?\n\nIf Biden chooses to withdraw, the party could easily replace him, according to political historian Leah Wright Rigueur.  The Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago will officially select the nominee from August 19-22, where delegates, largely pledged to Biden, would be free to choose a new candidate. However, Rigueur notes, \"If he were to get replaced, part of the negotiation for him stepping down would be that he would get the final say in who replaces him.\"\n\nForcing Biden out is unlikely. While DNC rules allow delegates to \"reflect the sentiments of those who elected them,\" experts doubt a revolt among delegates would occur. Replacing Biden would be a messy affair, with potential legal challenges from conservative groups, as well as an uncertain path to selecting a new nominee. \n\nWhile Vice President Kamala Harris would automatically take over if Biden withdrew during his presidency, the same rules don't apply in this scenario.  Harris would need to win the majority of delegates just like any other candidate. Other possible contenders include Minnesota congressman Dean Phillips, writer Marianne Williamson, and governors Gavin Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer, and Josh Shapiro.\n\nThe situation remains fluid, with Biden showing no sign of stepping down. However, the possibility of a new Democratic nominee is a significant development in the 2024 race. \n",

In a 6-3 decision along ideological lines, the court overturned a lower court ruling that had found the practice unconstitutional. The ruling, issued on Friday, is the court's most significant decision on homelessness since the 1980s. \n\nThe case stemmed from a lawsuit filed by three homeless individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, who received citations for sleeping and camping outside. The city argued that criminal penalties were necessary for public safety and cleanliness. Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing for the majority, stated that the city's regulations do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, as they focus on actions rather than the \"mere status\" of being homeless.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, in her dissenting opinion, countered that \"sleep is a biological necessity, not a crime.\"\n\nThe ruling has been met with mixed reactions. Some cities, including San Francisco, welcomed the decision, stating it will help them manage public spaces more effectively. However, advocates for the homeless, such as the National Alliance to End Homelessness, expressed concern that the ruling will harm those experiencing homelessness and push them further into the criminal justice system. \n\nThis decision comes as homelessness continues to rise in the US, with an estimated 653,000 people experiencing homelessness in 2023, the highest number since tracking began in 2007. \n",

        "South Africa's fragile coalition government is facing a major crisis just weeks after its formation, as President Cyril Ramaphosa accuses Democratic Alliance (DA) leader John Steenhuisen of trying to establish a \"parallel government.\" In a letter dated June 25, seen by local media, Mr. Ramaphosa alleges that the DA is breaking the terms of their coalition agreement. The letter was written after the DA rejected Mr. Ramaphosa's offer of six cabinet positions, demanding two more. Mr. Ramaphosa also criticized DA federal chairperson Helen Zille for \"offensive\" and \"inconsistent\" demands. This dispute has led to the DA threatening to withdraw from the coalition, citing the ANC's breach of their prior agreement, including the allocation of the Trade and Industry Ministry. The potential collapse of the coalition has sent shockwaves through South African markets, with the rand plunging against the dollar. The business sector, which had advocated for a strong coalition, is now expressing deep concern over the political instability. \n",
        "A new search for missing British teenager Jay Slater began on Saturday morning in Tenerife. The search, led by experienced local firefighters, police and mountain rangers, is focusing on the ravines and trails around the village of Masca in the Rural de Teno national park.  Authorities had hoped for a “massive search” but less than 12 members of the public had arrived at the meeting point before it began.\n\nMr. Slater, 19, has not been heard from since the morning of June 17th, after he told a friend he was lost in the mountains and had 1% battery on his phone. Police confirmed the search would be more extensive and detailed, covering areas previously explored. Volunteers included British climber and TikTok personality Paul Arnott, who has been searching on the island for the past week, and Tenerife local Livia Karczeysky, who said she was taking part because she too had a 19-year-old son.\n\nSince Mr. Slater disappeared, authorities have deployed helicopters, search dogs, and drones but no trace of him has been found. His mother, Debbie Duncan, previously told the BBC her son was on his first holiday abroad without parents. “He's just an all-round nice, bubbly guy with hundreds of friends who love being in his company,\" she said. \"He's gorgeous, he's beautiful.

        "Iran will hold a run-off presidential election on July 5 after neither Saeed Jalili nor Massoud Pezeshkian secured a majority in the first round, according to Iran's Interior Ministry. Jalili, a hardline candidate, and Pezeshkian, who is considered a reformist, both hovered around the 40% mark in the initial vote, with Pezeshkian narrowly ahead. This comes after a low voter turnout of approximately 40%, the lowest since the 1979 Islamic revolution. The election is to replace former president Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash in May. The run-off election is significant as it comes after a period of political turmoil and widespread protests in Iran. \n",

The ruling, in a case involving herring fishermen, was met with cheers from conservatives who have long sought to curtail the power of federal agencies.  \n\nThe Chevron deference, established in *Chevron v Natural Resources Defense Council*, allowed federal agencies to interpret ambiguous laws and fill in \"gaps\" in legislation. This gave agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency broad discretion in creating and implementing regulations.\n\nThe decision, however, has been met with strong criticism from liberals and advocacy groups, who see it as a blow to environmental safeguards and public health protections.  \"The court has set us on a path towards policy paralysis,\" said the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organisation.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision marks a significant shift in the balance of power between the judiciary and the executive branch.

He expressed frustration with the volume of legal queries and his desire to be \"over with\" the inquiry. \n\nThe inquiry continues to investigate the Post Office scandal and the impact it has had on sub-postmasters wrongly convicted due to errors in the Horizon system. \n",
        "Nike shares plummeted over 12% in after-hours trading on Thursday following the company's announcement of a surprise 10% drop in quarterly revenue. The decline, attributed to growing competition from upstart brands like On and Hoka, could result in a $15 billion loss in market value. Nike CEO John Donahoe cited weakening international demand, including in China, as a contributing factor.  However, he remains optimistic about the upcoming Paris Olympics as a platform for re-engaging consumers through new products and a targeted marketing campaign.  \"The Paris Olympics offers us a pinnacle moment to communicate our vision of sport to the world,\" Donahoe said.  Analysts like Neil Saunders of GlobalData Retail suggest that Nike's recent struggles stem from a lack of innovation and effective marketing, particularly in comparison to newer brands.  \"There's a sense that Nike just hasn't innovated enough, it hasn't marketed enough, it hasn't told enough stories around its products,\" Saunders told the BBC.  Nike's shift to a direct-to-consumer model, prioritizing its own stores and website over wholesale partnerships, has also contributed to the decline in sales, according to Reuters. The company's future success hinges on regaining its footing in the market and effectively communicating its value proposition to consumers. \n",

Videos circulating online show pillars supporting the roof crashing onto cars parked at Terminal 1. \n\n“While the cause for the collapse is being assessed, the primary cause seems to be the continued heavy rainfall over the past few hours,” said an airport spokesperson. All flights from Terminal 1 have been suspended until further notice. The incident has disrupted the travel plans of thousands, as most domestic flights operate from this terminal. \n\nIndia's aviation regulator has advised airlines to accommodate passengers on alternate flights or offer refunds.

The incident underscores the potential risks associated with extreme weather events and highlights the importance of robust infrastructure to withstand such challenges. \n",
        "## Glasgow says goodbye to old subway trains\n\nGlasgow's iconic subway system bid farewell to its 44-year-old trains on [date], as the last of the old-style carriages made their final journey around the underground loop. The city has been gradually phasing out the legacy trains since December, replacing them with modern, wheelchair-accessible vehicles.  \n\nThe two final trains, which have each clocked an estimated 2.6 million miles, were driven out for their last trips by Julie Baker, a veteran driver with 35 years of experience on the subway.  \"I'm actually emotional, but it's time to change,\" Baker said, adding that she had driven the trains almost their entire lifespan.  \n\nThe old trains were first introduced in 1980 as part of a modernization project, replacing the original 19th-century carriages.  One of the legacy trains has now been retired to Glasgow's Riverside Museum for display. The £288m upgrade program, which also includes platform doors and driverless trains, marks the third modernization of the subway since 2012. \n",

Network Rail is undertaking essential repairs to replace 40 degraded steel ropes that support the bridge. \n\nTrain operator Southeastern will run a bus replacement service between Sheerness and Sittingbourne during the closure.  \"It’s going to make things a lot more difficult while the line is shut as it makes journeys to work and school longer,\" said Sheerness resident John Bootes. \"I hope they have understanding bosses and teachers.\"  Angela Read, another resident, expressed similar concerns about the added commute time. \"I’ve got to travel for an extra hour while the bridge is closed,\" she said.  \"It’s annoying but it’s essential work that needs to be done, hopefully the line will run smoothly after that.\" \n\nNetwork Rail and Southeastern are urging passengers to plan ahead and allow additional travel time during the bridge closure. The bridge will also be closed from July 12th to 15th, and again from July 19th to 28th for further repairs. \n",

        "Three employees of HYBE Corporation, the agency behind K-pop sensation BTS, have been indicted on charges of insider trading. The charges, filed by South Korean prosecutors on June 14, 2022, allege the employees sold shares in HYBE prior to the announcement of BTS's hiatus, knowing the news would negatively impact the company's stock price. \n\nProsecutors claim the employees avoided losses ranging from $24,000 to over $108,000 by selling their shares before the news broke, which led to a 25% plunge in HYBE's stock value. The incident highlights the potential for insider trading in the entertainment industry and emphasizes the need for transparency and ethical conduct within agencies.  \n",
        "## India's Heatwave Drives Record Air Conditioner Sales\n\nThe unprecedented heatwave gripping India has spurred a surge in air conditioner sales, revealing a growing disparity in how people are coping with rising temperatures.  Govind Ram, a Delhi resident, recently purchased an air conditioner for his children, citing unbearable heat as the reason. “I’ve endured the worst summers under just a fan. But this year, my children suffered so much that I had to buy our family’s first air conditioner,” he said.\n\nAir conditioner sales are expected to see a 60% increase this summer, a sharp contrast to the usual 25-30% growth in previous years.  \"In my 45 years in the air-con industry, I've never seen anything like this,\" says B Thiagarajan, managing director of Blue Star.  \n\nDespite only 8% of Indian households owning air conditioners, India is the world's fastest-growing AC market. This surge is attributed to rising disposable incomes, increased aspirations, and a growing awareness of the need for climate control. However, experts warn that reliance on air conditioning could exacerbate existing inequalities.  A recent nationwide survey found that while only 1 in 8 four-wheeler owners felt uncomfortable in their homes during the heatwave, almost half of those without vehicles did.  The study highlighted the widening gap between wealthier households with access to cooling technologies and poorer households struggling with extreme temperatures.\n\nThe rising demand for air conditioning underscores the urgency for India to implement sustainable solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change. This includes revitalizing aquatic habitats, promoting energy-efficient buildings, and encouraging the use of cool roofs and chilled water systems. \n",
        "## Supreme Court Rejects Plan to Shield Sacklers in Purdue Opioid Deal\n\nThe US Supreme Court has struck down a key provision in the bankruptcy deal for Purdue Pharma, denying the Sackler family protection from future lawsuits related to their role in the opioid crisis. The Sacklers, owners of the OxyContin maker, had agreed to pay $6 billion towards a wider settlement in exchange for immunity from civil claims. \n\nHowever, the court ruled that granting such protections to the Sacklers, who did not themselves declare bankruptcy, was unauthorized under law. \"The Sacklers have not agreed to place anything approaching their full assets on the table for opioid victims,\" wrote Justice Neil Gorsuch, delivering the 5-4 majority opinion. \n\nThe ruling is a victory for the US government and others who argued that releasing the Sacklers would misuse the bankruptcy system.  Ellen Isaacs, whose son died from an overdose, expressed gratitude for the court's decision, stating, \"I'd like to see them held fully accountable.\"\n\nWhile the ruling throws the future of the settlement into question, it leaves open the possibility of holding the Sacklers liable for their role in the opioid epidemic, which has claimed over 80,000 lives annually since 1999. \n",

        "## Are Rainy Days Ahead for Cloud Computing?\n\nA growing number of companies are choosing to bring their data and workloads back from the cloud, a trend known as cloud repatriation. This shift is driven by concerns over cost, security, and performance issues, according to a recent survey by digital workspace company Citrix. \n\n37signals, a software firm with millions of users, saved over $1 million by moving away from cloud services and investing in its own hardware. \"Seeing the bill on a weekly basis really radicalized me,\" said co-owner David Heinemeier Hansson. \"I could buy some really powerful computers just on one week's worth of [cloud] spending.\"\n\nSimilarly, Plitch, a German firm that develops software for modifying single-player games, repatriated its workloads to its own private data centers, saving an estimated 30% to 40% in costs. \"We needed outright control over our sensitive intellectual property,\" explained managing director Markus Schaal.\n\nWhile the cloud remains a dominant force in IT infrastructure, companies are increasingly seeking alternatives for specific workloads. This shift is fueled by a desire for greater control over data, cost optimization, and improved performance.  \n",
        "## Tata Steel: Strike Could Shut Much of Port Talbot Plant Early\n\nTata Steel has warned that it may be forced to cease operations at much of its Port Talbot plant by 7 July due to a planned strike by the Unite union.  The company initially intended to shut down one blast furnace by the end of June and the second by September. However, Tata claims the strike, scheduled to begin on 8 July, will make it impossible to guarantee safe and stable operations. \n\nUnite has condemned Tata’s statement, calling it another “threat” and emphasizing its commitment to fighting for the steel industry’s future. Onay Kasab, the union’s national lead, told Radio Wales Breakfast that the union has secured “serious investment” from Labour to safeguard jobs. \n\nThe Welsh government has expressed strong opposition to the closure of both blast furnaces, with First Minister Vaughan Gething urging Tata to await the outcome of the upcoming general election. The decision to potentially close the plant early comes as Tata faces a looming job cut of 2,800 workers.  \n\nThe situation underscores the potential impact of the strike on the future of steel production in Port Talbot and the livelihoods of thousands of workers. \n",

The claims, filed on Friday, allege breach of the Consumer Protection Act. \n\nThe first claim, against Asda, involves an 11-year-old girl who developed haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) after eating a chicken salad sandwich. The second claim, against Tesco, involves a man from the South East who was hospitalized with E. coli symptoms after consuming Tesco-branded sandwiches containing salad. \n\nThe UK Health Security Agency reported one death linked to the E. coli outbreak, although the individual had underlying health conditions. The outbreak is believed to be linked to contaminated salad leaves in supermarket sandwiches. \n\n\"Under the Act, companies producing food must ensure it is safe to eat,\" said Harvinder Kaur, director at Fieldfisher. \"If it causes illness, it is a breach of their duty and those injured are eligible to claim compensation.\" \n\nBoth Asda and Tesco have yet to receive the letters of claim and are reviewing the allegations. The outbreak highlights the importance of food safety and the potential consequences of contaminated food. \n",
        "Household incomes have risen by a meager 7% since 2010, according to a new report by the Resolution Foundation. This translates to an annual increase of just £140, or an average of 0.5% per year. This sluggish growth, significantly lower than the 38% increase experienced in the 14 years prior to 2010, is attributed to a combination of slow economic growth and major economic shocks such as the 2008 financial crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and high inflation. \"Income rises have slowed to a crawl,\" stated the Resolution Foundation, highlighting the impact on poverty reduction efforts.

Ms. Page represents Horizon victims including Seema Misra, who Jenkins gave evidence against in 2010. Ms. Misra has stated that Horizon was a \"monster which had blood on its hands, and so do the people who protect [it].”\n\nThe Horizon scandal resulted in hundreds of sub-postmasters being prosecuted based on faulty data from the system, with 700 convicted of offenses like theft and false accounting. These wrongful prosecutions, considered one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British history, had devastating consequences for those affected. Jenkins, while acknowledging he made mistakes, maintains his actions were driven by ignorance rather than maliciousness. He is currently under investigation by the Metropolitan Police for potential perjury and perverting the course of justice. \n\nThis ongoing inquiry aims to uncover the truth behind the Horizon scandal and its devastating impact on the lives of those wrongly accused. \n",
        "## What is GDP, how is it measured and why does it matter?\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) is a key economic indicator that measures the total value of goods and services produced in a country. In the UK, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) publishes monthly GDP figures, but quarterly figures are considered more significant. \n\n\"A rising GDP generally indicates a healthy economy,\" explained Dr. Emily Jones, an economist at the University of Cambridge. \"It suggests increased spending, job creation, tax revenue, and better wage growth.\" Conversely, a declining GDP signifies a shrinking economy, which can negatively impact businesses and workers. \n\n\"Two consecutive quarters of GDP decline constitute a recession,\" warned Dr. Jones. \"This can lead to pay freezes, job losses, and a broader economic slowdown.\" Understanding GDP is crucial for policymakers, businesses, and individuals alike as it provides a snapshot of the country's economic health and informs decisions regarding investment, spending, and employment. \n",
        "## Does Immigration Matter to the Election in Scotland? \n\nImmigration has become a hot topic in the upcoming Scottish election, with parties adopting varying stances on the issue.  While opinion polls suggest concerns about immigration have declined since Brexit, the surge in recent migrant arrivals has fueled anxieties about public services and housing. \n\nScotland's demographic challenges, including an aging population and low birth rate, have led some to argue for a more welcoming approach to immigration, potentially even granting Holyrood control over issuing visas. \n\n\"For more than 20 years, there has been a cross-party consensus on the need to use immigration to address Scotland's demographic challenge,\" commented Douglas Fraser, Business and Economy Editor for Scotland. However, he notes that the issue remains complex, with significant emigration also impacting net migration figures. \n\nThe upcoming election will likely see parties address the issue of immigration, outlining their policies and visions for Scotland's future.  The debate will likely center on the balance between attracting skilled workers and managing the impact of immigration on public services and the economy. \n",

With the maximum amount a debt relief order (DRO) can write off increasing to £50,000, some are turning to this option for a fresh start. The £90 application fee has also been scrapped in England and Wales. However, other debt-management solutions exist. \n\n“First, understand your debts, who you owe, and monthly payments,” advises Citizens Advice.  Create a budget, noting income and essential living expenses. The remaining amount is for debt payments. Explore ways to reduce expenses or boost income. The government-backed MoneyHelper website, and charities like Entitledto and Turn2us, offer benefit calculators.\n\nDon’t hesitate to seek help. Talking about financial difficulties early can prevent spiraling debt. Debt advisors can provide free, personalized support.\n\nPrioritize urgent bills like rent, mortgage, utilities, and taxes. StepChange recommends minimum payments on all debts to avoid default charges.  Then focus on the debt with the highest interest rate.\n\nFor energy bill debt, your supplier must offer a payment plan. If you don't agree, they can switch you to pre-payment mode.\n\nConsider a \"breathing space\" scheme for a 60-day break from interest and charges. It’s available in England and Wales for those receiving debt advice or mental health crisis treatment. \n\nIf you can't repay your debts, explore personal insolvency options. This should be done after seeking expert advice, as it impacts your personal and professional life, and credit rating for up to six years.\n\nDebt relief is a serious step, and it's crucial to seek professional guidance to make informed decisions and find the best solution for your situation. \n",

Gareth Jenkins, who is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police for suspected perjury, told the Horizon Inquiry that the Post Office wanted him to present Horizon as \"perfect\". However, Mr. Jenkins said he was unsure if he actually presented the system as flawless during the investigation. He also admitted to making inappropriate comments about Mrs. Misra, stating that she \"jumped on the bandwagon\" when blaming Horizon for accounting shortfalls.\n\nMrs. Misra, who was wrongly convicted of theft and false accounting and spent time in prison, said this was an example of the Post Office’s culture at the time, where sub-postmasters were blamed for issues, rather than faults in Horizon. The inquiry heard that Mr. Jenkins sought guidance from senior management on what to tell the court, stating that he wanted to \"just tell the truth\" but needed cover from management. The evidence of Mr. Jenkins, who concluded his testimony on Friday, highlights the complex and contested nature of the Horizon scandal, and its impact on the lives of sub-postmasters. \n",

        "The Supreme Court's recent ruling in the case of Grants Pass, Oregon, has sparked debate on how cities can address homelessness. The decision grants cities more leeway to implement stricter measures against unsheltered individuals, leading some experts to express concerns about the potential for increased criminalization of homelessness. \n\nElizabeth Funk, founder of DignityMoves, a non-profit organization dedicated to ending unsheltered homelessness, states that while giving cities more tools to address the issue makes sense, jailing people for sleeping on the streets is \"nonsensical.\" Research from Housing Matters indicates that criminalizing homelessness costs taxpayers $31,065 annually per individual, significantly more than the yearly cost of providing supportive housing, at $10,051.  \n\nCritics argue that criminalizing homelessness not only fails to address the root causes but also increases the likelihood of individuals accumulating criminal records, hindering their chances of finding employment and further exacerbating their situation.  The ruling raises concerns about the potential for further marginalization of homeless populations and the potential for increased costs associated with criminalization. \n",

        "## Is this really the TikTok general election?\n\nThe 2023 UK general election has seen political parties embrace TikTok, but is the platform truly driving the campaign? While Nigel Farage has found success with a five-second Eminem-inspired video garnering over eight million views, the platform's overall influence remains debatable. \n\nLabour's use of TikTok memes has garnered attention, with their 11-second takedown of Rishi Sunak's national service policy generating 5.1 million views. However, some argue this approach feels inauthentic, while others believe it successfully targets a younger audience. \n\nDespite the buzz, TikTok's reach pales in comparison to Facebook and YouTube, where the main parties are focusing their spending.  According to Who Targets Me, £4.2 million has been spent on election ads on Meta platforms in the first month of the campaign. While the \"TikTok battle\" dominates headlines, the real fight is likely being waged on platforms with a larger and older audience. \n",
        "## Social Media Makes Young People Accidental Election Influencers\n\nThe 2023 UK general election has seen a surge in young people becoming \"accidental influencers\" on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram. These individuals, often under the age of 30, are creating and sharing political content that is reaching millions of users, sometimes surpassing the reach of official party posts and advertising.  \n\nTolu, a 15-year-old from London, saw her TikTok video criticizing anti-immigration rhetoric reach tens of thousands of users overnight.  “The post was blowing up really quickly,” she said. \"I was shocked.\"  Similarly, 16-year-old Will from Somerset shared clips supporting Brexit and concerns over knife crime, garnering hundreds of thousands of views.  \"I find it incredibly interesting that most of the time I’m the one who is breaking news to people and not the mainstream media,” he said. \n\nThe BBC’s Marianna Spring, who investigated this trend, found that 90% of political posts seen by young \"Undercover Voters\" – fictional profiles designed to observe algorithmic content – were from individual users, not official parties.  Many accidental influencers have reported receiving threats and abuse, but they also see the platform as a way to engage in the democratic process.\n\nThe rise of these accidental influencers highlights the evolving landscape of social media and its impact on political discourse. Algorithms that promote content based on user engagement can amplify the voices of individuals, sometimes eclipsing official political messaging.  This phenomenon raises concerns about misinformation, manipulation, and the potential for young people to be unwittingly drawn into divisive or harmful narratives. \n",
        "**Bradford: 'Sport putting children off physical activity'**\n\nA University of Bradford academic has argued that a focus on organized sports may be counterproductive in encouraging children to be more physically active. Dr Andrew Daly-Smith believes sport is seen as a barrier by children who don't enjoy participating.  He suggests that instead of pushing sports clubs, schools should focus on general lifestyle changes and integrate movement into everyday activities. \n\n\"While establishing healthy nutrition in schools is a priority to lower levels of obesity, there is also a need for schools to help children move more,\" said Dr Daly-Smith. \"Sadly, the persistence of governments to focus on sport is turning many children and young people off being physically active. It's not about joining a sports club, it's more about ensuring physical movement and good lifestyle choices - like a healthy diet - are built into the school day.\"\n\nDr Daly-Smith's comments come as Bradford Council faces a rising childhood obesity problem. Figures show that one in five children in reception classes are overweight, and one in three primary school leavers. This issue, along with broader health inequalities in the city, highlights the urgent need for effective strategies to promote healthy lifestyles among young people. \n",

While supporters hail it as a champion for transparency, critics view it as a reckless force endangering lives. The US government, for example, has argued that Wikileaks' disclosures on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars put lives at risk. \n\nAmong the most notable leaks was the 2010 publication of a helicopter video showing the killing of Iraqi civilians in Baghdad.

        "The European Union (EU) has accused Apple of violating new regulations aimed at controlling the power of large tech companies. The European Commission, responsible for competition within the EU, stated that Apple's App Store practices hinder rival marketplaces, marking the first violation of the Digital Markets Act (DMA).  Apple could face a fine of up to 10% of its global revenue if it doesn't adhere to these rules. Apple, however, claims its plan is compliant with the law. \n\nThe Commission argues that developers should be able to inform customers about alternative app stores with lower prices, and that Apple's 30% commission on its App Store is excessive.  EU Commissioner Thierry Breton stated, “We have reason to believe that the App Store rules not allowing app developers to communicate freely with their own users is in breach of the DMA.” \n\nApple has defended its actions, highlighting the security benefits of its App Store and pointing to recent changes made to comply with the DMA.

        "**TikTok offered US a 'kill switch' to avoid ban**\n\nTikTok has confirmed that it offered the US government the ability to shut down the platform in an attempt to address data security concerns. The offer, made in 2022, involved a \"kill switch\" that would have allowed the government to suspend the app at its discretion if certain rules were not followed. This revelation comes as TikTok faces a potential ban in the US unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sells the platform. \n\nThe \"kill switch\" was part of a proposed \"National Security Agreement\" which also included provisions like independent data protection units and restrictions on ByteDance's access to US user data. However, according to TikTok, the US government refused to engage in further negotiations after the proposal was made. \n\n\"This law is a radical departure from this country’s tradition of championing an open Internet,\" said TikTok and ByteDance in their legal submission, urging the courts to strike down the legislation. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia will hear arguments on the lawsuits filed by TikTok and ByteDance in September.

        "## Five key takeaways from Green and Reform leaders' Question Time\n\nGreen co-leader Adrian Ramsay and Reform UK's Nigel Farage faced a grilling from a BBC Question Time audience in Birmingham on Wednesday, just six days before the election. The two leaders sparred over a range of issues, including immigration, tax, Brexit, and their parties' candidates.\n\nA notable difference in tone emerged between the two. Mr. Ramsay, often starting his answers with \"good question\", faced audience skepticism while Mr. Farage took a more combative approach, even eliciting laughter with his \"I have no idea!\" response to a question about problematic candidates.\n\nBoth leaders were challenged about controversial comments made by some of their candidates on social media. Mr. Ramsay declined to comment on specific accusations against Green candidates, while Mr. Farage appeared to withdraw support for one candidate live on air.\n\nMr. Ramsay acknowledged his own car was a hybrid, not fully electric, due to infrastructure limitations, advocating for improved public transport and nationalized railways.  He also declined to specify the cost of the Green Party's car scrappage scheme.\n\nBoth leaders expressed strong opinions on foreign policy. Mr. Ramsay expressed concern about a potential Donald Trump victory, while Mr. Farage praised the former President's record. Mr. Ramsay also refused to endorse co-leader Carla Denyer's claims about the UK's nuclear deterrent. \n\nThe debate highlighted the contrasting approaches of the Green and Reform parties, emphasizing the importance of individual candidate conduct and differing policy stances ahead of the election. \n",
        "## Question Time Debate Fact-Checked\n\nThe BBC's \"Question Time Leaders\" special on Friday evening saw Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage face audience questions on issues including rail fares, small boats and Brexit. The BBC Verify team fact-checked some of their claims. \n\nMr. Ramsay claimed the UK has some of the most expensive train tickets in Europe. While comparing fares across countries is complex, a 2016 European Commission report found the UK had the highest inter-city fares for peak single tickets. Since then, UK rail fares have risen 35%, the fourth highest increase in Europe.\n\nMr. Farage stated that migrants arriving in small boats could be returned to France. This is one of Reform UK's key pledges, but legal experts say it's unclear how it could be done under international law. Returning migrants to France would require explicit permission from the French government, which does not currently exist.  \n\nThese fact-checks highlight the importance of scrutinizing political claims to ensure accuracy in the public sphere. \n",

Speaking to the Guardian on Monday, Lord Kinnock expressed concerns about Reform's tactics, stating they \"harvest and plant lies\" and need to be addressed \"now.\"\n\nHis comments follow recent accusations of racism against Reform, with Channel 4 broadcasting undercover footage of a canvasser making offensive remarks. While Mr. Farage has stated that support was withdrawn from candidates who made offensive comments, he maintains the Channel 4 footage was a \"set-up.\"  \n\nLord Kinnock believes that combating Reform's message requires a proactive approach. \"We have to combat this populist nationalism with words and explaining to people what these people are, not just who they are,\" he told the Guardian. \"People like Farage, love the personal attention...so we have to focus on explaining what they are, and all that inconsistencies and falsehoods, they plant and harvest lies.\" \n\nHe concluded by emphasizing the need for Labour to act swiftly and effectively, stating, \"The populist right have to be combated with actions that means the implementation of change which is positive and cumulative and driven by strong purpose in the service of community.\" \n",

Donaghey, now in her early 50s, revealed on BBC Radio Bristol that for almost 20 years, a bottle of wine a night was \"normal\" for her, until it began to impact her relationships and family life. \n\nDonaghey, who has worked in advertising and marketing for many years, said that the industry's culture of \"work hard and play harder\" normalized her drinking habits. She initially started drinking to fit in with colleagues at Rover in Filton, but eventually, alcohol became a \"crutch\" to manage the demands of everyday life. \n\nDespite struggling with alcohol for decades, Donaghey finally found a support group that helped her overcome her addiction. She has been sober for three and a half years and hopes her podcast, \"Big Drink Rethink\", will help others who are struggling with their relationship with alcohol.  \n\n\"We have an alcohol-centric society that is shifting,\" said Donaghey. \"Let's explore why, let's think about our relationships...and have an open conversation about alcohol in the same way we do about mental health or menopause or any other aspects of our health.\" \n",

        "## Private Car Parks to Offer 10-Minute Grace Period\n\nPrivate car parks in the UK will introduce a 10-minute \"grace period\" for overstaying motorists, according to a new code of practice announced by industry trade bodies, the British Parking Association and the International Parking Community. The code, set to be implemented in autumn 2023, aims to create fairer practices across the sector. \n\nThe code will also include a revised appeals system and maintain a £100 cap on charges, reduced to £60 if paid within 14 days. While the trade bodies aim for a full rollout by October, private parking companies will be granted a \"period of transition\" and are only required to fully meet the new standards by December 2026. \n\nHowever, motoring organizations have criticized the code as \"falling far short\" of necessary standards, calling for government legislation to protect drivers from \"sharks running private car parks.\" \n",
        "## Pensions and retirement: 'I don't know how I'm going to work until I'm 67'\n\nAs the general election approaches, voters in Somerset are highlighting their concerns about pensions and retirement age. Doug Workman, a 63-year-old builder from Chilcompton, expressed his frustration with the rising retirement age, stating, \"I don't know how I'm going to cope until I'm 67.\" He believes it's unfair that he started working at 16 and will now have to work until 67, while those who stay in education until 18 will work for two years less. He advocates for lowering the retirement age back to 65.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael Stancliff, an 86-year-old retired newspaper worker from Bridgwater, criticizes the current government for failing to address pension concerns.  He believes pensioners have been \"let down badly\" and calls for tax-free private pensions. \"It's all about pensions for me,\" he said, \"I've been paying tax for 71 years. I'll pay tax until I die.\" \n\nThese concerns highlight the importance of pension and retirement policies in the upcoming election.

While the average household spends £300 a year on gardening, according to the Horticultural Trade Association, budget constraints mean many are seeking ways to garden without breaking the bank. \n\nExperts like \"Cloud Gardener\" Jason Williams, who specializes in small-space gardening, suggest focusing on plants that thrive in your specific location. \"Figure out which direction your balcony faces,\" he advises, \"because that's going to affect your planting.\"  He emphasizes avoiding wasteful spending on plants that won't survive, like sunflowers on windy balconies.\n\nFor tenants sharing spaces, Williams recommends purchasing plug plants instead of seeds, minimizing mess and clutter.  He also suggests using upcycled shelves and chests of drawers for plants, ensuring mobility for potential relocation. \n\nLisa Hudson, an expert grower for the Royal Horticultural Society, recommends starting small, utilizing existing containers and ensuring drainage. She emphasizes free propagation methods like collecting seeds from sunflowers, nasturtiums, or marigolds, and dividing plants like mint. \n\nThe benefits of gardening extend beyond aesthetics. Musician and broadcaster Tinie Tempah, who experienced a transformative shift after having access to a garden, highlights its impact on mental health and creativity: \"To be in a place of nature and be still, you would be surprised at how much that can do.\"  \n\nCreating a green space, even on a budget, can offer a welcome escape from the pressures of life. \n",

        "## Rules 'force disabled woman to choose love or benefits'\n\nRose Kindred, a 26-year-old woman from Ipswich living with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), faces a difficult choice: love or financial security.  The current benefits system, she says, forces her to choose between moving in with her partner or receiving vital disability payments.  \n\nKindred, deemed unfit for work by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), receives £405.40 per month in Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and £809.64 in universal credit every four weeks.  However, if she moved in with her partner, who earns around £30,000 per year, government benefits calculators indicate she would lose her universal credit payments.  \n\n\"I think it's a cruel system that forces disabled people to choose between the security of living and love,\" Kindred stated, highlighting the \"living-as-if-married\" clause that prevents her from living with her partner without losing vital support. She also expressed concern about proposed changes to PIP, which she believes will further complicate the system for those with EDS. \n\n\"I’d like to move in with my partner of five years but unfortunately we can’t because of the living-as-if-married clause,\" Kindred said. \"That's £405 a month to live on entirely, that's before I pay for a private physio, which makes up for what the NHS can’t provide for me. I’m basically stuck living with my parents because that’s the only option available to me.\" \n\nThe case highlights the need for a more nuanced and compassionate approach to the benefits system, ensuring disabled individuals are not forced to choose between love and the financial means to live. \n",

This marks the third time in five years that intense fires have swept through the region, with the latest outbreak impacting Sakha, Russia. The Copernicus statement released on Thursday attributes the fires to high temperatures and dry conditions, ideal for combustion once ignited. \n\nBy June 24th, over 160 wildfires had ravaged nearly 460,000 hectares of land in Sakha, according to the region's deputy minister of ecology, management and forestry, as quoted by Tass. Scientists are concerned about the smoke's impact on the Arctic ice, potentially hindering its ability to reflect solar radiation and leading to further heat absorption. \n\n\"The increasing Siberian wildfires are a clear warning sign that this essential system is approaching dangerous climate tipping points,\" Professor Gail Whiteman of the University of Exeter told the BBC.

We have hundreds of bins for separation.\" He emphasized the role of volunteers in keeping the festival clean.\n\nWorthy FM, a pop-up radio station operating since the 1970s, provides festival-goers with news, traffic updates, and insider gossip. Joanne Schofield, the station's manager for 20 years, describes Worthy FM as \"the escapism from everything around the world,\" highlighting its role in connecting the festival's community.\n\nNo Glastonbury experience is complete without Somerset cider, and the Cider Bus has been a fixture since 1971. Owner Julian Temperley, proud to share his region's culture, sees the bus as a vital part of the festival, drawing in crowds and even hosting celebrity servers. The Cider Bus, along with the countless other individuals behind the scenes, contributes to Glastonbury's enduring magic. \n",
