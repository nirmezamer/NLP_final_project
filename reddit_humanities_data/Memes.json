Airbnb gained traction during this nadir, but, of course, like the predatory venture capitalists they are destroyed everything and now it's the second coming of redlining.\n\nThe pendulum has swung back to basic hospitality needing to remain king but wheewww I can't imagine what hotels are gonna do when they get their monopoly back.

            "It works for me half the time. It expanded my 70 song playlist into a 140 song playlist by helping me find more new music I haven\u2019t heard that\u2019s in the same genre. But that hasn\u2019t always worked as well as it did that time",

How about the problem where it repeats podcast, or switches play order at random, what about all the artists that when selected only plays like one song before playing a bunch of unrelated songs by people who collaborated with the artist once or twice? What about how you can\u2019t just continue a podcast binge when opening the app without it just starting where you left off and switching to some podcast you\u2019ve never heard of when your subs have unplayed content.

I go in my liked songs, find it and play it. Song finishes and plays another song of the same album. I have 3600 liked songs, so the chance of that happening is slim, but whatever.
