Their beef was that, on top of that, it was a literal interactive sex minigame.\n\nThe only game I've ever seen have an interactive sex minigame and *not* get AO is Saints Row 2, which went out of its way to be as non-explicit as possible about it (you see it from the outside of the vehicle like picking up prostitutes in those GTA games, the sex noises are deliberately unrealistic and goofy, and the minigame doesn't directly tie into graphic details of what you're doing). Meanwhile, games have been getting away with tits and sex scenes at M since the mid-90s, so long as there's not straight-up a sex minigame associated with them (lest we forget Phantasmagoria and Fear Effect).",

If they had given it a pass, I guarantee other dev teams would just start lying about the content of their games in order to get a more desirable rating. While I assume Rockstar would have removed them entirely if they had the foresight, I also assume that if they had told the ESRB about it during the rating process, things would have gone much better for them in the long run.

Oh and it happens once per game if you go out of your way to romance someone.\n\nThankfully in ME1 at least, the voice lines for both Shepards are still in the game so modders were able to restore the homosexual options.",

You're operating off of a false assumption. Either to justify your disgusting original comment or because you're legitimately lost and have no clue what you're talking about. The ESRB exists for the purpose of informing parents of whether the content in a game is suitable for them. It isn't Larians responsibility to make sure someone's kids don't see a sex scene in a video game. All of these platforms have a lot of options for parental controls too so it's incredibly easy to prevent kids from accessing content you don't want them to access even if you leave them alone with their gaming system. Furthermore why are you pressed with the introduction of sex but not violence? RDR2 realistically simulates what it would look like if a real person bled out through an artery or had their limbs blown off.

Beyond that, we were on Sony's shitlist (and probably Microsoft as well, but I can only attest to our relationship with Sony given the nature of my position) and everything we submitted to them was put under extra scrutiny, costing additional time and money. The ESRB also had to adjust their policies specifically because of the incident, and in turn also put us under additional scrutiny on everything we did, even for the most innocent games we were working on. It also added fuel to Jack Thompson's crusade against video games.

These statements you're making have small nuggets of truth to them but are so wide of the mark.\n\nThe implication here is that every developer in the world was just blindly coding stuff for months on end with no idea if even the most basic aspects of their code worked, for their entire careers, for decades, until some rando just went \"hey why don't we develop stuff in chunks instead\" and every one of these developers that'd hitherto been doing this moronic method suddenly went \"oh yeah what a great idea\" and pivoted, and that's *hilarious*.",

I don't think we're dealing with a proper adult's opinion LOL but it definitely helps to disperse the ideas nonetheless!\n\nCutscenes are best interpreted as a school play IMO. Everyone has their scripts for what to do but they can fuck up and the Play Still Goes On. The best case-analysis for this in my opinion is any Bethesda game where their simplest behaviors of navigating to a bed or observing someone steal their wares are easily coded-for and comically avoidable.

Their character should update on the server based on their last input and interpolation should try to figure out the \"missing data\". In a bad game, the lag allows them to see into the future because the data they receive allows them to look around a corner and shoot before the server realizes they're not in real time. This would look to the person that died that they got shot possibly even before the other player came around the corner. I'm not sure what it was in this particular game but it's not horribly rare to see lag benefit the lagger.

Review bombing is leaving a negative review not in line with your actual experiences.\n\nAnd who gets to make the call on that?\n\n> Review bombing is when you have a few, very specific complaints about a game that is otherwise good, but you don't feel like an honest review would be impactful enough, so you downplay the good, overemphasize the bad, and act like a decent game is unrealistically bad. \n\nSo because the issues others have with a game are not an issue to you it is review bombing to leave a negative review? If a game has great story but the gameplay is awful then people who focus on gameplay are going to leave negative reviews.\n\n> What I'm saying is a lot of solid 6-7/10 games end up with a ton of 0-1/10 user reviews. That's a review bomb.\n\nOk? If a game is really a 7/10 then naturally it will have more positive then negative reviews.",

The classic Halo games are a better example in my opinion, since the NPCs are more adaptive when it comes to things like behaviour and pathfinding. \n\nThings really just get much harder when you have to involve multiple players and networking concepts (many developers/publishers don't want to shell out extra money for servers that can handle the performance load of having good bots, for example).",

For a lot of people, items having multiple uses is a huge factor in how deep they percieve a roguelike to be.  For example, grease.  Greaseing up a scroll will keep it from getting wet and being destroyed.  Greasing up your armor will make it harder for enemies to grab you.  A wand of ice can make a path across water, as well as damage enemies.  You could throw a potion of poison, or dip your sword in it.  Stuff like that.\n\nIn general, Nethack is more or less now considered the 'baseline' of roguelikes, and people tweak the formula from there.

            "It\u2019s like how shooters were all called Doom Clones for a long time\u00a0",
            "> that original game which was turn based\n\nIt wasn't really \"turn based\", not in the modern sense.  Everything happened essentially all at once.  It's just that you would input an action (move, attack, use an item, etc) and then everything else would take an action concurrently, with certain things resolving before other things based on a set logic.  Nothing would happen between actions, and there was no way to \"respond to\" actions taken by anything else.  It was merely a compromise made based on the constraints of computing power at the time.\n\nThe core focus of Rogue and games like it were that each \"run\" was distinct and randomized/procedurally generated.  It was entirely possible to have an unwinnable scenario, or to have an unreasonably easy layout.  The focus was on the ephemeral nature of a given run, with no permanent progression.  You start, explore, die, start again.  You gradually learn the quirks of certain items and monsters, and better understand the strategy in subsequent runs.\n\nA rogue-lite is a variant where each run is still distinct with subsequent runs starting from the beginning and having unpredictable procedural generation, however you are able to bolster subsequent runs with buffs and boons to make them relatively easier.  This helps make the games accessible to people who don't like the idea of spending several hours only to have nothing to show for it.\n\nAs an aside, this is where the concept of \"save scumming\" came from.  Some games forced you to do a single run in once sitting, but others would allow you to save out to restore a run later.

            "That's not just the age of the game. I always felt like the latter parts of the game were really rushed, because compared to the beginning they were so shallow and unpolished. My impression was that they got crunched for time and couldn't really finish all the acts to the same standard.",
            "I only played it for the first time around 8 years ago and actually really liked it. Much of the gameplay still worked well for me and it has a graphics style that ages alright.",
            "I felt the same way. Did not finish it. Not saying it was not a good game, but it was not for me.",
            "I remember the day/presentation they announced this and just wondering why they would put development in, what sounded like, such a complex and compromising, free-workforce and IP nightmare that would seemingly have no end of legal screw ups to face even after completion of the game. It felt like someone explaining how to cripple development of any IP anything with a gigantic legal minefield.\n\nYears later, I\u2019m just wondering where JGL scurried off to after making such a show of it some 6 years ago.",
            "It was, I remember the excitement I felt when I saw it. The tech demo did have me worried mind you, it felt too ambitious. I hope one day we do get a release.\n\n\nI'm the mean time I can't wait for the anniversary addition, such an\u00a0underappreciated game.\u00a0",

Right, Xdefiant, bunch of mobile games, Skull and bones and Assassins creed Mirage(and Avatar game but thats massive entertainment). None of those games are bad but they arent very impresive either. All of these games hover around 7/10. I can see why people might enjoy them but that doesnt change that for an AAA studio they arent exactly gamechangers or innovators.\n\nCan ubisoft make amazing games? Sure they can,But lets be honest here, large majority of their games are passable fast food at best and disappointments at worst. Even broken clock is right twice a day.\n\nSo untill one of their many studios makes an actual breakout hit again then I can generlize all I want.

Sort of unstoppable force meets immovable object kind of situation. Gaunter O' Dimm and G Man are the best examples here.\n\nVaas has many reasons. A character that challenges your perception; is he truly a troubled multi-layered person, masking something beneath his behaviour, or is just batshit insane? Also, the interesting facts like he wasn't even meant to be an antagonist but just a small boss. Kind of makes you feel respect for the effort behind Vaas.\n\nScarecrow, was just damn good. Disappeared mid-game in the first series, like a small problem to be tossed aside, and then comes back in the third to wreck chaos unparalleled even to Joker himself (talking of Arkham series here), and nearly beat the Batman.\n\nSword Saint Isshin Ashina, made me feel such respect for an enemy I never felt before. Nay, more an opponent. He's truly fascinated with Sekiro, and wants a duel to death even when he's revived to his prime after his death. The lines \"Come, Sekiro!\" at the beginning have been etched in my mind, like he's testing him. He doesn't want Sekiro to lose and die, he wants to see Sekiro defeat him, but still doesn't hold back.",

Guess what they still indulge in even in their 60s?\nThe point is, we tend to pick up our main hobbies and enjoyments as teenagers, and a lot of times it\u2019s a very generational thing the previous doesn\u2019t understand.",

Then I started to notice that all the people around me (in my age range) played video games and had never even considered that at a certain age you are too old for games. It made me realize how dumb I was for considering in the first place. So to answer your question, never. You\u2019re never too old to play video games.",

            "I feel like there is kind of an ebb and flow to the \"acceptability\" of gaming at different ages. Like up to 25ish, your really still a kid. Prime gamer years. Around that 25 year old mark though is when people generally start to finish college, start careers, have kids, support familys. Slowly your free time is shorter and shorter and it's harder and harder to actually invest into gaming. But eventually that pendulum swings back. Kids grow up and move out, careers start to come to an end, free time becomes bountiful again. Young and old don't get scrutinized for gaming like middle aged people because the \"meta\" middle age path is career and family. But obviously not every single person is going to be under the same circumstances in life , so there is no shame in gaming as a middle aged person",

            "I don't find it weird because \"kids are saying it and they don't know shit\". I find it weird because I think they greatly misunderstand what videogames are.\n\nIt is the single greatest art medium ever achieved. Before that, movies were coming close to an all encompassing medium, with voice and color being added over time. But video game... \n\nYou can have games completely about music, like a musically driven puzzle game, or an action game that flows with music and make it a central part of its gameplay. You can also have music as complimentary to the gameplay. Some video game tracks are so grandiose, they surpass many songs made in other contexts. Some game studio have entire orchestra working for them. You can also have the absence of music in a game being an important part of it.\n\nYou can have game that focus on 2D elements, like older games or new ones that cherish this art style. You can have 3D modeling creating masterfull scenery and visual wonders that can only be achieved in dreams. You can use this 3D space to create intricate puzzles and challinging environements.\n\nYou have game with excellent cinematrography, requiring teams of professionnal creating scenes that rivals hollywood blockbusters, or simple choregraphy that gets the point accross in imaginative and creative ways.\n\nYou have voice acting that pushes the characters in the game to new levels of interaction, with some stellar performance, conveying emotion as in the best theatre play or movie or book even.\n\nYou have incredible story telling. Some genre are re-invented. Some ideas are completely novels and not seen anywhere else. Video game stories have moved so many players. A lot i would argue are much better then what we have in some tv shows, movies or books (i mean, there is greatness and failures in every mediums). Some of those stories changed people lives.\n\nAnd ALL OF THIS is interactive. As you listen to music, as you look at a portrait, as you read a book or as you pay attention to a movie, you are passively appreciating it. Video games are interactive. You activaly participate in its many form of art. This, this is incredibly powerfull. This interactive aspect can make it challenging, with reactions times, having to think to solve something or piece together informations, having to press the right command at the right time, creating the right sequence or combo, clicking at the right spot etc.\n\nPlus, for the cherry on top, this is also possible with multiple people simultaneously. Multiplayer is a marvel of technology. The world being connected together and achieving a common goal, like in MMO's or MOBA's or shooters.\n\nGames are not just \"games\". They are the most complete form of art achieved by humanity to this date (imo). They can be the work of a single person (stardew valley) or thousands (AAA titles) and bring together so much in one single place.\n\nIf you think video games have an age maximum, then it would be the same for reading, painting, listening to music, appreciating movies, playing guitars, doing puzzles etc. And... well we all know there is no age limits on those.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the technology involved in all of that... gosh",

To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.\"\n\n-C. S. Lewis",

I\u2019ve also heard it\u2019s a horror game. I\u2019m not into horror games at all. Even ones with jump scares. To give you an example I find Bioshock to be the most I can handle in a horror game. I ended up completing all three BS games but just barely. Is Prey as creepy as BS was? What game is most like Prey?",

            "I would say it\u2019s on a similar level as Bioshock.  It definitely has suspense elements and it can be creepy at times, but I wouldn\u2019t really call it outright horror.  There are the occasional jump-scares though.  It\u2019s not frequent, but it does come up.  It is a really good game, but it might be more suspenseful than you would like though, not sure.",
            "I'd say Prey falls a bit more on the horror side than Bioshock. It's more on the level of System Shock 2.\n\nOn a side note, if you're looking for more Cyberpunk like immersive games, *Deus Ex: Human Revolution* and *Mankind Divided* are great games in that vein.",
            "there's a lot of tension and it can get really creepy but there's no horror, the early game did give me goosebumps tho it's very eerie.\n\n10/10 game tho probably one of the best games i've ever played, play the first 10m and you'll be hooked",
            "Kind of... the atmosphere feels stressful. Not like some pure horror games but I would say yes.",
            "For me, Prey is slightly less creepy than BS 1. I don't think of it as a horror game at all. It's way more of an immersive\u00a0 sim than CP2077.",
            "Prey gets a lot of it's DNA from Bioshock and the ol' System Shock games (think the devs were looking to call it Neuroshock or similar IIRC). I'd say it's pretty comparable to the Bioshock games generally. Maybe just a touch higher on the spook level. There are a few jumpscares for sure, and the enemies are a bit foreboding as you come across them the first time, but I find once you get going with it the game is more dark Sci-Fi at it's roots with elements of horror rather than being a horror game first and foremost.",
            "In a sense, yes. It's not a true horror game where scaring the player is the primary focus but literally any object in the game can be a mimic that attacks you and that leads to some jump scares.\n\nI wouldn't say it's any more \"scary\" than BioShock tho. So if you can handle BioShock you'll probably be fine with Prey.",
            "I found it pretty anxiety inducing and I never finished it. I would consider it a horror game.",
            "People consider Prey 2017 to be horror because the aliens can mimic static objects which pretty much makes the jump scare a factor in the game. That said, you get good at figuring out what is real and what isn't as the game progresses, and the lore behind how everything went to shit is pretty interesting.\n\nI do prefer the original Prey over 2017, but both are fantastic games in their own right. 2017 is usually pretty cheap when on sale, so give it a shot and see if it's worth it to you as well.",
            "I do not like horror games. And jump scares are *incredibly* cheap IMO. \n\nThere is exactly one regular jump scare at the beginning of Prey, and it's totally missable. Plus you can *kinda* predict it. Now, the other *horror* aspect is that there are mimics, so there are a lot of props around the open world that will poof into a black shadow thing when you're near them or smack them. But it's not jump scare-y, but rather you're just cautious when exploring new areas, especially early on. And that means just casually smacking props with your wrench as you look for loot lol\n\nThere is one aspect that falls into the survival horror genre, and that's the fact that you don't get a plethora of ammo. Depending on difficulty, you can definitely run out which would put you at a combat disadvantage against some of the higher end enemies. There are ways to get more, but you'd have to stealth around to get the materials. I personally didn't have an issue with that at all, but I recall some people complaining about it.\n\nFor reference, the only horror game I've ever played was Alan Wake 2 because it links to another game of theirs, Control. Alan Wake 2 is bizarre because I did not like the slow gameplay, and I mostly hated the combat since you're super limited on ammo and other necessary supplies. Plus, a lot of jump scares. But the design and vibes were so amazing that I still pushed through it and really enjoyed the experience. I say all of that to say that Prey is *nothing* like that experience. To me, it felt like an open world, sci-fi RPG-lite (because you choose your perks) that just so happens to have mimics and less ammo than other shooters. If they ever make a sequel, it's a day one purchase for me. Coming from a non-horror fan",
            "It's definitely not a horror game, though it has some horror-ish elements in some themes and encounters. Bioshock is actually a great comparison, both for the style of game, and the general level of horror-ishness.",
            "Not horror but suspenseful",
            "It has a suspenseful and eerie vibe for sure. There are only a few different types of enemies and I wouldnt really call them scary. \n\nIts probably the same level of horror as a Bioshock game, maybe even less",
            "I found it a bit freaky to play for sure, but you reach a tipping point where you realise you can finally fight back - and so from that point on its such an awesome feeling of power. \nWell worth playing.",
            "I liked it and can\u2019t handle horror games either. It\u2019s definitely creepy and there are some jump scare type things where enemies can mimic everyday objects. It\u2019s really the atmosphere of the game that is stressful. You are isolated on a ship where shit is going down. I thought it was really well done top to bottom and fun to play.",
            "I\u2019m a wuss when it comes to horror games as well but I did fine with Prey. If you can handle Bioshock you\u2019ll be fine with Prey. The game gives you a lot of tools to deal with the creepy enemies.",
            "It\u2019s a cosmic horror themed RPG immersion Sim.\nIt\u2019s amazing and one of my top, picks for best games of last generation.\nIt\u2019s not jump scary at least not very often from what I remember.",
            "It's not a horror game. I'd say, Prey is something like Deus Ex with Bioshock settings. The brilliant of Prey is that you can play the game however you like. They give you a number of skill trees to develop your character, and it doesn't matter in whatever skill you invested, you can always solve your mission.",
            "I'd compare it to BIOSHOCK. you'll be fine :)",
            "I'm a huge baby for horror games and Prey 2017 is one of my favorite games of all time. It's got some horror elements but it's definitely not horror. I cannot recommend the game enough.",
            "Its the typical you start off weak and every enemy can one shot you steady transition to you become God among men and enemies piss their pants at end game typical horror to pure action game power build up. \n\nMeeting Prey's ultimate enemy called nightmare at beginning is piss and shit moment. Meeting nighatmare again at the end of the game and you're stun locking and plasma blasting his ass back to the stone age is satisfying.",
            "It has some horror elements and jump scares, but a lot of it is more the build up of tension and intensity versus cheap scares and gore. It\u2019s kind of like Alien: Isolation or Bioshock.",
            "Prey was scarier than Dead Space to me lol. Nothing scared me that much later on.",
            "Yeah its kinda a horror game but it is pretty fun just be ready for annoying blobs to transform and jump out of nowhere",
            "It's an ok game, played about 15 hours, then got bored. The enemies are strong, your guns are bad, and you do everything very slowly and carefully. So maybe it's a bit of a horror game.",
            "If you made it through one of the endings of Phantom Liberty (you know which one) and didn\u2019t find that too scary, you can definitely handle Prey.",
            "I would say it more of an ambient horror game and it plays more like Bioshock or Resident Evil than a tradition horror game like Outlast or Amnesia.",
            "Not a horror but it\u2019s definitely tense. First few hours are pretty tough tbh.",
            "It's not a horror game, but it has many horror elements. It's a game where you'll never feel safe. And the atmosphere is always creepy. Some enemies are terrifying.",
            "I would say no, it's not a horror game.\n\nIt has horror elements, mostly jump scares when it turns out that coffee mug or clipboard or whatever was *actually* an alien in hiding, but...  You get guns pretty early, ammunition is beyond plentiful, and even if you manage to run out, your mighty Wrench absolutely mangles dudes.\n\nDefinitely worth playing though, if only for the intro sequence when you wake up in \"your apartment\".",
            "No. It has its moments though.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty good game, but became an absolute mess at the end. Then again, I played it at launch.",
            "It\u2019s about as much of a horror game as Aliens is a horror movie. There are definitely elements of horror to it, but you won\u2019t often feel powerless against the enemies in the game. The main draw of the game is in how you traverse the environments and figure out how to complete objectives. You\u2019ll typically clear an area of enemies and then you can breathe easy and listen to audio logs, unlock doors, hack computers, etc.",
            "It has some jump scares but the main monsters you\u2019re facing are essentially Nickelodeon slime so it\u2019s never really *scary* scary. I kinda think it\u2019s a weak point of the game actually, you\u2019re just fighting these lame gloopy blobs instead of some Dead Space type body horror.",
            "It was a bit spoky at first, more than Bioshock for me.  After you start powering up a bit then it switches and most of the enemies should be running from you.",
            "Well the main enemies are mimics that can literally be any ordinary object, so if you find the idea of a coffee mug suddenly launching at your face scary it may not be for you. Later in the game when you're a lot more powerful and you're used to them they're more of a nuisance than anything but early on it's definitely scary walking into a room and having no clue if that trash can is going to try to kill you or not.",
            "Personally, I don't find any game where you have a shotgun to be particularly scary, so I guess it depends, but I would say Prey is at \\*most\\* slightly spooky sci-fi. If you're really terrified by some more existential lovecraft stuff, there's a couple parts that might really mess with you, but I wouldn't call it any scarier than Bioshock. Fantastic game though, everyone should play it.",
            "For me there only exists the first version of Prey. 2017 didn\u2019t happen and I didn\u2019t enjoy it at all.",
            "The nightmare is hunting you",
            "yeah kind of",
            "Technically no.\n\nRealistically absolutely.",
            "Damn... I fucking LOVE that game.  One of the most immersive gaming experiences ever for me.  Definitely some good jump scares and some freaky moments, but I didn't feel like the game was designed as a pure horror game.",
            "great game, worth a buy.",
            "It starts out with a horror vibe. As you get more and more powerful, that largely goes away.\n\nI would say it's around the level of BioShock in terms of horror.",
            "Yall acting tough, but when Nightmare appears... \ud83d\ude2c",
            "I definitely found it less creepy than Bioshock. I'd say it's an action game with horror elements.",
            "Kinda yes, but also no.  It's got a lot in common with classic Survival Horror games (limited resources, de-emphasis on combat) but it's not really all that scary.",
            "Everyone in the comments is right that jump scares and a certain level of stress is part of the game experience, but IMHO the game gives you plenty of tools to deal with things as you go. I'm not someone who usually vibes with horror games (I noped out of Alien Isolation as soon as the alien showed up, even though it's a great game) and I played through and loved the whole of Prey.",
            "I played it as a horror game. My buddy played it as a run and gun. It's a sim, you can approach it how you like. For reference his playthrough was about 18 hours and mine closer to 35.",
            "More suspenseful than horror, and once you unlock a few weapons/abilities, you feel more than capable of fighting back against most threats.",
            "If you think being perpetually out of ammo is scary maybe.",
            "It depends. Prey is scary at times in a suspenseful way. There are only two scripted jumpscares, so its not like Resident Evil or most modern horror titles.\n\nIt is very similar to Bioshock and System Shock\n\nIts extremely immersive and fairly slow-paced, I personally loved it and I am also a fan of Cyberpunk",
            "\"Occasional jump scares\" tell that to all those transforming 4 legged fuckers that constantly run around a corner only to ambush me again when I'm looking for them.\n\n\nGame was extremely fun though. Like a bioshock/farcry mixture where you have so many multiple ways to deal with problems and create your own solution using whatever is in your surrounding\u00a0",
            "I actually think HR didn't age particularly well.",
            "Every year I reflect on the games that have been released and conclude that, yep Prey is still undefeated.",
            "Do you have any stupidly overpowered weapons in that game? Strange as it is, if I carry a big gun or flaming sword, I get less scared.",
            "I never played Alien Isolation because it\u2019s a horror game.",
            "Omg!!! That was ending I just completed!! I was annoyed as I was level 60 and ruining everything with my mantis blades and SMG. All of a sudden I have to hide from a robot I could have torn apart especially fighting the chimera!! Having the optical camp and ninjutsu really helped!!",
            "That qualifies as a horror game for me!",

            "It's been a while but no I wouldn't say so. Most guns and abilities are fairly balanced. You do get some \"weapons\" that are actually useful tools. Like a nerfgun that can shoot through narrow spaces to activate switches or distract enemies.",
            "As soon as you find a shotgun and unlock the time-slow power, YOU are the overpowered weapon in the game.\n\nOnly the start is very tense.",

            "Oh yeah i definitely remember that mission, it was absolutely amazing, have you played the final shape yet? The excision mission is one you might appreciate, it has that same level of groups moving with such cohesion you just kinda get blown away, plus some of the character interactions in it are just great",
            "I didn't realize it was even out yet. After what a shit show the last expansion was, I haven't played in like a year. Skipped two or three seasons I had paid for in advance because I just didn't wanna anymore.",
            "Yeah no I get that, lightfall was a shitshow and I took a huge break from the game due to it, still played here and there when the raids or dungeons dropped but that\u2019s it, but god damn final shape is so good, they did everything they could to make a great expansion, the destination is amazing and beautiful, the weapons are actually good even the destination weapons which are historically shit, and prismatic is just a lot of fun, plus the story itself is so good, if you have played destiny for a long time I highly recommend it, the ending to excision brought tears to my eyes, the past 10 years ended with that mission"
