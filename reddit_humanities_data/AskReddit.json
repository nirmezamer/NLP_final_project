            "Ex-casino worker here. I saw way too many people spend ridiculous amounts of money on gambling. I've seen little kids asleep in chairs outside the casino floor cause their parents were busy gambling. A gentleman had a heart attack at a poker table and other gamblers were pissed cause we had to stop the games so EMS could come. \n\nSaddest one though was a lady who wanted to cash a check made out to the electric company. She wanted to know if she could scratch out the company name and write in the casino name. I told her we could not do that.",
            "I didn\u2019t personally witness it but in late 1999 I helped open the Motor City Casino in Detroit. A month later an off duty police officer lost everything and blew his brains out on the floor.",
            "Not a casino employee, but I used to work at a bank. Had a customer asking about something on her account, so I was reviewing her statement and saw these frequent $2,000 withdrawals at the casino nearby. In the one statement I was looking at, there were over $10K in withdrawals, and this customer\u2019s total account balance was somewhere around $60K. I started going backward in her statements and found she had sold a house and received something like $700K less than a year ago, and had steadily gambled it almost all away, month by month. It was one of the most depressing things I saw there, which is saying a lot at a bank.",
            "Coming into work and seeing the same people still playing that were there when I left the night before.",
            "I worked at a casino over a decade ago, but here's mine: Somebody won a small jackpot, something like $2000. When checking her ID for tax paperwork it was discovered that she had put herself on the state's problem gambler self-exclusion list, which meant the casino was obligated to remove her from the building without paying (she wouldn't have been allowed in the building if she had been recognized). While double checking the manager downloaded an updated list (we auto-checked against a local copy that was sometimes a few days out of date) and it showed that she had removed herself from the list with sufficient notice, so the jackpot was paid out.\n\nShe proceeded to put every penny of the jackpot back into the slot machine... And also made a couple visits to the ATM... And at the end of her stay she asked the cashiers if she could be put back on the self-exclusion list.",
            "We had a roulette and black jack table room that joined with a night club I worked in. There was this guy who spent more money than I made in two months in just a few hours.\n\n He wasn't drunk. I tried to get him to stop playing (he was the only player at the table) but he just said he is lonely and playing blackjack was the only thing that made him feel ok. He was far away from home (I think he was Russian) and just really really sad. It was tough to watch. His face looked just as vacant when he left as when he started playing. So sad",
            "I spent a lot of time in the casino, my dad had a gambling problem, it\u2019s sad to watch your hero fall but he pulled himself out and away from that but the things I\u2019ve seen\u2026. \n\nSeen a blind Chinese man come in with his bodyguards to help him gamble \n\nI\u2019ve seen couples blow their entire money and just stand there looking at each other half in tears \n\nI sat next to a woman who lost it all and just couldn\u2019t bring herself to get off the chair because reality wasn\u2019t setting in \n\nMy dad used to really hit it big, and once he would make me play on one machine and he plays on the other\u2026. His was losing and mine started winning big I got shoved off that seat so fast\u2026. \n\nI don\u2019t miss that place it\u2019s full of greed and misery",
            "My first December working in the casino I'm still at I was on a blackjack table and a guy sits down and drops $1565 on the table and tells the dealer \"dealer, my family's about to have a great Christmas or no Christmas\"\n\n20 minutes later it's gone and he asks the dealer if she's happy with herself and how well the casino has to be paying her. \n\nNever saw the guy again(our casino is 95% repeat customers) so I wouldn't be surprised if that actually was his Christmas money.",
            "I watched a lady lose her apartment building business over several years of steadily increasing play. Then she apparently took a shady loan from some people she knew in China and lost all that. She brought her family to the casino for a blowout weekend spending all her players card credits and then jumped off the 18th floor at 3 am. I had to tell her family.\n\nEdit: Ok, here's two more..\n\n15 year old girl appears speed-walking through the casino floor wearing only a short t-shirt. She's drugged out of her skull. When I caught her and got her to stop, all she wanted was her mother. I got her to the med room but the entire time I was with her she only said, \"I want my mom. Where's my mom?\"\n\nKid tweaking for a couple of days had a break and tried to climb behind two large vending machines. He slipped in between them and they crushed him between them. He was 22. I had to watch the video with the police. It took 20 minutes and he did not want to die. It was the saddest thing I have ever seen and we all needed some time after that. Even the cops needed some breaks to continue. I gave the surveillance tech a week off paid because that's something no dude should have to see.",
            "I'm not a casino worker. I was at a bar on the casino floor and an elderly man in a suit and hat sat down a few seats over and started talking to the bartender. \n\nThey made smalltalk and then he mentioned that his wife of 50 years had died of cancer a few weeks beforehand. He said they never had kids and not many friends, so he took all the savings they had and came to Vegas to \"have some fun until the money runs out, then I'll be going home to be with my wife.\" \n\nBartender never followed up on it but just kinda let him drink. I just awkwardly kept scrolling on my phone. What do you even say to that?",
            "Casino worker here - winning big can ruin your life.  It\u2019s like a drug and I have seen so many people try to chase that high again.   They start at higher denomination machines and slowly over time you see them move to $1, .50, .25 and eventually down to the lowest level.",
            "Worked Valet at a casino. One night we got the car and they dropped it off, left the keys in (normal here). I hopped in to move it and it smelled like death. I moved the car and informed my super. He called the cops as it was the smell of a decaying body.\n\nCops came and we opened the truck.... full of groceries.... from 4 months ago.... in the missouri summer heat.  It was chicken. They came to claim their car and were told to not park here in valet again\n\nThey said the person who normally carries their groceries up to their second floor apartment left and they don't have anyone to help them anymore. So now they go to casinos and eat out every night....\n\nThey didn't have money to do this, no idea where it came from. I will never gamble or go to a casino after working valet those years. Many many more stories",
            "Not a casino worker, but still a sad story.  Managed an apartment portfolio decades ago and one of the properties was in Vegas.  Keep in mind that this was before the days of paying your rent online.  We had a zero cash collection policy, but the manager of the property told everyone is was \"lifted\" for the month to help boost our collections.  The perfect storm happened on a Friday that aligned with a lot of paydays.  She collected about $80k (roughly $150k in today's dollars) in cash for rent and then went to the casino and put it all on red.  Her thinking was that she would double it, then deposit the $80k on Monday and nobody would ever know the difference.  She did not win.  Monday comes around and I see that the money didn't get to the bank so I call the property.  Nobody has seen the manager.  Alarm bells immediately ring in my head.  I fly to Vegas.  We eventually found her at some dude's house and called the police.  So stupid.",
            "My dad was a security guard at a casino for 15 years and he\u2019s got stories. When he started working there the chairs at the slot machines were made of cloth they had to change them to vinyl because people would not get up to go to the bathroom and they would piss and shit all over the chairs. People would sneak their kids into the hotel in luggage when kids aren\u2019t allowed in the hotel. Others left them in the car in the parking garage. One guy took a loan out against his house to gamble and lost it all. He dropped dead in the casino. People would literally spend days gambling \u00a0in the same clothes. People would beg for money at the exits of the highway for money pretending to be homeless and use the money to gamble.\u00a0 I could keep going\u00a0 Edit: the casino my father worked at did not allow kids on premises period. If yours does then fucking good for you!",
            "Tuesday mornings. Barely reopened from the 4 hour weekly cleaning and the folks on social security are already in playing penny slots with the $10 left over in their budget.\u00a0",
            "I had a custmer walk up to me as a slot attendant, with four quarters on his open palm. He asked if I had any idea about any machine that might be ready to pay out.\n\n\n\nHe explained he had driven a little over two hours to get to the casino and this was literally all the money he had left, he hadn't bothered to fill the gas on his car and it didn't have enough to get him home.\n\n\n\nBest I could tell him was one particular bank of machines had had several decent payouts, but that was about all I could say, as even slot attendants don't have much idea when any particular machine was going to hit.\n\n\n\nI got called off to another customer, I don't think he even won enough to buy some gas...",
            "Not a wild story as I worked in a standard UK city casino with quite strict limits. \n\nI once saw a person lose their house over the course of a short summer. \n\nNot much exciting just a general sadness and anger from the regulars.",
            "Not a casino worker but I saw a woman stage an impromptu intervention on her father at a blackjack table.\n\nWas playing at a table with all veterans at potawatomi in Milwaukee. We were all doing well except this one guy who was playing table minimum and losing. But we were laughing and taking and having a good time.\n\nThis guy losing is sitting to my right. A woman comes up on his right and grabs him by the shoulder. She says, 'I knew I'd find you here! You said you were going to get groceries! How'd you even get here?'\n\nHe says, 'your uncle brought me...' cue to her Uncle waving to her from a table over. \n\nShe says, 'you have kids at home relying on you. How could you do this again? Come on we're going home...'\n\nHe says, 'olay, fine but I'll just come back later...' as he cashed out like $30 and sulked away. \n\nAs if on cue the 5 remaining guys at the table push their chips in and cash out.\n\nI still think about that family 15 years later.",
            "My ex was from a suburb outside Vegas. \n\nWhen she was like 7 and her dad was AWOL her mom would take them to his favorite casino and send her and her brother out to play \"Go Find Daddy\".",
            "I lived in Vegas for 6 years, all my jobs except for the last were in casinos, I've seen some shit. The tamest is at my first job we didn't work directly for the hotel (just leased space there) so we could cash our paychecks at the cage. One payday, one of my coworkers cashes his check on a break, hits the tables on his way back, comes back 20 minutes later having lost it all. And this wasn't minimum wage either, it was a tattoo shop and he was an artist, so we're talking a check for thousands of dollars. He just laughed, and at least waiting a couple weeks to do it again. \n\nSecond job not gambling related, but I worked at a nightclub in one of the casinos, some girl in line to *get in the club* was already drunk off her ass and popped a squat and pissed and shit right there in line. Like, full on diarrhea all over.\n\nThird job was for a casino downtown. I would start my day walking the property, including the casino floor, and end it that way as well. I'd frequently see the same people on both walks, sometimes days in a row, and each time they looked worse and worse. It was awful.",
            "My mom works at a casino. She was walking through the tables and a guy in front of her pulled a gun from his pocket and shot himself in the head. The gun landed a couple feet from her...feet.\u00a0\n\n\nThis made me think that she's never really mentioned it since. I should probably check to be sure there's no lingering issues.\u00a0",
            "One of the saddest things I've seen was a regular patron who had clearly lost more than just money over time. He'd come in frequently, always chasing his losses, and it was evident that his gambling habit had taken a toll on his personal life. Over the months, he became more withdrawn, and his clothes and demeanor showed signs of neglect. It was heartbreaking to watch someone lose not just financially but also in terms of their well-being and relationships.",
            "Former casino security here \u2026a guy jumping off the 8th story of the parking garage",
            "I was a scuba diver at a vegas hotel and we started at 3am to get the tanks cleaned before people started coming in during the day.   My diver was in the tank and I was spotting.  \n\nI noticed a lot of commotion and EMS going into the club across the \u201chall\u201d in a casino sense.  About 20min they come out with a dude strapped down hard, laughing like the damn joker with his face COVERED in thin razor cuts.  I mean absolutely dozens of them.  Just laughing his absolute head off, actively bleeding and just totally disfigured face.   \n\nIt was so surreal but I will never forget that laugh man.",
            "Casino worker for 35 years. All I'm going to say is, that I believe everyone of these stories. I don't know if they are all true, but I've seen it so many times, nothing really surprises me now. It's truly sad.",
            "Was in AC 20 years ago. it was midnight and there were a bunch of small kids sleeping on coats outside the casino floor\u2026 in the bathroom alone, etc.",
            "The saddest thing I've seen was an elderly man who lost his entire pension in one night. He just sat there, staring at the slot machine, looking completely lost.",
            "Not a casino worker, just somebody who likes casual gambling. \n\nFirst time I was ever at a casino the woman in front of me at the atm took out her last five dollars. And paid a 9.95 atm fee to get it. Her account balance flashed on the screen as she walked away. \n\nAlmost made me wanna go home.",
            "Former cage supervisor - in the span of a month, 2 people committed suicide by jumping off the top of our 6 story parking garage. \n\nSaddest part was that when it happened the second time, all the staff were just like \"Really? Again? That's inconvenient\".",
            "Couple jumpers off the top of the parking garage every few years, guy hanged himself in the bathroom\u2026security and maintenance saw a lot more than I did as a slot tech. I just heard about it, I didn\u2019t walk in on it.",
            "Way too many in 10 years of dealing table games. I\u2019ve seen people lose a lot of money until they cried at my table, people sitting at machines and being there the next day I came to work smelling like actual shit, a regular always brought her disabled kid in a wheelchair and put them next to her while she gambled for almost a day each time. \n\nI had a guy who clearly had dementia at my table and even with complaints they still allowed him to play. He could barely make hand signals and kept forgetting we were in the middle of hands. It didn\u2019t help that he was tipping the beverage server well so he got massively over-served alcohol.\n\nReports on these people should have made it so they couldn\u2019t continue doing this stuff but it never actually changed anything.\n\nThe worst was a few tables away from me a guy\u2019s girlfriend was trying to get him to leave and he got so pissed he tried to choke her to death right at the table. He ran from security into the woods behind the casino and killed himself.",
            "15 years in the casino, on the F&B side. I have seen:  \n-People shit and piss on themselves so they don't have to leave a machine. Shit in the line to the buffet and roll it down their pant leg so they don't lose their spot. Completely not even batting an eye at their actions. I have more shit / piss stories than I care to share.\n\n-People get an opportunity to buy a home, finally, and find out they can't get a lone because 95% of their income has gone into the casino for years.  \n-Someone die, just to have people try to step around the barrier to get to the free soda machine, or over the body even, because they could care less.\n\n-Fentanyl classes had to be given to my team in the event someone found something on the ground. I am glad we did that as a company, but sad it was there and that common.\n\n-Someone throw themselves off the parking structure.  \n-Someone stir up a car chase and end it in the valet, basically suicide by cop. (not really the casino's fault here)\n\n-Don't get me started on Covid handling both pre and post closure. \n\nNeedless to say, I am long and gone out of that world. I NEVER gamble.",
            "Not a worker, but I saw a guy try to bet his prosthetic arm in Vegas.",
            "I have several stories. I worked as a cashier and also a slot attendant for 5 years.\n\nThe worst was when a guy was just sitting at a slot machine with a bewildered look on his face. Like he was in shock. I asked him if he was ok, could I get him a water? He just looked at me and said, \"I need help, man. This just isn't fun anymore.\" \n\nI called my manager on the radio and asked him to grab a casino host, then sat down with him. A casino host couldn't help, but he could take him to a quiet area to talk. My manager came by, I introduced the player and said, \"Guy_name is having a hard time right now. Think we can all go somewhere quiet and talk?\" The manager took it from there, but I felt so bad for him. He was just quietly crying in desperation and whatever realization he had just experienced. \n\n\nAs a cashier, my first Christmas Eve there was the first time I'd ever worked on Christmas Eve in my 28 years. It was also the first Christmas I hadn't been with my family.  Around 8 or 9pm, a lady came to my cashier window and asked for $250 in quarter tokens (several years before paper tickets). I did the thing and she said, \"No, no, no baby! You've got to put some extra luck on these! I need to win, I haven't bought my babies anything for Christmas yet.\" I tapped them twice, wiggled my fingers towards the quarters and squinched my eyes, and said, \"Done! That was all the luck I brought tonight!\" Ol girl was tickled pink, she just knew she was gonna get that jackpot for her babies! \n\nAnother cashier sat with me at dinner break and told me it only gets easier after that. She lied. \n\nLast one for now was the lady who had just won a $5000 or $10,000 jackpot on a dime machine. It was very clear she didn't want it. Turned out she was banned for her gambling addiction and behavior. She was begging to just forget we saw her and give it to anyone else. She just wanted to play. Unfortunately, the law is the law and she was handcuffed by gaming officials and arrested.\n\nWhite: Just thought of another good one. It was an employee this time. She got caught stealing tips players have to the slot attendant. \n\nThe cool thing about casinos is when they catch you, they make note of it, save the video evidence, and do nothing other than add to a report. Once the employee steals enough, I think $500, it's a state felony because technically every non-player penny inside a casino is state property because it's state regulated. Like a bank is federal.\n\nSo they catch a co-worker stealing tips. One day she's just coming on shift and is counting into her jackpot payout bank when gaming stops by and starts talking to her. Gaming guys aren't friendly if they have to leave their office. They're like extra angry chihuahua's that haven't eaten for days and suddenly are being teased with hot dogs, small children's fingers, and pupperonis. Everyone in uniform stops and backs up, then they start loudly reading her her rights. Not only was she arrested, but she got called out in front of everyone she was stealing from.",
            "Oh man, I have a ton from my 15 years as a casino manager, but I\u2019ll just write a few and come back later:\n\nWoman who was an anesthesiologist asssistant hit a \u201cbad beat jackpot\u201d at a 1-2 no limit poker table for around $120k. For non-poker players, this is the lowest stakes no limit hold\u2019em game offered by most poker rooms. The buy-in range was from $100-300 min/max at our room, so by poker standards not terribly high. After she hit the jackpot she started playing the bigger games, first 2-5 no limit ($200-1000 buy-in) and then moving up to 5-10 no limit ($500 min, and I believe at the time it was no max). Next thing you knew she was out playing in the high stakes blackjack pit playing $100 a hand. She got bumped up to a black card quickly from all the blackjack she was playing.\n\nFast forward about 4-6 weeks, maybe 2 months tops and we don\u2019t see her around as much. A few players asked if we\u2019d seen her and a couple let it be known that she borrowed money from them and hasn\u2019t repaid it. She started showing up late at night wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses and playing slots.\n\nShortly after, security determined that she had been living out of her car and sleeping in the parking garage. \n\nThe fall went QUICK. It was just like all the lottery winner horror stories I\u2019d seen on tv but playing out in real time.",
            "Not a worker but\u2026\n\nBack when casino boats used to actually cruise the river, every Friday night we went there was a guy who would grab a $1 poker machine, feed a hundred dollar bill, lay his face down and hit Max bet. Rinse and repeat, 1,2,5 times, once we saw 10 times.  Never saw him win a penny.\n\nCruises were 1 hour 15 minutes, he took about 10-25 minutes max, would get done, leave the machine to take a seat by the gangway exit.",
            "I am going with my GF to Vegas for a week in September. I have no issue with gambling, and have never lost more than 50 bucks before calling it quits. She has never gambled in her life. I think I am gonna take your guys' advice and leave the cards and most of the cash in the room, just in case she has the bug and neither of us know it.",
            "I was at Mohegan Sun during the Kentucky Derby last year or the year before (it was the race where the massive underdog won and had odds like 1000:1) I saw an older gentleman walking the casino floor dressed to the 9\u2019s in the usual derby way (full suit and vest, dress hat, etc) with this look of absolute shock and despair on his face. I\u2019ll never forget it I felt so bad for whatever he was going through.\u00a0",

I came up once and cashed out $400.    Another time $200.   Then the last time I lost the entire $40.    I've been heartbroken ever since and refuse to step foot into a casino again.    \n\nI also sat next to an elderly Chinese man who was playing $1000 a hand blackjack.     He lost $40k while is at and watched.     I will never step foot in another casino.",

At the end of the day when I was getting ready to leave, the same man was at the bar begging for bus fare to get home. The bartender told me he had even given his car to someone exchange for cash. After that day I never set foot in a casino again.",
            "Playing poker at a tribal card room. 20-25yo kid at the table was terrible, and all the other players loved him. As he rebought chips for the 3rd time (that I was present), he mentioned he has just been laid off from the local factory, and he figured he would come to the casino with his severance check. Suddenly, I was far less interested in playing with him.\n\nA few minutes later he busted again, and didn\u2019t rebuy. Pretty quiet when he stood up and left.",

She gambled until everything that she had was gone, and then she sold her house to some shyster and gambled that money. \n\nThe last time I saw her, she was begging on the sidewalk. Never found out what happened to her, but I never forgot her. It broke my heart. I tried to talk her into going home, but she was either into the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s, or dementia, and nothing would get through to her.",
            "Obviously everyone at the casino is trying to win, but the sad truth is people are addicted to losing. The high comes from the anticipation of the win, not the win. That\u2019s why people don\u2019t leave when they win.\n\nI used to do shows at casinos and I once watched a guy blow through $5,000 at a craps table in under 30 minutes. He was making big bets and pushing to keep his bets working even without a point being on. It was sickening to watch him lose so much so quickly. I was up doing simple bets and I paid close attention to his bets to learn what not todo.\n\nA few days later at another casino I watched someone blow through $20,000 in under 30 minutes. He looked like he could afford it, but the look on his face indicated he could not.",

Fron my machine I saw a lady playing slots with tears running down her face. I heard her scream and looked up to realize the machine hit zero and she started bawling uncontrollably. She was screaming that she had nothing left and to please have her money back. Got removed by security. I hit for $150 and cashed out but the walk to my car was terrifying. I'm not a target demographic for mugging, but the desperation on people's faces was noticeable. Never going there again.",

            "I worked a whole host of positions in Casinos over the course of 6-7 years. In that time I saw a lot of really funny, really sad, and really frustrating things.\n\nThe one that hurt me the most was seeing the father of one of my Highschool friends coming in over the course of the years. He started showing up every now and then when I was 19 and had my first job there. He was an older guy (late 50's-early 60's) but still pretty healthy, had a lot of money, drove a nice car had a nice house, even owned a small plane that he flew recreationally. Slowly but surely he was coming in more and more frequently though. He started gaining more weight, he was looking more pale and sickly, drank almost constantly. It turned out that his home situation was going downhill fast. He and my friend (his son) had a massive falling out, and eventually his wife left him and took their other daughter with her. He had nothing left but his money and himself, and even that didn't last. He was never winning anything and had to have lost millions in that time frame. He was in the building for days at a time without moving from his machine. Because of that and the amount of alcohol he was consuming combined with the lack of sleep, aging body, and constant second hand smoke exposure, his health was quickly plummeting. He was always nice and happy to talk to anyone, but even that didn't last as he started snapping at every little thing and not interacting with anyone at all.\n\nI left that job years ago but every now and then my family will go back to that same casino and see him at his same machine looking like a husk of his former self. Even now that shit is heartbreaking to me. Gambling addiction is a dangerous horrible thing, but you never really realize just how bad it is until you see someone you've known your entire life driven to the very brink by it.",
            "Former casino worker of 20 years. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of things, but this one stands out to me. I was the games manager on shift and there was a lady in her 40s playing blackjack. She had been there a few hours and had made quite a few trips to the ATM and her buy ins were getting into the thousands of dollars. \n\nI was doing paperwork in the pit when a dealer called me over while the lady was on another ATM trip and said she was crying just before. I kept an eye on her and after she lost a few more hands I could see the tears start and she was silently crying while playing. I went up and as discreetly as possible, asked her if she was ok and offered help through our partnered addictions help program. She looked me right in the face and got mad at me for asking and told me she\u2019s fine and to leave her alone. \n\nShe was making staff very uncomfortable at that time and it was obvious she was crying more and more as she continued to play and lose. I made the decision to ask her to leave for the night and comped her cab ride home. I tried again to offer her information to organizations to help with her gambling again, but still not interested. \n\nAddictions are heartbreaking to see and I really hope she was able to get help.",

I had to quit because the whole scene went against what I believe. My next door neighbor came in one day and asked me if I could lend them $300.00 cause this machine was \"getting ready to hit\".

The guy in front of me was old either Asian or Latino and he pulled out 15 dollars from the ATM. Like damn, 15?! Go home man. The service fee alone is 4-5 dollars.\n\nAlso at the tables I guess the Indian casino would give vouchers for matchplay up to 20 dollars. So you could play 20 dollar blackjack hand and use the voucher for essentially 40 dollar bet. Old people would come up to me and ask if they could matchplay with my hand (as you still needed cash/chips to do the initial bet which they might not have had) and the dealers would just shake their head since those guys were probably regulars. I wouldn't care, I would just say sure but I probably won't win. If I did win I'd give them the chips or they'd just say bet it again (let it ride).

So I walk in and could see from across the way it\u2019s in a car, windows cracked (it wasn\u2019t a hot day otherwise I would\u2019ve done something asap). I think maybe someone is just running in and coming back. Hopefully, right? I went in, played some craps, come back out later to get in the ride to the airport, and yeah I can still hear that dog out there barking. I told someone who was valet or concierge or something but I wasn\u2019t convinced they would actually do anything.\n\nReality is like some gambling addict is so consumed by their addiction they just leave their dog in the car while they piss money away. That poor dog is stuck in the damn car crying out for its owner or for help.

The sad thing is the first time you spend time in a Casino, which for a lot of people is the first day.  \nThe first thing that strikes you is the smell. It's like a sandwich, the ingredients hit you one after another. First there's cigarette smoke. Even in casinos that have banned smoking, the smell still hangs on. Then there's the smell of stale liquor, cheap liquor. The place smells like a wino. Right under that is the smell of unwashed humanity. Sweat, piss, fart, shart, halitosis, and that unmistakeable old person smell. Then you realize these smells are wafting equally from the casino and the clientele.  \nThen there's the sound, or lack of sound. Despite all these people gathered here for 'entertainment', there is no cheering, no laughter, just the maddening noise of game machines all shouting over each other. The players stare zombielike into the screens, the security look out silently over the players, people mill about among the machines in silence. It feels like a cubicle farm.  \nThen there's the sights. Casinos are dressed up like resorts and theme parks mixed together, but have none of the excitement or people either have. You don't see happy families or college kids on skip years or swedish travelers. You see ragged, worn out people in their pajamas shuffling in to disappear into the machines. Contrasting the bright colors and blinking lights and patterned carpet and very nice uniforms. All this will change your impression of a casino really quick, on your first or second day, before you even see something really terrible.  \n   \nThis place is just selling vice, catering to the beaten down people who indulge in it. It's all just part of the delivery mechanism where they take money and give the products, alcohol and gambling. These people are here to feed, not to play. If they win all they win is a chance to get a little more. You come, you buy your loss, you buy your liquor, you go home, you come back tomorrow. It's so mind crushingly mechanically miserable that when you see the misery manifest it only confirms what you had already worked out.",
            "I was at the casino one night and a guy was on a decent tear. I saw him hit a bunch of jackpots in the $1200 - $3000 range. I would say at one point he was up about $7000. He was tipping the floor people who handed him the money like $100 here, $200 there for each jackpot he won. I went there with $1000 to play with, and at $2 a spin I was there for like 5 or 6 hours. I watched this guy just absolutely tank. He went from machine to machine putting in hundreds and hundreds into each machine. He was not some high roller, just a normal dude. Just as I was finishing up, with about $750 to take home with me, one of the floor workers went up to him and this was the conversation. \n\n\"So I see you're having a run of bad luck right now. I would really hate it if you went home with less money in your pocket than what you gave out to us.\" He said something like \"Oh. Ill get it back don't worry.\" Within 10 minutes he was at the ATM taking out another $1000. Then again at the ATM taking out another $1000. Then again about 10 minutes later taking out another $1000. \n\nDude left about the same time I did, having given out around $1000 - $1500 to floor workers as tips, losing his initial money he came with and at least another $3000 on top of that. I walked to my car a few minutes after him and he was smashing the steering wheel of his truck and screaming.",

I've seen countless people destroy their lives in that manner.\n\nI've watched people die at the table. I've seen people wheeled in \"On a stretcher\" to gamble away their final moments. Old people fist fights. Losses of businesses, children's college funds, primary residences you name it.

I can't say the same for a few people I know.  They play more than they should and always lose.  They blame EVERYONE but themselves.  You can see the look of desperation on their eyes when they are at a severe loss.  A night of fun turns to bitter sadness.  Sometimes I just go to kinda get away and relax.  I already know a few of the bartenders.  I order either just a beer, or a sparkling water, and small talk with the bartenders and leave them a tip bigger than the drink, and go home.

            "Not my story, but stock trader / author / risk expert Nassim Taleb was once asked to examine a casino\u2019s surveillance system. He wrote that it was so sophisticated he felt like he\u2019d stepped into a James Bond film. When they asked his opinion of their \u201crisk management\u201d he reviewed their four biggest losses and near-misses:\n\n- The casino owner\u2019s daughter was kidnapped. To pay the ransom, the owner dipped into the hotel\u2019s cash reserves, which temporarily put the hotel under the legally-mandated cash on hand requirements. She was recovered safely after a few hours, but that move could have cost them their gaming license. \n- A disgruntled construction worker tried to dynamite an expansion to the hotel. He was stopped before anyone was hurt. \n- Another employee, responsible for mailing forms to the IRS notifying them of large payouts, decided on his own to stop mailing the forms. For reasons known only to God he kept the completed forms in a box under his desk *for several years*. The casino negotiated a settlement to pay a large fine, but kept their gaming license. \n- During their headliner show, one of the star performers was bitten by a tiger. He had raised the tiger since birth and it slept in his bedroom at night. The insurers had considered the possibility of the tiger jumping into the audience and biting guests, but they didn\u2019t once consider the tiger attacking a performer. \n\nFrom these examples, Taleb concluded that the casino had invested millions of dollars to monitor games where the odds were precisely known. The true risk lay in events occurring off the tables.",

The place reeked of stale cigarette smoke and there was just this ambience that can only be described as broken dreams permeating the place.  \n\nI saw some lady chain smoking cigarettes and playing two slot machines at once, staring dead eyed ahead of her as she just went through the motions.  Some fellow who looked especially down on his luck wandered up to my group and asked if we had any money to spare.  What took the cake for me was when one of my friends who just happened to be a super outgoing positive guy saw some lady was on a winning streak at a slot machine and he came up and joined her at the machine, excitedly cheering her on until the casino staff approached and told him to \u201ckeep it down, this isn\u2019t Vegas.\u201d  I didn\u2019t gamble that night, I mostly just watched everyone I was with lose all their money, I just don\u2019t really get the appeal of gambling.",

            "Ex casino worker here. I watched a sweet woman get manipulated from being quite wealthy to no money and doing hard drugs because she was lonely and had no family. She even sold her company just so she could gamble with her \"friends\" that she would give money to in order to help her gamble and they would totally share their winnings with her. Her dream was to open up an ice cream store for kids with the money from her restaurant. Eventually I stopped seeing her come in. \n\nAnother one is about an older wealthy guy who would complain all the time when he didn't get a bonus. Casino gave him an Xbox and didn't know how to set it up so I helped him out outside of work.

One day he stops coming to the casino. Hopefully he didn't have another heart attack. \n\nAnother few notable individuals I've met are a diamond store CEO who was actually a lovely individual to be around (surprisingly), a top manager in their auto industry, a famous person I won't go into detail about, and one of the c-suites (I think maybe even the CEO idk) for a smaller tax prep company.\n\nCasinos are mostly filled with people with lots of money (people that love playing slots as if they were candy crush), lonely old people, homeless people, and the occasional curious person or group of people that aren't over 40 just having a fun time on the weekend.

It was a story about a woman who put herself in a list to be barred entry to any casino, but showed up at this casino and won $2000. It turns out she did relent and take herself off that list in time to claim the money so she did get the payout, but due to a lag in updating the list that was not apparent at first. \n\nSo imagine if somehow the casino knew that she'd tried to stop herself from gambling again and imagine she'd been a big customer before that - of course they'd pay out next time she came in!!",

Remove the contaminated materials, remediate the hazards, bring in the construction contractors or general maintenance once the hazards are gone, sign off on repairs, and remove the barriers.

I\u2019m a career corporate middle manager person. \n\nI can speak to the first two elements - balancing your personal and professional life. It\u2019s simple, but hard: ***unless you\u2019re contracted otherwise, do your 8 hours per day and no more***. It is hard to implement this because of the cacophony of \u201cI\u2019ll do that at the weekend\u201d / \u201cI was working late again last night\u201d rubbish you hear from deranged co-workers. \n\nI have nearly 30 years of working in different industries. Two things have been constant:\n- I have never known a boss or HR ghoul brave enough to try and write someone up for \u201csticking to contracted hours\u201d or a version thereof (even though I guarantee an HR ghoul somewhere is ***itching*** to have that one in their eerie, bloodstained scrapbook). \n- Every single boss I\u2019ve had - regardless if they\u2019re good/evil, kind/cruel - would ***never, ever*** stop one of their team working extra hours for free - they will never, ever, ***EVER*** try and stop you, even if they know it\u2019s impacting your health. It\u2019s just sensible business, sadly.  Even the kindest boss in the world will ***always*** accept free labour for the company regardless of the impact on the headcount. (That\u2019s you, BTW - headcount - not your real name, not u/relevant_name4050, but a cost line on a spreadsheet. Always remember that and use it as strength)\n\nThe points above are something I constantly come back to when I need to remind myself of how to protect myself. \n\nRegard exercise, I have a young family, so I get up early and exercise before they\u2019re awake. It\u2019s the only way I\u2019ve found that works. \n\nAll the very best from Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",

            "Tbh, minimizing social media usage, making it a priority to get at least 7.5 hours of sleep at least 5 nights per week, and being mindful of my diet goes an extremely long way. The first frees up a ton of time, the second ensures you have the mental stamina to use that time wisely, and the third ensures you have the physical stamina to do so.\n\nSome things that further help:\n\n- Having a career you value. If you put your heart into what you do, you'll most likely find and end up working with other like minded people with whom you bond. This ends up making both professional life easier to progress in and brings more fulfillment to your \"personal\" life, as you literally see your friends every day.\n\n- If you don't find much value in your career and are single with no kids, make it a priority to change that. If you have a partner and/or kids, talk about how the situation can be improved and prioritize making that happen. \n\n- Getting over the whole \"I do fitness to be sexy\" mentality makes fitness about 50x easier. If you're a man, also getting over the idea that you simply will not ever be much stronger than average makes fitness another 50x more enjoyable.\n\n- Talk to your partner and/or friends (and kids for that matter). Identify physical activities you mutually enjoy and make it a priority to engage in them weekly. Rain or shine. As some examples, it doesn't matter if it's going swing dancing with your spouse, playing soccer with your kid, or taking long walks with your neighbor and both your dogs - it's all exercise and it all adds up!\n\nReally, if there's a recurring theme, it's learning to prioritize. Stop letting life drift by you, start making choices actively instead. And, like I said, the easiest ones to start with are choosing to not overindulge in social media, choosing sleep, and choosing good food.\n\nGood luck!",

            "The best advice is that golf is the most frustrating thing you will ever do. Honestly, your life will be better if you never play. Once you have everything, a round will cost you, on average, at least $60. That\u2019s just the fees for the course and balls, not including drinks. If you play a nice course and drink and stuff, it gets into the hundreds real quick. And it takes so long to learn. It\u2019s intimidating. You\u2019re playing against your own mind most of the time. It takes forever to get good, and when you do, you just realize that you have so much further to go. You hate yourself after every round and question, \u201cWhy do I even do this?\u201d\n\nBut then you stripe a 7-iron 148 yards and it drops 3 inches away from the hole. And it feels like lightning in your veins. You walk up to the green, putter in hand, trash-talking to all your buddies. That\u2019s the magic of golf. You watch the NFL, and no ordinary person can go onto a field and throw a 60-yard pass into triple coverage. You can\u2019t body-check an NHL wingman. You\u2019re not sprinting down the court, dribbling between your legs and hitting Steph Curry threes. But once in a while, on the course, you can hit a Phil Mickelson flop shot that dunks right into the hole. At any given moment, you can, albeit accidentally, replicate anything done by these PGA guys you see on TV. And it makes you love the game. It makes you feel invincible. And that high will keep you coming back for life. At any given moment, you get to feel like one of them.\n\nGolf is not cheap. But it really depends on how much money you are willing to put up front. Honestly, I\u2019ve taught some people golf recently and we just buy a putter first and only putt on practice greens at courses or driving ranges. Then I\u2019d get a used 8-iron, one club, and go to a $15 group lesson. Then practice for three weeks with those two clubs and pay for an hour lesson with a pro using only the two clubs. Then go to the range 5-8 times and only do what you\u2019ve learned in the lessons. Then I\u2019d get two used wedges, like a pitching wedge and a 56\u00b0, preferably with a similar grip to your 8-iron. Take another lesson. Practice more at the range. And now you get a 6-iron and a 3-wood. Same thing. Don\u2019t play a round of golf for your first three months.",

My (28F) fianc\u00e9 (30M) and I are getting married in three months. We've been meticulously planning this wedding for over a year, dreaming of a perfect day filled with love, joy, and elegance. But my sister-in-law, \"Anna\" (25F), is throwing a massive wrench into our plans.\n\nAnna has a tiny dog, \"Buddy,\" that she treats like her actual child. She's one of those people who can't go anywhere without her dog. A couple of weeks ago, she asked if she could bring Buddy to our wedding. Now, our venue has a strict no-pets policy, and frankly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to have a dog at a formal event like this. So, I told her, as politely as I could, that we prefer no pets at the wedding.\n\nYou would think I had just banned her from attending the wedding herself! Anna lost it. She went on a tirade about how Buddy is the most well-behaved dog in the world, how he wouldn't cause any trouble, and how she feels \"naked\" without him. She even pulled the \"he's like family to me\" card. I stood my ground, explaining that it\u2019s our day, our rules, and we want it to be perfect.\n\nSince then, Anna has been waging a passive-aggressive war against me. She\u2019s been posting cryptic messages on social media about how \"some people\" don\u2019t understand the bond between a pet and their owner. She\u2019s hinted that if Buddy isn\u2019t welcome, she might not come at all. This is stressing me out beyond belief. My fianc\u00e9 is trying to mediate, but he's caught in the crossfire. He supports my decision but is also worried about family harmony.\n\nOur parents and friends are divided. Some think I\u2019m being a bridezilla and should make an exception for \"family.\" Others agree that a no-pets policy is reasonable, especially for such a significant event.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole for refusing to let my sister-in-law bring her dog to our wedding?

My (28F) fianc\u00e9 (30M) and I are getting married in three months, and we\u2019ve decided to have a dog-themed wedding. We are huge dog lovers and have always dreamt of a wedding where our furry friends could be part of our big day. Our two golden retrievers will be the \"best dogs,\" and we've invited all our friends and family to bring their dogs too. We\u2019ve planned a beautiful outdoor ceremony with dog-friendly activities and treats.\n\nEnter my sister-in-law, \"Anna\" (25F), who has a cat named \"Whiskers.\" Anna asked if she could bring Whiskers to our wedding. Now, anyone who knows anything about cats and dogs can see where this is going. Our venue is all set up for dogs, and introducing a cat into the mix is a recipe for disaster. I told her, as politely as I could, that we prefer no cats at the wedding for the safety and comfort of everyone involved.\n\nYou would think I had just banned her from attending the wedding herself! Anna lost it. She went on a tirade about how Whiskers is the most well-behaved cat in the world, how he wouldn\u2019t cause any trouble, and how she feels \"naked\" without him. She even pulled the \"he's like family to me\" card. I stood my ground, explaining that it\u2019s our day, our rules, and we want it to be perfect for our dog guests.\n\nSince then, Anna has been waging a passive-aggressive war against me. She\u2019s been posting cryptic messages on social media about how \"some people\" don\u2019t understand the bond between a pet and their owner. She\u2019s hinted that if Whiskers isn\u2019t welcome, she might not come at all. This is stressing me out beyond belief. My fianc\u00e9 is trying to mediate, but he's caught in the crossfire. He supports my decision but is also worried about family harmony.\n\nOur parents and friends are divided. Some think I\u2019m being unreasonable and should make an exception for \"family.\" Others agree that a no-cats policy is more than reasonable, especially for such a significant event.",
            "Definitely! Or when they change it to something really hard to follow like initials like \u201cA\u201d or \u201cI\u201d and I just want to say that they could have named them anything and it wouldn\u2019t matter to the audience!",
            "Real lol there\u2019s a certain stigma attached to being a redditor that doesn\u2019t match my friends\u2019 perception of me and it would just be weird. I have recently gotten my bf into reddit though, but I still don\u2019t see a point in sharing usernames with each other because it\u2019s just not that kind of social media",
            "Doh! And I wanted to write stranger, but I saw your name, so was conflicted, lol.",
            "Somehow this is the one statement that doesn't bug me. It still makes me laugh.",
            "I love how AI put the cat's name in air quotes as if to make it anonymous",
            "Hello. I'm Anna. And I love cats (every kind of cat) and my cats go where I go dammit. If you don't want my cat you don't want me and that just breaks my heart. \ud83d\ude1c"

He had just come back from a long work trip where we had limited communication (he was out of the country and in the middle of nowhere, so no reliable cell or internet service). We\u2019d been up for hours talking and he spontaneously popped the question. I wasn't sure if he had thought it all through because there was no ring and we were both so tired. I didn't want him to regret it later and say, \"Shit, what was I thinking?\" I really did want to say yes, but I wanted to say yes when I knew for sure that he'd fully digested the magnitude of it all and not just decided on a whim that 5am was the perfect time to propose. I explained to him that I loved him very much, and while the spur of the moment thing was incredibly sweet and romantic, we were both too tired to make such an important decision.\n\nHe asked again a couple months later in the middle of the afternoon and I said \u201cyes\u201d that time.

A few more red flags: his dad paid for everything, his extensive porn collection, other unlabeled prescriptions (bubble packs) lying around the house. I tried talking to him about my worries one night, he got upset and had a really intense seizure right in front of me. I called 911 because I had no idea what he was on and have never experienced anyone have a seizure before. \n\nHe called me the next day, said his life flashed before his eyes, and asked me to marry him. He said he could give me everything I ever asked for, \"LOL, you mean your dad will?\" I said I loved him and cared for him, but I felt like there were too many secrets and he didn't take his health seriously. \n\nBroke it off and stopped communicating altogether. 3 years later I found out he was arrested for child porn.",

The 3rd night I had a bad fever and told him he could go out if he wanted because I was going to bed at like 8pm. So he went to the hotel bar I think. I woke up at 4:00ish all sweaty and took a shower and he was still not back from drinking, so I went to the hotel bar (this was a big hotel so it was stil open and pretty crowded) and saw my boyfriend being a little to comfortable with some college-age girl. I asked a waitress of she had seen him do anything, and she told me they had been making out dozens of times. I was too shocked/hurt that moment for the confrontation so promised myself to break up with him as soon as we got home. 2 days later, while we were at another hotel, he asked me to marry him. The answer and the reason were pretty obvious.",

It had a necklace and a paper with cringy love poem made by him declaring his love and asking me for marriage and accept the necklace until he gets a job and money to buy a proper ring. (He had no degrees and no job i had to pay for nearly everything in our relationship. I am also 100% sure his mom bought the necklace too.) \n\nI told to return the necklace.",

            "He proposed by telling me he felt a lump on his dick, when he pulled back the covers to show me he had a ring there. I didn't actually decline it at the time, it was an abusive relationship so I went along with it for awhile but would remove the ring whenever he wasn't there. I knew the moment he asked that I would never marry him. Also he'd cheated on me with his ex and a man by this point, they're the ones I know of. He'd later cheat on me and marry an older woman, this gave me the out I so desperately needed",

            "Wasn't quite a proposal, but more like an attempt to strong-arm a marriage (or at least an engagement). Years ago, I was moving to a new city, and the girl I had been dating for over a year and a half wanted to move in with me (which I was fine with!). The problem? Her family was VERY Christian, and while they could pretend that we had been chaste and pure for the entirety of our relationship, us moving in together was a bridge too far and unable to be swept under the rug. We had an extremely uncomfortable argument all together when she announced her plans to move in, and they said all the horrible purity culture BS you probably would expect: compared her to a cow who gives the milk away for free, a chewed up piece of gum, claimed no man who loved their daughter would even think of moving in before marriage, or at least engagement. We both held firm, and I told them in no uncertain terms that the only way I would propose to someone was after living with them and knowing we would be compatible. They were not happy, but ultimately there was nothing they could do but complain.\n\nAfter three months living together we realized that we very much were NOT compatible. Seeing each other a few days a week and having her sleep over once in a while for the better part of two years was VERY different than living together, and it became obvious that we had very different ideas of what kind of households we wanted. We ended up breaking up, and all I could think was \"thank goodness I stuck to my guns and didn't get married just because it was 'easier' or 'the right thing to do.'\" We would have been miserable.",

            "Not quite a proposal, but prospective alliances yes. Apparently the arranged marriage market where I live heavily favours women nowadays, my parents have been turning down (at my request) about a dozen inquires a month for the last 5 years. And this is only counting people who reached out directly to my folks.\n\nIn my opinion I am way too young now to consider a commitment like that especially to a stranger. And most people in my list of options are conservative, and are looking for a very traditional relationship, which is something I wouldn\u2019t want anyway.",
            "My ex showed up out of nowhere after we'd been broken up for a year. Took me to lunch at a pizza place I wanted to go to. Then pulled out a ring and asked me to marry him. Felt like he had bought the ring for someone else and decided since she didn't want it maybe I would. This was the second proposal, first was from a pregnancy scare, I said no then too. When I told him I was going to get checked for pregnancy he said \"Well I guess we can get married.\" I said I'm not marrying anyone just cause I'm pregnant. I wasn't pregnant just started have irregular periods.",
            "Well,  simple thing\u2026 My childhood friend ended up dying suddenly in her sleep. This was just last year so I was about 25 then. At the time, my Fianc\u00e9e was completely unsupportive and was pissed off. There was no space to talk about my feelings, nor did  he want me to go to the funeral. He did not go to the funeral with me. He just wanted me to leave and move in with him and be his wife. That is fine because that is what everyone wants. However, I just noticed how bad of person he really was. It got so awful that I asked for space to be alone because he was no support. He would have sex with me and I was so out of it that it didn\u2019t even make me feel better because he neglected my emotional being so badly. \n\nDuring this time,  I also graduated and my best friend went to graduation. When my back was turned, he told my friend, \u201c how I was leaving and never coming back here. \u201c\n\nDuring my time of grief, my depression got real bad to point when he would yell at me to have sex with him. It was awful. \n\nHe would keep yelling at me to stop mourning to the point that I just didn\u2019t want him anymore. I was actually disgusted with myself for picking him. So, I drove to my friend gravesite and I said, \u201c I don\u2019t think my friend wants me to marry you.\u201d And gave him back his ring.\n\nEdit: typos. (Sorry, I got a bit triggered writing this again. Despite that, I want to thank everyone for the nice comments. I haven\u2019t really told anyone about this situation except for a few people because I have been so embarrassed and ashamed. I am doing okay. I am currently healing.

Like, ew, no they don\u2019t.\n\nThe worst part is that people actually defended him instead of admitting what he did was creepy, like I was the problem for not marrying someone I didn\u2019t know and who gave off some seriously rape-y vibes.",

Many family members came to visit, everyone asked me why my sister would not move up her wedding. They had not paid a single deposit or anything yet. The answer to that is still unknown, she never changed the date and dad was already gone. I refused to go because I was so mad at her doing that. Anyway, in the midst of all of this, my boyfriend asked me \"do you just want to get married here so that your dad could be a part of it?\" This seems like a very sweet sentiment, but in my heart I knew marrying him would be a mistake. He did not actually treat me very nicely, and ended up really ruining my life financially and in so many other ways later. So I said no.",

I never asked for marriage, but I did make it clear that after I finished university I'd be moving across the country for better job opportunities and wanted to have a clear idea of where our relationship was headed by then. \n\nOne thing about me: I abhor diamonds. It's a moral thing and I also find other gemstones much more beautiful. My ex knew this, as it was something I'd talked about before.\n\nWell, university graduation was approaching; I was about three months out from getting my diploma. Our relationship was still on shaky ground, I had no idea what his plans were for his career or for us. I again brought up that I was leaving the state to advance my career, and we had three months to decide the trajectory of our relationship. \n\n2 weeks later, he gave me a ring. He proposed to me in my dorm room... with a diamond. \n\nIt was at that moment I realized that he was never going to be the right partner for me. I let him down easy, and went on to move out west.",

We had never spent sustained time together. During the 2 weeks I saw a side of him that was moody and hard to live with. \n\nIt was easy for the both of us to be on our best behavior for weekends. Not so much for weeks at a time, when the cracks show lol",
            "My ex and I had been together for 6 years, he had cheated early in the relationship and I found out a few years in. We were just kinda toxic. I was insecure, he was overcompensating. Something never felt right - I never wanted to take it much further. Moving in together was never discussed. He passively mentioned a desire to get married and have a home and it made me panic/anxious, absolutely no joy was felt in my body. I literally felt sick. I told my mom how I felt that night, who told my dad. A few days later he asked my dad if he could marry me, my dad said no, and told me he was going to say no and kinda set me up for success in breaking up with him later that day. So I guess I never technically got engaged but close enough to cause a lot of anxiety",

A few months prior to that, while cleaning up our shared office space, I did end up finding the ring. Instead of being coy about it, I told him that I had found the ring, and told him straight up that if he was planning on proposing at Disney that I would not like that because I wanted the proposal to be something more intimate and special to us, not a clich\u00e9 Disney proposal during Christmas time. He said he wouldn't.\n \nFast forward a few months during our Disney trip, lo and behold, in front of the EPCOT tree at Christmas, he kneels down and pulls out the ring. Of course I say yes in the moment, the photographer is there and people are staring, but after we got back to the hotel, I had to politely sit down and explain that while I do love him and appreciate what he did, I wanted our proposal to be something special between us. \n \nThat being said, he ended up cheating on me and got engaged to a new man less than three months later and then they got married a few months after that with the caption \"Years in the making!\" So in retrospect, I dodged a bullet.",

She laughed at him thinking it was a joke and he got embarrassed, angry, and drove home. They were at her college campus so she was just a short walk from her dorm. \n\nA couple days later his mom called my wife wanting us to reason with our daughter and convince her to marry that wonderful young man. Um . . . no. He never spoke to or tried to contact my daughter after she laughed at him. She also found out he had pulled the same stunt on another girl at the school about a week before asking my daughter to be exclusive so we assume he was on to the next unsuspecting woman pretty quickly.",

He came to visit, uninvited, and proposed (with a ring) as a last-ditch effort to salvage our relationship. I said no and that was the last time I\u2019ve ever seen him. That was in 2004. \n\nWe\u2019ve kept in touch over the years. I truly cared about him back then, but I knew what my future looked like if I married an alcoholic. I loved him.

I know I\u2019ll regret NOT going to see him, yet I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the right thing to do. Definitely torn. \n\nI\u2019ve never regretted saying no to his proposal. I did love him back then, but I know my life would\u2019ve been very hard if I\u2019d married someone with a drinking problem. I know by saying no I essentially messed him up. He never married, and the girls he was in a relationship with after me all but one had the same first name as me. I don\u2019t know if it was a coincidence, but probably not. He\u2019s told me over the years that he still loved me and I\u2019ve gotten the feeling that he\u2019s kind of \u201cheld a torch\u201d for me.

Generous, smart, adventurous, he was a multimillionaire who owned several companies and his day consisted of sleeping, drinking coffee, playing guitar and just being up for anything I came up with. He absolutely adored me and I loved him and his kids too. It was almost the perfect situation, but with heavy heart I realised we weren't sexually compatible and broke it off. We are still good friends now.\n\nTechnically, I received a 3rd proposal from a Kazachstani classmate who needed permanent residency in Europe and was willing to pay me \u20ac2000.

He seemed to accept that.\n\nWe broke up during that last year of college.  He was living with his parents in the NYC suburbs and expected that I'd move to NYC and support him while he tried to get a job in an arts career.  Heck, it's difficult to live as one person in NYC on one salary.  He made zero headway and didn't have any job at all, even after I repeatedly explained I literally couldn't afford this and he needed to get literally any job, save up money, make a more specific plan... I decided... that wasn't for me.  He doesn't actually work in the arts now, he is some kind of handyman, a job he got after his parents kicked him out.\n\nI don't think he was evil, he probably did think he'd get a job in the arts within that year, and didn't initially intend to entrap me in a marriage where I was the only one with a job, but I'm glad we broke up.

No dates, no activities I wanted to do, constant complaining when I had commitments that meant I wasn\u2019t at his beck and call, just no effort whatsoever.

He just didn\u2019t believe me when I pretty bluntly told him I had one foot out the door. He was clearly devastated, but also I felt equally relieved it was over and annoyed he was acting like he had no idea it was coming. \n\nI heard nothing and after six weeks he asked to meet up for \u201cclosure\u201d but really he wanted to tell me he would change everything and still move in together and also he\u2019d been looking at rings so he could get me a ring, if that helped. Not quite asking me to marry him, it felt like he was saying \u201cwill a shut up ring fix this\u201d. Which was insulting, as was the fact he was now promising things would change even though it hadn\u2019t been worth doing any of the previous times I\u2019d asked - because previously only I had been unhappy, but now I\u2019d broken up with him he was *also* unhappy so he was willing to do things differently, I guess. \n\nI told him we were done, I was much happier since we broke up.

I basically had to beg him for the white gold band because he had planned on getting me a sterling silver one despite the fact I had told him that it is a very soft material and would get easily damaged. The reason behind the sterling silver was to get the cheapest option possible. I'm a shop teacher and have a fairly good knowledge of material science as a result, and yet he somehow thought I had no credibility in what I was saying.",

            "As an academic/moral discussion, if there's infidelity, the betrayed should be allowed to keep it.  It's a promisory note of sorts.  If one person holds up their end of the bargain, then that person shouldn't be punished.",
            "Part of the lie was the infertile twin didn't want to reveal that fact to her husband",
            "It's a little dark, but I've always thought it would make sense to talk to a divorce lawyer before getting married. Ask them what *they* would recommend for a prenup. For the same reason I might talk to someone who works at a repair shop before buying something new.",
            "You would need to prove someone was cheating, which could necessitate an actual trial. Most divorce don\u2019t go to trial. Trials are very expensive and people end up settling. One point of a prenup (in addition to asset protection) is to make the divorce process smoother and less time consuming, so spending a bunch of money to determine whether someone was actually cheating as defined in the prenup might not be worth it. \n\nI draft prenups and I\u2019ve never included a cheating clause. In my state, almost all divorces are no fault divorces and judges don\u2019t tend to care about cheating unless the cheating spouse spent significant marital assets on their affair partner.",
            "Possibly the definition of cheating wasn't clarified - talking to someone doesn't=cheating, etc.",
            "For starters, there's all the usual reasons a prenup would get thrown out, like coercion, one party not having valid legal representation, or one party being tricked into signing the prenup. \n\nAnd keep in mind that these situations are very broad and can involve a lot of scenarios beyond someone holding a gun to someone else's head. Something like throwing a prenup at your partner right before the wedding and being all \"You wouldn't want your grandma to have flown all the way here for nothing, right? It's just a basic document saying you won't get my family heirlooms in a divorce. Sign it real quick and we can go on our honeymoon\" could count as coercion and misleading your partner.\n\nAlso, a prenup can be thrown out anytime it seems outrageously unfair. So if the marriage has been together for 40 years, he worked unpaid at her business for decades, and then he's caught kissing a secretary, the court might decide he still deserves some compensation for all the time and effort he put into enriching his wife. Any time a cheating clause might leave someone impoverished even though they demonstrably put a lot of energy into the marriage and family finances, the court may choose to ignore it.",

I drank a metric FUCK ton of sweet tea (at least one large a day) and a burger a few times a week throughout my time there, and while I can't say definitely what caused it, my doctors told me the oxalates from the tea were certainly contributing if not downright causing the stone to form.\n\nI'm aware that black tea with honey is different than sweet tea, but the oxalates are the main concern with both drinks. Adding a ton of sugar to the mix obviously didn't help though lol. \n\nWhat I learned from my surgeon was that tea and coffee contain high levels of oxalates, regardless of the type, and the only thing that really prevents stones from forming is adequate water intake and citric acid, as the acidity of lemon/lime juice helps dissolve the buildup of calcium. I don't know of any benefits associated with honey though.",

If it's something zero sugar then there's absolutely no risks associated with energy drinks as long as you drink enough water daily. \n\nThe only reason energy drinks would be bad is if you're drinking ones with a lot of sodium/sugar. Caffeine dehydrates you, and combined with excess sugar and sodium being the main contributing factors to the formation of kidney stones, I understand where they're coming from but there's nothing inherently wrong with energy drinks.\n\nExcess coffee and tea consumption on the other hand directly contribute to the formation of kidney stones.

            "The way my coworker described it, the doctor behaved like beer was the treatment to turn to when all else fails. Which I can understand; some people are predisposed to alcholism, and chugging beer could be a trigger. But it does make you piss. The lesser evil and all that.",
            "I'm assuming they recommended it because alcohol is a diuretic (makes you pee) and beer has a lot of water content compared to other forms of alcoholic drinks, especially light beer.\n\nThey could probably prescribe some kind of medicinal diuretic, but going out to buy beer would be cheaper."

So I stopped by his place and we ate and chatted and then I pulled out the strudel for dessert. \n\nThis man insisted on making homemade whipped cream to top them off. I was like \"no, no, it's fine, it'll take too long to make, they're good plain.\" Didn't phase him. He had it made in minutes and he was right - that strudel was even better with whipped cream. This is probably also when he learned that making me good food is a quick way to win my heart. Days later it was chocolate chip cookies, then butter chicken, then a cheesecake. \n\nWe moved in together after like 3 months. That was just over 3 years ago. We cook together as often as possible.

I find it weird that people are squeamish talking about bodily fluids and if he was weirded out or tried to hide the fact that he farts or poops would be a deal breaker for me. Obviously, there is a time and a place for all things. But, I am forever fascinated by the human body and am not one bit freaked out by it and all it's bodily functions. I couldn't be with someone that was weird or awkward about their bodily functions. He made me feel comfortable immediately and we married, going on almost 14 yrs. married and 15 years together.

I love this women with my whole heart.",
            "We had met through his brother, who I\u2019d met on a yahoo chat room. We\u2019d im\u2019d at first, then via email and phone for weeks, so we had an easy rapport. We planned to meet in October, once he got settled at college and I had more time, since I was finishing high school and had three jobs. He moved into his dorm the day before and had a million things to do, and it was a big risk for him-we lived 5 hours apart, he\u2019d never even visited my state before, and he was very shy in person. That morning, he went to the campus store to buy a phone card to call me, and just decided he couldn\u2019t wait anymore. He sent me an IM and an email that he was coming, he knew I was off that night, and asked me to meet him at my house. It was so spontaneous and *so* not like him. I loved it!!!\u00a0\n\n\nHe had Mapquest directions and printed directions everywhere- from his dorm to my house, then from my house to the mall, and he wouldn\u2019t let me look at any others. We just instantly got each other- I\u2019d never felt so compatible with someone.\u00a0\n\nWhen we went to dinner, I remembered he\u2019d said he liked to call ahead and order at restaurants so he didn\u2019t have to order in person, because it made him anxious. I asked him what he was thinking of getting, and when the waiter came to get our drink order, I ordered drinks and dinner for both of us at the same time. He looked so surprised, relieved, and then happy! We held hands throughout dinner, and when my dinner came, I moved to his side of the booth so we could be as close as possible.\n\n\nAfter dinner, I figured he\u2019d just take me home since he had a 5-hour drive that night-he had a school meeting at 6am. Instead, he\u2019d printed directions from the restaurant to my favorite park, one I\u2019d talked about on the phone because I love the rose garden. He walked me around the garden, the swan pond, and pushed me on swings. He got this funny look on his face and told me to wait. He ran back to the car and got a rose bouquet out of his trunk that he\u2019d forgotten to give me when he picked me up.\u00a0\n\n\nWe\u2019d just looked at all of these beautiful roses, and this bouquet he looked embarrassed to hand had been in the trunk all day, in the summer. They were so wilted that the stems were rubbery and the petals were mostly gone. I couldn\u2019t stop laughing, then he couldn\u2019t stop laughing. I kissed him, and it felt like we were two puzzle pieces that just snapped into place.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen I was getting out, he had another surprise for me. I\u2019d seen this band opening at Tattoo the Earth a few weeks prior and I was so impressed by them. They had cassette single they gave out at the concert, I\u2019d met a couple of the band members, and I was obsessed-I told him I needed the album when it came out and gushed about how amazing they were.\u00a0\n\n\nThey didn\u2019t have an album yet, so he\u2019d called Hastings in his college town and asked them to order two CDs so they\u2019d have them on release day. The release date was that morning, so he\u2019d stopped by and picked them up before he came in town. It was Mudvayne\u2019s LD50. He handed me the CD\u00a0and we both cried because I was blown away by it-amazing that he would go through the trouble, but also that he wanted the CD too, because he valued my opinion on music.\u00a0\n\n\nWe were happy and miserable, because we knew he had to drive back and we wouldn\u2019t see each other for weeks. I opened the door and he blurted \u201cI love you\u2026. I\u2019m sorry I definitely didn\u2019t plan to say that!!! I\u2019m sorry!!\u201d I told him I loved him, too, and we hugged and kissed and cried. Eventually we got out and cuddled on my couch watching Jerry Springer at night, and he left with just enough time to get home, shower, and get to his meeting.\n\n\nI knew he was the one, and I was right. We got married on the 4-year anniversary of that day, in the Rose Garden we walked through that night. It was the best date I ever had.",
            "I sprained my ankle and he drove me to the ER, and sat with me for 5 hours until I was seen, then he let me stay at his for the night (it was closer to the hospital) helped me shower, made me food. Then took me home the next day. I\u2019ll never forget it \ud83e\udd79 we aren\u2019t together now but just that alone made me raise my standards haha",
            "My now husband invited me to a work Christmas party as his date and this was the second time we went out. We got really drunk off wine and decided to crash the night at his friend\u2019s place close by. The friend only had one extra bed so we slept on the same bed and when I woke up in the morning, I saw that he had put a pillow between us. I realized that if he tried doing something that night, I probably wouldn\u2019t have said no because I was in a really happy drunk state. When I saw the pillow I smiled and felt a lot of respect for him. He then got me breakfast and drove 30 mins to drop me home. We\u2019ve been married 6 years and he\u2019s been the same respectful sweetheart. I feel so lucky.",

Later in the night he told me he had a surprise for me and took me to a building he said he worked at and took me to the very top of it and lead me to the edge where it showed all the city lights and it was so beautiful bro. I felt like I was in a movie. Unfortunately he bombed the second date by forgetting about it and being 20 minutes late and since I guess he was rushing he forgot to brush his teeth too which i immediately noticed and he said since he forgot abt our date he didn\u2019t plan anything so he ended up just taking me to his dorm and introducing me to his roommates and wanted to just talk. I felt uncomfortable since I didn\u2019t know these people and they were staring at me like me and him were gonna fuck or something in his dorm tonight. Especially since he invited me to stay over to watch a movie. So I told him I was leaving and just never contacted him back.",

            "Now that would be something to find out!",
            "Aw, thank you.  Here's the next best thing:  [https://imgur.com/a/pace-launch-as-seen-from-beach-02-08-2024-qjohjX0](https://imgur.com/a/pace-launch-as-seen-from-beach-02-08-2024-qjohjX0)\n\nBack in September I took her on our 'almost 20th' anniversary trip.  She had always said she wanted a huge party for our 20th, so I turned our 19th into a big thing.  But for some reason when we got back home I felt this need to schedule something else, and before the end of the month I'd put together another vacation in February made out of her favorite things.  On that February vacation we went to Miami Beach and stayed at a beautiful hotel, went on a cruise on the first ship we'd ever been on, and finally spent time at her favorite place in the world, Cocoa Beach.\n\nWhile we were there a rocket launch from Cape Canaveral got delayed until just after 1 AM.  I spent some time digging into it and found us a spot on the beach where we could watch the entire thing, unobstructed by anything else.  Those pictures are from, us watching it on a blanket on the sand, inches away from the tide.  She described it as a 'little red seed, going into the sky'.  She loved every second of it.\n\nWe went back to our cabin and watched her favorite vacation trash reality TV, Cheaters.  A few hours later while we were having a snack before taking a nap she told me this was the happiest she had ever been in her entire life.  The only description I can give of how that made me feel is 'My heart smiled', cheesy as that sounds.  She had that effect on me.\n\nWhen we woke up I took her to a local place she loved.  I had a habit of finding random flowers and shoving them in her hair as an excuse to take pictures of her.  She always started off a little shy when I did that, but eventually she'd relax.  I liked to think it was because she realized why I looked for flowers in the first place.\n\nHere's one more:  [https://imgur.com/a/W52EOnl](https://imgur.com/a/W52EOnl)\n\nMy wife loved dolls, and would fix older ones.  This was one of her favorites.  She asked me once if I cared if she brought a doll with us to something or if it would embarrass me, and I promised her it wouldn't ever happen.  So she brought a doll or two to almost anything we went to: the symphony, family events, friends houses, medical appointments, even shopping.   I even bought her special purses that were built to display them while we were out.  On one of the cruises we went on the waiter asked about the doll the second night she brought it to dinner, and not only did she tell him about it but she asked if he wanted to hold her.  He jumped at the chance.  That look is him finding out the eyes changed colors.",

She was sick and so was I and we both just got more ill as the day went on. \n\nI would usually get groceries on the way home, but this day I was so sick. I call my boyfriend to ask if he can get groceries for me since I really could barely stand. He said \u201cthere are enough groceries here *for me* until I leave, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d For reference, every time *he* was sick I\u2019d fall over taking care of him. I couldn\u2019t believe he couldn\u2019t do much as order soup for me. He had 3 months off before his next job started. He literally just played computer games all day. \n\nI said \u201care you serious?\u201d And he said \u201cyeah, I\u2019m busy playing and it\u2019s not my problem you\u2019re sick.\u201d So I said \u201cwow that\u2019s a little hurtful, I\u2019m surprised at how selfish you\u2019re being.\u201d He hung up on me. I got home and he said \u201cI expect you to apologize to me for calling me selfish.\u201d And I said \u201cwell, I think you were being selfish. I stand by that.\u201d He then goes below the belt and references my ex, who literally tried to end my life and was horribly abusive. He said it was no wonder that my ex did what he did. I said \u201cfuck off\u201d and he says \u201cif you say one more word to me right now I\u2019m leaving you.\u201d \n\nHe goes upstairs and I hear him immediately laughing and playing his game with his friends again. I laid on the couch sobbing on the phone to my best friend. I basically had to apologize to him for the whole thing. He apologized for nothing. \n\n3 weeks later, he went to training and cheated on me with a girl he\u2019d met there. They started a relationship and a few days later he dumped me over the phone, while I was still living in our home lol. I didn\u2019t know about the other girl yet, and he spent the better part of a few months making me \u201cearn\u201d the relationship back, until I learned the truth and blocked him. But in his few explanations of why he dumped me, he said it was because I called him selfish, and he couldn\u2019t be with someone who thought so low of him. \n\nOne word.

In my mid-20s I left a job and traveled. When I came back, I took a quick gig to tide me over while I figured out what the next thing was that I wanted to do with my life. That was a conversation group for adults learning English. Ended up doing it for 10 years. I had an absolute blast finding ways to make everybody feel comfortable and welcome participating in conversations about all sorts of topics. \n\nI\u2019ve got confidence for days now and it led me to way better relationships, way better friendships and way better jobs. All I really need to do is make sure I can get myself a job interview because once the interviewer talks with me, I generally get offered the job. Confidence, friendliness and charisma are like 9/10 of the battle in almost any job that doesn\u2019t have some highly technical or certification based component.\n\nWhen I tell people nowadays that I was deathly shy for the first 20 years of my life, they usually refuse to believe me. Now I feel really happy when I have people to interact with, even though I would still consider myself an introvert who values her quiet time in a good book and who needs time alone to recharge.\n\nIf you\u2019re shy and anxious, put yourself in a situation where it\u2019s your role to help other people feel comfortable talking to you. Even just volunteering. It\u2019s easier to be slightly less nervous when you serve a purpose and can be helpful. You may have a local Meet Up group for language learners.

I found some poker tables and sat at the table that just had the dealer and one other dude. This other dude was president of a fraternity that I would join later that semester. I established deep, lifelong friendships through this fraternity. I've been a groomsman and multiple brothers' weddings, some of whom would do the same for my own. And that guy I played poker with? I was the officiant at his wedding. \n\nAnd to think that I was so close to just staying in my dorm room to play some Xbox.

Whether it be a mental note or a physical list you have written, take your goal and then assess every step you have to take to get there. These steps can be as specific or broad as you want. Then, try to only focus on your next move. For example, my main goal is to complete an assignment for school, so I am going to think of what I need to do to get there and then complete each task piece by piece, only focusing on the present\u2026 Goal 1: stand up. Goal 2: walk to computer. Goal 3: sit down at desk chair. Goal 4: open computer, etc,.

So once we had all piled into the car and we're heading to church, of course, we'd complain about the cold despite car blankets and being bundled to high heaven.

ANYWAY. When she was almost 4, she was fascinated with my pokemon go and would help me catch the pokemon. I also got pokemon smile to help her brush her teeth. She also watched a lot of pokemon. And I still play pokemon on the TV on the switch. \n\nFor her 4th birthday, we got a promotional free phone and line on our phone plan just to add learning apps and her own pokemon go and smile and we got her a switch lite and some kid games but she was sad we didn't get her any pokemon for the switch. I explained the switch pokemon games require reading. As soon as she could read, I'd buy her pokemon. She accepted the challenge. So next thing I know I'm buying preschool and kindergarten learning books from the store. She is remembering to take them to daycare every day. She is assigning herself 'homework' every evening. Covid was happening during all of this. So we didn't send her to preschool. Then the next fall I was a bit more comfortable with the idea of preschool and virtual schooling was done. But learned the local preschool fills up like 1.5 years in advance. So they suggested early testing for kindergarten if I thought she was ready and she was over the moon with the idea. So she passed every question with flying colors and started kindergarten at 4 years old. She is very tall for her age, so you wouldn't notice she is a year younger than her classmates by looking. \n\n\n\nTldr: told 4yo she couldn't play pokemon until she could read, she damn near self taught to pass early test into kindergarten to learn to read for pokemon. She now consumes books like crazy too. Not just video games.\n\n\nEdit to add: my son just turned 5 at beginning of June and is NOT starting kindergarten this fall. I have not found the magical motivation button for him. Even though he wants pokemon, he says learning his letters so he can learn to read is \"too hard.\" So this trick must be modified or adjusted and does not fit all kids. Lol",

Parent is up by the register, I'm unloading the cart at the end, kid is in the seat in the cart 3-4 steps away from parent.\n\nOne time one of the little darlings managed to get out of the seat and attempted to climb down.

I see the little guy just as he tips over the edge.  Try to get there to catch him but only able to witness the impact with the floor.  He mostly lands on his legs but tumbles down on to his bum.\n\nI've got nieces & nephews, so at this stage in my life I'm fairly able to assess if a kid is actually hurt or if they just got startled and scared.  This guy opens his mouth wide to really express his discontent that the floor came at him abruptly and way too fast.  \n\nI take a stern tone of voice and point down under him: \"Hey, buddy!  *Did you break that floor?*\"  He looks up at me startled, then looks down at the floor.  Then curious, he gets up and walks in a small circle, checking out the floor.  Since the floor looks normal, I say \"Oh.  Huh.  Floor looks okay.  Sorry, pal.\"\n\nSo now he's happy he's not in trouble, (*and a big person actually said 'sorry' to him!*) so the fall is forgotten.  He wanders over and takes his Mom's hand.

These include, for example: consumption of a product that is inappropriate for the body, fecal stones, a foreign body in the digestive tract (a seed or a hard piece of food). A strict diet or a warming compress can help relieve colic. When intestinal colic occurs in infants, it is recommended to contact a doctor to rule out other causes of the condition.\nColic in babies\nMost often, colic appears between the 3rd and 12th week of life and usually disappears after the 3rd month of life, although in some children the symptoms may persist until the age of 6-9. month of life.

I farmed with my rogue, and raided with my druid.    \n\nAnd yes, everyone would always blame the healer when they died.  I remember we had this one warrior who was so bad at managing his aggro, that every healer just collectively decided he wasn't worth keeping alive.  And he'd bitch us out every night for not getting the heals - he could in theory outdamage a rogue or a mage, but it meant nothing because he was made of paper and had nothing to control his aggro.",

On the \"he\" side we would charge and men would get in and fuck the butts inside.\n\nWell sometimes they didn't have enough people on the \"she\" side so I was asked to get myself in the \"she\" side to fulfill demand. So me and two other girls would go in tearfully and comply. Sometimes we would have something other than penises shoved in violently, without lube. Sometimes it was screwdrivers, glass bottles, pens. The only foreign object I got in was, I assume, a knife, and once it stabbed my anus I screamed and moved forward. I was bleeding, but it didn't cut me too bad.\n\nI was back into the corridor two nights later.\n\nIt was deemed illegal and closed maybe one year later.",

            "Years ago I was staying at a kind of hostel/short term rental place in Costa Rica. Another American from Cali gave me some high dosage edibles. I think they were cheeba chews 1000mg. I knew my tolerance and knew that I only needed very small bits of these bars to catch the buzz I was seeking. One night I shared some appropriate small doses with friends I\u2019d made there, and went out for dinner and partying. All was well with us, but I\u2019d left a mostly in tact 1000mg bar in the common area at the hostel. This common area was like a courtyard with an un-gated entryway to the street. Because of this set-up, there was a security guy there all night, every night to make sure no drunks or nefarious people wandered in. It was always the same guy, Leo, every night for the many weeks that I\u2019d been there. When we got back to the hostel late night, it was quite bizarre to not see Leo anywhere in sight. Some other things he took care of (late night lighting, locked up surf boards) were a bit off too. Our group wonders about this a bit, but we don\u2019t think to much about it and carry on hanging in the courtyard. Eventually (like 3 am) we decide we want to play cards, but no one has cards. I knew there was some at the front desk recently, so go to retrieve them. Lo and behold, there is Leo sound asleep in the most uncomfortable looking position tucked under the desk. Right beside him is a small trash can with the Cheeba Chews wrapper right on top. Dude unknowingly ate nearly 1000mg and probably had a real bad time before abandoning his job and cowering in this position. I felt absolutely horrible. We checked his breathing and pulse, and all seemed fine. Carried him to a couch as he couldn\u2019t be woken. I sobered up and manned his post until morning. When he did finally wake, it was pretty clear he was far from having his wits about him, so I explained to him what happened and let him go sleep more in my room. He didn\u2019t emerge until his shift the next night, still not his usual professional self. Sorry Leo.",

            "Perfect example!\n\n*\"Religion of bigotry and violence!\"*\n\nLet me tell you something as a former Muslim turned Christian. First of all, this PERFECT example displays how the times are prejudice against Christians, because on this site I cannot utter a word about your side of the political fence but you can gun my side of the fence down with lies, disrespect, and insults without having to worry about retaliation from Reddit. Now think about the power dynamic there. Doesn't that feel a little prejudice? It's exactly as I said. Here I am talking kind to you after you spat on my culture and beliefs in this era where spitting on other people's cultures and beliefs is considered \"hate speech.\" Yet it is not \"hate speech\" when targeted at Christians.\n\nSecond of all, right wing is politics. You can be left or right or like myself NIETHER and still be a Christian.  The left is just as extreme as the right. Think about it. \"Bend to my will or be cancelled and arrested.\" How does that sound? It's extreme. \n\nThird, violence? Really? What are you going to do, bring up the crusades? Well, as a former Muslim, I'd like to inform you that the crusades are merely a direct response to Jihad. Jihad was first, Crusades fought back. The Crusades are only demonized because for some reason people think Christianity is a white religion and only white people were Christians. Not knowing that one of the earliest mentioned locations in the Torah is near Etheopia, which was right next to the garden of Eden where Adam and Eve was, made in the image of GOD. Adam and Eve likely looked like Etheopians and Mesopotamians. \n\nChrist was a Jewish man who essentially grew up in Africa and Asia, migrating to Rome, where the people were olive. White people adopted Christianity. It's not a white religion. It's not even considered a religion to some people.\n\nTruth be told, the US is not run by striaght white Christian males. It's run by bisexual Freemasons.",

If it's something that you're not into or don't get enjoyment from, but otherwise have no real objection to the fetish, then you should probably do it once in a while for their pleasure and enjoyment. I don't understand people who don't get excited by pleasing their partners.",

You'll go out in the Christmas rush to spend $500 on earrings that look indistinguishable from the earrings they already have because your partner likes it?\n\nBut staying at home fulfilling your partner's sexual fantasies by rubbing $0.50 worth of balloons on them as they're naked and squirming in sexual ecstasy is where you draw the line?!",

Even if it's on the other person's Yes list, if it's a No then it's always a No. The only person who can decide to make it a Maybe or Yes is the owner of that list.\n\nMaybe are things that neither of us need or desire, but can/willing to do if the other person is into it.

When she passed away, some of those memories still stick with me - not because of the other people, but because of the joy I know we had together and isn't that what it's about?",

Unless its on my complete No never list, I would way prefer doing something that I think is a 5/10 but they think is a 10/10, over doing something that we both think is a 8/10.

She was understanding from the start, and with a little time, it became fun! The key for me was finding ways to tie quick release knots and getting cuffs that use Velcro or something easy to take off quickly. The funny part is that I\u2019m not the one being bound, I was always just afraid that I would hurt her or something and wanted to know that I could \u201cset her free\u201d if I became anxious about it. So now, after ten years, I\u2019m totally comfortable with it, I even enjoy it a bit myself. People deserve to explore with someone they trust, and sometimes that means a give and take.",

            "I\u2019ll try anything once.",
            "How would I know that I don't like it, without trying it at least once? Of course there are some limits, but what's the point in not trying new stuff?",
            "At least I\u2019d be willing to give it a try, unless it\u2019s extremely dangerous, involves poop/puke or is illegal/just unethical [for example, involving animals, for some reason that\u2019s not unequivocally illegal in my country].",

            "Of course, to a degree. People do things they don't particularly want to do but will make their loved ones happy all the time. I see no reason that shouldn't extend to the bedroom.",
            "Mostly, yes, but anything to do with poop or pee is an absolute no go for me",
            "Really depends on the fetish no? If it's something I'm not into but they like sure. If it's something I dislike or makes me uncomfortable then no. I think you'd have to be a selfish partner to refuse to ever do something you're ok with solely because your partner is the only one getting off on it.",

(I'm into feet)\n\nStarted getting serious, dating exclusively, and one night mid coitus I ask permission to lick her toes etc\n\nShe was surprised for a second, but definitely didn't say no, and after seeing how much I liked it, she definitely accommodated me. \n\nThen a couple months in, we're going at it and I just stick my face in one of her pits and take a giant whiff.\n\nI'm nearly at event horizon, but she then decided the armpit thing was too weird. A real pity, too. She was a cool chick and i was smitten.\n\nTurns out a foot fetish is the vanilla ice cream of taboo sexual acts. \n\nWanting to smell and kiss and lick a hot chick's pits? Take me to jail, like she immediately lumped me into the same category as the trenchcoat flasher guy or something.",

            "generally yes, unless it includes shit or piss.",
            "I have some limits, but frankly, the more strange or unusual the fetish, the more intimate it feels to be the only person in the world who will give that to them.\n\nAny guy can go down on her, but who's going to put on the darth maul mask and paint her nails while she rides me? I get to be the ONLY guy on Earth who knows that side of her. That's job security, boys.",
            "My main \"kink\" is my partner's enjoyment, so as a general rule, yes.\n\nIf I'm disgusted or it breaks my morals somehow (by doing real world harm to someone or something) then no, but if their kink is just \"weird\" or not my kink, then yes, I'm incorporating it into our sex life.\n\nI don't even think I agree with people saying \"occasionally\" or \"as a gift\". I think your sex life with your partner should contain things that excite you both, proportional to how they make you feel. If I'm absolutely neutral about something that drives them crazy, I'm going to like doing it to drive them crazy and so I'll want to do it often.",
            "Generally I don't mind shitting on my husband but only if  he cleans up after.",

            "yes unless it is something gross or illegal , definition of these two depends on place and person.",
            "Sure, unless it was something like rape play or wanting to be slapped or blood, plus some other extreme stuff.",
            "No, because trying a fetish involves a lot of comfort and consent. If I'm not comfortable and don't consent to being a part of the fetish, I wouldn't want to do it.",
            "Hell yeah. If I have a fetish, it\u2019s turning her on and making her feel good. Barring truly disgusting stuff that she would never ask for anyway, I can\u2019t think of anything I wouldn\u2019t do if she asked.",
            "As long as it doesn't make me overly uncomfortable I see no harm.",

If I dislike it, it\u2019s one of those am I up to trying it for their happiness? Maybe, if I just get nothing from it and it doesn\u2019t cause me issues, physically or morally, okay, if I\u2019m up to it.",
            "Depends (yes, I did mean it that way).",

            "Maybe. Depends what it is, certain things are off limits.",
            "Yes. We so everything for each other.",
            "As long as it\u2019s not something offense to me I absolutely would.  I don\u2019t have to get anything out of sex personally for me to enjoy it.  As long as my partner is living her best life I\u2019m 100% down.",
            "Only if I don't mind it. If I do not like it, then no.",
            "It depends on what it is, but I'd probably go for it",

            "I've done a lot of this. A lot. I frequent fetish hook up sites and a trade for a trade is a common thing. You do things I want that no one else will do, I do the same for you. I've gotten to fulfill WILD sexual fantasies this way, and I've fulfilled absolutely bonkers fetishes for others. So yeah I'll do it. As long as it doesn't involve feces, children, or the unwilling, I'm game.",
            "Depends entirely on what it is and if I'm comfortable with it.\n\nLike if a woman wants me to worship her feet, or pee on her (or vice versa) or something, I won't get anything out of it, but I'll do it...\n\n...but if she wants to engage in coprophilia, that's a **hard** \"no\" from me.",
            "Depends on the fetish. Some I\u2019d be perfectly fine indulging, but others would be a hard no.",
            "Depends. If it's costumes or roleplay or something, sure\n\nIf it's \"beating the shit out of me\" or \"pissing everywhere\", I'd rather not\n\nAlso, I'm probably gonna be secretly judgmental as hell about it",
            "No, bc I'm not into it. If they want to do something I'm not cool with they can do it with someone else.",
            "Yeah, totally. It\u2019s important to have your own personal boundaries, but if their fetish and your boundary don\u2019t overlap, why not give it a shot?",
            "Sure, I love trying new things and have never said no to a partner\u2019s fetish before",
            "It depends on what the fetish is. Whether I would or wouldn't is not definitive.",

            "If I'm neutral on it? Sure. Seeing your partner get off is hot and that would make me enjoy the experience even if I don't care for the fetish. \nIf I actually dislike the fetish or feel weird about it, I won't though.",
            "Depends on what.",
            "Turning my partner on turns me on, whatever does it, I'm into it \u2013\u00a0with the exception of a short list of things. If my partner was super into one of those things, they'd just have to deal. Sex is a partnership, not a transaction.",
            "Probably not. I'm selfish and set in my ways.",
            "Depends on the context. But if we both want it, sure",
            "Yes, because I\u2019m keen on trying everything and I want to give them pleasure",
            "Absolutely.",
            "I think that I would be able to try it and see how it goes. I think that would be something you\u2019d put on the table when discussing it. Try it twice and then talk about it. Communication would be key.",
            "Sure why not I don\u2019t care",
            "It really depends on the kink and the person. I\u2019ve done a lot of things I\u2019m not into but they are, but have also had to draw lines sometimes. \n\nOne woman was really into biting. I said ok but don\u2019t go hard I\u2019m not that into it. She wouldn\u2019t at first but there were times where she went feral and drew blood. Had to stop. \n\nAnother was a woman who was into knife play. I gave it a shot until it turned into cutting. I\u2019m not about cutting a woman for any reason (unless life or death situation kind of deal) and the risk factors for me were way too high. \n\nSo yes but with boundaries.",
            "Depends on the fetish, but probably.",
            "There are definitely limits, but i would and have. Just seeing my partner get really into it usually does it for me, so I tend to find that even if I'm not into it independently, i do very much enjoy participating for them. \n\nThere have been multiple instances with an ex where he asked me to try something (like CBT on him) where i initially said no and that i was uncomfortable with it. After giving it a couple days thought and dipping my toe in, so to speak, I was perfectly fine with giving it my all afterwards. Seeing my partner utterly giving in to what we're doing, whether it be as sub or a dom, is all I need.\n\nI guess you could say I \"borrow\" kinks",

            "sure, unless it's a hard no. I've had people into feet, I am not, but it doesn't bother me if that's their thing. I'm into pegging which ain't really an easy thing to find men into (or at least I haven't had much success) so if they weren't into it I'm not gonna force it",

            "Yes - my goal is to keep her pleased and happy, so even if I don't enjoy it, as long as it's not something horrible, I'd do it. \n\nIt would also lead to her reciprocating at some point too, so we both win.",

            "If there was something that she asked me to do that maintained the sanctity of our relationship and didn't cross any boundaries, I'd be open to explore it and do it, even if it did  nothing for me. She has done the same for me so it's only fair.",
            "I mean it depends. There are some fetishes that I'd say a flat out, no buts about it no to, but there are ones that I just dont care about.  \nFor example, my partner is into light pet play. Calling me 'puppy' in bed is kind of his thing right now.  \nAnd I'm not crazy about it, but I much prefer it to being called good boy-good girl (I am nonbinary and I can't seem to figure out a term of endearment I want him to use for me in the bedroom bc nothing feels quite right but I know once I figure it out it's really gonna scratch that praise itch that I've got).  \nAnd like it's not a big deal. It still feels good. He's still doing stuff for me.  \nLike I love being bitten. It's not his priority in bed, so I ask for it. He bites the crap outta me a couple times, I let him call me puppy, it works out. We both enjoy ourselves with a little bit of give and take. Not a big deal.",

            "Personally, it's not as fun when the other person isn't into it. Knowing it excites them too is part of the fun. \n\nMy partner does some things for me that they're okay with but not super excited by and it's nice and intimate but not as fun as finding an outside contractor who is into the same thing. LOL",
            "No.\nIt's very important to me that we both enjoy sex and I don't enjoy fetish",
            "Yeah.  If she likes it, I\u2019m glad that I have a go-to!",

If I'm less than neutral, it's not off the table but some discussion and boundaries need to be established, but I'd have to hate it to say no completely.

I'll do it for him on special occasions or if I'm getting a favor in return",
            "Depends on what it is. If it's something like Scat or Yellow Showers that's a hard fuckin no. Something like wax or bondage may not be my thing, but I have no inherent issues so long as it's done safely. Not my thing, but it ain't all about me.",

            "Sure, why not? I'm married, I'm her only sexual outlet for the rest of her life.\n\nShort of stuff that is a hard limit. But if it's merely not my thing, of course.",
            "If it isn't something that makes me uncomfortable or something I find to be wrong or gross, why not? Even if I don't care much for it, I want to please her if possible.",
            "No, and I don't expect them to do any of mine if they don't like it. Plain and simple, find a compromise or other things we like.",
            "Like most comments, it depends. There's a difference between dressing up as a cop for her, and letting her shit in your mouth.\n\nI'm pretty adventurous when it comes to sex. If my wife said she wanted to have a threesome, I might be down. If she said, \"this is Steve, he's going to be my boyfriend\" that would be a hard pass.\n\nHell there are things that I'm into, but put to an extreme I'd say hard no. Wanna pull off onto a dead end in the middle of nowhere and fool around in the car? Awesome, that's exhibitionism with little chance of being caught or facing punishment. Fuck you on the same floor of a club, that's too much exhibitionism with too high a chance of getting caught and facing punishment.",

            "Never again. Traumatized me only because I gave in after months of being asked for",

            "Sure. Because I'm not selfish.",
            "As long as it wasn't one of my hard nos, then absolutely without question.",
            "Yes, though that might not be saying much because I'm a freak who will try almost anything once (as long as it doesn't involve blood)",

He is also willing to do that with me (luckily a lot of our interests line up). If it's something that isn't intolerable or a terrible experience, I'd be willing to explore/practice his needs from time to time.",
            "Possibly. There's a pretty big difference between \"Not into it\" and \"revolted by this\". So long as it's on _this_ side of this line I'd accommodate with an equally accommodating lover.

            "If I don\u2019t like it then I won\u2019t do it. (sorry not sorry foot lovers) If I don\u2019t mind it and it\u2019s not gross then I might try.",
            "Eh, my view on life is do everything once if it will not kill you, or lead to irreparable damage to the body. So I would be fine it. If they like it then we go do it. It is fine.",
            "Depends on what it is. If it\u2019s actively a negative experience for me, then no, but if it\u2019s just something I\u2019m indifferent to then sure",
            "Depends. This is situational. If it involves drugs, alcohol, and potential felony charges, no. Other than that, I might be game.",
            "My partner would need to be *special*\u00a0",

            "If its not harmful or intrinsically disgusting to me, I'd try it if he asked. I'm not going to indulge a scat fetish or risk injury from trying to diaper his grown ass, but if he wanted to experiment with something benign but odd, probably.",
            "If she ends up really into something that I'm not, of course, I'd do for it her. I do have a few hard no's that I won't get past, but overall, I'm open to trying new things and making sure we both have the best experience possible.",
            "Yes, but that's a soft kink of mine, there are of course limits to this. Same thing in a romantic relationship, sometimes we do things to make our partners happy, it's a give and take.",
            "Ide try it at least once. anything after that we will see",
            "Yes I have. I do it for him 100%",
            "As along as it doesn't involve violence or that cnc stuff, I'm pretty much game.",
            "Depends on how far outside my boundaries it is. If it's like right on the edge I'll play along but if it's way out of left field, they'll have to figure out how to compromise to keep us both happy",
            "If it\u2019s something that I just don\u2019t gain any pleasure from, yet they do, then I\u2019ll do it as much as they want me too. However if it\u2019s something that I\u2019m not okay and/or not comfortable with then I\u2019ll quite simply just have to explain that I\u2019m not going to partake.",
            "No, because of my religious values",
            "Look as long as I\u2019m not left with any bodily harm or risk of getting sick over something, whatever floats her boat I will be down for it",
            "Sure yeah. I have my lines in the sand, but as long as it's not one of my hard limits I'm open to the idea.",
            "Only if it doesnt go beyond my limits",
            "Depends",
            "If it's something that doesn't bother me or make me feel bad, yes I would do it. The idea is that both parties feel sexually satisfied, and if I can give them pleasure by fulfilling a fetish... it is valid. As long as, I say again, it is not something that bothers you.",
            "I absolutely would.",
            "Short answer is yes. Long answer is it depends. There are limits.",
            "It depends, if it's too immoral and unhealthy I would say no...",
            "Depends. One girl wanted to suck my nipples. That was weird and felt uncomfortable but I can accept that as a new experience. Maybe MAYBE even licking my asshole. But pegging? That's a hard no.",
            "It depends on the fetish... my mind is open. and I like to try new things. If I find it very uncomfortable or disgusting, NO. It's a matter of experimenting.",
            "I would not turn down any sexual request from my wife.",
            "It really depends on the fetish and what exactly my role in that fetish is.",
            "If it\u2019s something I\u2019m not strongly against but it gets my partner off I could be into it. I really get off on the pleasure of my partner.",
            "I will try anything that my partner wants to try once, as long as they are sincere with their request.\n\nDoing it for a second time will depend entirely on the first time.",
            "Men are more excepting of certain perversions. I would also like someone that I love to be happy. See a bigger picture",
            "It includes involving a third party and I'm not interested in involving others into our relationship. He can continue fantasising about it.",
            "Would depend on whether it crossed a line for me.",
            "I mean, I told my wife I\u2019m up for basically anything other than scat, so yeah, I\u2019ll give any fetish a shot at least once.",
            "If I found it disgusting then no, I wouldn't want to associate him with something that was negative to me. \nHowever, if it was something I just wasn't into but got him off it would be hot to get him so turned on.",
            "That would depend on the fetish, and whether you actually mean 'fetish' or 'kink'.",
            "Thus depends on a lot of variables.",
            "I would as long as it's not too painful or scat. I'm a pleaser, so if she enjoys it and gets off, I'll definitely be into it.",
            "Maybe.. that really depends on what it is. And how willing she is to actually talk about it.",
            "I told my wife the answer to everything is yes.",
            "Oh you mean scat play? No absolutely not.",
            "There's been a couple kinks I've dipped my toes into this way and while they aren't my favourites, I'm willing to try them more than once.",
            "It depends what it was. If it made me uncomfortable or it brought up past trauma in some way then no. I would be willing to compromise in some way.",
            "Try it- if it\u2019s not pleasant- then don\u2019t do anything to please the other. It\u2019s supposed to be a joint thing or nothing- as in it should bother them that you\u2019re not really into it. Find a happy medium. Communication is key .",
            "Unless it involved piss or shit, maybe?",
            "Depends on the kink! I have before. Feet and pee are not really my fetishes at all but I\u2019m happy to oblige because I think it\u2019s nice to be appreciated and I don\u2019t have an ick about them. Other things, like scat or severe pain or bleeding are all hard nos for me. Cheating would be a hard no and a deal breaker",
            "For most things yeah since my kink is making someone have epic orgasms. Seriously depends on what the fetish is.",
            "My ex wife's fetish was celibacy. Did not concede.",
            "I'm always happy to satisfy my partner, already know her limits. So yea I don't see an issue with whatever she comes up with.",
            "Depends on the fetish. Scat? Nah. Impact play? Sure",
            "After 20 years together I can't imagine a scenario I say \"no\" to, other than other partners. We are completely open in terms of communication, and we're on the same page about other partners.",
            "As long as I don't find it particularly objectionable (i.e. too painful/degrading/disgusting/whatever) then sure, why not? I've never had a foot fetish, but just the other day a girl told me she wants to jerk me off with her feet because it's a fetish of hers. Doesn't hurt me any to give it a try, so why not?",
            "It's unlikely for your partner to have a fetish that only they like, surely there is at least one other person out there that is in to the same thing",
            "Am I allowed to put saran wrap over me before the poo torpedo is launched? If so then possibly may be indulgeable",
            "It would really be down to specifics. Not really into blood sacrifices to the fertility goddess.",
            "Massively depends on what the fetish is. Tickling? Sure. Shit? Absolutely not",
            "Yes (unless its incredibly fucked up), Because I want to please my partner. Not doing it because you aren't into it is really selfish.",
            "Only that involves just the two of us other then that I\u2019m game.",
            "Yeah ill try anything once and if its good for her then i can deal with damn near anythinf",
            "The most I would concede to is probably a \"golden shower\" and even then it would be a one time thing and we never speak about it EVER to ANYONE EVER.",
            "It really depends on what it involves, if it's something not too crazy I'll at least try it, but if it's some poop smearing electric shock chair chemical neuterization I'm gonna have to pass",
            "It depends on what it is, if she is like I want you to wear a clown mask idk be like hmm I\u2019ll try it but if she is like I wanna shit on ur chest then in out",
            "Just to add, to help the conversation with your partner there are numerous online questionnaires you both can fill in that identifies kinks you are both in to, or at least willing to explore.",
            "Anything involving poop - no. Everything else, I'd probably give it a shot.",
            "For the most part yes, but my ex gf was into blood. That's too far lmfao",
            "Down for almost anything to please a partner unless there\u2019s a risk of it being unsafe or unsanitary",

            "Of course. If you\u2019re not willing to be game with your partners special criteria, you\u2019re not really a partner",
            "If she was open about it, I\u2019d be open. Her biggest issue is that she often simply doesn\u2019t communicate, so god only knows what she wants. It would actually be a big step for her.",

            "Fem dom",

            "Yes. But to a point. I will try most things atleast once and if I am even somewhat comfortable with it we can do it every once in a while. There is no other reason then I also want to take care of their needs.",
            "I\u2019ll try ANYTHING once",
            "Depends on the fetish and if he will let me do something that I only like.\n\nNow if I say no and he keeps on, I would question the relationship. Kinky stuff needs to be taken seriously because it can kill you.",

She was like \u201cat least this won\u2019t take as long!\u201d",
            "My thoughts exactly. If a girl was really intent on sucking my toes for some reason I\u2019d let her, but if she wanted to shit on my face that would never happen",
            "Exactly! Like, my fetish is seeing my partner get off. There are very few things that I wouldn\u2019t do if I was asked. I don\u2019t have to be into the kink, but if she is, then sure as shit I am.",

It's always wise to question their consent for a sec and make sure you're not pressuring them. It's also wise to consider safety & likelihood of regrets. Beyond that, go for it.\n\nAnything between you and your partner(s) in bed is perfectly fine if everyone is happy before, during, & after.

They had to do something to address it and they also tried to push the plot that they had already written forward at the same time. \n\nI understand why they did that.

People went in with expectations that it'd be targeted totally for girls, but it wasn't.",
            "I think you've got it backwards. It wasn't until after they took power back does Margo's Barbie recognize the plights of the kens, after which she promptly leaves and I'm sorry but did we watch the same movie? Because \"new, improved, and more equal Barbieland\" didn't happen. The kens asked for one spot on the supreme Court and the dismissal of that \"maybe one day kens will have the same rights as women\" as a joke was admittedly good, but when you look at the lack of reconciliation of those two plots, the joke ends up being a validation of the sexist men throughout history who say \"just keep plugging away and eventually you may get equality\" as we literally a minute before had a *celebration* as the allegorical sexist men took power back.  But the movie never reconciled that and had the Barbies acknowledge what they did wrong (which I think would've been good to highlight the feminist men who have/continue to stand against the patriarchy as part of the fight for equality even when it benefits them). \n\n.\n\nAgain, don't get me wrong. I actually liked the movie and I know this couldn't be what they planned. I don't think the movie is man hating like many claim. That's why I said there probably were a few scenes cut, scenes that probably explicitly calling out the Barbies for engaging in a matriarchal society. Something like Alan saying \"I'm helping you because they're in the wrong, not because you've been in the right, when we fix this I hope you all will try to make this place better\". I get what they were going for, and I think it really just failed to cinch the ending. It wanted the kens to be the patriarchy (which it did well I think), but also wanted the kens to be an allegory for women's experiences under patriarchy (which I think it also did well) but it refused to actually follow through and have the Barbies realize that they're reinstating their own form of the patriarchy, that they were the allegorical patriarchy.",
