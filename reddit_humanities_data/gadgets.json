            "I\u2019ve had my budget printer for years and have it pretty dialed in. The only problems I run into are warping when the ambient air temp fluctuates. Because of this I would LOVE the heated enclosure. The extra speed would also be nice but enclosure is what sets this apart from other klipper printers.",
            "I love every feature, nearly every main one is something my current printer doesn't have",
            "auto leveling >>>",
            "Im looking for a better 3d printer, I would certainly love to give this a go.",

            "I'd love to post videos from the time-lapse camera",
            "The camera is great. People love to see the time lapse of their part being made.",
            "The camera is an awesome feature",
            "I really like its reliability, printing straight out the box, auto calibration and being able to view the print remotely. That is what is important to me.",
            "The 60\u2103 active chamber heating, and the camera have piqued my interest",
            "Active heating seems like the obvious standout feature.",
            "I like the sound of the print head being able to heat up as high as it does. I\u2019d like to give higher temp filaments a try with it.",
            "The heated chamber is definitely attractive.",
            "Would love to win something like this",
            "I\u2019d love a camera that actually works - my other printer, has never had the camera work well in the handy app or via desktop. That alone would be killer, but also having a true high temp hot end makes it a wonderful addition to any lineup",

            "The camera is definitely a top notch feature. Would love to win this. Goodluck!",
            "Integrated timelapse prints! Great for showing the client things are being done.",
            "I have not been able to use a 3D printer since college. Man it would be great to dive back in and explore the technology change from the last 5 years",
            "Looks like it has all the goodies a new 3D engineer could want. \n\n-Remote camera to view your prints away from home. Maybe my favorite part that separates from the competition.\n\n-Heated enclosure to keep temps accurate and mitigate sound as well as fumes from some plastics.\n\n-Full auto calibration is an incredible boon if you've ever had to do it the manual way.\n\n-Nozzle temp gets hot enough to do advanced plastics or nylon filament\n\nReally looks like a great machine.",
            "I like the Print right out of the box feature.  I dread setting things up and often times they don't work right away or I'm not motivated to open it immediately because I hate the work that will be involved.  So print right out of the box is exactly what I'm looking for.",
            "I\u2019ve had a few enclosed machines, and they do a decent job of printing higher temp materials, but a chamber heater would be absolutely game changing for printing truly tough and durable prints with excellent layer adhesion.",
            "Whoa, active chamber heating? Could be a gamechanger",
            "Chamber heating is definitely the key feature here. When printing abs, I have to wait 30 minutes for my bed and chamber to heat soak enough to start printing.",
            "My favourite feature would be the actively heated chamber. There arent many consumer level printers with an actively heated chamber, which allows for easy printing of high temp materials",
            "60\u2103 chamber heating with 350\u2103 nozzle and 120\u2103 bed would be great for nylon and PC.",
            "During my studies i always envied others who had access to 3d printers as they could easily create awesome projects. With this i could go back to some of my project ideas and make them properly. As I'm not so familiar with 3d printers the feature that is the best for me is printing right out of the box.",
            "Sign me up! I like that you can print right out of the box",
            "I like 3d printing and 3d printing accessories",

            "Built in timelapse printing sounds nice!",
            "I like it when people give away stuff",
            "Chamber heating is a new one to me. That's cool.",
            "Favorite feature: Chamber heating",
            "The heated chamber. Would be useful for some engineering materials and it's the one thing my bambu lacks.",
            "I like that the Q1 Pro has fully auto calibration.",
            "I\u2019ll be the guy to make the dumb comment. I\u2019ve never had a 3d printer so my favorite feature is the printing and precision thereof.",
            "That heated chamber would be the best thing when I'm doing ABS printing. I've been struggling with home made heating chamber for awhile.",
            "Honestly having auto-calibration capabilities sounds like a godsend. I've printed a few things at my local maker-space and it breaks my heart wasting extra filament because the calibration is off.\u00a0",
            "I\u2019d like to compare this my Bambu P1S. I\u2019ve been 3d printing as a hobby for a decade now and the state of the tech in the last two years has been **astounding**.",
            "This would make my son's life and mine, exponentially more fun. Forget about all the extra pros like learning, no screen time, bonding, motor skill fine tuning, problem solving, tech savviness, skill learning- the fun wed have would be priceless. toys, replacement parts, and household items, racecars, gifts, our own funko pop knockoffs. Wed be pretty stoked. And youd get to witness it all.",
            "I've been wanting a 3d printer for awhile to help with printing board game pieces for my local community. We have a lot of aspiring game creators, but not enough 3d printers.",
            "Active chamber heating sounds like a wonderful solution to many issues with other printers",
            "Full auto calibration sounds awesome! I would love to try it out.",
            "The active heating chamber would be a welcome upgrade!",
            "Time lapse with built in camera is awesome",
            "Active heat chamber.",
            "1080P camera with time-lapse support sounds like a great way to monitor prints and share footage afterwards with friends and family.",
            "I'd love to try my hand at 3D printing with a nice setup like this.",
            "I like active chamber heating",
            "The active chamber is my favorite thing about the Q1 Pro. I would love to have a 3D printer :)",
            "The fact that i could introduce my children to this tech would be great. It'll be a great introduction to engineering, which all three are very interested in.",
            "Easily the chamber heating.",
            "Active chamber heating",
            "I never win give aways but what the hell! I've been wanting a 3d printer!",
            "Autocalibration is such an awesome feature, from FDM to DLP anywithout autocalibrate becames a slog to work. I also love it has a camera built in so I dont have to get more hardware to make it work like I want!",
            "It prints stuff!",
            "Great to make small parts with.",
            "Active chamber heating sounds good\n\nThanks for raffling!",
            "Whoever doesn't say full auto calibration is nuts, heated chambers are all great, but having full calibration end to end is such a big win, coming from an old ender 3 pro, that was fully manual i spend more time getting it ready than actually priting lol, i'd LOVE to win one of these, as i can't afford a good printer any time soon lol",
            "What an excellent offer. Thanks for the opportunity.",
            "I love that it\u2019s so simple that you can start printing out of the box",
            "Full-auto Calibration",
            "I love that it's a 3d printer that I could potentially win for free.\n\nI learned how to use a 3d printer when I was in highschool and had a blast with it (even though the teacher was a creep)\n\nI'd be ecstatic to get back into modeling\n\nThis 3d printer is so good it's like LSD, Weed, and a crisp sunset rolled into one lil' box.",
            "Auto bed leveler looks nice!",
            "print right out of the box is very cool and something i'm eyeing pretty hard (in a good way!)",
            "That active heated chamber is a game changer",
            "The thing I love about those printers is the plug and play functionality. Every time I want to print something from any cheaper alternative, you have to waste all this time to calibrate etc. Even then there is still a high chance for something to go wrong.",
            "I love the simple setup and easy calibration!",
            "I don't have any 3D printer so all the features would be new to me, I did own one before and couldn't calibrate it for shiii so the fully calibrated thing sounds sweet to me",
            "Heated chamber is my favorite feature.",
            "Commenting!",
            "Heated chamber and camera are really nice features",
            "Never owned a 3D printer before, but would like to print simple parts. This looks handy!",
            "Favorite feature of the Q1 Pro is the reasonable price.",
            "Hmm, one feature, I would say, after building multiple printers that having it print out of the box with little setup but \ud83d\udcf7 makes it possible to remote print.",
            "Woo! Autolevel!",
            "A missed opportunity to call this the Qidi Pro Quo1!",
            "Full auto calibration.\u00a0 Followed by the camera. Getting tired of the beagle camera.",
            "This would be a great entry into 3D printing!",
            "The heated chamber and auto leveling seem like very useful features, only have used other 3D printers in a Fablab/Garage lab, having one myself would be \ud83d\ude0e",
            "A good printer goes a long way when ink costs more than gold or oil by weight",
            "Full auto calibration sounds like a huge time saver.",
            "I\u2019m super excited about the chance to win this 3D printer! The heated printing chamber is such a cool feature\u2014it keeps the temperature just right and helps prevent warping. Plus, being able to use so many different filaments means I can get really creative with my projects. This printer would totally take my 3D printing to the next level!",
            "\n\n>  What\u2019s your favorite feature of the Q1 Pro!\n\n\u200bIt 3d prints.",
            "My favorite feature of the Q1 Pro is the heated chamber. My current printer doesn't have one and can't have one without serious modifications (heat would damage the hardware).",
            "To add a second printer to my collection would be amazing! I\u2019ve also heard good things about this bad boy!",
            "Easy to use would mean the rest of the family could print as well",
            "Honestly as a newbie, I'm hoping Auto-Calibration is all it's cracked up to be. Sounds like a life saver.",
            "I've been trying to get into 3d printing for a while, but it has a pretty high barrier to entry.",
            "Having a built in time-lapse feature...AND auto calibration? That's a dream come true to amateurs like meee \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\n\nI really do hope to win one.",
            "Built in camera is really cool!",
            "Here\u2019s hoping.\n\nCould use some kit to help with rapid prototyping.",
            "My step daughter would absolutely love this. What she does with just a 3D pen is amazing. I can only imagine what she will be able to do with a printer",
            "Built in HD time lapse is always a welcome feature.",
            "New to 3D printing, just moved into a new place and finding loads of DIY things that a 3D printer would be useful for! Like others new to 3D printing, auto calibration is probably most important to me as a newbie!",
            "There are quite a few good features, but I would have to say full-auto calibration would be at the top of the list",
            "The chamber heating is real cool, but the time-lapse camera is my favorite feature!",
            "Thank you! Camera is cool.",

            "Build size 245x245x240mm\n\nnice",
            "Just one favorite feature? I have to got with the auto calibration, but the camera to keep an eye on the print is quite the nice comfort feature as well.  \nI don't want to sound like \"the old guy\" but manual calibration and the loss of a print due to bad bed adhesion was a pia in the beginning of 3d printing.  \nAnd thus people searched for little tricks like scotch tape and glue sticks to keep the print on the bed.",
            "Everyone is saying chamber heating, but \"full-auto calibration\" sounds pretty great to an old idiot like me who's a little trepidatious about getting this to work properly.",
            "man i stuck at constructing things, and having a printer would only enable me to make even more broken things, but it would be fun",
            "Auto calibration!",
            "For someone like me who has only printed in pla the heated chamber would be a real game changer allowing me to print abs and more exotic materials.",
            "I appreciate the simplicity of setup as well as the nifty time-lapse video feature.",
            "Full auto-calibration wins it by far as my favorite.  Less work on the front end means more time for you and less headache.",
            "The auto calibration is awesome. I like being able to move the printer without having to manually fiddle with the calibration afterwards.\u00a0",
            "350C and an actively warmed environment are perfect conditions for soldering - wonder if somebody will try doing some automated solder deposition with this",
            "Auto bed levelling is a must.\n\nSaves so much hassle and time.",
            "I would love a nice 3d printer.  there are so many small parts i would print to fix things around the house.",

            "This would work great so my fianc\u00e9e and I can create wedding favors for our guests in August.",
            "Full-auto calibration makes printing a carefree process",
            "The heated chamber and full metal heat break by far, having both of those opens so many doors and possibilities and would be a huge upgrade over my creality and anycubic printers",
            "The Timelapse support! I always love watching those videos and gifs because they\u2019re so satisfying.",
            "I love the feature of having a camera already part of the printer. I love seeing time lapses of prints occurring but don\u2019t want to fuss over adding a third party system just for it.",
            "Definitely the auto-calibration. Never used a 3D printer before, so anything that makes starting easier.",
            "I vote Active chamber heating.",
            "I have been wanting to get into 3D printing for some time and have never had the funds to get one. But based on the research I have done, I love that the QIDI TECH Q1 Pro talks about their chamber heating so that the 3d printed object does not warp and it does not require assembling the printer for hours on end, but instead is up and running in 10 minutes. I look forward to making fun toys for my kids!",
            "Contained printing would be wonderful!",
            "I'm a huge fan of automatic calibrations\nI used to own an old bedslinger style printer couple years ago and the constant necessary calibrations were a pain.",
            "I have never had a 3d printer so not sure which feature is important yet, but auto-calibration seems like something that would help me as a beginner for sure",
            "Heated chamber is a great feature. I could use in in the garage winter or summer.",
            "Let's gooooo",
            ".",
            "The calibration is definitely something I'm interested in. Never really enjoyed troubleshooting hi-tech devices. Not sure if I'd need a camera, though.",

            "I honestly love my current 3d printer, however it was a budget printer when they just got to a 300$ price point and weren't giving up actual functionality. So for this, let me just go into what I would love to have the printer for. \n\nautocalibration, my god, the thing that makes me not print more than anything else is that the calibration constantly goes off nearly every print, so I have to re calibrate it all the time. and because my brother moved into where my workshop is for my hobbies, I have no room to actually calibrate from the correct side of the table, I have to do it bent over an old kitchen table, this alone would just see me print things more often rather than putting it off till I can be asked. \n\nthe print bed, looking at it, either there is a removeable layer I can get for it to make removeing models far easier, or it comes with one, I have to use blue painter tape on mine, then struggle to get the damn thing off the print bed. this would be so nice. \n\nheated print area, my printer is in the basement and I live in a colder place, I have never been able to really encase my printer so the environment doesn't screw with prints, while my printer has a heated bed, it only gets up to about 70c before it can't maintain temp, and I have to print the pieces at 10% what the printer can go at for at least the lowest layer to ensure it sticks properly. and printing anything large... that's an accident waiting to happen. having the printer actually enclosed would be a godsend\n\nthe camera's would easily make it so I no longer have to go up and down the stairs to make sure that the print is going well, not that I would assume this one messes that up, but that piece of mind that i'm not going to go down stairs and see an absolute birds nest and tons of wasted filament if I don't check it every 15 minutes... that would be nice, but looking at specs, it has detection for when filament runs out, I have had some of my filament break in the past and gg a 20 hour print, just the ability to pause printing if that happens, or if the filament gets snagged... that would be so nice. \n\nim able to get smaller diameter nozzles, and also able to get larger ones as well, that would be a big step up from current, especially because I print functional parts, it would be nice to be able to use a .8 just for the extra size and speed for parts that don't need clean surface details a smaller diameter would provide. \n\nthe speed it moves at is substantially faster than I am currently able to print, I believe when we print currently we only go at 80-120mms, this ones seems to do 600mm.\n\ngiven where I live we have power outs, I usually have to plan a larger print to the weather, while a ups would be for the best and I have been dragging myself on getting one, this printer would at least give me some piece of mind that I would waste another 20$ and 18 hours on a print again. \n\nit seems to have some internal storage as well as taking thumb drives... my current printer uses a micro sd, god how I hate micro sds, I have yet to have one from any brand not decided it no longer wishes to live, and if I am reading this correctly, this can have prints put on it wirelessly, that would honestly be a godsend. \n\nwhile its marginally smaller build area than mine, it more than makes up for size in pretty much every single way I could want.",

They have a track record of being reliable machines, which, combined with the heavy duty temperatures and QoL features like high-res camera makes it a dream. Usually you only get one or the other in consumer machines, reliable basic printer, or high powered beast with a down-time of 50%...",

Been looking for a new e-bike ever since i tore some muscles in my knee, it's been very difficult getting back into biking and i've been wanting an e-bike so i can still ride again.

I live on the bottom of a hill and most of my trips involve going up that hill and then it's all mostly flat with bike lanes. I've tried a normal bike but getting over the hill is a horrible experience which is why an e-bike would be ideal for me so I can finally stop being reliant on buses. Good luck to all!",

All of that exercise and heat...it just gets to be too much.\n\nWith an E-Bike I would be able to continue to enjoy riding all while not letting the heat beat me. But what's great about that is I could still get the heart pumping.",

            "Whoa. I'm excited about it because it would make taking public transit more viable. Public transit where I live is pretty good, but I often encounter a first or last mile probl that doubles the total travel time.",
            "This is a really cool idea to give away an e-bike, my manual bike broke a while back literally the main bar snapped LOL, it was really cheap and lasted a few years, so a e-bike would be a great win, especially with getting around in the neighborhood, i love going green but ya i'm not gonna afford an ebike any time soon their out of my range cost wise right now",

            "I would need this to commute to school and my part time.",
            "An Ebike would be ace for getting around for those slightly longer distances!",

            "My knees!",
            "I'd love an e-bike to commute to a new job at my local airport. I live near it (and get woken up around 5 AM every morning by it) but it would still help for an economical commute to it.",
            "These would be cool to take with us on RV trips.",
            "I ride a bike pretty much every weekday to get around, and an e-bike would help extend my range so that I don't need to pay to get to the grocery store and other places I go to regularly.",
            "Very cool for a commute",
            "Would love to have such a nice compact bike for riding around areas of my town that are congested with automotive traffic. Would enable me to park further away from my destination, saving money and time. Just pop that sweet little bike out of the trunk and off I would go. I donate a good bit of my time taking photo and video of street art to public arts charities and this would make it so easy to get from one art piece to the next.",

            "I do own an adult trike, upgrading to an Ebike makes a lot of sense and it would help me out a ton to get more places and extending my distance a little.\n\nI am in the market for a trike honestly, that said this would still help a lot.",
            "Bikes are expensive so getting a new e-bike would be great to get back into exercise",
            "Would love to give this a try. Commute is short enough to where this would make a huge difference, and I'm interested to see how the battery life is.",
            "I would love the opportunity to win an ebike so that I can take my daughter around the neighborhood and through the city.  She hates being cooped up inside and despite that I take her out on walks, this would let us venture further than just a few blocks.",
            "Excited to be able to replace car trips with E-bike trips. I'll also be more likely to actually get out there and ride.",

Now that I work in a profession where appearance matters, I'm reluctant to arrive to work sweaty as there are no showers available. An e-bike would get me back into my beloved habit of biking to work!",
            "I'd be delighted to be able to change up my commute, getting to and from the gym, running errands... Would be a great way to get some fresh air.",

            "This is pretty epic.",
            "I want to take my dog with me, I think this would enable me to push her that bit harder and really get a run in!",
            "I am considering an e-bike for running errands close to the area I live. I want to use my car less because finding parking is always a challenge. Also I can save money by not having to fill up gas so often, and the little bit of exercise never hurt anybody. An e-bike is a serious consideration since I don't want to be all sweaty every time I go out by having a regular bike.",
            "This would certainly get me out of the house more.  I live in a rural-ish area and everything is beyond walking.  Having an e-bike would help with small shopping trips, exploring this area that I am new to, and even help with my health.\n\nGood luck everyone.",
            "Make commuting to the train easier!",
            "I'm down for one!",
            "Hope I\u2019m not too late to join. It is still the 15th for some in my country.\n\nI always have been interested in e-bikes (small motorized vehicles for that matter) and it seems like a great option for me because I am moving closer to the city in a couple months.",

            "Ebike sounds like a huge amount of fun!",
            "Amazing, 10 min drives are typically 20 with traffic. This would be perfect for those situations.",
            "E-bikes are the future! We all know we aren\u2019t getting flying cars.. but I don\u2019t care I\u2019ll take this e-bike instead!",
            "i would love an e-bike for the\ntrail right by my house. and it would help with triathlon training.",
            "I love e-bikes and would use it to commute to work. I only live 4 miles from work so biking there would be great to do on the streets. While it\u2019s only 4 miles away the traffic can really slow a car down while I see bikes passing the cars often. Having an e bike would make the commute more fun, cheaper and better for the planet rather than driving",
            "I am excited about this because it would make my commute to work better!",
            "Having an e-bike would help with my mobility issues.",

            "Gosh, beyond just being dope for my commute (6-8 miles) this would be killer because I just ate it on my electric skateboard a couple months ago and I\u2019m still not able to ride fully. Thinking I got enough grey in my hair, and I should ease into that e-bike life :/",
            "I would love to get an E-bike for the house, not just for myself, but for the whole family to be able to utilize.  Especially my wife who gets winded easily, this will help her get into biking as a method of commute the way I do!  I only have a manual bike right now so I could see this being really beneficial.",
            "Honestly, my legs are getting tired, I think this would help.",
            "I'd love to be able to ride around on this!",
            "I would really love this. It would be great for commute, but it would be even better for my bike camping plans. Thanks for the giveaway!"

            "If I had the cash I would buy a PSVR2 right actually now. I'm DYING to play through RE8, RE4 and GT7 in VR so believe me it's not for a lack of wanting, it's for a lack of having *another* $500 in cash.",

So cool how I can be laying in bed with all the lights on around me but still feel like I'm alone in my own personal theater. This is a very slept on use case for VR headsets and something that I talk up as often as I can get.",
            "Yeah, no. IDC is not a trustworthy source, and the 300k units projections from the author of the article is pretty laughable.\n\nWe have Q1 2024 revenue data from Meta, the market leader. Their revenue was up 30% in Q1 year over year (and Q4 2023 was the highest quarter of revenue since products launched in 2016 so the article title is certainly interesting).\n\nWe know that the vast majority of Meta revenue is hardware based on prior quarters and mapping that out against Quest 2 sales, so let's say 85% of the $440m reported Q1 revenue is hardware sales or $374m. We have Quest 2, Quest 3, and Quest Pro on the market. Quest Pro has a very low level of adoption, with developers saying <5% of their users use their apps with it. [SteamVR's monthly survey](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam) recently reports Quest Pro is at just over 1% of the market share of Quest headsets connected to Steam. Quest 2 and 3 grew over the past few months, so let's be generous and double that to 2%. We know Quest 2 was [outselling Quest 3 nearly 3:1](https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-quest-2-3-sales-holiday-2023-amazon) due to its price over Q4. Let's be generous and say Quest 3 sales picked up more in comparison and go with a 2:1 ratio instead.\n\nOkay, so $374m / 3 = 124.66m. Quest 3 at $500 gives us 250k Quest 3s sold in Q1. Double up the $124.66m to $249.32m with Quest 2's being $250 during this period, and you get just shy of 1 million Quest 2s, but let's raise it to 1 million after accounting for those Quest Pros.\n\n**This means Meta has very likely sold at least 1.3 million headsets in Q1, more than 4x as many as the article suggests**, and then we have to count the other competitors in the market but those numbers are a shot in the dark so who knows. \n\nTL;DR: VR is fine, clickbait article, nothing to see here.\n\nAlso one more thing, it's very typical for a new hardware platform to suffer not just quarters, but multiple years of sales decline. This is how things were for PCs and consoles prior to them becoming mainstream. People underestimate just how long, hard, and volatile even the most revolutionary hardware shifts of our lifetimes are.",

Price point - this is a barrier of entry for a lot of people. Ya the tech is cool, but most people cant afford it.\n\n3. Design - most of these things are still quite clunky, uncomfortable, and look ridiculous to wear in public. They really need to figure out how to drastically slim down the design to make it viable for every day use. Also more games need to be designed to use the VR headset as a screen, not something that requires you to get up and move around. As others have said i want to relax when im gaming.

I don't even remember.\n\n\nAlso, had to move to a smaller place bc rent has gone up literally 100% since 2018.\n\n\nSo I think it has everything going against it. No new good games, people may not have space bc money... People aren't spending because money",
            "Yup, this is basically the experience. I'm a VR user, and I just don't use my Index for anything other than the very occasional fancy vr porn session.\n\nIf I do get the itch to game on it, I have a look at games, get confused when all I see is hot garbage shovelware on the steam store page, and then I say to myself \"ah, surely it's just showing me VR games from 10 years ago, let me append \\[insert current year\\] to my search to find more recent releases\". And *nope.* That awful unity asset flip with about 20 minutes of gameplay with every one of that minute just being a gimmick, or proof of concept, or early alpha state shite. I go through the same cycle every 6-8 months or so... And it just never improves. It's been years.\n\nThis is the state of VR gaming. There is nothing to play. Even \"good\" VR experiences are just so shallow. Like, I think Blade and Sorcery is a great VR experience. Pretty much the thing you want to play if you buy a VR headset, in that if you buy a headset, you probably want to swing a sword at some dude and watch his head fly off. But that is where the novelty ends. Once you've done that, played with a few mods, you're just... done.\n\nFundamentally, VR is a gimmick, and there are only a few activities that are suited to the medium. Your beat sabres, SUPERHOT, Boneworks, Blade and Sorcery, maybe some sports games, novelty simulator games like Job Simulator. These games already exist. And they already have run the gauntlet for all the things you can do in VR. Of the things you'd ever want to do in VR, these games have pretty much got everything covered. These are the best games to experience what VR has to offer. So... great, these games are now entrenched and the industry is in static shock because nobody can reasonably innovate past these if they even wanted to try in the first place, which they don't because nobody owns a VR headset.\n\nThe only actually certified good game for VR in my opinion that isn't just a sandbox, simulator, or tech demo, or direct port of another game on a better platform is Half Life Alyx. That is genuinely a great game that is competitive across platforms. But as far as I can tell, that's it. 1 game. That is *rough.*\n\nEverything else is a game I'd rather just play on my PC.

It's still either no releases or borderline shovelware games with a once-a-year decent title if we're lucky.\n\nThis is a perception issue, because the quality and quantity has gone up. Well, maybe with the exception that we haven't had a game reach Half Life: Alyx quality.\n\nOver the past 12 months, we saw the most VR-exclusive AAA/AA/Large Indie releases in a one year period in VR's history: Asgard's Wrath 2, Assassin's Creed Nexus, Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice, Underdogs, Brazen Blaze, Vertigo 2, and in the next 12 months you have Batman Arkham Shadow, Metro Awakening, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and Behemoth.\n\nNone of these are tech demos but are full fledged campaigns (Asgard's Wrath 2 is about 6x larger than Half Life Alyx), all of them are highly praised, aside from the to-be-released games because we'll have to wait and see.",

            "Anything cockpit-based is wonderful for VR.  Racing games have a real big problem with being able to look around in a cockpit view while simultaneously controlling the car.  With a controller and a TV, it's a really odd sensation that never really felt right to me (in part because a lot of games really like to force set directions for you to look in rather than freely being able to rotate the in-car view around at whatever degree of angle that you want), plus it makes controlling the game in general more complicated to have to move the second stick all the time to look around while steering with the other.  If you're using a monitor and a steering wheel, the problem is even worse.  I don't know how you have a look around in a cockpit view at all if you're playing with a steering wheel.  VR + steering wheel however is just magic.",

It doesn't make sense for every type of game, but I'll sit there with a regular controller in my hands and play stuff like Microsoft Flight Simulator and Project Wingman, and just being able to look around in a cockpit is so helpful versus having to maneuver a second thumbstick around, or worse in Microsoft Flight Simulator's case and it takes like 27 buttons and actions to position the camera close enough to the fucking buttons in the cockpit to see what they're for while at the same time you need to be controlling the plane itself, or let auto-pilot do its thing.

What are player look limits? And how do you handle a whole new form of camera object collision? You also have to consider what the player can tolerate. The gap between fun and vomiting from motion sickness is fairly small. \nThere's an insane amount of work just to add the most basic VR support to many games when you are trying to make it a refined experience.",

            "Yeah, I *just* got my Quest 2 ($200 is a steal right now) and it's my first deep dive into VR. I've just been playing a few demos, the Room VR, and some mini golf. It's incredibly relaxing, immersive, and almost an out-of-body experience to enjoy feeling like you're transported to a different realm. There are at least a dozen games that are really high on my list to experience, and I'm mainly looking for those laid-back experiences where I can just sit on my couch and zone out with a fun game or environment.\n\nThat being said, what it seems to me like the industry sorely needs is more ported games. Skyrim VR, for example (which I don't plan to play, but seems like the right idea). Games like Spider-Man, Horzion Zero Dawn, the Witcher, the Last of Us... whatever. With most games, it's probably not a very intensive process to create a VR version. It's almost trivial to do it (for a big studio) for any game that has freelook/mouselook. So many big AAA games would be great for VR, but maybe the biggest barrier with that right now is PC hardware needing to be really beefy just to run those games in 2D, let alone the added horsepower needed for smooth VR.\n\nMaybe getting some older (10 years or so) AAA games in VR would help people feel more compelled to do \"couch\" VR. Now that I have a Quest, I've been looking for a decent arcade-style racing game, and I've been pretty disappointed that there's just very few good options. A game like Forza Horizon in VR would be nice, or a Need For Speed game, but there just doesn't seem to be much of that. It's mostly sim racers, and I don't have the patience, and prefer the eye candy of open-world arcade racing.",

I have a shit load of hours into Skyrim VR + RE7 VR + No Man's Sky VR. I did a full 100%. Platinum trophy run for RE7 from a brand-new start to getting the plat. trophy all while playing it in VR. With how much I want to play GT7 and RE8 in VR, I'd be perfectly happy with those 2 + No Man's Sky for hundreds of more hours.",
            "I have to disagree. Cost is a major issue. High quality VR is actually pretty good. The thing is you need the VR headset, a computer to run it and games to actually play. Endless treadmills also really help with the movement issue. Over all VR is a 4k investment, the vast majority of gamers can't afford it.\n\nEven those who can afford it aren't that interested because there's only a handful of games with basically nothing on the horizon. Nobody wants to make VR games because the market is tiny due to the high cost of entry.\n\nEdit: There's plenty of lower cost options but they suck and still cost well over 1k. I honestly think they hurt the market more than help it by letting people try a shitty version of VR and thinking it's terrible.",

An Index will definitely give you a better experience, but the full kit is over $1000. This is the kind of money you could use to buy a really nice display. It's about as affordable as a $1000 diamond, where you shouldn't even consider it unless you have enough money to waste on expensive early adopter tech.",

            "Yep. I first remember reading about how it was on the verge of taking off when I was in fifth grade around 1992. Needless to say, I\u2019m not holding my breath waiting for VR to take off at this point.",
            "The novelty is based on multiple factors:\n\nPeople expect tens of thousands of hours of AAA content, they expect a comfortable experience for hours of use, and they expect a high quality high clarity experience, but most VR headsets are typically producing visuals that are below a 720p monitor's clarity due to low PPD of today's tech.\n\nThis will be resolved and VR will become a hyperrealistic experience, at which point, I don't think the novelty is going to wear off because... well it's hyperrealistic, it kind of goes with the territory.

I've only had it 2 days and my mind has been blown several times already, just playing native stuff. I have a PC capable of handling VR stuff so I plan to try some of that, too, but you could likely have a ton of enjoyment without even needing a PC for it.\n\nThe only issue with native Quest games is that they're just not going to be the visual fidelity and size of a AAA experience, but the VR experience has been amazing.",

The excerpt said that Mr. Musk had conversations with a Russian official that led him to worry that an attack on Crimea could spiral into a nuclear conflict.\n\nLater on Thursday, Mr. Musk responded on his social media platform to say that he hadn\u2019t disabled the service but had rather refused to comply with an emergency request from Ukrainian officials to enable Starlink connections to Sevastopol on the occupied Crimean peninsula. That was in effect an acknowledgment that he had made the decision to prevent a Ukrainian attack.\n\n\n\nMore:\n\n\"But Mr. Musk would not allow the network to be used for an attack last September with maritime drones on the Russian naval base at Sevastopol in Crimea, the Ukrainian territory that Russia illegally seized in 2014 and then annexed.\n\nAt the time of the attempted attack, Mr. Musk spoke with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Anatoly I. Antonov, who had told him an attack on Crimea \u201ccould lead to a nuclear response,\u201d according to a biography of Mr. Musk by the historian and journalist Walter Isaacson. Copies of the book were obtained by The New York Times from a bookstore on Friday, though it is not set to go on sale until Tuesday. The account was included in an excerpt from the book published on Thursday by The Washington Post.\n\nMr. Musk confirmed elements of the story, writing on his social network X, formerly Twitter, \u201cIf I had agreed to their request, then SpaceX would be explicitly complicit in a major act of war and conflict escalation.\u201d\n\nFrom the NYT \n\nIt's his company, he can do what he wants with it - but it wasn't because of \"contracts\". I'm sure you can understand why it's worrying that a private citizen, by virtue of being a Billionaire and owning the service apparently is making major foreign policy decisions.

Paypal launched him using other people's work, Tesla launched him even further using great technology developed by other people and he drummed that up into the stratosphere by regularly lying about the tech and \"full self driving\" and all manner of other things. I'll give him SpaceX but even then, he's actively tried to take credit pretending he actively took part in the engineering, which is laughable.\n\nI think his \"successes\" need to be heavily contextualized because in essence, he got lucky 3 times in a row (born in wealth, lucked out on Paypal, lucked out on Tesla), then he popped up Tesla largely by lying.

He now says that the policy had been implemented earlier, but the Ukrainians did not know it, and that night he simply reaffirmed the policy.\"\n\nAgain, my point is that he was following the policy which had been previously set, so it makes zero sense for him to risk changing it at the last minute, or even bother to contact anyone to try to change it. Im not saying that he didnt have his own reasons to do so, or that he may or may not have been unduly influenced by russia into denying a request which went against starlinks policy at the time, especially as there was no contract involved.",

            "Okay, just to understand\n\n\u201cThroughout the evening and into the night [of the strike], he personally took charge of the situation,\u201d Isaacson writes. \u201cAllowing the use of Starlink for the attack, he concluded, could be a disaster for the world. So he secretly told his engineers to turn off coverage within a hundred kilometers of the Crimean coast. As a result, when the Ukrainian drone subs got near the Russian fleet in Sevastopol, they lost connectivity and washed ashore harmlessly.\u201d\n\nIsaacson, a well respected biographer, wrote this originally, based on his conversations with Musk. I honestly can't understand how he thought that. That's pretty specific, how does a writer just make up things out of thin air. But let's take it at face value because Isaacson did said he misinterpreted what Elon said\nSo, it was not decided on the night of the attacks, let's say that.\nWhat I find confusing is how Elon first said that he talked to the Russian Ambassador who warned him of \"potential nuclear retaliation\" and, again, he thought (or he says he thought) that it would have been another Pearl Harbor. \n\nBut then he blames Biden because he said that the reason he couldn't make Starlink available in Crimea is because Russia is under sanctions and he needed the approval of the US Government. Again, why didn't he ask someone from the US Government about that? He had time to talk to a Russian Ambassador (and the Ambassador must have been very convincing) but he didn't ask the Government permission to deploy Starlink in that area? \nThen, later, he said that Starlink's purpose and policy was not for warfare. But the Ukrainian Army was using Starlink regularly. So it was just the attack that was off limits, why? Starlink's policies, contracts, US sanctions, he didn't want to involve SpaceX in the war, what is it?"

This is only going to get worse and worse and these companies have nobody to blame about themselves! They've raised prices on everything from water to practically the air we breathe yet wages haven't gone up if anything they've gone down considering inflation and nobody bats and I but because Apple of all companies can't sell the product due to all things it's price it's all of a sudden news.

            "I don't think full VR headset 100 degree FOV matters much with media or documents. Like you're not looking at a virtual display in your peripheral view are you? You're likely still gonna put your virtual screen in the middle somewhere and most of the display will just be used to view the real world with the cameras. With glasses you dont need the screen to display the real world since you can literally still see the real world and at a much greater field of view than a VR headset ever will provide. Same with when i've watched stuff on the quest, it's pointless using the full screen/fov since you wouldn't be able to see most things, I use probably half the screen.\n\nMy glasses have a 45 degree FOV I think and it just about covers the view of my 27 inch monitor sitting at my desk, or on my sofa it makes my 55\" inch TV look tiny. The updated versions are 52 degrees using the same screen. Doesn't mean I can't have more monitors displayed via the glasses, it just means I need to turn my head a bit.\n\nI think by 60 degrees it's definitely enough. That'll be enough to cover like a 32\" ultra wide monitor at arms reach, or just 2 normal sized monitors but seeing more than 1 at once. I don't need to see a monitor in my more peripheral vision since you cant read stuff there. 60 degree FOV would be like a 200\" TV from the distance my sofa is at too, nobodys gonna complain about that size lol. I actually sometimes already make the virtual display smaller for some shows.\n\nSo yeah I'd take a 60 degree FOV glasses over a 110 degree FOV headset any day, as long as it's not for games.\n\nFor brightness it's not an issue already. My smart glasses have the lenses where you press a button on the arm and it switches the lens from transparent to almost fully opaque, they're brighter than my monitor in a normally lit room. They come with a lens cover/cap too to block out light but I can't be bothered with that, the fancy magic lenses are fine enough.\n\nBut yeah if a small company is making stuff like this then im sure Samsung with their unlimited cash could make sleek 60 degree FOV versions with 1440p+ displays within 2 years if they wanted. The displays already exist, same as 4k ones, but they'd make the glasses cost more than \u00a3300. With Samsung branding though I can see people paying \u00a3599+ for more advanced ones.

            "Many people seem to be missing the point. This team have made something that is a big improvement within their niche, apparently, at a highly affordable pricepoint, utilising commodity components.\n\nThis isn't about replacing your desktop Netgear switch. It's about making robotics smaller and more affordable, with a cheap tiny open source option that may also help people with their own projects.\n\nAs with most things in IT, \"Small, cheap, fast. Pick two.\"\n\nBecause this is for use in robotics to join different tiny systems together, small is critical. This thing is *tiny*. And using ethernet allows for standard interconnects where 100mb/s is more than sufficient. Compared to RS232/RS432 options, this is lightning fast.\n\nAnd it's something that can be churned out en masse by PCBway/JLC PCB etc, ready assembled as its single-sided SMD components, pick and place compatible (mostly or completely, depending on the PicoBlade connector), dirt cheap. And it's Open Source Hardware. The Tom's Hardware article on the same subject says the options typically used within the community are x10 the price or more.\n\nFor the robotics usecase (as someone not in the hobby), this appears to be an excellent solution by every meaningful metric. I imagine making cables for it is a bastard relatively speaking, I'd not wanna be trying to shoving picoblade connectors on CAT5e, but I'd wager that's par for the course in space-constrained robotics.\n\nNot only is this a great tool for the application it's designed for, it also has potential usage elsewhere given its size and price. Anyone wanting to link together multiple SBCs (like the Pi Zero) or hack together multiple scavanged off-the-shelf systems (like IP cameras) in a tight space may find this works great for their usecase.",

Custom terminating ethernet cables does not save costs.\n\nEven as space savings thing, the reason ethernet cables are the way they are is because they are intended to work for lengths up to 100m. What space savings are you talking about at that scale? Better idea would be to make the connection work by sacrificing distance, if you only need half a meter then there are ways to throw out the transformers entirely.",

If I google \"network switch pcb\" I seem to get quite a lot of very similarly small parts.

            "While I understand that Ethernet is technically a protocol, and can run over anything, when we\u2019re talking about a modern product that runs just 10/100 speeds, they really buried the lede with that title. For most people, Ethernet has come to mean an ip network that runs over  cat5e, cat6, or similar cable, and is terminated with RJ-45 connectors. You wouldn\u2019t say \u201chey pass me a cat6a cable terminated with RJ45 connectors\u201d, you\u2019d say \u201chey pass me that Ethernet cable\u201d; if you\u2019re looking at a network switch you\u2019d say \u201cwe\u2019re all out of Ethernet ports on this switch, but the other switch has some spare Ethernet ports\u201d. Ethernet has essentially become the \u201cKleenex\u201d or \u201cxerox\u201d of the networking world, where it\u2019s common use has shifted from it\u2019s real definition.\n\nSince they eliminated the RJ45 ports, this can only be used in specialized custom networks (like a high school robotics team\u2019s project bot). This isn\u2019t so much a traditional Ethernet switch as it is a neat idea that you\u2019ll probably never see in the consumer space. It\u2019s like when companies make use of existing ports to run non-standard protocols over it, because nobody would ever have access to plug a cable in there. In a similar manner, this is running a common protocol over non-standard connections (which Ethernet allows, but in these days is very unusual).",

It also has standards for backplanes which are commonly used in blade servers. I don't think the blade connector is standard, but the standards do have something to say about such things.

We're chained down by standards and backwards compatibility and \"the way it's always been\".\n\nI think that could be remedied by making slot adapters (think pcie raid HDD controller style). This would allow new cards to be used on old motherboards. (inverse would be awkward though)\nWe already have a baseline. Thunderbolt 4 has up to 4 pcie 4.0 lanes and a usb-c connector. Video cards could just... run dual cables. M.2 cards could be more easily added as needed and powered from the cable if the standard was bumped a little.\n\nSmall peripherals could be powered directly from the cable and negotiate exactly however many lanes they need.\nA bundle of 8 usb-c plugs at the corner of the motherboard would be able to basically make all full-size atx boards with a ton of slots suddenly shrink to mATX and lose no functionality.\n\nWe would probably end up with a southbridge where we haven't needed it, which is the downside.

I don't think all farms should be government owned or anything, but we should have government run farms *as well as* private. Any well run public option is a good check against rampant capitalism. The government working on budget rather than for profit forces lower pricing from private producers, as well as forces innovation. Keeps part of the market \"at cost\", a more realistic value of goods, and food stamps continues to help subsidize distribution by giving money directly to end point distribution.\n\nSide note on food stamps, which is ultimately an agricultural subsidy: it's a wildly successful program to the point that puts back into the economy anywhere from $1.07 to $1.75 for every dollar spent on the program. Even if it were as heavily abused as claimed by its detractors, it is *budget positive*, the most successful a government program could possibly be.

If you consider flagships the closest one is Galaxy S, with only 35 million units.\n\nGlobal figures. \n\n\nAndroid makes most its market share with low budget, zero margin phones. Apple owns the market where it matters (aka where the money are).\n\nThis is the reality you live in.",

Which shouldn't be possible, so they figure out that while they were trying to make instantaneous wireless communication (and succeeded!) they did it by inventing wormhole time travel.   They were sending ones and zeros from Point A at Time 0 *back in time* to Point B so by the time the ones and zeros reached the other end of the quantum tunnel it was Time 0 at Point B when they arrived.\n\nAs the technology continues to be developed, how much data you can send through the quantum tunnel improves steadily, then it becomes possible to transmit the actual light from one end of the wormhole back to the receiving station.\n\nThis is immediately developed into a surveillance technology and then just as quickly someone figures out since the input wormhole is essentially undetectable and unblockable without a lot of expensive technology, you could put that in the women's locker room, or a celebrity's bedroom.\n\nLaws are passed about invasion of privacy and commercial use, but even if you don't have to worry about your nudes showing up in a tabloid or on a website, everyone knows that anyone who wants to see them naked will be able to, so quite a lot of people just stop bothering to wear clothes in public.\n\nAnd while the privacy and commercial use restrictions apply to the living and recently deceased, it apparently becomes a trend to lock the input wormholes to capture a continuous feed of a famous historical figure's face and then wear the output like a mask.   IIRC Alexander the Great was particularly popular, so you'd see some hot nude babe and look up from her boobs and her face would be Alexander the Great doing... whatever Alexander the Great happened doing at that moment 2000ish years ago.\n\nThe technology further evolves to be useful for trade and war and intergalactic colonization and other such Serious Science Fiction, this history-of-tech part is is basically just the first few dozen pages, but it's also the only part I remember.",

This means their entire body's movements are translated to their VR avatar in real time.\n\nBut there is a whole genre of avatars called 'Protogens' that are specifically animals with computer screens for faces - just like the mask in OP's image. I think a lot of comments are referring to those.\n\nAnother example, here's a DJ set from a VRChat rave that happened about a week ago: [https://youtu.be/nh8PQIcY9xI?si=bXWOgpRdHwWh-Tc1&t=1820](https://youtu.be/nh8PQIcY9xI?si=bXWOgpRdHwWh-Tc1&t=1820)  \nIf you want a fun time, watch this entire set in HD some time. It's pretty well put together!\n\nThe VR convention where this set was played, had over 21000 attendees. In short, furries have had a futuristic metaverse for well over half a decade by now, and the tech is very slowly trickling into mainstream culture.\n\n\\_\\_\\_  \nThe other half of VR avatars are generally anim\u00e9 humans, video game characters or random household objects with faces.",

Motion smoothing uses MEMC hardware and algorithms to artificially boost the frame rate of a video signal by creating its best guess of what a frame between two existing frames would look like and then inserting it to boost the frame rate.\n\nEdit: It's literally from the article, and the key part of it.

Somehow even worse than old janky version of Android TV that had no updates due to the company who made the TV pulling out of the market. Well there were updates, but I'd have to scour the Chinese web and deal with my TV being in Chinese afterwards. Would probably still be better than modern Roku.",

I honestly can't find anything else as user friendly and cheap as Roku sticks... and all my TVs now basically work the same. \n\nI even added a Roku to my a less than 1 year old android tv because the tv's UI was horrible, apps would freeze, it was a pain to use.

Have to reboot it every few days or else I get a perpetual loading wheel. I also have to log in before I can change the input. You can change this option, but it requires you to select your input before getting to the apps. As someone who switches frequently between apps and video game consoles, it's a big bummer. \n\nAfter my current TV dies (or gets killed) I'm moving back to a streaming stick like a Roku.

I know people can be picky about speakers but almost anything over $100 is going to be a massive improvement to internal speakers, and the Apple TV remote will be able to control it with infrared whereas some TV remotes like Samsung won\u2019t copy an infrared remote signal. \n\nMost don\u2019t realize how slow their TV interface is, and how bad their picture quality is out of the box, and how bad the sound is.

However, because of this \"creep factor\" this will be the last Roku TVs we'll ever buy.\n\nThat should have ben an opt-in option, not opt-out and now I wonder how much spying Roku did on the computers that were hooked up to the TV to use it as a display.  And, just like you I do NOT trust that they aren't spying on whatever I'm putting through the Roku including private data from computers hooked up to it even after opting out because of the slimy, underhanded way they introduced the spying in the first place.

I like being able to turn on the roku by pressing any major button, whereas the apple tv I have to hit the power button (fair enough, but small things). The Apple TV also has a few headaches with turning on the TV / auto switching compared to the Roku, however I attribute that to the 2016 Samsung it's connected to, where I have to reset the TV occasionally to get the AVR to work over HDMI-CEC.

Can't let music play in Pandora app while you go browsing for some other content in another app since it doesn't run more than one at a time. Can't side-load apps anymore, they are locked down like Apple now. If your internet is being intermittent, the whole interface will freeze on you, I think it's actually a brain dead web app interface; this was the final straw for me as I use Plex on my local server and don't care if the external internet is down, I want access to my app to watch my own content. Their app store is loaded with complete shovelware, and their wallpaper and theme selection looks like a child's toy esthetic compared to Apple's aerial screensaver. Also, the thing crashed way too often. The remote was never able to control my volume on a brand new Amazon FireTV from Hisense even after trying every software combo. I sold it to someone recently.\n\nI ended up getting a used Shield TV Pro 2019 for $135 on eBay. Multitasking is back. Projectivy front end lets you permanently exit the stupid ad space launcher that's on there by default and make it look like whatever you want, and it's great. Full Play Store of software available, and you can turn off Play Protect and sideload apps like the excellent SmartTubeNext for ad free youtube. The remote recognized my tv's volume programming on the first try. The interface isn't a toy web app, it's android, so it can have android platform quirks, but overall I like it a lot. Direct-Play from my Plex works almost all of the time for my content now, and the Nvidia upscaler helps with lower res content. Can run emulators since I can access the file system if I feel like it, and can stream my full fat games from PC locally or from Nvidias game service for a fee.\n\nEdit: looks like I ticked off the Roku bros \ud83d\ude04",
