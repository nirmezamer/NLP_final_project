Scotland Yard gave the footage to the FBI.\n\nSaudi Arabia has always denied that Bayoumi was its agent. He has long been a subject of speculation due to his links to two of the 9/11 hijackers, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar.

I don\u2019t know why it stuck with me - maybe because I had never seen someone filming in a bathroom or had not seen many Saudi outfits before, but I remembered it. It never felt like relevant information until over a decade later when the more info about Saudi involvement started to be released, and by then, I assumed the FBI would have honed in on any CCTV footage of saudis entering WTC anyway.

Most could not have been used as designed, and when they ruptured dispersed the chemical agents over a limited area, according to those who collected the majority of them.\n\nIn case after case, participants said, analysis of these warheads and shells reaffirmed intelligence failures. **First, the American government did not find what it had been looking for at the war\u2019s outset, then it failed to prepare its troops and medical corps for the aged weapons it did find.\"**",

More than half of a group that already supported Trump still supports him. Thats not a stat of gaining ground. In fact it\u2019s a stat of losing it. To say \u201cmore than half\u201d we\u2019re talking on an individual level that you\u2019re quantifying somehow. So what this is saying is \u201cwe polled individuals in Texas and more than half of those who were previously supporting Trump are pretty upset\u201d which implies nearly half of Texas republicans not supporting Trump following the conviction or at least supporting him less if that is the most optimistic thing they can pull from polling.",

Reason people feel the need to \"escape\" up north lol.",
            "You can sure agrue that, but it isn't a particularly strong arguement. Mental illness in of itself does not forgo consent, it has to specifically impair a persons ability to understand the nature of the procedure, the risks, and the context around why it would be performed. Someone with severe OCD could be classified as mentally ill, but they can't be forced to take treatment on that classification alone.",

ON VIDEO CLEARLY RAPING SOMEONE but but but nah totally explainable, you see what had happened was um uhh umm my DNA was um uh.. like accidentally went inside her and that dude that looks like me with the same penis is just um uh. a coincidence and I'm totally innocent.. lol you sex offenders aren't very smart I see",

For body odor? Even setting aside the racial bias, how does that happen?

Did they go from person to person sniffing armpits and crotches?    \nThen, how did the flight crew seemingly all agree that this was the correct course of action?

They genuinely give me the creeps. \n\nIf you complain, get frustrated, or really show any level of emotion about a shitty situation they get very very aggressive. \n\nI once asked why we were deplaned on an AA redeye flight from Denver and was told \"there's a safety issue, is that a problem?\" My response was simply \"No, I'd just like to get home.\" And when I started to walk away the clearly irate man asked if I \"want to continue this?\" I reported it on their website that the staff was aggressive with me but I'm sure it had little to no impact. \n\nNow I try to fly other airlines. And frankly, I know Spirit and Frontier catch a lot of shit, but for short flights (<4 hours) I genuinely prefer them to AA or United.",

We've had this issue at work where there was no doubt who had the body odor and it was still an incredibly awkward conversation. I'd hate to approach a stranger about their body odor. But sitting beside a person with body odor for a long flight would be terrible.\n\nStill not sure how you pick out 8 people though. I could see 2-3 maybe, but 8 people had body odor bad enough to kick them off the flight? If nothing else, I would see 8 Black men standing in front of me, apologize and tell them to go back to their seats. Pretty clear that is not gonna end well for me.",

Flip onto your back.\n- Calmly swim parallel to the shore. Do not overexert, panic, or flail. Just stay afloat and steadily kick.\n- Once out of the current, swim diagonally to shore.\n\nAs a diver and one who frequently swims in the Pacific, the surest way to drown is to panic.\n\nEdit: typo",

I looked and looked - nothing. \n\nI then saw her way and i mean way down the beach walking over to me. Um \u2026 did she run down there outta nowhere in 5 min.? Just odd. \n\nShe stood next to me and told me that when I went under to swim, a rip current pulled her strong enough to where she could feel it. She tried and tried to scream for me but i could not hear her. She swam parallel to the beach (she read that on a sign walking up to the beach) and was on her paddle board. She said just swimming parallel zapped her energy and she just floated and it took her way down. She told me that w/o the board - she would have drowned. \n\nAnd of course she was pissed off at me bc I couldn\u2019t hear her. It\u2019s the beach.

I went under and came back up several times when my husband,who was fortunately holding my hand, just heaved me sideways out of the current. At the time I really thought I was going to drown there in 12 inches of water, 2 steps from shore, surrounded by people.

We moved away when I was 9 years old, but went back to visit every summer, and I still had my old skills. \n\nWhen I was 13 I got caught in a riptide like no other in my experience, it was almost like a whitewater river. I was on the right edge of it (as seen from the beach), to the left the disturbed water looked to be about 100 yards wide, so my default would be to swim to the right. \n\nBut on the right was a rock jetty, with waves and currents smashing and crashing into it. \n\nMy only realistic option was to go out with the flow, cut parallel once outside the jetty, then swim back in. \n\nBut when I cleared the tip of the jetty the current started pulling me out faster. I hadn't yelled or signaled to anyone because I was used to getting myself back in, but the tip of the jetty was *WAY* out from the beach with nobody swimming or surfing within shouting/waving/swimming range. \n\nAs I moved further right I could see one lone dude fishing, he'd been obscured by rocks until I moved far enough north to see around to the other side of the jetty. \n\nPlus, he was *really* close to me, like 20-30 feet as I passed by and I said, hey man, I need a lifeguard *RIGHT NOW*, this rip tide (that's what we called it back then) is pulling me out too fast and too far and I can't make it back in. \n\nHe said, oh shit, okay, dropped his pole and started running/clambering back down the jetty. Soooo slow from my perspective but as fast as was safe, God forbid he fell and got hurt then we'd both be fucked (him until rescue, me maybe dead, I was *flagging*).\n\nI was tracking his progress to the lifeguard stand, he pointed towards me, I waved frantically (swallowing water because of fatigue), the lifeguard grabbed a float and freaking ZOOMED out to where I was, like (snap) and he was there. \n\nHe was super chill (SoCal lifeguard, dude), got me strapped to the floatie, told me to just rest and float, and also pointed out that we'd floated so far up and out that he was gonna take me around the next jetty and then back into shore.\n\nAround the second jetty we had to swim waaaaay around a [black jellyfish](https://www.safesea.store/jellyfish-in-california/) (according to the dude) but finally made it to shore.\n\nDude took a couple of minutes to make sure I was okay (I was) and the sprinted off saying today's currents were causing a huge number of rescues so he had to get back. I don't think this would happen today (leaving an underage rescue to fend for himself) but this was the 1970s.\n\nIt look what felt like an hour for me to stagger and stumble back down to where my family was, and the beach was so crowded I actually overshot them and had to double back once I realized I had passed them.\n\nI don't think they'd even missed me, as I would typically go if swimming and bodysurfing on my own for hours (again, 1970s).",

Now that I\u2019m a bit older, I care a lot more but I can\u2019t afford to stay or leave. Rent/cost of living is too much to be able to save up enough to move anywhere else, and couldn\u2019t even afford our apartment without a roommate. It\u2019s a real bummer and a catch 22. Beautiful state, atrocious politics, and I feel kind of trapped. \n\nSorry this went off topic fast lol. Don\u2019t move to Florida.

Public education initiatives are fine, though, I dunno who would push back against that!\n\n*Why create reasons for cyclists to be hassled by police? Why create a barrier for someone who is caught out without a helmet but can otherwise take a bikeshare home? Why not put that energy into ticketing and towing jerks who block bike lanes and force cyclists into traffic? Plus, the number one thing that makes cyclists safer is a population of drivers that's accustomed to seeing--and thus looking out for--lots of cyclists, so fewer barriers is better. The deadliest threat to cyclists is drivers.",
            "Sometimes they just start out of nowhere.\nI\u2019m in Los Angeles and was at the beach earlier this week.\nLifeguard had to go in 4 times to pull people out. He said there were rip currents, we felt none. The rip currents were about 20 feet from us.\nThey\u2019d come and be gone again.\nI take my kids to the beach often and always nag at them to never turn their back to the ocean and not go in too deep, no need to be in deep unless you\u2019re surfing. If the waves are too rough, get out and take a break, ocean always wins.",

            "Swim more on the Atlantic side, it's rip tide city over there.  I grew up most of my life in FL and lived on both sides and when I lived in Melbourne they happened all the time, the panhandle too.  I don't remember them much growing up on Siesta Key though on the gulf side.",
            "It\u2019s basically a current like a river but cutting through the breaks like a knife going the opposite direction. If you\u2019ve ever tried to swim up river against the current it\u2019s pretty much exactly that",

            "and that's why swimming pools exist.",
            "I've tried teaching my wife plenty of times too, but she gets too nervous. The best advice is to not panic, but that's hard for somebody who's not a confident swimmer. I try and tell her that if your lungs are full of air, you won't sink. They're like an internal floatation device. \n\nIt's the panicked breathing and the thrashing that causes drowning. I could float on my back for ages with very little effort just by controlling my breathing to make sure I'm always keeping some air in my lungs to ensure my head stays above water. Sometimes I'll sink down to where just my face is above water, but as long as I stay calm enough to pull in another full breath, I'll float back up.",
            "So I can't speak for everybody, but as a kid I was skinny and I never had any issue floating. I have heard that body fat is supposedly buoyant not sure if that's true. My guess is that someone with a lot of muscle weight would have a harder time floating.",
            "You might consider taking a swimming class for adult nonswimmers at the local Y, if you have one. A friend was unable to swim and also afraid of water, but after having kids and realizing that she couldn\u2019t save their lives if they fell in a pool, took classes and eventually learned to overcome her fear and became a fairly decent swimmer. \n\nYou can learn to float, but your wife may not be the right person to teach you.",
            "you use your lungs as floats, spreading out horizontally on top of the water to increase your floatable surface area helps a lot too \n\nwhen I\u2019m floating I\u2019m keeping my lungs about half full at all times and only breathing in and out about halfway\u2026 tread water a little when you need a full breath but otherwise it\u2019s possible to just float there",
            "You kind of can. You have control over the air in your lungs, and more air is more float.",
            "Arch ur back",
            "Do you have a lot of muscle mass? I could float with some effort when I had belly fat since I started lifting weights I've put on lot of muscle and lost fat, it's impossible for me to tread water.",

            "A friend and I were surfing in LA once and got caught in one, didn't even notice. We were just chatting with our backs to the beach and when we finally looked back we were waaaayyyy the fuck out. We just kind of looked at each other like, \"when did that happen?\" and started paddling back.",

            "Thanks, it freaked me out for sure.",
            "None of those. It was a very small beach area, maybe 500-600 feet with a cave/cove on one side that you could walk through to the ocean. I seem to remember it being downtownish?\n\nEdit; It was La Jolla Cove",
            "It is in the Gulf, too. It's unreal how many stupid people go out when the flags are right there and lifeguards literally telling them not to go in the water.",

            "That's funny, I'm in Palm Bay now but I grew up in Tampa/ Pasco. The one time I was caught in a rip current was at Fort DeSoto.",
            "That means your body is close to the buoyancy of water. Mine is not. I'm heavier than water. I can swim and tread water fine. I'm comfortable in the water so thrashing is not an issue. \n\nSome people sink in water and some people float. Holding a big deep breath doesn't keep even my nose above water.",
            "My legs sink and that turns me more upright like a bobber at which point I am essentially treading water which refers the purpose of floating.   Bobbing doesn't exactly work like actual floating does.\n\nHow do I keep my legs from sinking and turning me more vertical.  I can only float on my back so long as I actually kick my feet lightly but the moment I stop that....",
            "Some people straight up physically cannot float. I am one of those people. I don\u2019t have a high enough proportion of fat in my body to float, even with my lungs full. I go straight down.",
            "I already know how to swim. I'm not afraid of water. But if I stop treading water, I sink. It's funny how people who can float think anyone can just relax and they'll float. Every time I sink and swim back up, my wife says \"you didn't relax\". I tell her I was like a noodle until I needed to come back up. She still thinks anyone can float if they relax.",
            "The Y couldn't even get me to float.",
            "Another thing is humans tend to float by default, just below the surface of the water. So if you can avoid panicking, you can float there and come up for a breath every 30 seconds or even longer. It takes practice but it\u2019s much less strenuous than treading water. For reference I\u2019m near a Great Lake so speaking of freshwater.",
            "This is just funny that if a person can float they think all people can float. Yes I know how displacement works. But I'm curious how spreading your body on the surface helps you float. Does that work with other heavy objects? I don't believe it but I'm willing to hear the argument.\n\nEta, don't know why the downvotes. You floaters think anybody can float if they just \"learned how\". I wasn't being flippant, I think it's actually funny.",
            ">more air is more float.\n\nNo doubt more air is more float. But did you know scuba divers wear different weighted weight belts because different divers naturally have different buoyancy. Some people are negative buoyant. Muscle and bones sink. Fat floats. People have different lean-to-fat ratios. \n\nThere's an island community reliant on diving for their livelihood. Researchers found they all were negative buoyant which helped them diver much easier.",
            "A roast will sink in water. Does bending it make it float better? \n\nLol I'm just playing. I could see that arching your back will put your lungs lower in the water while allowing your legs to hang lower possibly propping you up a little. But not for me.\n\nI can't keep my mouth above water even holding in all the air I can. I obviously can't let any air out to inhale because I'm already underwater and sinking further now. With a relaxed breath hold, I sink to 3-4 feet underwater.",
            "I'm not ripped or cut. But I've done a lot of heavy labor over the years. I've surprised plenty of people by being stronger than they thought (I think I just learned good ways to lift things).",
            "6'2\" 212 pounds.",
            "My float is a couple feet underwater no matter my position.",
            "I do use my lungs. If I hold the biggest breath I can, my mouth is not above the water. Plus there's no way for me to exhale at all without sinking. I can tread water though. It's probably like you treading water with 10 pounds around your waist, you can do it nut when you stop, you'll sink.",
            "In some ways it is more dangerous. It is a lot harder to tread water and stay afloat in fresh water. The buoyancy of the salty ocean does help quite a bit.\n\n*edit- My grandma was deathly afraid of water due to several friends and family drowning in the Great Lakes as a kid. She was very pleasantly surprised when we convinced her to try floating on her back in the Gulf at the age of 85.",
            "Worked for years on the beach in San Diego and was humbled by Lake Michigan.",
            "My fear of after started when my dad threw me into a lake so that I would learn how to swim. Could not even float.\nIt was a good lesson, you\u2019ll never win if you\u2019re fighting with the water- life vest or waist deep for me",

            "Some people have stronger, heavier bones. Maybe you have that mutation.",
            "When I was getting my lifeguard cert many years ago, I was in a class with a friend like you. He sank, no matter what. He couldn't float for anything and I floated like a buoy without trying. Of course he ended up being the dude I had to \"save\" and backboard from the bottom of the pool to prove I could for my cert. I did it, but it was f'ing hard. And I will never forget him just sitting on the bottom of the deep end smiling at me like it was nothing while I struggled to get down to him to haul him up. Glad I never had to do that save for an actual victim..",
            "If your body fat is to low to float you probably have an unhealthy body fat percentage.",
            "Because 99.9% of people can.\u00a0 If you have extremely low body fat, congratulations you're part of a tiny minority and yes that comes with less buoyancy.",
            "When you fill your lungs with air, your body will want to be horizontalish due to the shape of your inflated lungs.   I like face-up because of the breathing thing, personally.",
            "Some people just can't float due to their body composition, but the vast majority of people can float at least enough to keep their head above water *if* they stay calm.  Even people who can float easily can drown in calm water if they're panicking.  I think the \"lay back and spread out\" advice is mostly intended to keep the swimmer calm and breathing.  Most people's legs will sink while they're floating, but if they keep a rigid body posture it will slow the speed of leg sinking and decrease the \"oh no I'm sinking\" panic.",
            "[deleted]",
            "I can float and tread water for quite some time in the ocean.  I will drown in fresh water.\n\nI'm not a very good swimmer any more and would sink 90% of the time I try floating on my back in ponds, lakes, etc.",
            "\"The wash\" I'll take fresh water any day. Had my first ever questionable moment last year after a lifetime of being in the ocean. Was already body surfing for about 30 mins and I got pulled into a relentless set, breaking like every 2-3 seconds, so much foam (the wash) it was like trying to swim in whip cream, keeping your head above enough time to get a solid breath was hard with waves hitting you relentlessly, almost got into a panic since i couldn't swim out like i have a thousand times before, the waves were breaking everywhere and pulling you back into the main break/trough if you tried to get outside. Wound up diving to the bottom with what little breath I had left and i kid you not, clawed my way out of there with my hands feet in the sand about 8 feet down (normally at the very bottom there is a calm layer, but *the ocean was angry that day my friend*), then heading to a place where I could be far enough from the main break then push off the bottom for a gulp of air and back down. Out of breath and anaerobic for a good minute. Enough excitement for one summer.",
            "It doesn't help that the water temperature is much lower than the Pacific. It's rare to get above 75 degrees.",
            "That, and lake michigan, even in the dead of summer is barely 60-65 degrees.  Swimming hard in those temps can be brutal if you aren't used to it.",
            "I'm a Lake Michigan swimmer but have never had the chance to do any ocean swimming. Does ocean swimming have the same kind of abrupt temperature changes you get in Lake Michigan?",
            "All the sewage in lake Michigan should add to its density to increase your buoyancy.",
            "Was it just the change in buoyancy, or what?",

            "There's an island community that free dives for pearl harvesting. They were all found to be negative buoyant which really made their job easier. Scientist determined that their bones had evolved to be heavier. I've kind of thought maybe all the sports strengthened my bones. I'm not ripped at all. I'm 6'2\", 212 pounds. I'm know to be stronger than I look, don't know if that may play a part.",
            "I have excess body fat and still can't float.  My legs start to sink and as that progresses I fold some at the waist before it turns me vertical.  I can already swim and tread water.  I have twice had a professional try to teach me and they both settled on it being something about my body as they couldn't explain it.  One of them offered me a second lesson free because he was so surprised but convinced he could figure it out.",
            "My legs sink (feet first) and turn me upright unless I continuously (gently) kick my feet.",
            "I was just checking out a reddit post from 2 years ago on this subject. There were plenty of people in that chat saying they sink like a rock like me even though they can swim and are comfortable. Like I can swim and tread water fine. But if I stop actively paddling, I'm 3 feet under water.",
            "Floating would seem to help you not drown, idk call me crazy.",
            "You're confusing water tension with density. But I've never thought of the water tension angle. There might be something there. So of the sheet of aluminum is dunked underwater, it sinks from there, right?",
            "I'm not a swim instructor so this isn't advice or anything.. but to me the key to lakes is taking a deep breath in and then laying back while giving one good kick.  After that I breathe in a way that I don't let 100% of the air out of my lungs.  \n\nOnce I hit the vibe state I can swim indefinitely it seems.  It's very chill and uses little to now energy.  \n\n98% of the swimming I've done has been still water.  The ocean freaks me out.  There is so much more you can't control.  \n\nI never thought that there would be someone who would feel the opposite way.  It takes all kinds for sure.",
            "Oh God so it's not just me?\n\nBack in highschool I would inhale a full breath and hold it, relax in the pool, and sink to the bottom.\n\nI hated swim class.",

            "Having not been in something like that, but close to something like that, I got sweaty palms.\n\nI'm not the strongest of swimmers and stay to areas where I can touch the sand and smaller waves (3-5 ft).  You still get nasty wash if the conditions are right.",

They could not possibly have foreseen a future where people would use that very justification as grounds for limitations on that right.\n\nI mean, heck; At the time of the writing of our Constitution, the most powerful weapon of war was not any single gun but the many cannon outfitted aboard a warship. Our nation *owned* precisely zero warships when the Second Amendment was written. Every armed vessel bearing the colors of the Union was either privately owned and operated as part of a merchant fleet, or leased by the federal government into naval service. It wasn't until six years after the Constitution was ratified in 1788 that the US Congress authorized the construction of frigates, and the purchase of smaller craft, to form a permanent navy to protect our waters and our trade routes. The first proper warship built by the order of the federal government, and owned by the federal government, set sail in 1798.\n\nAnd even at that point; there were more privately owned and privately operated armed vessels operating around the globe than existed military owned and operated vessels in the hands of every seafaring government combined.",

            "Nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons are the only classes of weapon that exist that can be argued necessitate limitations on private ownership and use.\n\nMainly because these weapons are dangerous simply by existing.\n\nThe vast majority of conventional arms, unless someone loads them and pulls the trigger, are not dangerous simply to exist. You can load a gun, take the safety off, set it down, and nothing will happen. Conventional arms do not present any threat when not in use by someone intending to do violence.\n\nNuclear material, biological agents, and certain chemicals however; these are dangerous simply by existing. Being near them when not properly contained exposes you to immediate and long-term damage to your health. They don't even need to be weapons; many of these substances used in medicine if improperly contained or handled are incredibly dangerous. The radioactive material used for X-Ray machines, for example. Depending on how much of the material you have it can kill you slowly or with a bare few minutes of exposure. We have numerous examples we can point to of people accidentally coming into possession of radioactive materials that causes them and others around them to become sick and/or die, and the most common source of these radioactive materials is improperly disposed of medical equipment.",

If I\u2019m understanding correctly, when the bill of rights was created the citizens would have banded together in a war and brought weapons and equipment from home/business. Since we have the right to a militia, and a militia was formed of ordinary citizens, you can\u2019t take away the ordinary citizens right to equipment and weaponry? \n\nAdditionally, even though we have an established military now, the only way to actually ensure your right to a well regulated militia is to allow individual citizens to keep weapons. The government just having the military doesn\u2019t guarantee anything really; it\u2019s just a pinkie promise that you\u2019ll always be defended?",

The amendment is unclear as written, if you're talking about that. My criticism of the analogy was that discussing potential differences between breakfast foods and how they should  or could be regulated and governed is much clearer than \"arms\" and determining the difference and how to regulate objects that launch projectiles. It is not a serious comparison.",

            "Yes, you understand correctly.\n\nThis was arguably of far greater importance during our nation's infancy, but that doesn't mean it is not still important today.\n\nThe security of a free state is not just against foreign invaders, it is also against domestic threats. The right to defend oneself and the community in which you live is dependent upon the right to keep and bear arms, and to form militias as needed.\n\nAn excellent and relatively recent example is the \"Rooftop Koreans\" of the LA riots. Despite the objections of the government of the county and state, the militia formed by Korea-born citizens and non-citizen residents of Los Angeles is exemplary of the necessity of the Second Amendment. They defended their businesses and their *homes* from destruction using weapons that would later be arbitrarily labeled \"assault weapons\". The district they lived in suffered far less damage than many other parts of the city as a result of their actions.\n\nIt is also important to remember that the purpose of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights is not to *grant* rights to the people, it declares what they are and protects them from undue interference by the government. The Constitution of the Unites States is a social contract between the People, the States, and the Federal Government to define the role of the latter and place restrictions on its powers. These basic rights belong to all free people, unless otherwise specified. Some are rights of Citizens, some are States rights. The fed has no rights. The fed has only *privileges*, responsibilities, and powers *granted* to it by the Constitution.",

I think it is pretty clear and unambiguous. \n\nAlso there is more than just *Heller*. \n\nFrom US V Miller:\n\n> \"To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.\"\nWith obvious purpose to assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of such forces, the declaration and guarantee of the Second Amendment were made. It must be interpreted and applied with that end in view.\n\n...\n\n> The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. \"A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.\" And further, that ordinarily, when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.\n\nThis is where you get the \"Common Use\" Standard in Heller. Miller establishes that A militia was a called muster of able bodied men carrying **personally** owned firearms. Heller builds upon that to say that firearms can be owned for self defense as well as public defense\n\nMiller states that there is an expectation of the",
            "People generally do not have video to prove what happened - yet they obtain temporary restraining orders based on their version of events. The trouble is that the other party is not there to see who is accusing him/her. The other party gets a chance to present his/her side only at a later hearing - at which point they are already removed from their homes, and now their gun may have been confiscated. Anyhow these cases do not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Often nobody is arrested, and nobody is facing state criminal charges.

Since the statute of limitations has expired they are stuck in this trial or no trial because this charge was done within the statute of limitations but any other one would not be. Without the statute of limitations having expired, the jurisdictional issues are not that important and easy for the prosecution to solve. So they need the judge to presumably have abused their discretion in determining that they didn't have jurisdiction which will be very hard to do (I am not entirely sure the standard of review for jurisdictional issues). The other possibility is that some states I believe allow the transfer of venues without statute of limitations issues and they may be able to make an argument around that but again it would depend on the state law and would also likely be difficult.",
