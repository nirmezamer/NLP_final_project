            "\nUkraine war briefing: \n\n>European Union countries have formally approved the launch of accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova next week,\u00a0another step in the two nations\u2019 long journey to join the 27-nation bloc. Belgium, which currently holds the EU presidency, said member states had agreed on a negotiating framework. Volodymyr Zelenskiy called the start of the accession talks a \u201chistoric step\u201d. \u201cMillions of Ukrainians, and indeed generations of our people, are realising their European dream,\u201d the Ukrainian president posted on X. \n\n>A Russian guided bomb killed two people and wounded three in a residential area of an eastern Ukrainian town, Donetsk regional prosecutors said. Five five-storey buildings and six homes were damaged by the bomb on Friday in Selydove, about 14km (nine miles) from the frontline, they said on Telegram. \n\n>The Ukrainian military said its drones struck four oil refineries, radar stations and other military objects in Russia\u00a0in an attack in the early hours of Friday.\u00a0\u201cUnmanned aerial vehicles attacked the Afipsky, Ilsky, Krasnodar and Astrakhan oil refineries,\u201d it said on Telegram. Russian emergency officials, writing on Telegram, confirmed three municipalities of Krasnodar came under \u201cmassive attack\u201d. The Russian journalist-run Astra social media channel reported that Yeysk, home to a military airfield, was hit by drones that sparked fires. Nasa satellite fire monitoring indicated fires or hotspots at the airbase. The Krasnodar region sits across the Kerch strait from Crimea. \n\n>Ukrainian drone attacks put two electricity substations out of action in Enerhodar, the town serving the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,\u00a0and cut power to most of its residents, Russian-installed officials said on Friday. An official at the Russian-occupied plant said it was unaffected. \n\n>Ukraine said it was dispatching reinforcements to Chasiv Yar, an embattled strategic hilltop town in the Donetsk region and a vital flashpoint whose capture could accelerate Russian advances deeper in the industrial territory. \n\n>The US will send the latest Patriot missiles \u201crolling off the production line\u201d to Ukraine instead of other countries that ordered them, the White House said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to reprioritise the deliveries of these exports,\u201d said John Kirby, the national security council spokesperson. It also applied to Nasams, another type of air defence missile. \u201cDeliveries of these missiles to other countries that are currently in the queue will have to be delayed,\u201d Kirby said, adding that deliveries to Taiwan and Israel would not be affected. \n\n>The Pentagon has given Ukraine approval to use US-supplied missiles to strike targets inside Russia across more than just the frontlines near north-eastern Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region\u00a0if acting in self-defence. \u201cIt makes sense for them to be able to do that,\u201d said Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary. \n\n>Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced measures to protect Ukraine\u2019s energy system,\u00a0including protection for power plants under Russian fire and the development of alternative and renewable energy sources. Drone and missile strikes have knocked out half of generating capacity since March, according to official figures. Attacks overnight into Thursday hit four regions and cut power to more than 218,000 consumers, the energy ministry said. \n\n>Three men have been arrested in Frankfurt, Germany, on suspicion of trying to collect information on a person from Ukraine\u00a0for a foreign intelligence agency, federal prosecutors said. They were identified as Robert A, a Ukrainian; Vardges I, an Armenian; and Arman S, a Russian. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/22/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskiy-hails-historic-step-as-eu-set-to-open-ukraine-accession-talks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/22/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskiy-hails-historic-step-as-eu-set-to-open-ukraine-accession-talks)",
            "Russia's air strike damages Ukrainian power facilities, injures two\n\n>KYIV, June 22 (Reuters) - Russia launched a new barrage of missiles and drones in an overnight attack on Ukraine on Saturday, damaging energy facilities in the southeast and west of the country and injuring at least two energy workers, Ukrainian officials said.\n\n>Ukraine's air defence shot down 12 of 16 missiles and all 13 drones launched by Russia in the second large strike this week, the air force said. The air alerts in Ukrainian regions lasted for several hours in the middle of the night.\n\n>National grid operator Ukrenergo said equipment at its facilities in Zaporizhzhia region in the southeast and Lviv region in the west were damaged by the strikes.\n\n>Two energy workers in the Zaporizhzhia region were wounded and taken to the hospital, it said.\n\n>Ivan Fedorov, Zaporizhzhia's governor, said the fire broke out at an energy infrastructure facility in the region and further damage assessment was underway as repair brigades and emergency workers dealt with the attack.\n\n>\"We can say for sure: the enemy will not stop. Ukraine needs air defence systems,\" Fedorov said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\n>Moscow has said its air strikes against the Ukrainian energy infrastructure were in retaliation for Ukrainian drone attacks on the Russian territory.\n\n>Lviv regional Governor Maksym Kozytskyi said 67 firefighters and 12 special vehicles were involved in putting out the fire in his region on Ukraine's Polish border. He said there were no casualties in the Lviv region.\n\n>Since March, Russian forces have intensified their bombardments of the Ukrainian power system, knocking out about half of the country's available generating capacity and causing a severe energy crunch.\n\n>Despite warm summer weather, Ukrainian cities face scheduled energy cutoffs and the country's electricity imports from its European neighbours are at record levels.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-downs-12-missiles-all-drones-launched-by-russia-new-attack-2024-06-22/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-downs-12-missiles-all-drones-launched-by-russia-new-attack-2024-06-22/)",

I've said it frequently here that the hostages are just normal people who didn't ask for fame, and that's really important for everyone to remember. Many will fade into obscurity (like Ada Sagi who popped up earlier!) and they're allowed that.\n\nIt's really odd to go experience the worst thing that will ever happen to you on such a public scale, and when you finally come back to \"normal\" life (which, in reality, no longer exists), you're an international celebrity -- completely unbeknownst to you the last 8 months while you were in hell. It's not even comparable to celebrities who rise to stardom overnight, because they understood what they were getting into when they released the song or film, and, most importantly, *are famous for their own actions.* But that's not the case with the hostages. They're famous because of what other people did to them and that's really a weird place to be in. They have to deal with this on top of all the other trauma they already deal with, in addition to people they only marginally knew crawling out of the framework and everything else that is demanding their attention -- not to mention, you know, *recovering from such an ordeal.* \n\nIf you see these people, give them space. Give them space on social media, give them space everywhere. I'm marginally involved in this space, as many of you know, and I can't tell you *how badly* I want to know if Amit Sousanna's family found all three of her cats at Kfar Aza (I know they found at least 1). But at the end of the day, Amit isn't a celebrity, I have no right to know, and she deserves to have her space. I think sometimes social media has made people forget boundaries and that we're not all to be accessible 24/7 -- let him get a phone case in peace. \n\nAlmog was just a kid who went to a music festival and if he wants to stay that way, we must let him. \n\nI know I'm sort of shouting in the void here, but it's worth mentioning.",

            "Nothing major, but former hostage Ada Sagi appears to have [spoken to the media ](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hostage-freed-in-november-deal-says-she-was-held-in-a-gaza-hospital-before-release/)for the first time since her release. There's a handful of former hostages that when I see their name, I have to take a moment because I don't recognize their names due to how quiet they've been and she's one of them.\n\nThe two pieces of information I found the most significant are:\n\nThis is the first time I've heard of a release going wrong. Adi was moved and put in a van to be released, but then was taken to another location after \"something happened\" and she was held until 28 November. From her testimony, it appears that she was initially suppose to be on the first day of releases, 24 November. For those of you that don't recall, or weren't following, the ceasefire was initially only suppose to be for four days, meaning that Adi was almost not released at all. As we know, the deal was ultimately extended 3 times in the final hour, for the days of 28, 29, and 30 November.\n\nMaking this more significant, IMO, is the fact that there were *5* elderly women released on 24 Nov. that had \"no strings attached\" in the terms of their release, i.e. weren't required to be grouped with another hostage because they were kidnapped alone, or only with adult children or their husbands: Margalit Mozes, Adina Moshe, Yaffa Adar, Chana Katzir, and Chana Peri. Ruti Munder was also released on 24 Nov., but she was kidnapped with her adult daughter and grandson, so I suspect she was a \"strings attached\" hostage.\n\nI'm baffled by this. Very odd. It sounds like she was taken to the hospital where the Asher girls were held.\n\nThere's no one she could have reasonably been swapped for; every one of those women were from Niz Oz except for Chana Peri, but Chana Peri and her son, Nadav Popplewell, were held in the Nir Oz tunnel, so they more or less counted as Nir Oz under Hamas' holding patterns. It's not like when they swapped Maya Regev & Raaya Rotem, which, while never confirmed, was very obvious to me, personally. Margalit & Chana Peri have diabetes, and while Adina had recently had heart surgery, she spoke about how she knew how to manage it and was doing as well as could be expected in the tunnels (the guards liked her and gave her permission and space to do exercises and things like that to manage her health). Which is to say, it doesn't appear that they swapped her last minute due to someone's health worsening rapidly, a la Maya Regev. \n\nSecond to this, is much more minor -- and the headline of this article on other websites that posted it -- was Adi saying that she's lost faith in any peace. A lot of the dialogue in Israel at times has centered around the general political affiliations of the southern kibbutzim and if it shook any of their beliefs to the core. It does appear that it has for some.",

The Brigadier General confirms the facts and explains: \"There is an economy of armaments (i.e Saving up armaments & ammunition) because of the preparations for the war in Lebanon, this is expressed in the fact that if at the beginning of the war 'the hand was light on the trigger', today they no longer shoot at anything with artillery or from the air, they only shoot at quality targets or immediate threats\" At the same time, the brigade clarifies that there is no fighter left unanswered, or that remains threatened, and say that in the last 72 hours, more than 15 terrorists were killed by aircraft fire.\u00a0\n\nIt seems the preparations for war in Lebanon have been going on for far, far longer than the news lets on.",

It's not too hard to connect. It is probably a random clip they found online and might not even be from Gaza for all we know. \n\nHamas would not let the Bibas kids see daylight and to be frank, we don't even know that the kids are still redheaded -- their father is a dark Mizrahi Jew (I seem to recall Yemenite) and kids change rapidly. \n\nAgain: asking questions is fine; arguing about it and spreading it as truth, or even a sincere possibility, is not okay. People are getting so obsessive over it the family will likely have to comment, which causes them pain for no reason. Even if you don't think it hurts, it does hurt.

According to the author, Hamas despised governing on its own in the Gaza strip, with anecdotal data in the article indicating that it was losing popularity among the Gazan population. Thus, it launched the attack with the aim of resetting the status quo with Israel. Essentially, they want to copy Hezbollah and the model they achieved in Lebanon. First, they want to survive this war so that they can declare victory (just like what Hezbollah did in 2006). Then, they want to engage in unity talks with Fatah so that they can join and reform the PLO. This way, they can return to power in the Gaza strip and continue launching attacks on Israel while leaving the burden of governing the Palestinian population to Fatah and other Palestinian factions, while still holding the future Palestinian government hostage, which is exactly what Hezbollah has done in Lebanon. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you think its an accurate detailing of what Hamas wants to achieve, or do you think its incorrect? If so, why?",

We know they do this, as some may remember the IDF found an unreleased propaganda video featuring Dafna and Ella Elyakim last month. \n\nWhen recording this in my journal tonight, I was trying to remember when Almog's birthday was and I kept telling myself \"May 11\" but I told myself that couldn't be right, because that's when Nadav Popplewell's video was released.

Their father is a very dark Mizrahi Jew, after all; my own brother was born with white blonde hair that turned black by the time he was 5.

Back in April Hamas had Hersh say that 70 hostages (at the time there were around 120 to 130 presumed to be held, as it was before the rescue in Nuseirat and the body recovery in Jabalia) had been killed by Israeli raids. I took that as a reliable number of the actual number of dead hostages - from all causes: those who were indeed accidentally killed by the IDF (some were, admittedly), those who were murdered in captivity, those who were just dead bodies stolen on 7 October, and those who died from lack of adequate care in captivity - in Hamas hands. Which meant about fifty were still alive.\n\nMy guess: ten women (the five Nahal Oz girls + Carmel Gat, Romi Gonen, Emily Damari and less certainly Arbel Yahud and Doron Steinbrecher) and about forty men (almost all civilians, in their 20s to 60s). The elderly and those who had health issues that required medication are unfortunately unlikely to be still alive. The combat soldiers and the Nova missing who have never been seen by other hostages or had any kind of 'proof of life' were probably never alive.",

Every update reeked of self-questioning, haha.\n\nA good friend of mine is a journalist at a well-respected Western syndicate and I asked them, albeit in regards to the hostages a few months ago, if they ever got heads up about these sort of thing.

Hamas would hold meetings like this even if Bipin was deceased, but I'm not too sure Qatar would put their reputation on the line like that, or at least not in regards to Nepal, who is a relatively neutral 3rd party that no one has any large amount of anger towards. \n\nWhile researching Bipin a few weeks ago, I learned that Nepal is the second most common nationality of foreign worker in Qatar -- and is apparently the nationality that largely built everything for that cursed World Cup -- so Qatar may actually have some motivation to keep Nepal as happy as possible.

            "I think Aviram Meir summed it up really good in the article on this note: he suspects that Almog will get there, but it's not currently on the table.\n\nI actually work in the Holocaust sphere and a lot of survivors didn't start speaking until decades later, often after retirement age. If you're interested in this topic, Richard Rashke wrote *Escape from Sobibor;* the most valuable part of the book, in my opinion, is not the actual book itself (sorry, Rashke) but where he wrote about what it was like working with each survivor. Each survivor he interviewed has a lengthy section in the back devoted to them and how they treated the interviews, Rashke, etc. Shlomo Szmajzner could be described as cycling through mania, Selma Wijnberg was very open about everything (she had already spoken in the past about having PTSD before PTSD really had a name); her husband, Chaim Engel, was shut down at certain parts (to which Selma teased him about it, haha). Toivi Blatt started off avoidant but came around, Alexander Pechersky was paranoid (he was interviewed in the USSR and had been jailed previously for talking about it, so I think it says more that he was willing vs the fact he was paranoid), I believe it was Kurt Thomas (never named, but obvious) that asked to be left alone, among many others.\n\nI imagine the returned hostages will all fall on this spectrum; we'll have the Selma's who, after a few decades, make peace with the trauma and speak about it. We'll have the Kurt's who want nothing to do with interviews and testimonies, the Chaim's that are in a dark psychological state where their trauma makes them feel guilty about their actions (Chaim murdered a SS guard during the revolt -- it was an open secret among survivors, I mean, 11-12 S.S. guards were killed that day by prisoners, he was not the only one) and Selma was the one who teased him until he admitted to it, with his name, to Rashke. We'll have the Shlomo's, who will speak with strong passion, but we realize we should probably leave them alone for their own mental health. It's a process.\n\nI think it was Esther Raab who disclosed to Rashke that the only reason she speaks is because they all promised each other, at the launch of the revolt, that the survivor's have to tell about what happened. She said she hates it and she struggles with severe PTSD after each talk she gives; Rashke wrote a play about that, too.\n\nI think it's worth noting that some people just don't want to talk about these things. They don't find any strength in speaking, they find strength in keeping it to themselves. If they keep it to themselves, they can keep it on their own terms, they don't have to deal with Hamas mouthpieces criticizing them (like what happened with Amit Sousanna). My elderly cousin was born in Germany in 1939 and getting information out of her is like pulling toenails. She just gave me permission this year to put in a missing person's request for her father and I've been working on wearing her down my entire life (I think the only reason she gave in is because her 14 y.o. grandson is now old enough to begin to comprehend everything and has become very invested about learning about his great-grandfather). It's a wild trip with no clear journey and it very well may take decades for some to speak, and I imagine it will only be a small fraction who do eventually. The ones speaking since their return are motivated to do so to help the rest, but once that is off the table, we may hear less and less.",

They get painted as these super far leftists, which is true in some cases for sure and makes up a good percentage, but a large percentage of them are also people who refuse to be chased out of places they want to live and that often aligns with the right.\n\nUnlike a lot of the West, Israelis don't tend to sit n a firm \"right\" vs \"left\" mindset, but rather, every person is unique and tends to pull ideas from multiple \"sides\" of the spectrum -- the way it used to be in a lot of countries.\n\nThe only reason it's notable in Adi's article is because she was an Arabic teacher as part of her peace activism, meaning she was a bit deeper into that activism than most others.\n\nETA: I'm a really big fan of the election maps on the \\*Hebrew\\* Wiki for the 2022 Elections, I think they help paint the picture:\n\n[here's the voting map for Likud](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Likud_%28ha%27Likud%29_electoral_support_in_the_elections_to_the_25th_Knesset.jpg) and you'll be shocked to see quite a bit of red in those southern Kibbutzim, particularly Alumim, but also the cities of Ofakim and Sderot (all of which were hit hard on 7 Oct), but you'll notice that every kibbutzim hit on 7 Oct had between 5-15% Likud voters.\n\nBut this is Israel, we literally have dozens of political parties, so some others i found notable:\n\n[Religious Zionism map ](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Religious_Zionism-Otzma_Yehudit_%28ha%27Tzionut_ha%27Datit-Otzma_Yehudit%29_electoral_support_in_the_elections_to_the_25th_Knesset.jpg)-- registers at 5-15% depending on the kibbutz\n\n[Shas](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Shas_electoral_support_in_the_elections_to_the_25th_Knesset.jpg)\n\nAnd of course, [the full map. ](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Political_profiling_of_the_statistical_areas_in_the_elections_to_the_25th_Knesset.jpg)\n\nWhat's fascinating about this map is that all of the kibbutzim that were heavily effected on 7 Oct, were so split politically they are colored \"no dominant political party\": Nahal Oz, Kerem Shalom, Holit, Ein HaBesor, Sufa, Urim, Kfar Aza, Mefalsim, Nir Am, Netiv Ha'Asara.\n\nAlumim  & Shlomit are straight up on the right. As are Ofakim and Sderot.\n\nThe only heavily attacked kibbutzim that are largely on the left is Nir Oz, Be'eri, Nirim. There were smaller attacks at Nir Yitzhak, Ein HaShlosha, Kisufim, Magen, and Re'im.\n\nIt's much more divided than the media narrative made it seem in October.",

Perhaps \"speculation\" wasn't the best word I could have used in my OP since speculation in the truest definition of the word is to be expected, but it should be based only on reasonable/related things (i.e. I presume the Bibas kids don't go outside because all the other children who were released reported that they were not allowed to go outside). Not, \"this random Twitter accounted shared a video with two red haired children, so this must be Ariel and Kfir\". Again, asking about it okay, but claiming it as fact is when things get rough. \n\nI think most people, even if this line is hard to define with words, have a good gut feeling of when they are dancing around it. I wake up to DM's from people every day that say things like, \"I noticed xyz and was curious but it felt wrong to post it publicly\" and that's kind of what I'm getting at. We're only human to think about these things, but once we share it, there's nothing stopping our comments from ending up in a viral TikTok video, Tweet, or DailyMail article and getting back to the families and hurting them in the process.",
            "No. There's not great words to describe these things, hence some of the confusion, so I'll do my best:\n\nThe families, including the Silberman and Bibas families, have issue will people taking unofficial information and running with it and plastering it everywhere -- including this video. This video came from an unverified random twitter user and is not actually the Bibas kids, just people claiming the two kids are Ariel and Kfir. The same way that people in that tweet were claiming that the Bibas family announced the deaths of Kfir, Ariel, and Shiri -- it never happened. Only Hamas said that.\n\nTalking about \"if the kids see the daylight\" like I wrote, is based on the testimonies of returned hostages and their experiences in captivity and comes from an official source, including the IDF.\n\nIt is worth noting that there will always be discourse when someone is in the news and that's to be expected; talking about if you believe the Hamas announcement, for example, is expected discourse and is within the realm of what we expect as families.\n\nWhat is out of bounds is when people believe random twitter users and create falsehoods (like \"The Bibas family confirmed the deaths of Shiri, Kfir, and Ariel\") and repeating it ad nauseam without fact checking themselves. I wrote this post specifically because someone in a different sub was very insistent on the fact that this video was absolutely Kfir and Ariel and wouldn't take anyone's opinions otherwise. That's when this veered from a gray area in the \"discourse/discussion\" category and went right into disrespectful. A few months ago I saw a thread where people were guessing which hostages, by name, they suspected were pregnant and were arguing with anyone who tried to tell them otherwise and that also falls into this category -- I see this sort of thing a lot.\n\nIt's a thin line that is hard to find words for, but is pretty obvious in action and when you read it or see it and I think many people have often had a gut instinct on when they're close to the line.\n\nETA: And as someone who saw a bunch of wild things about my relative on the internet, while I only speak for myself personally and not for other families, much less the entirely of my own family, obviously, I never minded people asking for information about something they saw and/or people proving why something was fake and related discourse. It's when people got rude and stubborn (and not just \"oh I disagree\" but more like \"no, this is real because that isn't true!\") that felt like a gut punch. Unless it comes from the mouths of the IDF, and to a slightly lesser degree, the families (or hostages themselves if they've returned), then we can't say anything is certain.",

The IDF's wording at that press conference usually comes before the announcement and I suspect we'll see it soon enough.",

Apparently the topic of Qatar's treatment of foreign workers was actually the premise of the most recent meeting that the Nepalese government official had with Qatar, and he turned it into speaking about Bipin, too.\n\nIt seems that both parties are aware of the issue and I am somewhat under the impression that Nepal may have been addressing both issues together on purpose -- a very mild acknowledgement that the Nepalese government is aware of all the ways that Qatar is responsible and affiliated with the abuse its citizens suffer overseas, and to let them know  that they know. I wouldn't be shocked if Bipin feels like a final straw of sorts to some Nepalese officials -- for what, who knows -- but I mean, they got Bipin into an economically well-off program that pays well (as far as I'm aware, foreign workers are always paid the same as natives would be for these positions, we just have a manpower shortage. I know Bipin was on a student program so it was a bit different, but the logic applies). Despite this, and in addition to all the abuse that Nepalese workers face in Qatar, a Qatar-backed terrorist group invades this safe country, murders a ton of other Nepalese students, and insists on holding this one in particular hostage? It's beyond frustrating. \n\nI'm not saying it's anything big or important, or that anything will come from it.

Hamas announced Nadav's death in May.\n\nIn early June, the IDF confirmed the deaths of Yoram, Amiran, Nadav, and Chaim. I've been saying its reasonable to fear for the safety of Alex and Itzik. Oded's family has been saying since the winter that they believe he is long deceased; his wife was one of the women released in October and none of them believe he could make it this long without his medication, and Hamas' failure to mention him at all this entire time is supportive of this.

Obviously, \"fleeing the largest scale terrorist attack in human history\" is enough to crash someone's car and no doubt, but a huge part of me can't help but think that subtances (alcohol or otherwise) played a part for at least some people, too.\n\nAnother one I suspect is the case: Keshet Casarotti-Kalfa was found inside the vehicle of Motti Zoherman. The two didn't know each other at all (Keshet was 21, Motti, 74). Keshet's best friend was Shani Louk, and he was at Nova with her and Ori\u00f3n. It seems like Motti stumbled across a panicking kid who got separated from his friends, panicking out of his mind (which may not have involved drugs at all) and tried his best. They're one of the ones that hurt the most for me, too, because they made it to Sderot. There were only a few squads of terrorists in Sderot and they unfortunately stumbled upon them. Terrible odds.\n\ntl;dr: yes.",
            "I see! It was your comments about the pods of three that I was thinking of and I assumed it was true for everyone. Thanks for clarifying",

            "Their job is mostly to pay for sex with local impoverished children.  Ask Haiti.",
            "No. It would cost them way too much money (to pay off a family), be way too obvious to outsiders (the IDF is offering a large amount of cash, relocation, and residency/citizenship, among other things, to anyone who reports to them accurate information about the hostages -- if you're tired of war and your neighbor, who you know for a fact wasn't pregnant, suddenly had two young kids, that sure sounds tempting, doesn't it? The IDF has dropped pamphlets advertising this, which includes full color photos of all hostages, including Kfir and Ariel).\n\nPlus, we know the IDF knows where the majority of hostages are and are just waiting for the conditions to be right in order to pull the trigger. They admitted they have dozens of rescue plans that Yamam are practicing daily and just waiting for Shin Bet to pull the trigger.\n\nIf Kfir and Ariel were being held in public, the Yamam would have been on that so fast your brain would hurt.",

            "The Israel Museum, or the Israeli government itself, could probably open an exhibit with all the cursed selfies (and related images) from 7 Oct. Another cursed one off the top of my head is [Gal & Guy Gilboa-Dalal at Nova](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjdn3h36p) minutes before Hamas landed. I've seen a bunch of them but I'm drawing blanks right now.\n\nThe funniest one I have -- I'd share it but I'm not completely sure it was shared publicly or if it ended up in my feed bc they're friends of friends -- was of two guys hiding at Nova, juxtaposed with a selfie they took on the 11th, in their army greens, and the text translates to something like, \"Hamas chased us around Nova for hours with guns and failed; now it's our turn to chase Hamas around Gaza with guns...\"\n\nSimilar to this, if you remember Avigayil Idan, her father was killed photographing Hamas' hang-glider contraptions, probably while he was trying to comprehend what the heck he was seeing. I don't think people realize, when they hear that story, that Hamas had been sending things across the boarder for years. Kites with explosives attached was their fave, so I presume that's what Roi Idan thought he was seeing until he was able to see the photos on his camera screen after he took them with zoom, if he made it long enough to do that.\n\nWith that being said, Bipin Joshi had apparently only been in Israel for < 3 weeks, so it's possible that's true for most of these men and this was their first tzeva adom. They were certainly drilled on it, made to practice, took a class or two about it and what to do, so it was probably pretty funny/exciting when it finally happened; that resulting in a silly selfie like this would make a lot of sense to me. I'm Israeli and did internships in Israel during the summers in college, but I attended an American university; I distinctively remember signing a contract right after Protective Edge that outlined everything to do in a tzeva adom and also told me that I would be expelled if I went further south than Rehovot, haha. It's been spicy since \\~2019 or so again with the rockets, so I think these men likely had a lot of preparation as a consequence due to their location.\n\nTo (finally) answer your question: I don't think there has ever been exact information on the people who are in that photo and their fates. According to The Guardian, [10 Nepalese students were killed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/20/i-was-helpless-nepali-survivors-of-hamas-attack-in-israel-haunted-by-trauma) at kibbutz Alumim. The man interviewed in this article mentions Bipin Joshi being with him, so we can presume he's one of the men in the selfie. He mentions two dying by gunshot: Ganesh Kumar Nepali and Dipeshraj Bista, so I think it's safe to assume they're in that selfie. The article mentions two other men by name, however, there were certainly multiple barracks for foreign workers and students, so it's not clear if they're in this photo or if they were in a different dorm and bunker. \n\nIf you wanted to explore [kibbutz Alumim on this website](https://oct7map.com/BipinJoshi) you can get a better idea. Most of the deaths at Alumim were foreign workers. I'm obsessed with this website and the developers are improving it daily, so I imagine eventually we may get photos of enough of them to figure out the fates of those in the \"bunker selfie\".",
            "No problem!! The pods, IMO, are rampant, but we still are seeing exceptions; the big exceptions I remember released hostages saying were the Nir Oz tunnel and a room in one of the hospitals (that also seemed to be exclusively Nir Oz; we know who 7 of the 13 people there were, and they were the Cunio-Aloni family (Sharon, David, Yuli and Emma) and Doron Asher-Katz, Aviv & Raz).\n\nWe can presume the Nir Oz hospital holding room was disbanded and it's unclear where the men were taken. Tammy Metzger mentioned that David Cunio was moved through the tunnel they were in (Yarden Bibas apparently had a breakdown when Hamas let him stop for a visit -- reportedly the two are best friends -- but wouldn't let him stay there. Yarden apparently even offered to share his mattress and food with David and Hamas denied it).\n\nThere have been some exceptions: a lot of the released November hostages weren't held with other people until right before their release; Dafna & Ella Elyakim and Mia Schem come to mind in particular as people who were held alone until the last week or two. We also know that Noa now was held alone for some time, and I'm sure we'll learn eventually.\n\nThe pods still do seem to be holding strong, as the rescue from last week showed, but there are still exceptions -- I think the exceptions are part of the reason the pods stick out to me so much, honestly, because these pods are so consistent for a large portion of people, but then there's a few groups of outliers and I'm not sure what to make of it at all.\n\nQuick ETA: the one outlier to the pod theory that I just thought of, is the case of Omer Shem-Tov and Itai & Maya Regev. The three weren't held together, but were held close enough that Hamas made Itai go hold his sister down when she was screaming in pain during a dressing change. Itai said something like, he was having a hard time being able to hear her in pain and not knowing what was happening to her when he could hear her, and between that and Hamas wanting her to shut up, they made Itai go help. \n\nWith that being said, it's within the realm of possibility that there was a 3rd person with Omer and Itai and that they just weren't mentioned, which would mean pod theory is holding strong.",

            "Damn man, I'm an Australian with mixed heritage, part of that being Lebanese. \n\n\nAnd I have to say that it's super disheartening to see that people share this sentiment about members of my culture seemingly failing to integrate into society somehow, or otherwise only mixing with their own as you put it. \n\n\nI'm sure there has been plenty of causes for this type of racial denigration to have embedded itself as the commonly shared view of Lebanese immigrants and I won't bother attempting to argue against it, as ultimately that is not the intent of my message here. \n\n\nWhat I'd like to convey is that I hope you understand how much it sucks to be told that type of thing (we only mix with our own or we've failed to assimilate to the Australian way of life so to speak). My grandparents immigrated here from Lebanon in the late 50's, worked damn hard to establish a home for the family, made many a friend of every race or creed along the way and always made sure to drill into our heads that we were blessed to be living in this country and that we had much to owe to Australia which had become their new home. \n\n\nMy father and his siblings were raised in Redfern, where my grandparents were eventually able to set themselves up running a small convenience store for many years, while my father, my aunt's and uncles all grew up proud of our cultural heritage but ingrained and invested into the culture of the Australian society. My dad played footie for the Rabbitohs and despite copping his fair share of racism on the field, he only ever saw it as the price of admission to play a sport he loved with friends, teammates, fans and hero's all the bigger part of the experience, allowing him to make earnest and heartfelt connections with many of the people he met on that journey. \n\n\nHe'd often laugh and recount how back in those days, the Lebanese people found an unlikely kinship with the Aboriginal community, with whom they bonded over a shared disdain for their heritage amongst a larger part of the community at the time. I grew up calling many Aboriginal friends of the family either aunt or uncle as a result. \n\n\nTwo generations on and although I've never even set foot in Lebanon, you can be sure that \"being a Leb\" is the typecast role I find myself shoehorned into by default when it comes time pass judgement on my character without the due diligence of getting to know me as a human. \n\n\nAlthough I remain indifferent as a product of the society in which I was raised, with no experience of the culture abroad, particularly absent any time spent in Lebanon, nonetheless it is difficult to be confronted with the assertion that I'm not really a true member of Australian society due to my ethnic heritage. \n\n\nAnd whilst I'm proud of that heritage, embracing the beauty of its history and complexity of its traditions, I would be remiss to ignore the fact that should I ever visit Lebanon, neither my friends or family there would consider me Lebanese - simply put they'd classify me as Australian, as that is where I was born and raised and is the country I call home. \n\n\nSo, I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that despite your views or beliefs on where Lebanese immigrants or their descendants fit within society in Sydney or even Australia as a whole, it's kind of tough living a life just trying to embrace the culture I've grown up in and just wanting to be seen as me and nothing but. I'd love to tell you that I don't get selected for a random search going through an airport every single time - so much so that I'm truly starting to question whether it actually should be considered random - however I find it more important to tell you that, guess what? I get it! I'm not even mad, as if it constitutes the safety of my fellow countrymen, what is there to question? \n\n\nBut even then, you'll never truly know how much it saddens me to see the distrust I'm met with in everyday interactions. How embarrassing it would be to correct the misinformation weaved into my standard WASP friend's impersonation of a Lebo, or how confronting it is to come to terms with the fact that these same people don't share your own fervent curiosity in the nuanced approach to learning new things about different cultures. You'll never know the sting that I feel every time I'm not afforded the time of day or consideration simply due to the physical traits I exhibit that one would be correctly inclined to associate with a part of my familial history having originated in a particular foreign place. \n\n\nAnd yet, I don't seek your pity. I don't seek a sorry, a slight shift in how swiftly the stereotype secludes me from certain social settings, nor do I care for any unauthentic judgement of myself as a person beyond the constraints of age, race or creed. \n\n\nAll I can hope for is that by reading this, perhaps you can understand my place in life a little bit more and how it isn't easy to be seen as something I had no say in... In failing that, I am happy to forgo further attempts to have you relate and would be content just to let you know that I'm trying. I'm doing my best to be a part of this wonderful country and the society we live amongst, the culture we cultivate and the beliefs we have for what it means to be an Australian.

As in someone with 1k votes can get a seat since they\u2019re in a small town and someone with 30k votes in a larger constituency misses out \n\n- the more important issue is that the 40% of votes they got are largely concentrated in the areas of the south where they control and in fact it\u2019s very hard to even try to have opposing candidates to them as they get threatened. So a lot of their control is garnered through intimidation just like cartels. \n\nAll this is to relay the message that while the numbers show that \u2018Lebanese voted for them\u2019, we are in fact held hostage to their control, which is driven by their weapons.

            ">__BARCELONA\u2019S city council has announced it will revoke all licenses for tourist apartments in the urban area by 2028.__\n\n>In a major win for anti-tourist activists, Barcelona\u2019s socialist mayor Jaume Collboni announced on Friday that licenses for 10,101 tourist apartments in the city will automatically end in November 2028.\n\n>The move represents a crushing blow for Airbnb, Booking.com and other tenants and a triumph for locals who have protested about over-tourism and rising house prices for years.\n\n>Announcing the move, Collboni said the rising cost of property in the city \u2013 rental and purchase prices have risen by 70% and 40% respectively in the last decade \u2013 had forced him to take drastic action.\n\n>He said: \u201cWe cannot allow it that most young people who leave home are forced to leave Barcelona. The measures we have taken will not change the situation in one day. These things take time. But with these measures we are reaching a turning point\u201d.\n\n>The deputy mayor for Urban Planning, Laia Bonet, hailed the move as the \u2018equivalent of building 10,000 new flats\u2019 which can be used by locals for residential use.\n\n>Local officials say that tenants will not be compensated because the move, which will have to be passed with political support, has de-facto compensation by giving owners a four-year window before licences expire.\n\n>Alongside the revoking of tourist flat licenses, Collboni announced that new legislation would force building constructors to allocate at least 30% of new homes to social housing.\n\n>The measures are designed to alleviate pressure on a housing market which has seen sharp price rises in recent years, forcing many residents to leave the urban area for the suburbs and beyond.\n\n>Speaking to the\u00a0Olive Press\u00a0at an anti-tourist rally on Tuesday, one Barcelona resident, who gave his name as Alex, said locals were angry at the \u2018massification of tourism\u2019 with \u2018the cost of living and housing forcing many young people to emigrate from the city centre to the suburbs and nearby towns\u2019.\n\n>He added: \u201cThe people of Barcelona, like any city in the UK and elsewhere, have the right to live peacefully in their own city. What we need is a better quality of life, decent wages and, above all, an affordable city to live in\u201d.",

Kids went off to college & you have a free bedroom?\nI know a single mother who significantly increased her income by allowing guests in an extra bedroom in her home via Airbnb.\nI remember first using it in ~2012 & it was normal to ask guests to clean after themselves, greet them in person, a 3 or 4 star review wasn't a death sentence to your listing...\n\nI understand Barcelona's frustration with the Airbnb.\nThey(airbnb) could have self-policed. They could have though 'Gee - maybe it isn't cool when 1 person has dozens of listings in a city where people struggle to find an apartment, let's only allow 1 address per person [or something similar]'. But they chose to get greedy & promote the concept of tourist landlordism.\nIMO - one address per person would be a good compromise in the Airbnb world.",

Airbnb is more variable, I've certainly had an experience or two that were worse than the average hotel, but the good experiences were superior.",
            "I guess it depends on where you go and what you do and what you like to do. An airbnb can be like having a suite. Nice balcony, living room, kitchen, couple bedrooms, a nice bathroom, etc. and I could get all that for a few hundred dollars for a week in some places whereas a typical standard hotel room has a bed and bathroom and maybe a microwave and tv, and could easily cost a couple hundred per night. No space to do anything, no space for friends, nowhere to cook with local ingredients, etc. My worst hotel experience was dealing with filthy sheets, reeked of cigarettes, broken heater in the winter, and a bitchy front desk guy who didn\u2019t appreciate me politely informing him of the issues. And it was like 150 for the night. My worst Airbnb experience was legitimate luxury for a bargain, I had absolutely nothing to complain about and would have spent 5x as much at a hotel. I may disagree with the socioeconomic ramifications but I can\u2019t complain about what I got out of it as a tourist, it\u2019s always been great.\n\nI\u2019m thinking of Istanbul in particular, but I\u2019m sure the same can apply to other places. I stayed at some really nice comfortable places that wouldn\u2019t have been possible if Airbnb didn\u2019t exist, and yet I think people who really want to live there, or Barcelona or wherever, deserve to be able to, than to have to compete with millions of tourists with disposable income.",

Every Airbnb I've stayed in has blown an average hotel out of the water, much less the worst experience I've ever had. \n\nEspecially in the United States, hotels are often relegated to their own little districts, where there's not a whole lot to do aside from staying the hotel. It would be great if there were more hotel options that were actually close to neighborhoods. They do exist, but the relatively few and far between. \n\nAirbnb clearly demonstrated that people are sick and tired of the standard hotel experience. There has to be a middle ground.",

            "Yep. I live a couple hours from Hochatown and the people against it are tourists that hate other tourists. They're the \"my family has been vacationing here for 30 years\" types that think they should get to decide what is best for a community that they don't even live in. They have a very \"I found it first and no one else gets to enjoy it\" type of energy.",
            "Bingo. Large corporate lobby SOMEHOW wins again.",
            "Yep just back it. They all collude because that\u2019s the inevitable result of unregulated consolidation of hotels under mega chains.",

            "He's isolating the city, meanwhile the Barcelona metro has a population of 5.6 million, it's not good to look at isolated housing because the cost will spread across the entire area. There's going to be little impact like you said.",
            "Iirc correctly it's also a way to fuck over the company they work for too. The ride fare is split between the driver and the owner of the cab, which isn't necessarily the same person. But if the driver wants to pretend theyre not giving someone a ride, they could just pocket the total and go. That also means they can lie about the total as well if it's not being metered correctly",

And the city/state can develop their own mortgage system where you can rent public housing from the government anywhere in the state, and once you've rented for 30 years (or likely sooner without the need for bank ceos to get paid), you get a house.  And yes, corporate owned housing should fall under non-primary home ownership.",

            "Yes, and housing costs aren't typically divided up by city lines of major metro cities. You typically won't see two metro cities with an arbitrary boundary line with extremely different costs on one side or the other. This is why the housing market of one city impacts the other. So spreading 10k units makes more sense to look at from a metro perspective than a singular city perspective.",
            "Heavily tax non-primary residence, increase the rate the tax can increase as property values go up, and profits from their sales need to be taxed as income.  Some areas do this but they all need to.",

            "The threat of using nuclear weapons is probably more potent that their use. Putin knows that actually using nukes would be the end of Russia. The other nuclear nations in the the world would ensure that.",

            "Thats ok, NATO can continue draining Russia of resources, money and men. Still a long way for Russia to drop down to the level of North Korea.",
            "Aww how cute. Its past your bedtime. Do you want mommy to read you a bedtime book about the drunken relationship between Igor and Ivan?",
            "We find these terms acceptable.  Ending Putler as a condition of ending the war and ruZZia leaving Ukraine is reasonable. That's a good roadmap to peace; End Putler and Pull out all troops. Then we can talk about reparations.",

This type of post is supported by his bot nets (likely low paid civilians). \n\nLet Putin begin to fade into the nothingness that is his destiny. My prayers are with the Russian people. Their future is largely in the hands of a man willing to let them die on this hill rather than fade somewhat in power.",

            "Putin cannot conceded failure or he will be arrested or dead within hours. The damage ha has done to his own country will linger for decades. Which means such threats are serious. The only problem for him is that senior officers might balk at using nukes that could unleash the wrath of the world on him.at the same time the Russian army can\u2019t keep sustaining the damage being inflicted by Ukraine. As long as Ukraine has the means to defend himself. So both nations are under huge pressure, and it\u2019s a matter of who breaks first. Even if Putin wins though, he will have destroyed so much of Ukraine that even stripping that country of everything of value won\u2019t begin to make up for the damage already caused.",

They placed him on a train whose destiny (unaware to Kruschev) was Siberia.  He never returned to power.  He never returned to Moscow.\n\nPutin will \u2018go to the end.\u2019  However, he\u2019ll go alone. \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa",

            "Putin has nothing left otherwise. His life of battling to the top of the heap hasn't brought him peace or security, or peace and security for those under his power. He only has \"fight harder\". His American crony is going to lose, and Putin is going to lose, and this whole politicking bullshit is played out. Maybe - MAYBE his American constituents have one last hurrah as they bring out the fire and the violence, but that's the last real play he has, and it's only one that he can pull on the way out because the game is over and all he has left is the ability to flip the table.",

            "The statement regarding Putin's threat to revise Russia's nuclear doctrine and his vow to \"go to the end\" in Ukraine is indeed concerning and has raised tensions in the region.

            "*The Supreme Court on Friday recognized a transgender woman as the father of a child she had with her female partner using sperm frozen prior to her transition.*\n\n*It was the first-ever decision by the country's top court on whether to recognize a parent-child relationship in a case in which a biological father had a child after transitioning to a woman.*\n\n\n\n*Friday's ruling by the top court's Second Petty Bench, which was supported by all four justices, means that the child will be guaranteed the right of inheritance from the transgender woman and the right to claim child support from her.*\n\n*Presiding Justice Akira Ojima said that not recognizing a parent-child relationship in the case would go against the child's interest. The previous ruling by the Tokyo High Court had denied a father-child relationship.*\n\n*The petty bench said whether or not there is a parent-child relationship is deeply connected to a child's welfare. Such a relationship not being recognized due to a parent changing gender clearly interferes with a child's welfare and interests, it said.*\n\n*The woman in her 40s had her first and second daughters with her female partner in her 30s in 2018 and 2020. In November 2018, after the birth of her first daughter, she legally changed her gender.*\n\n*She applied to be recognized as a parent of the two daughters, but her application was rejected. A lawsuit was then filed seeking such recognition, in which her two daughters were the plaintiffs and she was the defendant.*\n\n*In February 2022, the Tokyo Family Court dismissed the woman's claims on the grounds that her transition meant that she was neither a \"father\" or a birth-giving \"mother\" as defined by the Civil Code.*\n\n*While the high court in August the same year recognized a father-child relationship between the woman and the first daughter, it denied such a relationship for the second daughter, who was born after the transition.*",
            "Please note that this decision by the court REFUSED the transgender woman's request to be recognized as the child's \"mother\". It forced her to be recognized as the \"father\", otherwise the child would not get benefits.  \n  \nThis was not what the parent wanted, and is the default way in cases like this as Japan does not recognize same-sex marriage.\n\nSocial media is strange. Another thread about this exact case framed it as \"court refuses to recognize transgender woman as the mother\", and people were criticizing Japan as being backward.\n\nBut in this thread, they are getting praise...?",

            "Regardless of how even bigots feel about transgender people, this seems like something so obvious that it shouldn't need a court ruling. \n\nThis person is a biological parent, why does anyone need to \"recognize\" it?",

            "No. It's the opposite. If you read the entire article, this decision solidifies the ruling that a child can cannot have two mothers. The transgender parent lost.",
            "I saw that news in an other sub with more details. \n\nIn short, the first child was before the identity changes and the parents were the mother and the father.\n\nFor the second one, the \"father\" changed her identity and the parent were now two mothers. The biological mothers was recognized as a parent, but the other one was not because she was not the father of the child.\n\nThe Supreme Court then decided that both biological parents could officially be recognized as the parents because you know... they are.\n\nSo I don't know enough about the Japanese legal system to say if it's really a trend as it's a specific situation where both parents are biological parent even if one is a transgender woman.\n\nI'm not so sure it would have been the same outcome if only one of the parent was the biological parent and the other wanted to adopt the kid. Or if both parents wanted to adopt a child that has no biological link to either.\n\nIt's still a small tip into the right direction, but I'm not so sure Ill say it's a trend.",
            "I'm guessing that Japanese law defines the father as a man and the mother as a woman.\u00a0 For some totally ridiculous reason.",

            "I think it's in the bible 2 where the apocalypse is triggered by japans supreme court making a ruling on a case involving a singular trans woman. or was it the 3rd one? couldn't imagine the life of privilege  you must live for *this* to signal your end times.",
            "But if *you* read the entire article you'll see that the alternative was having no parental rights whatsoever, as the lower court had ruled. This is not the best possible outcome, but definitely much better than the most likely alternative.",
            "Correction, she was the father (as she fathered them, did not give birth) but the court originally ruled that since she was now a woman, but hadn't given birth, she could be neither which utter horseshit, since of course she was the parent.\n\nThen the supreme court ruled that she was, in fact, the parent (father in her case) which is what this article is about.\n\nIt was an unfortunate loophole that existed and didn't make any sense, which has since been corrected.",
            "Just say \u201cparent\u201d and it would not be a problem, right?",

            "the article is literally about a Japanese couple reproducing you troglodyte.",
            "So shouldn't you be in favor of this? It was literally about letting a parent claim their child as theirs, and if it had gone the other way, you'd have potential parents who decide not to have a baby since the government won't recognize it as their child",
            "Shouldn't you support this then?",
            "Too few babies to maintain a stable population results in the population decreasing. So long as babies are still being born, the population will slowly adapt to a new \"stable\" ... Kinda like how \"stable\" doesn't exist,  because populations of countries have continued to rise."

North Korea is an ally to Russia, and has its own hereditary patriarchal ambitions to take South Korea.\n\nHere's how it'll play out as I see it:\nRussia retreats or provokes Nato, blah blah blah. Any excuse to support North Korea in a sudden push into South Korea.  The goal being to take the manufacturing base and existing resources in the country to make a sudden, mass push into technological warfare. The ideas, blueprints, 3d printing files, whatever, are already in realspace. If you have the tool and die, you can make almost anything provided you know how to assemble and use it.\n\nSouth Korea destabilizes the region. Japan suddenly kicks into overdrive toward defense, since Russia, Korea and China are now positioned well. Japan is the jumping point for the US to defend Taiwan, and with a defensive blockade present and a quickening to manufacturing weapons, such as a simple drone with facial recognition tech and a kamikaze charge for example, such weapons can be automated and literally dropped from the global windstream, creating an automated bomb war by proxy, only with the ability to seek human targets when they're dropped from a static floating weather balloon no longer carrying diapers full of shit.\n\nThat's just my take with the civilian info I have available to me right now.\n\n*edit* Just so we're clear, this is a stratagem, not a prediction.\n\n*2nd edit* Also, I wanted to point out that it makes sense behind the supposed \"childishness\" of floating bags of poo over South Korea. If the world doesn't take it seriously, nobody sees the threat-level applications of passive engagement. How much does it costs to load up a few bombs to a balloon and send them up in the sky where they'll drift like Chinese weather balloons? The \"western\" world's resources will be spent taking out these floating bombs while a few nations make their move on land.",

It's an insane progression. China used to have North Korea under a ball and chain, where it seemed every decision of North Korea was ran by Xi first, and quite frankly China is a much more responsible nation than Russia. Specifically in regards to North Korea at least - China uses them like a pawn to manufacture this idea that China is capable of diplomacy and cooling off fires. The better NK behaves, the better for China. \n\nBut now Russia is fully cooperating with North Korea, and Russia has no interest in whooing the west by keeping North Korea at least somewhat restrained. They in fact probably really want NK to make a scene and cause issues. \n\nI genuinely wonder if it's a direct response to China not sending weapons. China really, really liked having total control over North Korea and Russia jumped in and stole their loyalty. There's no way they're totally thrilled about this development unless it was all part of a secret plan to take the burden away from them which I doubt. The Chinese government doesn't like when people step into their turf even if they never do anything about. \n\nMeanwhile, North Korea has enough ammo and logistical supplies for Russia to continue the war and fill gaps, and in exchange Russia has modern guns to help North Korea upgrade their army and grain to help end famine issues.

The biggest weapon and most effect is propaganda and being world class liers.  If South Korea sends weapons to the Ukraine then Russia may move some of their nukes there.  The South Korea is allied with U.S. and not to mention it is close enough to China and Japan.  If China doesn't want Nukes going off in their backyard then we have less to worry about.

Letting a brutal, imperialist, and authocratic police state have their way in Europe is most likely a very, very dangerous path. I do not for one second believe Russia - with its current regime - would stop at Ukraine.\n\nThat being said, the thought of nukes, even if only a few, making it off the ground, is beyond scary. What will the reaction be when a nuclear power pick up those icbm's heading in their direction? As far as I know, the US president has 5 or 6 minutes to make a decision while getting to the bunker. Then we, of course, have the UK and France with their own arsenals. \n\nSo we probably fire off our own nukes? Sounds probable to me as a layman. In addition to Russia, we have China and NK seeing rockets flying. Will this cause a chain reaction? Will the leaders and top brass keep their heads cool in that situation? Even if not armageddon, the thought is.. chilling.\n\nI do think the west should get even more involved in Ukraine though. Personally I think we don't have much choice. The slow grind we are seeing now is horrible. And again - I don't see many other options with a favorable outcome.\n\nStill - the thought of nukes actually starting to fly is bloody chilling.",

I don\u2019t know what the Muslim women of Tajikistan actually think about this bill, especially since the article so short, but I\u2019d hope their opinion is at least somewhat taken into account before people decide this was some kind of win. \n\nHijab politics have always been messy affairs, both in and outside of predominantly Islamic societies. Muslim women have both protested being forced to don a Hijab, and also protested its ban as well. This conflict is often exacerbated by Western politicians and citizens who treat all Muslim women as either brainwashed damsels with no agency, or simple-minded zealots. In either case, there is the idea that these women need \u201cenlightening\u201d in the most condescending manner possible. Furthermore, many people on the outside assume these women *are always* being forced to wear their hijabs. While this is often the unfortunate truth, it isn\u2019t always, as many Muslim women will attest to. To me, it\u2019s not right to put words in their mouths and ascribe their stated choice to wear a headscarf to religious mind control. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019m against *almost* all legal bans of religious expression, particularly because these laws are often drafted from a place of bigotry, or meant to score cynical political points. Telling women what they can or cannot wear always feels like a loop back around to exasperated misogyny to me.",

The Tajik government doesn't want islamism, so it bans hallmarks of islamist rule, eg: mandatory headscarves for women. \n\n*That said,* Tajikistan is a nation ranked below Saudi Arabia on a democracy index.

Scots diverged about 700 years ago and while it's very similar to English, there is enough of a difference that it becomes quite difficult to fully comprehend what's being said, especially in conversation.\n\nWhen written you can take your time and parse things out, especially since the spelling might be similar but the pronunciation is very different.\n\nI grew up with a father speaking Scots to me (and my grandfather when he visited) and a mother speaking Canadian English, and of course Scottish Standard English when dad and mum were speaking with each other.\n\nHere's an example of how my dad would talk to his dad,\n\n>Gang ye wull\nye wi the twa dugs an fetch the gimmers and the auld tup.  We'll dip\nthem the day, an keel the yows.\"\n\"Fine.  Ah'll gang roon the hill park.  Yon auld tup wis biding ben the\nhill afore the day.\"\n\"D'ye ken yon faur gate ahint the shuch?

Ye micht need tae poor a dodd o iyl oan the prangs tae.\nIt's goat giy chuch tae turn.\"\n\nSure a lot of these just look like Scottish People Twitter but there are a lot of words, without context, would be completely novel. Even with context it's not easy to tell what \"auld tup\" means. And what's a \"shuch?\" \n\nDo you think you'd be able to accurately follow those instructions if that was barked at you by a farmer?\n\nMaybe you can, depending on what you've been exposed to, but most people would have difficulty.\n\nThere is no universally accepted definition of a language, however, and I'd like  to point out some specific wording in my previous comment:\n\n\"Linguists *generally* define...\" and \"Under this definition...\" \n\nThe wording here is intentional. There is no single definition, but in an attempt to narrow it down linguists use their own for their own purposes, but it is imperfect. Just because you feel you're handy at Scots doesn't mean most people are. It's also important to mention Scots has distinctly different spelling and some grammatical differences from English.",

So was Putin's government, and Assad's government, etc.\n\nDemocracy is more than just the concept of elections. Everyone has elections. Even Iran and China have elections.\n\nDemocracy requires a number of things in order for a country to be considered one, not merely to hold elections. It requires separation of powers (a completely autonomous supreme court, that interprets the laws of the elected legislature, who are a different body from the executive that cannot make laws).\n\nIt requires *free* elections: that is to say, not like how Iran or China can disqualify anyone who doesn't toe the party line and is a little too charismatic or has too few corruption scandals, ie to make the opposition unelectable. Or Turkey and Russia, who jail anyone in the opposition that too many can get behind.\n\nIt requires *equal* votes: if half the country voted for something, it makes no sense that two thirds of the legislature would be elected by the minority. An example of this is gerrymandering; see the United States and why it is a flawed democracy (the 'democracy' designation is more nuanced than just democracy or not a democracy.)\n\nIt requires *free* media: if almost the entire country watches a set of news channels who only push propaganda for one political side, and either not airing or downplaying anything that may cause people to dislike that one side, then it is also not a democracy. See Qatar and state controlled media, or to a lesser degree Hungary and how most of its countryside population only watches state media that focuses on praising Orban and dissing his opponents.\n\nSingapore is not China, but is situation is like the worst of both Hungary and the gerrymandered US, resulting in, naturally, 50 years for the ruling party, which is impossible in a real democracy. It is #69 on the Democracy Index, a Flawed Democracy similar in ranking to Sri Lanka or Paraguay.",

Will this need for clarification be a constant issue? *that's* what unintelligible means. It doesn't require complete gibberish, just that you be lost enough.\n\n>You don't have linguists disagreeing that Norweigan and Swedish are different languages\n\nNot entirely true, there are many that would say Norwegian and *Danish* are dialects of the same language. Pronunciation is different, but the spelling and the rest are incredibly close.\n\nOf course this is brought up in the context of people claiming various languages in China are \"dialects* and this quest to define things comes about in light of what is clearly a Eurocentric approach to linguistics that existed from the 1800s into the 1960s.\n\nWhile it's an admirable goal to deconstruct that, other new biases can creep in and this is clear with the reality that, as you put it, language is a bit of a spectrum and resists strict classification.\n\nIf I go full Newfie on my dad he's *lost*, even though we're both speaking English. Now a lot of that is accent based, \"go on with you, boy\" is very different from \"gwan wit ye b'y!\" spoken quickly (it's too windy in Newfoundland you gotta speak fast or the wind will take it from you).\n\nSo is Newfinese a language or a dialect? Depends on the linguist! Some languages are more obvious, like Dutch vs Germen, even if they're still pretty close.\n\nScots is closer to English than Dutch is to German, for sure, but it *does* have a distinct spelling, grammar, history, and literature for almost a millennium. It *didn't* experience the Great Vowel Shift like English did, either. I think there is a strong case to be made that Scots is a language all of its own.\n\nCertainly not all linguists agree it's a language, but a majority do, as well as the government of Scotland.\n\n**EDIT** to be clear, the point of everything I've said isn't to say \"you are incorrect\" but to share how linguists look at things and how there is more than meets the eye than our cultural definitions.

You want people to be afraid enough that they refrain from testing you all together, but not so afraid that the thought of your remaining in power is just as scary as the thought of trying to replace you and failing.\n\nIf you\u2019re seen to screw up, that increases the perception that you could be successfully beaten and lowers the fear of failing to beat you, which means more people will be willing to try. And if your failures cause problems for other people, then that increases the fear of what happens when you are left in power, which is only exacerbated by the types of purges that are required to maintain power when people start getting those sorts of ideas.\n\nAdmitting weakness and walking away an overt and abject failure carries a very high risk of toppling the whole house of cards that is an authoritarian power base.",

That was followed by a decade of (admittedly halfhearted) attempts by the US to destabilize his regime via sanctions, no-fly zones and supporting dissidents. He held complete power through all that, only being deposed by literal US tanks rolling through Baghdad. \n\nAs long as they can hold the loyalty of the military and security forces, totalitarian states can be pretty damned resilient to failed policies and goals.",

Give me a break, that's not a serious position someone can seriously take. The only reason you read about imprisonments about criticizing the war is because the number of people doing it is so damn low that putting them in prison has zero impact on the country, but imprisoning/killing 30% of the population which is probably majority of your young population would literally be the end of Russia as a country.\n\nI think the only person here that needs to re-evaluate their position here, is you.",

Every conscript in Ukraine volunteered to be there, but could have chosen to either go to prison, or extend their stay in prison and I would have respected that.  Instead, I get to watch the same conscripts die in pain in Ukraine.\n\n> be targeted by others for affiliation and not risk your life for a world that doesn't give a shit about you and thinks you're the same as your oppressors\n\nIf you want me to respect you as a russian then solve your own shit.  You as a russian are responsible for your country.  If you are oppressed, solve it yourself without killing and stealing children from other countries.  You don't feel like solving it, and your country wages war on innocent people, then fuck you too.\n\n> but of course you're not a fascist\n\nLet me check, nope, still not a fascist.  Also, I didn't call for or support the genocide of russians, individually or by association.  I just applaud Ukraine hitting targets in the country that is, again, killing and stealing their children.  The west allowing them to use western weapons to target military and infrastructure targets in russia is also NOT supporting a genocide of russians.  In fact, only one side is commiting genocide in this conflict, and that is the russians.  Russia has taken an estimated 20,000 children from Ukraine to Russia, defined by the UN since 1948 as genocide.  \n\n> I don't immediately believe statistics given by strangers on the internet with no source, and I'm doubtful of figures reported by news articles because anyone who has studied the news media knows that it do snt sell based on 100% fact and zero opinion or selective research to support the writers opinion.

You don't believe internet strangers because they make stuff up (I get that).  So if you don't believe the news because they are biased, and you don't believe humans because they are biased, do you just make shit up too?

French is largely nuclear with only 7% left using coal, the effects of the ACs would be minimal. \n\nadd that the flights to the Olympics are bound to be way worse than the AC use, add all the tourists coming in and concrete that likely has been used to build things for the olympics...",
            "They're doing it so they can perform better, not just for their own comfort. The article mentions it but says consistency in environment. Which for most events probably just means good sleep. But any endurance event, the extra days worth of heat is gonna wear you down.",

It seems like having one location in Asia, one in Europe and one in the Americas would give everyone a chance to watch at good hours every 12 years while not being too wasteful.",
            "If you're going to ban AC might as well ban heating as well. Any building that is in a good state of repair will never get cold enough that insulation\u00a0 + heat tape on water pipes and sweaters on inhabitants can't make it habitable.",

            "Lots of people in the U.S. live in regions where air conditioning is necessary. I live in one of them  That said, an average high of 79F on August first is like winter to me. I\u2019m fine all summer with the thermostat at 85F during the day and 82-80 at night. But like 79F at night is lovely weather to me, but it\u2019s just the principle.\n\nMayor of Paris has the right idea. France should not compromise its climate objectives and record just because of the Olympics. The Olympians need to have a little unity and be together on the earth for a period in time, not in their own little bubbles. Isn\u2019t that the point of the games?

From the article:\n\n> According to the International Energy Agency, fewer than 1 in 10 households in Europe has air conditioning\n\nIn Vaud canton, AC is banned \"for environmental reasons\" unless you offset it by installing rooftop solar panels. In Geneva canton, it's completely banned, no exception, \"for environmental reasons\", regardless of any solar panels. Note that Switzerland already produces 100% of its annual energy consumption in green energy (hydro+nuclear).\n\nTalking to Swiss people here, it seems to be a sensitive subject, you shouldn't ask for AC, you don't need it, it's not good for you, it's right that it's illegal, it's not the Swiss way.\n\nPortable AC unit sales are booming in Geneva, even though they're illegal.",

I mean greenwaahing really is the intent probably, but from a technical point of view I'm in the UK and currently the grid is sourcing 15% of its power from French renewable and nuclear rather than gas, if some of that power was getting used up by air conditioning we'd have to find the power elsewhere.\nExcess power is also used for stuff like pumped storage again reducing the reliance on fossil fuels.",

            "They probably could but a lot of athletes/teams probably have an abundance of fans and portable AC units sitting around for indoor training.  Cardiac drift from heat can derail training so I'd be surprised if olympic athletes weren't swamped with the whole gamut of indoor cooling equipment",

They may have lower overall electricity usage if they mandated high efficiency standards instead of a de facto ban people ignore or allowing just about anything like other countries do. It is possible to mandate hidden features to further improve efficiency like limiting the thermostat away from excessive settings.\n\nIn nearly all cool-winter climates the building standards mandate houses retain heat, while summer overheating is often ignored, so new houses in places such as near the article circle can suffer severe summer overheating. I don't know how things are in Switzerland but building standards should be designed for summers too. \n\nBanning AC when the average maximum daily temperature is 26.7C doesn't seem sensible. If it's hot someone needs it, and if it's not too hot they won't use much electricity and energy peaks will be in winter.",
