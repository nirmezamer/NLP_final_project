            "For some reason I am having issues using SteelSeries GG and Medal for capturing clips for my gameplay on my PC. They will detect the game, and then not detect it. GG just refuses to capture clips of any kind, even on desktop capture mode, and Medal, if it clips, has corrupted files. \n\nMy Apex Pro keyboard is also having issues with the backlighting and frequently glitches and will just go black instead of going to my game's lighting profile or even the default desktop profile. I've done a PC reset (I barely installed Windows so it was nbd) and it's not working.\n\nWindows Game Bar seems to work, and OBS will record, but only if desktop mode is active, I can't record using Game Capture on OBS.\n\nEverything was fine until I upgraded to Windows 11, and then I tried rolling it back and it's still having issues. Do I need to just do a clean wipe of my drive and start all over again? What is causing these issues?\n\nFor GG, I'll tab over to the game, I'll see it on my other monitor say it's recording, and then my keyboard flashes, goes dark, GG says no game detected, but then has a banner saying GG is recording.\n\nZero idea what's going on.\n\nEdit: And please don't suggest other recording software, I want to know what's going on because I've used both these programs for years with no issues and now my keyboard and clipping software refuse to work correctly since going to Windows 11 and reverting back to 10.",
            "Hi, so I'm trying to hit the new elden ring DLC, I played the previous game on an older 60hz monitor, since then I upgraded to a 144hz one, however the game looks weird and not smooth at all, on the other hand it looks really smooth on my 60 hz monitor, I've tried reducing the refresh rate and playing around with freesync/variable OD and other settings without success. Any Idea on how can I make my game as smooth as intended? I heard the disabling v-sync integrated in the game worked, it worked for me in kakarot that also has 60fps limit, but elden ring doesn't have this feature, appreciate any help. Thanks!",
            "Specs: Nvidia RTX 3060, Intel Core i5-10400F, 16GB RAM, Windows 11 operating system, B460M PRO-VDH WIFI(MS-7C83) motherboard.\n\nAbout a 6 weeks ago I installed driver version 551.61( I know this is a late post but I was busy with exams), I noticed it made my games feel extremely laggy and I would get constant frame drops. So I rolled back my driver but the problem continued. I then tried to install many different game ready drivers but nothing changed. I then tried using a DDU and installing the latest driver but nothing changed. I then ran DDU again but this time I installed driver 537.58 as I heard it is the most stable Nvidia driver, however this did not resolve the issue. (I don't know if this is related to the issue, but everytime I use a launcher to run a game a new document is created titled \"launcher\" followed by a number.)\n\nAnyone know how to fix this? Thank you in advance",
            "Hi, here is the spec sheet for your laptop: [https://psref.lenovo.com/syspool/Sys/PDF/Legion/Lenovo\\_Legion\\_5\\_15IMH05H/Lenovo\\_Legion\\_5\\_15IMH05H\\_Spec.pdf](https://psref.lenovo.com/syspool/Sys/PDF/Legion/Lenovo_Legion_5_15IMH05H/Lenovo_Legion_5_15IMH05H_Spec.pdf)\n\nYour laptop has two M.2 SSD slots, which support 2242 or 2280 module sizes. You can expand your storage by adding another SSD from any brand as long it's one of the two sizes. Your Laptop also supports up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM with 3200MHz or 2933MHz frequencies on two SO-DIMM slots.  I personally wouldn't recommend trying to mix and match RAM and instead buy 2x16GB or 2x8GB DDR4 3200MHz SO-DIMM. (The \"SO-DIMM\" is important here, because of the form factor). Something to keep in mind is a note in the document saying that \"installed memory is actually 3200MHz but may run at 2933MHz due to processor limitation\". \n\nHere is an image of your laptop without the back cover: [https://www.notebookcheck.com/fileadmin/\\_processed\\_/b/0/csm\\_Lenovo\\_Legion\\_5\\_15IMH05H\\_Innereien2\\_72310f66ac.jpg](https://www.notebookcheck.com/fileadmin/_processed_/b/0/csm_Lenovo_Legion_5_15IMH05H_Innereien2_72310f66ac.jpg)\n\nYou can see the RAM modules in the middle and the M.2 SSD slots on both sides.\n\nOpening a laptop can be a little tricky sometimes. Here is a video of somebody opening a Lenovo Legion 5: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD-1ThQn4Zc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD-1ThQn4Zc)",
            "The spec sheet says yes. Easy to check to be sure, just open it up.\n\nLaptop memory uses the SODIMM format, not full-size desktop. Ideally get the same speed and latency as what you have to avoid problems. You can check this using CPU-Z.\n\nSSD is a bit trickier because the laptop has one large slot (M.2 2280) and one small (M.2 2242). If you already have a large SSD you need to buy the small type.",
            "Yes.",
            "Cheapest is used, but there are too many combinations and prices to recommend. A ~10 year old PC with a GTX 960 is way more than enough for Morrowind and AoE2, or a laptop with a GTX 1050.\n\nFor building a new system yourself, Ryzen 5600G or GT fit in a ~$500 build, which is the lowest you can get using new parts and is cheaper than a laptop with comparable performance. Enough for what you want, not quite for AAA games from the last 5 years.",
            "You can go into bios and enable it. XMP is essentially a manufacturer overclock and is usually stable depending on you CPU\u2019s memory controller",
            "Ok so do you think this ssd would work?\nCrucial P3 1TB PCIe Gen3 3D NAND NVMe M.2 SSD, up to 3500MB/s - CT1000P3SSD8 https://a.co/d/03ht7qNF\n\nAnd for ram it sounds like I can add another module but it has to be the same one I already have, or change both so they match?",
            "Oh ok, so ideally should I open it up to check what I have then? I've only opened it once to clean the fans but recently I've just been running low on storage that's why I want to make these upgrades",
            "Yeah. Even though the spec sheet says you've got empty slots, it could be outdated or simply wrong. It's also for \"Lenovo 5 15imh05h\" rather than your specific type, the specs could differ slightly."

            "When you create a game for everyone, you create a game for no one.  I think thats why a lot of AAA games became souless and generic games overtime because they try to cater to everyone and eventually appealed to less and less people. O=ne of the best parts of Elden Ring is the interactive difficulty slider which makes it very accessible while keeping the original spirit of the game intact. There are many ways to \"cheese\" the game via optional ingame mechanics. \n\nYou have the NPC summons via ashes that you can also upgrade and level. You have the actual NPC summons near fog gates like in previous games. You can summon other players to help you through the area and with the boss. You can explore a majority of the map without killing a single boss and grab upgrade materials to max your weapons out. You can over level the area and kill bosses at high levels.\n\nIf you want a harder experience you just limit yourself, don't use the summons. Stay region locked and don't overlevel and don't use the thousands of 1 shot buff builds and bleed/frost builds.",

            "Elden Ring shines because its difficulty is seamlessly integrated into the lore and the world itself. You can adjust the game's difficulty to your preference, and both easy and challenging experiences are equally rewarding.\n\nIf you want to make combat easier, you can find items, weapons, clothing, skills, and upgrade paths that help you achieve that (you can literally 1 shot bosses). This approach, which requires players to explore and use their brains rather than a simple difficulty slider, is what makes Elden Ring so successful.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the hardcore crowd that purposely limit their skills / levels to make their playthrough punishingly difficult. This game has it all, for all players.",

But Elden Ring made me appreciate the idea of working to get better and gain better gear and weapons.

The fan base of this game is just so annoying and elitist though.\n\nEven in this thread it feels like half the commenters can\u2019t comprehend why someone would struggle with this game. I could say I don\u2019t understand why mousing over and clicking someone\u2019s head in FPS games is difficult but millions of people every day struggle with it. \n\nIt\u2019s just stupid how any criticism of this series no matter how valid is just the same loop where fans will tell you to get better and that \u201cit\u2019s supposed to be hard\u201d.",

            "I think they overdid the enemy damage in the expansion by a lot. Every hit takes away 1/3rd of your health bar (with 50 vigor and medium armor), even by trash half dead dogs at the side of the street. They've also added several mobs with tens of thousands of hitpoints and multiple hit target locking combos that will stagger and kill you if you get hit. It's like many of the trash mobs are rune bear - levels of annoying. This, combined with graces that are often 40+ minutes apart, has me really tempted to respec into my troll infinite stamina fingerprint shield build that I once used, but even that wouldn't work because they also really enjoyed adding massive 360 AOE 90% hp attacks to most bosses this time around.

People playing in different difficulty settings can still get a similar sense of achievement after overcoming similar hurdles. Like, say there's a boss called Bossy McBossface. A person playing on Normal might struggle against him in that difficulty, while some other player might struggle playing on Hard. Both would get a sense of accomplishment after beating the boss. We have to remember that people have all different skills, and what might be hard for someone could feel easy for others.\n\nOr are we forgetting about \"Let me solo her\"?

That would simply be an \"easy\" starter. A character class that starts with a significantly higher level than the rest, starts with better armor, has a better starter weapon, has a flask with more uses up front, and is loaded with essential items at the start. \nThis approach wouldn't dramatically change the experience, it would simply reduce the potential frustration from people who give up on these games after the first 3-5 hours, when they are at their weakest and die easily from very basic early game enemies.",

There is almost a hardware solution for any disability, you can even 3D print gear to help people these days. The creativity is pretty impressive. \n\nAnd then you look stupid when you have bought all this gear and set up a cool gaming room and then they can\u2019t play some games because the games lack basic accessibility settings. This is 2024, we should have moved on from gatekeeping games for people with disabilities.\n\nBut it\u2019s no surprise that Asian developers have zero empathy for people with disabilities.

It's nowhere near as interesting as actually fighting them and learning the moveset. The latter parts of ER have bosses so oppressive that you end up with the worst of both worlds - fighting someone like Maliketh without summons is just fucking awful because you never get a chance to actually hit him due to him jumping around all the time, and playing with summons is just way too easy and you beat him first try.",

There is a handful of melee weapons, guns, and spells. The game encourages close combat to land parries and visceral attacks. As such, FromSoftware can design bosses specifically for the player on an intimate level. Creating those incredible moments that sticks out.\n\n(Side note: I spent an hour trying to come up a response why Elden Ring's bosses are so problematic.

In DS3 a magic build was easy at the start, then became pretty rough going until you get quite a bit further in the game. Even then at no point you start 2-3 shotting bosses or anything.\n\nThe real difference in ER is the ability for the player to summon NPC helpers at any time in a boss fight. In previous From games, the player was always solo unless they summoned another player or NPC player before the fight. To compensate for this, the game scaled the boss level by the number of players. By comparison, I think spirit ash summons in ER don't scale the boss level in the same way.\n\nSo From has started building those fights around the idea that players will summon help. Only problem is that they did absolutely nothing to overhaul the enemy AI to be able to handle this. It's still the same where a boss will focus on one enemy at a time while the rest can safely whittle down its health. \n\nInstead they decided to throw those long winded attacks to catch veteran players used to dodging anything, added a lot more long combos, AOE and grab attacks, and made the average boss health pool pretty large.

I just happen to be responding to your comment. I hope this doesn't come across as gatekeep-y, I just like when game devs make their games exactly as they want, damn the conventions.",

            "Regarding your second point, it's just wrong. It is an extremely common issue that you don't know what difficulty to choose that will give you the best experience. They can write paragraphs explaining it, and you won't know until you've already breezed through the tough parts on easy mode, or you get miserable banging your head against poorly designed difficulty implementation. And you want sliders for health or whatever, but you're describing the laziest least fun form of difficulty tuning. To do it right, boss behavior would need to change. It would be like giving players the option to play a bad game, with many people choosing that option not realizing that it makes the game bad.",

I've been able to beat several different games on their hardest difficulties without feeling the need to lower the difficulty when I got to a tough spot. I'm sure most people can do the same.",
            "AND? Who cares if I beat the same boss and he has \"lower health\". This isn't a competitive game, we aren't playing against each other. \n\nAdding an option that (for example) lowers the NPC health across the board (or increased player damage, whatever) **has absolutely no impact on your gaming experience...**  \n\nWho TF are you to tell anyone how they should play a game, you're 1 of 8 billion. Play your way and let other people play theirs, you intolerant little clown...",
            "> this task was assigned to the wrong person, which is the fault of management\n\nThat was my thought too.  A review outlet shouldn't assign an FPS guy to review a hardcore puzzle game.  Similarly, you don't give a Souls type game to someone used to more casual experiences.  Ideally, you should be giving the task to someone best suited to speak to the game's flaws and successes, which means using someone who has familiarity with the genre.  You don't send your action movie guy to review the season's most anticipated romcom.\n\nI mean, you *can*, but the result is going to be a negative review because, surprise surprise, the person isn't going to enjoy it **at all** and is unlikely to have much insight other than \"this isn't for me.\"",

            "Not sure about the previous titles but you can create a 2nd Elden Ring .exe, name it something else, and add that .exe as a non-steam game. This method prevents the game from launching in online mode and disables the anticheat. I'm not a big modder just cause I don't like to fuck with it after doing IT all day, but that's what I had to do for the seamless coop mod.",
            "Exactly. I've beaten plenty of games like Returnal while limiting access to certain weapons on my own. I beat the Horizon games on ultra hard before doing additional runs that turned me into a glass cannon. I played Grounded with a friend and we probably would have quit if it wasn't for the option to keep your backpack on death. Valheim we quit playing because you couldn't carry ores through portals and sailing was insanely tedious, although I hear that the option to do so has been added. That's not even accounting for people with disabilities that might not have great fine motor skills, but would really like to experience and explore the worlds themselves instead of watching somebody else play it.\n\nHalf of the people commenting on this are straight up saying \"I wouldn't have had the willpower to beat the game on its standard difficulty if other options existed, so other people should be forced to play on the difficulty I was forced to.\" Shit's crazy lol. Turning your own lack of self-control into a way to limit others is something I'm really thankful I don't do.",

            "How would adding an easy mode compromise their vision or affect the way they develop their games?

Nobody would be prevented from playing the games as they were intended to be played.",

            "I mean who are you to say that the creator of the games opinion on his game is wrong. You seem big mad about this. Elden Ring really isn\u2019t that hard of a game, I\u2019ve beaten it twice and I spend the majority of my time playing sports games or turn based RPGs. There\u2019s so many ways to lower the difficulty by just farming levels, upgrading weapons, busted builds, spirit summons, etc.",
            "Same for me although Elden Ring swallowed my world when it first launched until I beat it. Typically if a game is advertised as open world its almost automatically a pass for me these days. Give me a nice tight well put together game instead of forcing me to wander around doing nothing 70% of the time just to experience the content. ER was interesting enough to avoid that feeling for me but most open worlds aren't.",

I have about 10ish hours into Dark Souls Remastered, never once got past the Bell Gargoyles, and realized that I just don't enjoy these types of games anymore.",
            "Lots of games can be for you with slight modification though, like the example I just gave. That's why it is good to allow the customer to adjust things. That's part of what makes PC gaming in particular so great. Weird to see the opinion that we shouldn't be able to modify games to our liking on a PC gaming forum.",

I\u2019m just pointing out that your question to them is silly. \n\nThe static difficulty is a thing because the devs want everyone to share the same experience, and they\u2019ve built in plenty of tools to make that experience more accessible than ever. \n\nAnd you can always download a mod if you want to play in a sandbox.",
            "Sure, now you tell me why people with that problem should not have games designed for them.",
            "No, more options is not always a good thing, idk what to tell you dude.\n\nGames are all about restrictions. Factorio for example revolves around working around said restrictions, if you remove them, there's no game.\n\nBaba is you, all about restrictions. \n\nIf you want to do whatever then just cheat, more options is not automatically good game design.",

He can have a vision, it's his game but both things can be true...\n\nOptions that have no impact on anyone other than the people who use them.\n\nThis is some gross hive-mind elitism where Souls Fans want to participate in some peen measuring contest. It's disgusting. It's a game bro...\n\nIt's bonkers that someone would be apposed to adding options (look up the damn word) because it literally doesn't impact you unless you use them.",
            "What a lot of open world games fail to understand is that you don't *put* content *in* the open world. The open world *is* the content. Give the player a set of well-crafted mechanics that are omnipresent throughout the world, some basic objectives to lead the player around it, and let them find their own fun. You should be able to remove every map marker, every mission, just reduce everything to the open-world systems, and the game should *still be fun*. It's why GTA continues to be so successful. I've known plenty of people who play GTA just to fuck around with the cops and go on rampages, and don't bother to interact with missions or other designer-made content at all.",

            "> I\u2019m not the person you originally replied to\n\nI never said that you were, champ.\n\n>The static difficulty is a thing because the devs want everyone to share the same experience\n\nAgain, countless people have already chimed in and listen numerous ways to make the game easier. If they really wanted everyone to have the exact same difficulty then there would be one set of weapons, one set of armor, and no XP. Every encounter would be predetermined and balanced around one set of weapons and one pool of health. There's already ways in the game to scale the difficulty, so adding one more doesn't seem like it should be a big deal if it allows others to enjoy it.",
            "> The easy mode in this game is summon ashes or the coop system. \n\nAs much as I like Elden Ring and am more in the \"no sliders is part of the design\", I would have to disagree with your characterization here.  \n\nThere isn't an \"easy mode\" in Eldenring. Some playstyles may be stronger and more optimal than others but that is not what a difficulty adjustment is. Games with and without difficulty sliders will have more optimal and meta playstyles, but the difference is how much a player is forced to play optimally. \n\n\nNot having a difficulty slider does fit Fromsofts vision more, but that does come with real downsides in accessibility.",

I'm sure they made quite a bit of money off the success of the first game, but I'm assuming that they decided not to expand the size of their studio since there's undoubtedly a ton of complexity involved with doing that, and they probably don't want to deal with any of that shit.\n\nThey have already proven themselves in my opinion.

            "As the other commenter said, It's prequel Hollow Knight was an indie darling. The kind of game that only comes around once per console generation. So a sequel would have more than a ton of hype around it. \n\nMore than that though, I think the bigger reason that fans have been so rabbid about it is the fact that it really feels like it should have come out by now. \n\nSilksong was announced in Febuary of 2019, or over 5 years ago. That in and of itself isn't remarkable. Games certainly can and have taken longer to develop. Even indie games. But what is remarkable is the fact that in June of that same year, it had a playable demo at E3 courtisy of Nintendo's showroom floor. Now, I don't know about you, but if a game has a playable demo available at what was the biggest gaming event of the time? I would feel fairly confident that it was getting pretty close to completion. Within a couple years atleast. \n\nAnd then, 3 years later, we got a new trailer for Silksong through Xbox's June 2022 showcase. And it should be stressed that Microsoft actively advertised that anything you saw in the showcase would be released within 12 months of it. So we DID have a general release window from that trailer. But, as you've gathered, it hasn't released. The game was delayed and; if memory serves; Team Cherry didn't announce this fact until  the very end of the 12 month window; if not after it had already passed. \n\nBut to top it all off, The Developers; Team Cherry; have been *remarkably* silent about the whole ordeal. When you see people complain about \"radio silence\"? That's not an exaggeration. I think we've gotten maybe... four big news drops sense it's reveal? The E3 Demo, the Xbox trailer, an article in Edge Magazine from early 2021, and a Blog Post about a year after the reveal trailer. That's at best a single news drop per year at the current rate.

            "Yes, and the only reason Hollow Knight even released when it did was because the dev team was running out of money. No chance of that this time around, they are all multi-millionaires. They can work on it as long as they like.",
            "I mean, the first game took them 3-4 years to make, and based on what the developers have said, Silksong is about 2-3 times bigger. From the outside looking in, the development time for Silksong seems to track.\n\nI'm not saying it's ideal. Seven years is a long time for any game. But I just think people have unrealistic expectations for a 3-man dev team. We don't know what kind of work schedule they operate on or what kind of things they deal with outside of work that might eat in to development time. Bigger studios that rely on crunch can deal with that more easily, but someone on a 3-man team being out of work for whatever reason is probably going to impact the speed of development more noticeably.\n\nIf these guys are trying to stick to 40 hour work weeks and are taking vacations and sick days at a reasonable rate then it makes sense to me why it would take them such a long time to finish this game, if it's as big as they say it is.",
            ">What it was supposed to be, and what people paid for, was DLC for the first game. \n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but the Hornet DLC was a funding milestone (the $56K milestone) that was reached during the course of the campaign. Nobody paid for the Hornet DLC specifically. If you pledged $10 (the lowest pledge option available) or more, you received a digital copy of Hollow Knight and the Hornet DLC would be a free add-on once it was released. I suppose if people are upset and complaining that they didn't get their full $10 worth out of Hollow Knight because it never got the Hornet DLC then that's one thing. But I just don't see how the base game alone is not a high enough value that it honors the minimum $10 pledge.\n\nRegardless, I can agree that there's still a void here that needs filling. The right thing for Team Cherry to do would be to provide backers with a fair discount on Silksong if/when it releases, or perhaps give them free copies entirely. I'm pretty sure they are self-publishing the game, so it should be within their power to make that happen. \n\nAnyway, this situation is a prime example of how game crowdfunding can be so messy. Milestones are an easy pitfall for developers to fall in to, and lots of people have the wrong expectations when it comes to pledging money to a campaign. It's not the same as pre-ordering an upcoming game or buying an unfinished game that's in early access. With crowdfunding, you are simply funding a developer so they can take their *concept* for a game and try to make it a reality. The problem is, concepts and ideas are in a constant state of flux during a game's development cycle, and this can lead to things like a game growing in scope or initial ideas and features being cut for technical or logistical reasons. That's why making promises for free DLC through milestones is a risky endeavor. People will naturally view that milestone as an immutable part of the base product's value, and if a developer changes course with that milestone or they end up unable to fulfill it then you get situations like this.",

            "So what? If it comes out and it's not as good as Hollow knight do we lose some kind cosmic test?\n\nPeople need to seriously chill out and play something else. If it comes out and it's great, that's fantastic. If it comes out and is bad, that's tough but not the end of the world.",
            "I get it. I'm not a huge fan, but I recognize that it's an excellent game, so I can understand the hype for the sequel. I just think people might have unrealistic expectations of a 3-man team. 6+ years is a long time, but from what they have said it seems like this game is 2-3 times the size of the original, so the length of development kind of tracks. I think the first game took like 3-4 years for them to make.\n\nThe biggest consideration is how much the speed of development will be affected when one of them gets sick, takes a vacation, or has some other event in their life that has to take precedent over work. Larger studios can deal with this much easier, but with only three people it's a totally different story. They may also just be practicing a much healthier work-life balance, especially if they are flush on cash from sales of the first game. I'd be doing the same thing lol.\n\nI can 100% agree that some more transparency on the game's progress would be good. I think a lot of people just want affirmation that the game is in fact *not* in development hell.",
            "> There are games made by single devs that managed to get released before Silksong. \n\nOk, but there are numerous factors at play which makes this kind of a moot point.\n\n* The most obvious: size and complexity of the game.\n\n* Studio size and developer skill/experience level:\n  * How big of a difference does having 3 people vs. 1 actually make?\n  * Developers with more skill and experience might get more done on a day to day basis compared to those with less skill and experience.\n\n* Work-life balance: \n  * What kind of schedule do they operate on? \n  * Do they deal with any chronic illnesses or conditions that require time off?\n  * Do they need time off in order to care for family/loved ones?\n  * Do they have to work a second job for additional financial support?\n  * Do they take annual/seasonal vacations?\n\n> At this point if the scope is too large for 3 folks to handle for 7 years, maybe it\u2019s a sign to dial things back.\n\nPerhaps. But we aren't in a position to decide whether or not Silksong is too large in scope for Team Cherry to handle. That's up for them to decide for themselves. Hopefully the game does come out and it's as good as or better than the first game and it will have been worth all the blood sweat and tears that they poured in to it. We can only decide for ourselves whether or not we care enough to keep waiting.\n\nMore importantly, they are not the first indie studio to bite off more than they can chew, and they will not be the last. Iconoclasts was a 1-man endeavor that took 8 years to make. Great game. Should that guy have dialed things back? I dunno, it might not have turned out as good. Crosscode was made by a dozen people and took a decade to make. *Incredible* game. Should they have dialed things back? Hard to say. But it was their first game ever and they completely knocked it out of the park, so perhaps 10 years was the amount of time they needed to make the game so good. The point being, this is kind of common with big indie projects. They take a long ass time to make, for better or worse.\n\nAnyway, I totally get why people are growing more concerned after all this time since the first game became such a wild success and people want to see more. But at the end of the day Hollow Knight was an ambitious project by a very small team, and that hasn't changed despite their success. Team Cherry didn't go the route of other indie studios and hire a bunch of people and expand. They chose to remain small and, apparently, have grown *more* ambitious. We can only wait and see if they succeed again.",

They use to say \"the next ban list will be no sooner than [date]\", and as soon as the date would hit people would spam every social media post with \"where ban list, where ban list, where ban list\". Now Konami just says \"it'll be in the next few months\" and is radio silent on the matter until then, which kinda makes things worse, since people still spam social media about when the list should drop, but now there's no cut-off date where you know it's quiet.",

Game studios talk about development all the time, including if their game will be delayed. It's factually not a lie. While I don't support people being absurd about this game, Team Cherry could communicate a single sentence if they wanted to. It's up to them, if they like going radio silent, that is their choice.",

Finish one game and don't have too much hope that what you were getting excited about at the end of the last game and its DLC will be the major focus of the next game - besides Corypheus but Corypheus sucks so that was a dissapointment. Or there's Origins and since it's first it get's to be the main game whereas the next 2 games are 2 spin offs. All three games are so different that it would not be narratively problematic for each to have a sequel.\n\nYou could do a DA:O 2, DA 2-2, DAI-2 and it'd probably be a good thing. Each could follow the gameplay of the predecessor. Each follow the story. Each follow the art style. The trailer and gameplay demonstration for DA the Veilguard also made me feel like that game being 10 years after Inquisition and how they setup those 3 characters at the last moment of the gameplay video, DA:tV can be the 4th seperate series of games in the Dragon Age game universe",

Like visually the game is genuinely terrible. It looked pretty poor when it came out, tbh. Art style: kinda bad. Texture work: bad. Models: bad.\n\nThat said IMO it holds up in general, but you do need to do some dicking around to get it working right. The main thing is that the game has a crashing bug you need a mod to fix (and it'll still crash every now and then, but it's borderline unplayable without the mod/patch). So long as you save regularly and in different slots, you'll be ok.",

            "I just played through them for the first time throughout the last year. Play them in order. Your actions in each game slightly affect things that happen in subsequent games, but you don't play the same main character in each game. Side characters can show up in multiple games though.\n\n\n\nOrigins \u2192 Dragon Age 2 \u2192 Dragon Age Inquisition\n\n  \nIn my opinion Origins is the best, as it feels more like a classic RPG but might not be for everyone because the controls are ancient. Combat can be tough early on, and at times feel unfair. You can get lost and it really is an \"explore everywhere and read your journal\" kind of game. About 20-30 hours.\n\nDragon Age 2 does a good job at making combat feel more streamlined and fun, but I found the combat overall to be pretty easy. It was fun to play and talk to people, but almost all your time is spent in one city and you don't really feel like you are exploring that much. You go outside the city at times but not far, except for one case. About 20 hours.\n\nInquisition was probably my least favorite. It boasts the longest playthrough for me, about 70 hours. The combat is similar to Dragon Age 2. It's strength is you really feel like you are exploring an entire world and meeting all sorts of different people. The issue is each region feels pretty much the same with the same style of quests with a new coat of paint on the environment. The story is fine, but with so much content, if you are exploring a lot you will over level and at times be a little confused as it may have been awhile since you interacted with the main story.",

If you play this I'd recommend not going into it right after finishing Origins, because Origins makes DA2 look like a bad joke.\n\nDAI is good. It's got a great story, characters and gameplay but it's buried behind a ton of tedious open world activities and grind. Kind of the same issue the modern Assassins Creed games have. That said it's still a solid game and 100% mandatory if you're planning on playing Veilguard.",
            "DA origins is the best story and it has more of a CRPG combat. The story and characters are really good, but the combat is a bit aged at this point. Will need some mods like 4gb patch to run well without crashes.\n\nDA2 is in a weird spot, the characters and the story are well written imo, and in some parts the story gets really heavy, but the game had only a bit over a year in the oven and it really show, there are loads of recycled areas and you visit them constantly. The combat is like faster paced Origins combat so more RTWP, but more flashy, and melee jumps to enemies for example. Fights also get a bit boring because basically every enemy encounter has enemies spawning in waves, its never just the guys you see, but theres basically a double of triple amount of them spawning after a while.\n\nDAI is probably my favourite personally, the combat is getting into a hybrid Action rpg territory at this point. Instead of clicking enemies you hold down a button to attack, and you have less skills to use at a time, but it FEELs more actiony. Skills move you around more for example. The open worlds in the game can get a bit boring cause theres a lot of busywork to do like collecting bottles, planting flags, collecting this and that, but honestly it's not necessary stuff. I liked the story from inquisition a lot, and the combat is easily best feeling for me. Inquisition also still looks really good graphically. I also really loved the companions and their stories here.\n\nIf you can, get them all, they all follow different characters mostly (except 2 and 3 share at least 1 major character) and play them in order. None of them are bad, even though all of them are flawed games.\n\nMy personal order is:  \nDAI (most modern, my favourite like you said it can get grindy, but the grind is honestly pretty useless)  \nDAO (one of the best RPGs, combat is showing its age)  \nDA2 (obviously rushed, but really good story and characters, combat and balancing can get wonky)\n\nBut i know that a lot of people will disagree with me on this one.",

The gameplay was made more action-y, the story isn't nearly as great (though still good), and it's blatantly obvious that BioWare didn't have nearly enough time to finish the game. That's most obvious with the game's dungeon as only a small number of dungeon maps exist that get reused over and over for different dungeons by just blocking off rooms and passages.\n\nAs for DA:Inquisistion, I can't help you. Haven't played it yet. Sorry.\n\nHowever, at the very worst you can play the first DA as a complete stand-alone experience and ignore the other games if you want.",

Its probably one of the only games i recall where decisions actually matter. This game has a lot going for it, from a pretty big got type of story - betrayal , nudity, gore, intrigue, and even comedy. It has a lot about the blight and what makes dragon age different than other rpgs.\n\nDa: 2 is real time button mashing combat with minor strategy. You can ram things, change character and ram the same enemy, requiring very little strategy for most things. Hawke is a boring ass character and the game revolves around templar vs sorcerers and the idea of what makes someone dangerous. I loved this game on my first pt, but on subsequent pt, i despised this.\n\nDa i imo is in the middle. Da:I takes place few years after da 2 and its about stopping a new blight lf sorts, but it has more characters involved and countries/ politicis simulator. My main problem with da i is that there is lot of fluff in this game and the good moments are severely hampered down.

It has so much potential to be better if they brought back the cut content, or even expanded on it.\n\nDa 2 is the only game where i think boobs and sex was more important than dragons. I recall the first mod for da 2 was nude mod, and i believe removing hawkes scar/ allowing customization. I found the combat fun just like you did, but realized how bad of a game it was after.",

If it was released as any other game besides a DA sequel, it would be a lot better received I think.",

I think the 3 games, while different, all contribute meaningfully to the Dragon Age universe and therefor are all worth playing, that simple. Origins felt pretty clunky to play by todays standards and so the more simple action oriented 2/3 was a nice change of pace and didn't bother me. At this point DAO is the outlier in the series and not the norm so people just hating on the other 3 games now because they keep expecting DAO style I find to be a bit ridiculous.

            "\"They all have strengths\" doesn't really say much. I could not be a fan and acknowledge that they have strengths. It really just depends on what those strengths are and how much value you put into them.  The gameplay for all three is different so it's completely possible to like one and dislike another. The stories run from extensive in 1, to almost comic book style in 2, to kindof a balance of both in 3. Personally I loved all the characters in one and two and can name them since release. I could only name two characters from three besides returning characters because I found them so forgettable.\n\nI think it's entirely possible to like DA: Origins and not the other two. While I enjoyed 2 I would've been just fine playing it for the story a year later on discount because it was a rushed product and isn't worth $60 to me personally. It's not a bad game but it needed more time to bake imo. 3 just had bland characters writing, uninspiring quest design, a generic open world design that was mimicking a console game approach that was starting to go stale and a villain who was a generic joke.\n\nMore importantly I got past the weaknesses and got through them but I have a friend who has never even completed 2 or played 3. She watched YouTube summaries on them that focused on the story and characters, read the book/comics whatever they were, owns the DVDs of the side stories, has about any dragon age merchandise in existence. I've played all three game. She hasn't. She doesn't like 2 and won't give 3 a chance and I don't blame her. They are huge departures from the spirit of the enormous amount of time, effort, love, and lore that established the spirit of dragon age. 2 and 3 leach off that spirit to get a passing grade. She's still by far a bigger fan than me of the world the original devs created.",

I tested hammers, some swords, but nothing seems as powerful as spamming Bloodhound Finesse. \n\nAt this point in the game I don't know how to find another weapon as good, but I also can't stand it anymore.\n\n\nEdit: thank you guys for the tips",

            "> I just couldn't be arsed to upgrade them all over again\n\nYeah the upgrading sucks. I still managed to play the game with 7 different weapons and 4 shields, but I wanted to play with even more but that would have cost so many runes. Late-game I just used cheats to upgrade all weapons to +24, which would still be possible with a lot of grind, and it was even more fun to play with a bunch of different items.  \n\nIf you don't want to use cheats or upgrade too many weapons, I recommend using like 2-5 weapons with different damage-type/weight/playstyle, upgrade only these, but use different Ashes of War and switch up the AoW-Affinity. This still changes their playstyle a bit and you can play around with all different elemental damage/effects. Don't forget that unlike Dark Souls you can always change the AoW Affinity without any cost!",
            "100% agreed, exactly the reason I got bored of my first playthrough. The game gives way too little in the way of upgrade materials and finding all the smithing stone bell-bearings during a blind first playthrough is either unlikely or would take ages, during which you may grow bored of your current weapon. \n\nAll my subsequent playthroughs since I've blatantly cheated for upgrade materials only and I always end up using like 50 different weapons over the course of an entire playthrough.",
            "This is why the whole idea of \"so many builds to try\" is ultimately pretty boring in Elden Ring. There's a great number of weapons to try, but not even anywhere near enough upgrade materials for them.",
            "I'd recommend looking up a couple videos for OP builds.  They tend to be pretty fun.\n\nComet Azur build is OP and I enjoy watching the light show.\n\nAnt rapier + another status effect weapon gets really stupid.  Constant bleed/frost/poison stacking gets ridiculous.",
            "You beat the game in 40 hours or you only played for 40 hours and got bored?",
            "Makes me sad I never got to play pre nerf versions. I don't usually have fomo, except for old content you can't ever go back to.",
            "I'm 170 with a maxed Mogh spear and I just tickle that fire dude at the start of the dlc. Normal mobs die easy so far though.",
            "I wouldn't put too much stock into that  without playing around yourself.  The weapons I have hundreds hours of muscle memory with will outperform new stuff till I get used to it.",
            "That doesn't really mean anything. There are A LOT of new weapons. I highly doubt the reviewer tried them all. Not all weapons are created equal. He probably just tried some dlc weapons that weren't that great, or even didn't fit the playstyle.",
            "A lot of the new weapons have cool looking stuff, which might be great against normal enemies, but probably isn't the best damage against bosses.",
            "Wait until the extreme data-driven youtubers get a hold of the regulation bins. We'll find out exactly how strong the new weapons are lol",
            "That'd have been pre-patch though no? A lot of weapons are getting nerfs now.",
            "Game journalists though lol. Like the WaPo lvl 713 guy spending 4 days on the DLC hard boss",
            "You shouldn't trust anything that IGN says.  \nThey're about as untrustworthy as they come.",
            "They probably want to avoid another Rivers of Blood/Ringed Knight Paired Greatswords situation. Those two weapons ruined their respective PVP scene when they were released/fixed.",
            "Sure it is unless you really wanted to be pidgeonholed into using a select few dlc weapons.",
            "Same but elenoras poleblade. I\u2019m gonna dance and make everything bleed. I hope there\u2019s some good new bleed weapons to try out though",
            "The blood enchanted uchigatana and/or Nagakiba are way better than rivers of blood and it isn\u2019t even close. Give it a try!",
            "After a year long break I\u2019m too rusty/scared to try anything else. Like a true coward, rivers it is! Although I did see a disgusting video with Eleanora\u2019s poleblade build absolutely wrecking.",

            "Isn't wings of astel the mace/flail weapon you get from fighting that weird ass eldritch space baby beast??",
            "I wish they'd buff the carian knight sword. I put the carian grandeur ash of war on a maxed regular longsword with magic and get more damage due to the better int scaling. If they made the carian knight sword maybe charge grandeur faster or scale purely with int and strength, I think it'd be amazing",
            "Dual curved swords. Lightning infusion (comes from a later-area whetblade). Talismans/buffs that improve rapid attack damage. Highest DPS I've seen without status effects",
            "Guardian Swordspear is good early game (though you might have to farm). Once you get to Leyndell grab Bolt of Gransaxx, IMO the best part of dex builds and up there with the other top tier weapons since you can be hyper mobile around boss arenas and sniper for huge damage",
            "I will note Uchi is a top tier dex weapon. I just beat the entire game with it and the other katanas are side-grades.",
            "The man himself!",
            "omg it's him",
            "Why does it have to be as good? It's a game, play to have fun. If the play style isn't enjoyable just don't play it. I beat the entire game with spear and shield and I'm dogshit at parrying I just enjoy the Spartan aesthetic. The game cares way more about your upgrade level and personal skill than it does what weapon you're using.",
            "I dunno, I just beat the entire game with an uchigatana without using summons and it never felt weak. \n\nThe weapons generally feel pretty balanced.",
            "As good as Bloodhounds Fang? Not too many. Nightrider's Glaive, Uchigatana, Moonveil, Moonlight Greatsword, Ruin's Greatsword, Blasphemous Blade, Godslayer's Greatsword are all around the same level, but aren't as easy to obtain.\n\nBut Elden Ring can be beaten with every weapon. With the right build, and the right weapon upgrades, almost all of them (barring bows) can be good (seriously don't use bows)",
            "This is admittedly kinda a shit answer because it's not exactly what you're asking for. But if you learn to parry literally anything feels good. You get this dopamine inducing sound effect followed by you stabbing whatever you're holding into an enemy for a million damage. \n\nTo actually answer your question: \"Greatsword\" is really easy to get and has a ridiculous attack rating with Heavy infusion. It gets even more ridiculous as you hit the STR softcap, then start putting points into DEX and then infuse it to Quality. It's not even slow because you can spam the crouch-light-attack for a quick, extremely long ranged stab that also has the benefit of knocking over most humanoid enemies.",
            "In terms of hitting like a truck, being available almost from the start of the game, having a good weapon art and (for some reason) still letting you use greases? It has no equal. \n\nDoesn't really matter though. Lots of other strong weapons that are fun to use as well.",
            "Don't compare every weapon to Bloodhound's Fang L2 spam then. Test out movesets and if some of them look good to you then just go with that weapon. For me it's the great axe moveset that I can't get enough of ever since Dark Souls 3. Upgrade material scarcity sucks hard in ER though, so choose carefully. \n\nEvery weapon is viable, although depending on the boss, some of the slower weapons are trickier to use unless you opt for the dreary jump attack spam until poise break, rinse and repeat playstyle. Daggers and fist weapons can also be troublesome to hit certain bosses with. \n\nBut bleed is generally super powerful in Elden Ring so if all you care about is maximum damage as easily as possible then L2 spam is the way to go I suppose. Bleed does percentage based damage and works on most enemies in the game so that's why it's so powerful.",
            "Try not leaning so hard on just spamming L2 ? BHF is the busted weapon Fromsoft tries to give you at the start of the game so everyone has an option from the getgo\n\nThere's 100+ ashes of war in the game man, surely some combo will illicit some joy and fun gameplay. I've recently been falling in love with the dragon halberd, super sick L2 that adds a ton of flat damage and cold build up while looking sick as hell doing it.\n\nAs strong as BHF? nah but I love halberd moveset / range and it gets the dopamine going",

            "Yeah lightning shreds. It's not basically omnipotent like fire with its special interactions, but it has the highest AR I've seen on fast weapons. I can get like 700 AR on one of the fastest weapons in the game lmao (soul level 93 lvl 21 weapons).New dlc might be the ye olde souls dlc \"magic and elemental damage get out\", so take that with a grain of salt.",
            "I\u2019d argue Blasphemous Blade makes a way easier play through than Bloohound. Spec\u2019ing in faith and spamming the L2 is outrageous, plus kills with it restore health.

I switched from BF to it and it\u2019s been a pleasant addition, especially since faith is more interesting to play with due to all the incantations, either offensive or defensive.",

The new weapons will probably be balanced the same way.\n\nThen the only thing that makes them better/worse is special ashe of war or if they have some special animation like zwiehander.",
            "In Souls games, you find what you like and stick with it. Early game weapons are generally just as viable as end-game boss weapons. For example, the starting longsword in DS3 never stops being top tier.\n\nThe new weapons are exciting because they open up new playstyles, not because they have higher numbers. They aren't outclassed, just different.",
            "not outclassed. equal. point is different movesets, ashes of war, reach etc.",
            "Raw damage isn't the only value to a weapon. attack speed, stance damage, recovery frames, scaling, range, etc. all play a factor. Like, I'd love to see a weapon better than the spiked balls, but I don't know if that's really gonna be doable lol",
            "If you had a freezer full of steak, would you never eat anything else?",
            "I too used to rely on rivers of blood, then I learned the enchanted Nagakiba is essentially the same thing but better in every way. Better reach, better damage, higher bleed buildup (by a lot).",

            "I soloed Malenia that way",

            "Not really, not sure why would one do that",
            "If you can find a way to revert to an old version of the game. It\u2019s absolutely worth it.",
            "It's like Bloodborne. The DLC had some of my favourite weapons, but my trusty saw cleaver was still just as good.",
            "Good analogy",
            "I'm not sure what your point is, but I'd just eat steak tbh.",

            "I can! I'll give it a try.",
            "The saw cleaver is such a beaut, just the most well rounded weapon in any game.  With that said, some BB DLC weaps were broken good.  I'm looking at you Rakuyo, Pizza Cutter and Bloodletter.",
            "Yes sadly even though they\u2019re enchanted they still look like regular Katanas.",
            "With that logic why not exclusively play at level 1 using your fists on every boss? Then the fight lasts longer and is more challenging",
            "Because it sucks playing with no health or endurance. If you don\u2019t like it so be it. Also there are cool weapons with cool move sets, nothing to do with fists and nothing to do with being level 1.\n\nI\u2019m saying there\u2019s a subset of players that don\u2019t get much joy in one shotting enemies or being one shot."

            "they were challenging and I remember that getting all the platinum on crash 3 back then was pretty difficult, but in crash 4 some crates and secret paths are really really hard to spot and to get the platinum relics you are forced to do the new slide spin move non stop for the whole level which can be painful",
            "I mean this game came out in 2017, so in terms of sales over time it has sold significantly worse than Elden Ring. Is it so implausible that a 7 year old compilation of three beloved games would sell this much? People love remakes of classics, there's a huge market for them.",
