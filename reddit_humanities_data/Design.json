When people ask me what I do on or study, I tell them ui ux design. 99% of times, they make a confused face. The basic approach I try is, \"Uncle, the apps and websites you use, I design themre to put pictures, text\" all that, that is my usual approach. Sometimes I get lucky and the person on other end is developer, most time that doesn't happen. How do you people approach this problem?",

            "The only masters level I have encountered has been an MFA (Master of Fine Arts), who was basically a very talented artist who also was technically self-taught as a graphic designer ( because they wanted an actual job in addition to their fine arts work at that time) The Masters essentially was an extension of their degree. I don't know that it impacted their job prospects at all - their portfolio was very diverse and excellent, which was really all that mattered. The fact that they had an MFA was merely interesting.\n\nThat said - I have kept in touch with this person over the years. They seem to be doing quite well now in the fine arts community & I don't think needs to really work as a graphic designer anymore; I think they do it purely because they love it. Others who only have their degrees (like myself) are still working as designers. I don't know that an MFA would change that.\n\n... Highly subjective I think.",

Job opportunities are better too. \nBesides, it also helps since I consider teaching down the line..",

I apologise for the lengthy post. \nI appreciate all the answers provided.\nThank you for your time and effort.\n\n\n1.\nWho decides what images are used in a website\u2019s layout design, the client or  the designer ? \nHypothetically  I have to design a website for an Italian restaurant,\ndo I have to give very specific instructions to the client about each image that he needs to send me.\nFor example instruct the client to send me an image for the hero header section of the website, which should be 1280px by 720px and has to display a pizza which is on the right hand side of a  brown wooden table with some tomatoes scattered  around it and some white flour sprinkled around it, makes sure there is nothing on the left side \nbecause this is where the title and sub title will be located.\nThen repeat this process for all of the other images required for the website?\n\nOr do I use any image the client provides me for the hero image, and also for  the rest of the images?\n\nOr do we decide what the images look like and their composition  together with the client?\n\nDo I make this decision entirely on my own, choosing all of the imagery from stock photography?\n\nDoes the client hire a photographer who shoots the images?\nIn this case do I just use the images sent to me by the photographer, or do I have to work together with the photographer instructing the photographer what I need, \ngiving him specific instructions about what each images should look like and display?\n\n\n2.\nWho decides what is the written text or the body copy in the website, the text which is in the titles, sub-titles, paragraphs, and in the call to action buttons?\n\nDoes the client decide what all of the written text will be?\n\nDoes the client have to hire a copywriter who will create all of this?\n\nDo I the designer have to create all of this?\n\n\n3.\nAt which stage of the website design process  we have to have all of the content (text and imagery) ready from the client?\n\nAt school we learned that content has to be ready before we start making the website\u2019s UI design, because we will use the text and imagery sent by the client at this stage. These final designs will be 100% accurate and represent  how the developed \nwebsite will look in the browser once online.\nWe learned that  before doing all of this, first we have to do some low-fidelity sketches with pen and paper, these show the structure, layout of each web page, and all of the page elements.\nNext based on the sketches we made, we make wireframes using software like UX Pin or Balsamiq.\nThese wireframes are very basic, \nmonochrome  in colour, they use dummy text and the images are represented \nby a rectangle with a cross through it. We learned that once the client approves these wireframes and we received all the content from them, we start the final UI design, in school we used Adobe XD for this process. \n\nMy question regarding this is, should we have all of the content ready from our client before we start the sketching process ?\n\nI am confused about this because I researched on the internet and so far found information that states you should have all \ncontent ready at the very beginning, even before you start making the website layout sketches. \nBut I remember the teacher telling us in school,  that once the wireframes created with UX Pin or Balsamiq are approved by the client, we then send the client a list of content needed based on those wireframes, and once we receive all of the content we use that to make the final UI designs with Adobe XD.\n\nBased on what do you decide the type and amount of content (text and imagery) needed to be gathered from the client?\n",

            "The imagery really depends on the client, if they're an established business with a brand and a bank of images they will most likely send you those images and you pick the appropriate ones to use in the appropriate places. But often it's a collaborative process where you give guidance to the client, if they are doing a photoshoot for the site you might collaborate with the photographer too. There isn't one standard process because all businesses are different.\n\n\n\u00a0Same with the copy, I would usually ask for an outline of what sections they want and what kind of message they want to get across but often for smaller businesses you would be expected to write it in a tone that suits their brand.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0One thing about freelance web design is that most businesses can't afford to employ a developer, a designer, a copywriter and a marketer so they want you to cover it all, including SEO from my experience.\n\n\nThe expectation is that you can not only build a wordpress website but can design a website and flows that will increase sales/bookings etc. if I'm running a small restaurant I might have zero experience in writing for the web or knowing how to choose good quality images so you need to know how to do that for me. This doesn't have to be done ahead of time of building out the final site, no one is expecting final copy or images in the first draft.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnd finally I wouldn't cling too tightly to what your teachers tell you, they are often far removed from freelance experience. Just seen how it goes on your first project and offer those services if needed.",
            "every client is different and almost none of them behave like assignments sadly. one of the great tragedies of leaving school \ud83d\ude14 \n\nyou should have a kickoff meeting where you ask all this. \u201cdo you have content already? do you have an outline? do you have photos? do you want/can you hire a photographer? a copywriter?\u201d etc etc (if you don\u2019t feel comfortable with any part of the process don\u2019t offer it or hire out. i hire a developer for most sites and i wouldn\u2019t do writing myself ever.) do this BEFORE sending a proposal so you can build in time like searching for stock photos, etc into your fee\n\ni almost never get final final content at the start but often the client has nearly-done content or an outline of each page so you have a structure from them. half the time i\u2019m putting final content into the dev site two days before launch lol \n\nyou may have to design around things. if they have photos and only want to use them and can\u2019t afford a photographer you can\u2019t invent a picture with space on the left; you might have to extend it in photoshop yourself or figure out a design solution that covers the left. etc \n\ni don\u2019t do much UI but i think the principle is the same. you can also dictate some of this too! it\u2019s your choice to say \u201ci will absolutely not begin until i have final content.\u201d but you\u2019ll have to judge how that\u2019ll go over or if it\u2019s a hill worth dying on. \n\nall of this just comes with experience. don\u2019t let any of this discourage you either. each project being different can be part of the fun \ud83d\ude0a",

Is the issue the luminance hierarchy?\n\nAnd then drill down, find what the issue is - then:\n\nis their concern valid?\n\nIf no - explain to them why your current design works to address their concern and why changing it would for example break the visual heirarchy etc.\n\nIf yes - either accept their suggestion would work, or suggest an alternative way to address the problem.\n\nAnyway, just suck it up - they are paying, it is annoying as heck, they should warn kids before they chose this career that it's going to be like this.",
            ">some people seem to get really offended when you ask them why they want that change to try to help them find another solution.\n\nMost non-designers don't know how to articulate design feedback. Maybe their offended reaction is actually defensiveness because you asked them a question they truly don't know how to answer?\n\nI like to guide the person from their prescriptive feedback into something more constructive. \n\n>Client: \"Please make that text red.\"  \n  \nDesigner: \"We could do that, maybe...but could you please help me understand the reason? Do you feel like this text deserves higher priority? Do you want it to feel like a warning or an error message? Do you just want more of your brand colors to appear throughout?\"\n\nAfter we uncover the **actual** issue, I then briefly talk them through potential ways it could be addressed. I might also explain why changing the text color might not be the right solution to that particular problem. \n\n>Client: \"Yeah, it needs to be higher priority. That text is the most important thing on the page, and right now it's getting lost.\"  \n  \nDesigner: \"That makes a ton of sense. Ok, this text should be the number one priority. If we make it red, it's going to be shouting louder which **would** make it more noticeable but would also throw off the balance of the whole design. Maybe we should promote that message to the headline and create some space around it, so it's the first thing the viewer sees. Are there any other competing elements we could remove?\" etc etc\n\nThe goal is to make them feel heard, understood, and supported.

            "Best advice I ever got was from a Hollywood screenwriter who deals with some of the biggest idiot clients on earth.\n\nLook at where they're drawing your attention. It's usually some weakness in the work. Most people can see this better than you can and if you swallow your ego for a second you'll usually agree it can use some work. Have another pair of eyes that points where you half assed something is a gift.\n\nIgnore their solutions. Their ideas are usually complete dogshit and they spent all of 30 seconds thinking about them. Find your own solution. If it's a good solution it's unlikely to be mentioned again",
            "In my experience, you can basically take one of two directions. In a corporate environment and when you're dealing with Poject Managers and Sales People, I've found that the path of least resistance is just to do whatever dumb thing they're asking for. You're still going to get paid every two weeks and finesse and art isn't appreciated by those people in the same way it is to us. LIke, whatever, if you want it to be hideous and we're going to lose 2% on clickthroughs, whatever, it's your project, please send me an email so when your boss asks me why that ad sucked so bad I can show it to them and show that said Project Manager disregarded by two decades of experience and wanted it their way.\n\nWith freelance, it's a little different in that, you came to me as a client and you therefore trust my decision making process. So when I tell you that the change that you're asking for is a bad idea, I'm hoping you listen and trust me. At the end of the day though, they're still paying and whatever they think they actually want, they're going to get. It would be like if I had a fully organic garden in my back yard but in my shed I'm making cyanide, if the client demands cyanide, that's what they're going to get.\n\nAnd with both of these things, I never sign my designs. I sign all of my paintings because they're for me and if I show them to other people I want people to know who did it. Ad work, design work? I'd rather be anonymous.\n\nYou can try over and over and over to try to educate people but you'll learn that most people don't want to be educated. They think they already know what anything and everything should look like and they also tend to believe that the work itself is easy. Like, okay, you go learn how to use Photoshop and Illustrator and how to write even front end code. I wonder how long that will take.\n\nBest of luck to you. Keep your chin up, try to not get overly emotionally invested in the work and go make that money.\n\n(Sorry for the rant)",

So you can sit there and talk with them and lead them into a alternative but effective design you can both come to agree on.

Are there other stakeholders involved? Is the feedback aligned with the overall goals that you discussed at the start of the project?\n\nIf a person's paying you to complete the work on contact, you can always just give them exactly what they want, but also create your own version, and pitch both.  At the end of the day, you can still put your version in your portfolio because it represents your skill and your decisions. \n\nIf it's a salary position, there are probably others on the team that are involved.

            "That\u2019s the industry, unfortunately. We deal with objectivity, emotion and interpretation when working on creative, unlike say, a plumber who deals in facts. People will often trust their own intuition above yours because they are processing it through their own filters and without the context of your experience. In other words, people don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know. The thing I\u2019ve learned over the years is that my role is to provide guidance as much as anything else, it\u2019s a people job as much as it is a design job. It\u2019s often your responsibility to teach your client how to be a good client because that\u2019s a learned thing. \n\nPersonally, when I\u2019m working with a client I like to explain my reasoning as I go so that they understand why I made the choices I made. This will set up a framework which allows me to ask for their reasoning when they ask for a change, which will usually make them think about why they want to make the change. \"I can make that change, but can you tell me what problem you\u2019re trying to sold by doing that? I\u2019m just trying to get an understanding of your reasoning.\u201d Sometimes I\u2019ll explain that personal taste has to take a back seat to effective communication and then point out the issues that would be created by making the change. Other times I won\u2019t make the change that they ask but I\u2019ll do something different to address their concerns while keeping it on brand. I find involving them in the process can lead to better results too, listen to their concerns and be collaborative in finding solutions. Soft skills are almost as important as design skills in this industry, so it might be worth looking into developing that side of your game.

Even if I think they are mistaken it is valuable to know how others perceive your design and better yet, to understand why they ended up with that understanding.\n\nIf I have to complain about anything, it is that colleagues don't provide nearly enough input.  Back in art college we had the culture that fostered a ton of that.  I miss that.

Very few people will have the context for the work that you do, and often the solution they propose to fix the thing they don't like will break or effect something else.\n\nIn some rare cases, a colleague knows how to solve the problem because they have already solved it in their own work. Take what they offer with a grain of salt, and decide if it makes sense.\n\nWhen dealing with clients, I like to ask what does or does not work well for them. I certainly don't invite \"fixes\".

I can't even really explain why, but I guess it's probably them hoping a really good design is in all of the posted ones somewhere, just that we are supposed to figure it out for OP.",

Lots of advices from recruiters for job seekers also suggest to keep it short but efficient for them to scan\n\nHowever, when I look up popular agency portfolios, they tend to be very descriptive and explain every decision on concept, logo, colors, typography, supporting assets which I personally get more inspired from this format. Also, if I have a passion to work for agency (which I found it extremely hard to be noticed), this format works better since I can elevate my creative thought more. \n\nIn summary, what is everyone take on this issue? Which approach would you personally advise for job seekers? ",

            "Select your work you like the most. Needs to be something that you are proud off. I would rather go for someone that have less work but well explain then a lot of work showed in a random way. Show the employers why they should hire you. Show them you love it. I prefer looking for a work that meant something for the person that create it, and if you need to use words to describe the process or what you were looking, use it. Just make sure the page, video, etc is atractive.\u00a0 If you use pdf look for magazines or arhitecture books to see how they display image/ text. With 3 pages you are set to go. A good presentation letter\u00a0 and an cv.\u00a0"
