When the subreddit started the rule \"Content must be about cats\" made sense, but we do not need to expressly codify this anymore. We're not a small community these days and it has not happened in years that someone posted a bunny rabbit instead of a cat. We will of course still remove off-topic content but do not see the need to clutter up the rules page with something that our community understands to be self-evident. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe will likely make minor edits and additions to this new rule-set in the coming weeks until everything is just the way we like it, but the rules as posted now are the general framework from which we will do so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have kept our rules broadly worded so they can encompass many topics and so we do not need to codify for every single possibility. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most important rules are at the top. Our number one rule is to respect each other. This for example includes following rediquette and sitewide rules, but also our subreddit-specific rule of not attacking other posters for not raising their pets to your satisfaction. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur rule about spam, memes and self-promotion includes  accounts that do not directly promote their content, but which nevertheless primarily exist to drive content to their NSFW stores like Onlyfans. Everyone is welcome to post here, but NSFW sellers can do so on a seperate, SFW account. We do not allow memes as they are most often posted as easy karma-grabs instead of genuine engagement. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd so on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our new ruleset via the link at the top of this thread and give your feedback in a comment below. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for helping us make this space the wonderful community that it is and we hope you enjoy your time here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe r/cats mod team",

My parents used to put food out for the birds and the cats would come to try to eat the food, so my dad would run out and scare them off. They would all run apart from one, this little tabby girl. My dad couldn't go anywhere in the garden without her trailing around him. She would sneak into the house umtil they heard happy purring and clock that she was there. If you so much as gestured near your lap while sitting she would hop up for cuddles. They had told the lady before that the cat would try and enter the house sometimes, but she never asked after her or check in even when the cat wouldn't show for feeding times.\nSo the lady next door was moving house and came by saying 'oh i think I'm missing one of the cats, have you seen her?', to which my father just replied no.\nShe was happily asleep in the house in her favourite spot again.

Because I already owned 3 cats, one for each of my sons.\n\nWell this new cat, who boldly walked right into my house was NOT my cat!  He hopped on my sofa and immediately fell asleep.  When he woke up, I shooed him back out the front door, because he was a GORGEOUS cat and I was sure he was someone's beloved pet.\n\nWent to get the mail at 1pm when the kids were napping and he literally fell into the house!  He was sleeping against the door.\n\nClearly, he was not leaving.  We were his new people. He lived with me to the ripe old age of 18.

He was the sweetest cat in the world, and not a mean bone in his body.  He loved everyone and all of our other pets.  But he was a cross-eyed idiot.  He could get lost within 20 feet of our house.  A real doofus.  But adorable and incredibly sweet.  Back when we had him, Intel had ads on TV advertising how their processors could perform millions of calculations per second.  The joke when watching Spud pondering something was the phrase \"tens of calculations per second\".\n\nCheese reminds me of our late, great Lucy.  She was a pistol, and also sweet, but very smart.  She used to knock things off of counters or swipe at anything that made a noise and caused us to get up to stop her.  But once we figured out that she just wanted to get attention with all of that behavior, and stopped responding to it, she immediately stopped doing those things.  And she was super nosey.  She had to be in the middle of anything that was happening.  No fear of strangers whatsoever.  She'd be right there with the cable guy or whoever, inspecting every bit of whatever was being done.  She \"helped\" with all plumbing, electrical, cleaning, moving, or other tasks happening in the house.\n\nBut Biscuits.  Now she reminds me of our late great Isabelle (aka \"It's A Belly\").  Now she was trouble.  A super kitty, but a serious troublemaker.  She loved us people, and loved food.  But she could do some damage, and was also sort of mean to some of our other kitties.  And she was big.  A rather formidable beast.\n\nI miss all of those old kitties of ours.  Good memories!",

Just like humans, cats - and dogs, as well - can suffer from lead poisoning, and for smaller animals, it doesn't take much to be dangerous. \n\nOf course, non-lead paint still isn't great for them, but they won't be at risk for lead poisoning. If you or anyone you know has concerns about something possibly having lead paint, you can have the paint tested for lead by professionals, or you can buy a DIY kit and do it yourself.

And the bunny kicking (from my cat age 4 yrs) is from their litter play.\n\nAt only 8 weeks old I am no expert but I would say to create a corner / place where these 4 kittens spend most of their time together and play it out.  (Since kittens aren\u2019t generally ready to go time until 13 weeks)\n\nAlso look for cat toys called \u2018Kick Bags\u2019 or Kickers for them to play around house and walk away if they want to use human arms.

            "It\u2019s not about when it stops, it\u2019s about the corrective measures you take to mitigate the behavior. Kittens are playful little balls of energy. They think your hand is a toy. As other comments have mentioned, it\u2019s important to remove your hand immediately once the biting/kicking begins. Some say to withdraw all attention and don\u2019t return for a while. I recommend providing a toy mouse immediately after you remove your hand. I kept toy mice in my pocket for this very reason and it worked to train my kittens out of biting this way.\n\nMy childhood cats were all bitey little bastards because I constantly played with them with my hands without knowing any better. You reinforce the bitey behavior when you do this.",

It's not even really that difficult to train them otherwise, you just have to remove your hand for a while whenever they bite, and keep petting/rubbing them as a reward for when they're just acting normally.\n\nYou have to draw the line of what you consider tolerable behavior. I've always let my cats hold my arm and lick me, because it's harmless(and cute) grooming behavior, which is a sign of affection. But if you don't like the idea of them continuing this as they age, then act accordingly.",
            "You train them not to bite and scratch you. Start right now. If they bite or scratch, you perform being hurt. Think of the worst overacting you've ever seen. You yelp loudly - not angrily, don't shout at them, just \"Oooowwww!\" - and take your hand away, and walk away. No interaction. \n\nAfter a few minutes, if they try to interact with you, pet them to let them know that you're still buddies, but every time they bite or scratch, repeat. \n\nThat's how they learn to play with each other without causing actual injuries. \n\nNever let them play with your hands. Toys are for playing with. Hands are for petting and giving scritches.",

            "Usually when you pull your hand away.\n\nSome cats will learn to stop or to better control themselves (like keeping their claws retracted and going from biting to just licking) if you consistently withdraw your hand as soon as they start.  Others won't, no matter how old they get.  Either way, it's normal cat behavior.  Try to resist the fluffy belly, especially if they show signs of disliking that kind of touch.\n\nThat said, one of my 3 year old cats will sometimes get in a playful mood and start trying to latch onto my arm or leg (whatever's closest) to grab and bite me, even when I'm not touching him at all.  I always withdraw, but in all this time he still hasn't outgrown it.  Just pray that avoiding the danger zone is enough and that yours don't bring it to you...",

Finding her in the dark, with two blithering idiots who cannot see without our glasses and purposely made our room darker than some Goth's souls.

I always just cool their paws with a wet paper towel or cloth when they're sick, or bathe them if they have a fever (careful, there's methods for bathing cats to avoid being scratched or bitten).

Hardest things I've ever had to do. \n\nI still cry myself to sleep every night and wake up every morning crying.  I just have to remind myself that he had a bad heart murmur tho, so he wouldn't have been able to be sedated for surgery, and the ultrasound showed some other reasons surgery wouldn't help also any it helps relieve the guilt.\n\nSorry for trauma dumping on you, I'm still mourning. \n\nIf it's nothing serious but it keeps happening, ask your vet about the medication Cerenia.",

How do you feed her and her sister? Is there feeding times or is there a bowl with cat food left for them to eat at their leisure? What about her water intake? Does she drink water very fast? If she eats or drinks very fast, then this can cause puking. If she feels like her sister will get her food if she doesn\u2019t eat it all of it immediately, that\u2019s another reason she might be puking. \n\nAlso, just thought of this. If there is any flea issue, it could be a flea allergy. I thought this was the problem with my cat, and I do think she has an extreme flea allergy.

I\u2019m hoping she just ate an insect or spider or something that didn\u2019t agree with her.

            "I think my cat is defective. He will just vomit on whatever he is laying on at the time. I\u2019ve found vomit on my pillow, on the back of the couch, inside of my shoe (imagine my surprise while leaving home for work), and other random places. I wish he came with a warning system like that.",
            "Very true. My cats have a very distinct pre-vomit meow and it always alarms me because it sounds like they\u2019re being murdered. I assume that they are probably just super uncomfy before puking up a giant hairball. But they need to get those hairballs out!",
            "Yea it's a deeper sound. Yowling? Is that a real term?",
            "We know that sound and it\u2019s an instant rush before the *HURK HURK HURK* to make sure that he\u2019s on an easy clean surface \ud83d\ude02",
            "I was catsitting for a friend, and having never owned a cat myself, I was very alarmed when he made that exact sound while running through the house. It sounded like he was possessed! I was relieved when it turned out just to be nothing more than an announcement that he wanted to vomit!!",
            "My good lad the other day leapt up, looked at me and bolted off the couch. Almost made it to the hard wood instead of carpet. Like he knew it shouldn't at least be on carpet or the couch.",

            "My 14yo boy cat was doing this for the past 2 years.   He'd projectile vomit, with lots and lots of liquid and was losing weight from the vomiting.  Still eating/drinking/pooping but we were getting concerned.  Took him to a few different vets with them stating it might be lymphoma and we did blood work and an ultrasound, finding no masses.  I moved and saw a new vet and my cat was diagnosed with IBD.   Apparently it's very common in older cats (about 10-20%)and he was prescribed steroids.   Ever since then he's been great.   Vomiting has decreased drastically as well as less constipation too.   He's regaining weight and has much more energy.   I'd look into IBD for your cat and see if steroids work.",
            "Sigh my old guy is *exactly* the same way. Even his previous owner said he did it all the time. He eats food and drinks water and then pukes it all up and then goes back to eat a bit more. Just today he's been puking much more than normal and it's all clear liquid, maybe water, I am very concerned about it but he seems to suddenly be okay and scratching away at his little scratching post...",
            "I took my 17 year old baby to the vet again last week for the same reason, projectile vomiting, twice a day. The vet thought originally thought he was eating too fast so I started feeding him smaller amounts throughout the day, but then he started eating less. I took him to the vet to ask them to do X-rays to look for an obstruction and they found a GIANT tumor in his abdomen that was crushing his stomach and forcing everything back up. \n\nNot saying this is the case here, but now I worry about my other cats and whether or not the vet and I aren't looking deep enough with any of their problems. I beat myself up daily thinking if we had caught it when it was smaller, he might have survived but unfortunately due to his age and his heart murmur, the vet and I knew it was extremely unlikely for him to make it through surgery anyways and I just have to keep reminding myself that.",
            "lol That\u2019s so funny! Her sister meows really really loud when she is coming to bed at night. It\u2019s a big announcement and she wakes me up every night because I have to acknowledge her otherwise she won\u2019t  stop. It\u2019s so cute I forgive her \ud83d\ude00",
            "lol! Thank god she didn\u2019t gaslight you by making you believe that it was you who vomited and she is tired of cleaning up after you and then threatened you for giving you up for adoption",
            "Yup! It sounds like OP is watching carefully, and it\u2019s always good to notice any changes in behavior. One of my cats vomits every now and then, but I had to cancel a trip recently due to a change in his behavior, more than just the occasional vomiting. Basically had the kitty equivalent of food poisoning, but he\u2019s doing better now.",

            "Lol Thank God I don\u2019t have a carpet. She actually vomited in the garden this time, after consuming a portion of grass. But I am concerned as to why she would eat so much grass",
            "I do too. Thought I was the only one \ud83d\ude2d. I loathe throwing up.\nOn topic: Princess Mimi who is a female orange tabby also meows loudly before she has to throw up, if she is in the master bedroom and I am home , the warning meow gives me time to grab her and get her to the kitchen where it's easier to clean up. She also meows after pooping.",

            "He said he wasn\u2019t concerned enough to run blood tests.

But now the guests are gone, she doesn\u2019t shed as much and I have found a way to make her take the medicine",

            "I thought about it. Not that I know of. She has been going out in the garden since I had her, when she was 8 weeks old and she has never vomited before. Unless now that\u2019s its spring? I planted some flowers but I checked that they are safe for cats. And I have only seen her eating grass. How would I know?",
            "There is nothing I hate more than vomiting. Next time I want to vomit I will cry for my cat",
            "Thanks. I brush her every day as she has very thick hair. She was shedding insanely a lot lately and wasn\u2019t eating her hairball medicine. The vet told me that cats shed more when they are stressed. I realised that I had guests for a couple of weeks and she was shedding a lot more then, as she doesn\u2019t like people sleeping in the living room as she has claimed it as her own room and she was forced to sleep in my bed (even though she didn\u2019t have to) and I think it made her feel stressed.",
            "I hope your cat is well now! I can imagine how stressful it must be. I am sick with worry about mine every time she vomits",
            "It was so cute indeed because unlike her sister she never mewes, but the sight was not cute at all",
            "Thank you for the advice",

She was very smart and started positioning herself on the linoleum after the first two times I moved her.",

(I use a bucket when *I'm* ill...)\n\nThereafter, I kept some sturdy hefty type paper plates there on purpose. We were both quite happy about the arrangement. I didn't have to clean the bed and/ or the floor, etc. \n\nOriginally, he used to feel compelled to leave right after, to \"get away from it!\" But, as I was always whisking it away, he learned to relax and settle back down, after. That is, until he did it in the middle of the night when I was sound asleep. Between not being very alert, the dark, and no glasses, I didn't produce a plate in time. He was *SO* offended that I didn't immediately whisk it away. And worse, I then proceeded to steal *his* sheets, on *his* bed! STOMP! FLOUNCE! FLOUNCE! EXIT!

If I go away for the weekend he will not eat while I'm gone. If he doesn't come down into my office during the day while I'm working, he will not eat. He will sit on my pillow and refuse to do anything other than get water when he needs to and go to the bathroom. But he will intentionally starve himself. \n\nWhen I have to put him in a carrier to go anywhere, he will vomit and have explosive diarrhea everywhere because he works himself up so much. Which is why my vet and I decided to evaluate his individual behavior to determine if it was worth stressing him out so much to take him in. Sometimes I do give him a little bit of pumpkin for constipation as recommended by the vet. And occasionally some coconut oil to help loosen up any hairballs he may have.

My vet prescribed Xanax for my other cat, in tiny cat doses to calm her down. I picked it up from a pharmacy close by. There's other medications too, so it doesn't necessarily have to be Xanax.

            "Unlike her sister who sleeps with me, she likes to sleep downstairs, in the living room in her cat tree. She comes in bed for cuddles and a nap in the morning. \n\nLast week, the two days she was sick she slept with my the whole night. When she sleeps with me I have to sleep with my hand on her tummy and she curls her legs around my hand. We slept like this two whole nights in a row, waking up during the night when she was vomiting to clean up, and then going to bed again. She plays it hard and she is less cuddly and needy than her sister, so it was so unusual to have her cuddled up next to me for two nights. Now when she doesn\u2019t sleep with me it actually gives me comfort because I know she feels well enough to sleep on her own",
            "I will monitor her this weekend, and if she vomits again I will definitely take her back and ask them to get to the bottom of this. It\u2019s not normal for my cat to vomit",
            "And I am glad to hear your cat is well now",
            "We have two brothers, one never ever vomits and the other one likes to notify everyone with a \"MEOOWWWAHHHWAA, MEOOOWWWAHHAA...bleurgh!\" and proceeds to startle himself, leap backwards, projectile vomit in a lovely arc, run off, vomit somewhere else and then finish off in a third, sometimes fifth or sixth location. Without fail does this on carpet as well despite the hallway and conservatory being wooden floored and the bathroom and kitchen being tiled.",
            "Well there you go, around a quarter of all cats can vomit after eating grass.   \nSome cat's are bad at balancing how much grass they eat and may overdo it.",
            "Although OP, did the vet do any bloodwork to see if there were any thyroid issues or anything else? Sometimes the vomiting can be nothing, but it could be indicative of something more serious, which could happen in a younger cat if genetically predisposed. Hope your kitty stays well! She sounds crazy, but those are the best with their silly antics!",
            "For real my girls do the same",
            "Lol in my house we call it the PPZs (post-poop zoomies)",

            "Twiiiins! It's yours a tuxy too??",
            "Oh lord. That's the other thing. This is a water drinking cat. From every source. He has two water fountains, he likes to drink from the sink instead, and also knows how to smack the tub faucet after I shower to get the remaining water out. I've had him checked for dehydration in the past and the vet says he's one of the healthiest cats he's ever seen!",
            "She needs everyone to know.",
            "Nah, we know we\u2019re their pawns. We\u2019re super cool with it. Like hella super cool.",
            "My previous cat used to ask for the food we were eating and when we said no he would rage scratch the box throwing litter everywhere and poop. I always wondered if he held it in for this purpose because it was EVERY time lol (despite this, he really was the best cat haha)",
            "Lol razor mittens",

            "AHAHAHA! Sorry about all the messes you\u2019ve had to clean, but beautifully written!",
            "I think mine was separated from yours at birth. He does the same thing. 75% of our house is tiled but he still manages to vomit on carpet and furniture mostly. Or he will hide under some piece of furniture while we're sleeping or at work and vomit on the tile grout lines where it will dry and be impossible to clean off the grout when we find it several hours later.",
            "Mine managed to vomit on four different rugs in one day. Bless her heart...",

            "I see your point.  I think she may be confused about her identity. I keep calling her a cow and she may have believed it",
            "No he didn\u2019t do anything. She saw two vets and they both said they are not concerned. If she vomits again I will take her back and ask for tests",
            "What about your cats?",
            "Sorry for butting in glad to hear your boy is healthy and just being a cat.",
            "Well said. \n\nI\u2019m fine with it either way. \n\nMy wife\u2019s cat got me a 3rd date. \n\nThe lil gato jumped in my lap and started purring, so I naturally started petting it like a Bond villain. \n\nAnd I hear \u201cshe doesn\u2019t even do that me!\u201d\n\nCats be cats. She was a good kitty (RIP) who never messed with my stuff and always guarded me when I pooped. \n\nGood kitty.\n\nWe threw her a Box-Mitzvah for her 13th. And a Cat-cea\u00f1era for her 15th. \n\nSadly the tiny (cat sized) Barbie Jeep for her 16th didn\u2019t happen\u2026\n\nBut she was good.",
            "My sister\u2019s cat vomited underneath her covers and she didn\u2019t find out until she tried to go to sleep that night.",
            "After coming home a third time of cat vomit (...well to be fair, one was a legit hairball) I decided to get a water proof bed throw- 35 bucks. Not a single time have they puked or hairballed on the bed since \ud83d\ude44 I washed it and gave it to my sister who has a dog. I now use an old sheet and have more reason to believe those lovely furry fxckers were vomiting on the bed to be buttholes and make more laundry for me.",
            "She has the markings of a cow, so there\u2019s that.",
            "their secret, no cats.",
            "Thank you! I worry extra about him because we found him on the streets as a kitten, in the middle of a thunderstorm. So when I first held him and had to give him a flea bath he bled me good to teach me a lesson! He was literal skin and bones, and belly full of worms, so his growth was majorly stunted. If you look at my post history there's a before and after (about 4 years old versus after his first bath). Vet says he's most likely done growing, but is thriving at his permanent teenage size. If I miss one thing about the scraggly kitten, it was how much he used to cling to me, including screaming when I showered because he was scared I was drowning. Now he bends to no one's will. You will pet him at approved times and intervals,  and accept all biscuits. Or else. He'll give you a cold shoulder. \ud83d\ude06 \ud83e\udd23  sorry for mobile formatting and long-windedness.",

I wanted her transition to be peaceful and surrounded by loving people. \n\nIt was an honor to love you up to the very end. Thank you Helen for everything.

I got into TNR after I noticed some very unhealthy looking strays/ferals with kittens eating out of the dumpster at my work and it broke my heart . I started feeding them and then trapping them to get them fixed. I\u2019ve done 25 cats and currently all the kitties that live at my work are fixed. If you want to do something to help, you can buy a live trap and get in touch with a low cost spay/neuter program\u2026 some places like the humane society also have feral cat spay/neuter days once every month or so where you can them fixed very cheap, or some areas even have TNR groups that can come out help (none in my area, so I did it myself). Some places will also loan or rent out traps cheaply.  You can look into resources in your area and see if anyone can come help, or where you can get ferals/strays fixed cheap.\n\nThe best thing for those kitties is getting them fixed.  If you want to help at all, feel free to message me if you have any questions. Nothing breaks my heart more than seeing kittens born into these kinds situations.\n\nThanks for saving the little one.!

They won\u2019t hate you for it, every single one I\u2019ve trapped has forgiven me and not one has held a grudge against me for taking them to the vet.

            "Dude, I got the same kiddo, and I love him a lot!!! Take a look at the pic. For the suggestion, I would say:\n\nMaintain a stable environment by keeping furniture in the same place and ensuring their food and water bowls are always in the same location. Use sound cues and distinct smells to help them navigate, and provide plenty of attention and comfort to make them feel safe.\n\nHope your lovely sweet kiddo grow up safely and healthy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7s1txqc0w7d1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31d499407e004811bb532d1e1f1de6486f4710e9",

She has kitty herpes that took her sight and hearing as a newborn kitten from complications. She is 7 now and is more agile and ninja-like than my other cats. Only suggestions are to let friends/family (especially little kiddos) know how to approach her so kitty isn\u2019t startled. For Beans because she can\u2019t see or hear we stomp on the floor or pat the furniture she\u2019s sitting on, she feels the vibration \ud83e\udd79. Other suggestion as others mentioned is not to leave large items out of place, for us it\u2019s leaving doors ajar that does Beans in\u2026 bonks her little noggin \ud83d\ude2c\n\nLong story short, kitty will adapt amazingly once she figures out the map of her kitty kingdom.",
            "Waffle has an estimated 10-20% vision in his one eye, and he responds best to my voice, or toys with brights lights or that make noise. Like others have said, try not to re-arrange big furniture too much. Waffle has a mild crisis anytime we move the trash can; I'd hate to think what would happen if we moved the couch.\n\nHe will stop walking more often than our other cats, and you can hear him sniffing so hard he grunts - he uses smell to navigate as much as he does the shadows and noises. It's kinda funny to hear him \"rooting around\" under the bed when he's trying to chase a toy.\n\nAbove all, I make sure he knows he's safe and loved in this house. He hates going outside, likes meeting new people (and their smells), and has a best friend named Shrimp - who grew up from a kitten emulating this blind moron, so Shrimp will intentionally run into things when he has the zoomies. Like, full-on face first into doors and corners.\n\nOnly because Waffle did that, and only because Waffle couldn't see to stop in time.

            "Try not to move furniture a lot blind cats/dogs need to remember where everything is, and will not be familiar with new furniture but let them explore the house, and any hair or dough making is him trying to mark things as his, try not to make loud noises like blenders or screaming since he\u2019s half blind he probably has his other senses heighten up a bit",

            "Vet here.  Looks like he\u2019s got microopthalmia.  I\u2019d just be a bit worried those eyes are sore - just looking at the tearing occurring with both eyes.  Have you got any lubricating eye drops?  He might also have entropion (the eyelids roll inwards) and this can cause the eyelashes to rub in the cornea (surface of the eye) which is painful.  Make sure you take him to a vet you trust.  I had a friend who had a cat with pretty much the same condition and he ended up having both eyes removed to stop the discomfort - it was the best thing for that cat as he couldn\u2019t see anyway and leaving the eyes there was significantly reducing the quality of his life.",

We didn't know he was blind when we adopted him. We just noticed that he walked around the house slowly, and he was not bothered at all but our other kitties or our 5 Shar-Pei that we had at the time.\nThe most amazing thing is that I think all of the cats and dogs noticed before we did. They were all very calm around him, loved him, and seemed to be very protective of him. It was the sweetest thing ever! We did nothing different, they are very smart! They just kind of get acclimated to their surroundings, and pretty quickly. I just didn't move furniture as much as I used to. We called him NORMAN ROOMBA, because he would occasionally walk into a wall, furniture, or dog toy in his path, and he would just redirect to the left or right, just like our Roomba \ud83d\ude01\nWe loved him so very much and miss him terribly.\nCongrats on your special little purrrrbaby! \n*",
            "Hey, congrats on adopting this little cutie! That\u2019s such a big-hearted thing to do \ud83c\udf37!   \nHere are some tips to make her life easier: Put multiple food and water bowls in different rooms so she can always find something to eat and drink. Using placemats can help keep things clean. Make sure places like her litter box and sleeping spots are easy to access by building small ramps. To keep her safe, cushion sharp corners on furniture and use barriers to prevent her from getting to dangerous areas like stairs. Offer her cozy spots in each room where she can retreat, especially when you have guests or it gets noisy. Always announce yourself when entering a room to avoid startling her, and consider using stress-relieving products like pheromones if you\u2019re hosting a big event. Lastly, always secure windows and doors to prevent her from getting stuck or hurt. You\u2019re going to make a wonderful team!! \ud83d\ude3b\n\n![gif](giphy|rMNaA4yiYDNPq|downsized)",

She can get up and down furniture really easily, but when it's a new piece of furniture, she'll sometimes need help getting down the first time or two.

Try not to move furniturww too often or leave 'temporary' stuff (ex: delivery boxes) in places that are normally empty.  If you watch your blind baby, you'll see that as they develop routines for noving around your home they get more and more confident.

            "Hello! I have an almost complete blind kitty I\u2019ve had since a kitten. My best recommendation is to let him/her explore your home by themselves-avoid picking them up and doing things for them. Their little paws have sweat glands that leave a scent and the blind cat will use it to navigate around the home. It\u2019s hard to tell if a car is blind (if they are in a place they know) because they adapt so easily.\n\nPut padding on corners, etc, because even they they are blind they will most definitely love to play and runabout and accidents will happen.\n\nIntroduce yourself when you go up to them so they don\u2019t get startled (won\u2019t have to do this in the future they get used to your scent)\n\n\nNoisy toys!!! Whilst it may be a bit irritating to hear, your kitty still needs mental stimulation (my cat\u2019s favourite is crinkly one\u2019s)\n\n\nAnd obviously don\u2019t let them out, find a designated kitty litter spot and don\u2019t change it. \u2014same with food!!!\n\n\nGood luck :)",

It's easier for them if they're born blind or go blind as kittens. I don't need any special accommodations for mine. He finds the litter boxes on his own and uses them reliably. He has a mental map of the house and gets around just as well as my cats that can see. He definitely finds the food. You'll do fine, and so will the baby.",
            "One of my cats, Cassie, went blind in her old age when she was still with me, so I\u2019m not sure if this would help. But I would suggest having rugs down if you don\u2019t already. Rugs, or some kind of mat, where the food dish is, the litter box, to the couch, etc.\n\nWhen Cassie was blind, she would follow the edges of the rugs to find her way. She would follow my voice to get to me, and along the way I noticed she would follow the edges of the rugs. She would walk into table legs too, then she would redirection herself and walk the rug until she found the edge and follow it to me. When she would reach the end of one, she would be on normal floor, as would slow down till she felt a new rug under her paws and continued following. She was really smart with it",
            "Interesting thing I learned after adopting my blind cat is how easy it is to forget she's blind, because she acts mostly like a regular cat. You should make sure that you like your furniture layout because it's the one you should stick to for the sake of your cat, also the cat would appreciate that you \"show\" it things with sound. I learned to rub my fingers while approaching my cat before touching her, she could get very stressed. I do that with every cat now automatically.

            "I have two blind cats, they have scar tissue so they can see light but that\u2019s about it. First thing I do whenever we moved with them is place them in the bathroom as I got the litter box set up elsewhere. Once it\u2019s done I placed each cat in the litter box one at a time then they could map out the rest of the house themselves. Same thing goes with new furniture, I got a new cat tree I place them at the top one at a time and I tap my fingers down each step so they can hear where to go. I once had a vet tell me my cats were probably terrible at mapping and it pissed me off so much. Honestly you wouldn\u2019t even know my cats are blind they\u2019re so fucking smart it\u2019s scary. They know when something\u2019s been moved and they\u2019ll sniff, feel around, and if I\u2019m available I\u2019ll do the tapping thing. Otherwise once you give them time to map out the place they\u2019re good to go. My girl one loves to perch up super high, I got a 6\u2019 3\u201d cat tree for her and it makes her so happy. My cats also love crinkle toys or string toys that have some form of plastic in them so when you drag it on the ground they can hear. Additionally I\u2019ve created songs for morning, nighttime, and meal time routines. This way they understand what\u2019s going on but then again they can tell time really well now and get pissed when I don\u2019t feed them on time haha. My cats absolutely love tv. They love the noise and flashing lights so we play SpongeBob regularly, it is consistent noise, you\u2019ll notice SpongeBob\u2019s track doesn\u2019t change that much with laughter and music. Lastly I use a water fountain so they can hear it running, I give lysine for eye health recommended by my vet, and I do not burn anything scented. I also have recently refrained from scented shampoo and do not use perfume but the boy cat is asthmatic. If you use heavily scented stuff they may have problems finding the litter box and pee elsewhere. Don\u2019t change litter too quickly, do it slowly. \n\nOk I think I covered everything. lol. Best of luck with your new kitty!",

            "Depending on the severity of the blindness. I would suggest things that can help the kitten while they move around the house. Knowing where they are would really help them relax.\n\nSome things that come to mind are wall socket lights. Some are daylight activated\nThese could be landmarks for the kitten to orient itself in the dark. Might also be useful to have them on 24/7 if the kitten can only see light.\nMaube setup their feeding area near a wall socket with a light.\n\nAnother thing you could do is use their other senses.\n\nFor example you could use certain smells for certain rooms. Try to be careful to pick smells that won't be harmful but have a distinct smell.  Sawdust or Grass comes to mind.\n\nA water fountain that isn't silent would be beneficial over a silent water fountain or water bowl.\n\nI'm pretty sure places that do arts and crafts might have stuff like christmas bells. This could work to help orient the cat if you pick different sizes and sounds. You could setup a \"sound map\" in their head. \n\n\nI've never had to do this just thinking outside the box for you. Maybe you'll get a great idea from these suggestions. I'm certain there's a way to implement these effectively for a blind cat. I simply haven't thought of the details. \n\nI think the texture under their paws might be a way to help guide them around but that could be a lot of work and renovation intensive. Maybe a carpet or car mat where they eat?",

Of course situations will arise when you have to.\n\nWhen I first got elvis he had trouble finding his water. I gave him wet food with some water mixed in to give the water a scent for him to find. Eventually I left the water where I was giving the wet food. \n\nMost cats when introduced to a new home will find a safe nook to hide in for a while to get acclimated. Elvis just hunkered down in the middle of the floor. But when I gave him a pet he'd scurry aware a little and sit again. I think this was his version of finding a safe nook, he just didn't realize it was the middle of the room. So even though he was within reach, I left him alone to give him time to get acclimated. \n\nOthers have said don't move furniture or food/water, but another is litter. Just a way for them to get oriented. \n\nLast thing from me I can think of his consider pet stairs for things you want them to get on. Elvis would get frustrated not knowing how to get to me when I was on my bed, and when he wanted to get down he'd get frustrated not knowing how far down it was.

She responded well to high pitched yelps of (often simulated) pain until she learned not to bite or claw hard.

            "I had an indoors cat as a child that I used to take for walks on a harness in a nearby park once per day after school. Something that I thought the cat would enjoy (and he did) because he was super active and energetic. \n\nThe cat got used to the routine so much that it would stand on a cabinet which was by the door, jiggling the door handle, meowing so bloody loudly, asking to be let out whenever I didn\u2019t/was late to take it outside for its daily walk. Sometimes I just couldn\u2019t take the cat outside due to weather/other responsibilities and I felt very bad whenever that happened because the poor cat loved it so much and would go crazy for hours if I skipped a day. He also started trying to escape outdoors whenever the outside door was opened. Many times I had to run after him, hoping he comes back home and doesn\u2019t run off towards a busy road instead. \n\nSo unless you\u2019re seriously committed and have some dedicated spare time every day to take your cat outside routinely, I wouldn\u2019t introduce it to the outdoors because you might end up regretting it due to all the stress it may cause to you and the cat.\n\nAnd as many have said already, cats really don\u2019t need to spend any time outdoors to lead a fulfilling life.",

He was a stray for the first 1.5 years of life before I adopted him and kept escaping any time I so much as cracked the door open. If it weren\u2019t for that I never would have tried. I did it to keep him safe, not entertain myself. Leashed walks are still a risk and not one I\u2019d take for fun. \n\nAs much as I loved our walks I was relieved when he lost interest all on his own. I moved to a larger space on a busier street and he decidedly chose his safe territory. I haven\u2019t walked him in a few years now but kept the leash in case he changes him mind. \n\nSo idk if we\u2019re swapping tips I\u2019d say don\u2019t show your cat what they are missing in the future? Can\u2019t close Pandora\u2019s box once it\u2019s open."

            "My cat used to be. We took a video of her playing fetch. She has never done it since. Cats....",
            "My little weirdo likes playing fetch with drinking straws.",
            "Springs YES!!!  \n\nNot sure hair ties are safe.  Might want to google that.",
            "My ten year old is not as obsessed with them as she was when she was a few months old and I purchased them.  But she still initiate a game of fetch now and then.  When she was a kitty, everyday when I got home from work she\u2019d grab a spring and come to wherever I was and drop it at my feet.  I would then take a few minutes to play fetch with her.  In the beginning it use to blow my ex\u2019s mind because he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes seeing a cat playing fetch.  He said, \u201cShe think she\u2019s a damn dog.\u201d  Oh, and just a couple of years ago, I discovered my cat was gathering a bunch of her springs and piling them in one big pile on her food tray.",
            "My cat steals literally anything she can pick up. They either end up in my bedroom or the corner of the bathroom.",
            "Mine doesn't play fetch, but she might bat those around. Where'd you find them?\n\n\nShe's a bit of a weirdo when it comes to being a normal cat. Won't play with normal cat toys, bought her a catnip plant and it turned into a tree, can somehow tell the difference between a fake feather and a real one, prefers the cardboard scratchers over a post. It's been a struggle to find toys she'll play with but these springs aren't the conventional cat toy so I think she might play with them.",
            "Mine is obsessed with playing fetch with...I don't even want to say it because it's so embarrassing...with vegetables. \n\nHe's always hanging around during dinner preparation, waiting to get his paws on any stray food that falls on the floor accidentally. He'll scoop it up and run away with it. Then he'll hide it for a rainy day when he wants to play fetch. \n\nI've been brought slimy slices of cucumber, wilted spring onions, shriveled up carrot pieces, sloppy lettuce...you name it, and he brings it. \n\nIt's so gross, but it makes me laugh at the same time. And yes, I do throw them for him to play fetch. I'm not a heartless monster! \ud83d\ude04",
            "Yes! It's not a spring technically but it is springy and my baby loves playing fetch with it.",
            "Mine is. And then my dog destroys them. As she does with all my kitten\u2019s toys \ud83d\ude2d",
            "My black void! He loves springs but only the too short to be a slinky ones (fidget toy) and only when they're messed up. He also loves those cheap little rubber bracelets",
            "Is this a Russian blue?",
            "I had no idea springs and cats were a thing. TIL",
            "Mine was from 5-10 months old but not so much anymore.  Hoping it will return as it was a game I could play with him as I work at my desk. e favorite thing now is the laser pen.",

            "Nope. My girl used to play fetch as a baby. My lazy behind loved it\ud83d\ude02\nSadly she doesn't care anymore. And the springs aren't interesting to her at all",
            "Yeah one of our Cats loves them, the other two are not bothered \ud83d\ude02",
            "I get this with hair ties from one cat and those sparkly poof balls from the other. After a good toss or two they\u2019ll start the victory cries in whichever acoustic room of the place is currently vacant.",
            "Those are always crowd pleasers in my house. I don't drink milk so my dad saves them up to give to me.",
            "My cats love those too. A friend sent me a box of pull tabs from milk jugs. \ud83d\ude06",
            "I had a cat named Dinky as a kid who would carry around milk rings. He loved them. When his food bowl was low, he would throw a milk ring in it. I always felt he was tipping whoever fed him.",
            "Haha same here! My cat knows when I\u2019ve opened a new carton and comes running for it.",
            "Yup mine too!! definitely an item that ends up in the spring pile under my head at night if left out \ud83d\ude02",
            "I save all of them and have a baggie full of about 300 blue plastic milk rings.\n\nThe washing machine broke years ago, and someone came to deliver the new one and take out the old one, and I found about 50 milk rings under it\n\nCats seem to prefer free stuff like milk rings, pen caps and ice cubes over nice expensive toys. Although my current cat loves toy mice",
            "Yes to both",
            "Milk rings!  I once captured my cat who\u2019d gotten outside by leaving her a milk ring in the porch after letting it drop on the ground and make that distinctive milk ring noise. Irrisistable. She used to fetch them if i threw them",
            "Both for me! One cat has nothing but rings of all sizes- we also take them off of a juice bottle (and one really large one off of a huge plastic tomato sauce jar). We play fetch constantly. \n\nThe second boy loves springs most.\n\nMy girl isn't interested in either of them.",
            "Bread bag clips. The club can't even handle her right now.",
            "It\u2019s ear plugs in our house lol",

            "Somewhere in your house is a hidden stash of them, under a piece of furniture.",
            "Are there 100ct bags??? My SIC loves these but they're always getting lost.",
            "Mine will chase and let you throw it again, but eventually she stashes them in the shower. Suddenly there are 6+ springs in there.",
            "Mine are this way too. They will play with them alone as well. I even have a toy gun that shoots balls and one that shoots disc's for them to chase lol",
            "So beautiful!",
            "Savannah or Bengal?  He's awesome",

            "I\u2019m wondering this too! There are so many different toys that seem more like prey lol. Thinking maybe it\u2019s because of the way they bounce around when smacked",
