        "content": "I work as a server in a small restaurant and I'm pretty sure everyone knows that whenever a customer doesn't finish their meal or ask for it to be boxed up, we obviously throw it away. But for the past few weeks or so instead of throwing the food away after my customes are done with their meal, I have been eating the leftovers remaining on their plates.\n\nWe are not allowed to do this so I just quickly scarfed it down when I returned the plates to the back and no one was looking. It was going okay until I suddenly got sick, turned out that I had Hepatitis A. It's been awful, I couldn't hold down food for days not to mention that I have been looking like a minion for a week now.\n\nI had no choice but to report it at work and I also decided that it was a good idea to come clean about how I probably got it which almost got me fired. I'm lucky that I got away with only a warning but l also can't work for the next two weeks. I guess it's the consequences of my own actions. At least I still have a job.\n\nTL:DR I ate customers leftovers, caught a contagious disease and almost got fired.\n\n\n",

            "So I do case investigation for hep A. \n\nEither someone in your workplace is not washing their hands and has it, you're using under cooked shellfish or unwashed produce in your food or you got this somewhere else. Hep A spreads fecal orally, so unwashed hands or basically putting something contaminated by poop in your mouth. Or you couldve traveled somewhere where it's endemic (i.e Pakistan, India, Columbia etc)\n My point is, hep A has a notoriously long incubation period (the period where you get the disease to when you start symptoms), you must have gotten it somewhere else. \n\nDepending on where you're located...if you are in the states /europe or Canada, this would've been immediate public health involvement. You would've gotten a case investigation, along with an exclusion from work (Your work cannot fire you for this, but they have to give you time off until you come back negative for the virus) because of your infectiousness. There would've been a massive vaccination clinic put in place for all those who ate at your restaurant  in a time period before you started your jaundice symptoms.  Your place should've been inspected and your coworkers also tested for the virus if they were ill during a certain time period. \n\nPlus side- once you get hep A you're immune for life, however , people around you really need that hep A prophylaxis to be safe themselves.",

I viewed that as roughly as safe as when I lived in the meth lab.",

He\u2019d been standing back there for who knows how long snacking out of the waste cups where customers put their spitty edamame pods.

Food pantries are a wonderful resource. I can help you locate a few. If you are in the US (as I am), you may qualify for food assistance programs (such as SNAP). Call your local health department and the nice people there can connect you up to someone who can help. \n\nSome are hesitant to use these resources because they don\u2019t want to be seen as a burden or \u201ctaking advantage\u201d. Know that you are a valuable human being who deserves food. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to save the energy you are spending on stressing over where your next meal is coming from and investing it in other areas that will help you become more food secure?

To start, our relationship has always been challenging, We dated for two years locally and now we are one year into long distance. We have been talking about becoming a more serious couple, starting a family and living together in the next few years.\n\nWe finally set a date that works best for me to move, this September. Previously we thought it would be sometime early next year but this works out better for his current lease and my current situation. This set him off as it's pretty close, his initial reaction to me moving in September was extremely worried. He's worried about having to change his current routines to fit me into his life and living situation. \n\nHe has several symptoms that I've noticed over the three years we've dated, a few of which have caused extreme problems in the relationship.\n\n* Introvert/ social anxiety when in unfamiliar settings to the point we have to leave\n* Lots of anxiety in general\n* Easily annoyed when disturbed from his routines (Everything is on his time)\n* Complete inability to express feelings and emotions and has a difficult time recognizing or understanding other's emotions\n*  Lack of affection and constantly needs to be asked to show affection\n*  Withdraws in any stressful conversation or situation\n*  Very rigid work/ food/ gym/ sleep routine. \n*  Extreme interest in a highly specific field of academia that he is highly successful in\n*  Struggles with 'common sense'\n\nYou may or may not agree with my conclusions based off of this list. I'm not a doctor, but I have been around him for years and truly think that he may be on the spectrum. We have struggled a lot with his communication and constantly shutting down conversations. \n\n**Here's where I fucked up,** I told him in the most caring and gentle way that I think he may have some symptoms of autism. He became extremely upset and started saying that I think he is a r\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*d. I tried to explain that I don't think that he is dumb and I actually think he is incredibly smart. I tried reassuring him and he said he doesn't want to talk and to leave him alone. I texted him and apologized, I told him it was never my intention to hurt his feelings and that I would love him regardless.  \n\nI don't know what to do about the situation, I know I fucked up. Honestly, I just didn't know how to bring it up.  Or if I was wrong for even thinking this. I feel like shit because I know he thinks I'm a jerk for suggesting it. \n\nAdvice is welcome.\n\nTL;DR: I noticed some symptoms of autism in my boyfriend and brought it up, now he hates me.",

Simply because, from what you\u2019ve described in your post, he isn\u2019t receptive to that kind of conversation. \n\nIf anyone that has been in a 3 year relationship can\u2019t have these kind of difficult conversations with their partner, it\u2019s a HUGE red flag and sharing a living space with one another shouldn\u2019t be on  the table, let alone have a planned date. \n\nI understand wanting to be patient with him, but if you\u2019re anything like me, you need to be asking yourself this, \u201cam I looking for him to get a diagnosis for him or for me?\u201d \n\nWhen I was going through a similar situation, I kept looking for explanations that would justify the way my partner at the time was treating me. He ended up being diagnosed with bipolar schizophrenia and I stayed with him for way too long because I told myself that the mistreatment was directly related to his diagnosis. \n\nRegardless of his diagnosis and all the logical explanations, I was miserable. On top of that, he became violent, I justified it as he was \u201cdifferent\u201d mentally. Well, I was still miserable, and it wasn\u2019t until he tried to kill me that I snapped out of it. \n\nI am now years later in a wonderful, healthy relationship with the most amazing person I have ever met. We are both able to have any and all conversations that we need, and every time we\u2019ve shared a concern about one another, it\u2019s been addressed in a way that we both feel comfortable with.\n\nI\u2019m typing this to you as a person formally diagnosed with Autism, ADHD, and BPD. I know what it\u2019s like to struggle but I would never excuse treating someone I love poorly because of my diagnoses. \n\nIf your partner can\u2019t be realistic about conversations that matter, put yourself first and get the fuck out of that relationship.",

You either have it or you don\u2019t. If you don\u2019t, congrats, you got the easier path. If you do, then that won\u2019t change regardless of whether you pay it any mind. \u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s internalized ableism, they don\u2019t want something to be \u201cwrong\u201d with them.\u00a0",

It sounds like there are a lot of needs that he just isn\u2019t meeting - or willing to try to meet.",
            "I\u2019m diagnosed autistic, and I remember being called the r slur a lot at school. It was soul destroying- a way of marking out certain people as something less than human. Kids are also really good at noticing who\u2019s different, even if you keep your diagnosis secret like I did; I swear they make better diagnosticians than a lot of doctors.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say here is that he probably had similar experiences and is traumatised. Autism is extremely stigmatised and regularly shamed. You didn\u2019t fuck up at all, but society has fucked him up. \n\nPersonally, I think we do best in relationships with our own neurotype. That\u2019s nothing personal, it\u2019s just a fact. Think about whether you want to be with someone like him.",

What if he's just afraid of commitment and not affectionate but neurotypical? \n\nI do think he's being a dick by just sulking rather than talking, but if I was in his place then yea... I might be annoyed a partner is armchair diagnosing me rather than discussing actual issues they have in our relationship. \n\nSo like, If you didn't, its worth having a conversation about the things that bother you rather than bringing up autism. But if you did and he reacted the same way then well, tbh time to evaluated whether moving in is a good idea bc it might just be a bad fit for the both of you.",
            "Yeah, offering a diagnosis of a psychiatric condition to someone who didn't ask your advice is almost always a bad idea. As you can see, it didn't help manage the issues at hand and just made him mad. You're also not a professional. I could have told you not to do this.",

He can\u2019t stand disruptions to his routine? Don\u2019t have a baby with him. The problem is not his possible autism, it\u2019s that you should be walking away to find what you want or choosing to be happy with him as a spectrumy person who may never be able to happily give you what you want. The name for his group of behaviors/symptoms doesn\u2019t matter if he isn\u2019t looking for it. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re both amazing people but this does happen and it\u2019s heartbreaking.",
            "I am in a relationship like this, but successfully so. I am on the spectrum. I did not know this for a long time, but suspected it. After living with my girlfriend for many years, she has agreed with me.\n\nSo, from my perspective, it was sort of a self-discovery thing for me. But had she told me instead of me figuring it out, I would have been fine with that.\n\nWhat you have written is basically me. However, I have learned that when my routines break, it is usually because something unexpected happens. Social situations can be stressful, so I highly recommend not requiring him to do too many social situations. Family stuff -- definitely do those. If you all have some friends, no problem. But large parties or going to places with tons of people? That would require a lot of advanced notice.\n\nWhen I go on vacation, my partner finds links and videos of each thing we're going to do. Then I watch them and read through them so I know what to expect. It helps a lot, actually, with vacationing.\n\nI cannot generalize what will work with others with autism. But what I do know is if you can understand his needs a bit, and cater to them when reasonable, I think it is extremely fair for him to do the same for you. If you become part of his routine, that is important.\n\nThe affection part is difficult. Requiring anyone to be told to show affection can even make the affection seem forced. Forced hugs and kisses, for example, are also terrible. Reading that book on love languages can often help understand how a neurodivergent person expresses affection. I believe there is a neurodivergent love languages book, too.\n\nAnyway, in a relationship where someone has autism, their partner does have to do a bit more work to understand that person. It is difficult to ask someone to \"just be different.\" I know you have not asked that of him, but you get what I mean. But it is ENTIRELY REASONABLE for you to want to be part of his routines, because if you are not, then you will always be on the outside. You do not need to become part of every routine he has. But, for example, establish a few routines together, like watching shows before bed, going on a date once a week at the same time and day, etc...",

            "This is kind of a TIFU only because it seems a little weird to bring it up in that context. Like you might be 100% correct, but what would that information add to the situation? An autism diagnosis isn't going to make the coming changes any easier to navigate, it's not like they can prescribe pills for that (and if they can please give me some, since I'm also autistic and don't handle routine changes well at all). So it's not really a bad thing to bring up, but the timing is maybe a little questionable.\n\nHis reaction makes the TIFU more on his end that yours though. There's nothing wrong with being autistic, so getting upset and flinging slurs just because someone raised the possibility is kind of a red flag that he might actually be a bit ableist about it. As others are pointing out it could also be that he's worried you're ableist and going to treat him differently, but that's still not a great defense for the slur. \n\nSeems like an easy fight to recover from though, so hopefully you guys (mostly him) calm down and talk it out better. Not a particularly big fuck up and if it snowballs into one then that's probably just you dodging a bullet to be honest, this is nowhere near the kind of comment that should ruin a healthy relationship.",

I would just let it rest and adress the immediate topics.\n\nDid you live together already or would this be the first time moving together? For some people it needs some real time to adapt.

Now I\u2019m in my 30s I\u2019m a normal well adjusted human being in a healthy relationship with my loving gf. \n\nWhat I\u2019m getting at is maybe he knows but wishes he wasn\u2019t\u2026 without a diagnosis he has some sort of hope and perhaps felt that bubble burst.

If you notice they arent their normal self and cleaning up or doing the things they care about for months, you might talk to them about looking into depression and seeing if thats something they need help with.

She told him she noticed things and that he should investigate and possibly GET diagnosed by real trained specialists. And if he doesnt want to, thats fine! Shes just offering her insight to her PARTNER of multiple years which is what someone should do in that situation. \n\nThe point of getting diagnosed is to get help because now you know what youre dealing with.

That particular aspect can exist on its own, and doesn't require an autism diagnosis, it requires a therapist.\n\nMaybe it's best to simply suggest a medical professional rather than prescribing your partner with a diagnosis.

            "If you notice traits in your partner that knowing what it is could help them in their life, you absolutely should tell them. Neurological things cant always BE noticed by the person who has them. People who are suffering with Bipolar or BPD might have always just been told theyre overly emotional. People who are on the spectrum might have just been told they're weird and they never looked into it more. Thats why someone like a partner who knows them intimately can be someone to trigger that path of getting a diagnosis because you dont always see those things about yourself.\n\nAnd this whole \"he didnt ask to be diagnosed\". Who ASKS to be diagnosed by someone not a professional? And she also DIDNT diagnose him. She said ive noticed these symptoms, you should go GET diagnosed if youre interested in that. \n\nYou dont need to have expertise or training on a condition to notice signs of something. If my partner had weeks where they were really happy and then weeks where they were really sad and high mood swings out of nowhere, id ask them if they noticed and had looked at being bipolar or if they felt manic.\n\nIt is NOT a bad thing to talk to your partner about things you notice about them. I dont get why you or anyone would think thats bad. Especially when its someone youve spent years with and plan to be together with for the long term. You shouldnt just go up to random people calling them autistic, but if you notice traits in your partner, then you can have a conversation with them!",
            "Yes, the thinking has changed, and I really don\u2019t have the time to educate you other than what I explained, sorry. You\u2019ll just have to take it from someone fully on the autistic spectrum. You can probably research it yourself with a few simple google searches if you\u2019re interested.",
            "I have no problem with the notion that we're all on the spectrum neurologically but being so directly involved in creating inclusive policies in my work specifically for Autistic people I have found that mainly people from the Autistic community don't like this expression as it diminishes and downplays the challenges and barriers they face.\n\n\nLike I said, not my opinion but one I hear a lot",
            "Oh for sure. I am not saying he shouldn\u2019t get evaluated. I\u2019m asking more like does it bother you that he has a hard time showing you affection? Or having difficult conversations? Even if he gets a diagnosis, those things will likely continue to pop up long term.",
            "It shouldn't, unless we're concluding that non-autistic people should be forced out of their comfort zones or something. Maybe we're speaking too generally, some specific examples would probably help. Could you provide some where you'd treat someone differently based purely on their autism diagnosis?\n\nLike the people in my life bend over backwards to work around my issues and preferences, which has a massive impact on my lifestyle and theirs by extension (especially my wife for obvious reasons). However, I was only diagnosed a few years ago and they were already doing that beforehand, because the important part was the \"issues and preferences\" not the autism diagnosis. But everyone has issues and preferences, that's not a unique thing that only has to be respected when someone is on the spectrum.\n\nAnd to be clear it's also not a \"get your way all the time\" pass either. You need to be able to compromise sometimes, which also goes for autistic people. Just because I'd prefer something one way doesn't mean it can always be that way all of the time, it's still important to pick your battles and know when to back down just like anyone else.\n\nAll I'm saying is that you should care about what the other person wants and needs in a relationship, and they should care about your wants and needs. The specifics of how to balance those things is going to be unique for every combination of two people regardless of their autism power levels, so it just seems very weird to frame it as an autism issue (and for once seems almost ableist against allistics, like their preferences aren't as worthy of consideration).",
            "I doubt a lot of them have ever had a relationship, let alone a good one, to be fair.\n\nIt makes me wonder; what do they actually want in a partner? What do they talk about every day?",
            "I\u2019ve just been doing that and as I understand it everyone has autistic traits but you\u2019d need a high number that were affecting your life for diagnosis. \n\nI think you\u2019d need to be qualified as a psychologist or something similar to know the answer.",
            "Not sure why you were downvoted. These are important questions that OP should ask themselves.",
            "Yes, you need to get down to why you guys have a hard time communicating with each other. Because a diagnosis is just going to confirm or deny your suspicions but it won\u2019t change the fact that you communicate differently. For myself I struggle with someone who implies things in conversation and I take their word at face value and in return I say exactly what I mean outright and don\u2019t imply anything. The problem is the person is asking what I mean by what I am saying and I say \u201cexactly what I said\u201d they will draw a different meaning. It was only recently we discovered the difference after multiple discussions, and we took the phrase  \u201cNever attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by incompetence or stupidity\u201d and we swap out incompetence and stupidity for misunderstanding. So whenever one of us is bothered by the other we will sit and think about what that person really means before reacting or let them know how it\u2019s coming off to the other person and they can explain better what they mean. This might not be the same for you because your communication issues could be completely different but trying to figure out what the other person\u2019s intention and what they\u2019re trying to say is a good start.",
            ">Could you provide some where you\u2019d treat someone differently based purely on their autism diagnoses? \n\nI didn\u2019t say autistic people need special accommodations or treatment over anyone else for their relationships to work. I said being aware of a diagnoses would change how the involved parties might feel about a standard relationship issue (such as the timeline around moving in together) and what actions they might take together to resolve it.\n\nAnd while people *should* care about their partners, just about all of us have experienced the opposite at some point in time. The knowledge of that possibility definitely taints our gut reactions and intrusive thoughts in every scenario, even with new partners. *Knowing* that someone is too painfully literal to play games and loves you dearly, but just needs a lot of room and time for their model trains or whatever, takes the anxiety away from the neurotypical partner and makes it easier to explore alternative options about the timeline of living together. Similarly, *knowing* that a partner sees and loves you as you are, and isn\u2019t just checking items off the life list with whoever is around and looks like they could be made to fit in that box, makes it easier on the neurodivergent partner to feel safe enough to explore those options as well. \n\nTo address the rest of your post, I\u2019m also on the spectrum. There are certain things I just cannot do or tolerate. I\u2019m aware of them because I\u2019ve already tried and failed to change them so that I can be like everyone else, and as they are clearly not \u2018preferences\u2019, I don\u2019t need a \u201cget my way\u201d pass - I\u2019m just unable to compromise on these things, and that\u2019s that. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t think conflicting needs don\u2019t matter or that it\u2019s everyone else\u2019s job to change, but the fact remains that a compatible partner will have to accept these things to be with me, much as they\u2019d have to accept a pet allergy or dietary restriction. \n\nIt\u2019s perfectly fair if a potential partner isn\u2019t interested in that, but all I can do is make sure they\u2019re making an informed decision. That\u2019s where diagnoses and self-awareness is most helpful.",
            "Everyone has traits that could be construed as autistic, but yes it\u2019s the intensity of those traits and the specific combination of them, along with a few specific traits that are exclusive to autism that neurotypical people just won\u2019t have, that makes someone autistic.\n\nThat\u2019s different than saying \u201ceveryone\u2019s a little autistic.\u201d That just diminishes the struggle autistic people go through.\n\nAnd I actually know more about autism than the clinical psychologist I see because I\u2019ve researched it more than she has, she absolutely is willing to learn from me on the subject, I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t as well. Have a good day!",
            "I\u2019m sorry to have upset you. I made my comment in the spirit of an ally. The point I was clumsily trying to make is that it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interests to treat people with autism with more compassion and understanding.\n\nYour politeness comes off as more patronising and insincere than genuine but maybe we can both agree to try to be a bit more open-minded and kinder. I was only asking my questions to try and learn a bit more."

Suddenly, reality snapped back with a jolt \u2014 my wallet was gone, swiped clean by a nimble-fingered thief.\n\nDriven by a surge of adrenaline and anger, I made a split-second decision that would haunt me. Ignoring all logic, I chased after the culprit through bustling streets, dodging pedestrians and ducking into narrow alleyways. Miraculously, I caught up to him and confronted him, demanding my wallet back.\n\nWhat followed was straight out of a clich\u00e9 action movie \u2014 heated words in broken French, a scuffle, and yes, even a baguette swung in defense (though, sadly, not by me). In the chaos, I managed to wrestle my wallet back, but my victory was short-lived.\n\nBefore I could savor my triumph, the sound of police sirens shattered the scene. Turns out, vigilantism isn't exactly smiled upon in the heart of Paris. Amid confused explanations and awkward language barriers, I found myself in a cramped jail cell, surrounded by fellow tourists and disgruntled locals.\n\nHours later, after much bureaucratic ado and a crash course in French penal code, I was released with a warning about the perils of taking justice into my own hands. As for the pickpocket, well, he likely slipped away to pick another day.\n\nLesson learned the hard way: next time, I'll secure my belongings and leave crime-fighting to the professionals \u2014 or at least refrain from swinging baked goods in the pursuit of justice.\n\n\nTL;DR: Got pickpocketed in Paris, chased down the thief like a wannabe action hero, ended up in a French jail cell for my troubles.

Long story short we were all heavily drinking for a friend's 21st birthday and things got out of hand, we had someone planning to DD but they also started drinking so we had to take an uber home. There was a group of 6 of us but there were no options for a vehicle with enough seats so we had to get 2, it was me and a friend named chloe in one car then the rest in the other.\r  \n\r  \nThe part where I fucked up was putting in a completely different address and not double checking it with the host,  keep in mind all of us were supposed to go back to the same house. Finally he dropped us off at what i thought was the host's house.\r  \n\r  \nAt this point i don't remember much but apparently we walked right in and fell asleep on the couch, i don't even recall what the house looked like we just walked right in and went to sleep. Next thing i know i woke up to a woman screaming and telling us she's gonna call the cops. I was still blackout drunk and couldn't understand what was going but i remember her on the phone looking like he was talking with the police.\r  \n\r  \nIt took every ounce of focus to get my shit together and figure out what was going on, finally i realized we were in some random woman's house. I panicked and pulled chloe up then walked us both outside. Now we were in the middle of the street while she was still screaming at us from the house swearing. My phone was dead and chloe was half asleep. I someone got her to tell me the PIN to her phone and ordered another uber as fast as possible.\r  \n\r  \nWe got away just before the cops came and we ended up going to chloe's house because we still couldn't find their address. I'm freaking out because what if they have cameras and got our face. Ffs im never drinking again. \r  \n\r  \nTL;DR: Me and a friend got extremely drunk and ordered an uber to the wrong house. We walked right in and slept on the couch then woke up to the homeowner screaming at us and calling the police. We managed to leave before the cops showed up but i'm never doing some stupid shit like this again\r",

        "content": "Early last month, I saw a video of a guy using a massage gun on his taint, and he seemed to enjoy it a lot, so I decided to try it for myself (I'm a guy too). I impulse bought a massage gun on Amazon and got it two days later. I opened that sucker up and gave it a go. It felt okay, but it was way better on my dick. I ended up using it again a couple more times over the next few days. \n\nAs the month went on, I noticed a strange feeling in my dick. It was a dull ache at the base of my penis, and it would come and go randomly. I thought nothing of it for a couple weeks, but then I started getting new sensations like shooting pain intermittently. When this month began, I felt the pain spread from my dick to my perineum, then to my glutes and down my right leg and foot. The sensations also became hot, tingly, cold, and even itchy. I knew something was definitely wrong at this point.\n\nWhat's worse is that the tingling sensations spread to my back, arms, neck, head, and even my lips. I promptly went to my doctor and learned I have pudendal neuralgia, which is irritation/damage to the pudendal nerve located in the pelvic and perineum region. I got referred to a PT and got some exercises to help increase my hip and leg flexibility which should help the nerve not be restricted by my muscles and heal faster, but the PT said it could take a full year before I'm better. They're also going to do an internal (read: rectal) check next time if I don't show much improvement to check that the damage wasn't affecting my sphincter muscles. So, while I'm anticipating that awkward exam, I gotta do multiple stretches every day while feeling like bugs are crawling on my skin and biting me, or like icy hot was applied to various parts of my body. I'm not religious, but I've been praying to God this past month cause I'm terrified this could be permanent.\n\nTL;DR: jerked off with a massage gun, got nerve damage and need PT to get better. 0/10, the orgasm was not fucking worth it.",
