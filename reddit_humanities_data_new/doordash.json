After ordering I waited 20 minutes and nobody had gone to get it. Once they finally assigned somebody he began sitting at his house on GPS for 15 min. On my way home I said fuck it and I drove to Jack in the Box, beat him there, picked up the order for my own name and canceled it while they handed over the bag. I know everyone still got paid but I thought it was funny lol ",

My order was the first thing it pushed at me. Got my 6 dollars back plus $4 because my order was sitting so long.",

But I had just dropped of an order, and was gonna make 2 50 for my drive back so I accepted.  Owner told me what happened,  no signal couldn't get thru to support.  So I just hit complete as I drove by his house without even slowing down.",

            "You canceled the order but everyone got paid? How does that work exactly?",
            "There was one time I saw the dasher sitting at a park for 30 minutes and I had gone on my lunch break  10 minutes into that 30 minute wait cause if they picked it up in 20 they should of been there with time for me to eat.  Well I clocked back in and they're still at the park.  I called support and told them about the wait and what I see and they're are all no they are at the restaurant.   I was like that's not what I see I'm already back from my lunch with nor eating I'd like too just get cancel and get my money back.  They said I can cancel but I won't get a refund.  I was like why,  they said policy they are there.  I said they aren't they never went to the location they drove  and went the opposite direction and parked at a local park.   They said no,  so I said well when am I supposed to get this I'm already back on the clock.  They said soon.   20 minutes later, so 1 hour 20 minutes all together they texted saying my driver is now so and so and is on his way to the restaurant.  I just laughed and was able to eat on the clock because I showed my boss everything and he was like fuck that app.  I haven't ordered since but that's the one weird order I've had,  usually it's 35 minutes.",

And she was skeptical. \n\nI drove to the tacobell this was 10PM I probably waited 20min after she had ordered it then I get the offer on my screen. The order came in at $10.50+ for 18mi on toll I took it. It ended up being $24.75 when I delivered it. My wife then told me she tipped $20 because she didn\u2019t want to have another driver drop it off and not have a tip. \n\nSo the order ended up being $24.75 for 16.5mi, I got \u201cpaid\u201d and got a trip home so no dead miles \ud83e\udd23\n\ninb4 pics or it didn\u2019t happen: I recently deleted a bunch of screenshots from DD and I deleted those screenshots so no pics \ud83d\ude2b",

Wish I could just swipe my phone and it would show up on their display or something.",
            "As someone on the other side (restaurant), I can say that the issue is not about Dashers stealing. It is not about giving you \u201corders\u201d. \n\nIt is that if a Dasher picks up an order and leaves without hitting that \u201cConfirm\u201d button, Doordash sends another Dasher to that restaurant to pick up that order. This becomes a big headache if the restaurant is busy. That Dasher gets mad at you because time is money for the Dasher. One time, a Dasher was mad at me and said \u201cCan you just re-make the order?\u201d Well. Remaking an order takes time. It gets stressful when the restaurant is busy and I have to put this order in front of all other orders. The restaurant can\u2019t just cancel the order. It has to call Doordash support. Doordash will tell you to re-make the order and will give money for the order picked up by the previous Dasher and the order you are told to re-make. But, while the restaurant is busy, you also have to spend a few minutes calling and talking to Doordash on the phone to explain the situation so that you can get compensated for the previous Dasher\u2019s mistake. \n\nDoordash knows that the previous Dasher was at the restaurant because that Dasher was assigned initially. Doordash support can see both Dashers assigned to this order. I do not know if there is any penalty. But, as someone on the other side of the situation, I see a lot of Dashers that are distracted (talking to someone on the phone or watching videos). Some of them forget to hit that confirm button (or maybe hitting a wrong button) and leave, causing this cascade of events for the restaurant and the next Dasher. That is why some restaurants are demanding like that. They will get the money, but they also waste time and get stressed.",
            "So? Just cause they asked u to press a button on your phone. You\u2019re worried about the wrong stuff.",

I\u2019m curious, what that 2.5 dollars is in terms of % of your total order? I\u2019m assuming it was pretty fkn low, and I can guarantee if your tip was around 15-20% your order would\u2019ve gotten there in a timely manner. also here\u2019s some advice, if your tip is going to be shit in the first place it\u2019s better you just go pick it up yourself and save some money/time.",

This is a voluntary exchange on all sides though.  I can opt out of the scam."

            "i\u2019m so sorry you went through this. that is completely unsafe and any of those people could\u2019ve hurt you (whether they\u2019re homeless or not). the most you can do is just avoid any mcdonald\u2019s orders that early in the morning or late at night, or bring someone with you when you\u2019re dashing that early or late. good idea to bring someone with you anyways since you\u2019re stopping at random houses and dropping off food, DD doesn\u2019t background check their customers so you could easily just deliver food to someone who just wanted a victim not a meal.",

            "I have yet to see a politician keep their promises of safety",

            "Idk i deal with a lot of homeless and low income people while doing rideshare and door dash. Its part of the job sadly. Its not always their fault they are homeless and if they dont talk to you just ignore them or buy mace/pepper spray",
            "I will say the 3 McDonald\u2019s closest to me all make me go inside to get the order",
            "Yeah people put razors on gas pumps not sure the motive though unless it was to make them defenseless to be roved idek. I have no clue why just that it was bad for awhile"

So, the merchant would proceed to charge the old card since the subscription wasn\u2019t stopped. It was already an authorized purchase, so it hits the old card first\u2026 then a few days later will post on the new card. Every subscription service you ever have you must make sure it is cancelled.

            "My pnc account has a service that let's me decline any charge if it will overdraft me for free. So there is something they can do even if not all do.\n\nEven so, predatory subscription practices are not universally allowed and are varied by state, states with the fewest consumer protections are where what you described can happen.\n\nEthically it is repugnant to use practices to get extra profit from people who you know are not utilizing your service or to trick people into paying for your service. I really don't like when people normalize it with \"well it's in the contract, you agreed to it\". Consumer protections are just understanding that if it is allowed, and every company does it, it makes it nearly impossible not to agree to that. At the very least point out that it is a shitty business practice and should not be shrugged off as normal capitalism.\n\nEdit: most likely doordash like many other sites will give you different functionality if you access it from an California IP (I always use a CA VPN for this reason, it is amazingly effective at making subscriptions easy to cancel so that might be something to try in situations like this, sometimes that unsubscribe button will just magically appear in plain view.)",
            "You are close, for most cases this would be true for like a gym or something, but without going too much I to the contract theory, they have to provide something in the contract in exchange for the payment, providing access to a gym or service usually fulfills this even if the customer didn't utilize the service. But if you delete the account then doordash isn't allowing access to a service so the consideration is no longer valid and most parts of the contract binding the customer are nullified.",

            "I used to work for a bank, we dealt with this a lot.  I did not work the dispute side of things but when I first started, I would warm transfer to inquire about the customers inquiries, the dispute department always pushed back stating the customer must make a good faith effort in reaching to the merchant to cancel their subscription. The subscription still stands. When the customer would call to claim their card was \u201clost\u201d anything that is marked as \u201creoccurring\u201d, allows the old account to still be charged from that merchant and will carry over to the new account. This is the same for accounts that are closed due to Fraud.  There isn\u2019t anything stopping the merchant from continuing their BAU aside from closing the bank/card account in whole. \n\nYou can disagree with me. That\u2019s fine, but I can only tell you what I have personally witnessed over the years.
