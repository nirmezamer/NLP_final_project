On one hand, the Yoon administration will certainly want to retaliate against Russia over the new pact with Pyongyang. South Korea has plenty of munitions and weapons systems that Ukraine would love to get its hands on.\n\nOn the other hand, the Yoon administration is unpopular and has limited political capital. The South Korean left is already representing this pact as proof that South Korea needs a non-aligned foreign policy, and the right may not want to give the opposition another issue to rally around. On top of that, the pact will only exacerbate the threat North Korea poses to the South, so the South will likely want to avoid significantly denting any of its stockpiles.",

In November 2023 Tehran announced that it would be getting Russian Su-35 fighter jets as well as Mi-28 attack helicopters. The deal was reported as finalized but apparently has not yet occurred. Iranian ballistic missile shipments to Russia, if confirmed, suggest that the fighter jets, helicopters, and perhaps even the S-400 missile defense system will be sent to Tehran soon.

A gaggle of Russian scientists were in North Korea prior to this month\u2019s military satellite launch. Kim has also been expressing satisfaction with his nuclear submarine plans, which is a very bad sign. This aspect of the relationship not only destabilizes security on the peninsula and in Asia; it also heightens the direct threat posed by North Korea to the homeland. ICBMs with advanced countermeasure technology, overhead reconnaissance capabilities, and nuclear submarines would allow Kim to target the entirety of the United States with a nuclear force that Washington would have difficulty taking out in a preemptive first strike. \n\n\nSeeing all these authoritarian regimes team up does not give me a good feeling.

            "A new bbc article giving some insight at mobilisation in ukraine https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz994d6vqe5o\n\nPretty interesting, mobilisation squads will roam around and try to corner people. Men thats within the draft age of 25-60 goes to hiding, avoids public grouping and if they have to go out and they got kids they'll walk with them so the mobilisation officers wont just snatch them. \n\n\n>With many of its soldiers dead, injured or exhausted, the Ukrainian government has stepped up its efforts to mobilise more men.\nA new law, introduced in May, requires every man aged between 25 and 60 to log their details on an electronic database so they can be called up. Conscription officers are on the hunt for those avoiding the register, pushing more men who do not want to serve into hiding.\n\n>The mobilisation squads have a fearsome reputation, especially in Odesa, for pulling people off buses and from train stations and ferrying them straight to enlistment centres.\nFor those avoiding the draft, public transport is now off limits. So too are restaurants, supermarkets, and weekend trips to the park to play football.\n\u201cI feel like I am in a prison,\u201d Maksym said.\n\n\n>At the enlistment centre around the corner, an optimistic note taped to the door notified would-be-recruits that those who had come voluntarily could skip the queues. But there were no queues. A lone man sat waiting to be seen.\nWhen I asked whether he was there out of choice, he told me he had been \u201ckidnapped\u201d that morning and brought against his will.\n\u201cThe officers encircled me so I couldn\u2019t run,\u201d he stuttered in shock. \u201cI\u2019m devastated.\"\nOne of the officers at the centre, Vlad, conceded that there were barely any willing volunteers these days. Under the call sign Hora, Vlad fought in some of the fiercest battles along the eastern front line in the Donbas before being struck in the head, chest, and legs by artillery shrapnel.\n\n\n>On the outskirts of Odesa, Vova appeared sheepishly at the door of his apartment block, using his seven-year-old daughter as a shield. The IT engineer will not leave the house without her as he knows the officers cannot snatch him if they are together.\n\n>Last year, while on his way to work, he was ordered off a bus by the military at gun point, he said, and taken to an enlistment centre. He convinced the officers to let him go to fetch some documents, but vowed to himself he would never return.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a military man, I\u2019ve never held a weapon, I don\u2019t think I can be useful on the front line,\u201d he said.\n\n\n>He then reeled off the same list of reasons given by every draft dodger we spoke to \u2013 a family to support, some minor medical ailment, and a defiant declaration he was sending humanitarian aid to soldiers.\n\n>But underneath these excuses is always the same fear, that within weeks of registering, these men would end up as cannon fodder on the front line that, to their eyes, does not appear to be moving. This is despite recent attempts by the government to give recruits some say over which units and roles they are assigned to.\n\nFor what its worth there has been instances when freshly recruited people with 1-2 weeks of training get thrown into the meatgrinder straight away, like these people that ended up in bakhmut less than a week after getting mobilised and getting taught how to fire a gun \n\n>The 16 men including Malkovskiy, enlisted into the 5th company of Ukraine\u2019s 93rd Mechanized Brigade, left Kharkiv on Feb. 16 by bus for the brigade\u2019s base 2\u00bd hours\u2019 drive south.\n\n>The passengers were mostly poor men from villages in the northeastern Kharkiv region, many of them unemployed, doing odd jobs as handymen or shift work at factories in the regional capital. Many had received mobilization notices that month, according to their military-service records. While some had completed mandatory service years or decades earlier, almost none had seen active combat.\n\n>They spent two nights at the base, where they were given Soviet-era rifles and uniforms, according to military documents and photos. On Feb. 18, they were driven to Kostyantynivka, 16 miles from Bakhmut, and billeted in a house on the outskirts of the garrison town.\n\n>On the morning of Feb. 21, the company sergeant major arrived to say he had orders to send the men into Bakhmut in groups of six. Russian forces were edging closer to the river that bisects the city, pressuring Ukrainian units defending themselves from constant mortar and artillery bombardment.\n\n>Some of the men threatened to write an official refusal to follow the order, citing a lack of training. Vladyslav Yudin, an ex-convict from the eastern city of Luhansk, said he told the sergeant major he had never held a gun, let alone shot one, and was scared. \u201cBakhmut will teach you,\u201d he said the man replied.\n\n>When the first group of men arrived in Bakhmut that evening, they were told to follow a commander to their position. They walked down alleyways past the ruins of bombarded buildings, stepping over downed telephone poles and unexploded Russian shells.\n\n>They reached a high-rise apartment block separated by a shed, a chain-link fence and a small garden from Russian troops in the next building. They took up positions beside windows on the first floor. Then they came under fire with grenades and mortars, and Yudin said he saw Serhiy Didik, a 36-year-old villager, and the commander killed in front of him. \u201cIt was hell on earth,\u201d he said.\n\nwsj is paywalled so someone copypasted the article in the comments here https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/13rfkaa/wsj_36_hours_in_bakhmut_one_units_desperate/ \n\nWhen you read stories like these i sympathize with people that have no will to fight deciding to flee the country.",

I\u2019m just saying that compared to taking a hot lump of shrapnel to the face, a simple concussive shock wave (in this particular scenario) is hardly a concern. \n\nIf you\u2019re close enough and it\u2019s the right kind of explosive, yeah, you can absolutely die from the concussive force alone. In this instance, they were not close enough and it\u2019s not a thermobaric warhead or something crazy like that. It also appears most of the explosion happened under the soil surface, which is great news for the soldiers. \n\nAn explosive shockwave loses energy exponentially from its source, which is the whole reason they make the thing fragment (and turn into shrapnel). Without shrapnel, you have to be ridiculously close to the explosion source to be mortally injured."
