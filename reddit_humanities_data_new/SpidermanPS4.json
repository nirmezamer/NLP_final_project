            "To those missing the NG+ (1.002.000) update, check your game for an update. \n\n- Go to the game on the Home Screen.\n- Press the options button\n- Click \"Check for Update\". \n\n1.002.000 should then start downloading. It will be a 3.576GB update and not the 600MB one (1.001.006).\n\nThe 1.001.006 update was released at the same time as this one, so people are receiving that one and thinking they don\u2019t have 1.002.000, but if you check for an update, then the NG+ update (1.002.000) should appear and start downloading.\n\n\u2014\n\n# Update: \n\nIf 1.002.000 doesn\u2019t appear, wait a couple of minutes, keep checking for an update or try restarting your console and see if that does anything to help. It seems to have worked for a few people. The servers are likely overloaded, hence the slightly out of sync release onto everyone\u2019s consoles.",
            "I've been playing for about 20 mins now and I noticed that the crimes are a bit more varied. Instead of the repetitive hordes of those monsters time after time, they actually changed it to more diverse ones with burglars and stuff.",

It wasn\u2019t a problem until til the flames have been lit mission where you have to steal the meat back from the hunters. No matter where I am I cannot web the meat. It\u2019ll flash the button input but only for a second. So I thought maybe it was just that save because this has never happened to me before. But now it\u2019s in every game save. Is there Any way to take this off? I tried the settings and button shortcuts and nothings working. I even re downloaded the game. Now I leave it up to the people here to help me out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hs884pm2vzoc1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c33b579a0ca6344e85fa6a357348971066acc6da",

            "Happy for NG+ but there goes my perfect 100% for this game by adding a new trophy\u2026",
            "Any way to use to the debug menu to 100% everything in NG+? I\u2019ve tried using the \u201cReload\u201d menu to skip to the endgame/epilogue, but when I do, it has all the main story missions completed, but all the side missions show as uncompleted, the level is set to 43, the suits (up to that point) are all available to purchase but not unlocked, and parts of the skill tree are incomplete (but can be purchased with the skill points available). \n\nI\u2019ve tried adding in branches that have side missions completed but those don\u2019t seem to work. I also tried the debug mission that claims to have everything unlocked, but it doesnt have the spider-bots or Photo Ops missions completed, and even though the rest of the side missions are completed, the suits from them are showing as locked. Additionally, this mission also sets you to Level 44, so some suits end up still being locked.\n\nAnd any other neat findings from these menus? I\u2019ve seen that in the load game debug screen you can play both the May 2023 Gameplay reveal section, the Kraven preview mission from last summer, and an unfinished city covered in symbiote that unlocks an unused phone call between Miles and Norman. I also now that people found both hints at the Beetle-themed DLC and some reused set pieces from the first game in the debug menus as well",
            "If you have the pre order bonus, it'll apply again when you start NG+ and let you use some of the NG+ suits early",
            "I\u2019ve been away from this game for a while and I\u2019m still only 70% through my original save file. I was going to get all the trophies but now there is a new one for completing NG+ does this mean I can no longer platinum the game without doing a second play through?",
            "I got the update, but I don't have the time of day option...",
            "So I know you can change tendril color post game now, but is there an option to change the color of Spidey's mech arms, or their web pits?",
            "Is it me or they added a water-y effect when you get wet?",
            "anybody else stuck on the peter and harry flashback mission in ng+? restarted my game and everything but i can\u2019t get past this one room",

            "I mightve missed it but did they add the ability to spawn a crime like in the miles game? It didn't look like it and im pretty bummed because I doubt we'll ever get that now.",
            "You know, the update is exactly what they said it was, and while a lot of it is still undercooked and more broken, people are hating on it a bit too much. My first impressions of it were extremely negative reading the reactions here until I actually reinstalled it. \n\nI'm not sure if anything has actually changed here since it's been a while, but it seems like there's new swinging animations to make the transitions between air tricks smoother. The graphics(not the water) have gotten a lot better too. The grind is nonexistent for the added content so it's a pretty nice update. Still very disappointing that it took them an extra 5 months and for it to release in the state it's in. \n\nAlso the added suits are all garbage",
            "I have an issue in ng+, Miles is unable to use his blue bio electricity as a finisher takedown even after the raft mission, is this a glitch or did they make the finisher super rare?",

            "If I replay a mission, what happens after I finish? It says progress will be lost but does that mean what I\u2019m doing now",
            "How do I change what suit appears during symbiote surge between the symbiote suit and the anti-venom? Right now it's doesn't change the suit at all but it does when I'm not in new game plus",
            "Anyone else got an issue with audio sounding weirdly muffled?",
            "They should've added a lot more than this if they hyped up for a update that adds so little. Cool, they fixed some stuff but they already should've have like Raimi Suit, especially after two other movie suits got fixed. It was only fair so no surprise there. But just hell gala suits? Nothing else that fans have been posting and sharing in this subreddit and other places?\n\nThey should've added at least a few more Suits that fans have been asking for.\n\nThey should've given more color options to Tendrils and not just lock us with same old Black and White. Especially after adding Red Symbiote Suit styles.\n\nWeather is missing, you can't control Weather in any time of day/night.\n\nGadgets are golden now. Cool, they add nothing like cool new bonuses. Pretty pointless.\n\nThe whole update shouldn't have took 5 months (minus the hacking incident) with so little things added in. I am honestly disappointed even though I was just waiting a NG+, settings that already should've been in Day One and some cool bonuses. They even released a separate trailer for NG+, a basic feature that should've been in Day one.\n\nAnd if they didn't really focused too much towards Accessibility settings they could've given more. I don't even remember when did I went in Accessibility settings. While yes, it is cool to have these settings minority of gamers will barely use it. I know many people here doesn't even use em.\n\nI really hope they get their fun sides going with upcoming DLC's, adding more stuff to make up to this disappointment.",

Now this whole leak situation with there entire road map out there, Like when Spider-Man PS4 released was so excited for the future of Spider-Man but honestly they just fumbled the ball since then.\u00a0",

For example, I platinumed the game a while ago, so when I look at the trophy list there are now two different sections. Spider-Man 2 trophies, which are all the trophies from the base game, and a New Game+ trophy section, which only contains the one trophy. So while I still have 100% trophy for Spider-Man 2, I have 0% in the NG+ section, bringing my overall trophy progress on a system level to 97%. It does not effect Platinum status at all though.

They should've given more color options to Tendrils and not just lock us with the old same Black and White. Especially after adding Red Symbiote Suit Styles.  \n  \nWeather is missing, you can't control Weather system.\n\nGadgets are golden now. Cool, they add nothing like cool new bonuses. Pretty pointless.\n\nThe whole update shouldn't have took 5 months (minus the hacking incident) with so little things added in.

So rather than listen to their fans' feedback and get rid of the pathetic missions, they double down and include them in the sequel too because they refused to accept that feedback, and cause they believed we were just all fucking stupid and we just misunderstood how to enjoy the MJ missions or something. Regardless, I've yet to see a reason for why they're still in the game that isn't what I just said. And they will do it again in the future games unless they get rid of Brian, since he seems to be the root of the issue with this.",

Miles looking through the debris of the city hall bombing is so impactful because we\u2019re in the shoes of the kid with no powers making his way through armed criminals out to kill.\n\nSometimes you need to be put in those kinds of situations to really understand how intense and dangerous everything else around you is.",

He\u2019s the one who would deliver the most emotion in that situation. \n\n> It's ridiculous because he has no powers at that time, and we have to believe he evaded armed criminals and later on Rhino during these moments.\n\nYeah that\u2019s not exactly that big of a \u201csuspension of disbelief\u201d moment. Like you\u2019re playing a game where a  spider bite gave a dude super powers, but you draw the line at a kid being able to evade armed thugs through debris? \n\n> This stuff you're talking about works in NON Superhero things. \n\nNo they work in superhero stories too. Just being a having powers isn\u2019t all what being a superhero is about, the people around that hero and how they go from civilians to heroes are what enhances stories to be better. \n\n> Otherwise, it's just asking the audience to believe and accept stupid scenarios. \n\nThe scenario you\u2019re playing of a guy being bit by a spider giving him power is already stupid and ridiculous to begin with. It\u2019s suspension of disbelief. And this applies to many other games as well. No amount of training can give the regular human Batman the capabilities to take down hoards and hoards of people in the Arkham games for example. \n\n> Why couldn't Pete get the medicine? \n\nBecause he was busy with the crime filled city and Miles was taking care of FEAST?? \n\nLike these are the questions you\u2019re asking? The basic ones answered and shown within the story itself? \n\n> Every single thing Miles or MJ does in both games, Pete could've done, and it would've made more sense. I don't wanna play as pre-bite Miles sneaking around as a civilain, and I don't want the game to justify it. I don't wanna play as MJ sneaking around military bases (fucking absurd lol) and breaking into Oscorp's penthouse.\n\nWell I and a plenty of other people do, in fact I think it makes the story far better and more engaging that way, giving perspective to scenarios you otherwise can\u2019t get as Spider-Man and allowing for more emotions and thrill to be explored. \n\n> I can't believe people are fine with NOT playing as Spider-Man in a Spider-Man game lol. They have to write the plot around being able to play as these characters, and it makes no sense.\n\nBecause people realize that Spider-Man isn\u2019t all that\u2019s about being Spider-Man. One of Peter\u2019s most defining traits as a character is the civilians around him and how Peter himself actively wants more time for his regular life. The usage of civilian characters can play great roles of setting up story elements and feeling the impact of each moment more due to the shift in perspective.\n\nJust because you may not prefer it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad lol.",
            "Well you play as Spider-Man for 98% of the game, so I'm not sure why you guys are obsessed with acting like there's only civilian sections from new game to credits. So dramatic, Jesus. It's one thing to hate the missions it's another to pretend like you don't ever play as Spider-Man. I just want the game to be way longer in general.",

Peter is overprotective given MJ\u2019s relative fragility and MJ is frustrated by \u2018only being the normal one\u2019.\n\nThen, SM2 kept elements of this narratively but he mission design kind of ruined it, by giving her too much of a power boost in response to the reception of SM1\u2019s MJ missions.\n\nI honestly think they should go all in on MJ being the audience stand-in. Narratively, further use her to convey the frustration, fear, and jealousy that would come from being a normal human surrounded by superheroes. From a gameplay perspective, use her to show just *how* big the power gap is between the heroes/villains & regular people.\n\nI\u2019d love to see MJ missions take more inspiration from horror games; having her complete tasks whilst sneaking around an enemy she can\u2019t fight/hurt (but would be low-mid level for Spider-Man). Cyberpunk 2077 had a mission like this, totally shifting the tone & gameplay and it was an awesome experience.\n\nA mission like this would convey that MJ is human and can\u2019t fight in Spider-Man\u2019s weight class but also that she\u2019s brave & capable, if somewhat reckless.",

            "Yeah, it's so weird. Spidey fans acks for something simple as \"What if Game MJ showed love an support for Spider-man?\"\n\nInstantly go on so weird rant, dehumanize MJ, the Fans, and say whatever insane thing that comes to mind. THey have no reason to be so unhedged",
            "Just my opinion after reading the comments, not that deep.",
            " such a crazy strawman lol. That's like there being a racist spider-man and you defend it by saying \u201cits a different adaptation. Why do you want it to be the same as the comics?\u201d",

            "There wasn\u2019t an argument. You brought up mixing custard and tuna. Which isn\u2019t the same like a woman being able to physically and emotionally support her partner. Which to be honest there is seafood custard recipes so again your argument isn\u2019t good. You just sound like you want the woman to be submissive and just there for eye candy.",
            "Morlun was yet another guy in a trench coat. His design was really boring and his plan wasn\u2019t special.\n\nSomehow all of MJ\u2019s fears were about how she was supposedly bothering Peter. She seemingly only existed to be his wife. Not impressed.\n\nThe Aunt May reveal was bad for similar reasons. (Ultimate Aunt May has yet to be matched.)\n\nMay was the exact opposite of a character. Her entire life revolved around Peter now.\n\nMJ and May were just luggage that Peter carried around now.",
            "Well she is not MJ to begin with. Has pretty much nothing personality wise that resembles her. Insomniac should have used Betty Brant or Nora Winters if they wanted this reporter character who was in for the story to begin with. So what exactly can I say they did right if they got the core of the character so wrong in the first place?\n\nIts the same problem with Insomniac's Hammerhead... he is not hammerhead, he is silvermane in all but looks. Also the tinkerer, though thats less of an issue considering he is a very noncharacter anyways.",
