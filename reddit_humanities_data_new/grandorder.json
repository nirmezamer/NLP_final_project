            "# FAQ\n\n**Q: When is the next SSR Ticket?**\n\n*A: As of its 6th Anniversary, NA now has a free SSR selector in Da Vinci's shop, which features*\u00a0[general pool and storylocked servants up to Europa](https://webview.fate-go.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/0703_6th_anniversary/info_3_nf2l3.png)\u00a0*(this will not be updated with more recent units). There is no time limit on this selector, and going forward, all accounts receive it upon clearing Fuyuki. No further SSR tickets have been announced to date.*\n\n**Q. Which banner do I choose for the GSSR? Which is best option?**\n\n*A: The answer is different for every player, and depends on many factors. We suggest you use the*\u00a0[GSSR Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dT7wE61H11dOaukY_INLuwtmFf5iyDdb8TXAKymttCY/copy)\u00a0*or*\u00a0[GSSR Advisor](https://fategc.com/gssr/details/anniversary-7)\u00a0*tools to rate servants based on your own criteria and see which banner/pool is statistically better. If you have tried these tools and are still uncertain, you can ask for advice in the thread.*\n\n**Q: What is happening to reruns? Which event will get a rerun in the future?**\n\n*A: As far as we know, most events will not be getting reruns. The only exceptions are Karnamas (NA ETA: Dec 2024), Summer 6 (May 2026) and Lilim Harlot (June 2026).*\n\n**Q: Will welfare servant X be obtainable in the future?**\n\n*A: Yes, JP has introduced a new Evocation system which allows players to get selected welfares which can be view on the* [*Fandom wiki*](https://fategrandorder.fandom.com/wiki/Evocation_Festival)*.*",

Is there supposed to be some sort of event or challenge that he's preferred on right now? Or do I just have someone on my list that really likes using him?",
            "Just to confirm - there is no way to miss out on anything by just following some random path in Ooku maze, right? I.e. you can always come back and explore the labyrinth in full.",

            "Is the method to use a single account in multiple devices copying files from the Android/Data folder no longer working? I got a new tablet and can't seem to be able to set it up for some reason. Despite still having access in my phone and old tablet.\n\nEDIT: \n\nManaged to solve the issue. For some reason the FGO data folder was visible but NOT modifiable from a PC when connecting the device via usb, despite this being possible before. Maybe it was a change to Android 14 I was not aware of. \n\nThe \"fix\" was to open **two** instancesof the default google \"Files\" app and put them side and side, from which it was possible to **drag** the files into the data folder. Copying was not possible.",
            "How long do I have before events need Lostbelt 6 completion? Cernunnos is rough, and I'm gonna need time to build my Sanzang and Lobo and also get some of those blue cubes.",
            "What was the message that pop up notification had? (8PM for me) I accidentally clicked on it and only read limited time mission. \n\nAlso, do you guys think that NA\u2019s release of the Ooku interlude will still follow JP\u2019s schedule? I just assumed that we\u2019d get a heads up of the release and if we\u2019re following JP\u2019s release then it should be releasing today, or 15 days into Bakin\u2019s event.",
            "After the last update on JP I'm getting a black screen when I boot up the game. There's sparkles when I touch the screen but I don't think anything is loading there. Anyone else has the same problem? Is there any solutions?",

            "So, I'd like some advice on Tamamo Cat. (I know what you're about to read is stupid and likely unfeasible, but I genuinely would love to have a Tamamo only account, just to flaunt to my friends how much of a simp I am lol)\n\nShe's literally the ONLY damage dealer my account will have until next year when Lancer Tamamo gets a rate up (and maybe Koyanskayas of Light + Dark later). I want to make a fox-only account (I'm already in the 3rd singularity in this alt) and I quickly realized that as adorable as Tamamo Cat may be...\n\nShe's kinda bad. At least, without the proper supports I definitely won't have. Is it feasible to progress in this game, even IF i manage to 120 max append all of the tamamos + koyanskayas? I'd feel terrible putting so much effort in this silly niche alt account only to realize I physically can't beat >!Tiamat!< or >!Goetia!< later on.\n\nIn my main account, I mostly farm with double KoyanDark + Light (with append 2 maxed, the three can farm with their NPs while leaving free slots for CEs in events and such), so I know farming won't be a problem once I obtain them, but my biggest fear are bosses.",
            "For the lore people out there, can someone elaborate on the \"child servant\" tag? \nI've been browsing Van Gogh's profile on the wiki and stumbled over it. It was kinda surprising since Gogh looked like a young woman to me (typical Nymph), but thought okay, maybe the artstyle just gave me a different impression. \nI kept browsing the child servant tag because now I was curious, and while most servants in that section immedietely made sense, visually, others absolutely do not. For example Kyohime or Asterios (!).\nSo what is the idea here? Can a servant get the child tag if their mind is that of a child, even in the body of an adult? And vice versa, see Andersen?",

For example I'm in the 6th singularity (Camelot) and there's a lot of combinations of Saber + Lancer waves and I find myself struggling to even beat the non-Boss including chapters. Do I just bring a bunch of servants who are neutral? When I try to bring the enemies weakness, it'll quickly die to the opposing enemy type. If I bring too many supports (such as my Waver, Mozart, Hans) for my own DPS then sometimes I get these awkward face cards and can't seem to chain properly. Plz help ;-;",
            "Regarding the three upcoming 5-star Summer Servants in NA (namely: Ibuki, Skadi, and Avalon), which of them would be the most/least useful depending on a given player's roster (i.e. if a player has a Castoria/OG Skadi, or if they have mainly Quick or Arts DPS)?",

            "What are your thoughts on grailing Habbycat?\n\nSo I am doing the 90+ node for Hakkenden running Habatrot, Meltryllis, and 2x Skadi. Its an easy set up. Habatrot clears wave 1 alone; Meltryllis clears wave 2 with a 50% CE, full mana loading, and 2x Skadi quick buffs; then Meltryllis clears wave 3 when the Skadis give their 50% NP to her.\n\nExcept ... that isn't what happens. Habatrot can't clear wave 1 alone despite having the type advantage on the mobs along with NP5 and rank 10 arts buff. Like I just assumed she would clear that alone just at a glance, but she only does maybe 150k (iirc, out of AP to check) for the wave and all three mobs are just barely alive. I have to add in a Skadi rank 10 Def Down which ups the damage to 235k which is enough to clear all the mobs easily. Thankfully I don't actually need that second Def Down for waves 2 or 3 so it isn't an issue, but still.\n\nThe issue really is more I am using the silver currency CE and not something that has some arts or damage up. I could probably switch to the gold currency CE and that would probably push me over the threshold.\n\nBut it got me thinking. What about later? What about those times when I am in a lotto and trying to 6CE, or another event like Hakkenden that doesn't have a damage CE, or going up against a wave 1 where I don't have type advantage ... that 80% battery is very nice. \n\nSo how to you guys feel about grailing her? Think she is fine at 80? Obviously more levels would be better, but do you think 90, 100, or 120 would be the intersection point between efficiency and resources? Think it is worth it? Truthfully I have a fairly robust account so finding someone to clear early waves wouldn't be that difficult, \n\nWould it be better to throw grails into Arash or Gong instead?",

It only matters as far as it helps achieve these things, not as a goal in of itself)\n\n\nTeams are fight dependent. The more you switch up your team and the more options available, the easier time you will have, both in harder content and in farming.\n\n\nuse class advantage and NP targeting where possible (there are places and reasons to break this rule, and sometimes figuring out the correct one can be difficult if there are multiple classes, or are 2 enemies, or are farming and the number of enemies changes each wave, but until you have experience with teambuilding, this is good to follow)\n\n\ncounter gimmicks (if the boss has a ton of debuffs, or one really annoying one, bring a servant that clears debuffs, if the boss removes buffs bring buff removal resistance, if the boss has pierce invul, bring a servant with stuns, or guts or defense up to counter that)\n\n\ncounter niches (if the boss is Male, bring someone with bonus damage against Males, if they are Earth attribute bring someone with bonus damage against Earth attribute enemies)\n\n\nHave a gameplan. (Don't just have your frontline and 3 random DPS servants in the back. Consider what you are going to do at each step of the fight. Who on the frontline will die first, who replaces them, when will you use certain skills)",
            "All of the Arts teams. Literally all of the Arts teams. Any servant with a damaging Arts NP gets a huge offensive boost from Castoria. For general purposes, just pick a DPS or two that's appropriate for the fight, throw on Castoria, and you're good to go. Borrow a friend's Castoria as a second support for even more NP charge and damage.\n\n\nHowever, IMO, thinking in terms of \"card type teams\" isn't useful. Pick your DPS servant(s) then pick the supports that will help them do their job in the fight. Card type is good, but not always important to consider when choosing your DPS and supports. For example, for example, I might decide that Okita, with her defense ignoring NP, is the right servant for a tough boss fight. But to keep the team alive, I might pick Merlin and Castoria as supports, neither of whom has a Quick buff, for their ability to keep the team alive.\u00a0\n\n\nYour CE selection will really depend on the fight. For general purposes, it doesn't matter that much. Any CE with starting NP charge or that helps with the servant's main role in the fight, and ideally both, will be fine. In more difficult fights or fights with heavier gimmicks, you might pick CEs that help counter the gimmicks.",

            "Honestly, she does a good job just fine ungrailed. Grails will not have a huge effect, it's just a small stat increase, and if you do want to grail her for gameplay I highly suggest doing your own calculations. Otherwise, if it's not worth the effort to research, it probably isn't worth the effort to grail.\n\nI'd rather use my grails on my favourites, and besides, Habetrot can't do everything - no unit can. Sometimes it's just easier/quicker to find someone else to do it.",
            ">do you think 90, 100, or 120 would be the intersection point between efficiency and resources? Think it is worth it? Truthfully I have a fairly robust account so finding someone to clear early waves wouldn't be that difficult,\n\nI think level 80 for Habetrot is the intersection point between efficiency and resources. I suggest looking into solutions that don't require grails.  Quests like this are designed to disrupt easy min-turn comps.  Don't forget that taking an extra turn or three is an option as well.  Try knocking down the HP on some of the first wave's mobs before you use your NP and switch into high-efficiency mode.\n\nGrails are rare, limited, don't provide much benefit relative to the cost, and their use is permanent. Servants you use for their gameplay value but otherwise don't care much about them are subject to change. You may find such a servant sidelined later if you decide to pursue different strategies or there's a game update that makes the strategy less effective.  However, your favorites, when you like them for reasons other than their gameplay value, will be more durable. Being your favorites, you are probably more likely to find ways to use them, ensuring that you get the additional value when you use them. And even if the extra levels from grails don't make a significant impact, it will still feel good when they hit a little harder or are just a bit more durable.\n\nIf you use grails purely for gameplay, which I actively recommend against, don't just throw the grails on and hope they make a difference. Figure out the exact free quests and team compositions where you want to use them. Do the math to determine if the servant needs more stats to clear the quest consistently and if the stats from the grails you plan to use will be enough. Laplace in the Chaldea app is a great tool for testing your team comps. Verify that you don't already have another option, using a different servant, team comp, or strategy that you find satisfactory.",

At the very least, you should absolutely spend your regen AP on them over free quests, and if you find yourself needing a lot of materials still, spending apples on them on top is worthwhile too if you have the time to farm (every HQ is available for one day only typically).",

There are some [servant coin calculators](https://r-grandorder.github.io/fgo-guides/references/coins_calculator.html) you can find that can show you the calculations. If you're planning to get all 32+ copies on one banner, I hope you have at least a couple thousand SQ saved. You'll need about 2,160 SQ, or the equivalent in tickets, for a 50% chance of getting at least 32 copies.\u00a0\n\n\nTechnically, your best bet would be a class-based banner because the normal 40% 3-star rate would only be shared between Salieri and Xu Fu, giving a 20% chance per roll. However, it has been more than two years since they last did a class based summoning campaign and there's no way to know when or even if they'll ever do it again.\u00a0",

His damage takes a hit when he's out of niche, but in niche his damage is stupid. Plus, he recently got an upgrade that gives him more damage on his NP, as well as another damage niche, Man/Human attribute. That covers about 1/3 of all servants in the game, so if he can double dip, even better. Even at NP3, assuming his anti-Humanoid skill is up, he's going to blow other low rarity Assassins out of the water. When it's not up, his damage does drop, but he's still got a great kit and good NP spam and crit potential.\n\n~~The only downside is oh boy he loves those bronze mats, off to the pure prism shop you go.~~",

            "A lotto, or lottery, is a type of event. How they basically work is that you farm free quests for lotto ticket items (they drop alongside the usual event shop currencies), and those \"lotto tickets\" are used to obtain additional items via another tab in the event shop.\n\nThe way it works is that you are given a \"box\" containing a fixed set of items. You pay lotto tickets to take items out of the box, and eventually, you are guaranteed to empty it and get everything out. Then, you reset the box to get a new box of items, farm for more tickets, and repeat. These boxes can be reset infinitely, meaning you can farm items as much as you want while the shop is up!\n\nThe items inside the boxes are varied, but include ascension materials, skill gems, EXP cards, QP, FP, apples and mana prisms. Because you are getting all of those things at once, AND because you can infinitely farm them, is what makes lottos so good, because they are lucrative.\n\n(There can also be some other elements to the event, such as challenge quests, but those are unique to each event.)\n\nThe next lotto event NA is due to get will be the Tam Lin, or Faerie Knight Cup (aka \"Morganfest\") in November - we don't know its official NA name yet! You only need to have cleared Fuyuki to farm the free quests and play the lotto, but the event's main story will require LB6 clear (though not accessing it isn't a HUGE deal).",

Each lottery box has skill/ascension materials, EXP, MP, FP, and QP. They aren't necessarily more efficient for more efficient for each of those things individually but they are more efficient when taking the bundle as a whole. [Here](https://gamepress.gg/grandorder/battle-new-york-2024-event-lottery#topic-1620526) is an example of the available items.\n\n\nLottery events happen twice per year. They used to be reliably sometime in September and for the Christmas event but they've changed things up in recent years. NA's next lottery event is expected in November. There won't be a new Christmas event this year. Instead, we're getting a rerun of the Christmas event from two years ago (with a limited lottery, so no infinite grinding).\u00a0",

Some are useful for specific play styles - like if you bring in taunters for a solo unit, there are CEs like battle of Camlann that give np charge to the party on death.\n\nBut then there are a lot of them that won't really help that much - charm success rate up, death success rate up, small debuff resistance, low % buffs etc.\n\nUsually I really like starting np charge ce's. eg mlb dragon meridian - 50% starting charge - if Kama's S3 is max (or with append skill) you can easily np on turn 1\n\nAtk Buff or color buff CEs are super useful too - arts up or quick up or buster up depending on who you put the ce on, np damage up helps if you put it on someone with a damaging np etc.\n\nAs you level up, your max party cost goes up to 114. So you will usually get used to bringing CEs in your team (mostly end game players will focus on stuff like bond ces)\n\nNote - during events when farming it is highly recommended to bring in as many relevant event ces.

            "\"Best way to build up an account\" is ultimately subjective. Some people will say you should save every scrap of SQ for a banner with an SSR that you really really want because the odds of getting that SSR are so poor. They're right in the fact that if you really want an SSR, the more SQ the better, but you *will* be paying the opportunity cost of building your account more slowly. \n\nI went the route of saving some SQ and rolling some SQ, and while it took me much longer to get some of my favorite SSRs (and some elude me to this day), my account was up and running more quickly because the random 3\\*s and 4\\*s started piling up faster. This is probably not the route you want to take if there is an SSR you really really want, because it'll reduce your odds of getting them, but I can attest that it certainly worked for giving me a solid roster faster.\n\nFor your free SSR pick, Tamamo is a good selection if you really like her and you want her around. Nothing beats having a favorite. Gameplay-wise, she will do less to immediately impact your ability to clear stuff; she'll make Zenobia hit harder, for instance, but she doesn't do a lot for day-to-day play when you're using Buster or Quick-focused damage-dealers. \n\nUltimately, the main thing that helps you get through FGO is patience. If you want to save, you have to be patient as you rely on the FP pool to slowly build your roster. If you spend more freely, you have to be patient as it'll be longer before you get your favorite SSRs (unless you get lucky). If you snag a favorite who's not great at farming with your SSR ticket, you have to be patient as your farming teams won't come together quite as quickly. But the game isn't pay-to-win, and with time you'll hit the goals you need to.",
            ">What's the best way to build up my account early game?\n\n\nFirst, don't worry about the state of your account early in the game. You won't have a lot of servants early on and you won't have the resources to invest in them as much as you might like. They've added ways to help new players catch up a little faster but in general, I think it's going to feel slower than you might be used to in other games. And while I will provide some optimization tips below, you can't mess up your account merely by doing things sub-optimally. At worst, you'll just have to do some grinding earlier than you might have otherwise.\u00a0\n\n\nGacha strategy is also something to figure out in the long term. Figure out what works best for you. You don't have to use some YouTuber or redditor's strategy just because they tell you to. I personally don't save much more than 300 SQ for any banner because there are a lot of servants I want and I'm willing to accept the chance of failure if it also means I have a chance to get all of them. Some people only want a few specific servants and are willing to save everything to guarantee they'll get them. Some people spend a little SQ on most banners for maximum variety. There's no right or wrong approach and you don't need to have it figured out right away.\u00a0I was pretty new to gacha games when I started and didn't have a coherent strategy for over a year. Throwing SQ around at random worked out fine for a while. I got serious about saving and planning after getting the first 5-star that I specifically wanted and rolled for.\n\n\nAs for building up the servants you already have, level up one servant at a time in each of the seven main classes with the goal of having one servant with a single target NP and one with an AOE NP in each class at their natural max level. You want to focus on one servant at a time because a fully leveled servant is going to be more valuable than a handful of under-leveled servants. It doesn't matter much which specific servants you choose, including low rarity servants, so go with whoever seems most appealing to you. Just about any servant within a given class and NP targeting niche will get the job done for general purposes.\n\n\n**Don't neglect lower rarity servants.** Some of them are among the best servants in the game within their role regardless of rarity. The devs also test all content to ensure that it can be cleared using only free, low rarity servants. The higher base stats on higher rarity servants might let you brute force some situations but they won't save you from a fundamentally bad strategy. What low rarities lack in base stats, they can make up for in the ease of getting more copies for NP levels or in unique utility that lets them punch (or block, as the case may be) above their weight, even surpassing 5-stars at times. They also take fewer resources to build up and they take up less team cost in your party. Team cost may be especially important for low level accounts because it gives you more flexibility for CEs and other servants.",
            "Yes, as a new player you should be spending all the FP you get to build up your low-star roster (and get some embers etc on the side). No future use for FP is worth more than that.",
            "A lot of people don't want second, third, fourth, etc copies of specific servants or don't want certain servants. For you early game when you have no one any 4-5 star can help at least to some extent. So for newbies I don't think rolling the story banner and just being happy getting whatever is that bad unless you have some specific servant you really love and want to get. But that's just my philophy. This is why people will mock the story banner and say it's pointless but it's just from that perspective it doesn't necessarily apply to you. \n\nFYI in the FTP gatcha getting a 3 star is low odds but you'll get eventually because you just keep rolling, it's similar odds to a 5 star. But getting 3 star servants or ces in the saint quarts gatcha is the highest odds thing so there's that.\n\nImo Mash, Euryale, Hans, Saint George, Leonidas, Lancer Cu (from FSN), David, Spartarcus, Arash, Ushi, Mandricardo, Asterioas, Hundred Personas should be the most broadly useful FTP servants super early on.",
            "In this help post, on the VIP links, there's a spreadsheet for \"upcoming banners by servant\" and yes, Emiya does have an upcoming rate up.

            "The story banner is not worth rolling on as he is not on rateup. Instead, it's better to wait for his rateup on a future banner.\n\n\nAs other have said, you can also get him for free during certain campaigns. Next year in September you will be able to get him for free on a free SR ticket, and also, we are expecting a Fate/Stay Night themed selector at some point where he is an option.",
            "Are you talking about Emiya Alter in particular? Or just plain ol' OG Stay Night Emiya? (They're both 4* Archers, after all)\n\nIf it's the former, you'd be right that he's only available from the Story Summon (being a Story-Locked Servant), and apart from his next campaign, you'll only be able to get him here.\n\nIf it's the latter though, the OG Archer Emiya can actually be pulled on almost every banner (except FP Summon), being a permanent pool 4* Archer. So, although the chance is low, you always have that very low chance to obtain him.\n\nIf you really want Emiya, perhaps you could wait for the Fate/stay night Anniversary ticket that we'll get in the future? Although the only SSR (Artoria) would be the most worth it pick, it won't be a waste to pick Emiya instead if you really want him.\n\nThe only issue is that we don't know when that ticket will drop. It can drop within the year to celebrate the Steam release of Fate/stay night, but it could also drop in 1.5 years when it actually did on JP.",

Up to you whether you consider that worthwhile to keep attempting.

            "Here's a handy dandy timeline of important stuff:\n\n* May 2022: Requiem collab introduces the first 90+ farming nodes to events. These are nodes with a non-3/3/x structure, and are harder for many refund-based loopers to do without additional support. While some loopers can handle them, multicore setups (setups with more than one DPS servant) are usually a much more accessible way of handling them, and are equally efficient.\n* May/June: NA gets Servant Coins a year earlier than expected. Coins are given per copy of a summoned servant (with 4-5\\*s being given copy-based coins retroactively, 1-3\\*s don't) and per bond level (everyone gets this retroactively. Append skills are brought into the game (with most units only having one impactful append, and NP1 SSRs being able to unlock an append at Bond 6, so it's not really a P2W thing), as is the ability to grail to lv. 120. Any welfares released/rerun before 6th Anniversary don't have easy access to their coins (as they do not get copy-based coins, only for bond), and are temporarily screwed over.\n* July: 5th Anni introduces Castoria, an incredibly powerful Arts support that takes Arts looping to a whole new level, as well as providing some of the best challenge quest support out there for any card type.\n* October: A whole bunch of QOL updates are ported over from JP, including high quality (\"60 fps\") battle mode, being able to set 3 different support lists for normal and event.\n* November: With the release of LB5.5, NA gets pity much earlier than expected (JP got pity in Jan 2022, so there was only a 10 month gap).\n* July 2023: 6th Anni introduces Koyanskaya of Light, a Buster support that allows Buster units to 3-turn loop farm by lowering cooldowns on skills, enabling units to use battery skills twice. While unlike Arts and Quick, Buster is not refund-based (meaning it doesn't care about enemy counts per wave!), many Buster units require a starting charge of some sort.\n* Later in the month, Oberon is released. Oberon is the game's first Pretender class, and the first 70% support, though his skills come with major caveats and require careful usage. Though he leans Buster (and inevitably found a home with Koyan of Light by his side), he can be used by any card type due to his NP damage buff and the ability to double the value of NP damage buffs. He is primarily used as a min-turn support due to the drawbacks on his skills, because if the enemy is dead the drawbacks don't matter.\n* Jan 2024: Starting with the Case Files rerun, most events are now 3 weeks long (exceptions being this year's Valentines and Chaldea Boys, plus lotto events). There is also a significant cut down on reruns: see pinned comment for a rundown of which events get reruns from now on.\n* Throughout 2024: Several other old events are brought back as Main Interludes, and existing Main Interludes are made free upon clearing certain story chapters.\n\nThere are a couple more things you may want to be aware of for the future:\n\n* 7th Anni coming up in a few weeks will bring in a few changes, including a reform to Quick cards and the introduction of Mighty Chains.\n* The new summer event will introduce 90++ nodes to the game. These are farming nodes with incredibly high HP, and are more challenging to clear, but 90+ is still available so there isn't exactly any pressure to do them, if you don't want to.\n* Starting next year in spring, we will be getting the Evocation Festival, or a series of campaigns that put old welfare servants into a permanently available shop (along with their servant coins). See the pinned comment/Fandom wiki for a list of servants brought back so far.\n\nThat's all the really major stuff I can think of, there's probably other things but this is just the most important.",

            "I'll offer not a disagreement, really, but a counter-argument regarding the story banner. If it were a purely binary choice, I would definitely say no, don't roll on the story banner. But when you're new and don't have a lot of servants is arguably the best time to roll on the story banner because that's when you have the best chance of getting servants you don't already have. And if you don't have any particular servants you want to save for, roster diversity is probably the next best thing to aim for. However, I would recommend that\u00a0don't go too hard on the story banner, or any other, because most of the servants on the story banner can spook you on limited banners and\u00a0you will probably want to save for specific servants eventually. And you could just as easily spend that bit of SQ or tickets on any banner that catches your attention where you could get a unique servant that has limited availability. There will be a time when there's no value at all in rolling on the story banner but that time isn't necessarily today.\u00a0",
            "I wouldn't go for the story banner personally as there is no rateup and it's a really lucky dip of who you get. Personally, I'd save your tickets and such because you never know who you might be interested in, especially as FGO is a story-driven game and someone is bound to win you over. (That, and if you're into waifus in bikinis, there's a summer event coming up... but I digress.)\n\nUse your FP, absolutely. The FP pool contains many staple units and you want to get your niches filled out - plus, low rarity units are cheaper to raise in terms of resources and have a low party cost, so you can fit them into your party.",
            "Good Servants that you have? \n\n- Spartacus is a hidden gem: a cheap AoE Berserker with a battery, so it's easier for him to get his NP off faster. As you get better starting NP charge CEs and build him up, he becomes a cheap and easy way to take out a wave of enemies. Tamamo Cat is also pretty darn decent, she just needs more help building her NP charge.\n\n- Caesar is a surprisingly good ST Saber. If you prefer to raise Diarmuid, that's also fine, but Caesar is quite talented on a budget.\n\n- Robin Hood will be useful in boss fights. (Also, keep an eye out for Euryale, another good 3\\* ST Archer who clowns on many male bosses.) If he can poison an enemy and use his NP, he does surprisingly great damage. And he's Arts, so he pairs well with Tamamo if you get her. Zenobia is a quite good AoE Archer, and is also Arts for good Tamamo synergy. \n\n- Of your Lancers, none are total standout damage dealers. But Leonidas can be useful as a sacrificial tank to draw hits away from your more valuable characters as you work on building NP charge and whittling down enemies.\n\n- Mandricardo is your standout Rider. Good all around, just be aware that one of his skills will kill him. \n\n- Cu Caster can be pretty good, he's just held back by his storylock status, meaning that it'll be hard to increase his NP damage with additional copies.\n\n- Jing Ke is probably your best Assassin at the moment. I would keep an eye out for Hassan of the Hundred Personas and Fuuma Kotaro, both 3\\* Assassins who are arguably the best 1-3\\*s at ST and AoE damage respectively.\n\n- Sadly, your lone Avenger is deliberately bad. I wouldn't prioritize raising him until you're swimming in the mats and XP you need.\n\nAs for the story banner: I'm not as against it as most people are. When you're just starting out, there are a ton of Servants in it that you don't have, so there's a low chance that you'll get someone you already have and a high chance you'll get someone new. It's pure gambling: you don't know who you'll get, but if you just want fresh bodies, it can be fun.\n\nThat said, one main reason to put tickets into other banners is the existence of limited characters. For example, the current banners feature limited characters who are impossible to get outside of specific banners featuring them: Super Orion, Bakin, Okada Izo. So a lot of folks prefer to focus on those banners and the rare opportunities they provide. But there are more limited Servants than you can feasibly roll for, so don't feel like you have to roll for limited Servants just because they're around. If you can say \"hm, I'm not that interested in this banner\" and skip it, great! That's a discipline that will be useful as long as you play the game.",

            "Hmm I think I'll go for Tamamo-no-Mae for the 5 star, part of me wants to wait until I roll on banners so she might spook me, but then again those odds are extremely low and other servants don't really stand out to me yet (tho that might change due to story), so I don't really have a limited banner to look forward to. \n\nI am partial to the Fate S/N servants though.

If Chen Gong has Overcharge AND there are enemies left after his regular NP, the remaining ones get hit for whatever OC specifies.

You click on him while you're playing him or click on his character in your Chaldea and it should say something like deals extra damage to one poisoned enemy (scales with overcharge). Different servants have different effects on their NP that scale with overcharge.\n\nIf you go down to his wiki and look at his NP you'll his extra damage to poisoned enemies being 200% and scaling up to 250% which is a lot and is super effective damage.\n\n[https://fategrandorder.fandom.com/wiki/Robin\\_Hood](https://fategrandorder.fandom.com/wiki/Robin_Hood)\n\nWhat that means is basically it's really good because the same buffs stack additionally with each other and different buffs stack multiplicatively with each other. So basically it's really good because super effective damage stacks multiplicity which is more than stacking things additively. This video probably explains it better.\n\n[https://fategrandorder.fandom.com/wiki/Robin\\_Hood](https://fategrandorder.fandom.com/wiki/Robin_Hood)\n\nThat CE you listed will give a lot more damage for one turn because it's one turn of overcharge. Alternatively if you get him to 200 NP gauge for some reason that will work for the purpose of this too. If you doesn't have a CE that gives like 3 turns of overcharge or something like that I'd probably dismiss the idea of using a CE. What CE you use probably depends on the supports you use for him and how quickly they give charge, how quickly you have to end the fight, how much defence and healing you've got. If you want to end a fight earlier because you keep getting killed quickly try a 50% CE. If you're fine with taking your time the 25% arts up with no charge is fine.\n\nAlso level his 1st skill because it's a 5 turns of poising the enemy on 5 turn cool down. So assuming it lands when the poison goes away you can just put it straight back on.",

But Jeanne's NP stun lasts for 2 whole turns (Jeanne's phase turn 26 after NP, your phase turn 27, Jeanne's phase turn 27, your phase turn 28) so the little icon remained there until the start of *her* phase on turn 28.\n\nKinda like how if you use an attack buff and a defense buff at the same time the attack buff will wear off after you attack but the defense buff will remain until the end of the enemy's attack phase even if both have the same turn duration.",

            "I can't believe he unintentionally cucked himself with this move lmao.\n\n\n\nUpdate: He ended up using 600ish Sqs when I uploaded this and still nothing.",

            "This is a reminder of how my friends did their gssrs.\n\n1 wanted Arjuna Alter, 1 wanted well\u2026 there was a bunch of options, I forget who he was aiming for. (I think it was Himiko, Melusine and Summer Kiara or Abby)\n\nThey each used my thighs as catalysts, resting their phones on 1 each.\n\nThey both got\u2026 well, not exactly who they were looking for. The friend who wanted Arjuna Alter, got Kama (right thigh). The friend who had a bunch of people on his lineup, got Douman (left thigh).\n\nNow my friends literally use my lap as a catalyst. I hate it.\n\nThe Kama one made sense, since Kama actually loves me a lot, and I love her in turn. (FGO wife) it still hurt to see on someone else\u2019s phone. But it\u2019s funny because she can sense my presence, even on someone else\u2019s phone.\n\nI just like to make fun of Douman one because my lap is Kama\u2019s territory, so he needs to stop lying down there. Get away from there bro, it\u2019s a bit freaky lol\n\nThe kicker though, is this friend who wanted Arjuna Alter, REALLY wants Douman, and among the friend group, is the only one missing him.",
