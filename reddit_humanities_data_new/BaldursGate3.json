And now going to take a much much needed break from this game after like 800 hours lol\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you thank you thank you to everyone on this sub who has answered my dozens of questions day in and day out!!",
            "So all my runs are fully switched over to Tactician difficulty, and my first character to beat the game was a Tactician run start to finish. I greatly enjoy challenging gameplay and will probably try out Honour Mode for my final playthrough. \n\nI\u2019m sort\u2019ve reflecting on where I\u2019d like to go from here with the game and what builds I\u2019d like to try, and I feel like I keep thinking that the most effective strategy in nearly every encounter is just \u201calways just do damage.\u201d\n\nI mean sounds kind of obvious, but what I mean is whenever I play a Paladin there\u2019s almost never a turn I bother using any other ability or spell other than a smite. Even on my Oathbreaker I hardly see a reason to use the Oath charges, even the AoE fear is usually resisted enough that a more economical use of my action would\u2019ve just been to swing my sword and put a Smite on it. When all of these other actions may easily fail and aren\u2019t always even that effective, why take the risk when you can have relatively guaranteed big damage? This applies in more ways than just a Paladin which is just an obvious example. \n\nMy Draconic Bloodline Sorc who I built to make use of Careful meta magic control spells basically just uses the frost Cantrip into a second because the Necklace of Elemental Aug is so centralizing and powerful. Added a Mourning Frost and I basically just blast Cantrips all day, like an icy Lock (speaking of Cantrips). \n\nI guess what I\u2019m saying is that I feel like the best use of action economy is almost always just going for what\u2019s going to do reliable single target damage, and in some cases AoE. Maybe this is more noticeable on Tactician where you get punished harder if you\u2019re not taking mobs out quickly, paradoxically maybe I\u2019d find this less of an issue on an easier difficulty where I can more or less start doing other things than all out assaulting on every turn. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever bothered with any Charm spells, slow, fear, polymorph, half or more of the difficulty terrain spells just aren\u2019t necessary and inconvenience you just as much (Evards, good IMO only in very limited circumstances). When I do want a control spell, either Hold Person or Banish (with the occasional niche usage for Command) just seems so much consistently better than anything else. I just feel like I keep going back to \u201cblast blast blast\u201d on every turn because it nearly always feels like  anything else in most cases is potentially wasting an action, and I think it\u2019s making the gameplay feel smaller than it is. \n\nAbsolute masterpiece of a game and this is at best a nitpick from someone with over 500 hours. Most games can be brute forced like this anyway, I just wish I felt more of an incentive with Action usage to do things other than hit as hard as possible on every turn.",

            "So I'm still not very good at this game, and wondering what are some ways to improve my build/party. Currently still in Act 1, right now at >!the goblin camp!<.

            "Something driving me crazy - how do you surprise a group of enemies!? I\u2019ve had my Rogue sneak up on a group by themselves, not be seen or detected, fire an attack into the crowd and\u2026 roll for initiative! We\u2019re in normal combat and the rest of the party has to rush in to help. \n\nConversely, there\u2019s been times I can literally see an enemy, but they get surprise on me for attacking first out of combat.\n\nIn the Shadowlands, I could see some enemies hanging out up ahead, my Tav rolled a perception check, passed, and said \u201cseems like a great spot for an ambush\u201d, showing she knew what was about to happen, and they still got surprise and I had to miss a round. \n\nI\u2019d like to nail down exactly how this works before I do an honour mode run, as it\u2019s the one mechanic I don\u2019t currently get.",

            "Multiplayer Online Issue: My friends and I started playing for a few hours and encountered some bugs that were really frustrating for all of us. Personally, throughout all 600 hours of single player, I never encountered these issues:\n\n1. Can't long rest: We tried killing the whole game and restarting, but it didn't work. One of the players can enter the camp but can't leave.\n2. Sometimes, players turn invisible and can't do anything but reload the save.\n3. Dialogues get skipped without pressing anything by the speaker or just stop, making it impossible to proceed to the next talk. This can brick the NPC and mission if we push the say player out of dialogue.\n4. UI disappears: We initiate the talking but there's no UI and option.\n5. No dice rolling UI.\n\nSince it could be an internet problem between us, I was thinking that using a VPN might help a bit or just giving my friend the file and letting others be the host. But we haven't tried it because it's such a bummer that it's almost making them quit the game. Are there any solutions I can try?\n\nThere is some details for my environment: i5 13600k, RTX 2070S, 32GB ddr5 ram, no mods installed at all. all my friend playing with me got equal or better spec, starting from 3060ti to 4090.",

If I talk to a character, does she see that dialogue? What about she talks to someone... Would I see it? \n3. Would she be able to continue the campaign without me around? \n4. Is the whole \"Tav\" storyline (if she picks a custom character) host dependent? Would I see the same cut scenes as her and just be like her supportive custom character friend? \n5.

In-game both the Emperor and Raphael have no idea how they even found out about it.\n\n-Where did the Absolute even come from? Was there always a mind-flayer colony below Moonrise Towers? Did Ketheric even know, or did he plant it there himself? Was Moonrise build atop a colony or was the colony build there after Moonrise was build?\n\n-Everything about the Astral Prism: How did Gortash find out about it, where did Vlaakith store it away, how did Shadowheart even find it, how did Shadowheart get captured yet the Astral Prism was just lying beside her next to her pod, how did the Emperor even enter it in the first place?",

            "I'm running into some odd behavior when trying to multiclass Gale. My ultimate goal was going to be Tempest Cleric 2 / Evo Wizard 10, but right now he's just Level 3. \n\nIf I take his first level in Wizard and select Thunderwave as one of his Wizard spells, the Wizard variant *completely disappears* once I add his first level in Tempest Cleric. It disappears from the radial, it disappears from the spellbook. He only has access to the variant from the Tempest domain, which sucks because he has low Wisdom.\n\nIf I take his first level in Cleric, then attempt to learn Thunderwave when adding his first Wizard level, the game will let me select it - with the usual warning about how he already knows it and will have access to both variants. But once I exit character creation, the same thing happens: The Wizard variant is completely disappeared. It's also gone from the spell selection list when he levels up.\n\n(Another odd thing: If I take his first level in Wizard and add Cleric, it doesn't remember his Cleric cantrip selection. I selected the Light cantrip instead of Sacred Flame, but after exiting, he knows Sacred Flame. What? I don't want it! I tested multiple times to make sure it wasn't just a misclick.) \n\nSo I guess I have a couple of questions.\n\nQuestion 1: Has anyone else heard of this bug and found a way around it?\n\nQuestion 2: Is this a general issue with Prepared vs Always-Prepared spells when you mix classes? An issue with Wizard vs Cleric? Or is it just Thunderwave?

Since the party is full (4 players) I don't think we can add any companions if we don't choose their origin, can we?\n2.

TL;DR - full build [here](https://eip.gg/bg3/build-planner/?buildId=cltqe4nn2008wd4w8a0myff94) (also a nice character planner too, imo the most clear). The stats I chose here are imo the most optimal, but you can tweak them as you please.\n\nWe start as an **high half-elf** (just like Ketheric) **Paladin**. Take the mage hand as a high elf cantrip, it's always useful. Choose your oath as you please, it still **needs to be broken**. The most climatic way to do this is in the act 2 (>!killing the Nightsong in particular!<), but it's definitely your choice when.\n\nGet the **paladin levels asap to 5** (for the extra attack) and choose Great Weapon Fighting, then go with **GOO Warlock** (for frightening crit) till the end (7). For Warlock cantrips I'd choose obviously Eldritch Blast, Friends (as it's always useful) and Bone Chill because reasons.\n\nWith this build you get only 2 **feats**, so imo the most useful are Alert and Charger, although Ability Improvement and War Caster are also nice feats to consider.\n\nAs for **Pact Boon** I think it's **essential to get Pact of the Tome** - it gives free Animate Dead and a magnificent Haste and Call Lightning.\n\nThe **Eldritch Invocations** I find the most fitting are:  \n2 - Agonising Blast (more damage) and Devil's Sight (nice synergy with DJ Shart)  \n5 - One with Shadows (given the cooperation with Shar)  \n7 - Book of Ancient Secrets (for extra spells on hand)\n\nOfc read >!Necromancy of Thay and finish it later in act 3!< , get auntie Ethel's >!hair for bonus STR!<, later make Astarion >!bite Araj for the +2 STR potion!<, and last but not least, take the >!Mirror of Loss!< buffs in act 3, >!both of them - the Patriar's Memory and the +2 CHA buff after succeeding religon check!< (in that order, otherwise you don't get to have the 1st one). In total that gives us a whopping *permanent* 20 STR and 18 CHA (with the stats i chose in the link above).\n\n**Items** I find the most fitting are obviously the Reaper's Embrace (Ketheric's Armor) and Night Walkers (Nere's Boots). Also take the Amulet of Greater Health from >!House of Hope!<, to help with CON.

I killed the 'paladins' with her. I saved the tieflings from the goblins. I gave her the first iron for her engine. But, for some reason, at the party, there was no way for me to tell her I liked her or anything. I did join Lae'zel for the party, but I ended our fling when we got into Act 2. I assume this maybe is the cause of all my problems? Not sure.!<\n\n>!Act 2 - This is where I think I messed up somehow? I gave her the 2nd iron for her engine, but I was unable to kiss her, only hug her. I never got a love scene with her at camp, so nothing happened between us in Act 2.!<\n\n>!Act 3 - I got to the Lower City and Karlach invited me on a date. She said she loved me and I thought I had maybe gotten out of the issue with not nailing her romancing story, but alas, I was wrong. As soon as I meet her friend the next day at Baldur's Gate, she tells her friend that ''Ew, no, we're just friends''. THAT HURT SOBSOB..!<\n\n>!So, my question is; is there NO way to fix this? If I mess up Act 2, is there no way for me to salvage what we had? Or, does she grow more into me if I help her finish her story quest and kill Gortash? What am I supposed to do now?

Or will there be another tadpole-related skill check later? I have unlocked all the Illithid powers at this point, so such a check would be BRUTAL.

            "There are a few things I noticed that could be improved.\n\nThe first is having two fighters. You certainly can succeed with two fighters, but they fill the same role and it would be better if they were built more differently from each other, or even swapped out for another class. This team is lacking a dexterity-based character like a rogue or a ranger, who can act as a sniper with bows (or dual hand crossbows). Swapping Lae'Zel for Asterion is an easy fix for this, or if you want to keep her maybe changing her or your main character to a different class. Gloomstalker rangers are very good, as archers who get bonuses including an extra attack on the first turn. Success in this game is all about action economy, so killing an enemy on the first turn is great, so that the enemy team has fewer actions per turn cycle. A high-dex character is also very useful out of combat, to pick locks and disarm traps. If you go this route make sure their melee weapons have the \"finesse\" property, which allows them to use Dex rather than Str.\n\nWhen you hit level 4 you chose a feat for each character. I highly recommend, on all characters, using this on an ability score improvement (or one of the feats that includes +1 to a stat) to get your primary stat to 18. This is a noticeable buff to your attack accuracy, and for weapon attacks, your damage. There is no benefit to odd numbered stats, they essentially round down to even numbers.\n\nSpell choice: with Shadowheart, the Bless spell is must-have. It's a good idea to cast it in the first turn of every fight (with a level 2 spell slot so you can target all 4 characters). This is a significant buff to attack accuracy, which is very welcome in the early game (but still good the entire game). Spellcasters can have one concentration spell at a time, so if you aren't concentrating on anything, you're leaving value on the table. The other must-have cleric spell is healing word to pick up downed teammates, but you already have that. Enhance Ability, Hold Person, Spiritual Weapon and Command are all great spells too.\n\nWith gale, I suggest preparing Mage armor, and having him cast it in himself outside of combat, right after long resting every day. It lasts all day, and makes his base AC 13. I also suggest re-specing to where his level 1 stats are 16 dexterity, 14 constitution and 16 intellect (then get to 18 intellect at level 4). You can go down to 8 with the other stats if needed. A 16 dex stat will give him a +3 dexterity modifier, which will put his armor class on par with characters who wear actual armor. Combine that with the shield spell (and holding an actual shield), and he becomes your tankiest character. Wizards aren't always able to hold shields, but Gale can be cause he's a human, and it's an easy way to get +2 armor class.",
            "There's a lot to parse here so I'm going to stream of consciousness style write things out as I see them:\n\nYou have an extreme lack of magical gear for being level 4, especially when it comes to weapons. You're missing out on **so much** power just using basic gear.\n\nRunning two Battle Master Fighters certainly is a choice, I would respec one of them into something else to diversify your party's skill sets.\n\nThe feats you took are just plain terrible. The \"Magic Initiate\" feats are there so you can get spells from **other** classes. Taking it for the same class you already are is basically a complete waste of a feat. Durable is also completely pointless as a feat. Should do a simple ASI on Lae'zel to bump CON to 16 and STR to 18.\n\nYour Tav has the Two Weapon Fighting style but isn't dual wielding weapons.\n\nTrickery Cleric is just bad, respec Shadowheart to Light or Life Domain.",
            "I'd recommend putting a shield on Gale, and having him cast Mage Armor on himself each morning. That'll improve his AC from 11 to 16, and should be a noticeable increase in his survivibility. If you need a recommendation for which spell to un-prepare to make room for Mage Armor, I'd recommend Witch Bolt. You also don't have a 2nd level spell prepared on him. I'd recommend swapping your least used among Fog Cloud, Grease, or Sleep for one of the 2nd level spells you've learned on him.\n\nShadowheart also has an open slot for a prepared spell. I'd recommend either Blindness or Hold Person. \n\nBeyond that, you should be fine. >!The Goblin Camp!< has a lot of ways you can approach it, so save often and be willing to experiment. You'll learn a lot about how you can approach problem solving in this game.",
            "Its most likely how you're playing the game rather than your party composition that's failing you. You can beat this game with practically any party composition. People can beat honour mode with single characters.\n\nIf you find you're struggling with encounters, I'd say the #1 thing you can do is consider how you're engaging the enemy and where you're positioning your party. You can leverage surprise in most encounters too, but you have to leverage the game mechanics which are finicky:\n\n- Your entire party must be stealthed\n- You must attack an enemy in a way that *does not* kill them, just damages them\n- Your character must be visible to the enemy if they then looked at you. If you attack out of range, the game seems to register as the enemies look for you, then find you if you're too far away. If you're close, they get surprised. Only the person who attacks must be close by.\n\nAlso if you struggle to use your resources, you need to start liberating yourself of this notion. Scrolls, potions, elixirs, poisons, and bombs all exist to be used. Use them. Especially if you're struggling. Elixirs in particular are quite strong and usually last until long rest, and can be bought at all kinds of merchants every long rest.",
            "Surprise is counterintuitive with a ranged character.\n\nWhenever you ranged stealth attack, you must roll a stealth check to remain hidden. There are two outcomes: 1. if you fail, enemies immediately enter combat; 2. if you succeed, NPCs remain neutral and rush towards your position; if they detect you there, they then enter combat.\n\nIn the second case, you don't get a surprise round because enemies went looking for you. Meaning high stealth ranged character almost never generate surprise rounds lol. The advantage is you can snipe weak enemies without ever entering combat.\n\nIf you want a surprise round, make the initial sneak attack in bright light -you automatically fail your stealth check- or with a char with low stealth. You can even ungroup your rogue, remain hidden and sneak attack separately once another party member has generated the surprise round.\n\n(By the way, some encounters are scripted to be impossible to surprise or to always surprise you.)",

            "This is a game that you can play multiple times in multiple different ways, totaling hundreds of hours of play. You'll get good value out of it as long as you enjoy it.\n\nIn addition to what the previous commenter said: \n\n1. Thoroughly explore new areas of the map as you arrive in them. Don't rush from quest objective to quest objective, even if the story seems to be pressing you to hurry. The game expects you to explore, and you will miss significant content if you don't. This is one of the main ways people lose out on companions, side quests, etc. And then you end up underleveled and struggling. \n\n2. Long rest every 2-3 fights even you don't need to. There are important story scenes that happen during long rests and you won't see them if you don't long rest.\n\n3. Approach the game thoughtfully. Talk to NPCs and pay attention to what they're telling you. Read the books. Consider the possible consequences of your choices. Also, talk to your companions frequently even if they don't have little exclamation points over their heads. \n\n4. If get a pop-up telling you that you're about to advance the story, that's a serious warning and it means some quests will automatically resolve themselves (usually in failure) if you continue. You want to make sure that you've thoroughly explored and taken care of all quests that you can before that.\n\n5. Ask for help if something is confusing or you get stuck. It's a game made for a niche audience that made it big, and so it throws a lot of information at you at once. This is a good community with a lot of people who want you to enjoy it.\n\n6. Autosaves only occur at specific points: After a long rest and when entering certain new areas. You can lose hours of play if you don't quicksave more often. Some people like this risk, but if you don't, do things like quicksave before combat, before important dialogues, etc.\n\nI disagree a little bit about avoiding spoilers - I think that depends on the player. You can make choices with major, story-altering consequences in this game. For some people that is a large part of the fun. For some people that causes unfun anxiety. You know yourself best here. I would try without spoilers first personally but would not be ashamed of looking up the consequences of decisions that seem really crucial if I thought making the wrong choice would diminish my enjoyment (e.g. losing a character).",

If you go wandering around again, don't pick fights with old ladies and *definitely* don't fight githyanki until you are higher level and more comfortable with the combat mechanics. Remember that you can check your enemies' level next to their name, and you can also examine them to get a clearer picture about what sort of threat they might pose.",

Physical armor is only worn down by physical damage, and magical armor is only worn down by magical damage. Many negative statuses (if not all, if I'm remembering correctly) such as if a character is prone or frozen only can be applied once the relevant type of armor is depleted. It is highly recommended to have your party built around dealing one type of damage so you can wear down one type of armor as quickly as possible.\n\nUnlike BG3, there can be a benefit to playing solo or with one companion due to the \"Lone Wolf\" talent, which basically boosts your abilities so long as your party is no larger than 2 characters, including yourself.",

            "What drew her to bard? There's a way to stay a bard and become a heavy hitter in combat. If you respec into college of swords bard, you get these things called attack flourishes. They use up a bardic inspiration charge, but you can do *a lot* of damage this way. The build would be like this:\n\n* College of Swords Bard\n   * Slashing flourish (ranged) lets you shoot two arrows per ranged attack\n* Dual wielding hand crossbows\n* At level 6, bards get an extra attack per turn\n* Slashing flourish + extra attack slashing flourish + offhand crossbow attack = *5 ranged attacks per turn*\n\nYou can only do this many attacks per turn until you run out of bardic inspiration charges, but still. Keep in mind, this isn't a \"frontliner\" build in that she would charge in front of everybody. She should find a good vantage point and rain down arrows from above. \n\nIf she really wants to be up close attacking enemies, then some other classes to consider:\n\n* Barbarian as a class is about getting in enemies' faces, and tanking damage while wailing on them. Rage means slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage all gets halved, so not only do you typically have a lot of health but it lasts longer too. Pretty straightforward class to play. \n* Monk is probably the single most broken class in the game, capable of doing the most damage per turn out of anything. You can just pummel enemies into bloody pulps. But it is kind of gear dependent and needs you to build the character in a specific way to get the most mileage, so I don't think it's the most beginner friendly. \n* Paladins are great frontliners. Divine smite uses a spell slot to boost damage on a melee attack. You get to wear heavy armor and can use a shield, which makes you far less squishy. Paladins also have oaths that are supposed to govern their actions, so that can help guide your roleplay as well.",

            "There are actually a ton of camp supplies throughout the game if you loot somewhat thoroughly, using 40 supplies after every fight is totally sustainable. Additionally, you can buy a pack from volo in your camp each day, as well as other vendors throughout the world whose inventories refresh daily.\n\nThe rule of thumb I generally recommend is to long or short rest after every fight, and therefore long rest at least every 3 fights. But more frequent is reasonable to make sure you're at full power for any significant fight.\n\nFor full casters cantrips should be your basic damage attack. All cantrips get a damage increase at level 5 and again at level 9. At all stages of the game, your highest two levels of spell slots are in short supply and have to be used strategically. Right now in the early game (sounds like you're level 3?), that happens to be all your spell slots. But later on you'll have more - for example at level 7 a full caster will have 4 level 1's, 3 level 2's, 3 level 3's and a level 4. So then you'll want to be careful about picking your spots for level 3 and 4 spell slots, but you can use lower level slots more liberally, and thus rely on cantrips less.\n\nIt will feel like melee characters are doing more damage than your casters in the early game, because they specialize in single-target damage. Casters by contrast specialize in crowd control and area-of-effect damage. Their strength will become more apparent in the mid game (especially level 5+) when they are able to hit half a dozen enemies at once with Lightning Bolt or running around with Spirit Guardians or whatever, while your fighter is still swinging away at 1 enemy at a time. Control spells like Command and Hold Person are extremely strong in the right situation, such as making bosses skip their turns.",

            "As far as maximizing how much content you see, your class choice doesn't super matter. Every class has unique dialogue and such. That said, I would suggest a Sorcerer, Bard or Paladin. They are 3 of the 4 classes that use charisma as their spellcasting stat (the other being warlock), and therefore will have a high charisma stat and be good at persuasion/intimidation/etc. checks in dialogue. That makes the game a bit easier overall and makes you good at resolving some situations without violence, or talking you way into a new area. Those 3 classes also have the distinction of not being represented among the companions you can recruit early. You can change anyone's class without story implications so it's not a big deal, but those 3 are all good choices if you want to keep companions on their default classes without overlap. They represent 3 different playstyles in combat:\n\n* Sorcerers are a ranged spellcaster who excel at battlefield control and area-of-effect damage with their spells.\n* Bards are spellcasters who have access to good support and battlefield control spells. If you choose college of swords or valor as your subclass, they are more of a spellsword who does damage with weapon attacks and supports it with their spells. So bard can be a backline support character, an archer, or a dueling melee character.\n* Paladins are a front-line melee character who specialize in smacking things as hard as possible with divine smite.\n\nAs far as getting the most out of a single playthrough:\n\n* Play as a custom character or as the dark urge. Dark urge is also a custom character, but with a pre-set backstory and personal quest. You can be good or evil as durge, you just have some, well, dark urges to sort out and choose to embrace or resist. A normal custom character aka \"Tav\" is more of a blank slate. The other origin characters are all companions, and their stories are better experienced that way. They're extremely well voice acted, but you don't get voice acting for the player character.\n* In act 1 there is a major choice about which faction to side with, and I recommend taking the \"good\" route here even if you intend to be \"evil\" later on. Siding with >!the goblin army!< in act 1 gets a lot of characters killed who will show up later in the game if they're alive. It also causes 2 of the main companions to leave the party permanently.\n* Explore thoroughly, and by region. If you pay a lot of attention to the quest long and go from marker to maker you're liable to miss a lot of stuff. There is interesting stuff to find *everywhere*.\n* Long rest (aka go to bed) often. The game makes it seem like time is of the essence, and in-fiction it is. But it's not really connected to a \"calendar\" in that way. There are some \"you have to deal with this today\" situations - never walk away from a burning building - but you don't have to worry about too many days passing causing a quest or the state of the world to change. It's a common mistake to not rest enough, which can cause you to miss out on camp scenes that only happen once per night, and it also makes combat harder for yourself unnecessarily. My rule of thumb is to short or long rest after every fight, and therefore long rest at least every 3 fights.\n* When you transition between maps, you will get a pop-up warning asking if you want to venture forth. Heed these warnings - they are the thing to actually be concerned about when it comes to accidentally advancing quests or changing the world state. When you get to one it's not a bad idea to look up a guide for the area you've already done to see if you missed anything. The most common way people accidentally skip content is by going through one such warning towards the end of act 2, not realizing it cuts off the entire first half of the game.\n* Swap companions in and out. At any given time you have an active party of 4 including yourself, and the rest of the companions stay in camp. There are 6 companions you can recruit in the first few hours of the game, and a few more to be found later. Much of their story happens at camp or in encounters out in the world they don't necessarily need to be present for, but each companion does have a few things they want to be there for. You can experience the totality of all the companion stories while only occasionally changing up your active party.",

            ">found Gale in his wormhole thing (he\u2019s a talker, huh?)\n\nlol\n\nSome answers:\n\n1. Your squad basically has shared inventory. While they do all have their own technically, anyone in your party can use whatever from the rest of the party's inventory. So there's really no reason to switch characters for shopping purposes.\n\n2. I'm on ps5, and to move things from one inventory to another, I have to press the square button which will bring up the \"what to do with this\" menu, you can send to camp (camp chest) or to an individual person.\n\n3. No need to switch who you're controlling to keep everyone's inventory even, however I'll often switch to my strongest character to loot after battles because they can carry the most, and it saves me the step pf just transferring everything to them.\n  HOWEVER, you may want to occasionally have a certain character handle a certain conversation (for instance, if you need that charisma for a high persuasion check) in which case you'd want to control them and keep your MC far far away.\n\n4. You can swap them out as much as you want to. You can only have 4 active party members at a time, but there's a lot of space at camp for a reason. When you swap them out, they'll just go back to camp, and you can go back to camp to change as long as you're not in the middle of a fight or in a hostile area.\n\n5. Your companions don't care about each other, and will not have much at all to say if you try to make them talk. Also there was an issue for a while with post-fight cutscenes triggering with whoever was closest to the person doing the talking rather than with your MC, and the fix for that has made it often difficult to get other to have conversations at all.\n\n7. Yes. Or you could respec someone whose class isn't going to be much use. There are als plenty of potions to be found while looting everything.\n\n8. I pretty much always \"barter\", I just like the interface better. I can't remember exactly what he has, but generally I don't buy simple +1 armor or weapons early on (needs to have a special properties for me to spend money, especially early on). Make sure you also visit the other vendor in the grove.\n\n9 Just have fun with it, and don't stress if things don't go exactly how you want due a bad roll or something. The early levels are usually the hardest because you're all low level and can't do much cool stuff, so make sure you explore every small area before moving around a whole lot, or you'll end up in over your head.\n\nAlso, make sure you do plenty of long rests, it's where you get a lot of story and companion progression, especially in the early game.",

            "1/2- Your inventory is pretty much shared. You can give anything to anyone after purchasing it, and if they are in your active party, you can drink a potion, use an item from anyone else's inventory. So one person can have all the scrolls, or all the potions, and everyone can read them/use them as if they were in their own possession.\n\n3- sometimes you may want to switch so that one person doesn't become too encumbered and slow down, but just wait for that to be a problem\n\n4-You can add everyone to your \"group\" but only 4 are in an active party. The rest can hang out in your camp until they're called up on and you just swap them out with no ill-effects>\n\n5- For the most part, your primary character is the focus of most conversations and the game will default to them. The only way to keep Shadowheart in all convos is to have her as your origin character.\n\n6- Some characters can use this trait easily. Look em up.",
            "You've already gotten good answers. Just a couple of additions that might make your life easier.\n\nRegarding consumables -  You do *not* need to stock every character with healing potions, bombs, specialty arrows, and so on. You can always send things between characters, even during combat. I find it a lot easier to keep all consumables on my main character (since they're always in the party), and then send them to other characters in the party as needed. I only have other characters carry stuff if my character is getting encumbered or if it's stuff only they will ever use.\n\nRegarding buying items -  You want to do this with the character that has the highest persuasion modifier because it will affect the prices. After buying them, you can send them to the character they're for by scrolling to that item in your inventory and bringing up the menu. On PS5, this is the square button. I don't know what it is on Xbox. \n\nTo equip something on another character, they need to be the active character. When they're the active character, \"Equip (Shadowheart)\" or whatever will also show in the menu for that item. On PS5, left trigger is what pulls up the character selection.\n\nRegarding switching out party members - Anyone you recruit will hang out in your camp when they're not in your active party and can be switched out at any time. For the most part it doesn't matter who's with you, but pay attention when you're about to do something that's related to a companion's personal backstory or quest. You'll get the best story (and the best relationship) if you include them.\n\nRegarding speak with animals - Yes, absolutely buy the potions. They last until the next long rest, so you don't need 30 of them, but there will be portions of the game where you don't have vendors selling them daily. I would maybe try to keep 5 on hand and just drink them before you are interacting with an animal (which won't be every day).\n\nRegarding bartering - there's no haggling in this game. The two different options are just for if you want to buy things directly with gold, or if you want to trade items for things. But you will need to have the exact price or better no matter what.\n\nRegarding what to buy - it's usually not worth it to buy the non-unique gear. Soon you'll start to find gear that's as good or better. The only time I buy non-unique gear is if it's to fill an obvious hole in the progression, like if everyone has a +1 or +2 weapon but Lae'zel is still running around with a common longsword. +2 armor can also be good if you haven't yet found a unique piece for a character as well. Whether you should buy a unique item depends a lot on your party and builds.\n\nRegarding tips - play it a lot like a DnD campaign but with a dumb computer behind it. It really rewards exploration, talking to NPCs, doing side quests, and so on (and punishes you with underleveling and lack of loot if you don't). Don't treat the quest log as a to-do list to check off, but as a guide to which parts of the story/world you might want to explore next. Be thoughtful.\n\nThe narrative FEELS really urgent but there are few actual time-sensitive quests. Also, long resting is easy and cheap - and necessary if you want to experience story scenes that happen at camp. Long rest a lot more than you would in a regular DnD campaign. I try to long rest after every 2-3 encounters and before major story beats even if I don't really need to.",

Each character also has a \"Proficiencies\" tab in their sheet where you can see what kinds of equipment they can use;\n\n2. That's... complicated and I'm sure others will have better answers, but what I do is have a character carrying most stuff and keep a few containers in their inventory (such as backpacks and pouches you pick up). You can add things from your inventory into these containers, so you may have a backpack for scrolls, a pouch for special arrows, a backpack for quest-specific (orange border) items etc. As a note: the vast majority of books isn't useful to carry around \u2014 in general you'll notice when a given book is crucial for a quest, you'll have a cutscene or a remark, and it'll also often be orange-bordered \u2014 so just ensure you read each book by going through all the pages in case it has any relevant knowledge.",

There are some great spells for this at every tier. Some favourites:\n\n- Command, Grease\n- Crown of Madness, Spike Growth, Web\n- Hunder of Hadar, Hypnotic Pattern, Slow, Sleet Storm\n\nThere are some circumstantially great spells as well, like Silence (trivializes the Harpy fight) and Darkness (can be used by Wyll/other Devil Sight warlock as a defensive resource). \n\nCritically, you don't need to shut them all down. The key is that you want to break up their effectiveness so that they're not all able to go all out all at once. \n\n2) **Pick off the Troublemakers** From there, you concentrate down the casters and anyone obstructing your effectiveness (like someone threatening your ranged striker). Clear up the troublemakers so that everyone is working to maximum efficiency.\n\nItems like arrow of many targets should be bought every opportunity you get. Use special arrows liberally.\n\n3) **Use the environment** You should also look for funnel choke points to abuse that force enemies to come to you. High ground reached by ladders is great for the ranged bonus/penalty factors and forcing enemies to climb to reach you - possibly through a well placed HoH.\n\n4) **Live, Laugh, Love, Shove** Since you'll be using a lot of AOE control spells like Spike Growth, Web, and Hunger of Hadar, invest in being good at forcing enemies into or back into those or other environmental hazards.\n\nThe Absolute controlled media doesn't want you to know this but the lava at the Nere fight is free, Karlach is allowed to push or throw as many Duregar into it as she wants.",

All classes are viable when single-classing but rogue is one of the weakest in that regard.\n\nOne of the benefits of assassin is advantage (= guaranteed sneak attack) on enemies that haven't moved yet, which doesn't require a surprise round, just being earlier in the turn order. Thief is generally better if you're dual-wielding since it let you attack with bonus actions.\n\nAssassin/Gloomstalker Ranger with at least 5 levels of Ranger is extremely good (even 5 rogue / 5 ranger / 2 fighter), and can be highly optimized for single-target damage. Thief/Gloomstalker is similarly good. This works for archery builds or with finesse melee weapons such as rapiers, shortswords and daggers.",
            "Once you get into multiclassing you have to worry more about your stats and your class progression - there's just no way around it. You don't need to make a \"perfect\" build (a lot of people run goofy multiclasses just for fun), but it's a lot easier to break a multiclass. For example, Cleric casts spells using their wisdom stat, and Sorcerer casts spells using their Charisma stat, meaning that if you combine these classes at least one of these stats will be lackluster, leading to lower hit/success rates. It's possible to build around this and come up with a great Cleric/Sorcerer build (Tempest Cleric/Storm Sorcery is very popular), but making those decisions requires understanding these kinds of issues. Also, you have to decide on your break points: How many levels in each? \n\nI had a lot of fun on one run with Lae'zel as a Tempest Cleric/Ranger. I chose Ranger because I wanted to give her some martial abilities (especially extra attack), but I also wanted at least a 1/2 caster class so I would lose fewer spell slots with the multiclass. And Ranger uses Wisdom also, so I didn't have to worry about which spellcasting stat to maximize. By the time I had her set up, I could park her in a puddle of water, which she would electrify, constantly knocking enemies back and making them go prone. Then she could whack them with her electric hammer. It wasn't the most broken, meta build, but it was effective and hilarious and really leaned into that storm lightning/thunder theme without doing the same old \"another sorcerer?? okay\" thing. She could also cast call lightning and do a lot of damage, and since both ice and lightning do double damage to wet enemies, she synergized really well with my ice-based caster.\n\nYou could also multiclass Tempest/Wizard, though I think you might find that it plays like a lesser version of the Tempest/Sorcerer build that's so popular. The main benefit is you would have access to learning spells from scrolls, making you a much more flexible caster - is that a benefit, though, if you're going to focus mostly on lightning damage? The answer to that question is going to depend a lot on how you want to play.",

Your character then uses whichever total is higher. All items and bonuses that give flat increases to the stat are applied to your natural stat, not to the item's stat.\n\nFor example, there is a potion in the game that increases strength by 2 permanently. There is also an elixir that sets your strength to 21 until a long rest.\n\nSay you have a character with a natural Strength of 16. They then take the elixir that increases it to 21.

            ">wizard slots\n\nThat's not really a thing. Spell slots are class-agnostic, except for Warlock spell slots which are special. 1 cleric / 11 wizard (or any combination of full casters) will have a level 6 spell slot they can use on any of their spells.\n\nThe [Spells page on the wiki](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Spells) has a discussion of spell slots and multiclassing and a chart to tell you how many spell slots you have based on your ESL (Effective Spellcaster Level). You add together your levels from each class, but some classes are only half- or third-casters, so the level from that class is that fraction of their level, rounded up. For example ranger is a half-caster, so a 7 cleric / 5 ranger would have an ESL of 10 (7 from cleric + 3 from ranger, since 5/2 rounds up to 3), and therefore the same spell slots a level 10 cleric would have.\n\nBe very careful about mixing classes that have different spellcasting stats. With Wizard/Cleric, your wizard spells use intellect and your cleric spells use wisdom. It's difficult to have a good stat in both because any caster also cares about their dexterity and constitution. In general you can't have more than 3 good stats unless you use replacement items like the [Warped Headband of Intellect](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Warped_Headband_of_Intellect).",

You'll also have people who don't like strategy, who *can't* put the time or energy into trying this game at its most difficult (before honor mode existed), etc. Like the difficulty itself advertises, players who want to engage in the story mode will go to the difficulty that tells them point-blank \"hey, this one lets you encounter the story more!\" That's why I picked balanced my first time.

Note that Paladin 5 / Sorcerer 7 does not get you extra slots because of the paladin caste rlevel rounding down to 2, but you do get to learn 4th level Sorcerer spells.

            "In addition to heavy armor, Tempest Clerics get a Channel Divinity ability that maximizes your lightning or thunder damage. You also have a reaction that deal lightning or thunder damage to enemies that hit you with a melee attack.\n\nHowever I wouldn't go with a single-classed Cleric for this, mainly because they're simply not very good with making weapon attacks. They never get Extra Attack, so even if you focus on their attack stat like you would for a martial class, their weapon damage falls off drastically at level 5 (when martial classes get Extra Attack). Divine Strike does not make up for it.\n\nHere's what I would do: \n\nTempest Cleric 6 / Eldritch Knight Fighter 6. This gives Thor an Extra Attack and a Fighting Style - I would go with Defense to increase his AC. It also lets him bind and throw his hammer. If you take Cleric first, you get a Wisdom saving throw proficiency; if you take Fighter first, you get a Constitution saving throw proficiency. Both are very good in BG3. He will get Call Lightning at Tempest Cleric 5, and Thunderbolt Strike at Tempest Cleric 6. Fighter 6 will give you a feat, so he will still have 3 feats like most classes get despite the multiclass. \n\nMake Strength his primary stat and wisdom his secondary stat. I would try to start with 17 STR and 16 Wisdom, then take Tavern Brawler as his first feat to get his STR to 18 and to make his thrown hammer do a lot more damage. Then your next two feats can be used to improve your Strength to 20, and to take the Alert feat for better initiative.\n\nThe hammer you eventually want is the [Charge-Bound Warhammer](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Charge-Bound_Warhammer), which you can get from Dammon in the Last Light Inn. This will do additional lightning damage if he binds it as an EK Fighter. (Actually, it seemed to do the extra lightning damage without binding it in previous patches, but I don't know if that's still true. The wiki doesn't mention.) You can use the Ring of Flinging to increase throw damage as well.\n\nI did a similar build with Lae'zel where I used the Watersparkers and the Sparkswall ring, which makes the wearer immune to electrocution. Then added in Gloves of Belligerent Skies and Ring of Spiteful Thunder for the Reverberation debuff. The playstyle was basically to cast Create Water, then have her stand on it and take all comers. It was pretty fun. Many enemies would just be knocked back or knocked prone, and those that managed to get close got a hammer to the face.",

But you can't get the bomb in this playthrough, since he died in act 2 (the moonrise prisoners die when you enter the shadowfell, if they aren't already rescued at that point). Since you've been to the control center, you might need to load an older save from before you entered the lower level of the factory. I believe being seen by enemies in the lower level also breaks your deal with gortash, cutting off your ability to stage the rescue.\n\nIf you don't disable the steel watch, fighting gortash is indeed much harder (but not impossible) because of the steel watchers.\n\nI should mention, fighting gortash at all is optional - you could just uphold your deal with him.",

Do we need to save Toobins family first (we found the sub but Gortash threatened us and we turned back)?\n\nYes, Toobin will not help you unless his daughter is safe. You need to get on the sub and rescue the prisoners from the undersea prison. There are two more non-Gondian NPCs that are important\ndown there too. One is of particular importance if you have Wyll with you. Before getting on the sub, make sure you have ways of boosting your party's move speed such as haste, potions of speed, and dimension door.\n\n> Does not doing the shut down just make Gortash harder to fight since Watchers are all active?\n\nYes, failing to disable the Steel Watch makes Gortash much harder to approach and harder to fight. There are Steel Watchers all over Wyrm's Rock as well as in Gortash's office for the boss fight.",

Completely fell in love with the world on my first play through and decided to give resist durge a run after hearing how fun that can be. Love the idea of a character struggling to control their awful urges. The dichotomy of desires and reason/compassion conflicting was such a compelling narrative. Really enjoyed it. Genuinely was crying at the redemption scene.\n\nWas outside having a cigarette really not an exaggeration to say this game has dominated my thoughts these past few weeks.  \"I know It's only a game and I'm playing the role, but if this was real life, would I be able to stop myself if my impulses were screaming to murder someone?\". Then I said to myself \"Of course you couldn't you have heart palpation and are taking beta blockers, yet you're standing here doing something that's going to kill you and you can't stop yourself, I'm not a master of my emotions. I'm a slave to this shit just as much as murder Durge is a slave to his desire to murder\". The thought really floored me. I actually stopped what I was doing and felt repulsed at myself for smoking in a way I hadn't felt in a long time. Ashamed how long I've let this go on and get worse, all because my desires told me to do something and I wasn't strong enough to pass the IRL will check to just fucking stop it, even if it meant I could die. Of course I wouldn't be able to stop if I was Durge. I don't know the last time I felt so weak and pathetic.\n\nThrew out all my cigarettes, got nicotine patches which I'm currently using. I haven't gone a cigarette/nicotine pouchless day in nearly two years before this. I'll have a nicotine free day soon. I'm going to beat this shit this time. You find inspiration and clarity in the strangest ways. Maybe this game will have a real impact on my life and give me a few years if I can summon the resolve to make this stick. It's not going to be easy, but I guess that's the point.\n\nDon't expect anyone to care, just felt nice putting these thoughts to text.\n\nEdit: I wish I could respond to everyone being so kind to me, it really moves me.

            "Yes and no. Remember, Astarion is implied to be one of the first of Cazador's spawn and he has been one for about 200 years. 7,000 divided by 200 is 35 victims a year. We know that Astarion was forced into what was essentially forced into prostitution along with his other siblings, so 35 spaced between multiple people isn't exactly a lot over the course of a year. This all implies that some victims were actually drained of their blood and killed since we sort of know that Astarion alone was being forced out to hunt way more than 35 times a year. \n\nThe problem is that 7000 altogether is still a pretty huge number, especially when you consider that given the state of the spawn, Cazador must have been feeding them at least a little. The logistics of this are insane. \n\nSo I get why the devs used 7,000, but I still agree that it was a bit too high.",
