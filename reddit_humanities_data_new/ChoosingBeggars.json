As I\u2019m waiting on the dryer (usually takes 70 minutes) I do the dishes, and tidy up. Put the laundry away\u2026 Remember, laundry is once a week.  With any help she\u2019d need upstairs,  I\u2019m at 3 and a half\u2026. Maybe 4 hours.  I go home and live my life.

(10$) And the state takes taxes\u2026.\n\nI\u2019m not here to argue, I just broke things down and put it in a realistic scenario. \n\nY\u2019all are looking at this post as a job for someone that relies on it solely as their only income\u2026 that\u2019s not really what this post is about\u2026",

Taking your other kid to daycare, tidying the house, and doing dishes and laundry is his job when you're recovering from surgery. If he can't do it, you have the grandparents stay with you and help. If you don't have any of those people available, maybe having another baby when you already have a toddler in the house wasn't an amazing idea.",

An attempted vaginal delivery with an emergency c section is not the same recovery as a planned c section.   If she upped the pay and cut out that part about availing and just said carry my food upstairs this wouldn\u2019t be OTT.  Ideally all of this would be performed by her partner.",

I can\u2019t tell based off of language where they are but they may have chosen to stagger their paid time off to delay paying for highly expensive newborn daycare.  She most likely can\u2019t drive because of the pain medication, bending and loading and unloading dishes and laundry and getting a toddler dressed are above what you can do the first couple of weeks with a c section.

I need a break from that shit and literally am looking for something easy and in the morning so I can be flexible with the rest of the day. \nI would honestly do something like this. \nI would work for that lady.  \nAnd like I said before if she ever demanded more, I\u2019d ask for a raise or simply say no. I moved across the US for my current job, it\u2019s a small business and I\u2019m very capable so the owners often wanted more that I could give/was paid to give. And had no problem telling them no or to set realistic expectations.",

Here, the child is already asleep, but it doesn\u2019t matter bc you\u2019d have to get up in the middle of the night to work this job. The flat rate I typically see for overnights (and have used myself) is around $100-$150. This will vary based on the area of course, but an overnight flat rate is typically standard.\n\nAssuming this child gets up at 7am, that\u2019s around 5 hrs of work a nanny would need to be paid their regular per hour rate. In my area, that would be around $25/hr. So, if we say the overnight fee is $100 and combine that with around 5x$25, this would be around $225 in total. \n\nMaybe some people would do this for $140, but for professional childcare, this would be considered very low pay. (At least where I\u2019m from.) Maybe a stay-at-home mom could make this work, or someone who gets off of their regular job late at night, but in general, the hours aren\u2019t ideal. 1:20 am is an incredibly inconvenient start time for most people haha.",
