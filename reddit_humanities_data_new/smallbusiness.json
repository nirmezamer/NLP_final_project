            "Hi all. \n\nI'm starting an automation consulting company after many years of torturous work on Wall Street (I'll get into that below). \n\nPretty much, I'll:\n\n* build/revamp your entire website\n* build or optimize a user friendly CRM system\n* set up chatbots for customer service, Q&A, lead capturing, appointment booking, and more\n* create content for social media and set up a posting schedule\n* set up client contact systems (like texts/emails to send them offers so they become customers/repeat customers)\n* more, specific to your business and what you want\n\nAll of this will be 100% automated and ALL in one singular online dashboard for you to check on whenever you want. The automation part is my specialty because... this is exactly what I did for Hedge Funds (except on a larger scale with people yelling at me constantly). \n\n  \n**This** is the fun part (for you) - because I want to get actual testimonials and review, and more importantly REFERRALS, I will do this for your business **for free or as low cost as I possibly can**. The intention is, if I do a good job, that you'll give me referrals and great public reviews. \n\n  \nMy background: I worked on IBM Watson and created a chatgpt internally about 6 years before chatgpt itself. And for the last few years, I spent it on Wall Street doing tech implementations for cloud systems, pretty much automating everything in sight. In the nerdiest way possible, I was a sniper for repetitive tasks that could be fixed by writing a script. (Let me enjoy the built up image I have in my head). \n\n  \nDM me, or reply on here.

The amount of greed and entitlement that surrounds the people in the industry is too much and I got sick of it and quit. After almost a year of working back in a restaurant I decided to take the knowledge I learned and try to do something about it. I woke up and devised a plan to slowly bleed out and destroy the greedy industry and give small business a chance again. I created two cash advance companies, almost a year apart. The first was simply to distract my competitors while the second slowly grows like a tumor on his side, until it\u2019s too late.

One of our bigger clients (which amounts for roughly 6% of our annual turnover) was in urgent need of 100 pieces of a certain part. When I say urgent, I mean they needed it delivered within two hours, it was an emergency. We only had 63 in stock, so I had to get the rest from a competitor who offered a lesser quality equivalent for about half the price (our product is made in Japan and has a shit ton of certificates and strict quality control checks, theirs is made in God-knows-where without any certificates available).\n\nI offered them both the 63 Japanese ones and the 37 knock-off ones as a single product with a 15% discount to account for the low quality ones, which I explained albeit over phone instead of an email. The purchasing officer expressed his dissatisfaction over our pricing, but then proceeded with the order.\n\nThe next morning, the head of the purchasing department called me to complain about our prices compared to the competitor that offered the knock-off version for much cheaper. I explained to them the situation and he seemed to accept it. At around 2pm of the same day, I got a heated email in all caps from the owner exclaiming that we betrayed their trust by overcharging them, implying that we have been scamming them for years. He also claimed that he will take any legal measures possible so that they won't pay us any amounts owed based on this incident.\n\nIs there any possibility they will screw us over and actually dodge payment by taking us to court?

They give me a lot of business, but they\u2019re slow to pay, primarily due to poor operations & cashflow on their end (considering they just laid off their one and only project manager, now the owner absorbed that role). \n\nThey\u2019re 7 days late on an invoice that was net-30. This is a recurring issue. I started to slowly cut them off late this week - things took a little longer than they usually do. I\u2019ve sent their invoice to their operations manager 7 times with QuickBooks showing they\u2019ve looked at it 19 times. I also personally emailed the ops manager Monday. No response. The ops manager is the wife of the owner. \n\nThe owner came to me yesterday & today with a few \u201curgent\u201d things, but I responded in a few hours instead of ASAP. \n\nSo today, in my responses explaining code, I included to the owner an invoice to the outstanding invoice. The owner sent me a note saying that made him feel uncomfortable, saying my communication had been lacking, they need things done urgently, and it doesn\u2019t work for him that I don\u2019t let him know urgently when things will be done. Emphasis on urgently. Oh, all while saying it\u2019s typical for him to take a say to respond to things. \n\nI responded to him saying it doesn\u2019t work for me that he pays the invoice whenever they want, and I can commit to responding faster if they pay their invoices on time. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m 26, only 3 years into this business full time, and it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve stuck up for myself.

For money.\n\nIt's possible that they're the kind of client who will try more of this, including increasing threats to drop you as a vendor/provider. Never react emotionally to this - it's a business decision that they can choose to make, and they are only one client; never give the impression they have leverage or that you're willing to provide extra service for free or discounts, because they will continually push for more. If they do drop you, be completely professional about it - don't react to any 'reason' they come up with.

When you quote them for a project, you don't start working until they've paid you enough to at least cover COGS. Update their contact to reflect the new terms when you can, and if you're feeling generous you can even include a clause that billing returns to normal after six consecutive on-time post-work payments.

When I work for my clients, I expect to be paid so I can pay my own bills. I think the best thing to do is for me to be paid in advance for my time. I can offer you, for example, 5 hour, 10 hour or 20 hour blocks that you can pay in advance (give them a discount for more hours paid in advance). For now, you'll help them with the most urgent things to keep them afloat until they pay, but you will not perform your regular work until they pay you in full plus in advance. \n\nI had a client that a friend warned me about. I always charged him advance but one day I slipped up and forgot to send him the invoice and he pissed me off by accusing me for the 5th time over something I hadn't even done that I had explained to him already, so I told him to get lost. I sent him a report of everything I had done, removed myself from all admin accounts, and sent him the final bill. It took me a year to get it paid, I got 10% more out of him.",

            "The economy sucks for sure. Graphic design will continue to be devalued in the eyes of many with ai dominating multiple design tools.  We used to pay a graphic designer and have switched over to ai based Canva for starters project development. It has saved us thousands. Not saying we are the norm but my guess is that your field is slowly being absorbed into ai. There will always be a need for a human touch to graphic design. However if you can remove a chunk of the workflow there won\u2019t need to be as many designers.",
