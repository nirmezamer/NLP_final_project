            "I was on E line earlier today(Thursday morning) and I had encountered a man at Atlantic station that was giving me the most negative vibes ever and usually I never pay attention to anybody but this person struck me as behaving strangely, and not on drugs or alcohol strangely, but like he was timing something out.\n\nI was walking up the ramp to the platform at Atlantic and this guy in a gray hoodie in his 20s was walking ahead of me until he suddenly started slowing down and stoping in the middle of the pathway. I glanced at him and he wasn\u2019t looking at his phone just standing there looking at the metro ambassadors walking towards us. I walked in the very back train car and I finally see him come in, I don\u2019t believe he paid for fare. He sits at the end of the train car where the door to the conductor is. There\u2019s a family with a baby and another guy sitting nearby. The sus guy looks straight ahead and is very quiet, never looks at a phone or anything which I thought was weird. He looks straight at me and the family with a neutral expression.\n\nSo I try to ignore the fact that this guy is giving me bad vibes and the family gets off at Marvilla or Mariachi Plaza. As soon as the family leaves he gets up and I thought he was going to get off but he ends up sitting right behind me where I can\u2019t see him.\n\nUltimately nothing happened, but I was counting the stops from there wanting to get the hell off. I actually thought about just switching train cars but there was hardly anybody on the train and it was running quickly.\n\nPerhaps a big nothing burger in the end but I\u2019m sure you guys have had moments where a person just gave off creepy sus vibes for some reason.\n\nBTW on the way back to Atlantic station, I came across like 50 high school aged guys on skateboards on E line around 2:00PM getting off on the stop after the river crossing. Likely unrelated to this incident since this happened on an Eastbound train but still made me think about them earlier.",

Snitch!\u2019\u201d the witness recalled. \u201cThe train car ends up taking off. The next thing you know, it stops because usually train cars will stop and let the late people get on the train. But in this case, those people ended up pulling out a gun and shooting a guy point blank.\u201d\n\nThe victim almost got away. But instead these monsters painted the E train walls with the contents of this poor guy's skull.\n\nI wonder, does the train get taken out of service after something like this? Or do they just hose off the blood, brain and skull fragments and put it back on the line?\n\nLA 2028 baby!!",

            "it's cause the cops and security are too afraid to confront them or tell them to pay for a fare or gtfo. so instead they just shift over to the completely harmless, frail old white and latino homeless transients who aren't a threat to anyone and bully them off the trains instead.",

            "This statement is untrue. Releasing video isn\u2019t going to be the cause of Metro losing ridership. The story of what occurred is out there already so let\u2019s move past that and focus solely on video release, in total. \n\nUse some critical thinking skills here. What good would releasing the video do for the public? Does the public as a whole want to see someone get shot in the head on public transit? Stills of the suspects, okay. There is an active investigation and in any active investigation, video is withheld. It\u2019s not just a Metro thing. \n\nThese suspects had an altercation with this victim off Metro and chased him on to Metro where they shot him. How is that Metro\u2019s fault? Would you blame a hotel if someone was chased into the lobby and shot & killed there? \n\nMetro is blamed for crime when they are a transportation agency. They move 1.2M PER DAY. Of course there will be crime and yes, it\u2019s unacceptable but we must remember that Metro\u2019s #1 job is transportation. Societal issues seep onto Metro but look at yourselves and the lack of accountability and responsibility we all take for a system our tax dollars pay for. \n\nDo better.",

            "i never said it was metro's fault. if anything its the cops and securities fault for letting these degener*tes on the train in the first place. they don't do a good enough job of keeping the criminals off the trains and busses and in the end its us who suffer because of it. i don't even like driving and would love to take the metro everywhere but i can't even get on anymore without some crckhead or unhinged gang member ruining the feeling of safety.",
            "maybe not murder but they definitely have a reputation for violence, property damage, assaults, battery, etc.",
            "You said, \u201cLASD does not release violent incidents that occur on Metro trains. they're instructed not to do so for fear of losing ridership.\u201d\n\nThe implication being that Metro instructs them to withhold the video. \n\nDepending on area, LAPD, LASD, and LBPD all do law enforcement on the trains and buses which is paid for by Metro. I\u2019m in agreement that they need to do a better job of securing the system BUT I still don\u2019t understand what the relevance of your original comment is and why you think it is correct.",
            "This, and if they\u2019re not doing shit like that they still tend to be obnoxious little assholes that vape on trains and busses and almost hit people on the sidewalk. Can\u2019t wait for these little shits to go back to school",
            "it wouldn't really be on Metro to release the footage anyway. the way it typically works after a violent altercation occurs on board is they will give that footage to law enforcement. and then law enforcement will decide whether or not to provide the footage to local news stations for broadcasting, depending on whether or not they have leads on a suspect.",
            "yup, spot on. unfortuantely these types of dudes just skip school so they can smoke weed and inhale whippits. school is nothing to them."
