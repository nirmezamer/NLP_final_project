            "Played cws dd for the past couple leagues. Still never sure how the interaction with desecrate and DD work.\n\nDo I need to find specific corpses before I enter maps? Do I have to hope kitavas herald gets blown up for a huge ignite?\n\nI'm a fulcrum chieftain for context",
            "About graveyard crafting: Do haunted mods work differently in terms of weighting? \n\nI tried doing a craft trying to fracture 2 \"normal\" prefixes and a haunted suffix (pure armour body with 2 armour prefixes and reduced crit damage taken), so I treated it like other crafts and put a -1 explicit, 300% to fracture, increased crit+defense and reduced other ones. \n\nCraft of Exile showed a 22% chance (it's more like 60% if I didn't care about which armour prefixes I got) of success and I did a 4 item craft. I got 3 items with triple armour prefixes and one with a mana haunted suffix.\n\nAm I just unlucky or there's something extra here? Yes, I had the correct ilvl and, yes, I had a haunted mod corpse.",
            "Desecrate summons corpses from the zone you're in and from your spectre pool (previous spectres you had). Monsters have a specific multiplier for spectre life, so you want to create a spectre pool with monster that have the greatest multipliers (like kitava's herald with 300%). Some T17 monsters have even greater multipliers (300% was the maximum for \"vanilla\" monsters until 3.24). Also, the bigger you spectre pool gets, the higher the chance of a corpse coming from there.\n\nYes, you are effectively hoping for a Kitava's Herald or some other big corpse to blow up but that's not uncommon if you're constantly using desecrate (e.g.: with CWS).",
            "As far as I'm aware, craft of exile has never accurately represented how tier restrictions cause weight to be shifted to the remaining tiers and I don't think the degree of weight shifting was ever fully worked out.\n\nSince haunted mods don't have tiers, I would expect their likelihood to be lower than what COE shows, since all of the non-haunted mods will have higher actual weights.\n\nIt also doesn't sound like your result was outside normal deviation.",
            "Understood so far so good. I've raise spectre on kitavas herald. A couple of those cage monsters on the tower part in act 6 and some monsters that were recommended in delve. I think the total I've raised was about 6 or 7. Should I raise 3 more from high health corpses to fill my desecrate pool to result in more consistent big ignites? And what are those? I can't seem to find a good list.\n\nEdit: changed level to health.",
            "The multiplier for Kitava's Herald is 360%, not that that detail is particularly relevant.\u00a0\n\n\nSome league specific monsters occasionally exceed that, and this league we have T17 specific monsters that intentionally exceed it.\n\n\nThere's a base chance of 15% to create a corpse of one of your saved spectres, but their corpses also get added to the pool of available corpses in the area with an even weighting, resulting in a higher chance to get a high HP spectre the more different types you've saved.\n\n\n/u/HeyChrisPena you could check out the CoC DD guides for this league, they should contain detailed instructions. IIRC the maximum is 11 spectres? Anyway, it's not as critical for ignite, since you only need to hit one high HP corpse, but the more you have, the greater your chance of hitting one earlier."

This is series now has a LOT of videos and is an amazing resource.\n\n[Path of Exile Build Archive](https://pobarchives.com/) - This site grabs PoBs from all over and compiles them together in a way that makes searching for builds very easy!\n\n/r/CorePathofExile - if you're looking for a more general place to talk about PoE outside of the main sub\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n# NOTE: A lot of these builds are 3.23/3.22 Builds. They may still be viable as some have been been left largely untouched. Just ignore anything that mentions leagues other than Necropolis. There may have been some changes with transfigured gems for these builds as well so make sure to check out the descriptions and pinned comments.\n\n# NOTE 2: This leagues mechanic is ***unskippable*** this means you will need to interact with it and it will be empowering enemies. Please pick your league starters carefully.\n\n---\n---\n---\n\n# Part 1: Top League Start Suggestions\n\nWe suggest these builds to players who want a good solid build, **new players** who want a build that will help carry them through content and for players looking for reliable league starters.\n\n**Please note** this index is sorted by skill alphabetically not by quality or power level.\n\n\n---\n\n## Detonate Dead\n\n**Build Description:** Detonate Dead (DD) is a spell that explodes a corpse dealing damage around it causing you to ignite enemies and proliferate that through packs for clearing. Since DD scales off corpse life it scales incredibly well simply by progressing in the game. This is a two button play style, so for those who want to press 1 attack this may not be the build for you. Though those that enjoy it you will be rewarded with an well rounded beast of a build that will take you through all content in the game. \n\n**Builds:**\n\n- [Tripolar Bear's Detonate Dead Elementalist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTltqILb790)\n- [Zizaran x ImExile's Detonate Dead Necromancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdzzesMof4Y)\n\n---\n\n## Explosive Arrow\n\n**Build Description:** This build is a totem build with excellent DPS, an easy gear curve and great damage. Because this build is a totem build it\u2019s great for players who find boss mechanics difficult as, like minions, it does damage without you having to be constantly targeting the boss - simply place the totems down and dodge. This build is excellent in both trade and SSF with the primary weapon for this build is a multimod weapon that uses a base that you can farm ([Porcupine](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/The_Porcupine)) and is crafted with essences. This build does have two delays in its damage, there is a wait time as totems \u201carm\u201d themselves and a delay before the arrows explode.\n\n**Builds:**\n\n- [Palsteron's EA Elementalist](https://maxroll.gg/poe/build-guides/explosive-arrow-ballista-elementalist)\n- [Zizaran's EA Champion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i4sJYUpU80) - The Champion version is a fair bit tankier than the Elementalist but has less damage, still plenty to do most content with little investment.\n- [SORO's EA Ignite Elementalist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXtvAleioLE)\n\n---\n\n## Explosive Trap\n\n**Build Description:** Explosive trap is a spell that throws a trap to create multiple explosions when triggered, it deals physical damage which is then converted into fire damage. This skill has *amazing* single target damage on poor to average gear meaning it will carry you through the early bosses with ease. This is a trap skill which means there is a delay between you throwing out the trap and it triggering, this is a playstyle you'll need to try out to see what you think of it. The upside to this though is that you can preload bosses, meaning you can throw a whole bunch of traps on bosses before the fight begins meaning they start combat with a chunk of their HP missing immediately. \n\n**Builds:**\n\n- [FealessDumb0's Explosive Trap Trickster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwRrcfcJSKI)\n\n- [Peuget2's Explosive Trap Trickerster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1KogiGjmEs)\n\n- [Zizaran's Explosive Trap Trickster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqtAFfLVnn8)\n\n- [Palsteron's Explosive Trap of Shrapnel Inquisitor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMQ1eW_dNVU)\n\n- [lifewithoutpants Explosive Trap Trickster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snuOLNEVQIw)\n\n---\n\n## Lightning Arrow\n\n**Build Description:** Lightning arrow (primarily with the Deadeye ascendency) is a bow skill that fires an arrow which causes enemies to be struck with a bolt of lightning, this can also hit other nearby enemies. This is a fast, active playstyle build that uses lightning arrow which has a very high clear speed to blast through maps. This skill is often paired with other skills to boost the single target. This build can feel a little squishy to play and requires a bit more positional play but in exchange provides a fun and fast playing experience.\n\n**Builds:**\n\n- [Crouching Tuna's Lightning Arrow Deadeye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zts3up1Kl6U)\n- [Fubgun's Lightning Arrow Deadeye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLzSRZyhN_M)\n- [Zizaran x Havoc's Lightning Arrow Deadeye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNK3YyJmkc)\n\n---\n\n## Toxic Rain\n\n**Build Description:** Toxic Rain is a skill where you fire a large number of arrows into the air which when they land create pools of toxic ground which deals chaos damage over time in the area. This skill, much like Explosive Arrow, is relatively straight forward to gear for with the craft for the primary weapon being very deterministic. This build is a great all rounder that will take you far.\n\n**Builds:**\n\n- [Peuget2's Toxic Rain Pathfinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7cRYWvwxLY) - 3.24\n- [Palsteron's Toxic Rain Ballista Pathfinder](https://maxroll.gg/poe/build-guides/toxic-rain-ballista-pathfinder)\n- [Fezz's Toxic Rain Champion](https://poe-beginner-guide.com/) \n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n# Part 2: Other League Starters\n\n**Warning:** Unlike the above section there are almost no requirements for builds to make this section, the builds listed here are not necessarily better/worse than the above but the restrictions based on ability to do certain end game content and ssf viability are not enforced in this section. **If you're a new player, we primarily recommend the above builds** but if you're more experienced we show these builds to add to the variety available. **Note: This leagues content is unskippable, please pick your league starters carefully.**\n\n### Absolution\n- [Ronarray's Absolution Guardian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDlPkLObgg4)\n\n### Archmage\n*Note: Getting it's own section in addition to builds going in their own skill sections to help searching.*\n\n- [Palsteron's Archmage Ball Lightning Hierophant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRzgay9ekqo)\n- [Conner Converse/onemanaleft Archmage Mjolner + Early Build](https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/1bne3aj/mjolner_archmage_324_and_early_build_guide/)\n- [Zizaran x Goratha's \\(ArchMage\\) Ice Nova \\(of Frostbolts\\) Hierophant](https://youtu.be/9lZmy1RmOZ4?si=QxM2FHTVI37c5bR4)\n- [u/whitw0rth123's Archmage Ball Lightning Heirophant](https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/1bldhmh/very_tanky_heirophant_going_archmage_ball/)\n\n### Armageddon Brand\n- [Jungroan's Automation Armageddon Brand Saboteur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJEncb6tY)\n\n### Ball Lightning\n- [u/whitw0rth123's Archmage Ball Lightning Heirophant](https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/1bldhmh/very_tanky_heirophant_going_archmage_ball/)\n\n### Blade Vortex\n- [Lolcohol's Poison Blade Vortex Pathfinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUHcmqrrWsc)\n\n### Blink Arrow / Mirror Arrow\n\n- [D3adful Blink Arrow / Mirror Arrow Necromancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-9wqIYXleU)\n\n### Cleave\n- [Woolie's Rage Cleave Berserker and Slayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hQjqATpsbk)\n- [Ronarray's Rage Cleave Berserker](https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/1bnq2yd/my_in_depth_cleave_berserker_league_starter_guide/)\n\n### Cremation\n- [Jungroan's Consuming Dark Cremation Pathfinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zWjhDH_A8)\n\n### Corrupting Fever\n- [Tripolar Bear's Corrupting Fever Champion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrj42Kr3mBc)\n\n### Detonate Dead \n*Cast on Crit, doesn't feel quite right putting a CoC build in the beginner section*\n\n- [Rue x Ventrua's CoC Detonate Dead Inquisitor](https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/1bodv0w/ventrua_1button_coc_dd_inquisitor_w_ruetoo_324/)\n\n### Elemental Hit\n- [SnooBAE85's Reverse Chill Elemental Hit Deadeye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbe8cYoTqVI)\n\n### Exsanguinate \n- [Crouching Tuna's Exsanguinate Mines Trickster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTTixqnBUyc)\n\n### Frost Blades\n- [Zish's Frost Blade Trickster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i0UaKkpuoE)\n\n### Frostblink\n- [Subtractem Forstblink Ignite Elementalist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb2PHGOuq3U)\n\n### Hexblast Mines\n- [Palsteron's Hexblast Mines Saboteur](https://maxroll.gg/poe/build-guides/hexblast-mines-saboteur-league-starter)\n- [Ventrua's Hexblast Trickstet -

I typically get through the campaign in 5-6h on league start, and don't have any issue running labs a dozen or two times for gems.  I expect to be through white maps by end of D1 and into red-tier logbooks middle of D2.\n\nMy current options:\n\nCB Champ : I like tanky and I like clear, but I'm worried about logbook bosses and eater/exarch to a lesser extent since I typically prefer doing these myself.\n\nCoC DD : Looks fun, I don't really have an issue with the labs\n\nBAMA : Also looks fun (I like minion playstyles) but also very meta so acquiring necessary items to get to the power level I'd like may be more difficult?  I also don't know if I need the alt gems to level or which of the alt gems is better yet.\n\nArma Brand recaller : heard that the playstyle may not be for everyone and I'll probably not want to risk it.\n\nTLDR; Want to get through campaign and yellow maps quickly and easily.  Would like to run logbooks and maybe my first two voidstones.  What build?\n\nAny advice?\n\nThanks,",

Also if you invest in mechanics that spam a shit ton of corpses and you are not constantly fighting bosses you don\u2019t need to hit desecrate constantly. I\u2019m a blight and expedition Andy and when taking part in those mechanics I have all the corpses in the world to blow up. Also obliteration is a really common unique that makes it even more fun to play, I love me some chaos pops. The first two-ish hours were a little rough but give your brain time to figure it out. Once you get exposure on gloves and cast speed it will also really help, you\u2019ll have 1 less button to press and you will be cruising. If you have any questions feel free to message me.",
            "I found DD of chaining far worse QoL then regular DD as you need to generate much more corpses. It's far from miserable due to have effective it is and how you become tanky. Not dieing is a lot of QoL",
            "It is if you hate two buttons and isn't if you dont. No different than any other two button build",
            "It's not miserable, it just is what it is.  If you've played contagion/essence drain, or blade fall/blade blast, it's the same thing.  You're just always casting two different spells to do your damage.  If you're used to 0 or 1 button builds, it feels tedious.  If you don't mind using more than one finger, it's really not a big deal.",
            "It depends, I love the playstyle and had a lot of fun with DD in the past. It\u2019s a great build but some people don\u2019t like the two button playstyle. Go in standard and test it to see if you enjoy it",
            "I was wondering the same thing and just did a little test run with DD, having never tried it before. I didn't mind it at all and it felt totally fine to me. The only way to find out for yourself is to try it. Just alternate Desecrate and DD skills with some cast speed and see what that feels like.",
            "Yes. It really is. I tried it last league as a league starter, figuring I would see what all the hype was about. It can be powerful, sure. But man the play style sucks. I respecced as soon as I could to maw of mischief ignite, which was way more fun.",

I would just be concerned with the Ralakesh boots and if they've been made t0 in addition to the nerf.  If not, the full suite should be fairly achievable with Void Battery taking the longest to come down (but they'll get there).  If Ralakesh is off limits then you skip Malachai's Loop, Graven's Secret, and maybe even Badge of the Brotherhood, and just use a second Void Battery.

Everything that has some prolif, or corpse explosion is valuable for blight. \n\nLast league Cremation of Exhuming Necro was very good.",
            "Reap can definitely do fine on a budget although it's certainly not the most (or least, to be fair) new player friendly build out there, and there's a lot less resources out there about it than something like RF with a dedicated content creator. Also as a new player you won't really take part in the \"race\" at start anyway, you'll be taking your time through the campaign and being overleveled solves a lot of issues for many builds.  \n \nI can recommend /u/tfwstarving's build as I used it as my sole character last league and they're pretty reactive in their dedicated thread if you have any question.",
            "So, for a genuinely new player, your real goal here is to make it through the campaign and just sort of check everything out.  How much endgame you actually reach and complete is going to vary based on how much you put in but it's pretty normal to not even scratch the surface in a first league.  What that means is the strength of your build at endgame isn't going to be very important.  By the time you actually need the power, you'll be knowledgeable enough to start a new character or respec your leveled one into something more 'meta'.\n\nWith that in mind, I'd look at Gladiator or Scion.  You start by self-casting Exsanguinate -> Reap until you can use Spellslinger support which you can buy in Act 3.  Then what you want to do is use a wand attack like Kinetic Blast and link Spellslinger to Reap and Exsanguinate.  This makes it so when you attack with the wand, you'll cast the spells too.  The gem Corrupting Fever is actually your main source of damage through all of this.\n\nThis build stacks a lot of physical damage over time, so that's what you want to focus on with your tree and items.  This means increased physical damage, damage over time, damage over time multiplier, and physical damage over time multiplier.  Bleed damage is not useful, but bleed *chance* is.\n\nAs Gladiator, you'll have the ability to make bleeding enemies explode when they die which is why you want that bleed chance.  Scion will eventually get this from a cheap pair of gloves called Haemophilia instead.  Gladiator can also change into Champion and use the gloves.  Another relatively cheap and useful item is Poet's Pen, a wand which has the Spellslinger effect built-in.  You can just put Reap and Exsanguinate into the wand and free up your ability to use other auras.\n\nThis build uses a shield so it's fairly tanky, and it uses its life as a resource so you don't need to worry about mana management.  The single target damage is fairly poor, but your first time through your damage on bosses won't matter as much as learning the mechanics anyway.\n\nOne problem - generally when a character ascends they get an immediate boost of power.  However both Gladiator and Scion get their power spike with their second ascendancy, which means you will have a little bit of a rough plateau until about the mid-campaign point.  \n\nIf you do play through to endgame and want to change into something a little more viable, look into Corrupting Fever Champion for the Gladiator version.  It is a fast easy map clearer in endgame and can do all the story bosses.  It has good defense and can either stick with the wand setup or change into a bow build instead.  The single target is still quite poor, though, so it would not be a great choice against the game's harder endgame bosses.\n\nEDIT:  I don't know if it's changed, but I just remembered - Scion is an unlockable class in act 3.  You get it on your very first go so I completely forgot.  So, Duelist into Gladiator it is!",
            "I would not recommend the skill reap to a new player. I would doubt you have the knowledge or ability to make it feel good. I didn\u2019t really start to learn the game until I played a strong meta build. Doing so allowed me to experience more and more of the game and gave me a chance to start to learn the numerous systems in the game. I would instead look at witch builds and find one you like.  I think one of those would be most similar to Lich gameplay in LE.",
            "Definitely. I've followed Animeprincess's build for two previously leagues. Stay off poe.ninja and follow his build as Poe.ninja is usually saturated with group play Spark carries and this will mislead you. Spark has an inherent advantage for bosses in that you cover an arena entirely with projectiles and preload damage this way. I was able to do this without a Nimis each league. For map clearing it's fantastic as well. Projectiles move fast and you aren't as punished for having to move around like other self cast builds. Also an inherent advantage of spark since your projectiles don't fly straight out. You can move around as the projectiles hit enemies. \n\nAlso exceptional for Sanctum. Small arenas etc. \n\nHieros a great ascendancy granting big bonuses to tank and dps.\n\nCan easily be your only build, run all content, and scale to the moon. You won't boss as fast as ice trap or map as fast lightning arrow but definitely all content viable/farmable.

With Maven it's that she just doesn't stand in your fire trap for long enough to get much damage out on her, and it's a pretty regen-heavy build, so getting clipped by a laser is a great way to die. For Sirus, it's the same as every other DoT build- blinks around constantly, so doesn't stand in fire trap for very long, and he drops any DoTs off him every time he goes untargetable, which is every few seconds in the final phase.

            "I see no reason why it wouldn't still be good. It lost Nightblade which was big, but also not necessary.  You could probably just take Precise Technique for quite a while honestly. The question I'd pose is how far you want to take it and what kind of investment you expect to be able to put into it.\n\nDeadeye will have a smooth leveling experience once you have your second lab (go for chain+proj) and gets a whole chunk of power up front from ascendancy alone.  It can go tri element, chaos, poison, strength stacking, or dex stacking as the main choices and which is best will probably vary based on the new crafting system.\n\nBerserker is by far the stronger one with significant investment but is in no way a starter build.  The paths it has to abuse strength scaling as well as perma berserk are just insurmountable in comparison to Deadeye imo. But you absolutely will pay to do so.  You would either want to start off with something like Rage Vortex or new-Sunder, or still start Deadeye and accumulate strength stacking gear until swapping to a new character when you have good gear and  ~100 div for a few berserker necessities.\n\nChamp is another option and a far safer choice than Marauder on league start. It uses the traditional armor+evasion stacking setup with Perseverance so if you've played any other build like Champ LS or LA, you're in the same ballpark. You can also easily swap to something else with Champ if you don't like VG but it'll be harder as the others.  Overall it's not faster or higher damage than the others, but it will probably be the thickest.\n\nWith VG the biggest thing I want to stress is that it is a melee build on bosses, and the most melee at that.  In maps you have wide coverage but it's Whirling Blade that deals all your single target damage and it puts you close enough to kiss the monster's asshole.

            "Belton on YouTube has a very good video. I modified it a little bit such as if anything is worth 80c I would just sell it instead of keeping rolling for big. This league alts price is kinda high and due to low retention things are moving incredibly slow comparing to the past. Even at the very end of last league pm just kept coming lol and the prices were through the roof. This league prices haven't really caught up with inflation. Rolling on the sides is still okay profit. When people come back next league it will be much more profitable. But even when the market is hot remember not to over saturate the market all at once and undercut yourself. \n\n25% increased effect mage blood flasks moves the fastest. Highest profits are correct mods on corresponding flasks. Such as evasion/armour on jade/granite, movement speed on quicksilver, attack and cast speed on silver,  crit chance on diamond etc. However if there's a good roll it still worth something on off bases. \n\nEvasion and armour can be 55%+ on correct base or 58%+ on off bases. Movement speed/attack speed/cast speed generally needs top roll. Crit chance 50+ and if it's 55 worth quite a bit on any bases. As for the tier of 25% doesn't really matter (some niche cases may allow you to sell more but I personally don't bother waiting for that one edge case). \n\nOther valuable mods are reduced curse effects, avoid being stunned, avoid being shocked, ele resistance. First three all need to be t1. And top roll worth more even though it's not needed to get to immune cap lol. \n\nAs for non mage blood flask 3 charges when hit and t1 recovery, charge on crit are ideal prefixes. For suffix mods tho it's a little different cause for example you aren't going to rely on a non 100% uptime flask to cap your ele resis or stormshroud. And it can't reach any immune cap by the flask itself alone. So the ones worth selling is more narrowed but it's less strict on the tier and rolls cause people starting is going to want a decent flask. It's a bit complicated. Just keep an eye on the  mentioned 3 prefixes and correct t1 mods on corresponding flasks. \n\nAs for what bases to craft on. I mainly target jade, granite, quicksilver, silver, and diamond as these are the most popular. Individual ele resis flask is good too. Amethyst and bismuth I generally avoid. \n\nThis is just my strategy that I find suits me the most where I enjoy alt spamming and taking breaks checking trades doing some lite hideout warrior stuff lol. There's other strategies like ID then dump tab which requires a lot less time in the hideout. Someone else who's more experienced in that might be better fitted to explain it.",

Obviously, always make sure to have normal Multistrike with you or in your stash, in case you get very lucky.\n\nMain barrier is being able to beat the content without extreme slowdown."

I've seen recommendations for just rolling both with glyphic fossils and also essence rolling the burning damage then locking suffixes and either exalting or harvest reforging influenced. However, I haven't really found a consensus on which of these methods (or some other method) would be optimal. I'm looking to turn it into something like the attached image; any levels of burning and conc are fine but I will need all the affixes and an open prefix for benchcrafting in order to improve on my current helmet.

            "Have you tried looking at Pohx crafting guide for the RF helmet?",
            "Burn/Conc is good. But I prefer Burn/AoE. It requires double Elder + Shaper influence. Conc makes your RF smaller. So my dream helm would be Inc AoE, Burning, Horror, 8% dmg conv, and then pick your other perks (life, regen, etc).",
            "I think your best bet is getting burning damage + essence first so your suffixes are done. Then lock suffixes and reforge influence with Harvest. That's roughly 1 in 5 chance of succes.",
            "Yes, but I'm currently trying to go past where the guide stops. Pohx is great but he only goes up to 2 link affixes (horror + burning/conc), saying \"You only need 2 of the 3 Modifiers to have a very good helm. Acquiring 3 is very unrealistic for newer players\". From what I've seen it's the same in his videos, and his build in those has horror+burning. My current helmet already has two link affixes (burning+conc) and I need all three for an upgrade, which adds an extra step at the end to roll conc. That extra step is what I'm asking about. Thanks anyways, Pohx has been a great resource so far!",
            "Absolutely agree that AoE is great, but I'm running level 5 awakened AoE in the sockets. That gives an extra +5% AoE relative to Shaper AoE and -30% from Conc for a net -25% AoE. In terms of damage, Awakened AoE gives +14% more and Conc gives +39% more (at level 20), totalling +53% more. If I were to swap to Shaper AoE I'd presumably run less duration in the socket, which gives 20% more (level 21), so going Conc gives +33% more. POB says that totals to -7,5% Full DPS and -27,5% RF DPS with 3.9m radius for Shaper AoE versus 3.2m for Conc. Personally, I find that my current radius is enough for my purposes, but thanks for the advice anyways, it's a lot easier for me to evaluate the option now that I've calculated it."
