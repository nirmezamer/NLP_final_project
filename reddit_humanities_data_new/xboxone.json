I mean, with the shared libraries across Xbox and PC for many games, it can be hard to justify buying the actual console if you're already set up with a strong PC. \n\nBut, let me tell you, even though the Xbox One doesn't have as many exclusives as, say, the PlayStation 4, it does have some titles that are well worth investing in a console for. You mentioned the Ninja Gaiden series which is phenomenal. Some other games, like Halo: Master Chief Collection, Forza Horizon 4, or the Gears of War series, also offer great experiences.\n\nYou might want to consider Xbox Game Pass as well. It\u2019s a subscription service that provides access to hundreds of different games, including many exclusives, and can be a pretty great deal. Though plenty of those games are available on PC too, but not all.\n\nAt the end of the day, it just comes down to what kind of games you prefer and what your budget looks like.
