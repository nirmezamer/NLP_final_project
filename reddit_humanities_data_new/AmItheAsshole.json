        "content": "#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.\n\nWe\u2019ve been diving into various sub rules lately. So we thought we\u2019d take a break this month, and revisit something we did in an earlier open forum. Hence, the call to ASSemble! (We had a few names that we were throwing around. ASS (Assholes Sharing Stories), Asshole Amnesty Month.\n\nTell us about a time when you were the asshole. We can relax *some* sub rules a bit (a revenge story is probably fine, since you\u2019re recalling, and not asking for judgment). But, other sub rules still apply (no violent encounters, for example)! Let us know about a time when you knew you were the asshole. Maybe you didn\u2019t mean to be, but after the encounter, you realized you were TA. Or, maybe you knew what you were doing, and went through with it anyway! \n\nPersonally, I've always felt the more low-stakes the issue, the better. Those are always my favorite AITA stories, but feel free to share whatever you may have. And most important - have fun with it! \n\n___\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here. Any comments with links will be removed.\n\n---\n\nWe'd like to highlight the regional spinoffs we have linked on the sidebar! If you have any suggestions or additions to this, please let us know in the comments.",

            "Long time ago I was a bartender. Had a couple that came in semi regularly, nice guy, girl was awful. She liked to heavily flirt with other guys when he'd leave the bar. One time he went to the bathroom and she immediately got some guy to buy her a drink and then when BF came back, she cried about this guy coming on to her, won't take no, tried to grope her, etc. BF grabs the guy, but before he could do anything I yelled out she's lying to you. Everything stops, people around start agreeing with me, BF looks around, tells GF they're leaving.\n\nTwo years later I married him, married 30+ years now.",
            "Okay, here's something that still keeps me up at night. I was at a friend's house, hanging out with him and his partner. He and I were both huge fans of a particular TV show, and he dropped into conversation that he'd introduced his partner to it and they were watching through it together. That got us talking about the show again, bouncing off each other about things we enjoyed about it, aaaaand I got overexcited and dropped a massive spoiler for the final season. I realised immediately what I'd done and I was absolutely moritfied. I wasn't invited back :/",
            "I was an AH...but.  When we were first married, we rented a 2nd floor apt from a really nice widow.  I had to park in a small graveled area right by her house, but not on anyone's property.  Couple of the jagov kids tomatoed and egged my car because they couldn't play wiffle ball there.\n\nPut a couple of eggs in my trunk, for a couple of weeks (it was a hot summer).   Went out about 3 am and egged both of their parents cars.  You can imagine the mess.  Heard the parents talking about it, and I chimed in with, \"Yeah, I got hit twice this week..wow!\"",

            "I don\u2019t associate with anyone involved in this scenario anymore so it\u2019s probably safe to come clean.\u00a0\n\nA log time ago I went back where my parents lived for Christmas. We had a double whammy of a day to get through because my parents had a lunch meal for the day, my spouse\u2019s grandparents always did a very fancy evening dinner, and then everyone would convene at a local bar that we had all been going to since before we were legal to enter bars.\u00a0\n\nThings got very rowdy, especially for those of us who had already sat through two Christmas meals with wine and who were now very deep into their cups. But finally the lights came out and it was time to leave.\u00a0\n\nOne of the family members who owned the bar came up to me and took my wine out of my hand. Well to my drunken mind, this would not stand. I lectured him loudly and vehemently about how he had no right to just take my drink and that maybe I wanted to finish it and he wasn\u2019t the boss of me, and I finished up with \u201cWho died and made you Elvis?! You ain\u2019t the king!\u201d He stared at me. Silently poured the remainder of my wine into a roadie cup (this was an area where Togo cups were permissible, as long as the open container was not in a moving car), and handed it back to me. I said \u201coh.\u201d And he walked away.\u00a0\n\nI was mortified for days after.",
            "My spouse subscribed to & shares a ton of posts on Facebook.\u00a0 The kind with thousands of \"likes\". She was still logged on, so I unsubscribed her to several of the more annoying ones.\n\n\nI don't think she even noticed, but it does make me an asshole.",

            "I used to be really terrible about spoiling books for people. To the point where when I got HP book 5 my brother (who was my roommate at the time) had me read it out loud to him. We were fairly rural so it was delivered via UPS late in the evening. I read almost 900 pages to him that night so I couldn\u2019t give away anything. \n\nNow I read books nobody else in my life cares about (free or cheap ones on Kindle Unlimited) or \\*after\\* someone recommends it.",
            "I once had a roommate with whom I split grocery bills. We were on bad terms when I was moving out (kind of an everybody was an asshole situation, although I will hold in my own mind that she was the bigger asshole, but I digress) and so she started going around the kitchen like \"well you ate more cheese than I did, so I get to keep more cheese. You used more flour than I did, so I get to keep more flour.\" That kind of nonsense.\n\nSo I was like oooooooooh I can play that game!!! I had paid for the command hooks, so I walked around the apartment and took down EVERYTHING that we had hung on the walls (a lot of things, mostly hers) and took all the command hooks (leaving her pictures and art and stuff leaned against the walls all over the place). I didn't want them for anything, and ended up donating them down the road, but if she was going to nickel and dime me about flour and cheese she sure as hell was not keeping those command hooks!\n\nHonestly, this was an asshole move and I'm usually not an asshole, but I will die proud of it.",
            "For reporting posts made with **shared accounts** should we just use:\n\n\"Exceeds character limit/Includes screenshot - OP doesn't explain why they may be the asshole\"\n\nWhich *doesn't actually* say anything about shared accounts, but seems to encompass *ALL the other* Rule 6 stuff? \n\nOr is there a better choice?",

It's really hard.  \n\nFurthermore, AITA posts are being used to TRAIN AI to make ethical judgments that would roughly mirror those of humans.

I have discovered a whole world of flavor since we bought our house last year and began cooking at home for the most part. \n\nI am someone who is sometimes unaware of how they are perceived by others at times, and sometimes my filter between my brain and mouth doesn't really work. \n\nI was at a family Sunday dinner with my sisters, dad, grandparents. I was talking about how good a cook my husband is and said, \"I didn't know food could taste this good!\"\n\nMy husband thinks I could be a butthole because my dad and grandparents cooked for me during my childhood, and that my comment could be seen as being really insulting to the food they made. \n\n  \nAITA",

            "Ok, so storm in a teacup AITA from many moons ago.  Back in the days of yore, around 1996 when the TVs had much less p, i or k.  A time where the Playstation had yet to fully decimate the Sega Saturn, a time of hope.  So yeah, a long time ago, so it's going to be a bit vague.\n\nI was about 16-17 and my brother was either 17 or 18.  He could drive, I couldn't (UK driving age is 17.)  Neither of us had mobile phones at this point, they weren't that common.  We went for a quick trip into town to run an errand or two but figured we'd have a quick browse of the game shops and the music/VHS video places whilst we were there.\n\nHe was annoyed at me for something I can't quite remember.  Either I'd forgotten something or bumped into him or accidentally stood on his shoe or similar (I think the latter, some clumsiness on my part.)  Sibling stuff.  We escalate as teenage brothers tend to do, I know I had a couple of pops back, bruised teenager ego and all that, but he just went on and on, wouldn't let it go and ended up getting personal with the insults.  A couple of deep cuts that were just too much and enough to spark a reaction.\n\nI told him if he carried on I was going to go home and he carried on.  So with a \"fuck you\" or similar, I turned around and went to the bus station to get a bus home.  We were walking at the time, he wasn't aware that I'd just turned around and gone.  I assumed he was aware.  My head canon is that he went off on one for a good 30 seconds more before he wondered why I was quiet.  So he spends about 2 hours looking around town for me in a panic.... which is somewhat nice in a way... or maybe worried about getting into trouble with the parentals.\n\nEither way, he gets home, big argument between the two of us.  Fallout was probably some ill feeling for maybe some of the next day.\n\nI know what I'd judge it, but what says the room?",

            "It's not super juicy but one time at my first job in highschool this lady in the drive thru was being a cow and just yelling at everyone to make sure we didn't do anything wrong to her order. I don't understand people who have the sentiment that we screw up their order \"everytime\" but continue coming back. We had one lady who would actually order wrong on purpose to she could yell at us that we don't even know how to listen she's a regular and always gets the same thing. We banned her. So anyhow this other woman is in the drive thru and she's just giving everyone attitude and hollering about \"GO VERY LIGHT ON THE BUTTER!!\" for her toasted bagel. I heard her the first time but since she's being so shitty about it I drowned that Smucker in butter. On purpose. I handed it out the window to her and she said \"did you go VERY light on the butter?!?\" I said yes and she ripped it out and my hand and said \"well it didn't look like it\" I just closed the window on her face and walked away. I told my coworker who was getting most of the heat from her what I did and she spent the rest of her shift panicking the lady would come back and yell at us lol",

I was wired, as I always was after work. Thats why I was playing pool. He would sometimes try to put me off with various kinds of nonsense. \"Scientists reckon that the chance this is all a simulation in 1/3\". I was pleased with my retort: \"Fuck off\"\r  \nBut later, at the bar he mentioned that he had read a paper saying that everyone has taste buds in their ass.\r  \nTrying to stuff your tastebuds into my ass at the bar? Seriously? We'll see about that.\n\n\r  \nHe wrote down the paper and author for me. He had apparently forgotten that I had his work email and had recently written email spoofing software for work.\r  \nSo I did what I feel ayone would at least consider: I emailed the author of the paper from his address, explaining how I tried to put their theory of ass-taste-buds into practice at a high-end restaurant.\n\n\r  \nStuffing the salmon sashimi down my pants was unexpectedly horrible and slimy.\r  \nI shall leave what I did with the garlic aioli and the eton mess to your imagination.

But here, it means that the confession of the OP to being the asshole quickly disappears to the end of the comments thread, where nobody else will reach.\n\nFor AITA, there is a need to differentiate between \"I feel what has been written here is offensive and AH behaviour\", and \"I think what has been written here is irrelevant to the discussion\".\n\nSame applies to a lesser extent for judgements you don't agree with. There's usually a prevailing view (OP is an AH or not), and any dissenting voices get downvoted. Not because they are irrelevant, but because the majority of the commenters disagree.

They're physically identical, to the point where even my parents get them mixed up when we visit, and my wife's parents just call them \"the twins.\" This is extremely frustrating for me, and I don't think it's healthy for them. There are so many people where we live who see two girls with similar features and decide that makes them the same person, which they are not, and I'm beyond sick of it. I'm sick of getting two of everything at christmas and birthdays, even though they have drastically different interests, personalities, and styles. I'm sick of hearing how they're \"creepy\" or look like dolls, or having my daughters referred to as a \"set.\" At their pre-K, the teachers always kept them together, and often called them the wrong names, which apparently led to some critical information being attributed to the wrong child. \n\nI'm done with this. They're going into Kindergarten in September, and I'm enrolling them in different schools. They're both private Catholic schools, similar price range, similar prestige, as much as a kindergarten can have prestige. Elsa has a longer commute in the morning than Anna, but that's the only major inequality here, and honestly, I think the extra fifteen minutes in the car is worth it in order to have my daughters each recognized as individuals at school. If they're not in the same class, teachers don't know them both, students don't know them both, then my girls will each get the same individual attention as any other kid, rather than half.\n\nMy wife thinks I'm setting them up for resentment if one school turns out better than the other, and that I'm being unfair to Elsa by having her commute be longer. I let my daughters choose which school each one wanted to go to, and Elsa chose hers because there's birds on the logo. I get that ideally, it would be great to send all our kids to the same school, but I also genuinely believe that giving them this experience apart from one another is crucial for their social and emotional development into emotionally stable adults. \n\nAITA? \n\nTL;DR: Sending my daughters to separate schools of similar caliber in order to keep people from seeing them as extensions of one another, is this unfair?

            "As someone with a twin sister myself, I totally get where you are coming from. My sister and I were regularly called the twins, called by the wrong name, seen as a set, always had both of us included. This led to major issues in the differentiation process, when we started wanting to be individuals. We also had a hard time learning how to create social bonds as teenagers/adults.\n\nThankfully my school was clever enough not to put us in the same classroom.\n\nThere were tensions because of unequal amount of homework, and friendships, etc. But compared to the times people would confuse us, and not see us as individuals, it was preferable.\n\nThere is no right or wrong answer, but it's definitely healthy to give them space, although it might not always be easy. Be prepared to navigate jealousy and comparison because people will compare them anyway.

Listen to what they voice about the situation after they've tried it. NAH.",
            "NAH. BUT. For future reference it may be worth finding a larger school and enrolling them in separate classrooms. Private schools especially can have wildly asynchronous school year calendars, and you are going to be sad if spring breaks don\u2019t align, random inservice  days off school etc. Not to mention the risk of the kids having music concerts or school plays on the same night, etc. They won\u2019t have any school friends in common so you can look forward to twice the amount of commuting to birthday parties, sleepovers etc. \n\nI applaud you for cherishing their individuality. Other fun stuff like different haircuts, hair color streaks etc can help them help other people see them as individuals.",

It would be an easier decision to support if the schools were more tailored to each individual child than a preference over a logo. I think traditionally this issue is handled by having the girls in separate classes at the same school, so I think you need a particularly strong reason to deviate from that. Especially since you haven\u2019t even tried it yet \u2014 though I also get that\u2019s a decision you don\u2019t want to be making later, so it\u2019s a now or never type of thing.

I'm in my 40's now and I look back at my life and there is a lot of anxiety, depression and lack of overall social skills that I can trace back to my being a twin. We were never treated as individuals, even though my parents did insist on us being in separate classes in grade school we defaulted to having the same friends because if you're friends with one sister why not the other? We became very co-dependent socially and were constantly compared to each other which resulted in extreme depression in my sister and a suicide attempt and by the time we were out of highschool  and we finally did manage to separate and start living separate lives, neither of us knew how to do anything without the other and it was extremely isolating. In my opinion I would have been much better off in the long run if my parents and other adults in my life had seen fit to keep us separated as much as reasonably possible so that we could learn to stand on our own and not rely on the other.",

Personally cannot imagine doubling all that. Also what happens when you very likely realize what a nightmare situation you\u2019ve created for yourself??? One kid has to move after they\u2019ve already made friendships, a routine, gotten comfortable\u2026then you uproot them and throw them in a new school where their sister is already comfortable and confident? That\u2019s going to create more resentment imo. Plus unless you\u2019re agreeing to do all the extra work of commuting and such, you\u2019re the AH and this isn\u2019t fair on your wife who\u2019s against this. I would be too. YTA",

            "YTA for not having your wife involved. Schools are a two yes, one no situation. And for declaring that the girls \"chose\" their schools at five. Your criteria for that is that the child chose a longer commute because of a logo. That is not an informed decision because at five they cannot make informed decisions. However, at five they can answer whether they would like to be together or apart.",

If so, yta for making unilateral decisions about a huge issue (schooling) without consideration for your wife and children\u2019s feelings and points of view. \nAre your daughters ok with this? Who\u2019s managing the logistical nightmare of two separate school schedules/requirements/transportation, etc.?\nThere are far less drastic steps one could take\u2014 different haircuts, distinguishing clothing choices, just TALK with the family about how you could collaboratively problem solve the issue.

It should become less and less as they get older and truly become the young ladies they are meant to be. My mil has an identical twin.  Two totally different personalities.  Her twin lives in another state and also likes to keep her hair short and doesn\u2019t color it.  My mil likes hers long and has it colored. But you can not tell them apart when they talk.  They sound identical in every way.   I have accidentally called her sister before thinking I was talking to my mil.  They were fine growing up.  They have an extremely close bond despite the distance.  Make sure you aren\u2019t hurting that bond.  This also should have been a mutual decision with your wife.",

The school wanted to keep me back a year. Parents said it would look bad to have the twins separated. We also had to do the same activities (even if I was bad and hated it). And my mom would love to say twin A is naturally gifted and talented and twin me works hard at what she gets. Imagine listening to that growing up really makes you feel good \n\nOnce they have grown a bit and have a better idea of who they are as people maybe they will change and want to go to the same school.

In the different schools I worked at the policy was not to place twins together, it\u2019s very important that they develop as an individual and learn to work/learn/thrive independent of their twin.

I'm also going to assume that you didn't actually call them Elsa and Anna. \n\nI have identical twin boys (19 months) and I'm already thinking ahead to school. The preschool that we have used for our older kids, and will be using for our twins, has a policy of keeping siblings in separate classes (to help with individuality from a socialisation perspective), but I'm not sure how achievable that will be with the twins as one of the drop off times clashes with the primary school time. The primary school has 2 classes for each grade, so I will be insisting on them being kept in separate classes.\n\nAs for the people around you, you may not like to hear this, but they're being too lazy to put in the little bit of effort that it takes to tell them apart. I have been around numerous sets of identical twins throughout my life (none related to me, mine are the only multiples in my family history) and the only ones that I couldn't tell apart were the ones that I didn't spend time with. My parents see my twins daily and like yours, occasionally mix them up but mostly have it correct. My in laws live hours away and will double check that they are calling them the correct names at the start of video calls. My BIL (lives in another country) has only met them in person twice and still gets it right most of the time. Our friends are the same. This is because they all make the effort to treat them as individuals instead of 2 halves of a pair.",

Not because the schools are different, but because with kids they will perceive differences.  And it could be worked out by having the kids in different classes.  I suspect that your choice will lead to unintended consequences both negative and positive.\n\nStill, if you guys are on the same page, it\u2019s a parenting choice and yours to make and done for the right reasons should be as ok as any other parenting choice.\n\nHowever, I am saying YTA, because you are completely glossing over your wife\u2019s - I assume mom? - concerns and are clearly not 100% in agreement.",

You\u2019re changing your children\u2019s LIVES because you feel irritated. Take a step back here dude. Also have you even asked the girls how they feel? Do they not want to go to school together? Having a five year old choose their own school (based on logo) seems irresponsible. \n\nAlso in terms of their relationship you\u2019re going to make it less by separating them. They won\u2019t have one another to rely on in new environments or stand up for each other if someone\u2019s picking on them etc. Also a simpler solution is to just have them in different classrooms. In grade school I had my cousin (1 month apart) and we were always in different classrooms. In middle school same thing cause I was in honors and same for high school. But the best part was that outside of class (recess, lunch, electives) I could hangout with her and we grew up incredibly close since we were also family.",

However we were in separate classes by the time we got older. It's okay since at least, we still get to participate in school events and we always have each other's backs.\n\n Yes, there were comparisons sometimes, but I think what helped us the most is that we were never compared to each other at home. My parents never did it. When we talk about our differences at home, it was never about who's better or lesser. So we don't really mind what other people say about us in relation to each other because we have such a strong bond.\n\n We were already in college when we separated schools and after hearing about what my other classmates went through without a close sibling while schooling, I was thankful to my parents that they sent us to the same school and became each other's best friend.",

Lucky enough to also go to catholic private school from kindergarten to 4th grade, and they actually separated us there - there were two classes for each gender every year - which allowed us to have some individuality, but once that stopped and we started going to public and charter schools, we were immediately lumped together again. I also got the delightful privilege of being the ~lesser~ twin from about 8th grade onward, to the point of being referred to as \u201cthe other one\u201d by a TON of kids in my freshman year of high school. It was horrible for my self esteem and created a strained relationship between the two of us up through our early adulthood, when they moved and settled in LA, while I\u2019ve kind of flitted around the entire country and am currently east coast, simply due to the fact that we can BE individuals without being immediately lumped together. I think this is an incredible idea and kind of wished my parents would\u2019ve had a similar thought.",

Basically, to avoid potential separation anxiety, twins are kept together until they start grade 1, then they are always put in separate classes to allow them to form a different personality. Does their current school have a similar policy?\n\nHowever, the fact that critical information is being attributed to the wrong child last academic year is concerning. Have you started by speaking to their current school about your concerns here and the need to put them in separate classes? That would be the easiest first step, but if they refuse, then I do t see anything wrong with your solution. It\u2019s important both for their education and their social-emotional development that they are allowed to be different people and are given appropriate support for their learning needs, which means being able to attribute needs to the right child.",

My sisters are now 44 and the level of toxic comparison and competition is astounding. They fight about everything. They competed over guys, the size of house each had, the number of children each had. Whether one had daughters or sons. Their weight. Their grades. For my mothers attention. This has gone on from the moment they were born and continues to this day. They are insufferable and neither has matured and both are alcoholics. After my mother passed almost 2 years ago now I stopped having anything to do with either. They also have no friends or social skills. I truly think had my parents deliberately tried to give them each their own identity that they would have stood a chance. They won\u2019t be 5 forever and if it ever gets to the point where they really want to be together then you can do that. But for now, I think it will give them exactly what you are aiming for and that\u2019s their own identity. This one decision will likely impact their entire development for the better. Great job!",

They're physically identical, to the point where even my parents get them mixed up when we visit, and my wife's parents just call them \"the twins.\" This is extremely frustrating for me, and I don't think it's healthy for them. There are so many people where we live who see two girls with similar features and decide that makes them the same person, which they are not, and I'm beyond sick of it. I'm sick of getting two of everything at christmas and birthdays, even though they have drastically different interests, personalities, and styles. I'm sick of hearing how they're \"creepy\" or look like dolls, or having my daughters referred to as a \"set.\" At their pre-K, the teachers always kept them together, and often called them the wrong names, which apparently led to some critical information being attributed to the wrong child. \n\nI'm done with this. They're going into Kindergarten in September, and I'm enrolling them in different schools. They're both private Catholic schools, similar price range, similar prestige, as much as a kindergarten can have prestige. Elsa has a longer commute in the morning than Anna, but that's the only major inequality here, and honestly, I think the extra fifteen minutes in the car is worth it in order to have my daughters each recognized as individuals at school. If they're not in the same class, teachers don't know them both, students don't know them both, then my girls will each get the same individual attention as any other kid, rather than half.\n\nMy wife thinks I'm setting them up for resentment if one school turns out better than the other, and that I'm being unfair to Elsa by having her commute be longer. I let my daughters choose which school each one wanted to go to, and Elsa chose hers because there's birds on the logo. I get that ideally, it would be great to send all our kids to the same school, but I also genuinely believe that giving them this experience apart from one another is crucial for their social and emotional development into emotionally stable adults. \n\nAITA? \n\nTL;DR: Sending my daughters to separate schools of similar caliber in order to keep people from seeing them as extensions of one another, is this unfair?  \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You bring up valid points for wanting them separate, but there are also valid reasons to want to keep them together.\n\nI know they're only 5, so they're still too young to really understand all of this, but have you tried involving them and letting them make their own decisions when appropriate? Like... Do you let them show the differences in their personalities stylistically? Maybe Elsa wants to wear her hair one way and Anna prefers another, or maybe one prefers pants and the other prefers dresses? I know private schools are often pretty strict on dress codes, though. Or have they said anything about it bothering them?\n\nThere's not really a clear right answer here. My first thought would be to maybe just wait longer before making a big move.

Even though now that we're in college we chose to stay close and have the same friend group we were given the space to grow in our own spaces.

Like it or not this will shape their lives (as much as being an oldest of 12, an only child, a middle child etc.) Surely they\u2019ll have some unique hurdles due to their status as twins, but that\u2019s the life they were given.

You can divide and conquer but there are bound to be hurt feelings and extra hassles. Those schools probably play each other in sports too so that could be hard.

I went to Preschool with a set of identical twins and the parents sent a note each day IDing which twin was wearing which outfit. I also went to camp with identical twins and the only way to tell them apart was their earrings(one wore purple studs and the other dangling green[they also switched to mess with people once but that\u2019s a different story lol]). You have to think about what sending them to two schools could cause(two commutes which means leaving earlier in the morning, two pickups, potentially school events clashing which could cause more resentment than being known as \u201cthe twins\u201d). Maybe you could request that they have different teachers/different classes so they can have that sense of independence/individuality without it being so drastic.\n\nEdit: two of my best friends growing up were fraternal twins(to the highest extent they didn\u2019t even look like they were related lol) but they despite never being in the same class we\u2019re still referred to as \u201cthe *blank* twins\u201d.

I got away with it though because that particular class was particularly challenging in terms of its make up. It went from barely literate to kids who got moved into the advanced program the following semester, as well as lots of different social, emotional and psychological challenges to manage. It was ultimately better not to leave any group together for too long, otherwise issues would arise.",

So I'd talk to the principal about separating them into different classes if that's an option.\n\nAs far as the family treating them like the same person and giving them identical gifts, what I did that  FINALLY got through to my in-laws with the cousins on that side was giving their 4 boys, from 12 to 6 years old, all the exact same gift one year for Christmas. (It was roblox gift cards.) The oldest and youngest didn't really play anymore, and when that was pointed out to me, I said something like \"oh yeah I guess I should have thought more about what they each like\". It was kind of a petty move, but they got the point. And now we all ask every year what the kids are into. \n\nBut some people will always treat them identically just because \"twins\".

            "NTA - I\u2019m not a twin. I was married to an identical twin for almost 12 years. They were easy to tell apart if you looked for their differences, but most people couldn\u2019t. Their entire lives they had the same haircut, identical clothing, both shared classrooms, and even shared a car when they started driving. They absolutely could not function independently and when they each started dating at the same time, they really latched on to that person and we all ended up married at very young ages. \n\nI do remember conversations of frustration at always being the pair, and one twin thrived more than the other (also the same twin that got to choose the car, the haircut, etc.) but the complaints were not often. I remember him feeling extremely guilty when we went on vacation for the first time without the other twin. He was absolutely miserable. The other twin started prospering in life and there was some definite FOMO from the one that wasn\u2019t. But they were always thick as thieves and covered for each other even during extremely poor decision making moments that were life changing. \n\nThey are still best friends and get together every weekend if possible. They didn\u2019t really have other friends growing up and finally settled into a routine of their older siblings\u2019 friends being considered their friends too. \n\nAnyways, I do feel like their lives could have been drastically different if they had ever been identified as individuals. They still aren\u2019t and they are in their 40\u2019s. One is favored over the other and they both kind of carry a chip on their shoulder, but the favored twin does a little less I suppose. \n\nI tried hard when I was in their lives to treat them individually but their family thought it was very strange of me to do so. They certainly never considered how different they could be. Somehow most of the time, even without speaking on the phone or planning ahead, they would show up to family events wearing the same thing. If one was inside and the other was outside and I walked through they would often both be humming the same song. They would share dreams even and find out later on when talking about them. They would eat the same meals and discover it later on when they were talking. Idk if they still do this or not.",

My sister and I get along great now, but growing up as a twin was such a struggle since we went to the same schools, had the same classes, and had the same friend group (was a small community). It was not easy to learn how to socialize and express myself outside of my twin when we basically spent 24/7 together. Actually, I think that our relationship greatly improved when we finally moved out to separate colleges. In college, for the first time I had to learn how to navigate through the world alone, which was honestly anxiety inducing at such an older age. Allowing your daughters to forge their own separate paths early, I believe will only broaden and enrich their experiences, especially since it will only give them more to share with each other!",
            "Yep NTA as a twin I love the fact that you acknowledge your children have different interests and personalities. Until I was damn near 14 my twin and I would get THE SAME presents from everyone other than our parents except I was labeled the blue twin and my sister was the pink. We aren\u2019t even identical twins and the pressure still applied. My mom always had us put in separate classes so we could form our own friends and identities without the pressure of being the twins/so we wouldn\u2019t depend and on each other and be too scared to make friends. So I saw if the schools are too small to have separate classes per grade, then I think you are doing what is best for your kids, if they decide when their older that they want to attend school together then that\u2019s a conversation for the future but I think at this young of an age when identity development is so important, you are doing the right thing by allowing them to be their own people.

I never once enjoyed playing that instrument.\n\nI also \u201cchose \u201cnot to go to French school. \n\nMy parents definitely had the best intentions, but they lacked the responsibility you need as a parent to make decisions that you think are in the best interest of your kids.

            "I went to a very small public school and there was only one class per grade. There were multiple sets of twins at the school and the only choices were to keep them in the same class or as one set of parents chose to hold one of the kids back and have them wait a year. Neither were good options. \n\nI\u2019m a fraternal twin, sadly my twin died when we were very young. I\u2019ve wondered how my parents would have reacted in this situation as the local school was the only one in the area and there weren\u2019t any private schools.",
            "I\u2019m surprised at all the people who say their school has a policy of separating twins. All the schools I\u2019ve worked at have had policies of keeping twins together unless they/their parents ask to separate them - because of the research that supports keeping them together until they are ready to separate.\n\nI don\u2019t know how a teacher could possibly mix twins up in their records unless said twins are deliberately trying to confuse them. If I sit down to benchmark a child\u2019s reading progress, it doesn\u2019t matter if they look like another kid in their class - I call a kid\u2019s name, we talk about what they\u2019ve been reading, then read together - those kids would have to be making a significant effort to pretend they were the other. Their individual work has their name on it \u2026 it would be a bit easier to mix kids up in prek when they don\u2019t always write their own name, etc \u2026 but if you can learn a few dozen kids names and get to know them as people, you can tell kids apart who look alike based on their different interests and personalities. When you have identical twins in a class, you end up making doubly sure when you\u2019re talking to one that you know which one you\u2019re talking to, but it usually doesn\u2019t take long to figure out who is who without asking every day and making notes about who is wearing what.",
            "It seems like OP is projecting. Perhaps there was a time in his youth when his individuality was not respected. Separating two kinder aged twins is really extreme. It's a physical divide that ensures they need to stand out apart from their twin to make their parents acknowledge one over the other. \n\nI know three sets of twins. One set was inseparable and loved being twins. Another set made it a point to let people know that their sibling's interests should be recognized. They did that for each other. The other set just kind of figured out their individuality in high school and wanted to experience living in different countries for college. \n\nAll of these people made their own choices. OP says he dislikes how they are treated like one set because they have no say, but he is also taking away their power to decide by controlling the course of their relationship instead of letting them decide.",

One of them now has her own set of identical twin girls and the other has boys who are only a year apart. \n\nThey were placed in separate classes all through elementary and still remember how they hated being separated. They are women with their own lives and different personality husbands but their love for each other and closeness are a huge part of who they and their families are. At one point, about 10 years ago, one twin was working as a chef and the other twin took a part-time kitchen job with her because twin one was having anxiety. And twin two was a pharmacy technician. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThe baby set - lol - start Pre-K this year and will be in the same classroom.

They will give an emphatic \u201cI not [other twin] I [own name]!\u201d And they are very protective of each other\u2019s things. If I can\u2019t find A\u2019s water bottle, it is not an acceptable solution to share B\u2019s. If someone hands them the wrong shoes or the wrong water bottle or the wrong backpack, you will be told off. They share most clothing but not outerwear, so good luck if you try to put the wrong coat on one of them.\n\nBut with all of that, they do not like to be separated. When one had to go to the hospital, the other asked where he was every 5 minutes, knowing full well where he was - my brother came to babysit and twin B informed him I had to take his brother to the hospital (as if he didn\u2019t know that\u2019s why he was here) and then proceeded to ask my brother repeatedly where Twin A was after I left. I once had to pick up something in my car that required uninstalling a car seat, so I put one of the twins in my brother\u2019s car - and they both screamed the whole way home.\n\nWhen they get older, they might tolerate being apart more, but if the pattern holds they would probably tolerate a different classroom but not a different school.",

They go to a very small school with only one class per grade so separate classes was not an option unless we went the separate schools route like OP.  However, the kindergarten teacher told me from our first meeting that she wouldn't put twins in the same table groups.  The first grade teacher similarly kept them mostly separated.  I have picked up a child and lunchtime and then picked up the other child later from the after school program and had them look around my car confused and say \"Where's my sibling?\"  This has happened with both kids.  They didn't notice their sibling was gone for hours even in the same room.  For my kids being in the same class has been helpful because when one only writes down part of the homework instructions or one doesn't understand something that's not familiar to me, usually the other child can help.

One twin would be in a group doing writing (for example) and the other would be in Building. \n\nAnother family with twins used to do a rotating roster. Three days a week, both twins would be in.

            "I have identical twins. I make them each their own birthday cake (smaller ones) - this year one wanted raspberry and one wanted orange - but no way I\u2019d do two birthdays. We don\u2019t really do kid birthday parties though, we just have a family party, so two different cakes is enough, at least right now. A bunch of people in my family were taken aback, and said that it was too much work. I just said that they are two different people, and if they had two different birthdays they\u2019d have two different cakes - it\u2019s the same amount of work, it\u2019s just all at once. As soon as I said \u201cwell they are two different people\u201d most of them realized that it wasn\u2019t over the top or ridiculous, it was just treating each of them like an individual.\n\nI\u2019m not sure putting them in two separate places is the best way to help twins, though. Mine are very young (only 3 so maybe they\u2019ll outgrow this) but they won\u2019t even lay down in their beds at bedtime if the other twin isn\u2019t in the room. I had to take one twin to the hospital last week and his brother asked where he was every 5 minutes.\n\nIMO, helping them assert their individuality when they are together is the way to go.\n\nFor example, when people say things like \u201cI can\u2019t tell them apart, they look exactly the same\u201d I say \u201cyeah, you will have to get to know them to tell them apart.\u201d I don\u2019t always dress them alike, but sometimes they want to look the same. More often than not they will have the same pants and different coloured shirts, or the same shirts and different coloured pants. When people ask me how to tell them apart, I always talk about how their personalities and interests differ.\n\nI don\u2019t mind answering when people ask \u201cokay, who is who\u201d but when people ask how I know, I tell them it\u2019s really obvious because they are two different people. People often want visual cues but that\u2019s too bad, that\u2019s not the best way to identify them. My twins also correct people when they get called the wrong name, in an amusing combination of cheerful indignation. No one could spend 5 minutes with them and come away with the impression that my twins will tolerate being misidentified. I can tell people who is wearing which shirt but there is no guarantee they won\u2019t switch at some point \u2026 \n\nMy question for OP is, how do the girls feel about going to two different schools? How do they feel about starting school without the other there with them? Because in all honesty, it\u2019s selfish for OP to separate his daughters if that\u2019s not what *they* want, because he doesn\u2019t want to have difficult conversations with family members or teachers about how their behaviour is inappropriate, and how they are harming the twins by conflating them as one person. I could be wrong but I don\u2019t see anything in the post to indicate that OP has actually openly addressed his concerns - just that he\u2019s sick of it happening.\n\nI know I had to have conversations with my family early on when they would ask about appropriate gifts for my kids because they were 3 months premature, and I thought it was important for people to understand that first birthday gifts would need to be things meant for 9 month olds, not one year olds. Because one of my twins had an infection in NICU - he was septic, he coded - he ended up essentially developmentally a month behind his twin brother, and had some additional development issues and delays, so even things that were appropriate for my one twin, the other wasn\u2019t ready for yet. But especially in their first two years, they had completely different therapy goals, so the kinds of toys and gear they needed  to support their development were very different. At 3 the differences still exist but are more subtle, and they don\u2019t tolerate getting different things anymore - they want the same things, but we will see how long that lasts.\n\nI think OP needs to sit a bunch of people down and remind them that twins are in fact two different people, and if you aren\u2019t going to treat them as two different people you aren\u2019t going to end up having relationships with them - not that they\u2019ll be cut off or anything, just that no one really wants to have a deep meaningful relationship with people who don\u2019t acknowledge their personhood. It\u2019s one thing to need help identifying who is who at the start of a visit, and another thing entirely to pretend they are the same person because they look the same and you can\u2019t be bothered to get to know them as individuals.\n\nEvery family is different, it\u2019s not that it\u2019s inherently wrong to separate twins or anything \u2026 it just seems to me that there is a significant risk here that OP is creating a stressful situation for two little girls just to make his own situation more tolerable, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair. Also, as far as the girls\u2019 relationships are concerned, yes they\u2019ll have separate friends and separate teachers and people will get to know them separately and won\u2019t be able to treat them as a set at school - but it won\u2019t change that once people see them together, it might still be difficult to tell them apart. It\u2019s much easier to tell twins apart when you know *both* twins. I went to school with three sets of identical twins, and I\u2019ve also taught a few sets of twins as an elementary school teacher - the way to tell twins apart is to get to know them.",

I grew up regularly 'sharing' a birthday party (strictly just family, we couldn't afford anything more) with one or more of my cousins.

The ones I never see together, I find it harder because I tend not to make note of the contrast as much when they\u2019re not directly compared. \n\nThat being said, I also think some twins choose to be more alike and spend more time together than others.

            "You are correct. We had our fraternal twin boys in different classrooms, but they often took the same tests as the teachers in their grades cooperated, so there still was a direct comparison. Of course, this can't be avoided 100 %. For example, one of my boys was slower in learning to read, and as you practice reading at home, this of course crops up.\n\nBut for me, it was more a social question because even in preschool, one of them was more outgoing and sporty while the other was more reserved. Because people tended to see them as a unit, the reserved one got invited to birthday parties of kids he wasn't really friends with, things like that. I didn't want either one of them to hold back because he thought he needed to protect his brother. It worked out fine, they grew up to have very different personalities and career paths, but still like each other and will do things together. Just normal siblings, not forced closeness because they happened to be born on the same day.",

I wouldn\u2019t of known how to anyway and the idea with lots of training is at you meant to start at Young and stick with it. after I got kicked out of Suzuki violin when I was around 14 for not practicing (to that date the happiest moment of my life), I was made to go to private lessons for year before I could finally quit. Unbeknownst to me until this year. My brother also hated his instrument and was forced to play it until around the same year, which sadly means for years longer for him.\n\nBut my point isn\u2019t about that story. My point is that nobody should say that a five year old \u201cchooses \u201c something like a school  etc. it would\u2019ve been different if I loved classical music.

In another, they just put them with different teachers in the same elementary school. Two separate schools seems a bit overkill. It's important to recognize them as separate people, but I would argue that being a twin is probably part of their identity as well. Imagine being 5 and trying to convince your classmates that you have a twin and...there's no twin. And most importantly, what do the kids want? Op, just be careful that you're not projecting your adult feelings about this onto them. Some of the things that bother you may not bother them at all.",

Both girls get their own birthday cake (they both like chocolate) but decorated the way they want, sometimes it's been mostly the same other times incredibly different. They're bigger now and I know they've discussed about whether to do individual parties or not, but so far the girls are adamant to keep their celebrations the same because they like having giant parties instead of two small ones and it's sorta a tradition now. From being on the outside observing, my friends try super hard to recognize both their differences and how special it is that they're twins. They've never dressed them exactly the same, maybe sometimes the same outfit but in different colors and never force them to do the same things but if the girls ask to do the same things they don't stop it. From my perspective it looks pretty balanced. \nI'll admit, if we were to have twins, I couldn't do the matchy-matchy thing. I would have to do different names and different colors/outfits. Coordinated but not the same if that makes sense.",

Sometimes family members drop by for a separate, casual dinner if they\u2019re free. As the kids get older, they usually combine a small outing with friends (4-5 kids) at the skating rink or something with a family dinner. I think it\u2019d make sense for twins to share a family dinner and go on separate outings with a small group of their friends for their birthday.",

Because I (not a twin) feel like if I *were* a twin I probably would want my own celebration, especially if my interests and friend group were different from my siblings, but it does seem like a potential logistical and financial nightmare. Or if I were a parent to twins, I would want them to have an individualistic experience too so they know they're seen as two separate people. \n\n\n\nAfter thinking on it for a minute, I wonder how difficult it would be to try and plan a single yet split party - like they each get their own cakes, they each invite their own friends, a dedicated space for each with of them with different themes and decorations to their individual liking. It wouldn't be impossible to do, but it would still be a big undertaking and you'd need a location that's big enough for both. I guess if I were doing it at my own home, I would really hope that one kid would prefer their party to be outside while the other would prefer inside because that's much easier to keep separate lol. Or maybe have two small event tents to pop up in the backyard, one on each end of the yard, and a common area between so all the kids could intermingle if they want. But then you have the potential issue of the parent maybe spending more time with one party/kid than the other, and that could cause resentment and jealousy, and it could still be a whole big mess. \n\n\nEssentially, it's doable - but sure as hell wouldn't be guaranteed to be easy.",
            "My son had three sets of twins in his class when younger (small school so only one class per year group), and they wore uniform (now they have moved up to senior school with six classes per year group I don't think they are in the same class at all,\n\nOne set - T wore a watch F didn't, another both wore glasses but had different colour frames and the other (according to my son) had different faces (looked very similar to me)",

They are a replica of my in-laws, my son looks exactly like FIL and daughter like MIL. They don\u2019t look like siblings at all.",
            "Yup. Not a twin, but I\u2019m one of four kids. We all went to a summer camp with a bunch of Finnish people, so for some reason there were about 6 pairs of identical twins for around 160 people. I spent years with these folks and all of the twins were units, no matter how different they were from each other. \n\nMy siblings and I sort of had our own relationships due to the age difference. I still wish I had gotten to know all the twins individually, but as a child they were a unit to me.",
            "Yea, of all the identical sets of twins I've met and got aquatinted with there's always a handful that you truly can't tell apart unless you've known them forever. \n\nFor example, a grade below me there was a set who had opposite (left-right) birthmarks on their arms, but in different spots so you really only had to look towards the right to know who you were talking with (and if you could remember!).",
            "What was in your water?",

Their way completely backfired which is very stupid.",

Whose stank socks are these? Are they white or black?! lol worked for us. They\u2019re older teens now and we still have colour coded stuff.",
            "I color coded my four kids as well. Red, blue, green, yellow, and then the nieces that visit are purple and aqua. Most of them still prefer their assigned colprs, but I tweaked their stuff to be their favorite shades. My oldest child ended up liking a dark pink/lavender more so most of their stuff is that now.",

            "We did color coding in my mom's house but it was mainly like hangers and towels and stuff. There was such a a difference in age between my sister and I that by the time we got to be the same size, I was a teen and she was an adult and we had to help with laundry so we would all be in my mom's room, grabbing our stuff to fold or hang up.",

Learning their individual tone of speech, physical habits like hair twirling/nail biting etc is genuinely easier it just takes time.",
            "I grew up with multiple sets of twins.   \nThe person you're replying to is correct. People get hung up on physical image, but in reality there are still visual cues to tell twins apart. You do have to get to know them, but it's not hard to learn. Body language, micro expressions, the way they move--it's rarely 1:1. Within five minutes, you can tell Twin A from Twin B. As well, even identical twins have subtle differences.  \nWith the twins I grew up with, you could always tell J from B because J had a very dark freckle by his right eye, and B didn't.  \nE had a slightly more slanted eyelid than her twin L.  \nF's hair was straighter than N's curls.  \nIf you actually pay attention to people, it's not that hard to identify which twin is which.",

My son wasn't even 7 days old before I called him the name of one of our dogs. Their names are nothing alike except they both end in an \"it\" sound. That immediate belly laugh after having a c-section did not feel good in the moment.",

He swears he will be taller than me. I'm like duuude, you are 27. You are not growing anymore. LOL I'm 5'7. \n\nMy twins are the same. My daughter is more assertive, so my son does not like doing certain things, and he won't speak up. His sister is all like, \"Hold my beer,\" when this happens.

            "Our dogs are Daisy and Jojo and I routinely call them the wrong name, despite purposely avoiding an -ee sound at the end of Jojoms name.

It\u2019s been a huge source of stress for her and there\u2019s been multiple incidents where she attempts some crazy diet (in 6th grade while at a sleepaway camp for music she didn\u2019t eat for a week except for a few granola bars). She\u2019s at a point now where she\u2019s a bit more accepting of her body and isn\u2019t going to do anything reckless, but we have to be extra careful to not mention weight stuff around her because it makes her upset. \n\nI really want to emphasize that she doesn\u2019t eat anything more than what other girls her age eat, and if anything she eats less. She\u2019s had doctors walk in the room and tell her that she\u2019s \u201creally big for her age\u201d and girls at school saying similar. My daughter is at a loss of what to do, she exercises and eats healthy.\n\nAnyways, my mother pointed out at dinner 2 days ago that she was \u201ctubby\u201d and she suggested that I put her on a pill and sign her up for weight watchers or a similar program. Ever since then she\u2019s been texting me with \u201cresources\u201d and I got so mad at her refusal to stop that I told her that she should check out some of those resources because she wasn\u2019t looking so skinny herself.

I was never overweight, but it didn't stop mean comments from older women in my life about how my diet would eventually catch up to me.\n\nA lot of it is internal jealousy and self-resentment, but it's actually  fucking crazy for a grown grandmother to recommend her minor granddaughter for diet pills and such?!?! Good on you OP. \n\nBut also, be aware that sometimes intentionally avoiding conversations around food or weight can become painfully obvious to your daughter. Really, the best course of action is to speak to a nutritionist, or a doctor and have blood work done: there's a myriad of reasons for this. And if there's nothing, and it turns out she's just genetically disposed to carry more weight, she can *still* be extremely healthy. \n\nOne of my girl friends in college is quite severely overweight and is extremely healthy, a power lifter, and unlikely to experience major health issues anytime in the near future. She just happens to be naturally fat, and that isn't bad or ugly at all. \n\nBody positivity, or glorifying obesity *isn't* the answer, but ignoring the conversation forever won't help either.

I would take your daughter to see a Gyno familiar with hormone imbalances etc. In fact, trans affirming doctors like my Gyno *have* to have an even more extensive knowledge base.\n\n*Note: Hormone blockers and injections were originally created to help naturally intersex individuals, especially those who had been \"corrected\" by their parents and doctors as infants and children. None of what I'm saying here is to push that the child is trans or should under go a medical transition.*\n\nMy younger sibling is on an iron supplement and a birth control that regulates their periods so they actually have a regular cycle and it corrected their ovulation issues as well. Because their testosterone created these issues for them. They have broader shoulders, larger bust, wider hips, and have always been \"big for their age.\" So, throughout childhood they got heavily sexualized and bullied for those things. They also always smelled worse than I did and needed stronger and stronger deodorants throughout puberty and now into their adulthood, again.\n\nAll of that simply because they have higher testosterone levels in their system.\n\nNow, because afab and amab individuals both produce estrogen and testosterone (remember, babies start out female until the SRY gene signals the embryo to produce the male sex characteristics), that's my first suggestion to take a look at. Because it genuinely can save your daughter a lot of grief to get some insight from people who know their stuff and general physicians, sadly, don't need to know the finer details. They need to know the basic \"What can we eliminate\" things, and they cannot make a determination or diagnosis about hormonal issues in the same way, and I believe that will best help your daughter to understand her body type and her needs. \n\nMy younger sibling eats healthy, does everything right to control their weight, but is still bigger because of their medications, their hormones, and they have EDS which makes exercise really difficult for them. (EDS is a series of comorbid connective tissue disorders and diseases, it is not endometriosis). \n\nI don't know what your daughter may have, but I do know that there's more to why some people can and cannot lose weight. Starving is not the tactic, eating less is not the tactic. But, potentially, if she can find something concrete to blame for the weight, she will see a new way to tackle her weight issues or find a way to love her body knowing *she* is not at fault. \n\nBest of luck to you both!",

I understand why, but it always undermines the main point you\u2019re making. I see it online and in real life all the time: people debating over an important topic, one person throws out a personal insult, immediately the topic shifts to that and the important topic gets lost. It also immediately suggests that the person doing the insulting had no more points to make so they resort to personal insults. \n\nIn this case, the point was that your daughter is healthy and your mother needs to stop interfering. \nAs soon as you mentioned her own weight, that\u2019s now become the point, that\u2019s all your mother will take away from the conversation and the point about minding her own business where your daughter\u2019s weight is concerned will have disappeared. \n\nIf you want a point to have impact, it needs to be your only point.\n\nEdited to change a word (silly autocorrect)",

She\u2019s been a bit curvier than other girls since she hit puberty at age 10. It\u2019s been a huge source of stress for her and there\u2019s been multiple incidents where she attempts some crazy diet (in 6th grade while at a sleepaway camp for music she didn\u2019t eat for a week except for a few granola bars). She\u2019s at a point now where she\u2019s a bit more accepting of her body and isn\u2019t going to do anything reckless, but we have to be extra careful to not mention weight stuff around her because it makes her upset. \n\nI really want to emphasize that she doesn\u2019t eat anything more than what other girls her age eat, and if anything she eats less. She\u2019s had doctors walk in the room and tell her that she\u2019s \u201creally big for her age\u201d and girls at school saying similar. My daughter is at a loss of what to do, she exercises and eats healthy.\n\nAnyways, my mother pointed out at dinner 2 days ago that she was \u201ctubby\u201d and she suggested that I put her on a pill and sign her up for weight watchers or a similar program. Ever since then she\u2019s been texting me with \u201cresources\u201d and I got so mad at her refusal to stop that I told her that she should check out some of those resources because she wasn\u2019t looking so skinny herself. She told me to fuck off and then she blocked me, and left me wondering if I\u2019m the AH in this situation?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But I never appreciated people giving me weight loss advice that I was literally already doing but because they didn't know who I was. Thank you for protecting your daughter. Sounds like your daughter has already tried and who has time for weight watchers and stuff at that young age. A perspective from your daughter's is that she already probably hears alot about it at school and doesn't need her family mentioning it all the time too.",
            "NTA at all! I\u2019m proud of you!!!\n\nI was always average until puberty, then went up to 140 and couldn\u2019t lose it. I was highly active and dieted like crazy and only drank water and it didn\u2019t matter. I had severe cramps all over the month, not just around my period, and sometimes they were super strong. I got used to it, until I passed out at the mall at 17. I had a cyst that covered more than 50% of my ovary, and it turned out I had severe PCOS and my ovaries were covered in scar tissue-we monitored my ovaries every time I had pain for a couple months, and they were constantly getting cysts, swollen, irritated. The pain I was feeling was real.\n\n\nIt turns out, weight gain is *really* common with PCOS. Your body has increased insulin and stores fat longer, so diets and exercise aren\u2019t helpful. \u00a0If I had known that, I wouldn\u2019t have tortured myself with so much diet and exercise, especially when I was in pain and feeling so terrible, pushing myself through it because I thought I was weak.\u00a0\n\n\nYou made the best choice supporting your daughter and turning the mirror back on your mom. If your daughter seems to have pelvic pain at random, maybe make an appointment with her PCP to discuss. They can run some tests and help her get on medication that will help regulate things so it doesn\u2019t interrupt her life. Birth control helped me a lot because it regulated my hormones-they may go in that direction. I lost 30lbs in 6 months once I started ortho-tricyclin lo. Good luck to you and your daughter-she\u2019s a special girl to have such a great mom!!!",

Get her blood work done as soon as you can. Find a doctor that works for your hours. In the meantime, go on walks or bike riding. Find some physical activities that you can both do.

You and your daughter are much better off not having to deal with her until she learns to be socially appropriate.\n\nMy mother used to tell a story about my grandmother (her MIL).  My mother has been curvier all her life.  Gram was, shall we say, \"comfortably cushioned\" herself.  Gram lived in MN.  After my parents and I moved to TX (where Mom's family is from), Gram came down with my aunt and uncle to visit.  As soon as she saw my mom, Gram said \"Honey, you look great!  Have you lost weight?\"  In fact, it was August and my little brother was due in late October.  My grandmother almost died of embarrassment at her faux pas.  My mother could laugh at it because she knew that my grandmother was from a generation which believed that the nicest thing you could say to any woman was \"You look great!  Have you lost weight?\" She knew my grandmother didn't mean anything hurtful but was, instead, trying to pay her a compliment, even if it was somewhat ineptly done.  My mother always looked forward to her MIL's visits and even drove up to MN to help her move into a senior citizen's apartment when Gram decided to downsize.  Mom had no doubt that Gram loved her three DILs and all six of her grandkids and her great grandkids as well.\n\nGram was different from your mom because Gram never suggested Mom needed to lose weight or told her how to go about it.  As for her own size, Gram said she was under tall (she was 5'0\"), so she didn't have the frame to spread out all of her fabulousness (her sister was almost 6' tall and rail thin, so there may have been something to Gram's argument).  She also said she carried extra weight in an effort to provide her own insulation to stay warm in the MN winters.\n\nHug your daughter and tell her you're sorry her grandmother is clueless.  As long as your daughter's weight is not negatively impacting her health and there is nothing in her health that is causing her to carry the extra weight, let it ride.  I'm at the top of the weight range for someone of my age/height.  Ironically, I developed diabetes at age 35 in spite of being on the light side back then (125 lbs. at the time) and eating healthy.  Why am I at the top of my weight range?  Because I work out and muscle is heavy.  I'm also 5'4\" (shortest in the family since Gram passed away) and have (well-toned) curves.  I don't work out to lose weight.  I work out because it gives me time to outline short stories or just take a break from thinking about anything at all.  My doctor is happy with my A1C and we've had to cut back on my meds.  Like I say, if your daughter is healthy, don't fix what isn't broken.",

Constant abuse like this leads to eating disorders.\n\nI know others have brought up a potential medical condition and I agree that you need to look into that as soon as you reasonably can do so. I also wanted to bring up a medical condition that is not very well known and is often written off as obesity, though it can happen to people of any size. It's a connective tissue disorder called lipedema where some of your fat cells stop working properly. These diseased fat cells change in a way that makes them turn into nodules that continue to grow and no longer respond to diet or exercise to get smaller. They just keep getting bigger no matter what you do. Where the lipedema is located follows a couple of different patterns so is very similar for each person who gets it. It mostly impacts women and has a hormonal component where it often starts or worsens during puberty, pregnancy, menopause and when taking hormonal birth control. The lipedema is often painful, bruises easily, and makes the limbs feel heavier as well as some other symptoms. \n\nThere are some conservative treatments that can help slow it down and keep it better under control. There is also surgery that can be done to remove the diseased fat and nodules. Unfortunately there are not a lot of doctors familiar with lipedema currently. But here is a link to a webinar by a doctor who specializes in lipedema if you are interested in more information on it. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/9O5e-V_VC2Y?si=cD-BTG7uoTmV1JQf",

It's possible the daughter has seen a GP and was told it was just 'puppy-fat' or that she needed to watch her diet and exercise.\n\nUnless OP outright states that things have been severe enough for a doctor for years, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. We don't get told many details, and I'd rather think well of someone who turned out to be an AH, than assume a struggling single mother doesn't care about her child.",
            "Exactly! It took me 16 months to get a diagnosis for endometriosis. The doctors and ED treated me like a pill pusher, told me it was cysts, said it was stomach cancer, had no idea why I was doubled over in pain, then I got my diagnosis...  Then I fought with my insurance for a full hysterectomy so I could live without pain.\n\nIt took me three years and four doctors to get an answer about my thyroid. First doctor told me to lose weight and to \"lay off the snickers\". I was heavy but couldn't lose weight to save my life. I was weighing my foods, working out, and moving around a lot...\nSecond doctor just wanted to monitor. Third doctor was worthless. Fourth doctor ordered almost every blood test from how it felt including a tsh antibody test and that's what alerted her to my thyroid issue.  \n\nMy daughter has the same issue as I do but her thyroid is okay so we are looking at other possibilities that could be causing it.\n\nIt's sad and ridiculous how patients aren't listened to.  I don't think many people experience the issues with fighting for a diagnosis/answers because it's not easy when something goes wrong to be heard let alone get it treated.",
            "Omg especially if OP is a POC, a lot of doctors put it off as the parent is lying about diet and exercise, or the girl is just going through puberty, or whatever other excuse other than actually making sure the kid is okay. Ideally they would treat everyone like a VIP patient but that's just not how it happens.",
            "Sorry for my comments to you. I had sincerely read her saying the exact opposite, and I'm very tired of people ignoring what efforts parents do put towards getting their kids treated because they expect more. That had me responding very triggered and aggressively. I'm sorry for that. \n\nNow I'm not able to find the thread she was responding to and someone else has double checked things as well. Her saying she'd gotten inconclusive results was what had inspired me to make my initial comment and reach out to her, it's even why I said that general physicians don't know the finer details etc. But it's genuinely not there and I have no idea what's happened.",
            "When I was reading her comments earlier she'd said the opposite. I've also reached out to her in DMs by now, maybe that will offer some more clarity.",
            "That's very weird to me. It was because of that comment I'd written mine to begin with. It literally made me think \"Okay, so she's tried these, but has anyone looked at her daughter's hormones yet?\"",
            "Sorry I must have missed that. \n\nI'm assuming everyone worked that out because of the age and details in the story?",
            "Idk where you live, but in HOC and high populations, doctors appointments can definitely run over 2 hours. \n\nAnd no, unfortunately not everyone is guaranteed sick days. And some people are unable to access e-consults.\n\nSorry, I'm not trying to excuse the mom. Just trying to offer another perspective as someone who was the child with the hormonal imbalance that caused life long issues including weight gain. I was fortunate to have two working parents with good jobs that allowed time off. Others really may not be so fortunate. Genuinely, you should meet some of the poor parents in places like Miami.",
            "I doubt the ten year old is like 5'6\"+ and even if she were the adjusted kids bmi is still in the obesity range.\n\nEdit: my mistake, 15yo. Still wish I knew the height tho.",
            "I was that at 15 and due to my height I was still in a healthy bmi",
            "My daughter is 5\u20197 is 14 and weighs 150. She\u2019s still got a baby face so looking at her you might think she\u2019s chubby but when you see her in a swimsuit she doesn\u2019t look overweight just athletic.",
            "That's not how it works.\n\n150 lbs for a 15 year old girl is not A LOT. I weighed about the same at 15, and 160 lbs at 17,and it's that kind of mentality that was really damaging. You can't account for muscle mass, bone density, health. Anything. Especially when young bodies are still growing. I did all the sports, ate normally, and was fit and healthy. But because that number was \"A LOT\" for a 15 year old girl, I developed eating disorders and obsessive exercising to try get it down. \n\nI'm 32 now, 140lbs, and I could do with gaining weight. The eating disorders thankfully got under control, but the body comp that had me always looking a little softer and rounder just fell off me around 25-27. \n\nThe number is just one of many variables. Everyone is different. Puberty is weird. \n\nOP should still get her kid tested for peace of mind, but seriously, growing bodies are not adult bodies and all bodies have different points at which they operate the most efficiently and healthily.",
            "Fine, I'll reply. \n\nScheduling is an absolute nightmare for a lot of things in Healthcare. Some places, you have to schedule bloodwork at a separate facility with a referral. Many parents find it easier to schedule in the morning, or after lunch, so they can simply take a half day off work,  which may be easier to negotiate.  \n\nWaiting until summer also makes sense because you don't have to deal with pulling the kid from school for a partial or full day as well. \n\nSome jobs do not have flexible scheduling, either. You can't just take off with minimal notice for most, unless it's a true emergency, and some still penalize you for that. She is doing her best to balance it.",
            "Primary care doctors don\u2019t usually work on Saturdays. Urgent care will be open but they aren\u2019t really equipped to handle this.",
            "I would hope it wouldn't but if op is a single parent it might be hard especially if they are in the US because some jobs won't give you the time and you lose the insurance if you lose the job. OP should definitely find time to do it as soon as possible but, unfortunately some jobs don't give 2 shits about anything but you being there.",
            "The average diagnosis delay for endometriosis is something like 7 years, which is how long it took for my kid.\n\nIt took 8 years for me to get treatment for a chronic cough. The doctor I saw at about the two year mark said, \u201cIf it persists, come back and see me.\u201d",
            "I just double checked, and in the comment OP stated that she suspects thyroid or pituitary issues bit hasn't  taken the daughter to do bloodwork. She might do it this summer depending on her work schedule. Sounds like pcp gave her a blood work order and she  hasn't gone to have it drawn yet.",
            "Let me rephrase: everyone can call in sick. I have called in sick to take my dog to a vet. I get that it is not a long-term solution but imo I would personally never risk it.\n\nI get that situations differ but sometimes, priorities need to be priorities. There is often help/arrangements available. On top of that, Op mentioned none of the hypotheticals you throw up here.",
            "Please go reread the post and realize that this is about a 15 year old.",
            "I have a 10 year old that's as tall as I am. I'm 5'5\". So it's possible.",
            "She is 15.",
            "She's 5'4",
            "This so much. I\u2019ve learned over the years that my body just doesn\u2019t function well below 150, but my happy stable place is 162-165. Was 150 at the doctors office this week, and suddenly clicked why I\u2019ve been feeling so run down and lightheaded all the time",
            "Girls are also done growing by 15. So if a girl is 5\u20195 weighs 150 but consistently stays at 150 well into adulthood that\u2019s pretty healthy.",
            "She's put this off for YEARS. No, it's not that hard.  You do what you need to get it done.",
            "An urgent care would be able to order and run tests but sometimes they take longer than a GP to get tests back.",
            "I don't know how it is in the US, but other people seem to agree with me that OP is an ass for not taking one day off. It's one day, I don't know if people in the US get fired for not being in for one day to take their damned kid to a doctor that could save them a shit ton of trouble down the line. You can talk to the others and ask if they're from the USA for input on that but otherwise, why risk having your child be in pain because of work? It's stupid.",
            "Well thank you for double checking that. I was also looking and I've lost even the thread I saw her responding to when I was reading earlier. Her comments on her account aren't attached to the pfp I kinda remember of the person she was responding to, which I mostly remember had a lot of red in it.\n\nThis is the most confused I've been about Reddit comments since I first made my account. It *was* there, but now there's just her saying she hasn't taken her daughter in yet?\n\nThanks again.",
            "What I'm trying to say is that no, not everyone can call in sick. The vast majority of people cannot call in sick. \n\nIt's VERY privileged to think that everyone can when that's not the case at all. Many people call in sick and lose their jobs. I've seen it happen and I've had to quit a job during COVID because of it. \n\nSo to insinuate that it's so \"easy\" to do so or that \"everyone\" can is presumptuous at best, and again-privileged at worst. \n\nRegardless of what you consider \"hypothetical\", that is a real fact for many people all over the world, especially in the US. She stated she had work and is obviously concerned and has been taking her to doctors. You don't know what that all entailed.",
            "Not everyone can \u201ccall in sick\u201d. Really.",
            "My mistake. Even so though, danger zone is dependent on more than just the scale number, and suspecting a problem but refusing to take a day to test is being a poor fiduciary for your child.",
            "Definitely not. I didn't stop growing until I graduated.",
            "And maybe she didn't have the money or didn't know until recently that it was something she needed to look into, or was told initially to hold off because it was early puberty and could level out with growth spurts, etc.",
            "OP has waited five years\u2014I\u2019m thinking a few extra days won\u2019t matter. \n\nThat said, everyone has different experiences, but I\u2019ve had my bloodwork results on my portal next day after urgent care visits.",
            "Having the great misfortune of working and living in the US I can confirm there are places like this and I've worked for some. It's honestly terrible but  if you can't afford to lose your job it's a rock and a hard place. Now if op doesn't have that issue they are definitely the ahole for putting it off but I'd want more info because he'll you get jobs that won't even accept doctor's notes for being sick because you were \"well\" enough to go to the doctor so you were \"well\" enough to go to work. It can be crazy.",
            "No problem :) I just don't understand how a parent isn't on top of this when an issue could be potentially time sensitive."

        "content": "My(23f) family went out for dinner a few days ago to celebrate my sister(26f) Jenn's birthday. When we got to the restaurant Jenn was already there alone. She said she told her boyfriend Blake the time got pushed back 30 minutes because she needed to talk to us alone. Jenn was mad at Blake for not getting her any birthday gifts and only took her out to dinner to a place they go to often. Our parents understood her being upset and she asked if they would try talking to him because she couldn't get Blake to understand how hurtful that was. I asked her if she had given him her usual 'present' for his birthday or last holiday and Jenn said that wasn't important.\n\nFor context, my sister's idea of a gift for her partner is lingerie and sex, and only ever that. I don't know about her past relationships but I do know in the 2 years they've been together, I've heard and seen Blake give her gift ideas for him and he winds up buying them for himself after the fact. He's come to Christmas at our house with gifts for Jenn and Jenn always shows up empty handed for him saying she'd give him his present later.\n\nI told Jenn it sounded like she got as good as she gives whereas our parents said I should be concerned someone would be dismissive and vindictive toward my sister. Our parents said they'd think about talking to him based on his behavior when he arrived. So I text Blake that Jenn was setting him up for a lecture. \n\nHe wound up not showing up. Last night Jenn called me angry. She saw my text to him and realized my text was the reason he canceled and accused me of not having her back and she's told our parents I butt into their relationship but I figure she was trying to get us involved in her relationship anyway. I probably could have just stayed quiet but at the time it didn't sit right with me what she was trying to do. AITA?",

She has no moral high ground to object to her sister also meddling. In fact, if you had meddled in her favor, she'd have been really happy about it. \n\nYou did the right thing in warning Blake about the three-person ambush.",

            "NTA-She pulled you all in her relationship and then wanted sympathy when it wasn\u2019t warranted. Your sister doesn\u2019t sound like relationship material for Blake. Kinda self-absorbed. You did right to warn him ahead of time. The only thing I wonder is why he felt it important to share your text with her?",

            ">but I figure she was trying to get us involved in her relationship anyway\n\nNTA. Jenn already lied to Blake about the time of the dinner, and she doesn't consider what he might need or want for a birthday gift. They don't really sound long-term compatible. I think you did the decent thing in giving him the heads-up, although he should still have attended. Your parents sound like they indulge Jenn, and she has therefore never learned to take the consequences of her own actions.",

As you said,\n\n> she got as good as she gives \n\nAnd if she finds that hurtful, then maybe she can finally realize that Blake also finds it hurtful.

Why does your sister think it\u2019s ok to put on some lingerie and offer up sex as a gift for her boyfriend but when they essentially do the same thing she gets butthurt and then drags your parents into it.

One doesn\u2019t have to buy things, making an effort to show you care could suffice for someone.  It\u2019s the thoughtfulness of a gift, whether it is a material or act of service. I guess it goes with her views of a celebrating her partner, she gives sex and they give her fancy gifts. It\u2019s so extremely transactional and shallow. Then she tries to ambush him with her parents? What is she, 12 years old?! Her actions have consequences, she should prepare herself when he breaks up with her.",

It\u2019s a cowardly tactic. \n\nAnd you were right - she was already asking you to get involved in her relationship. She\u2019s just pissed that she gambled and didn\u2019t agree with her.",

Your sister has been nothing but dismissive towards Blake.  I don't think he's been vindictive.  I think he feels that there's no reason for him to invest time and effort in giving thoughtful gifts when Jenn doesn't do the same.\n\nI hope you can remain friends with Blake once their relationship ends.  I predict it won't last much longer with your sister's attitude.  By always giving lingerie and sex, she's basically sending him a message that he should be grateful he gets to have sex with her.  I can hear it now.  \"Thank you for my Christmas sex.  I think I can hold out until my birthday six months from now.  I really, really appreciate it.\"\n\nBtw, were you raised by the same parents?

Lane looks around at everyone, then asks \"Ricky are you dead?

When we got to the restaurant Jenn was already there alone. She said she told her boyfriend Blake the time got pushed back 30 minutes because she needed to talk to us alone. Jenn was mad at Blake for not getting her any birthday gifts and only took her out to dinner to a place they go to often. Our parents understood her being upset and she asked if they would try talking to him because she couldn't get Blake to understand how hurtful that was. I asked her if she had given him her usual 'present' for his birthday or last holiday and Jenn said that wasn't important.\n\nFor context, my sister's idea of a gift for her partner is lingerie and sex, and only ever that. I don't know about her past relationships but I do know in the 2 years they've been together, I've heard and seen Blake give her gift ideas for him and he winds up buying them for himself after the fact. He's come to Christmas at our house with gifts for Jenn and Jenn always shows up empty handed for him saying she'd give him his present later.\n\nI told Jenn it sounded like she got as good as she gives whereas our parents said I should be concerned someone would be dismissive and vindictive toward my sister. Our parents said they'd think about talking to him based on his behavior when he arrived. So I text Blake that Jenn was setting him up for a lecture. \n\nHe wound up not showing up. Last night Jenn called me angry. She saw my text to him and realized my text was the reason he canceled and accused me of not having her back and she's told our parents I butt into their relationship but I figure she was trying to get us involved in her relationship anyway. I probably could have just stayed quiet but at the time it didn't sit right with me what she was trying to do. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If I called my parents and whined like a child that a guy that I was dating didn't get me anything for my birthday, and would they talk to him?

I personally don\u2019t understand why you would really text her bf at all, but especially not to \u201cwarn him\u201d (unless you\u2019re super close and text regularly anyways). Some might say that Jenn put you in the middle of it, but you are always the decider of how you react to externalities\u2014 no one else. We\u2019re you trying to add to the drama of the situation or prevent it? I think getting to the root intention is important here. \n\nAs for your sister, she\u2019s def an AH. First, why is she not getting her bae gifts, but expecting some. My bf and I don\u2019t really buy each other presents because it is not either of our love languages, but occasionally even we partake in gift giving\u2026 If your man drops hints for gifts then that is his love language and if she really liked him she\u2019d respond accordingly\u2014Same with him. She\u2019s complaining that they are going to somewhere they go all of the time, but unless she is celibate with her BF 364 days a year, then giving \u201cher gift\u201d on his birthday is literally a reoccurring event\u2026\n\nSecond, ambushing your partner is crazy and If my bf did that to me I\u2019d be pissed\u2026 and he\u2019d be pissed if I did it to him as well. Would she like to be ambushed on what is supposed to be a fun event? No probably not. I think she must be an unhappy person if she rather gang up on someone on her birthday rather than feel good during it. \n\nFinally, your sister and her BF do not seem compatible for a few reasons. A) Jenn seems a little selfish which doesn\u2019t really work in long term relationships fairly. B) her bf seems to not care too much about the relationship if he\u2019s just going to skip the celebration without even talking to her about it first. He might be fed up with the situation. C) it\u2019s never a good sign to me when someone complains about their partner to their loved ones\u2026 if you truly believed you would be with this person long term you\u2019d want your family to like them just as much as you do so you would paint them in a better light. \n\nXx hope everything works of well for everyone Xx\n\nPS: your parents enabled this behavior xD",

She hasn't nearly as enthused with the other gifts.\n\nShe has been complaining to me since about how dogshit that gift was. She was basically like.. A crock pot? I could buy that myself. What kind of gift is that?\n\nSo yeah, she takes gifts seriously. I don't know what she got her brother, but she bought me concert tickets, which is a pretty big gift to give someone. \n\nBut I don't get her hatred. This is her brother. Yeah, they're close. A tight-knit family. But it seems like a fine gift to get from your brother? \n\nI said my sister gave me a coffee machine once, and she said that was a really bad gift and lacked thought/origniality. But I thought it was fine? I needed a coffee machine and she bought me one. Great stuff.\n\nBut yeah, she was complaining to me again tonight and it's been like... a week since her birthday.\n\nSo I told her I don't get her hatred for the crockpot. It's something she uses everyday, and she should be more grateful that her brother took time out of his day to get it for her. I mean, he's a student and doesn't have much money but bought her something she needed.\n\nShe did not like what I said. She said no way in hell she's going to be grateful and that it's a bad gift. She said if I want to accept low effort gifts, that's my business, but she's not going to be grateful.\n\nShe has been mad at me since this happened. AITA?\n",

It also sounds like she over values the gifts she buys for others, and that might be because she over values the time and thought she puts into gift selection and gift buying. This makes me think that being good at gift selection and gift buying is kind of part of her identity. If that's the case, then she's offended because she feels like other people are not valuing her for who she is. And if that's the case, then her hatred is a means of protecting herself and her identity.\n\nMaybe you could approach her on her level - talk to her about something that you do, something a bit weird but harmless, something that's part of your identity. Make it clear that you understand that this weird thing is your weird thing and that other people don't have to do this weird thing in order to value you for who you are. So hopefully you would be able to draw parallels between her gift selection and gift buying thing and your thing, so that you can both talk about how other people can value a person for who they are and still not do things in the same way or to the same extent.\n\nIf this situation gets worse, I would suggest professional therapy.",

She said it's the main way she shows she loves someone. In the love language test, she would be acts of service I believe.\n\nHer birthday was last week and I got her a gift she loved, thank god. So liked all of our gifts basically except her brother.\n\nHer crockpot cracked, so her brother bought her a new one. It was a nice one, too, but I could tell the second she opened it she hated it. She hasn't nearly as enthused with the other gifts.\n\nShe has been complaining to me since about how dogshit that gift was. She was basically like.. A crock pot? I could buy that myself. What kind of gift is that?\n\nSo yeah, she takes gifts seriously. I don't know what she got her brother, but she bought me concert tickets, which is a pretty big gift to give someone. \n\nBut I don't get her hatred. This is her brother. Yeah, they're close. A tight-knit family. But it seems like a fine gift to get from your brother? \n\nI said my sister gave me a coffee machine once, and she said that was a really bad gift and lacked thought/origniality. But I thought it was fine? I needed a coffee machine and she bought me one. Great stuff.\n\nBut yeah, she was complaining to me again tonight and it's been like... a week since her birthday.\n\nSo I told her I don't get her hatred for the crockpot. It's something she uses everyday, and she should be more grateful that her brother took time out of his day to get it for her. I mean, he's a student and doesn't have much money but bought her something she needed.\n\nShe did not like what I said. She said no way in hell she's going to be grateful and that it's a bad gift. She said if I want to accept low effort gifts, that's my business, but she's not going to be grateful.\n\nShe has been mad at me since this happened.

Literally BOTH of the scenarios you describe come under the category of \u201cthis person knows me and thought about me when they came across this\u201d- the person who gifted you the $100 jacket cares about you to the extent that they listen to your (to you) insignificant ramblings of your daily life. I\u2019d argue a trinket based on your hobby would be a much less thoughtful gift since that requires a much more surface level knowledge of your likes and dislikes. \n\nAppreciate the people who care about your daily mundane life. Everyone is capable of catering to the more interesting aspects of you as a person but very few care about our meaningless daily ramblings. They care about your daily comfort more than they do about grand gestures. Perhaps changing your perception to think of this may help. I have received many birthday gifts over my life but one of the most special ones have been a set of coloured scarves as the gifter noticed I like to match scarves to my outfits. That highlights a greater level of closeness- they care about the everyday you.",

I have a running list somewhere and I know I\u2019m forgetting some of the best (worst) ones.\n\nMy fave is how carefully packaged they are with bubble wrap surrounding the items and the box always has like an entire role of duct tape around it as if she expects parcels to just explode open while in transit if not properly secured\n\nShe loves me a lot, there is no doubt in my\nMind, this isn\u2019t passive aggressive gift giving, though the high number of single itemd that should come in pairs perhaps should maybe give me some cause for concern that she\u2019s sending me a message hahab\n\nShe always include some sort of drawing supplies which is something I always need and like, which is sweet of her, but the bad gifts are far more fun!",
            "Yes, my MIL goes to discount stores and gets things for my daughter or me and it\u2019s pretty much junk. Clothes that are too small, not my style (even my husband laughs), not good quality (rip after one use), or toys that are cheap and not safe for a 2 year old with small pieces. My daughter will open everything and then doesn\u2019t care about any of it. So then it goes to the garbage.\u00a0",
            "The only gift I ever complained about was when my brother gave me a framed copy of his bands cd. I still to this day believe it was just something he had lying around and went \"oh crap I need a gift for my sister this will do\". But even then I still thanked him for it. I appreciated the effort even if it was minimal. But OP's gf is an AH. He thought of what she would need and gave it to her. Be grateful for the gift.",

            "if you have enough duplicates, throw all the duplicates together and maybe donate them, or try to sell them to a second hand store as a set of baking accessories!! since they\u2019re from temu donating might be the best bet, but you\u2019d at the very least wouldn\u2019t be just throwing out the duplicates cluttering up your kitchen, just passing it along to another potential baker :) either that, or if you have kiddos who have shared an interest in baking, give it to them so they have their own set. \n\ni don\u2019t think i\u2019ve ever complained or hated a gift tbh. maybe it was bc it\u2019s been instilled in me to always be grateful for what i\u2019m given no matter what, but i\u2019ve only ever really been a little bit disappointed with a gift. confused however\u2026yes. christmas of 2022 i sent an amazon link to my grandma for my wishlist and one of them was what i thought was a pack of 3 of butterfly neon signs. i told her i knew it would it come in a pack of three so i\u2019d take two and hang them up in my room for me and my sister, and then give the other one to my other sister to hang in her room. (yes absolutely my whole thought about wanting that gift was to share the entire time lol). well christmas day comes around, i get a nice makeup organizer, a nice small adidas backpack that i still use to this day, a few other things, and then i opened the butterfly packs. the look on my face when i opened up the wrapping and inside there were **8** packs of the butterfly signs, was a mix between \u201cwhat the fuck\u201d and \u201cwhat the hell am i gonna do with this\u201d. never ended up using all 8, but i suppose the rest could just be given away \ud83d\ude02",
            "I think this might be it.  Someone who feels like they're always cooking and cleaning might feel insulted by a gift involving cooking, no matter how much she needs it.\n\nOne year for Christmas, my mom got my sister and I Dyson vacuums.  My dad gave a freaking disclaimer before we opened them that it wasn't his idea.  We were both happy but I can see it going the other way.\n\nNTA but OP needs more information.",

            "I love gift giving as well, definitely my love language in the way I express it (not sure my favorite receiving), and the gift I will constantly smile the biggest over is my ex\u2019s mom gifting me Mad Libs every year. I never told her I liked them, but she thought it seemed like a \u201cme\u201d gift, and I cried when I got the first one because it truly is such a me thing to get. Simple things that make me feel thought about, simple things that make me think of others, those are the perfect gifts to share.",
            "Precisely. It's how she rates the gifts she's given as low or high effort that's the issue here. Not sure if her assessement qualifies as 'Love language'. Like OP said, just being grateful for receiving a pretty well-thought out gift is what's missing here. Not sure what GF was expecting from her brother.\u00a0",

Everyone in her family really likes to cook, actually, and it\u2019s always been a bonding thing for them. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nI think It\u2019s just what she said. She finds the gift low effort and uninspired. She told me if I ever got her a gift card she would be pissed because there was no thought put behind it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTo explain more, she kept saying that all he did was remember she needs a crockpot, go to the store, pick up one up he knows she likes, and that\u2019s all the effort he went to for her birthday. She said it took him like 5 minutes to do and good gifts aren\u2019t 5 minute pick ups, etc. Of course that isn\u2019t how it seems to me, but that is what she said. Thank you!",
            "Exactly.  Don't laugh.  It's not funny.  It's serious.  \n\nAnyone who shit-talked a gift I got them, that would be the last gift I ever got them.  I'd also probably not want to spend much time around them at all, ever.  Let alone live with them and make a life with them.  You sound young and you probably don't know any better, but this is not how it's supposed to be.  Break up with her, like, yesterday.",

I personally think that\u2019s beautiful. I did not say you are being irrational. I said that the opinion of the entire \u201cits a matter of\u201d paragraph in your original comment is needlessly reductive and makes no sense. \n\nThe person who heard that your coffee machine broke and got you a new one hears you talk about your daily life, and they thought of you when they saw a coffee machine in a store and knew it would actually help you out in day to day life.- this is what I meant. Thinking of it like this might help your perception and perhaps be more happy those those gifts. \n\nMy tone may have come across as a bit harsh and I apologise for that, but that\u2019s the core of my argument. The daily use gifts are no more or no less a signifier of \u201cit would make me happy\u201d than a trinket.",

I'm old enough that those two are starting to intersect at times lol. \n\nI was mostly just surprised the brother even knew her crockpot broke, but maybe she has a habit of continuously complaining about lots of things \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
