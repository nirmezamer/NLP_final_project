        "content": "\nThe Sri Yantra (\u201csacred instrument\u201c) or Sri Chakra (\u201csacred wheel\u201c) or Mahameru [3D] is a yantra (instrument or machine) formed by nine interlocking triangles that surround and radiate out from the central (bindu) point, the junction point between the physical universe and its unmanifest source.\n\n\nOn August 10, 1990, Bill Miller, a pilot in the Idaho Air National Guard, noticed a huge etching on a dried-up lake-bed while flying over it, in Oregon State of the United States.\n\nThe massive formation was a quarter of a mile in width and was etched 3 inches deep into the surface.\nIn his earlier round about 30 minutes before Miller first noticed the glyph, there had been no trace of this formation.\n\nNeither had any of the other pilots of the Idaho National Guard (who regularly train over this corridor), observed any unusual activity or a design-in-process in this area.\nThe etching simply appeared that morning. There was no possibility of any of the other pilots having missed such a prominent formation in process of being made.\n\nThus the natural Shree Yantra formation has been seen in Oregon, United States of America. During August of 1990, a pilot in the Idaho Air National Guard noticed a huge etching while flying over on a dried-up lake-bed in Oregon. The massive Shree Yantra found in that dry lake bed of Oregon was 23 kilometres long and was etched 10 inches (or 25.4 centimetres) wide and 3 inches (or 7.5 centimetres) deep into the surface. There were no tire marks or any sign which could suggest that any human had made it. According to the pilots (who regularly trained the area) \u2013 neither the design was ever seen earlier in that area prior to this nor they observed any design-in-process or any unusual activity in that area. There was no possibility of any of the other pilots having missed such a prominent formation in process of its creation. Later, the design was identified as the ancient Indian meditation tool called \u2013 the Shree Yantra.\n\nAccording to the officials this Shree Yantra had appeared supernaturally. This was way back in the 1990s when technology was not so advanced that such a huge Shree Yantra can be etched without leaving any signs of construction. But it can be said that it could be one of the reasons behind America\u2019s wealth and progress\n\nLieutenant Bill Miller of the 190th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, immediately reported the details of what he had spotted to the authorities at the Air National Guard \u2013 a 13.3 mile glyph of lines about a quarter of a mile in width and length, on the extremely hard, sun-baked dry bed of a lake in Mickey Basin located southeast of Steens Mountains in the Alvord Desert, 70 miles away from the city of Burns in Oregon.\n\nThe formation detected on the morning of August 10, 1990 was oriented precisely in the North-South direction. The glyph had a machine like precision in its shape and clarity of lines.\nAfter Bill Miller reported the observation, the news was concealed from the public by the authorities for thirty days.\n\nThe news hit the media in the United States on 12th September, 1990 when Boise TV station first aired the story. As soon as the story was aired, the glyph was quickly identified as the ancient Hindu meditation device- the Sri Yantra- identical in shape and proportion, and in its geometrical properties. No one had a theory why a pictograph of a complex Hindu meditation yantra should appear in the wilderness of Oregon. The story caught the attention of the media and the viewers alike.\n\nBy September 14th, the story was picked up by the Associated Press, Bend Bulletin and the Oregonian. The Oregonian reported that some architects that had been contacted by the newspaper, had said that the cost of conducting a land survey alone, before such a project could be initiated, would range from 75,000 to 100,000 dollars. The Sri Yantra design has a degree of complexity and a level of symmetry that makes it difficult to recreate its design even on paper, let alone furrow an enormous replication of it on a dry lake-bed. There was therefore a good deal of speculation that the glyph was not man-made.\n\nThere were other reasons too to support this theory \u2013 not the least important of them being the fact that, the shape produced by the lines in this massive Sri Yantra at Oregon, could not be deciphered while standing on the ground. In fact, the shape only made sense when viewed from a height of a few thousand feet above.\n\nIn Vedic texts, the Sri Yantra is defined as a device formed by nine interlocking triangles. Four triangles point upward (representing Shiva) overlapping with five downward-pointing triangles (representing Shakti). The triangles are placed in a circle surrounded by the two levels of lotus-petals, which in turn are surrounded by an outer circle and enclosed in a tantra design, serving as a protective cover. As the devotee enters into the Mandala, represented by the Sri Yantra, he leaves behind the worldly distractions and conflicts; and is transported into a world of symbols and visualizations.\n\nThe triangles surround and radiate out from a bindu point. The bindu represents the junction point between the physical universe and its un-manifest source. The nine triangles are interlaced in such a way so as to create forty three smaller triangles symbolic of the entire cosmos.\n\nThe Sri Yantra is variedly described as a visual representation of the sound \u2018Om\u2019 and an expression of the philosophy of \u2018Advaita (one-ness or non-duality)\u2018. The Sri Yantra is popularly used today in India as a meditation device.\n\nTwo UFO Researchers, Don Newman and Alan Decker, visited the site on the morning of 15th September and reported that no trace of tire track markings or foot prints were visible anywhere close to the site even though their own station wagon had now left quarter inch deep marks into the hard crust of the surface along the track from where they had approached the formation.\n\nDr. James Deardorff, a Research Professor Emeritus at the Atmospheric Science Department of Oregon State University and a colleague of Don Newman and Alan Decker, compiled the details of their investigations and forwarded the story to UFO magazine, a British magazine devoted to the subject of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and extraterrestrial life. The magazine had an international reputation for quality and authenticity and agreed to publish the story which appeared in Volume 6, # 3 in 1991 under the heading, \u2018A Symbol on the Oregon Desert\u2019.\n\nDr. Deardorff wrote in his investigative story that the government had not been able to give a reasonable explanation to the public as to how a glyph of such a large size had made an undetected appearance on a desolate site, which was constantly patrolled by the Idaho National Air Guard. About forty days after the appearance of the glyph, a group of four people, headed by a Bill Witherspoon, claimed that they had etched out the pictograph, over a period of 10 days, by pulling a garden cultivator like a plow over the lakebed. Mr. Witherspoon said that he had used ropes to ensure that the lines were straight and the angles perfect. Dr. Deardorff countered by saying that the story was concocted, and that it was sponsored by the government in its effort to quell the public furor. In all fairness to the government authorities though, it might be added here, that the government was probably acting in what it considers is in the best interest of the general public. The authorities did not want to fuel the belief that the glyph had an unexplained origin.\n\nBill Witherspoon was interviewed by newspapers to judge the authenticity of his story. Very quickly it became evident that his explanations lacked credibility. The most unconvincing part of his story was his claim that a garden plow, a rope and a blueprint of the formation were enough equipment to furrow out the glyph effortlessly. Bill Witherspoon\u2019s electronic interview revealed other incongruities. For one, he had stated in the newspapers that he and his team had carried their tools for three quarters of a mile to the formation site everyday for 10 days, however in his video interview he said that he and his team had camped out two miles away from the site.\n\nBill Witherspoon\u2019s team only managed to gouge out a \u00bd inch deep line with great exertion when they were asked to demonstrate how they had gouged out 13.3 miles of lines, 3 inches deep and 10 inches wide. The line lacked neatness, and, the displaced soil fell unevenly on the two sides of the carved line. No one believed anymore that the original glyph could have been created by using crude tools such as garden plows.\n\n\n\n",

            "Here are some realistic ways this design could have been generated by humans:\n\n### 1. **Manual Creation Using Tools**\n- **Survey Equipment:** Using precise surveying equipment like theodolites and GPS devices, a team could have mapped out the intricate design accurately on the ground.\n- **Marking Tools:** Stakes, strings, and marking tools such as chalk or spray paint could have been used to outline the pattern before engraving it.\n- **Excavation Tools:** Shovels, rakes, and possibly small machinery like tillers could have been used to carve the design into the ground.\n\n### 2. **Mechanical Methods**\n- **Plowing with a Tractor:** A tractor fitted with custom-designed plows or rakes could have been driven carefully to create the straight lines and precise angles needed for the Shri Yantra.\n- **Drones:** Drones equipped with cameras could have assisted in guiding the creation process from above, ensuring accuracy in the design.\n\n### 3. **Artistic Collaboration**\n- **Large Art Project:** An organized group of artists and volunteers could have collaborated to create the design as a large-scale art project. They might have practiced and planned extensively to execute it flawlessly.\n- **Blueprints:** Detailed blueprints and plans could have been drawn up beforehand, with each participant assigned specific tasks to ensure the entire design was completed correctly.\n\n### 4. **Nighttime Operation**\n- **Work at Night:** To avoid detection, the creators could have worked at night using portable lighting. This would also explain the element of mystery, as fewer people would have witnessed the creation process.\n\n### 5. **Temporary Markings**\n- **Temporary Materials:** The initial outlines might have been made using temporary materials such as biodegradable paint or chalk, which were later washed away or faded, leaving only the carved lines.\n\n### 6. **Pre-existing Knowledge and Skills**\n- **Knowledge of Sacred Geometry:** The creators would need a solid understanding of the principles of sacred geometry and the specific proportions and alignments of the Shri Yantra.\n- **Local Expertise:** Individuals familiar with the local terrain and soil conditions would have had an advantage in creating such a design efficiently.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the intricate nature of the Shri Yantra and its symbolic significance, it is plausible that a dedicated group of individuals with the necessary tools, skills, and planning could have created the design. The precision and scale of the work suggest that it was a well-coordinated effort rather than a spontaneous or accidental occurrence. \n\nAlso, In 1990, theodolites and GPS technology were available, but their accessibility and common usage were more limited compared to today.\n\n### Theodolites in 1990:\n- **Availability:** Theodolites were widely used in land surveying, construction, and engineering projects. They were precise instruments for measuring angles in horizontal and vertical planes.\n- **Common Usage:** While theodolites were common in professional surveying and engineering contexts, they were not typically accessible to the general public due to their cost and the need for specialized knowledge to operate them.\n\n### GPS Technology in 1990:\n- **Availability:** GPS technology existed and was being used, primarily by the military and some specialized industries. The U.S. Department of Defense had launched the GPS satellite system in the 1970s and 1980s, but its civilian use was still in its early stages.\n- **Common Usage:** Civilian GPS receivers were available but were expensive and not as widely used as they are today. The technology was primarily used by professionals in fields such as surveying, geodesy, and certain scientific applications.\n\nGiven this context, it's less likely that a group of average individuals would have had easy access to theodolites and GPS equipment in 1990. However, professional surveyors, engineers, or artists with access to such technology could have used it to create the Shri Yantra design. Additionally, traditional surveying methods without GPS could still achieve a high degree of precision with skilled operators.\n\nIn summary, while theodolites and GPS technology were available in 1990, their usage was more restricted to professional and specialized applications, making it plausible but not commonplace for such tools to be used in creating a large-scale design in a remote desert area.",
