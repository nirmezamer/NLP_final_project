            "I just posted a 2-minute video of Hans Rosling explaining the data behind population growth using rolls of toiiet paper. I explained that I met him in 2013 when he came to the WHO in Geneva to deliver a talk and that he explained the data behind population growth using rolls of toilet paper. It was an excellent talk.\n\nThe moderators removed it and I am trying to understand why. As the post was taken down, I am asking my question here.\n\nFor reference, the video is at: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnmDc-oR9eA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnmDc-oR9eA)",
            "I have a little data set which I would like to make beautiful, and I would appreciate tips. \n\nThe data pool is about 100 items, each one being a date and numerical value from 0 to 9--if this goes well, I may break down the 0-9 values into finer granularities--I would like to set the date as an independent variable, and look at how the 0-9 value differ from a random baseline.\n\nBecause I fear this isn't going to be clear enough of an explanation for how the 0-9 value can differ from random baseline, my point is: assuming random numbers, any of the numbers from 0 to 9 would be equally likely to come up ; I would like to visualize how much more often (or less frequently) any given number comes up.\n\nAnd the thing about using the dates as an independent variable--I would like to see if the frequency of numbers coming up more often than random evolves over time.",
            "I spent hours trying to get insights from Tableau and PowerBI. The tools were too complex and not designed for marketing needs. Then I found Whatagraph. It was a relief! Whatagraph is built specifically for marketing performance monitoring and reporting. It's easy to use and gives me the insights I need to make informed decisions. I've been using Whatagraph for a while now, and it's saved me so much time and frustration.",
            "What are better ways to display US county-level (or equivalent sub-state government level) data? State data has this problem too but the variance in size between counties is much larger.\n\nI \\*hate\\* the use of US map to depict these data. The colossal counties in the western US overwhelm the small-but-far-more-populous counties east of the Mississippi. The eye is drawn to the wrong places - big areas, not the interesting data. Examples abound here and elsewhere online.\n\nA ranked list avoids the distortion-by-area, but those have the problem that there are thousands of counties, more than one duplicated name, and most aren't recognizably named (as the states and big cities are).\n\nI'm perplexed as to how best to make county-level data beautiful. Ideas?",

It had a lot of words and each one was displayed as a distribution of ratings. I imagine it was motivated by some specific scholarly paper. Anybody got a clue?",
            "Would love some help with a visualization. I'm very interested in how I could present this information in something more compelling than a spreadsheet. My data is something like this:\n\n- There are a certain **total number of appointments** (at a hospital) in a certain period of time. Typically this is referenced as a whole number of appointments, but it's actually also 100% of the total.\n\n- Of those appointments, a certain number are **eligible for electronic check-in**. This represents a subset of the total number of appointments.\n\n- Of those, a certain number will be **successfully checked in electronically**. This represents a subset of the appointments that are eligible for electronic check-in. We often refer to this as a percentage, so \"45% of eligible appointments were checked in electronically\".\n\n- Of those, a certain number will **attempt to self-arrive electronically**. This represents a subset of the appointments that were successfully checked in electronically. We often refer to this as a percentage, so \"In 20% of the cases where the patient checked in electronically, they attempted to self-arrive electronically.\"\n\n- Of those, a certain number will **self-arrive successfully**. This represents a subset of the appointments where self-arrival was attempted. We often refer to this as a percentage, so \"In 40% of the cases where the patient attempted to self-arrive, they were successful.\"\n\nSo, I have this kind of nested set of things, and yet I can't quite figure out a compelling way to visualize this. We typically look at these things in terms of percentages, although it can be valuable to see the true values at times as well.\n\nIt's also important that I be able to visually compare this over time. For example, I'd like to be able to look at this data from June, and compare it to May.\n\nIf it matters, the core data is in Excel right now. I'm not using any fancy tools, if such exist.\n\nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you!",
            "I feel like an idiot asking this but can anyone identify the software used to create a lot of these job search charts?

            "I have personal data on some fanfic writing I do. I'd like to organize the data into charts for hits, kudos, and chapter word length. I use Google a lot like Sheets for charts and data collecting. I was curious if anyone had any other data tools I could try, preferably for free.",
            "This is a very small sample to understand how a random variable changes over time. But, generally speaking, if 0-9 is continuous, you could use a kernel density plot and overlay different years (or have them side by side). If it\u2019s ordinal or discrete, histogram or bar chart I guess.",
            "Is it a popular tool  for companies?",
            "Maybe like an upside down pyramid chart and for each row you could overlay two colours to show difference between may and June",
            "It actually isn't a random variable--I'm sure it will be plenty obvious once done ; in fact, I could show you the raw data, and you'd probably see it--definitely would, if you knew what you were looking for...\n\nOther than that--and thanks for the answer, mind you--I understood very little of that.\n\nIt could be histogram or bar chart... I was thinking of wrapping them around a point, 360\u00b0 style, and maybe making one revolution per month (data spans about 18 months, so it would spin around a good bit.\n\nIt starts off pretty close to random, and ends up in a fairly obvious pattern--this is the sort of change which I am hoping to be able to capture in the evolution of the visualization: the idea behind wrapping it around a point is to contrast the early, more random period, against the later, more skewed period.\n\nThanks again for the response--one last thing, what (ideally free) programs do you recommend for me to have a go at this (I will NOT be learning python for the endeavour ;p )",
            "For tools - I\u2019d personally use R and just ggplot2 or other extensions depending on complexity. If you don\u2019t want to do that, I can\u2019t help!\n\nThe rest of my response is about whether it\u2019s continuous (I.E. you can get 8.51 and 8.78), ordinal (I.E. 1 is bigger than 2 is bigger than 3), or discrete (I.E. 1 is not bigger or smaller than 2, rather it\u2019s a different category).",
            "So I don't think it is continuous... I think it is ordinal, given than it deals with integers from 0-9, and I think it could be discreet, if I choose to include another value which is contained in the data set--it is still the same number of  dates, I would just choose to look at more than a single integer from each entry ; this second value would be a different category, I think.\n\nAnyway, I'm sure I, too, will use R and ggplot2, once I figure out what most of those words mean.\n\nHave an updoot and my thanks!"

Least favored was determined by the greatest decrease from the national usage rate. The one exception to this is Florida, which used all 5 of the drugs/drug categories at rates lower than the national rates, so their most favored drug is the one with the smallest decrease from the national usage rate.

I was single as well so we started our friendship back up. It usually became me, her, my best friend, and the girls roommate hanging out all the time. One New Years the ladies told us they are going to throw a party and to come over! Since we had to go to another party, we said we would stop by for sure. Mainly because I wanted to make a move, and apparently she wanted to as well. New Years comes and I\u2019m beyond wasted with my best friend being the DD. We get to the party and it\u2019s packed, but I\u2019m having a great time due to being drunk as hell. I had to pee pretty bad and saw the roommate first and ask her where the bathroom was. I take the longest pee of my life and practicing what I would say to this girl. When I walk out of the bathroom my best friend grabs my arm and says \u201clet\u2019s get out of here\u201d. Now he knows my plan and was for it and has never steered me wrong before, but I can\u2019t help to feel mad at him as he drags me out of that house. We\u2019re walking and I\u2019m just quiet because I\u2019m mad. He then tells me that he walked into the room of the girl I liked since there were a lot of people and found her smoking meth with some others.

But if you take the mean for 1000 people (assuming random sampling), it's a lot more representative, and the confidence higher (error bars smaller).\n\nOf course, here we want to know if the difference in those sample means or medians are significant.

            "Yeah, true. It is 3 out of 6: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LJ0X748ngm0MNkRBl7IFjiPyyCTKFv6PnUGdYP1R9r8/edit?gid=768687749#gid=768687749](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LJ0X748ngm0MNkRBl7IFjiPyyCTKFv6PnUGdYP1R9r8/edit?gid=768687749#gid=768687749)",

            "If you don't live near water you might not be as likely to be taught how to swim from a young age, so the times you are near water you are more likely to drown.",

            "I meant in the picture. Add timeframe in title and maybe at the bottom \"Source: US State Department - Bureau of Consular Affairs\". Better coloring and then you're golden. Anyways, thought it was interesting. Cheers bro",
            "Agree on the colors though",
            "The ones who got lost on their way to Florida.",
            "That makes sense. In a foreign country it is less likely that someone they know would interfere with the plans, and it is less likely that loved ones would find the body in an unpleasant way. It's sad, but not that hard to believe. \n\nWhat this dada actually shows is that those countries are so safe, that you'd only die unnaturally if you really want to.",

            "That is true, but as it happens, not the case for Mali; it's 3 different drowning incidents",
            "Oh you're right, it's probably the \"natural disaster\" color and being Nepal that makes far more sense.\n\nMaritime looks like Mozambique where it's possible",
            "Thank you for the clarification \ud83d\udc4d",
            "Oh, then it makes sense, thanks!",
            "It's weird to call that a natural disaster",
            "I think that's suicide like most of the surrounding countries, Denmark is just so small and narrow that all of the pixels in it are part of the transition between the black outline and the yellow interior.",
            "Yes, according to the spread sheet that OP linked to, Denmark is maritime accident as well, which makes sense considering all the water. Many tourists don't know how to behave around the ocean, so each year many rescue missions are started e.g. because they float around on water air mattresses without noticing that they are pulled further and further from shore. Sadly, some drown.",

            "Actually, Northern Ireland looks yellower and is smaller, but OP released a spreadsheet and Denmark is indeed maritime accident",
            "Yeah ok I admit I skimmed over it. That said\u00a0your example is only makes sense for countries with very low numbers of American tourists. I stand by the fact that it's a fair assumption to make."
