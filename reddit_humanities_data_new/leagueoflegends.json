        "content": "Greetings Summoners!\n\nWith every new patch Riot introduces to balance out champions and items there are some unforeseen issues that creep up and cause disruption during gameplay. We have noticed that these issues which eventually get fixed clutter up the subreddit immediately following the patch.\n\nWe want to avoid this by having a single Megathread which will be posted after every patch so that you guys can report the various issues in one place. This allows Riot to easily keep track of the bugs by providing a central hub and also allows other users to confirm that they might have encountered.\n\n**Note only bugs caused by the** [14.12](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/patch-14-12-notes/) **Patch should be reported below.**\n\nPrerequisites to be noted before reporting a bug\n\n***\n\n1. A bug will ideally be accompanied with a screenshot or a video. This provides credibility to your report.\n2. Steps to recreate the bugs should be submitted if possible. This helps Rioters recreate the bug and helps them find the cause behind it.\n3. The bug must have been caused by the latest patch.\n\n***\n\n**Format when reporting a bug:** When reporting a bug, please provide as much information as you can about your computer.\n\n\u2022 **Server**: The server you encountered the bug (NA, EUW, EUNE, TR, RU, BR, LAS, LAN etc)\n\n\u2022 **Type of Bug**: Client Bug, In Game Bug etc\n\n\u2022 **Description**: Describe what was the bug that occurred.\n\n\u2022 **Video / Screenshot**: Insert screenshot (F12 in game) or Video of the bug occurring.\n\n\u2022 **Steps to reproduce**: Provide the steps necessary if someone else had to reproduce the bug.\n\n\u2022 **Expected result**: What should have been the result when you follow the steps mentioned above.\n\n\u2022 **Observed result**: What was the result you obtained when you followed the steps mentioned above?\n\n\u2022 **Reproduction rate**:  If you try to recreate the bug how successful are you in causing it to occur?

            "- **Server:** EUW  \n- **Type of Bug:** Game Client/Website   \n- **Description:**   When trying to look at the patch notes either in the in-game tab or on the website, it switches to Czech language instead of my native english. I have checked my IP address location which is also it britain and any other website is fine, additionally the rest of the client is in english.\n- **Video / Screenshot:** https://prnt.sc/O6E4hUMylR0w Google Result for the patch notes webpage showing english text.\nhttps://prnt.sc/VxQxIYt9l4mI official patch notes webpage in czech\nhttps://prnt.sc/86QDrx8vwaLi in game tab in Czech, rest of the client in english   \n- **Steps to reproduce:** Access the website version from the UK or the tab in the client   \n- **Expected result:** The patch notes to be displayed in English   \n- **Observed result:** The patch notes being displayed in Czech   \n- **Reproduction rate:** 100%   \n- **System specs:** Ryzen 5 2500u, 20gb DDR4 RAM, 1TB HDD, Win10",
            "- **Server:**  NA  \n- **Type of Bug:** Game Client   \n- **Description:**  After end of each game, the client begins to slow down. After each game there is a cumulative increase in load times for: end game screen, from end game screen to rest of the client(home/matchmaking/store/etc..., future champ selects start to lagg. The lagg in champ selects after 3-5 games accumulates the lagg that it can take as long as 5-15 seconds when switching your ban picks or champ select picks, also it effects the load times for switching summoners spells and opening up rune page to edit them. Given how one has only 30 seconds to pick a ban, if you mistakenly wait too long it will be impossible to ban a champ. Also, this lagg effects the input for 'lock in' champ which can boot you out of the lobby because due to late champ selection the game cannot receive the input for 'lock in.' Another note: while observing in champ select lobby, and you're lagging, when switching between champ picks/bans very fast ( 0.25 - 0.5 seconds or faster, normal type for switching) the game client will provide an error message of some sorts that says along the lines of \"could't load or couldn't connect or couldn't complete action.\" I observed the best temporary solution is to close client and re-logg between games. This is an ongoing problem since 14.11 and is still an issue on 14.12. The problem is exactly the same as it was in 14.11.  \n- **Video / Screenshot:**   \n- **Steps to reproduce:**  Play 1 matchmaking, observe. Don't log off, play 2nd matchamking game, observe. Don't log off. Repeat until the lagg is impossible to deal with.  \n- **Expected result:**    No lagg in the above mentioned scenarios/menus\n- **Observed result: Compounded lagg**   \n- **Reproduction rate:** 100% but it takes a lot of time to reproduce (assuming 5+ games and not re-logging between them.)   \n- **System specs:** WIN 10.0.19045 Build 19045 Pro N,  B760 AORUS Elite AX, i7-13700k, UHD Graphics 770, NVIDIA Geforece GTX 1080.",

It's the exact same thing. **Vanguard Event: You need to have vanguard running to play.** I've gone through Riot Support, but not only have they offered me no solution, but the solutions that they have been offering me are just a timeline of solutions they've offered other players. \n\n  \nScreenshot: [https://prnt.sc/VxEx\\_\\_OUdRoR](https://prnt.sc/VxEx__OUdRoR)\n\nSteps to re - produce: Unknown.  This happens randomly. A few things that have been known to cause this issue for me is to leave my client open for an extended period of time, or to disconnect while waiting to join a game,\n\n\n\nExpected result: Load into game without any issues.\n\nObserved result: Am given that error code as soon as I load into the game, causing me to have to restart my computer.

Also the game frequently freezes at the champion select screen. Specifically, in ARAM champion select lobbies, we are unable to swap champions, select runes, or edit summoner spells.\n\n\u2022\u00a0**Steps to reproduce**: launch the client and queue up for an Aram game in Sydney Australia using the Optus internet\n\n\u2022\u00a0**Expected result**: being able to launch the LoL client and play the game with no issues \n\n\u2022\u00a0**Observed result**: stuck at the ready-check screen, after I restart my computer I was able to get into the champ select lobby however, there was a prompt says\"lost connection to server\" which resulted me being unable to swap/pick champions on bench and edit runes/summoner spells \n\n\u2022\u00a0**Reproduction rate**: 10/10 happens to every ARAM game\n\n\u2022\u00a0**System specs**: Ryzen 7 2700X eight-core processor, 16gb, Nividia Gforece RTX 2060, Win10",

            "* **Server:**\u00a0EUW\n* **Type of Bug:**\u00a0Game Client/Game\n* **Description:**\u00a0After champ select, the game takes a bit longer to show the loading screen than usual since last week (time of writing this, 17/6/2024), by the time it shows the loading screen everyone is like at 90% of loading into the game. The problem lays when many times it doesn't even open the game even tho i have the  app \"open\" in the task bar. If i hover my mouse over the game it will not show any screen just as if its bugged with the title of the app with no image. It forces me to open task manager and force end the game, and to do that i basically need to force end every single league related apps, including the client, and for some reason i have like more than 4 same apps of league open in the task manager ( idk if that is normal but i never notice it before) [https://prnt.sc/oXQeS3AzFR46](https://prnt.sc/oXQeS3AzFR46) ; [https://prnt.sc/5sKrKVwtiem1](https://prnt.sc/5sKrKVwtiem1) ( idk if has any relation to it). \n* The game loads in for everyone else but not for me, i am marked as AFK and many times they remake and i get penalized for it. I had a ban of 24 hours from playing the game because of it just three days ago. \n* **Video / Screenshot:**  Not had the ability to record it nor take a print screen yet but will update this post eventually if anyone will need actual preview of what is happening. It happens randomly unfortunately and i can't control it.\n* **Steps to reproduce:**\u00a0Game randomly does it going in to loading screen.\n* **Expected result:**\u00a0Game doesn't load up or show image (screen is non existent many times and sometimes the screen is just black with a loading window mouse icon showing)\n* **Observed result:**\u00a0I had downloaded porofessor two weeks ago to use it but eventually swapped for blitz app, after having blitz installed thats when everything started to bug out. But when i had blitz installed everything was worse, i had a black screen the whole time of the loading screen and i would hear the game enter and all of the sounds of the game but there was no image. Force ending the game and reconnecting would not work. Eventually i deleted the app and the issue that i originally mentioned above started to happen. \n* **Reproduction rate:** Random times, but i would say 3/10 games it happens.\n* **System specs:**\u00a0Ryzen 7 3700X ; DDR4 16GB ; RTX3600 Ti",

But no. People had to slowly start calling every single god damn mistake an \"int\". Miss 3 creeps? Inted phase lane. Botched a tower dive? Inted the game. Failed to secure an objective? Inted etc. People are allowed to be bad at the game and have 1/17/2 games, they'll eventually fall into the bracket they belong, especially new players.\n\n\nPros also have a huge impact by saying they inted the draft, the invade, the flip, the everything. **Making mistakes doesn't mean you int for fuck's sake** , just admit the blunder and move on.  \nNot to mention the community inveting idiotic new terms that mean absolutely nothing, what the fuck is *soft inting* even supposed to look like. If I ask 10 people what it is, I'll get 10 different answers.\n\nSo, of course, after years of all of the above, and more, people will report everything for inting, and we have situations like these.

        "content": "\"Your rank denotes your true skill level.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat used to hold true, but now I don't feel like it does.\n\nIt used to be that way, so there was motivation to climb. \n\nFor the past five years I've been streaming, I've always aimed for challenger.\n\nThat's because you can only get to challenger if you deserve it.\n\nBut now I say it's the same in challenger as it's in master or grandmaster. \n\nWhy? Because I did hit challenger, and found that it wasn't what I imagined it would be like.\n\nEven in challenger bad players are still bad, good players are still good, just like in master and grandmaster.\n\nSoloq rank is no longer an effective quantifier for a person's skill level. \n\nAnd that's an unsolvable problem. \n\n\"new account-low rank duo\" has already seen to that, by mixing up all the players. \n\nExcept for the very top where the pros are, the rank doesn't matter. \n\nI don't know what started it, but some of the factors were:\n\n\"new account mmr boosting- low rank duo\" and \"gambling sites betting on soloq games\" and \"wintrading\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the single biggest factor is where the game has been nudged toward in the recent years. \n\nYou pick overpowered champs, and basically run it down until you can kill everyone.\n\nThat's how the game state has been for far too long, and now people don't know any macro. \n\nThey don't know how to teamfight. \n\nFor example, carries need to know when they should prioritize the front line, or when they should dive the squishies.\n\nBut nowadays you just whale on the thing in front of you, and they melt because there's no real tank in today's game.\n\nYou pick an overpowered champ, target the carries and then it's over. \n\nAnd so your mechanics improve but your knowledge of the game deteriorates.\n\nNow when you fall behind, you don't know how to bide your time and recover. \n\nInstead you do the same thing you always do, you target the carries, but then get killed and say \"oh well\"\n\nYou're basically a Pachycephalosaurus.\n\nThat's what it's been like for the past 2, 3 years. You forget the macro.\n\nThe only ones that have retained the macro knowhow are the pros. \n\nThe soloq players who try to play through macro get tired of all these Pachycephalosaurus ramming their heads. \n\nJax jumps in, spins the thing, and you're like \"wtf is he doing\"\n\nThen he gets a triple kill and then a quadra. You're like \"is that how the game should be played?\"\n\nBut if the same player goes up against a better player, he goes 0/7.\n\nEvery game you ram your skull into the other Pachycephalosaurus.\n\nIf his skull breaks, you win. If yours breaks, he wins. \n\nThat decides the entire game for all the other players, and the ones trying to play normally get frustrated because the game's out of their hands. \n\nThis in turn mixes up all the players of varying skill levels.\n\nSo good players can end up in lower ranks while bad players can end up in higher ranks, depending on luck.\n\nWhen I hit challenger and high GM, it didn't really feel like they were much better.\n\nThere were so many OTPs. If top lost, it was the jungler's fault. People didn't take champion matchups into consideration.\n\nAnd the bizarre thing is, in other games if you get banned on one account, all your other accounts in that game get banned or suspended\n\nBut that's not the case in league. Why is that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmbition is a retired pro, S7 Worlds winner and of 2013 All-Stars fame. He now streams full time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3hsaXP-Eg",

You're like \"is that how the game should played?\"\n\n>But if the same player goes up against a better player, he goes 0/7.\n\nAs a returning player who quit back in S4, this is so true. I'm still struggling to get comfortable with the game when it comes to mechanics and overall feel of the champions. Many of the ones I used to play changed, etc...\n\nBut the amount of times in SoloQ I see some Sett, Sylas, Jax, w/e, go in 1v3 and think to myself that the guy is griefing but he ends up with a triple is staggering. So much so that I feel my biggest struggle currently is to know when to or not to fight. Sometimes I would not help because in my mind, no way we win that 2v4. But in fact we did...\n\nBut then the next game I say fuck it and I do go for the 2v4, then we get destroyed. It's quite frustrating.\n\nThat being said, as a mechanical player, I do prefer the current state of the game compared to how it was. The only issue with it is that it makes it much harder for a new player to get good. You can learn macro relatively quickly, especially with how much amazing resources is available nowadays. Knowing when you can 1v2/3/4 takes MUCH longer, assuming you even get there.\n\nI somewhat dread the assassins changes though, as champions like LB are already stupidly strong, it will make midlane a coinflip every game.",
            "After reading this I have more questions than answers. What the hell is \"Pachycephalosaurus\" :D.",
            "But the single biggest factor is where the game has been nudged toward in the recent years.\n\n**You pick overpowered champs, and basically run it down until you can kill everyone.**\n\n**That's how the game state has been for far too long, and now people don't know any macro.**\n\nthis is by far the biggest reason why SoloQ feels so bad to play nowadays. And i absolutely agree that SoloQ for sure doesn't feel good anymore to play. D1 up to Master 400LP there is barely any difference, at 600LP it's gm already. I have never been GM but managed to reach as far as 450LP master, but i can tell you in the past i could feel a massive difference between 100LP master and 300LP master. Hell even between d1 and d3, you could clearly feel a big difference in the game. But Now? hardly.\n\nSometimes you have better players, and sometimes worse. Every 3-game you feel like you play with absolute Boosted Players ingame and you literally refuse to believe that they got into x Elo on their own just because by how bad they Play that Game but then you check their op:gg and it's a legit account and you are literally life questioning how this is even possible when they play that bad.\n\nAnyways:\n\nA very big problem is that nowadays you can just win lane, get some plates, a few solo Kills early-game and now you can oompa loompa urself entire mid/lategame with coinflip rng engages aram mid fights, and playing sidelane is unneeded. I see so many adc players barely hitting 200Cs in 30Minutes nowadays while back in the Day everybody got flamed as an Ebay Player that didn't had at least 200CS and it was super rare to see also. I still have the same opinion that i had after season 9. \"When riot decided to increase gold generation with the invention of Tower Plates, they also fcked up the entire strategy part of the Game\". The biggest problem is that plates are a massive Gold Boost, so massive, they accelerate you so hard, that playing Side-lanes properly after the laning-phase is just not needet anymore, they push you easely into 1-shot range when you win Lane, and then all you have to do, is to perma flip and hope it works in your favor. While back in the day, it was too risky, to go aram mid, because 1 wrong engage, could literally mean, \"you will not be able to kill the enemy anymore for the next 5+minutes because now you got pushed out of 1-shot range and ur main gold generation was from minions, so now you lost a certain amount of minions and it was just super hard to get back into 1-shot range, because you can't just randomly get a 600Gold bounty, or a 700Gold tower, that would be able to push you back into 1-shot range.\n\nSo the guy playing sidelane macro would have completely taking over the Game. Playing side-lanes in old league generally had the effect that the entire game, gets slowed down as a whole, and is more about strategy, while nowadays it just feels like, it's 80-90% about mechanics and perma fighting trying to kill the enemies before they kill you. it's so sad how this game has changed. But it's w.e i said this a million times, that i hate the plate system, that it ruins mid-game build up, and that it is just unhealthy as a whole for SoloQ and the Game in general, and should have been removed or nerft massively a long time ago, but every time i say smth about this, people on reddit usually downvote me and tell me \"this is not true, you have no clue about the game yada yada yada\" even tho i'm high elo since 8+ Years (diamond since s7) - (master since s9) and play this game since season 4. What can i even do at this point? riot isn't listening, community never listens, and whatever i say is apparently always wrong.",

            "i think the balancing recently has been really shit. because playing meta at a high level is far too important. like this start of season was beyond disgusting with just corki, trist, brand and whatever else was flavor of month. like u go to top of ladder on opgg and EVERYONE is playing these champs. what the fuck? i wish game was less meta dependant somehow.",

The biggest fail was that fake ass \"durabity patch\" that only scratched the surface of having too much damage in the game and immediately after they started buffing the game again to the same levels or even higher than before.

Either it worked and they went 17/4 or they failed to get a lead early and went 3/14. \n\n\nIts better now but the problem is a lot of these players are only good at this playstyle and perma stuck in dia, emerald or low master whatever. And they completely refuse to learn any other aspect of the game but the Problem is they warp the game entirely around them because its usually junglers. You HAVE to play around them most of the time if you want to win. They drag you down into their monkey play style. \n\n\nI lost so many games where i had score of like 2/1, 30 cs lead top lane but still lost at 20 mins because the team score was like 12/30 at 20 mins. And i Wonder should i have Just given up on playing correctly and just say \"fuck it i am not catching my waves top, i am going with my team currently fighting with a 4k gold deficit over a ward in sidelane brush?\n\nThose games are only fun for the monkeys playing their dumb perma fighting champs. \n\n\nSeriously i have a friend who has been playing league for years only playing Like this. He is not getting any better at the game. If briar, poppy is strong on current patch and he gets lucky with his games he can go up to plat in soloq and sometimes carry a game in emerald.

            "jokes on Ambition, but most league players have always played the game with a selfish main character  mindset for more than three years.

This isn't even just Challenger, GM, Masters or w/e, as this is prevalent in all ranks now. Back in the days, gold and below players had little to no ego as they strive  to work together and achieve victory far more often then platinum and diamond players, and that's because  plats and diamonds tend to develop an ego which their skill cannot handle. Now even silvers have an ego consistently trying to parrot pro players and believing no one else is above how they should play, which leads to less coordination. Every year League feels worse than before, and just when you think the game can't devolve into  more degeneracy, the game and its community manage to surprise you even further.

We have gotten to the point where the most effective strategy is to lock in a Z tier champ, build the current most busted items, and just faceroll your keyboard.\n\nBack in the day this wouldn't get you very far. At some point you had to get good. But the gap in power between the best champs and the rest of the roster is such a fking joke. \n\nIt's like HoB corki last patch. Man, that was such complete nonsense. Level 2 he valks into your face and deletes 80% of your HP in a single second.

The player complaining about this is literally a worlds winning jungler, this doesn't apply to more than 10 people in the world.\n\nThese players he faced simply do something better than the players in master or GM. they aren't Faker (or maybe they are xD) and will make macro mistakes. maybe this guy in challenger knows when to go sidelane but otherways plays identically to the GM player, or maybe they know better when they can 1v2, or just space better in-lane",

            "Played in both NA and KR before and after 2018. I think 'modern league' started in 2018 with the ward changes, which led to a LCK slump after their dominance prior. This led to younger Korean solo q players playing more like the players in Chinese servers where micro and outplaying is far more valued than macro. Ironically, this adaptation of solo q culture, for better or worse, led to LCK being on top again in recent years in pro-play. \n\nThe pace of this game is only going to get faster and about who can react in a fight better with micro because now they are taking account of Chinese data for balance.\n\nAs for NA, it feels like they have been stuck in the past. People NEVER ff, play non-meta champs like nasus, and they never stray from their macro plans like 1-3-1, even if variance calls to group up.

I did all the things they tell you to climb, I mained 1 or 2 champions, avoided tilt, blah blah. And I did it! I reached plat by playing Asol, Syndra and sometimes Ahri if I needed to mix it up. I actually performed extremely well on Syndra, I think I had like a 60% WR at one point with her, eventually reaching Emerald. \n\nBut here's the thing. As soon as I landed in Emerald, it was like a whole different world. The micro that everyone had was \\*DRAMATICALLY\\* better than me. Like it wasn't even close. But the macro didn't change at all. Only the flaming got worse and worse. It was such a stark difference that it actually turned me off from the game again pretty quickly.

Certain classes are pure PVP classes, they don't really contribute for sieging, neutral objectives, etc, and I think it negatively impacts the game by turning it into team deathmatch.  Its one thing to have one or two champs who are pure PVP, but if you get 5-6 assassin lockins the way we did with the fighter/skirmisher thing a couple years ago the game just isn't going to be fun to play.",

Can you fight a Darius at level 1 as Irelia? What about as Sett? Trundle? Can Asol take a teamfight at level 5 around drake? \n\nKnowing when and when not to fight is really a question of champion breakpoints (yours and your opponents), and the map state. Jax should never be able to 1v3.. because if he's strong enough to 1v3 everyone on the map should know it, and avoid that position. Or at least, they need to try REAL hard to avoid it.

Situations like those are quite easy to learn from. Sometimes though, it feels so random. It really depends on the champions you face I imagine.\n\nI love playing against mages, because unless you massively fuck up, the lane is quite safe. Assassins on the other hand, you never know if you face a guy with 3 games on the champion that will mostly play passive or just poorly, or a person with thousands of hours on that champion with electrocute/ignite and that will all-in you lvl 3, but are stuck at low elo because they have no brain past the laning phase.\n\nLike, I've played a lot of Yone recently (I know...), and I can safely say, I'm still confused about the Akali matchup. I know it's Akali favoured, but more than anything, I feel I have almost no agency. If they bring fleet/tp, it's pretty free. If they bring elec/ignite, it's terrible.

I was watching midbeast the last few days, and there many times where he went and won a 1v2/3 and my first thought was: \"I would never go for that play\", not even from a lack of mechanical confidence, but because I would think I would just die, when in fact I would be fine.\n\nSo I guess, I kind of agree with you in the end, lol?

But other things have become a hyper fixation. Like wave-states, small skirmishes, and split pushing. \n\nAnecdote from a recent game. I was up 3 kills, and 20cs on my opponent. We had a dragon and took about 3-4 plates on bot lane. My top laner was 0/3. He was complaining that \"every lane was losing\" and pointed out that the enemy ADC had 1 more level than me (because his support was roaming and he was getting solo exp). Basically they were just so fed up with the game because they were losing individually, that they completely shut off any understanding of the game-state or what's going on.\n\nMost people are just not willing to drop the ego, and everyone has to be a carry these days.\n\nIt doesn't help that they are continually isolating the playerbase and we have to communicate exclusively through pings and emotes (if we're lucky, and they're not deafened to that as well). So then you just have to discent what other players want through body language and then you suddenly get baited into a fight because they feign an engage and don't fully commit and so on. Everyone's ego is way too big and I say that as an ADC main. Which should show how fucking bad it's become.
