            "27 year old, graduated from top tier college in India, worked at a PSU for 3 years, followed by a tech startup for the last 2 years. Planning to go for masters in ME at UCSD. Following questions make me uncomfortable, and need some perspective on them.  \n1)  **flexibility:**  IMO India gives a lot of short term flexibility, like since I dont have any loan I can switch careers from tech to MBA/do whatsoever I want without much worries. Being from one of good colleges, I believe I can get a descent package any day I wish to switch to other roles. Compared to this, I'll have to pay a hefty fees in USA and work my ass to pay back the loan for another 2 years, followed by a constant fear of being sent back to India\n\n2)**Comfort:** Got a househelp taking care of all the chores so that I can have all my time to myself, which will be impossible in USA. Also the cost of things will feel exorbitant for first 2 years.\n\n3)**Growth :** Exposure to smart people and learning new tech is the only reason I want to go to US;. I have a very comfy life here otherwise. Worked at a startup for last 2 years, where projects were interesting but resources (colleagues to have discussion and execute project) were not that great.\n\n4)**Another year :** I didnot accept admits to other better colleges like UMich because it was expensive.  In hindsight, some people suggest to wait for another year to reapply and join better college instead of UCSD. (UCSD was the my safe choice, and I am sure I can get into better college, but then I dont know if waiting for another year will be worth it)",

Initially, I considered BCA, but after comparing BCA and B.Tech, I found B.Tech to be a better option. However, I don't think I have enough skills to directly pursue B.Tech. So, I'm considering doing a Diploma in CS and then pursuing B.Tech, followed by a Master's degree if possible. I'm not confirmed about anything yet and still feeling confused.

After coming to college, I was still in the same mindset of my jee prep days. I didn't make any female friends in college in my 1st semester. I was just doing the same hustle. Later on I realised I had to enjoy my college life as well. I wanted to get into the main group of my class but which had the popular girls and boys but it was too late. I am currently in a position where I talk to all of them but I am not able to get too close with any girl. I tried hard but was of no use and I was even having the doubt that maybe I may look too desperate as well. I still regret the decision why I didn't do the same thing in my first semester when everything was fresh. I am finding it too hard to make any close female friends in college.

            "Hey indian ladies and men living in the USA, I'm in a bit of a dilemma here and wanted to seek some advise. My parents live by themselves in India and want to visit us this summer. They say that when parents visit kids in the USA they are there for about 4-6months. My husband is very clear that anything more than 10-12 days will make him very uneasy. In the past when they've visited for longer it's really been a very stressful time for me. When i communicate this with my parents they tell me that I have to convince him. That they spend a lot of money to travel to USA so it can't be such a short trip etc. They are also older and traveling is not so easy. I love my parents and I care for them but I also want their trip to be an enjoyable one and not one where my husband chooses to sulk. Also summer is the only time, we get some time to ourselves as a family for our own travel and such and my husband wants to make the best of that for our family time. I do not want to make my parents feel that they are not wanted by me but at the same time I want to tell them to respect our wishes as well. How do I tell them this? Or am I being unreasonable? If i'm being unreasonable what can I do to convince my husband?",

I know with the e-visa the date of expiry is the date in which you have to enter the country but I've read that's not the case with the paper visa so I'm really confused.\n\nAny help appreciated!",

I am a freelance content writer. I am making roughly 1.5L/month. The bank says only TDS-related transactions will count toward the computation for the home loan. The 10% of my income that does have TDS deductions from clients comes from one-off work within India mainly for design projects, which is not significant and just based on that the bank cannot give any loan, which is reasonable. \n\nNow, as I am working as a freelancer for US clients directly, the payments are received in my bank account through PayPal, so there's no TDS that they can deduct for these payments. Most likely, there's no way for me to even coerce these payments and make them eligible for TDS (afaik; so do correct me if I'm wrong). These are simple orders received over email, and payments made twice a month or so, very cash-type business. And all this income is being filed as exactly that, \"cash\" income, by the bank, which is not relevant for my home loan computation.\n\nMy CA who's been helping me with legal things, ITR filing, etc. has no solution for me. My bank representative also has no solution for me.

That will take me 116 months or 9.5 years to save up enough to buy in cash, but by that time the 35L would be much higher thanks to inflation.\n\nAny way out for a freelancer like me?

It would be abysmal if a quarter century goes by and material things don't manage to improve.\n\n> While travelling to other countries it becomes apparent that we have a long way to go before we truly say that we are on the same level as other countries.\n\nSo now this depends on what countries you are trying to compare to. 3 decades isn't enough time and comparing to western countries and especially East Asia is simply unrealistic. India should be aiming to match development similar to SEA (Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand) or Brazil/Mexico.\n\n> Do you think there will be a massive scale of improvement in our country in the coming decades, or is it just going to be the same shit, different government type of scenario?\n\nInstances of massive scale of improvement in a \"short\" period of time has always been an outlier throughout history... either due to small countries being given a bunch of outside aid (S. Korea and Japan) or consistently strong leadership to steer the country in the proper direction over several decades (Singapore and China).

            "Hi everyone. \nI am a 29 year old male and a father to a toddler. I don't know what I should say but i haven't been able to sleep properly since ages. Six months ago I had an accident and had to leave my job. My right leg doesn't work anymore. I need help waking up and lying down. There is no source of income. I am down to neck in debt. I don't even have enough money to buy diapers or food for that matter. I am looking for job everyday, but whatever this fucked up recession is doing to us is effecting everyone's life I guess.\n\nI have experience as an HR. I can work in any thing related to customer relations or human relations.\n\nI know there are probably thousands of people facing the same problem but I can't face it anymore. I am nothing but a burden to my family now, a failure. I have promised God that if by the end of tomorrow I am unable to earn anything then I will end my life.",
            "I am writing this post not knowing who else to discuss this with or find anyone who can relate to this experience. I was raised for the most part in what I thought was a traditional household with modern values. Only much later did I realize that was not entirely the case.\n\nTo elaborate, both my parents are well-educated and working professionals. I was bullied numerous times as a kid and have grown up with likely undetected mental health issues. Major life changes brought me and my family into a close community of upper castes and Brahmins.\n\nI was raised with an aspiration to assimilate into the culture and traditional lifestyle of Brahmins. This was partly because my parents wanted to be part of that community, instilling the belief that following the lifestyle of a different group might make us better. Additionally, I had seen people of my caste behave poorly towards women and undervalue education, whereas we observed many upper castes and especially Brahmins who were well-educated and well-settled in life. Moreover, my parents had close friends, closer than family, who belonged to the Brahmin community and were practicing traditional rituals to varying degrees.\n\nI almost believed I was half Brahmin until I benefited from reservations. During this teenage phase of upbringing, I hardly socialized compared to my peers and friends. Most of what I was exposed to were religious and spiritual speeches by various preachers and babas. The central theme was the normalization of dogma, miracles, and an emphasis on belief rather than rationality. Additionally, given my introverted nature and the cultish upbringing involving no interaction with people my age, I did not make many friends. I do not blame my circumstances entirely, but I cannot ignore their contribution as a key factor.\n\nFast forward two decades later, and after numerous depressive episodes in life, I educated myself on different ideologies and perspectives. I learned from acquaintances and distant friends how their lives were so different and the kind of exposure they had. Over time, I realized my folks' propensity to be hypnotically drawn towards cults and single-minded perspectives with no room for nuance, introspection, or questioning. I also realized that celebrations and happiness are not to be shunned as vulgar and greedy disillusionments. In short, I grew a bit more liberal in how to view life and people.\n\nCurrently, I find myself in a happy relationship, although not fully accepted by my parents. On the other hand, my parents have grown increasingly regressive and accustomed to being part of many cults. Behind the scenes, they express hatred towards me and my choices at every moment, while with me, they express great anxiety for their lives and me being their only caretaker. My relationship with my partner and our work lives are affected daily by the casual lack of empathy or care they express, and I have not been able to make many friends, especially someone who I can talk to about these things. Whether it's near and distant family members or friends, most have grown apart or do not share distantly liberal beliefs.\n\nThis brings me to the present day - I continue to be lonely and depressed but do not wish to share this with anyone. Having tried therapy a couple of times, I am getting weary of explaining my life story with little chance of the therapist truly understanding where I come from. Has anyone gone through a similar transformation in their lifetime or can relate to these emotions and is willing to talk? Does anyone have suggestions on how to progress in life when one foot is tied to guilt-tripping loved ones and the other to a lack of social life? Does anyone have experience on how to overcome regret? I look forward to your perspectives!\n\nTL;DR: Raised in a traditional household that aspired to assimilate Brahmin culture and lifestyle, leading to an isolating and dogmatic upbringing. Over time, grew disillusioned with parents' regressive views and lack of open-mindedness. Now in a happy relationship but not accepted by increasingly cult-involved parents.

            "My Indian Parents don\u2019t let me decide for my life. \n\n\n\nI\u2019m an NRI, and live in a west country. This year I\u2019m going to graduate from Year 12. But since last 2 years my parents are talking with their Indian friends and have decided that I should go to India and prepare for JEE for 1.5 years in hope that I\u2019ll go to IIT. \n\n\n\nMind you there are three universities from my cities which come in top 30 QS rank for engineering and I\u2019m happy to go in one of them to purse the discipline with my friends doing similar major. But my parents somehow got this idea that all these rankings are paid and these colleges are nothing in front of IIT. I eavesdropped on my dad talking about how none in his distant family has ever been able to crack it, so he wants me to be the first one.  But his 2 arguments are most CEOs are IIT graduates in the world, and if ever in my life I want to work in India I will have a chance in my hand. I told him I have never thought of doing a job in India when I we have the best laws here for work life balance. But he just tries being aggressive so I just remain silent when my life decisions are being made without asking me. \n\n\n\nHe says once you\u2019ll graduate from IIT then your life will be cakewalk, companies will run behind you to hire you. Everyone will kiss your feet, and you will earn in millions. But honestly I\u2019m happy with my simple life. I\u2019m already burnt out with the rigorous schedule in my school. Jee will be 3 months after my final exams. My curriculum is a lot different than what they ask questions upon. When I told my dad this he just asked me to prepare for it for next 1.5 years. Now for a 4 year degree I have to spend 5.5 years at-least. I have no power for that. \n\n\n\nHere I\u2019m studying for my exams and side by side researching JEE which has taken a big toll on my life. At the age of 17 I am diagnosed with Rheumatoid arthritis my life expectancy can go as low as 10 less years than normal life. I\u2019m still studying pushing myself, with a risk of heart attack. \n\n\n\n\n\nBTW, all these uncles who are asking my dad to send me to IIT have their kids settled in USA, Canada and Australia with a successful life and no they never asked their own kids to join IITs. It is my dad who is so keen to send me to a college where chances of getting in virtually 0. Furthermore he taunts me that I want an easier life and don\u2019t want to do \u201csangharsh\u201d. Moreover, all these uncles who live in India tried their best to force their kids in IIT and they all failed and got depressed and were not able to do anything in life. I wonder how every friend on my dad\u2019s had a son preparing for engineering. \n\n\n\nAnyways, Can someone give me tips on how long I have to study for this exam. And what strategies I should consider for this exam. I guess I have no option but to give it a try.",

One day, her father had to be admitted to the hospital; it was a life-and-death situation. I was with her during that time, spending day and night at the hospital for four months. During this period, we grew closer and eventually became inseparable. I tried to end the relationship three times, but she begged me to stay, cried, and became emotional, so I stayed. She was becoming obsessive over me, getting angry over small things, and arguing for days. She questioned my every action\u2014why do you do this, why do you talk to that person, why do you go there\u2014she asked me to block people, and I did everything she asked. I never told her she was being obsessed.\n\nBut then, after her father recovered and was brought home, she started creating distance between us. By then, I was deeply in love with her. I cried and begged her not to leave me, but she didn't listen. She said I had become obsessed with her, and she couldn\u2019t tolerate it anymore. She said she couldn\u2019t make everyone unhappy just for my happiness. I wondered why she didn\u2019t realize this earlier when I tried to end things, why she stopped me then. Why didn\u2019t she realize this when we became intimate so many times?\n\nNow, I am broken. I am depressed. I have attempted suicide twice.

You can't predict struggles man, if you could do that you wouldn't have to struggle in the first place. And substituting JEE Prep for the real struggles of life is the biggest fucking fallacy embedded into the Indian psyche.\n\nJEE Prep doesn't prepare you to face the struggles of life and make something out of it. Hell-fucking-no . The vast majority of my peers, including me were largely clueless in college. There was no ounce of a purpose to be found in anyone. But there were expectations, expectations for us to become something by the time we graduate. With nothing else to do, we have to look for well-worn paths to success. The IIT-IIM pipeline, the IIT-UPSC Pipeline, the IIT-Software-Engineeering pipeline are some prominently chosen options. But with that sorted you still have problems. You kinda don't care about the classes: your degree and career goals are completely out of line/ the prof sucks/ the class seems obtuse and unnecesaary. But you are made to care about your grades because that hurts your placement. So there's a general sense of apathy that underscores the IIT experience. Note that I am generalizing here, most people grow out of this eventually and figure themselves, but that's normally only much later after graduation. Many people do good work, but that almost always comes after one has grown out of the morass of living to prove oneself.\n\nIf possible, try talking to your dad about how your specific choice of engineering is much better served outside india due to the limited facilities in here. Research fields in universities outside india covers a much wider breadth than they do here. The scope and funding for research is much better outside, and most important innovations are not done here (although IIT grads that have left the country are often involved, but you get the point). It is much better for you if you can build a better profile in the better research environment you have around you. A good plan to build your career outside india might be what convinces him. But I am not sure, I can't truly help you.\n\nIf you nevertheless have to take up JEE, I wouldn't say that it is impossible. Different people have different ways of doing it. What I would say is most important is to be crystal clear in your understanding of the material being taught. This is a game that proceeds as follows:\n\n1. Read the book until you can make sense of what is written.\n2. Look at problems to see of you can solve them\n3. Find a problem at which you fail\n4. Try using every tool you have to attack the problem. Try every approach you can think of.\n5. For every approach, see if you can grasp why it worked/ or why it didn't\n6. Rinse and repeat.\n\nJee prep is the above game repeated unto exhaustion. It is quite the rewarding endeavour if properly done, although it was very very difficult. It is quite effective at teaching you how to build your own tools to solve difficult problems, I think. I think JEE prep is well worth the effort just for that experience. It would be quite the productive exercise if everyone wasn't made to feel like their lives depended on it.",

If all goes well and your parents are progressive, may even suggest family counselling but that might be too far bc log kya kahenge.\u00a0\n\u00a0Cons: Many Indian parents will just use this conversation to guilt you instead of learning from it.\u00a0\n\n\n2. Seek therapy - might go a long way towards you reconciling with yourself. Cons: might be expensive, stigma attached to it, you need a decent therapist for this to work.\u00a0\n\n\n3. Leave home as soon as possible so you don't have to be around them all the time when they fight - Cons: expensive, if you love your parents it will be painful.\u00a0",

Any stuff you two can do together or set apart some time to spend just the two of you so you can feel more connected? Same with the kids - do you all spend some time doing family activities or just hanging out together?

            "So you get close to someone when you share something about yourself that you actually care about or are able to be vulnerable with them. Or if you even just like them as a person you can take an initiative and just ask them to hang out and have a cup of coffee. This way you're being vulnerable and showing yourself and at the same time creating an opportunity for **both of you** to get to know each other. You can't control if you two would become close but you should still try. And you can still be close with someone without being in the same group as them. I would say don't **try** to be close to someone, get to know them and if you both vibe you'll get close. Taking action is the important thing here which is all you should care about.\n\nAlso it's not a waste of your college life if you're not able to do a certain thing. College life is an opportunity of being able to try different things and throw yourself in different situations, have new experiences, learn more about yourself and the world. Don't measure it by success in only one area. When trying to be more social and increase your interaction with the opposite gender, don't forget about the other aspects of college life, the other opportunities it provides you, whether it be having the time to try out different hobbies, being part of different clubs/societies, studying, knowing more about your field, knowing more about different fields other than your own, etc. You don't have to do all of this at the same time too!\n\nI would also say the things you do outside of college, whether it be talking to someone from a different college, being part of a different social group outside college, going on trips even if you go just by yourself, trying out a hobby for which there isn't a club for in college, are all part of your college life too as you would be able to do these things only during this time.\n\nYou had asked about a very specific thing but I think it's important to have a wider perspective for how you define a good college life. As a bonus of having a wider perspective you may also seem a bit less desparate and maybe have more success in the social area, but remember that's not the point.\n\nOne more thing, it's not bad to feel desparate but it's important to conduct yourself appropriately. Being desparate is a sign that you care about yourself and want to do things also, not like your friends who are maybe too satisfied in their comfort zone.",
            "How old are you?\n\nForgetfulness is pretty common now, especially with the information overload. So if these are isolated incidents, I don't think you need to worry. Especially if you realise or remember that you have forgotten something. With problematic forgetfulness, you wouldn't even be able to realise that you have forgotten. So if these are just sometimes or with certain things (like numbers or names), forgive yourself.\n\nBut, it can also be a medical issue. Certain mental health issues, like depression & anxiety, can cause memory-loss/difficulty to remember. If the memory issues increase, definitely go see a doctor. As an aside, does anyone else in your house/nearby have similar issues? Is there good ventilation in your house? There was a famous reddit thread where someone reported memory issues and paranoia, turned out to be that his house had dangerous levels of Carbon Monoxide. CO can be toxic, and fatal with time or quantity.",
            "Therapists can't and should not prescribe medications. Psychiatrists do that and any therapist who is doing that should be reported.

I am a single child and had gone through what you are going through right now. I can totally understand you. You have every right to be angry and upset about the situation and one thing there is nothing wrong with you. At time I also felt lonely and did not wanted to contact anybody even my best friend. Then one day I just sat down completely silent and judged the situation not as their son but as an outsider. Here what my realization was, \n\nThe first thing they too are people. They are not perfect. They can behave like shit as much as we can. Before you were born, before they even met each other they were completely different individual with different dreams, different live and different sufferings. God know what type of situation they faced, what type of unfulfilled aspirations regarding life these two had that may be now coming out as poison in front of you and your brother. But these facts alone cannot justify what they are doing to you and your bro's mental health.\n\n  \nSecondly, it may sound harsh, its your life that you have to take care of buddy and your bro's too. Just because they are your parents you cannot allow them to destroy your life and no need to sacrifice your life for them. Find what ticks you in life in a good and positive way. Its your life my friend do not loose this golden time try to focus on you own shit. Trust whichever God you pray to and keep on doing your good work you life is worth more than these petty fights.\n\n  \nIn my case when these fights erupted I was all alone. I had the same thoughts. I fought like hell in my mind no to focus on these bullshit and started building my own world. I realized that at the end of the day I was their son may also develop these patterns in life. Sat them down on a room. Explained to them how these guys are just destroying my life. They never listened so I went into my work and finally was successful to achieve my goal in my workplace. Got some new friends and slowly enough my parents may be saw my success and started to realize that they may be hindering with their petty fights and just like that they too are now trying not to fight.\n\n  \nNow my parents are retired from their job although they sill fight and still donot talk to each other for sometimes and mother still do the same thing. But now they have come to the resolution in their own ways.\n\nOne thing I noticed that job also plays a factor to play a role in terms of these fights. Who knows what kind of things that your mom and dad has to listen on their job and when they come home all they do is fight because there may be lack of emotional regulation on both the sides.\n\nAt the end brother all I want to say is it is how I manage to survive this war. You will find your own way around it. In no way I am a professional in domestic conflict issue I am just a fellow survivor who manage to save their parents(luckily) from this vicious cycle of hate. You will have your scars but in now way there is a problem with you or your parents the problem lies with how we all in our society handles the situation. Its just my opinion and story that I shared hope it helps brother. May God give you the strengths I pray and have the belief that things will get better you will find a better way.",

Some good MPhil colleges are: NIMHANS, CIP, LGBRIMH, IHBAS, GMCH, KGMC, RML etc. If choosing a counsellor then: TISS and Ambedkar University (Delhi), but also look if they have done extra certifications (from reputed institutes) or have at least 3 years of experience or have a supervisor.\n\n3- Run as fast as you can if a therapist ever says anything resembling guarantee.

        "content": "Recently,\u00a0[u/St\\_Broseph](https://www.reddit.com/user/St_Broseph/), Dushyant had rescued a 23-year-old girl from Tiruvannamalai, a town in Tamil Nadu. He had saved her from a tyrannical family which was trying to control her and get her married off. Before leaving Tamil Nadu, the girl had recorded a video message of her from her own house stating that she is leaving home at her own accord and that she does not intend on coming back to her family. She then shared this video with all her family members, friends and relevant police authorities in Tiruvannamalai. She had also, upon reaching Bangalore, called the police control room and informed them that she is alive and well and had left at her own will. Yesterday, upon receiving information that a missing persons complaint was being lodged for the girl, the girl herself had contacted the Tiruvannamalai police and informed them that she has left out of her own will and even offered to video call them to show them she is okay. Dushyant had called the DSP and other police officers of Tiruvannamalai who didn\u2019t receive his calls. He had then texted him to inform him that no missing person\u2019s complaint should be taken because the girl was alive, well and safe. Broseph had even tweeted out to the Police authorities there telling them that he is not able to reach them. (Link to tweet below)  \n[https://x.com/St\\_Brosephs/status/1804183500645634108?t=KrcQ6QVIVjnA2jO6adco3Q&s=19](https://x.com/St_Brosephs/status/1804183500645634108?t=KrcQ6QVIVjnA2jO6adco3Q&s=19)\n\nAt around 2:30 AM today, 3 Tamil Nadu cops in civilian clothes along with the rescued girl\u2019s parents, in a civilian car showed up at Dushyant\u2019s doorstep. They did not show any identification apart from a picture of one of them in a policeman vardi. They asked him about the whereabouts of the girl and then attempted to drag him outside. He accompanied them to the main road where they proceeded to be abusive and aggressive. Then, still accompanied by these Tamil Nadu cops, he went to the Indiranagar police chowki nearby, where the cops were asleep.\n\nThe cops even after being awakened, were helpless and kept asking Dushyant to comply with the unreasonable Tamil Nadu cops. The Indiranagar cops along with the Tamil Nadu Cops and Dushyant went to the SBA Headquarters and started knocking on the door and ringing the bell. The Tamil Nadu Cops were still being extremely aggressive and by now had begun pushing and manhandling him when the people at Headquarters\u00a0 weren\u2019t opening the door because it was 4:30 AM ish in the morning by now. Frustrated by these things, these monsters tried to drag Dushyant towards the main road and put him into their civilian car. They used force and ganged up on him when he resisted this blatant abuse of power. They tried dragging him into a car and god knows what would\u2019ve happened if he were to go with them.\n\nBy this time Janhavi, got here and tried to support Dushyant. The HQ people had woken up by now and opened the door because of all the commotion. Seeing the HQ open, the girl\u2019s parents lunged inside. Janhavi ran to stop the girl\u2019s parents from trespassing into the HQ and possibly making things worse. She tried to stop the girl\u2019s father. This animal of a person, enraged by being stopped by Janhavi began to hit and punch her. This whole thing was further horrid because Cops from TWO JURISDICTIONS WERE PRESENT THERE AND DID NOTHING TO STOP JANHAVI FROM THIS ANIMAL EVEN AFTER THEY WERE ASKED TO. HE HURT HER SHOULDER, FACE AND KEPT GOING. Dushyant was near the main road and as soon as Janhavi pushed her head out of the door and screamed for help, he ran to her rescue while cops were still trying to restrain him physically. Dushyant had to physically move the assailant away from Janhavi to stop him from hitting her further. The Sub-Inspector of Indiranagar then got to the scene and asked everyone to head to the police station.\n\nEven after so much had transpired and such blatant disregard for law and order had been displayed, the cops at Indiranagar Police Station still tried to TAKE THE TAMIL NADU COPS\u2019 SIDE instead of treating this case on its facts. They were asking Dushyant to not escalate this legally and to comply with them. This whole incident shows how disgustingly entitled cops can get in Tamil Nadu and the height of incompetence shown by Indiranagar Police.\n\nDushyant has decided to pursue this legally. They have gotten medical attention and have medico legal cases. We will hold these abusive cops accountable for their lack of responsibility and blatant violation of procedure. These cops need to be SUSPENDED and the man who hit a FEMALE SOCIAL WORKER MERCILESSLY NEEDS TO BE PUT BEHIND BARS FOR HIS ACTIONS. We will do whatever it takes to bring these cops down because if cops turn a blind eye to crimes, refuse to follow procedure and act in such a brutal and disrespectful manner, are they even cops? Are these shameless scoundrels charged with our safety and protection? Imagine being in this situation instead of a resourceful person such as Broseph, anyone else would have been further assaulted, beaten and persecuted. We cannot rest until the perpetrators are arrested and the cops responsible for this are suspended and for this, we need your help. Follow and amplify St. Broseph posts on this incident across social media, call your journalist friends and inform them about what\u2019s happened, AMPLIFY THIS VOICE so that the law and order situation may improve and the next time a cop even considers doing something like this, they are reminded that\u00a0**PEOPLE OF BANGALORE WILL NOT STAY SILENT.**\n\ntl;dr\n\nDushyant, a social worker, rescued a girl from a controlling family. Tamil Nadu police and the girl's parents showed up at his doorstep at 2:30 AM to take her back. They assaulted Dushyant and another social worker, Janhavi, when they resisted. Bangalore police did nothing to help. Dushyant is calling for legal action against the police and the girl's father.",

Biharis are genetically suppossed to be around 170cm but the whole state except for the middle class and rich is stunted. Their are no corporate offices in that state and is always neglected by even their own politicians. Their is a competition for resources which creates brutality.

Then you get independence and the local goons get into the government and make it a Jungle Raj. This scenario has created a lot of problems and one could only dread of being brought up in that place. The generational trauma shows its results and a lot of people do retarded acts like stealing government property(These guys don't even leave bridges, yes they stole many bridges made of real concrete and steel). And a general lack of civic sense is also found in those people. The argumentative tone of insulting or devaluing an individual and the general urge to scam people. \n\n  \nThis is a brief intro if you want to have a true bihar experience then visit it and you will know. These are all the reasons for hate towards bihari immigrant workers by the locals of any given place in the country. It sets a stereotype in the mind of the average Joe.\n\nAnd also, there is a general competition of whose dick is larger in Indian society which creates a lot of hate towards even their own kin.\n\nThe solutions which I think will help the above case:-\n\n1. Lock up all the current popular political faces in Bihar forever with no communication to the outside world. Let them do their shit in a jail face-to-face with their political rivals.\n\n2. Reduce the population. Even though the vast majority of India's land is fertile and habitable, the population is just too much to bear. Our rail networks are reaching the maximum upgrd point with the current infra and civic sense and we aren't even able to provide clean water to our people. \n\n3. Start funding R&D and manufscturing. $20B were spent by indian govt. in 2023 while the chinese spent $450B.\n\n4. Start creating institutions in which people can lay their trust.\n\n5. Corruption.\n\n6. Regulation of food and safety in industrial spaces.\n\n7. Dealing with industrial waste. The capital is fucked up. It smells like piss in NYC? huhh. It smells like burning plastic, piss, sewers, rotten food, sulfur, etc. in Delhi. That abomination of a city drinks up the entire Yamuna River and then pisses it all downstream without any treatment. Their are millions of hectares of farmland that uses that piss to grow crops",
            "Well, if they can praise themselves for something they didn't do, might as well criticize them for it.",
            "Interesting, so would you also say Bihar tends to be more traditionally religious than surrounding regions?\n\n\n\u00a0And also, what is this called in Bhojpuri:\u00a0http://kingsjewelleryworld.com/product/14k-yellow-gold-cricket-band/ a men's bangle. It's worn in Indo-Caribbean communities (overwhelmingly of Bhojpuri(?) Bihari descent) by guys but it's always been called a \"cricket band\". Im wondering what the proper term for it is?\u00a0"
