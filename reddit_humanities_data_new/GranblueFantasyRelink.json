Is it the side story of the original? Or a completely original story with some connection here and there with the original?\n3. Will I be fine going in without almost any knowledge whatsoever about the world or story?\n4. How's the gameplay? Something like the FF7 remake? or DMC? or Monster Hunter? or Samurai Warriors?\n5. I think I read somewhere mention something about coop. Is it obligatory? Will I suffer playing solo?\n6. Does the game have microtransactions?

ProtoB was the original endgame, you should be running mostly-good V+ sigils, and they should be leveled.\n\nRosetta and Io are notoriously bad when played by AI. Rackam is okay-ish but not the best because he tends to squander some of his skills.\n\nThe best way to play Io is by animation canceling out of the aftercast from her charge attack. The AI will not do this. The AI is generally bad at correctly playing charge-based characters, and on Io it's even worse because the canceling is the only way to get great performance out of her.\n\nBeyond that, you'd have to post your build(s) for us to comb through.

It cuts your attack multiplier significantly (it seems multiplicative vs gains to attack multiplier?), but you can get around that by stacking more damage sigils.  It essentially halving your attack, but it's not touching the caps.  Very viable sigil on some characters",
