Both times I have successfully appealed because I wasn't breaking their rules I was just using the website too much. So I downloaded the app afterwards since I was told it was better to use the app. Then for some reason, I can access my account now, but I can't follow or like anyone's posts. I also checked in my instagram account to see for any restrictions and it said none, but as soon as I try to like or follow it says I'm restricted until the 24th of June. I am running a campaign account so I have to be active on it! Please help!! Do I just wait it out or what do I do? I am so afraid it puts another ban on me right after because that is what happened when I stopped being on instagram for a while and then it just banned me again.",

Thank you for reading. \nI'm racked with stress and worry - my instagram account has just been suspended (broke rules....apparently) and I think I did the selfie video correct.\n\nI'm just stressing. There are so many memories on my page of my late wife and late daughter. Most the people I follow and who follow me - we all have some sadness and trauma and we help each other. We shared pics of loved ones lost. Share memories.\n\nSince losing my daughter last year I've used instagram as this incredibly useful tool to kinda help myself and help others.\n\nI know it says 48 hours. I'm just worried as its my main outlet to speak with people - and there may be those who think I've done something 'stupid.'\n\nCan anyone help?\n\n1. Is there a way to fill in a form or speak with someone at instagram?\n2. Also if it does come back and I'm allowed to have my account again will it be as I left it (I.e all my posts and all my followers etc)\n3. Has anyone had this? Where you don't think you've done anything wrong but still suspended?\n4. Has anyone had this and irs been less or more than 48 hours?\n\nThank you. Sorry for the long post or if I've missed someone else talking about this. I'm just crippling sad and worried about it.\n\nThank you",

I assure you it was normal names, nothing ban worthy.\n\n\n\u00a0I don't want to exhaust all my choices of account name if this is going to keep happening, but I also don't see a way for them to help me.
