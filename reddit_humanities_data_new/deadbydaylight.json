Had to leave match and take DC penalty. Happened a few times between last night and this morning.",
            "Hooks and Portals have been fixed.  \nWhat about Gates and Pallets upstairs? That part of the map is unbereable for survivors .",
            "Most excited for the hooks change in the dungeon. Damn near impossible to hook if they go down in the main hallways.",
            ">Mirrored Illusion perk no longer charges when an illusion is already active\n\nBro WHY??? What is wrong with you guys it\u2019s already dogshit.",
            "so that weird bug where if you make a save for someone you end up being hooked immediately instead isn\u2019t fixed. very good!",
            "There's no way they didn't miss a bug pass on the Blight right? Please tell me it's fixed and just not in the notes.\n\nEDIT: Blessed Be",
            "Idk if this is just in console but about 40% of the time I either kick a gen, hook a survivor, or break a pallet, I get kicked from the match and it says that the server cannot be connected to",
            ">Fixed an issue in Garden of Joy where a Survivor could climb on the rock on the edge of the map\n\nDidn't know this was still in the game. Wasn't the map killswitched or something to fix this bug a while ago?",
            "Has there been any word on Bubba's bug where he enters the wall break animation when chainsaw sweeping through an already broken breakable wall? It has been happening to me very frequently on the most recent patch.\n\nThere's also the tantrum bug where he gains tantrum meter way too quickly and tantrums immediately upon charging chainsaw.\n\nHope those can get fixed soon.",
            ">Increased the volume on Flight of the Damned skeleton spawn to give better awareness to Survivors.\n\nSo this is the Flight of the Damned \"nerf\" the community was dreading?",

            "Is That Pallet In Forgotten Ruins\u2122 (you know the one) still there? If so, at this point I'm expecting them to just keep it as is.",
            ">Medkits no longer fully deplete when self-healing to 100% with no add-ons\n\nWas this change done for Syringes/Antiemostatic agents? Or was it done because of mangled?",
            "Nice of you to nerf the portals & the dungeon on the ruins map but not address the fact that you only have 4 terrible pallets above ground...",
            "\"The Dark Arrogance perk's bonus vault effect no longer incorrectly applies to other Killer abilities.\"\n\nHalf of Legion's power is \"vault fast\". Why is it no longer okay for vault speed increasing perks to work with Frenzy?  They worked with Frenzy just fine for ages, and part of it is that you have to sacrifice a perk slot that could have been used on slowdown or aura or basically anything else in order to get the increased vault speed. In most cases, it was just fun to use as many vault speed perks together as a build, for the sake of having the zoomies all over the place. Which again, isn't overly powerful as the most Legion can do during Frenzy is deep wound unless they've managed to get 4 Frenzy hits prior which is already a very uncommon event when playing against competent survivors on larger maps.",
            "THEY FUCKING NERFED MIRRORED ILLUSION WHAT THE FUCK?!",
            "What's the expected result for the medkit change? \n\nDidn't it already consume 100% charges if you didn't hit a great skill check?\n\nIf I heal my 10% remaining with a full medkit, will it deplete completely too?",
            "Did they fix that one pllet on Forgotten Ruins that can just be walked past?",

            "Are they just gonna keep ignoring the ds bug? On killers like huntress it's 1 second only and sometimes on all killers your animation can bug out causing you to not be able to vault",
            "> Increased the volume on Flight of the Damned skeleton spawn to give better awareness to Survivors.\n\nUnless I'm missing something on how skeleton spawns work, this seems like it's missing the mark. The issue is that skeletons are tangible instantly and can be spawned inside of a survivor with no counter. Making them louder is not gonna stop that.",
            "Can y'all please add pallets to the new map?? There are literally no loops and like 3 pallets up stairs",

            "Why nerf the sword? It was fine where it was.",
            ">Fixed an issue in Toba Landing where the Survivors could run on the railing of the stairs\n\nI KNEW THIS WAS POSSIBLE!\nall the times i tried and i maybe got it once or twice. Now it's perma gone but i knew it was a thing lol",
            " \n\n* *Fixed an issue where multiple recent Tomes were using the same cover color in the Compendium screen of The Archives.*  \n\n\nThe only thing here that mattered.",
            "How are people genuinely calling flight volume a broken nerf or anything. Anyone with a headset already hears and knows. This just helps people who are hard of hearing or use a TV for noise. I swear, yall whine and complain over the dumbest shit.",
            "So... No DS and Blight fix/killswitch? Also no mention of the bug where survivors can get hooked while trying to rescue someone being hooked from distance?\n\n\nLook I get the rescue bug might be hard to fix but you have a killswitch for a reason",
            "Cool that they added hooks to the bottom floor. Wish they would have done something about the 4 gen on the top floor, or the gates that touch each other, or the blight not getting fatigued by breaking pallets.\n\n\nEdit: They fixed the blight bug at least. The rest still stands, guess I'll just keep dying on the new map.",
            "Oh thank the lord!! Mirror illusion nerfs, BHVR NEVER fails to impress.",
            "Any plans to fix hit detection? It's been bugged for a year now, and has gotten incredibly noticeable since the Unreal 5 update?\n\nIn addition, any plans to fix Onryo's passive phasing?",
            "**There's an infinite loop on the Clown/Chapel map** with two interior windows spawning in a straight line with a mere distance of 8 meters from each other. Even if you break all the doors you cannot catch up. Now if survivors use their invitations they can entirely cut off the killer by blocking the vault itself so it's pretty much impossible to chase survivors through the mainbuilding in the current state.",
            "\"The Mirrored Illusion perk no longer charges when an Illusion is already active.\"\n\nWay to make an already bad perk worse.  \nWhat the actual heck is this change? LOL",
            "why do you hate survivors?",

            "That first part of the Misc section seems like a secret, much appreciated buff to Weave Attunement \ud83d\udc40",
            "Any word on the scratch marks bug? Ever since the engine change, scratch marks spawns have been weirdly spaced apart and often glitchy, like everyone has Lightweight. It's making tracking more difficult.",
            "Can you guys fix the big black circles under all the characters for switch players. You can see all the wraith and Sadako\u2019s coming a mile away when they\u2019re invisible lol, plus you can see who\u2019s hiding in lockers.",
            "So more hooks in the dungeon and you moved the portal to the side of the window and didnt add one on the other side and also didnt add any pallets/tiles to the top. Does this make Forgotten Ruins the most killer sided map in the game? At least with Grave of Glenvale there is pallets and those window loops.",
            "The good window in the dungeon was closed... damn.",
            "Not fixed :\n\nBubba has 3 second tantrum threshold which makes engraving and deep rauke impossible to play.\n\nPig and Ghostface has wrong Carry Animations. The run like on crack without agitation.\n\nPig has third person right arm animation. Her right arm always going right when you turning right.\n\nPig has a lock on when she wipe her weapon.\n\nNurse is bugged. Which gives me motion sickness. Her Fatique is bugged. and has a inbuild decrease fov.\n\nAnd you doesnt fixed the DS Bug.\n\n  \nIn the Forgotten Ruins Map, at least 4 hooks will now always be available in the dungeon section of the map.\n\nI will never understand your balance or game designer choice. when you creating such dungeon and give before only 2 hooks or whatever. no wonder that everyone running in a area where the killer cant hooking someone.",
            "Is DS still bugged? Getting hit by DS is much longer than 4 seconds (feels like 6?) on some killers. While enduring makes it like 2 seconds on others?",
            "Drop cross progression please bro",
            "Why would you nerf the iridescent addon? That was too much, you always do too much when nerfing killers. And giving the ring a useless niche use? All of this a month after people bought the DLC. You did it again BHVR, like with Ash, Wesker and many others. Nerfs come really fast but fixes for killers? You took years to fix blight and remove MadeForThis even when you people knew it was stupid. I feel stupid for buying something that you people later RUIN. Next time I'll wait for the nerfs before even THINKING about buying shit\n\nEdit: When will you fix Decisive strike?? The stun is not consistent and is FAR longer than 4 seconds....",
            "Still no fix for the bp loss?",
            "Maybe now Mage Hand will no longer be a free hit finally.",
            "Still no word on the Huntress hatchets not dealing damage or the inertia bug on her.\n\nIt's been 2 months.",
            "Vecna still playable, thanks \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udfff",
            "Not sure you needed to shorten time for Killers to take the passage, just increase the time it took for a survivor to take it but at the same time the numbers are small enough it should be fine.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\"Bugfix\" nerf to an already weak perk. IMO you could just make Mirrored Illusion/Blast Mine/Wire Tap/Chemical Trap work on tokens instead (repairing 50% of a gen grants a token, spend a token to install the \"trap\") and it wouldn't really hurt anything.\u00a0\n\n\nI don't expect any changes to event mechanics since its a temporary gamemode tbh. The bugs and balance are very scuffed but it'll only be around for another few weeks so I can see them thinking \"why bother?\", which is kind of fair I guess. I'll just avoid playing it since the 150% bonus probably isn't worth my sanity.\n\n\nEDIT: LoPro Blight confirmed fixed in comments, hallelujah.",
            "So they making new map who is killer sided much more killer sided. Awesome adjustmenet. What about the gates that is impossible to open in 1v1 situation, what about camping gen in upper part of the map. The killer has no interest going to dungeon, he can camp gens above the ground and easliy win",
            "So the most killer sided map in the game gets a buff to be even more killer sided, but they can't fix a pellet that's floating in the air? Lmao",
            "Did they fix the one top side pallet that wasn't really a pallet? The one the killer could just walk right around and smack you  if dropped at all. \n\nForgotten Ruins needs a pass through on the top side, hell, take a couple of pallets from the dungeon area and put them up top, balance it to be a bit more equal. Makes the dungeon more bearable for killers, and top side 4 gen is no longer a completely hopeless situation for survivors.",
            "At last, no more cluelessly walking around the dungeon with a survivor on my shoulder",
            "Now all that\u2019s left is fixing the exit gates on that map",
            "They buffed killer on Forgotten Realms? The devs really are brain dead.",
            "So the Toba Landing stairs are fixed, but no note on the outer RPD stairs?",

            "Wait\u2026 Archives having the same color in the compendium was a bug? I\u2019m glad, that bugged me really hard.",
            ">Fixed an issue with the blight not entering the fatigue state when destroying walls and pallets\n\nAh, but didn't fix the occasional double syringe after doing so. Very cool!",
            "did they fix the ui with vecna where his spells stay on the screen after using them?",
            "So *that* pallet on Forgotten Ruins is intended and not a bug? All I can do is chuckle at that. Truly BHVR logic at play.",

            "Will the bug that has switched Jane and Ash in the character menu ever be fixed? As a proud Jane main, I go to click to play Jane and muscle memory has me selecting Ash. It\u2019s the least impactful bug ever, but I\u2019m sure Ash and Jane mains are both annoyed lol.",

            "I am a mix of relieved, annoyed and confused by those **Vecna changes**\n\n>Increased Mage Hand pallet lifting time from 0.35 seconds to 0.5 seconds.\n\nOk not *that* bad, but I was also using **Telekinetic Ring** which is also gutted (see below). Probably will need to readjust to aim at **blocking pallets now**, but it definitely will no longer result in free hits every time now. Which is fair, unless it is now completely useless, which would suck because it was my favorite power to use.\n\n>Increased the volume on Flight of the Damned skeleton spawn to give better awareness to Survivors.\n\nI didn't think survivors needed this effect to be *easier* to dodge honestly. Ignoring fully clueless survivors outliers, even from outside line of sight or at longer range, it only gets a hit when the Survivor is **mid-animation** which required precise timing and prediction or after they dodge by crouching but I use it with a **timing that it gives me an M1**, which also requires timing and prediction, it is not *as free* as it looks. Even behind walls or at longer range, I *never* get a hit anymore with this power except with those 2 situations. Even the **insta cast from the initial hitbox** if used at just the right range is clearly not working as much as it did *just last week*, survivors have adapted as I knew they would. And if they can see it, they won't even crouch and sidestep it and not even lose distance. Not saying the spell is bad or useless, but if anything I could see it getting a small buff to those hitboxes or reducing the cone spread.\n\nIt is really odd to me that of all the things this power could be changed to, volume is what they went for, I can't imagine a single survivor will find it useful.\n\n>Addon Ring of Telekinesis: Activating Mage Hand on an Upward pallet increases your general vault Speed by 10% for the next 8 seconds.\n\nHorrible, absolutely trash, I *hate* it when any devs do that in any game. And I find it weird to tie a vault buff from an interaction with a pallet, with a duration probably too short that it would often apply and most definitely too low so that it makes a difference. Went from arguably the best add-on, at least in common+yellow, to maybe the worst? What I *hoped* they would do is **remove the activation speed to add to the duration instead**. Because that way you remove the free hits from the current activation speed (which *had* to change), but you can trap/fool survivors thinking they can make another loop and redrop the pallet, and +1 or +2 seconds would surprised them and you get a not-free hit. *And then* they'd had to **figure out I run this add-on and adapt**, which is positive overall to the game and what you should always aim for add-ons to do, **reward game knowledge with counterplay and avoid inescapable situations**.\n\nI said it before ever since **Vecna** was announced and since the PTB, he is my favorite design in the game, I'm a veteran D&D player and am emotionally attached to his more than any other IP in the game, and **I'll try to main him even if he becomes the worst killer in the game**. As long as he remains *fun* at least, which admittedly is correlated to his performance but not as much as it would for some other Killer mains.",

            ">It what world is it too strong\n\nAny hit that is nigh upon guaranteed just for pressing a button is bad imo. Every 38 seconds (34 or even less with addons), vecna gets a free health state. On top of mage hand, being a 115 killer, having a catchup tool, etc. It makes his regular counterplay (or really any counterplay) unsafe.\n\n>can be avoided by crouching early when you see the windup animation\n\nWhich vecna can fake or even skip altogether with *another* tech that allows you to throw out a spell without the casting animation. Even in the best circumstances (without skipping the animation), this requires you to: have line of sight of Vecna, be actively looking at him, immediately differentiate between multiple different casting animations, avoid any animation locks such as vaulting a window or dropping a pallet, hope that he doesn't fake it for distance, then crouch for more than half a second as he catches up. If any of those don't happen, free hit. And even then, if vecna makes enough distance, he can still get an m1 off.\n\nThe counterplay is far too specific, far too difficult, and far too inconsistent for an ability that is not only pretty easy to use, but is also on a killer who has 3 other abilities.\n\nThere needs to be a happy medium with flight otherwise it'll be miserable for one side or the other depending on vecna's knowledge of the tech. The spacing really isn't that hard to judge once you get it down; I only played vecna for a few days and I was already hitting instatechs like 75% of the time",
            "It IS uncounterable if the killer is smart enough to use it when theyre very close, usually through a wall or directly on the other side of a thin loop. That's what they mean when they call it an \"insta tech\", even if you crouch the millisecond you hear it activate you're still getting hit, it basically hits you immediately on spawn.",
            "I would argue that dream pallets get value more often than flight of the damned does. Unless survivor comms are literally comp level, then someone is falling for them at least a few times during a match, which gets you a hit. Before I figured out instatech was a thing, I got maybe an average of 0.75 injuries with flight per match. 1 being *generous*",
            "Dream pallets should be basekit with snares",

            "no problem :P Also , pretty please would you mind putting on your whiteboard the plan to take a look at Nemesis's addons and give them a little shakeup? :3",
            "It's all about the mindgames with the hand and the skeletons, saying it's a guaranteed hit upon using the power isn't fair because the counterplay happens before that.",
            "Same person that asked specifically for your opinion.",
            "Fair enough. Figured their vault was more than fast enough in power.",
            "Yes I know. Which is why I listed all of the things you have to do simultaneously *before* he casts flight. If any single one of them isn't done within a split second then you're getting hit unless the killer fucks up. \n\nDon't have line of sight? You get hit because you can't react to the cast. Or you path super strangely as a preventative measure and risk vecna gaining enough distance for an m1. You don't know the 4 stances well enough to tell them apart at a glance and immediately react? You get hit. You move your camera off Vecna so that you can path correctly through a loop? If he casts, you get hit. Vault a window, drop or vault a pallet? If he casts, you get hit. React correctly and precrouch? He can just let go of m2, gain distance, and m1 you down like pyramid head.\n\nIt's a frankly ludicrous amount of things you have to do to even have a chance of counterplaying *one* of Vecna's spells. If it were a 50/50 sort of thing I wouldn't mind. But it's very much not",
            "But that's all just things you have to learn to play against the killer. I don't think it's that different from learning to play against other killers with similar powers.",
            "It's different in the ways that matter. I'll use pyramid head as an example since it's the closest thing to flight of the damned. In addition to the things you do for flight (line of sight, visual cue (which is longer and easier to discern than vecna's), avoiding animation locks, etc.), you *also* get a gigantic sound cue when he puts his sword in the ground that can very easily be heard anywhere within range of punishment, *and* a visual cue when he fires that is actually properly reactable even through walls. And even still, pyramid head is one of the stronger killers in the game. Flight of the damned has neither of those things if instatech is taken into account\n\nEven if you learn the counters to instatech, they're not consistent enough to be a reliable defense against the power. If the vecna player knows the distance, then he's getting a hit the vast majority of the time because of all the ways he can remove that counterplay. Pyramid head is A tier yet still has loads more counterplay than one of vecna's four powers. Yes, the cooldown makes it less of a win button than it would be otherwise, but anything with that little interaction just isn't a good thing imo."

Read on as we divulge all the major changes making their way to the game, including updates to Killers, Perk changes, quality of life improvements and more.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/evc6ogo9dq7d1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c465ad9267afce9faac66af52fa4fe2b95875cbf\n\n* \\[NEW\\] Added ability to manually swap between guards.\n\n*Dev note: Each guard has a specialty, so we\u2019ve added the ability to choose the right guard for each situation. This will provide a nice boost in power and quality of life.*\n\n* \\[NEW\\] Patrol paths must be at least 10 meters in length.\n* \\[NEW\\] Added a multiplier to guard hunt time based on path length. Longer paths increase hunt time up to a maximum 1.5x the normal duration.\n* \\[NEW\\] When The Knight is within 8 meters of his guard, the guard\u2019s hunt timer depletes 3x faster.\n\n*Dev note: Dropping a guard at your feet in a loop is often the best choice but leaves little counterplay for the Survivor. We\u2019ve added incentives for longer paths and improved counterplay when someone is being chased by both The Knight and his guard at the same time.*\n\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Reduced The Carnifex\u2019s hunt time to 12 seconds (was 24 seconds).\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Increased The Jailer\u2019s hunt time to 24 seconds (was 12 seconds).\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Reduced The Carnifex\u2019s banner spawn time to 5 seconds (was 10 seconds).\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Increased The Jailer\u2019s banner spawn time to 10 seconds (was 5 seconds).\n\n*Dev note: The Carnifex was previously the best at both breaking things and keeping Survivors occupied, making him the best choice for multiple scenarios. We\u2019ve swapped these hunt times (and their associated banner spawn times) around, making The Jailer the specialist for patrolling and chasing the longest.*\n\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Decreased The Carnifex\u2019s breaking time to 1.8 seconds (was 2 seconds).\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Decreased The Assassin\u2019s breaking time to 5 seconds (was 6 seconds).\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Decreased The Jailer\u2019s breaking time to 5 seconds (was 6 seconds).\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Increased The Carnifex\u2019s detection range to 10 meters (was 8 meters).\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Increased The Assassin\u2019s detection range to 10 meters (was 8 meters).\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Increased The Jailer\u2019s detection range to 16 meters (was 14 meters).\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Updated various Add-Ons.\n\n*Dev note: Map of the Realm and Pillaged Mead were fan-favorite Add-Ons, so we have incorporated some of their effects into the base kit. We\u2019ve reviewed many of The Knight\u2019s Add-Ons to bring the strongest and weakest Add-Ons closer together.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ij2hk0kcdq7d1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=7776b0d3efe6678f065d3cd587a506122c94f1eb\n\n* \\[NEW\\] Taking control of a Biopod will now cause it to aim at the nearest Survivor within line of sight.\n* \\[NEW\\] After 0.25 seconds, targeting progress now decays over the next 0.5 seconds.\n* \\[CHANGE\\] When controlling a Biopod, Survivor now only glow if they can be targeted.\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Decreased Biopod targeting cooldown after Sipstreaming a Survivor to 3 seconds (was 3.5 seconds).\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Improved UI when using Biopods and when shooting with the Killer.\n\n*Dev note: The Singularity can be hard to learn but deadly when mastered, so we\u2019ve made some adjustments to make targeting Survivors with Biopods easier. These changes won\u2019t have a significant effect on those who have already mastered The Singularity.*\n\n* \\[NEW\\] Added the ability to destroy the currently controlled Biopod.\n* \\[CHANGE\\] The Killer can now hear audio by default when controlling a Biopod.\n\n*Dev note: Some quality of life improvements! Biopods now have audio without needing an Add-On, and you can now destroy a Biopod from a distance as long as it is not disabled.*\n\n* \\[NEW\\] The Killer now receives Killer Instinct when a Survivor is Slipstreamed.\n* \\[CHANGE\\] The last controlled Biopod has its aura revealed in yellow for 10 seconds (was 5 seconds).\n\n*Dev note: Switching between Biopods and The Singularity can be disorienting, so we\u2019ve made some changes to help players get their bearings and find targets.*\n\n* \\[NEW\\] The Singularity gains 3% Haste while in Overclock mode.\n* \\[REMOVED\\] Overclock\u2019s duration no longer scales with the number of Slipstreamed Survivors.\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Increased Overclock\u2019s base duration to 5.7 seconds (was 4.7 seconds).\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Stuns caused by Perks (such as Head On, Blast Mine) during Overclock mode will now cause Overheat.\n\n*Dev note: The Soma Family Photo Add-On was much loved, so we\u2019ve added part of its effect to the base kit. To simplify Overclock, we have removed the scaling duration and bumped up the time to 5.7 seconds.*\n\n* \\[NEW\\] Added an aim assist effect to shooting a Slipstreamed Survivor.\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Increased an aim assist when creating a Biopods.\n\n*Dev note: When attempting to teleport to a Survivor or place a Biopod, a slight change could cause your shot to miss or become an invalid spot for a Biopod, causing it to do nothing. We have improved the aim assist to linger slightly longer on the last valid place or Slipstreamed Survivor.*\n\n* \\[NEW\\] Passive EMP printing at Supply Cases is now limited to 97%. The remaining progress must be done manually by a Survivor.\n* \\[NEW\\] Supply Cases that have reached the passive printing limit now have their auras revealed in yellow.\n* \\[NEW\\] Disabled Biopods will pulse shortly before they are reactivated.\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Decreased the aura reading range of Supply Cases to 28 meters (was 32 meters).\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Increased range of EMPs to 10 meters (was 8 meters).\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Decrease immunity to Slipstream after using an EMP to 0.35 seconds (was 2 seconds).\n\n*Dev note: EMPs are an essential tool to playing against The Singularity, but they can be too plentiful at times, making it hard for The Killer to use their Power. Survivors will now need to spend a little more time to acquire EMPs, and they won\u2019t be protected from further Slipstreams after using one. We\u2019ve added new VFX to Biopods to let Survivors know when a pod that has been disabled is about to reactivate.*\n\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Reduced the time it takes to switch back to The Singularity to 0.5 seconds (was 1 second).\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Reduced the time it takes to switch back to The Singularity when near a hooked Survivor to 1.5 seconds (was 5 seconds).\n\n*Dev note: Since the introduction of the Anti-Facecamp system, this penalty became a little redundant as staying near a hooked Survivor now carries its own risks. We\u2019ve reduced this penalty, though accessing Biopods next to a hooked Survivor still may not be ideal. We have also reduced the base wake-up time to make swapping back to The Singularity feel more responsive.*\n\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Updated various Add-Ons.\n\n*Dev note: We have review The Singularity\u2019s Add-Ons, giving some new effects and balance tweaks to others.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z2kro3zfdq7d1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d0deb185b862d605d806024b682558766cd4c1d\n\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Increased aura reveal duration to 6/7/8 seconds (was 3/4/5 seconds).\n\n*Dev note: With a longer duration, it will be easier to take advantage of the aura reveal and allow this Perk to be used more aggressively in a chase.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/75g93wqidq7d1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc7c15dbe5214380594b592823bb2f2a0b87f0d7\n\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Reduced cooldown to 60/45/30 seconds (was 60/50/40 seconds).\n\n*Dev note: I\u2019m All Ears can be very useful, but currently has a fairly long cooldown. We have reduced the cooldown so the Perk comes into play more often.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1mu7oqzkdq7d1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8973b76957d04ff4434d6f3785331f10f2c1c22e\n\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Reduced cooldown to 60/45/30 seconds (was 80/70/60 seconds).\n\n*Dev note: Trail of Torment similarly has a long cooldown. We have reduced this as well to allow its effect to happen more often.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m866f62ndq7d1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bf90435b29a977f1c353d442d8c0989d6722741\n\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Reduced cooldown to 60/50/40 seconds (was 120/100/80 seconds).\n\n*Dev note: Oppression had a very long cooldown, so we have cut it in half.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hufizz5pdq7d1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1052827484f3b71c6a2fcbc007eef160bd743e94\n\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Reduced cooldown to 60/50/40 seconds (was 120/100/80 seconds).\n\n*Dev note: This is not a copying and pasting error, we\u2019ve done the exact same thing for Dragon\u2019s Grip!*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yr10oq1rdq7d1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bb0bab7fc88bac9f0ce77273c3807303f471b80\n\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Increased duration to 40/50/60 seconds (was 20/25/30 seconds).\n\n*Dev note: Getting Machine Learning to active can be tricky, so we\u2019ve extended its duration to help the Killer get value out of it when it does.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ba0l7wsdq7d1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=700a2e40bca61f484aed240ab5bf6f0dfaf97a2a\n\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Decreased starting skill check penalty to -15% (was -25%).\n\n*Dev note: Autodidact can become very strong (with some luck) later in the match, but the large penalty often means it\u2019ll do more harm than good. We\u2019ve toned down this penalty to make it a little more consistent and improve its strength once you\u2019ve built up your tokens.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ct797sydq7d1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecf68f5ee3843678c0f8d862dec2b631dd70064a\n\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Increased healing speed bonus to 30% (was 10%).\n\n*Dev note: Empathic Connection is great for showing injured Survivors where you are, but the healing speed bonus is a bit low. We have increased the speed at which you heal others to 30%.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sa8m3co0eq7d1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=09b2a0669ccba6b4157051a7d40b9546bb625ab3\n\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Grunts of pain are reduced by 80/90/100% (was 25/50/75%).\n\n*Dev note: Iron Will already makes Survivors fairly quiet, but even the slightest noise can give away your position. We have increased the effects of the Perk and reduced the gap between tiers to make lower tiers more useful.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d0b9bv73eq7d1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5deafe20d4f92250703b27ee36da3afe3d52ac61\n\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Increased healing granted after being unhooked to 50/60/70% (was 40/45/50%).\n\n*Dev note: Resurgence is currently a little weak, and since it can only activate twice per match, we have increased the healing it grants.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gbcyfc55eq7d1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1522031ee2184c4e9fec2274e8fe43e618cf4006\n\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Increased healing conversion rate to 50/60/70% (was 40/45/50%).\n\n*Dev note: Solidarity can be a little tricky to use, requiring you to be injured and find another injured Survivor to heal. We have increased the conversion rate to make it even more impactful when it comes into play.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpkdjf77eq7d1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff9012438f94e7a0fa642028107bec028bdbde67\n\n* \\[CHANGE\\] Increased duration of Haste and pools of blood hiding to 20/25/30 seconds (was 4/6/8 seconds).\n\n*Dev note: Babysitter\u2019s duration was low, causing it to not provide much value before it ran out. We have extended its duration significantly to make it more impactful.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u3fu9i79eq7d1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c9251754c178d2946bfa7c4bd82bb9cc7deb632\n\n* \\[NEW\\] Hooks that a Survivor has been sacrificed on will repair themselves after 60 seconds.\n\n*Dev note: With hooks remaining permanently broken, it could create some deadzones where it was impossible to get a Survivor to a hook before they could wiggle free. Now when a Survivor is sacrificed on a hook, it will automatically be repaired after 60 seconds.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j7ko9gmbeq7d1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6769b9d4badf62fe1256b8bc893d81ff7fa3462\n\n* \\[NEW\\] Added layout variations to Yamaoka Estate maps.\n* \\[NEW\\] Added layout variations to the Mount Ormond Resort map.\n\n*Dev note: We have added new possible layouts for each of these three maps. While the layout of these variants are different, they\u2019ll include the same iconic features (landmarks, decorations, etc.) and are a similar size to the originals.*\n\nUntil next time\u2026\n\nThe Dead by Daylight team",

Anytime I play him, I love setting long patrols and trying to catch people off-guard - but it never works, and typically the guard is just good to try and corral a survivor towards you... Which you can't do anymore since their hunt timer depletes too fast when close, apparently.\n\nI mean, it's literally child's play to kite the guards near windows and mess up their pathing so bad they're never going to catch you. Without the Knight nearby to make use of the guard's distraction, he's probably never going to get any hits on survivors while making use of his power.

The other guard buffs are meaningless as their pathing and AI are garbage, nobody is getting hit by a guard - Its the fact that they forced the survivor into a path so YOU could hit them, but you can't use them in chase anymore so... what's the point? The only guard-hit possible is if you were to snipe someone with the Assassin, but if youre sniping at range they can just grab the banner themselves, again the chase AI is garbage (iirc Otz or Henz has a vid where they run them in a circle within 5m for the entire hunt)\n\nAll he needed was choosing which guard, basekit Map of Realm (which they did 50% of, decent I guess), and bugfixes.

My only question thus becomes, where does the Assassin fit in? 5 second banner spawn means you can't use him to harass survivors, and his increased pressure in a chase due to higher move speed can't be taken advantage of anymore since he'll just despawn after 4 seconds now...\n\nIf they want Knight to be a purely macro focused killer they need to increase the spawn time for banners across the board.",

So I see no reason to expect that you lose the ability to smash pallets with carnifex mid-chase.\n\nPersonally I wish they didnt speed up the pallet smashing of a regular guard though. There's a trick I like to shoot for with killer shack and other god pallets where you can set a non-carnifex guard to breaking the pallet and block its use by the survivor.S o if you bamboozle the window or hit a god pallet you can trap a survivor into getting hit. But it requires setting up in the first place.",
            "Honestly that single change with the Knight requiring 10m is my only complaint with this patch.  His Anti-Loop was annoying sure but not oppressively so since smart Survivors that paid attention could spot him setting it up and abandon the loop well before he finished the animation in the first place.  As it is now The Knight basically becomes Trapper during Chase, except Worse cause at least Trapper could push you into a trapped loop.  In the  time it takes Knight to draw out that 10m line Survivors will easily just see him and run a mile away, making his kit only useful for Anti-Gen strats.. and didn't we literally just do several waves of patches trying to heavily discourage that playstyle?\n\nI just don't know, this feels alarmingly bad for what was already a pretty mid and enjoyable Killer. If they really don't want  Knight to Anti-Loop they're better off just reworking him entirely cause that was the only good thing he had left.\n\n  \nEDIT: I will say on an unrelated note that I'm also cautiously worried about the Empathic Connection buff. I was already running a \"Medic\" build with it (Empathy/Empathic Connection/Botany Knowledge/Aftercare) and getting heals off pretty quick.. an additional 20% healing Speed may tip these builds into absurd territory, especially if they add in a Circle of Healing to the mix.",

With Jailer, if my math is right, you can have him chase a survivor for up to 36 seconds!\n\nSurvivors will need to figure out pathing and play for the Banner a lot more than they do right now, which will be good considering the Knight can't chase alongside his guards as much.

But my \"people won't like it still\" mainly comes from DBD content creators being a lil salty seeing it sometimes, causing people in games to be a lil salty seeing it, and then it becomes the SM effect, where people didn't like old skull merchant and even when updated their preconceived notions remain.",

Now he has to go 10 meters to place a guard and the guards chase meter tanks when you're near it?? And the banner spawns faster????? I mean it's pretty much pointless to even use a guard for any means of chasing. You can still break shit and kick gens from a distance I guess.......... At least their detection meter is bigger.",

It doesn\u2019t matter that the unhooked person is stealthy if they\u2019re followed by someone who isn\u2019t. It is the unhooker that actually needs the information to know whether they should follow and heal, or just fuck off to avoid taking killer straight back to the unhooked person.

Because as much as I love knight, as survivor there isnt much you can do when you get chased by a guard and the knight in one small loop. There isn't much counterplay to that. I don't understand why they butchered the chase timers and made the banner spawn faster?????? Even as survivor, as much as I play knight, I understand if the knight isn't chasing me with the guard, and it some instances even when he is chasing me with a guard..... I can do a fucking loopty loop around something and double right back and pick up the banner and get away for free... So now it spawns even faster and the knight gets punished for chasing with his guard to prevent the banner pick up?? Wtf is the point of using your guards for chasing?????? Any survivors that have any understanding of how knight works are going to walk all over him now... It's kinda shitty to be honest.",

            "Unironically I think a deathclaw killer would be similar to legion\n\nIts main power would be pretty much legions rush, but it only takes 3 hits to get to the down instead of legions 4, and the animation is goring the survivor.\n\nIf it's a fallout 3/NV deathclaw then it could have a baby deathclaw that it can summon to do tasks for it, similar to knights guards, the difference is instead of a time limit or a flag, or summoning wherever you sent it. It'll come from the closest locker and either do the task you gave, or patrol the area nearby, chasing the first survivor it finds. It'll act kinda like a zombie where it's not much of an actual deterrent, but you can kill it with a pallet or head on. The difference is a flashlight blind or a loud noise like a flashbang (even if it doesn't blind) or failing a skill check will scare it and send it back, which means a viable defense is also blast mine on the generator to prevent it from successfully damaging it. \n\n\nAnything else I should add or would a legion X knight deathclaw be too strong?",

I can see some of the Fallout protagonists being able to win- maybe even a couple of the wasteland badasses if they\u2019re willing to wear the armour. But most people would probably lose- they just wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up.",

            "I'm just entirely guessing here but I think they just recorded normal game animations and map separately and then put in the animations of the power armour model on top of it.  I don't think they fully rendered the map and props themselves other than the power armour which was just put on top of what was recorded.  I could be totally wrong here but it just seems like what is most likely.",
            "Everything in this video is in the same 3D scene.\n\n* You can't have that 3rd person camera angle in-game.\n* Legion's red stain is just a spotlight.\n* Everything has multiple shadows. That is because there are multiple light sources above the school. Not how it works in game. \n\nThat's why i am agitated by OP's response - they're telling me you can't rip map data when they clearly did so. The scene entirely consists of exported game geometry. And layout of the scene is pretty accurate to the game. Hats off to OP if it was rebuilt with such accuracy by hand though, but why didn't they just say so."
