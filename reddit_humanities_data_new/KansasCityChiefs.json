            "Scriptwriter lazy confirmed :)",
            "I don\u2019t think those games are really all that comparable. Mahomes struggled in the first half, but he came out and tore them a new one in the second half. Frankly he vastly out performed Brady who threw 2 picks and should have lost the game on a third.\n\nCompare that to the Ravens game, Lamar just straight up didn\u2019t look ready for the moment.\u00a0\n\nFrankly the biggest similarity between the two is that the Chiefs deserved to win.",
            "Lamar has been in the league for one less season than Mahomes. Like yeah Lamar has been hurt and hasn\u2019t played in as many playoff games, but I don\u2019t know if I really would call Lamar less experienced than Mahomes in anything other than super bowls\u2026\n\nAlso the patriots were still in the midst (albeit the end) of an incredible run of winning over almost two decades. I\u2019m not sure the hate for Mahomes and the Chiefs is even close to what it was for the Patriots. Give it another 10 years though\u2026",
            "What were you right about? That KC would beat Baltimore?",
            "Calling Lamar Jackson less experienced is a stretch.  Sure mahomes has played more games but not by anywhere near the margin between Brady and Mahomes in 2019",
            "2019 and 2023: Ravens and 49ers were the 1 seed, Chiefs win the AFC to beat the Niners in the Super Bowl",
            "Good flex op",
            "Don't forget the roughing the QB call on Chris Jones. To me, that was the real error. I'm still fucking mad about that.",
            "Yeah. Dee ford, and the rest of the defense lost us that game, mahomes played just as good if not better than brady",
            "Hear hear!",
            "Scriptwriter only know eat hot chip and lie",
            "Mahomes was facing the number 1 defense and they put up 17 points in the fourth quarter to send it to overtime. Hell they put up 31 in the second half after being down 14-0. That same defense held the rams to 3 points the next game. \n\nSure the ravens receiver let him down with the fumble on the first play of the fourth, but they got the ball twice after that and could only get 3 points. What\u2019s even more telling is people said they should have ran more instead of letting him throw. \n\nAlso putting it this way makes it sound like Mahomes is the old veteran player but he only came out a year earlier and they both took over their teams in 2018 albeit Jackson took over midway through the season.",
            "Yea, Mahomes wasn't outplayed by Brady. \n\nMahomes drove his team down with what just under a minute and one timeout? Into field goal range to send the game into overtime. Hell, had we had a bit more time or an extra timeout, Mahomes might have been able to win it outright in regulation. \n\nMahomes simply didn't get another chance in overtime because the Patriots won the toss and Sutton couldn't make an adjustment to save his life and allowed the Patriots to make *three* third and long conversions to win the game. \n\nThat game is a reflection of Brady's greatness no doubt, but Mahomes was ready for the moment. It's somewhat like the 2021 AFC divisional, where winning that game is a reflection of Mahomes' greatness, not of Allen doing anything wrong/losing.",
            "Ya comparing last years Lamar to first year starting Mahomes is not the same by any stretch. It was his second mvp season for crying out loud",
            "There's hardly anything to be \"right about\". If you were calling it before the season that the chiefs would beat \\#1 seeded Ravens at home in the playoffs, that's something to be \"right about\". \n\nOtherwise... I mean what would a KC fan say \"oh yea we are going to beat the Ravens, but lose in the SB\"? \n\nlol, 99% of Chiefs fans were \"right\" then \ud83d\ude02",
            "And don\u2019t forget the punt kicked to the Pats that was called a fumble and was overturned when it shouldn\u2019t have been.\n\nDefinitely not blaming any of the calls here though. Our defense lost us that game. Plain and simple.",
            "But the way his fingertip brushed Brady's face mask was just so...*violent* \n\nI'm just glad Brady was okay.  Rivalries aside, I don't want him having lifelong health complications from such violent, illegal plays.",
            "Still mad Andy never called timeout in OT. Brady waltzed down the field.",
            "Yeah, and just think if Dee Ford isnt offsides I fully believe we win that Super Bowl and can you just hear all that dynasty talk would sound like now",
            "I've made peace with that play. They had footage from every possible angle. And from every angle, it NEVER shows it hitting Edelman. In isolation, every angle you watch, you'll think \"OK this one proves nothing, but surely another angle will?\" But angle after angle, it's the same thing. So, in aggregate, after looking at all angles, the only logical conclusion was that Edelman never touched the ball.\n\nIt sucks for us, but the refs got it right.\n\nThat Chris Jones RTP on the other hand......",
            "What are you talking about? \n\nThat was 100% NOT A FUMBLE and all replays immediately showed dieter hitting the ball before anyone else..",
            "He slapped Brady's shoulder pad, ffs!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UVIp-N6LhI4?si=BYBUeGiPDSnoGR44",
            "It really didn't matter at that point.  We lost as soon as we lost that coin flip and the defense had to take the field.",
            "Or the shitty 2nd half against the Bungles lol. We would have crushed the Rams.",
            "Or maybe it means Sutton doesn't get fired that year.. we don't get Spags and maybe 2018 is our only trophy.",
            "That's not true we got them in 3rd and long at least 3 times on that OT drive.  Brady deserves a lot credit for sustaining that drive."
