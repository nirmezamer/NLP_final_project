We figured it out because there was a GIANT bull standing in the road, staring us down. He won, we left. \n\nAnother time, I was driving down the main road, and there were two cows on the side of the road. One was calmly eating grass, but the other was scared, and would buck anytime a car drove past. I called 911, and it was the first they'd heard about it.
