If they spark up a conversation i keep it polite and contribute. Ya kno being a human..i understand some people cant/wont be like that but i dont see whats wrong with actual face time not screen time conversations. Edit to add in my wife is in the camp that this is weird but dude was a bitch for recording and trying to shame her so there is that.

The guy I was responding to was saying that the act of filming someone else in public without their consent should be illegal (except if they\u2019re in the background). \n\nOf course, the way courts work is you go to court and prove stuff. My point is that this will further burden the justice system with bullshit court cases, and force people to take time off work, pay lawyers fees etc for their defense. It gives police another way to inconvenience you, because if filming in public was a crime they could ticket/arrest you for it. If you hold up your phone the wrong way and cops just \u201cthink\u201d you were filming, you now have to give them access to your phone to prove you weren\u2019t?\n\nSomeone could just call the police and say hey, I think that guy was filming me.

Do you go to court to decide what\u2019s \u201creasonable\u201d filming? \n\nMy point is making public filming illegal without very specific definitions of what you\u2019re trying to legislate (or at all even) is a stupid fucking idea that goes against the first amendment.",

Besides the lack of respect for others' space that filming in \"public\" is starting to take on, I think people need to consider that we now have a populace that is surveilling itself for the police. Now with \"AI\" tools looking at all that filmed footage uploaded to the cloud and sold to a 3rd party that then sells it to the police? Supposedly that used to be a chief tactic of the old Soviet bloc countries - get the populace to watch and patrol each other and report those \"bad\" people.
