            "Hi! I (F, 140 lbs) have been trying to lose weight for the last few months but only started taking it more seriously this past month. My goal weight is 130 lbs, but I haven't made any progress towards it and feel very frustrated and stuck. I track my calories and try and remain in a deficit of 1500 calories and I also try and walk at least 30-60 minutes per day. I also don't eat necessarily unhealthily, like my diet is pretty well-balanced, I just crave sweets a lot more than I used to and I try to fit them into my deficit. Is there something I'm doing wrong? Or is there something I can do to make more progress?",
            "Can someone help me with converting weight? So I've gone from 126 lb to 125lb. According to Google, 126 is 9 stone, and 125 lb is 8 stone 9 lb. But there's 14 lb in a stone. I feel like Im being really dumb but surely 125 should be 8 stone 13? I'm really bad at maths so sorry if the answer is obvious",
            "Um is it normal to get sick when u go on a diet? Cuz I\u2019ve been eating pretty much different types of salads. And got sick after that like flu like symptoms and shit. Compared to like my old diet which was pretty much just carbs and sugar\ud83e\uddcd\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

            "Calories in versus out\n\nHey, a general question from a person trying to be in a caloric deficite. If I consume 1800 kcal and my total burnt (Apple Watch tracker) that day is 2100 kcal I will lose weight. If the next day I workout and my total burnt goes up to 2500 kcal, can I eat 2200 kcal and still lose the same amount of weight? Should I long term just eat 1800 kcal regardless of the extra calories burnt that day??? Thanks, I\u2019m just so confused",
            "Calorie burnt trackers are notoriously inaccurate, up to 50%. If you plan on being in a low-ish deficit like 300kcal, I would not eat back any of the extra kcal except for exceptionally high kcal burning days, like a long hike for exemple. I'd just treat it as a help for a little faster weight loss otherwise.",
            "Responding to my own comment: I asked ChatGPT and it told me I should in fact eat more to stay in the same 300 kcal deficite. (Do we agree with ChatGPT?)",
            "Last night I was in a ~600-700lkcal deficite because of working out and strictly eating the limit and I went to bed hungry and had trouble falling asleep.. is that just something to deal with?",
            "No",
            "It depends on how long you've been tracking kcal intake and been at a deficit. If it's still new to you it could only have been that you're not used to eating less yet. It could also have been that you've been eating the right amount but using the wrong foods. 1700 kcal of potato will be way more filling than 1700 kcal of pizza for exemple. It's hard to judge with only one occurence. If you were really hungry, i'd advise you to get something filling but low kcal, like an apple, some cucumber or broccoli. It really helps with feeling full."

I\u2019ve been wanting to lose weight for years but it took me until 2 months ago to buy a scale, download a calorie tracker and to actually buckle down and do it. \n\nFor me, I think it was my first year of medical school. We\u2019re always told that obesity is bad for your health by our doctors and public health campaigns, but for me, it took a whole year of being exposed to complications of obesity to actually make the choice to lose for myself. It\u2019s not what I wanted for my life. \n\nBeing exposed to so much information about obesity also made me notice the effects on myself even more. I was getting winded faster, I could barely walk 20 minutes without getting out of breath and stopping. I was always tired and my mood fluctuated wildly. I think after that, I stopped lying to myself and actually started losing properly. ",

The weight is NOT the reason for the knee pain - I have hyperextentia (extra stretchy) which can cause a lot of problems. For me I have acute scoliosis, flat-feet, and a bunch of other issues, including tendonitis in my knees. But, even if the weight isn't causing the pain, it certainly isn't helping!

She had a knee replacement surgery a few years ago and had a LOT of complications due to her weight and health issues, eventually causing her bone to get infected. They took out the knee replacement, put in a spacer until the infection cleared, then attempted it again. The same thing happened. So they took it out again and told her that they would not repeat the surgery a second time. They gave her the option to keep the spacer in her knee and essentially no longer have a knee and need a walker or wheelchair to get around, or to amputate the leg.\n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019m over here with two perfectly good legs that work just fine, and I was wasting it.

I couldn\u2019t keep up with my dog anymore, hiking was painful. I like reading medical books so I have some head knowledge on obesity and what it does. I gained 40 lbs last year, possibly more, January came and I decided I had enough pain and mood swings and started losing.",

It\u2019s so unhealthy and I can\u2019t imagine creating a culture in my home where family sized bags of takis for lunch is a good idea. Also, I watch those kids exercise at PE and it makes me so sad. I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m the fat parent with the fat kid. \n\nSecond, I was treated so harshly by my family growing up because I was fatter than them. My family is all naturally very skinny. I always got compared to cousins growing up. My family would make fun of me for my lack of athleticism because I was a bit clumsy. I would beg to sign up for sports teams because it looked like fun and my cousins would do it, but they would joke that it\u2019s a waster of time because I\u2019d be so bad at it. I look back at photos of myself and I was not fat. I was barely even overweight. I want to create a healthy, positive environment for my daughter. \n\nLast, that kid is a giant ball of energy and she\u2019s not even 2. I worry about not being able to keep up with her when she gets a bit older. \n\nFor myself, I\u2019m in pain all the time. My back hurts, my feet hurt, my knees hurt, etc. I don\u2019t know if weight loss will cure all of that but it will certainly help. Not only because I\u2019d be less weight for my joints to carry around. But also, if the pains persist, I will feel more confident going to the doctors and more confident that their solution won\u2019t be \u201cjust lose some weight\u201d",

I used to love weddings, family gatherings, public outings and getting dressed up and feeling like I look good. My weight gain sucked at least 50% of the enjoyment out of all occasions - including all of my wedding events, and even my wedding. I got tired of feeling trapped in a body that made my feel like I wasn't even myself anymore. So now I'm changing it, and even though I'm only halfway to my first goal weight, I already feel like I've gotten a bit of my old self back.",

Run for 2 minutes and walk for 4 minutes.

A year later ,100lbs lost and just finished my first half marathon. My motivation was the runner high. I just want to run faster. Running felt so good to me that sometimes I\u2019ll try to run on injury (please dont do it) Yeah I love running. 50 more lbs to reach my GW.",

I also really just want to look and feel my best. I used to hate how I looked but looking back, I was so beautiful. I want to feel like that girl again.

This last (and hopefully final) round was due to my boss informing me that I needed to travel for work to a conference in about two months. I was about 25 pounds heavier than when I last fit in to my nice business casual clothes (I work remote) and I was pretty broke so replacing my wardrobe for an entire week of sessions with vendors and partners was out of the question. My only real option was to drop 25 pounds which I did accomplish in those two months leading up to the conference. In doing so, I felt really good and had established a routine, so when I got back I kept going with it. I lost another 25 pounds over the next two months, 50 pounds total, I am at my goal weight and have managed to stay here for the last 6 months with no plans of ever gaining it back. The downside: I eventually did have to replace my entire wardrobe, as even the clothes I was trying to fit into had quickly become way too large for me. I went from a size 36 waist (tight-fitting) to a comfortable 31, and XL shirts to Medium.",

I just started running a few weeks ago, but do it 4 times a week now and only a mile at a time \ud83d\ude05 but today I ran 2!! Did it take 37 minutes? Yes and did I take 2 short walking breaks? HELL YEAH I did and I'm still so proud. I don't know how attach a photo here since we can't do attachments, but 50 pounds down I can finally see the change in my comparison photos I did today! I feel like I was annoying everyone at work talking about it, so I shut up and I gotta post here.\n\nThis group has helped me so much, I haven't felt alone once in this, once I found it here \ud83d\ude0a Everyone keep working at it, if I can do it you can!! Find an exercise you enjoy even a little bit, I promise you'll find something and weight flies off, at my size either way \ud83d\ude05. Also bonus you can eat a little more",

It's really difficult because I just cannot fall asleep if I don't have something to eat before bed and I will literally just lay there miserable.",

            "I just plan for some calories as a late night snack. I typically only have a small snack at lunchtime, or skip lunch, depending on how I feel. And I plan to save around 200 for a little something before bed. I try to focus on protein, but sometimes it will just be some toast. Dinner is also my biggest meal of the day by far.",
            "Don\u2019t torture yourself. It\u2019s not sustainable. Just factor a late night snack into your calorie budget.",
            "Eat something very low or zero calorie. If you're hungry eat. Watermelon, cucumber, peppers are all very low in calories and will not \"break the bank\" as a snack.",
            "Liquids fill me up. Between dinner and bedtime, I often have a cup of tea or coffee. Or you could try a carbonated water with flavoring. The caffeine doesn't affect my sleep, but if it would for you, use decaf.",
            ">Make dinner my biggest meal instead of lunch?\n\nThis for sure\n\n>Don't eat anything between lunch and dinner and take those foods and move them to before bed instead?\n\nI tried this and it worked for a while, as well as IF, but then I started to get too hungry during the day and that caused me to either overeat anyway at night because I was so hungry at that point, or to just cave in and eat too much in the middle of the afternoon and therefore back to the original problem at night.\n\nWhat worked for me was popcorns and a Ninja Creami lol. My sweet spot is to leave 200kcal for after dinner. 200kcal of popcorns are a satisfying amount for a savory snack. And 200kcal of protein ice cream made with that machine is a super satisfying amount for a sweet snack.",
            "I drink coffee. I know some people can\u2019t have caffeine, but I have no problem going to sleep right after and it cuts back the hunger a bit. Have you tried just drinking water or tea before bed? Often just having something in your stomach, even liquid, helps",
            "Oh I\u2019m the same!\n\nPartly it\u2019s habit. Your body is just USED to getting the sleep time snack so something feels off if you don\u2019t get it. \n\nBut the time at which you eat doesn\u2019t inherently change the basic calories in calories out equation. You can eat whatever you want before you fall asleep. \n\nTrack how many calories your sleep time snack is. Either adjust your meal times so that one of your meals / snacks is the sleep time snack so you have an overall calorie deficit. Or lower the calories of your sleep time snack so that you have an overall calorie deficit.",
            "I (m, 190cm, current BMI 28, goal BMi 25), do it like this (Budget around 2200kcal): \n\nNo breakfast or snacks before noon\n\nSmall lunch (500-800 kcal) around noon (11:30-12:30)\n\nRest of Budget for dinner / snacks between 6 and 8pm\n\nOn my first IF try, I waited till 2pm and I started fantasizing about food like crazy and went overboard at the cafeteria\n\nIt works much better for me like this \n\n\nAlthough I heard there is considerable differences in what might work better for males/females in terms of IF, especially when it comes to breakfast. Maybe you might wanna research some of that.\n\nFor me it's just so much easier to be hungry when working than to be hungry at home",
            "How much do you need? Because you can just put a bit of your dinner in the fridge and eat it right before bed. Those calories are then already budgeted and you can keep your bedtime snack.",
            "Grew up having sleep for dinner a lot.",
            "I\u2019ve been doing something similar to what you\u2019re suggesting for almost a year now. I skip lunch because I noticed that eating a small meal for lunch would cause me to get hungrier. I usually have a breakfast of \\~700kcal at 6AM, a dinner of \\~1000kcal at 7PM and a last meal before going to bed of \\~400kcal.\n\n\rMy dinners are always very dynamic, but for the other two meals I like to incorporate slow digestion, high quality proteins and carbs such as casein protein powder and oats. It has been working well for me, nowadays my weight loss rate is not high but my body is definitely changing as I\u2019ve been keeping track of my body measurements.",
            "Same problem. It's actually getting a bit better with weight loss, but I factor in a hot milky drink (like a half milk/half water low sugar chocolatey drink) or a couple of spoons of Greek yogurt.",
            "I\u2019d keep the bulk of your calories during the day when you\u2019re more active, it\u2019s better for digestion and your sleep cycle, but have a solid snack before bed and plan for those calories. Something fulfilling and satisfying but healthyish? \n\nYou could do yogurt and fruit, apples and peanut butter, protein milk shake, chocolate hummus, fruit and cottage cheese, grapes and cheese etc. I\u2019ve been told if you want sweet just make sure to pair it with a protein.",
            "All about routine.\n\nI eat dinner at 5 and about 150 cal snack around 830, then I floss brush mouthwash which signified the end of food:eating for the day",
            "I reserve a couple hundred calories for later in the night. Greek yogurt and frozen fruit. Anabolic ice cream. String cheese. An apple. Stuff like that.",
            "Cup of caffeine free tea before bed!",
            "Just have the snack. If you try to restrict yourself you\u2019re more likely to fixate on it and end up standing in front of your fridge at 2am eating shredded cheese by the handful. \n\nMy husband and I always have a bedtime snack. Usually an outshine popsicle or the 40 calorie fudgesicles. Hell, sometimes if it fits my calorie budget I do a packet of maple brown sugar oatmeal.",
            "Eating within 2 hours before you sleep is very bad for your digestion. Eat enough at dinner so you\u2019re not hungry before bed."
