            "Greatsword, velk sets. Strategy is just kept baiting for his cone breathe attack and give it to him good lol. And learn and practice timing on which attack u can capitalize. There are still many opening that gs can do on him just that i kept doing it wrong. Watch video on youtube and see how normal solo game with your fav weapon on him will do you well.",
            "You can bait it into doing the cone attack? I honestly don't know much about the inner mechanics of the game. I might be MR999 with 4k hours played, but have beaten Fatalis a total of 30 times. Enough to make all the gear and then just to help other people.",

            "I was literally getting pounded so bad on Longsword, my main weapon, that I switched just to deal with Zino. This worked",
            "Yeah lance seems to be a pretty bad choice for most of the endgame bosses, fatty, alat, monke, etc... Kinda sad. :(  but for the rest it feels amazing to just tank everything. Lol",
            "Lance is actually challenging, but also the most rewarding weapon to use agains Rajang. I really had to watch a pro lancer fight Rajang for tips. Before I was using the \"evade lance\" build, but realized that you lose out on dmg for evading. Its still super fun to fight him, the only major move that you have to watch out for is his grab.",
            "Lance is actually great against Fata. Evade Lancing against Alatreon is super fun even though its nerfed in MHW.",
            "i main lance and not gonna lie the only boss i think the weapon isnt good against is fatty. i love the ala and monkey lance matchups, it almost feels like the weapon was made to deal with them. vs fatty if you get pushed too far away from it or it does the slither away itll kill you with chip damage from fireball spam across the stage.",
            "That's what made me retry many times since I got used to timing the counter instead of Iframe dodges.",
            "I suppose i could understand fatty, bu what about alat's element threshold?",
            "you can check out my build, i posted it on my page. Im using Kjarr weapon so in tottal i have - 920 ice dmg. When my weapon is unsheathed my total Ice dmg is - 1000 its more than enough to get a couple of  elemental topple on Alatreon in between his nova.",
            "You dont even need to bother with element if you are okay carting once in a solo hunt.",
            "I can confirm, I used to do a lot of elemental lance vs alatreon. It's fun using backwards guard during the lightning, frost breath, and fire rings. Lots of hidden movement."

Not immediately, but once you get your good jewels and learn to abuse your ailments, and rocks (even flash pods can help), you're set, you can do the quest in 7 minutes or less. My best was 3-4 minutes after experimenting with which setup would be best. \n\nIf you have distance on them while they're charging, they won't hit you because their charge range has a limit and while they have general tracking with their charge, you can strafe them, unless you're a little too close. I'd maintain a healthy distance and wait until they charge to throw a rock, just to be safe.",

Came back after Rise and sank a bunch of time into Sword and Shield. Then said \"screw it\" on my 2nd playthrough (now on PC) and picked up HH. It honestly feels like crack cocaine. Now that I understand the monsters much better, I can focus on the gameplay loop of HH and it's amazing. Buffing with songs before a fight, dooting with other songs while the monster's down, spinning my horn in its face, saying \"Fuck you\" to Kushala's and Lunastra's Wind Pressure with \"All Wind Pressure Negated\"... I love this game. ",
