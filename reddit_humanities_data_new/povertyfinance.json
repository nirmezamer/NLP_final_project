        "content": "Four months ago I posted the following message on this subreddit due to an increase of shitty people who have not read the rules or the community guidelines:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/11vwilh/special\\_enforcement\\_period/](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/11vwilh/special_enforcement_period/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings have not improved significantly.  As such, these policies are no longer temporary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here is how it is going to be.  Any infraction can (and most likely will) incur a temp ban.  This is to drive home the point that this shit isn't negotiable.  Duration to be determined by the severity of the infraction, but ranging from 1 to 30 days.\n\nA second offense of the same penalty, or getting numerous offenses across different rules will yield longer temp bans with every infraction.  Users who demonstrate that their offenses are innate or deliberate, rather than accidental or incidental will get a full ban.\n\nParticularly shitty people will get a 365 day ban out the gate.  We believe people can change, but we're going to give them lots of time for it.\n\nOvertly evil people, troll accounts, or bad faith people will be banned outright without warning explanation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs always, all actions can be appealed if you believe they are unfair.  HOWEVER, we expect you to review what you said first, and review the rules as well.  If you think we misinterpreted something, got the wrong guy, or whatever, please appeal on those grounds and we will review it.  If you make a bad-faith appeal, whatever ban you have will be extended.  If you come into modmail asking \"why was I banned\" for an obvious infraction you will get an extension.  And please note that saying \"Other kids were doing it too mom\" is not a valid appeal.  If you think other people need to have action taken on them, report their comments as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are a small team.  We can't see everything posted here.  But we sure as hell see all the reports.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit 1:** Intent matters.  Coming here trying to help and breaking a rule will be viewed very differently than coming here with cruel intentions even if the violation is a soft-ball.  \n\n**Edit 2:** Please understand this is still reddit, an anonymous message board filled with sad, miserable, SMALL people.  We won't be able to prevent shitty people wandering in.  We can see them to the door as quickly as they arrive.  **TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN REPORTING SHITTY COMMENTS.**  That's how we get these bastards, when you point them out to us.  Also, if you see something shitty, report it and move on.  Don't fight with an idiot, because they will lower you to their level, defeat you with experience, and get both of you banned in the process! ",

When we had limited funds in the beginning we didn\u2019t spend extravagantly because we had a plan I when started working in my degrees field and I was make the same amount as my other half but his bonus structure was so much better now he\u2019s  in a very good situation for many reason and he decided to retire early he also decided he wanted to by a new car and would  the pass his current car to me it\u2019s a 22 and he would use my current car as his trade in everyone wins . He can do this new car and pay it off. This isn\u2019t bragging it\u2019s a blessing is all and it\u2019s not mine although I get a 22. That\u2019s paid off. All these things we put thought into although he can do as he please with his money and so can I. We do discuss these things but it\u2019s not about permission. We are at a different tax lever but we couldn\u2019t  just go out and buy a car like we can now,a quick little story once we had our stuff together we went to ford  and he got the car he wanted as they where washing and we waited for them to bring it around he said my first car right off the show room floor( he\u2019s from the country) I said what you\u2019ve had cars before he said yea they were used and I was lucky to find the color I wanted this time I got what I wanted and it\u2019s never been driven by anyone and it\u2019s mine. How many people get to be there with their other half for their first of anything? I was honored to have been part of that moment. I did say ahh you know that wasn\u2019t on the show room floor right ? He said yes I do but it\u2019s still new. And mine. I said yes sir it is congrats",

            "I'm broke and I'm really struggling and I've been struggling but now I'm struggling really bad once again. I agree that a lot of my depression and anxiety comes from not having money. Ironically I'm very hungry but I have lost my appetite due to stress. Which is fine by me because I actually want to lose weight haha even though I'm 110 lb at 5 too but I used to be way skinnier. And that was also when I was really struggling and stressing the past 3 years I have been okay off and on and have had decent jobs but now I've had a plateau again and I am falling on hard times once again and I am not really eating due to stress. I try to and I ended up wasting money on takeout that I couldn't even finish eating because I'm so stressed and depressed about my situation. I do a lot of stupid things where I kick myself in the foot. So many of my problems could be solved if I just had at least 20K sitting in a accessible savings account I would feel a lot better about myself and my future. However there are some other things also that money cannot solve such as my daughter's autism and the negative attitude she has right now as a teenager it's so many things that I don't know how to contend with with money or not. But definitely money helps. It's kind of like Marilyn Monroe said my goodness you wouldn't marry a man for money but it certainly helps doesn't it? It's sort of that concept except with ourselves. Yeah we would still maybe have our other problems, such as depression or anxiety or family conflicts or parental difficulties but having money gives us a leg up and helps us to cope with it better than when we don't have money. And also can lead us to resources that we wouldn't normally have access to. Money leads to a better quality of life it's been proven over and over again. That is why people who grow up in the ghetto and impoverished our last mentally and physically healthy than people who grow up privileged and well off. I don't care what other people say there is no harm in having money and people who have it are definitely better off and more privileged than people who don't",

If you're stressed about making your bills every month, or having to work insane hours to make that happen, you have less of an ability to do things you enjoy. \n\nThat being said, you can be making a lot of money and still be living paycheck to paycheck if you're living outside your means.

I personally think being able to use money as a crutch for everything from childhood creates people who don't know how to manage things where money becomes irrelevant. It sucks being poor don't get me wrong lol, and money would also solve a majority of my problems, but not everyone has a life where money could solve *everything*.

I was in therapy (paid by my health insurance) and even had a four-day stay at a psychiatric facility for suicide risk. My therapist recommended some things to make my life easier, like hiring a cleaning person to catch up on my ex-fiance not cleaning at all, but all his tips cost money I just did not have, so I continued suffering.\n\nSince then, I ripped off a human-sized leech, got a job that covers my bills and allows me to save up a bit (though I'm definitely not rich, I don't own a car and have to live frugally) and a few weeks back, I was finally able to afford my own apartment without roommates. I don't have to keep all the auto-deducting bills in my calendar and check my bank account daily.\n\nAnd honestly, I feel so much better. I got off my antidepressants a few months back because I don't need them anymore. I realized that most of my depression came from worrying about money all the damn time. My blood pressure is better than back then, even though I unfortunately kept my weight (working on that). And I actually see forward to afford a dentist appointment in a few months (only the basics are covered by my health insurance) to fill some cavities.

But it's a lot easier to cope with those problems with money than it is without. Being impoverished or struggling financially only compounds are other problems. It also limits our resources and our coping tools to deal with those problems. That is why so many studies show that children who grow up and ghettos and impoverished end up having way more mental and physical health problems lifelong and long-term than children who grow up well off in privileged. It's not to say that children will grow up well off and privilege never have any problems or any heartache but they definitely have a leg up in advantage in society and in life over kids who do not.

            "Actually I've noticed rich people are more guilty of saying this than poor people. You won't ever catch me as a poor person saying that BS to comfort myself or convince myself otherwise. It's mostly rich people who say it and I really want to just tell them off when they say it because they obviously have no idea what it's like to struggle or if they did then they have long forgotten what that feels like. It's so easy to say this colloquial expression when you're not struggling. Money may not be able to buy happiness itself, but it can buy vacations that can distract you from your problems or relieve you of them, it can buy you therapy, it can buy you access to resources that you wouldn't normally have access to without money. It can buy you a nicer environment to live in in a safer area that is less problems and less crime which will contribute to your overall mental and physical well-being, it can buy you nutritious foods that will help your physical and mental health, it can buy you gym memberships that help you stay in shape and healthy and again affect your quality of life. it can help you give a great life to your kids and make you feel like less of a crappy parent because of it and give your kid access to things that they wouldn't have access to otherwise. It can help your kid drive which then makes you happy and feel less guilty as a parent for other shortcomings. I could go on and on and write a whole novel about how having money gives everyone a leg up no matter what. There was a study done in Denver about homeless people have received basic income. Within 5 months of receiving a thousand a month regularly through basic income about 75% of those homeless people had turned their lives around just from that simple boost. Many of them ended up getting full-time jobs and getting places. All they needed was a leg up to help them get a head start in life. All they needed was a little bit of help. And as soon as they took away that supplemental income a lot of them began to struggle again. My point is that we shouldn't rely on the government for help that's not my point but my point is that when people are given a leg up or an economical boost or something to help them they often thrive and do better in the situation then they would otherwise.

Breaking the addiction-poverty-addiction cycle is also a significant factor. (Obvs it\u2019s not 100%, but your odds are much better). Not having access to mental healthcare due to poverty is a barrier that you don\u2019t have to deal with in addition to the illness itself if you\u2019re well-off. Something that was once an unsolvable circumstance without any resources can now begin to be addressed with the resources you can now pay for. It\u2019s not a cure-all, but it does give you a significant head start to be mentally ill with stable financial status vs without.

Many people are only missing one piece of that\u2026 and it\u2019s the money. Some poor people have what they need to be happy, they\u2019ve found resources in their community, luck has smiled upon them, etc. Some rich people have access to everything they need but don\u2019t want to use it for whatever reason (some of those reasons are valid) so they\u2019re unhappy.

I immediately could tell that when I told her about my financial situation, it seemed as if she lost all interest in me all of a sudden.\n\nI asked her where she works and she told me that she is currently not working and she strongly believes that women should be not working and men should be their providers. Of course, everyone has the right to think what they believe is right, but I just simply mentioned that in this economy, it is currently extremely difficult to be the sole breadwinner, to which she immediately responded that only lazy men think like that.\n\nThe date went relatively ok after that, but this morning I texted her saying that it was cool going out with her yesterday and maybe we should see each other one more time.

I was in a long-term serious 4-year relationship with a boy (calling him a man feels weird because of what I am about to say) who expected me to provide for him after he dropped out of high school and refused to get a job. He said he just wanted to be a househusband and build a family with me. After agonizing years, I worked up the courage to leave him and cut him out of my life. \n\nI don\u2019t hate him anymore. I respect that we had differences and values that didn\u2019t align, but I knew I wanted someone as hardworking and ambitious as I was in their career and academia. Especially in this economy? It is near impossible to live on a singular paycheck, unless you are extremely high-earning or lucky to have family support.\n\nPeople like this will always exist \u2014 Men and women alike.

I'm a woman, make good money on my own, but of course I'd still prefer a partner who also makes good money purely for the sense of security it brings in a world that seems to go through a new crisis every month. BUT I'm not frickin delusional that I shouldn't have to work. A single income supporting a family in this economy? Absolutely not. She wants him for his money and not him, most likely. He could lose his job tomorrow and would she stick around? Doubtful. She's a bum - don't let couch surf in your head.",
