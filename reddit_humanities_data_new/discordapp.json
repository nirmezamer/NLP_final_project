        "content": "Hi all! This is a resource to help prevent users from falling for malicious behavior. Scammers attempt to trick you through trust, like accepting a \"prize\" through a malicious link or by using scare tactics, where they convince you to act immediately because something \"bad\" could happen, so be wary and mindful of your interactions with others. There's helpful information on avoiding scams and what to do if you fall for one below.\n\n### Always report malicious/scamming behavior, as well as anything else that breaks Discord's Terms of Service (*see \"Reporting Malicious Content/Behavior\" below*)\n\n---\n###\"Accidental\" Steam/Discord Report & Impersonation\nA common scam is if a user claims you've been accidentally/falsely reported to Steam or Discord for an infraction or fraud. Don't follow instructions provided by anyone claiming to have accidentally reported your account. The most common things that identify this scam are if someone:\n\n- Says your account has been falsely or accidentally reported\n- Directs you to speak with someone through online chat to resolve an investigation or pending ban\n- Requests your account credentials or directs you to perform specific security-related operations\n- Requests an authentication code sent over email, SMS, or anywhere else\n- Says they represent Discord, Steam/Valve, or any other official entity\n- Says you must complete a purchase of ***any*** kind\n\n**You can find some additional info for Discord-related scams [here](https://discord.com/discord-recruitment-scams) and Steam-related scams [here](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3195-9FFB-BA06-F25B).**\n\n---\n###Free Nitro Scams\nIf you believe you have received a possible scam from a bot or user account, consider if they:\n\n- Are new, unfamiliar, or unverified (in the case of bot accounts) contacting you unprompted.\n- Are not from Discord in the form of an email or [System-tagged account](https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360036118732).\n- Have poor grammar, spelling, or misuse of punctuation/capitalization.\n- Offer things that are \"too good to be true.\"\n\n**Official Discord gifting uses the `discord.gift` & `discord.com` domains and will generate a special embed, as [shown in this image](https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360100559094/Screen_Shot_2021-01-19_at_5.32.44_PM.png) (in-app) or [this image](https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500001750501/Screen_Shot_2021-01-19_at_5.38.00_PM.png) (link). Scams are not possible through the official browser/client pages/menus.**\n\nIf these types of bots are repeatedly sending you messages, you can:\n\n- Use Mutual Servers to determine the server(s) they share with you and disable Direct Messages from server members for those servers.\n- If you cannot find any shared servers, you can disable DMs from all servers under your User Settings\n\n---\n###QR Codes, Fake Games, Programs, & Downloads\nA user may pretend to be your friend or use a friend's compromised account to get you to download something. Consider if they want you to:\n\n- Scan a QR code\n- Check out a video\n- Test a game they made\n- Practice running code they wrote\n\nThese are common forms of malicious behavior. If a user asks you to scan/download something or click an unknown link, this could give away your login information and/or allow a malicious program to enter your computer, which can also compromise your account.\n\n---\n###Compromised Accounts\nIf your account sends these kinds of messages, your account has been compromised. If you...\n\n- ...downloaded and executed malware: You should try and use a different device entirely to change your password (e.g., your phone). You should then [follow these steps](https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/115004307527--Windows-Corrupt-Installation) to completely uninstall Discord, run a complete anti-virus scan, and then re-install Discord. If your account is compromised again when logging in afterward, you may need to factory reset your computer.\n- ...entered your password into a malicious/fake website: You should change your password. \n- ...something else: You should change your password.\n\n---\n###Reporting Malicious Content/Behavior\nThere are several methods to report behavior you believe is a scam/malicious.\n\n- Use the integrated \"Report Spam\" button, as [shown in this image](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f9072399b2640f14d6a2bf4/61fb18b9858fe1dcb545ec01_5nSurukZcGFFFZd2fy7rNC93Da3CPtpvG0cNEJfEKzKyvHPWxqlGWpjXA1I6PcNelWtTLho4cU6i7T2WAfiCMJ05YgKY5f5-OgowIeoPt2u3hXoWYndHzxRGayEIcBydlNSKK1lN.png).\n- You can learn how to properly report content by checking out [this article](https://dis.gd/howtoreport).\n\n---\n###More Helpful Resources\n\n- [Scams and What to Look Out For](https://discord.com/blog/common-scams-what-to-look-out-for)\n- [Protecting Against Scams on Discord](https://discord.com/blog/protecting-users-from-scams-on-discord)\n- [Claiming a Nitro Gift FAQ](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500001829622-Claiming-a-Nitro-Gift-FAQ)\n\n---\n###Discord Account Support\nThis subreddit is not the most appropriate location to ask for/receive support for account-related issues. These issues include:\n\n- Login\n- Payment\n- Phone verification\n- Email\n\n**This subreddit is operated by a group of volunteers who do not work for Discord,** and the community is incapable of solving these kinds of issues, so the best way to seek help regarding an account-related issue/request is to:\n\n- Search [the Discord support knowledge base](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us).\n- Submit a ticket to the [Discord's support team](https://dis.gd/contact). They are more knowledgeable, trained, and equipped to help you with any question or issue you might have.\n\n**If you've already submitted a ticket, please be patient and wait for an answer. The support team will get back to you as soon as possible.**",

We encourage you all to continue to make posts on the subreddit proper discussing our product and feature launches. I want to make sure that we really keep this thread productive and focused on reporting bugs and helping us prioritize them.\n\nPlease look through the list of comments and upvote bug reports which you think we should prioritize fixing. Comment as a reply to those top level comments with any more details that can assist our team in prioritizing and fixing the bug. For example, if you have additional info or steps to reproduce, please post a reply, this will help us fix these bugs even faster. If there is no post that discusses the bug you\u2019re encountering, then start a new post in the thread to report the bug to us!\n\n**Reporting a Bug**\n\n1. The most valuable thing you can provide in a bug report is steps. If you\u2019re able to provide steps to reproduce a high priority issue, it will dramatically improve turnaround time on a fix.\n2. Screenshots or videos are also useful, especially if you can\u2019t reliably reproduce it. We highly recommend editing them to not doxx yourself. Not only does it help contextualize the issue, but watching it occur can sometimes provide information that helps us identify and fix it.\n\n**Example Bug Report**\n\n- **Feature**: Keybinds.\n- **Reproduction Rate**: 1 to 10 - This is a score of how easy/consistently the bug reproduces, from 1 meaning \u201cvery hard to reproduce\u201d to 10 meaning \u201ci can consistently make this happen\u201d\n- **Annoyance**: 1 to 10 - How annoying is this bug to your daily usage of Discord, from 1 meaning, \u201cnot that annoying\u201d to 10 meaning \u201cthis bug really truly sucks please fix this as soon as possible.\u201d\n- **Device/System Info**: Pixel 7, Android 13\n- **Discord Version Info**: Stable 263796 (739ec78) Host 1.0.9032 x86 (43225) Windows 10 64-Bit (10.0.19045)\n- **Description**: Toggle Mute keybinds are no longer functioning.\n- **Steps to reproduce**:\n1.

Minimize, tab out, or click out of the Discord app\n   2. Wait for a few minutes.?\n   3.

            "* Feature: Voice Chat\n* Reproduction Rate: 100%\n* Annoyance: 10\n* Discord Version Info: stable 300109 (ce7e96b) Host 1.0.9148 x64 (48468) Build Override: N/A Windows 10 64-bit (10.0.19045)\n* Device/System Info (Device Type, OS Version): Desktop, Windows 10\n* Description: Microphone volume is inconsistent, was reported fixed but it has not been. When you're silent for a period of time, Discord turns your gain up tenfold creating deafening loud audio when you begin talking. It's easier to reproduce if there's quiet voices in the background. Under frequent talking, the volume goes annoyingly quiet. Disabling automatic gain control results in the volume being too quiet too. No settings had been changed on our side. Either the mic volume is too loud, or it's too quiet. There is no inbetween, not since before 19th May, where the volume was consistent and not too loud or too quiet.\n* Video / Screenshot:\n* Steps to Reproduce:\n   1. Join voice chat\n   2. Have another person be quiet, perhaps with a quiet video with voices on in the background.\n   3. The background voices would increase in volume, instead of being deemed background noise, even if they started off outside the input sensitivity range.\n   4. Then have them start talking, and their voice would slowly reduce in volume, and potentially to a point where it's quieter than it used to be prior to the issue occurring.\n* Expected Result: Consistent but reasonable volume, not too quiet, not too loud.\n* Actual Result: Either deafening loud microphone audio or annoyingly quiet.",

I believe it has the same behavior as when you are online on pc and you stop getting notifications on your phone, on pc it isnt a problem because you can still check the messages, on ps5 whatever it is since you only have access to voice chat.

I play online games, made some online friends when I was in like high school, but ever since college I only stuck to my real life friends even when I play online games alone like League of Legends.\n\nLately I thought to myself why not make friends online? I enjoy online interactions when I play games so why am I limiting myself. I discovered there are public discord servers so I joined them but I was kinda shocked. Of course I understand a lot of what\u2019s happening like I\u2019m not 50 or something, but the way people talk is just not what I\u2019m used to at all. Everyone is so intense and angry for some reason. Nothing seems to be problem but they\u2019re just angry all the time? I see teenagers literally calling each other \u201cpdfiles\u201d like every other message and they\u2019re about 15-16 themselves. Yeah who cares teenagers being edgy online that\u2019s not the biggest news ever, but why are they using this word specifically that much? It kinda felt weird. Then guys talking about themselves in the most fake way ever in front of girls, describing jobs unrealistically, suddenly fighting out of nowhere like what is even happening. \n\nThen I saw an 18 year-old saying she hates being here but she\u2019s still here anyways. I legit felt bad because I can see how this can affect your mentality over a long time so I dmed her for the first time dming someone to say sometimes it\u2019s good to take a break or ask yourself why you\u2019re doing this in the first place. She replied with \u201comg therapy vibes ty you\u2014\u201d and called me \u201cnice names\u201d which didn\u2019t shock me considering I play League and was called much worse but was still confused why she\u2019d say that to me lol.

I avoid the nsfw stuff as much as I can which reduces the weird dms.....I mainly stick to my music server and a few others and I've made lots of good friends but it's trial and error until you find your people!\nI'm old though and have used it for years.....some bad people on it like anywhere, but you just have to have thick skin and learn to filter it out.",
            "You'll get a lot of weirdos in large public servers. It gets considerably worse in 18+ NSFW servers, but you'll sometimes find some insanely cool people in them that have smaller servers of their own, full of great people to be around with less than 100 members. You can find a few cool people like that in servers that have over 300k members. Very hard to come by the good ones",
            "Servers with adults tightly moderating content (no slurs, disrespect, insults, off topic chats that are enforced, no NSFW channels, etc) tend to be where the more respectful people hang out. Those kind of servers rarely exist within the gaming community for big games, but smaller early access or niche hobby servers have some good vibes in my experience.\n\nThe internet is huge, varied, and basically complete anarchy. Don't hesitate to ditch the crappy forums instantly and search for something else. If it sucks, hit the bricks.",

Eventually I just gave up.",
            "I don't like the big public servers. I am in a few small servers of friends that I have been invited to after meeting people online through games or D&D, where people post pictures and play together while on voice call, and often use the server to ask if anyone wants to play X game with them. \n\nA friend made a bookclub server with a ton of her online friends where we vote for a book of the month, read it and have a discussion about it.\n\nThere're also some smaller and more \"exclusive\" servers for specific interests (like a hobby or piece of media), where you need to post an introduction/fill out a form and be approved before being granted access to the main server space.",

People ARE angry. Everyone is overworked, underpaid, undervalued, under appreciated, exhausted, and hopeless when they look on media and see few taking advantage of everyone else. \n\nPeople act differently in public.

I guess I\u2019ll stick to my own interests at least to have normal interactions. I have irl friends who aren\u2019t even into my interests so ig that\u2019s enough.",
            "I started discord for the same reasons....I have problems in social situations but I found it easier to talk to people online. You can add me as a friend on it if you want...\n\nYou can find new hobbies through speaking with people who have different interests.
