Some people say that tav was detatched from the plot while i think that it's so immersive that i forgot that my Tav wasnt a character from the game. Some people say that Tav is a blank canva while DU is an actual character, and while i agreed before, i looked at some sources and i found out that if you play as the dark urge, it means that the two had an ecounter and dark urge killed Tav before the events of baldurs gate. While if you play as Tav, it means that Tav survived that ecounter. So id like to think that Tav isnt just some random person that doesnt exist in the universe but has a meaning for the plot.

You get dialog options throughout the game that let you speak from a local Baldurian perspective or as an outsider. There is no specific character story for Tav like there I'd for Durge or any of the other origin characters so that you can create your own headcannon story.",

Durge was interesting though, since I played the same character but with the twist of Durge and figuring out who the hell they were before. Tav is kind of a blank slate, which I guess could be boring to some. While Durge has some given depth to them presented in game which is appealing. Either way, I enjoy both; Durge is my go to though since I essentially play them as Durge turning into Tav, wanting to be a normal person and live their life.",

But if you go all in on the roleplay and develop a complex backstory, it\u2019s going to be unsatisfying never exploring or talking about that past. \n\nI still adore my Tav. I even have a mini of her made and I hope one day I\u2019ll get to fully play out her story in a dnd game.

            "Tav is the \"bad\" just that the Dark Urge has more content, and intertwined with the plot more so it feels more like the intended main character.\n\nThe fact you can fully customize both Tav and Durge, also feels like they want you to play Durge more than a Tav character.\n\n\nAs a generally good aligned player, Tav is my general choice since I can save all the tieflings, and. I don't have to worry about failing urge rolls.",
            "I honestly prefer the Tav origin because I like coming up with my own background story and personality for my character.

Tav is perfect for creating own character and giving them life, but I miss some special dynamics they have (specificaly Astariom romance).\n\nEdit: To sum up, each of them has their pros and cons, but none is worse than other. They just have different qualities and it depends on the person what they want.",

They may not be familiar with the silent protagonist trope that is intentionally quiet so as to allow the player to insert themselves or roleplay however they want. \n\nSome games do give the protagonist a voice, so technically not silent, but they don't really have a built-in personality or history. This is how Tav works or the loan survivor in FO4 (to a degree). Your dialog choices are how you create their personality and such.",
