Sometimes they can naturally fit together, like Dnite on a Screens Pult team, but the person building them put them together over their individually good traits and not because they wanted multiple pseudos.\u00a0\n\n\nBax is also banned from Smogon OU ftr.\u00a0",
            "Stall is usable but not super consistent. It's tough to prep for every bit of bullshit SVOU has in one team so there's usually going to be at least one thing that gives any given Stall team a near-autoloss mu, though in the long run this can be evened out by the numerous excellent matchups you get into teams not specifically made to deal with well-played Stall.\n\nPressure Stall is a specific kind of Stall but overall not good nowadays compared to other formes of Stall. Stall teams tend to rely on chip damage or accumulated weak attacks that make the opponent run out of HP usually way before they're truly out of PP. PP stalling specific Pok\u00e9mon (like Ghold and Garg) can be necessary to beat a given team with Stall, but they usually don't aim to PP stall the literal entire team.",

Of the stuff that got added, only Ogerpon-Wellspring can somewhat act as a check. Darkrai outruns and can revenge maybe but doesn't quite oneshot and in return they also lost Zamazenta as a faster revenge killer.\n\nNothing has fundamentally changed for Wake in the slightest since last time it was there, it still rips apart every moderately defensive team if used in conjunction with Zard Y or when employing SubSunny. If you want an argument to unban it your best shot would be to argue the initial qb was unjustified to begin with, because \"powercreep from the new dlcs\" isn't really a thing.",
            "The basics are as follows:   \n+ You have a total EV budget of 510  \n+ The max a single stat can be trained to (in Gen 9) is 252.  \n+ Every 4 points of EV in a stat increases its value by +1. This makes 252/252/4 a popular EV spread. In the game itself, this wont max out your EVs as these values only add up to 508. However the last 2 EVs are inconsequential   \n+ Any vitamin yields 10 of its corresponding EV (eg: Protein gives +10 attack). 26 of any vitamin will max a stat (assuming your pokemon has the budget to still be EV trained).   \n+ Any feather yields 1 of its corresponding EV  \n+ More info here >> [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Effort\\_values](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Effort_values)  \n+ Mew builds here >> [https://www.smogon.com/dex/sv/pokemon/mew/](https://www.smogon.com/dex/sv/pokemon/mew/)",

            "Those are Characteristics. They don't really matter in-game, however they do provide a hint as to what the mon's highest IV is. A lot less relevant in modern gens where you can already easily see IVs on mons though.\n\n[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Characteristic](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Characteristic)",
            "There's three categories of \"special Pok\u00e9mon\": Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, Sub-Legendary Pok\u00e9mon and Mythical Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nSub-Legendary Pok\u00e9mon are things like Zapdos, Entei, Thundurus, Urshifu, Chi-Yu etc. They're designated as legendary in-game, but otherwise treated like normal Pok\u00e9mon in rules because their base stat total isn't much higher than some non-legendary mons (like Garchomp has more BST than Regirock for example). An exception to the base stat rule is Regigigas.\n\n\"Real\" Legendary Pok\u00e9mon are also known as \"cover legends\" or \"box legends\" since they usually appear on boxart. Think Lugia, Groudon, Koraidon, Zekrom, Solgaleo, these kinds of mons. Mewtwo is also one. These mons are usually the 'Restricted' mons and not legal in every VGC format (and if they are, usually only one or two per team) because their BST is usually in the 660-680 range and they're thus notably more powerful than other mons. Note how Necrozma, Calyrex and historically Zygarde are also Legendary/Restricted Pok\u00e9mon despite having \"low\" BST because they have easily accessible formes that do have legendary stats.\n\nMythical Pok\u00e9mon are mostly event-exclusive, think Mew, Jirachi, Darkrai, Pecharunt. While their base stats aren't necessarily busted, they're nonetheless barred from almost all forms of VGC play for accessibility reasons.\n\n  \nParadox Pok\u00e9mon and UBs (tho these aren't in Gen 9) are technically none of these, but sometimes counted as Sub-Legendary Pok\u00e9mon. Either way they're available without restriction usually.",

Tends to run Modest 252 HP / 180 SpA / 76 SpD.",
            "Size is purely aesthetic and does not affect weight for Heat Crash and similar moves.  Flare Blitz will generally be better in all cases for Arcanine though because its much more consistent with its weight.",
            "Depends on its stats and ability. Defensive/support megas don't tend to do well in VGC, but a very strong offensive threat would make for an incredibly potent combination with Incin's current role.",
            "How much experience do you have in the metagame that you're interested in? The usual recommendation for a new player is not to first try building teams, but learn the game and the meta that they play by using sample/rental teams. This means they can more easily identify mistakes rather than have to figure out if mistakes were made during battles or in the team builder, as well as just learning how to pilot a good team. \n\nIf you're already very familiar with the format you're playing and are still stumped, try modifying existing teams. You don't have to be 100% optimal if you just want to have fun with friends or on a ranked ladder, but presumably you enjoy winning more than losing because there's nothing you could do, so it's good to have a good team structure.",

            "I don't have much experience playing against other players at all, because for the longest time while I was interested in Pok\u00e9mon, I simply didn't have access to online play (I'm a minor and only really play the Switch games, and I didn't exactly have the funds to shill out for Nintendo Online, so I had to ask my dad to get it lol). So, I guess if you really want to stretch it, you could say I have experience with VCG, but that's if you count, just... playing against NPC trainers in the main story and being decent at the battle tower. I get that that probably doesn't count as much experience at all in reality, which is why I'm so interested in trying to get into it now that I actually can battle other players. It's also probably worth mentioning that I haven't gotten the latest Pokemon games yet (I'm waiting for my birthday which is coming up in a few months because, yknow, being a minor and having next to no disposable income... yeah).\n\n  \nI'll try looking into sample / rental teams like you suggested, 'cause I think that might help me feel a bit less intimidated by team building than if I was brute forcing my way through making a passable team with no idea what I'm doing lol. I've looked into good movesets for the Pokemon I DO have access to and tend to gravitate to, and that at least has gotten me a bit of an edge in the NPC battles, which is something, right? So I do already have the means to modify teams I already have, which is decent enough I guess, I don't know.\n\nThank you so much for all the advice! It was very helpful in telling me what I should probably focus on in my quest to become okayish at competitive Pok\u00e9mon, and I really appreciate your patience in trying to help a local newbie not flounder about like a Magikarp with Splash.

        "num_comments": 15,
        "comments": [
            "Essentially, the resulting metagame after a Lax ban would require too much clean-up. Zapdos is a candidate people point to that might need a ban afterwards, some say Jynx to follow, then Bliss etc.. This would be sweeping changes to a meta that people have been playing for 20+ years and no one really wants to deal with the headache, since tiering shifts in legacy metas are usually quite slow and historically mired in bureaucracy. This isn't helped by how unpopular gen 2 ou is in general, possibly dragging out this process even longer. \n\nSnorlax wasn't banned the first time because tiers weren't usage based back in the day. Since then, it has shaped the surrounding meta. Some would even argue that while Lax is undoubtedly op, it's not too restricting, because Lax being on every team gives them an automatic check to many threats while also grants them a wallbreaker against most opposing structures, which many considers a positive presence in the tier.",
            "Having mons witg really high usage is not necessarily restricting. As long as they both fit on multiple different teams and can be beaten by multiple different teams. And having very common mons is good for a stable metagame. If hypothically all mons in a Tier were equally viable them noone could reasonably predict any team they might face. The tier would be chaos and matchups would be highly luck dependant.",
            "Let me put it this way. Pre-Gen 7 in Doubles, Lando was everywhere. Was it far too common? Yes. Was it restricting? No. Gen 2 Lax is the same way. Without it, the Gen would collapse into Blissey-mania and Stall hell. Lax is the glue that keeps everything together in both OU and Ubers",
            "Snorlax + 5 is more diverse than Blissey + Golem + Electric + Skarm + Spiker + filler (if you run a stall team that is) \n\nFor offense, they'd need to run some very frail mons together like Champ, Vaporeon, Wak,... That'd just make them completely collapse to Jynx. Or you can run dumb non Spikes stuff like Belly Zard or Quag if you're that desperate. \n\nNot to mention the repercussions of booting Snorlax to Ubers, you'd need to ban at least 5 other mons to make the tier playable.",
            "because it just isn't banned\n\nYou could write paragraphs about how it's actually not that busted, how it keeps the meta together or how having mandatory mons is totes cool actually and not a sign that this mon might be busted to hell and back...\n\nbut really, the reason is back then ppl just banned the box legendaries and some obviously unfun stuff like evasion or the low accuracy OHKO moves and called it a day. Different ban philosophies and all of that",
            "OP yes, restrictive not-so-much. While Snorlax is undoubtedly the most important piece of any Gen2 OU team, it\u2019s not one you can just send out and win the game with on its own. Lax has many viable sets in OU and Ubers, and so has many different ways to counterplay, so how you build and use your Snorlax is a vector of skill expression in its own.\n\nTo use a popular analogy, Gen2 OU is like chess, and Snorlax is like the queen.",
            "i remember watching a video about this, and basically the Gen 2 meta would be way worse if Snorlax wasn't there, as it keeps in check other threaths like Zapdos",
            "Snorlax is overpowered, but in a way that\u2019s healthy to the meta",
            "I think about that too, how that would change the meta?",
            "Honestly, I don\u2019t mind a Pokemon like Snorlax in Gen 2.\n\nIt gives you a Pokemon to build around, simplifying teambuilding without being too difficult to deal with.\n\nSnorlax is good, but it\u2019s not the kind of Pokemon which wins after one turn of setup or that 2-hit KOs anything with choice specs.",
            "There's a lot of reasons as to why, but basically it boils down to \"it's an older, less popular metagame, and the people who play it enjoy having it around.\"\n\n  \n\n\nFor basically everyone who plays Gen 2 OU, a metagame without Lax would be a worse one, so there's no reason to ban it. Older metagames are not really based on usage statistics, so a pokemon being overcentralizing isn't a bannable offense.\n\n  \n\n\nIf it were, you'd see stuff like the Big 3 of Gen I OU being banned (or at least Tauros and Lax), or Ttar banned in Gen 3.",
            "Adding to what other's have said: Snorlax is great but not unbeatable by a full team. Snorlax really suffers from 4MSS so while it can be tuned to beat just about anything, it can never beat everything. This makes scouting a more relevant part of the game and adds another layer of strategy. Hiding Fireblast or whatever to surprise a Skarmory can be funny and satisfying. \n\nSince you *know* your opponent will have a Snorlax on their team, it makes the full building process slightly more predictable at a macro level even if the individual snorlax set is less predictable than most mons. \n\nReally, you can think of Snorlax as 3 different mons entirely given how it plays (curse, rest talk, and hyper offense all play differently). All 3 are incredible, but a team can only have 1, and they both balance against each other and get checked by some but not all of the rest of the top of the tier. \n\nIf you play the TCG, there are cards called Ace-Specs that are incredibly super powerful item cards, but a deck can only play 1 copy of 1 card, so you have to pick. It will pretty much always be the strongest card in your deck, but it gets balanced by the other 59 and your opponent's Ace-Spec.",
            "Snorlax is basically so op that is the lynch pin of the ou meta",
            "Generations before Gen 4 had a different tiering philosophy. If Gen 2 came out today, Snorlax absolutely would be banned, along with a fair few other Pokemon. \n\nAt this point, there is very little point in doing so. Gen 2 is never going to be a very popular metagame, they might as well keep it the way the player base likes it. \n\nI don't really buy the argument that Gen 2 would inevitably devolve into stall without Snorlax. A major change like Snorlax being banned would have so many far-reaching consequences, I think it's difficult to predict with any real accuracy what the netagame would eventually settle into. That being said, I still don't see the benefit in doing it.",
            "I guess a fair Gen IX comparison would be Great Tusk. There was a point when it was on almost half of all OU teams, but it has so many different sets that it can fit on many different team archetypes, aside from the fact that it checks Gholdengo, the main opposition to it spinning, by itself."

Discussion [(1)](https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/national-dex-viability-rankings.3714511/post-9808747)[(2)](https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/national-dex-viability-rankings.3714511/post-9951925) in the VR thread reiterates the same points that Mega-Banette users always make, namely its Base 165 Attack and access to Poltergeist as well as its incredible utility movepool. \n\nNone of this has changed, so why has it now become something on the same level as Mega-CharX, Mega-Gyarados, and Enamorus? Is it due to the lack of ghosts in the format? Apart from itself, the only other ghost type by usage in OU is Ceruledge. The only other ghosts types, Dragapult and Gholdengo, were banned in September and November, respectively, so why has it taken so long for Mega-Banette to rise to C-(February)?",

            "Team USA used it so good success during SPL which meant people had to admit it does have a niche in the tier.\n\nThe issue mega Bennette had in OU was it being OU by usage, not it having a niche at all, it has always had a niche on certain types of offense, but you'd see it on teams that would be better off with a Lop more often than not. I still don't think it deserves OU by usage but it definitely deserves a slot on the VRs like it has.",
            "To be honest, I still think it's complete ass and a nooptrap.\n\nJust use Ceruledge instead.",
            "I mean I don't know natdex but C- is infact dogshit",

Unless you want to specifically build your team around it (why) it's recommended not to use it still. Don't even think it got any relevant tour results since the ones that got it ranked, frankly.\u00a0",
            "\u201cSince\u201d is generous and it was largely out of respect for some good players who got some success with it during SPL but it\u2019s since just been a flop and as time has gone by, it\u2019s only revealed more why it\u2019s just bad.\n\nTo start, it has awful 4MSS which makes it have nasty flaws no matter what moves it runs. It should be able to act as a Mon that can disrupt opposing offense but actually thuds badly into offense because those pack booster energy users which blank Poltergeist, as well as numerous dark types that eat its hits well. Even Pok\u00e9mon like Ursaluna sees use on screens teams and some specific offense in addition to its place on BO teams and Banette gives that beast endless free turns.\u00a0\n\nHow about other playstyles? Well Stall sits on it forever with Blissey alone, and Dondozo often is able to handle it well while Corv can drain its meager 8PP. Balance has Garg which is an obvious as to why that\u2019s an issue, but also tend to have defensive cores Banette can never get past. Mega Lopunny is often seen on these teams too, and the many Dark types of the tier also give it grief.\n\nSpeaking of that, MBanette fails harder because it can\u2019t even cripple its Dark checks like Dragapult could or Darkrai can. Because Prankster is blocked by them meaning they get free entry on it. Mega Tyranitar gets free rocks or a chance to DD, or threaten a Pursuit. Ting-Lu does not give a care and gets free spikes or clicks ruination on random switch ins.\u00a0\n\nWorst of all is that it\u2019s a Mega which means it takes away that use when there are far better Megas for any role you\u2019d want it to fill. There are better ghost types and there are better disruptive Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nIt\u2019s bad, it\u2019s not worth using and if ladder has any sense of reason (lol) they\u2019ll finally let it die and return to RU where it might fit in (I say hopefully because it was UU before OU and was equally terrible there).",

Sure, but it\u2019s minuscule, way overrepresented on ladder, and a good amount of Natdex players disagree with it being ranked at all.",

I concede that Viability ceiling is a really surface level argument, but I think the in depth arguments held up pretty well despite the downvotes. It still is Over used for sure, and there are certainly much better mega slots but it can work if you use its unique prankster moveset and Attack as an offensive Utility rather than the ACTUAL Noob trap set: Crappy Ceruledge SD + Shadow Sneak clones.\n\nEdit: Found the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stunfisk/s/bRITNIHAX3)",
