            "*In case this story gets deleted/removed:*\n\n**My (33M) desperate wife (30F) ruined our marriage for her flimsy career and did so in a shameless manner. How do I move forward after her disgusting behaviour? **\n\n\nMy wife (30F) is an indie film actor. Please stop reading this post if you\u2019re not open to the concept of ethnocentrism and the strong presence of family structures and values, because I\u2019m not from the West. \n\nI always knew that sometimes my wife\u2019s craft involves kissing/sex scenes. And although this caused issues with both me and my parents, I have worked on my insecurities and dissociation of her work with our relationship and now am a place where I am more tolerant. Although, there was one rule we both agreed on - she will do a good faith evaluation of the script with the director to see if any unnecessary intimate scenes can be eliminated, that is, any intimate scene in the script must be required by the plot from director\u2019s point of view. \n\nMy parents are still not very happy about my wife\u2019s profession but I try to support her and not let them criticise her. \n\nWe\u2019ve recently become parents to a 3 year old toddler and my wife took a break from acting. She decided several months ago that she wants to start working again and I support her. She got back in shape, networked with one of her friends in the industry and got a project after putting in so much effort. \n\nThere was a very erotic scene in this movie and although it made me uncomfortable and a little quiet at the premiere party, I was mentally prepared enough to handle it. But it still took me aback a little because it had been a long time. At the premiere party, several people wanted to talk to her and she is in talks with some over a new project and I\u2019m super proud of the progress she\u2019s made. \n\n\nI heard from the grapevine that the one of the co-leads of the movie (my wife) had requested the director to add the infamous erotic scene, as it would put the spotlight on her. No wonder why my wife was approached by many people. She wanted this. She breached a boundary we made several years ago. \n\nI was fuming and asked my wife if she was the one to do that. She went pale and meekly said yes. Her eyes were teary at that point and she looked like a pathetic wounded animal begging me to comfort her. I obviously withdrew from her and stopped even looking at her. \n\nEvery time I see her now, I see betrayal. I tell her she cheated on me, and now she\u2019s all angry, saying that\u2019s a part of the job. I don\u2019t even acknowledge her in our home and I even told my parents about this who have iced her out too, and her own parents too, who don\u2019t want to associate with her anymore. I told our friends in anger that she cheated on me with the said actor and they don\u2019t want to speak to her anymore either. She tried to refute this accusation but couldn\u2019t, given how our family treated her. \n\nIt hurts to see so isolated, and she expressed once saying that she was afraid she will lose her window and giving an erotic scene a chance was something she wanted to do and didn\u2019t want me affecting her decision and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t tell me. I asked her \u201coh yea, was putting our relationship on the stake worth it?\u201d \n\nShe couldn\u2019t say anything. \n\nI have no idea what to do now. I loved her too much. I still do. And sometimes I feel awful for how I am treating her.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: My (33M) wife (30F) betrayed our agreement and ruined our marriage for her flimsy acting career by requesting an erotic scene in her latest movie. I'm struggling to move forward after her shameless behavior.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She then got in shape, after childbirth, which was apparently enough of an effort to make OOP proud of her.

His adjectives are so over the top. There\u2019s obvious ESL cues, but with such strongly English word choices that actually makes me think this dude is an aspiring writer married to an actress and pissed off at her potential success. \n\nCompletely guessing, of course.

And this is either fake, or a real abuser trying to frame this in such a way as to imply that it's all her fault because she chose to have more sex scenes than her job required, when he's never been ok with her job or her filming sex scenes at all.

And they usually arent the ones to demand more sex scenes. It just all doesnt ring true as a story.\n\nI can see why many would find it awkward, I'm not sure I'd feel comfortable with a spouse filming sex scenes, even knowing that they arent actual sex or remotely sexy or private, but that's why you don't marry an actor if it's something you're not comfortable with.",

But nothing says it was unnecessary or not valuable to the film- given that he only found out when he was gossiping and watching the film itself didnt make him think the scene was unneeded.\n\nTo be honest, if an insecure partner is watching their partner's sex scenes I'd argue he might think most scenes were unnecessary BECAUSE he was uncomfortable with them - I'm not sure it's on him to decide what is most appropriate for a film given that it's not his field. \n\nIt's just not a realistic or easy to interpret boundary.",

A scene can be acclaimed as spicy and still be very important to the story its trying to tell - whether as a character moment or as a part of the plot itself. There is nothing we know except OOP's wife thought it was valuable to remain included and she was willing to do the scene, so the scene was shot and put in the movie. If the scene puts more attention on her character, then it could very well be adding needed character development as well as plot context. \n\nNone of that is against their agreement. All we know is that OOP insists on a career-suicide agreement like that, and is willing to seek out an interpret rumor *without even the most basic discussion with his wife for her perspective*. \n\nHe is by every account, by very principle, unwilling to be fair or objective and actively prevents us from being able to see whether the scene even *did* break their agreement in the first place.",

He and some of the other actors had to wear mocap suits for some of the scenes, including an intimate one. He said it was hilariously awkward because of how big those suits are and he wasn't sure he was even in the right position for anything.",
            "Precisely.\n\nHe said he understands she may need to do sex scenes for work and supposedly accepted that...  Except he doesn't, because the minute he thinks she made a *career choice* to do a scene he called her a cheating whore.\n\nBut supposedly he sees it as \"cheating\" if she has agency in what scenes she did? It's fine if she's forced to do them but not if she chooses them? That sounds kind of rapey honestly. Who decides when a sex scene us necessary? Why does OP, a man who has no experience of working in film, think HE as the posessive husband of an actress, would be the best judge of what a worthy sex scene is?\n\nI'm not sure I'd be 100% comfortable with an actor partner who filmed sex scenes, but I'd want them to have agency and choose if they think a scene is artistic or useful and how to advance their career rather than turning down all films with intimate scenes.  If he cannot cope with his partner filming sex scenes, and theyve both discussed that she can't turn down all the work with sex scenes (or she doesnt want to) then he shouldn't be with an actor. You dont get to dictate someone's job. You get to talk. \n\nAnd whilst I hate cheating, none of this is cheating because it's not actually sex. Or a relationship.  Or secret. She's pretending in front of a crowd of people, for her job. It's not even sex work.  He isn't jealous of the guy she was filming with, and I don't think his concern here was that she was getting sexual gratification or intimacy outside the relationship (which is what cheating is). He isn't reacting like a partner who got cheated on, he's reacting like a controlling partner.\n\nHus real issue is that she made a choice for her career that he didn't like and now wants to shame and punish her for. Because fundamentally though he says that he's ok with her being an actress and filming sex scenes, he's really not. And he was always going to have an issue if she did it.\n\nIt sounds like a masturbatory incel excuse to slutshame this woman for doing her job, under the flimsy pretence that she broke some agreement to only have \"necessary \" sex scenes where that's impossible to actually define.",
            "There is absolutely no indication that she broke the agreement except the fact that OOP sought out gossip to try and make that the case.\n\nThe agreement - if it ever existed at all, I'm seriously doubtful considering how much of an career suicide move it would be - was that she wouldn't do erotic scenes simply for the sake of eroticism. At no point is it ever suggested that this scene did not have plot or character significance. All we know is that OOP's wife agreed the scene was a good idea for the film and that she was willing to do it, so it remained included.",
            "If he's this unhinged on Reddit, he must be this unhinged IRL. I'm sure she was just saying what he wanted to hear because I'm sure he was an obtuse motherfucker about it when she tried to explain. No way a seasoned actress just let him believe that sex scenes were akin to pornography and had an actual sexual component. It was an unreasonable demand and was costing her career, which he clearly stated but then backpedaled and made it about \"cheating.\"\n\nHonestly though it's probably rage bait and I'm more annoyed with the comments eating it up like pigs with slop.",

If your contract violates the law, it is null and void. It their agreement essentially makes her his possession, it was never valid. Cultures which center around owning and controlling half the population are simply not as valid as others.

That directly goes against the agreement that is being described. Unnecesary scenes are to be taken out unless it's necesary from the POV of the DIRECTOR. This scene was added by the wifes request. It breaks the deal.\n\nI understand OOP is a devil here but atleast be honest about the fact that both him and his wife are in the wrongf to varying extends. You're just being dishonest here.",

I think that is how he sees it and I don't think there's anything wrong with him having this boundary against her being in those scenes unless they were already in the script. Her lying and his reaction are the problem here, not the boundary itself which is completely fair.\n\nWhat she did wasn't cheating but it was lying and decietful and she broke his trust.

I asked what was wrong and my sister told me to ask my son that question. \nIt took me a long time to convince Lucas to tell me the truth, and he finally admitted what was wrong. \n\nAs I understand it, Gabriel was curious about what Lucas was drawing (he had his sketchbooks with him). Lucas let him see his sketchbooks, but told him that Gabriel should handle them carefully. \n\nBut when Lucas was outside, Gabriel (with his mother's permission, as I understand it, and I'm not excusing her for this) decided to check Lucas's things. When Lucas returned to the house, he found his sketchbooks torn up.

I kept it up for *years* and put countless hours of work into them. Years and years of my drawings, ticket stubs, brochures and pamphlets from things that I did. Notes to help me remember stuff. It was a daily thing. I was super proud of them and they were basically my prized possessions. \n\nI intended to keep them my whole life as mementos, and to continue the project until I got so old that I physically couldn\u2019t anymore. It was how I kept track of everything. Like, my life was divided by which volume of it I was working on at the time. \n\nWhen I was twenty, so after nine years of daily work, of saving everything, one of my aunts and her son came over for Christmas. Her son, a *seventeen year old* at the time, got pissed because he didn\u2019t get some gift he wanted. He locked himself in my bedroom. I couldn\u2019t get him to leave, and my aunt screamed at me for trying to make him. \n\nWhile he was in there, he found my art journals. He destroyed every one of them. He tore out pages, cut them up, I swear he fucking *pissed* on some of it because it was damp and smelled rank. Just destroyed them beyond repair. Nine years of work, gone in around an hour and a half of him being locked in my room. \n\nI blew up at him when he finally came out and I saw what he did. I screamed at him, and I\u2019ve rarely yelled at people before. The aunt lost it at me for swearing at him when he\u2019s \u201cjust a kid\u201d (17 years old!!) She got physically violent for what wasn\u2019t the first time, punched me in the face multiple times. (I got a black eye from it.) My grandmother took the side of that aunt and her son, as did multiple other family members. (This part of my family had been having issues for a while) \n\nI was expected to apologize for saying \u201cfucking bastard\u201d and for being immature and ruining the family Christmas. My parents just sat in the kitchen and let the others gang up on me until I gave in and accepted that I was the one at fault. They left after that. \n\nOnce they were gone my parents \u201capologized\u201d to me, and said what the rest of the family did was wrong. But apparently not *so* wrong that they could be bothered to defend me and actually say anything to the others. They said I could just start the project over again once I\u2019d calmed down, but after that I\u2019d lost the motivation. Wouldn\u2019t try to do art again at all for another few years. \n\nFuck the OOP.",

In reality I was expressing a genuine fear, because (surprise) my mother only expressed love conditionally, and when she was angry with me would retract her love and approval, which really fucks with a kid\u2019s development! \n\nNow I\u2019m an adult in therapy learning how to cope with an anxious attachment style \u270c\ufe0f\ud83d\ude17",

            "*In case this story gets deleted/removed:*\n\n**AITA for pointing out he lied and misled me?**\n\nFinn is one of my best friends and I've had feelings for him most of the time I've known him. \n\nBut he has always been with other people until now, so I thought I could shoot my shot. He has been in two relationshipships, both long term, but they broke up recently.\n\nIt's hard for me to tell if he has feelings for me too because he might just love me like a friend.\n\nI did go through a stage where I was sleeping with multiple people and having multiple hookups. I've always had a high sex drive, and casual sex was almost a need. I do regret it because I feel like it put guys off, but I don't really regret the casual sex, if that makes sense.\n\nBut I've asked Finn multiple times if he thinks I'm a bop or ran through and he always says no, of course not.\n\nBut I was telling my best friend that I wanted to ask him out and she told me that Finn doesn't date girls who sleep around a lot, like I do. She said she was trying to help me so I didn't embarrass myself, but I just snapped at her and was super upset.\n\nI went to talk to Finn and I told him about how I feel and he said he didn't return my feelings. I asked if it was because of what my friend said, that he doesn't date people who sleep around.\n\nHe got super uncomfortable and said the reasoning doesn't matter, but I pushed him to tell me and he said \"yes, I have a hard time believing someone could be faithful after doing consecutive hookups for years.\"\n\nIt really bugged me, especially because he lied. I said he was being anti-women and slut shaming. He said he heard women say the same thing about men and call them fuckboys, but those women are slut shamers too? And sleeping around doesn't make you a fuckboy, it's lying about wanting a relationship.\n\nI told him that he was as bad as a fuckboy, anyway, because every time I asked if he thought I was ran through he would say no, but now he's not willing to be with me? So he just lied and let me on. He said you don't call your friends run through or liars. I ended up leaving, upset. AITA? Or is he being an ass?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I couldn\u2019t do it. So it is technically his fault and now he\u2019s holding it against me.\u00a0\n\nso she thinks it\u2019s his fault he\u2019s not into her, so he should just have to date her even though he\u2019s not into her?",
            "\n\nCopied verbatim from Oop's comments:\n\n\n\n*YTA - he doesn\u2019t need a reason to not be interested in you*\n\n>Well, yes, technically true. But that doesn\u2019t change that it\u2019s not right if the reason is fueled by misogyny. I felt like I deserved to know after what my friend said.\n\n\n\n*YTA*\n\n\n\n*It was shitty to keep being his friend when you didn't actually care about him as a friend and just wanted to date him. It kinda makes it seem like you were faking\u00a0friendship just so you could jump if his relationship ended.*\n\n\n\n*And while I don't agree with him that lots of hookups mean someone can't be faithful, there's no suggested he thought it was fine for men to sleep around and not women, so I'm not sure why you thought it was misogynist.*\n\n\n\n*And I'm not sure why you thought he was a hypocrite either. There's a difference between not thinking your friend is whatever misogynist version of used up is popular now because it's a stupid and gross concept, and not wanting to date someone who has different views on relationships to you.*\n\n>It is silly to say I don\u2019t actually care about him, as a person, and just want to date him just because I have feelings. I\u2019d easily still be his friend for life, even if he didn\u2019t have feelings for me. I just wish he had a better reason other than me being a bop. It shouldn\u2019t matter who I\u2019ve slept with in the past. Who cares? If he really cared about me, he wouldn\u2019t let that stop him.\n\n\n>And gay people have multiple hookups and still manage to be friends and be in long term relationships. This is just a boring straight person thing. Everyone should explore what they like. The idea that someone who hooks up a lot can\u2019t be faithful is slut shaming anyway. It\u2019s okay to have different views, but it\u2019s not okay if those different views are shaming people who are into casual sex.\u00a0\n\n\n\n*YTA, he has his preference and you have yours. Easy peasy, no need for insults. Being kind to you about your insecurity about being ran through is not leading you on. Like you said, he was in long-term relationships.*\n\n>He wasn\u2019t in a relationship when I asked him if he thought I was a bop/ran through. I wouldn\u2019t ask him that when he was in a relationship, it might come off weird. But anyway, it definitely gives me mixed signals because him saying that made me think that wasn\u2019t something he cared about. And he never said differently.\n\n\n\n*YTA. He probably was honest what he said those things before. He doesn't care if his friends sleep around. But people have different standards for romantic interests and he seems to want someone who is into long-term relationships more than short-term flings.\u00a0It doesn't even have to be about sex.*\n\n>I would be down for a long term relationship with him, just because I\u2019ve had flings in the past doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not down for a long term relationship.\n\n\n\n*YTA for insulting him.*\n\n\n*People have the right to have different standards for friends and girlfriends. As your friend, he didn\u2019t care about the hookups and all of that; why would he when it had nothing to do with him? As a boyfriend, he would care, and that\u2019s okay; a romantic partner is a more intimate relationship that requires a level of trust beyond friendship because, thanks to STIs, your health is literally in each other\u2019s hands.*\n\n>STI\u2019s isn\u2019t a good reason to have that opinion. We can always get an STD test. It isn\u2019t just a \u201ctrust me\u201d thing, you can take your health in your own hands and get your partner tested.\n\n\n\n*Not wanting to date a woman who has slept with many people isn\u2019t misogyny* \ud83d\ude12 *it\u2019s called preference.*\n\n>It can be a preference rooted in misogyny though?\n\n\n\n*Another good example of what you said are job hoppers. I wouldn't even consider someone for a job if they have haven't spent at least a year at any job.*\n\n>If everyone has that mentality, how are people suppose to get jobs in the first place? Seems silly, but you do you.\u00a0\n\n\n\n*But has he ever seen evidence that you can do long term relationships? Or has he even seen you have a short term exclusive relationship?*\n\n\n\n*People have different things they accept. I know several adults who don't like dating anyone if that person has never had a relationship that lasted at least a year.*\n\n>I haven\u2019t been in a long term relationship because I haven\u2019t found anyone I liked enough and because I liked him so much that it felt weird to be with someone else. I couldn\u2019t do it. So it is technically his fault and now he\u2019s holding it against me.\u00a0\n\n\n\n*I dont want to date a man who has a lot of bodies. Everyones different, its preferences.*\n\n>Imagine caring who your bf fucks before you. Could not be me. Btw men with experience are a 100% better in bed because they actually know how to fuck.
