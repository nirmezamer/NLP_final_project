        "content": "Sul Sul!\n\nWelcome to [](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSims/), the #1 subreddit for The Sims franchise and community. Reddit currently only allows two (2) pinned posts at a time, with the Bi-Weekly Build Challenge reserving a permanent slot, we've created this notice board to serve as a central hub for announcements, updates, useful links, information, and more! We will no longer be creating monthly newsletters and we will be using the Notice Board concept moving forward.\n\nThe Notice Board will be updated regularly, so please check it often in accordance with Rule 1: Read the Notice Board Before Posting. When the Notice Board becomes too old, or significant announcements must be made, we will replace it with a new post.\n\nPlease be sure to consult our Rules & Guidelines, as some rules were recently updated or changed, so make sure you're familiar with them. As a member of this community, it is your responsibility to regularly review the rules and guidelines and ensure your communications are aligned.\n\nAs always, if you have any questions or concerns, [Message the Mods](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/thesims)!\n\n# Discord\n\n* [ Discord Server](https://discord.gg/r-thesims-420218840887197696)\n* [The Sims Official Dumpster Fire Discord Server](https://discord.gg/thesims)\n\nConsider joining us on Discord. We have countless active discussions with over 4,000 members. It's also one of the easiest places to find tech support and help with The Sims.\n\nWe've also provided the link to the official Sims Discord server, if you'd want to join that one for some unholy reason.\n\n# Community Highlights\n\n* We've retired the \"What To Buy\" megathread and have instead created a [Buyer's Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/wiki/buyersguide/) which is linked in the sidebar and at the top of the front page with the other links. With this new Buyer's Guide, we will continue to prohibit posts seeking recommendations on packs and computers/laptops.\n* Sometimes, posts go into a queue to be manually reviewed. If you do not see your post immediately after submitting it, this is why. Please read the automated message you receive and please **DO NOT** message the mods asking where your post is. We will not be responding to these messages.\n* Sometimes posts are automatically removed incorrectly. The AutoModerator is not and never will be perfect. We manually review anything that has been automatically removed. Please **DO NOT** message the mods asking why your post was removed erroneously. We will get to it in the queue when we are able to.\n\n# r/TheSims Rules & Guidelines Highlights\n\n* We have updated our No Piracy rule after internal discussion; instead of outright permanent bans, we will be issuing temporary bans for initial offenses. Permanent bans will be issued for repeat offenders or people blatantly circumventing the rule. Moderators will use their best judgement. There will be no warnings issued for violations of this rule. The rule itself remains unchanged: the discussion of the topic is prohibited and sharing/requesting information on how to find and use pirated content (including website names, links, etc.), is prohibited.\n* \"Abandonware\" is included in this rule. Base game conversions are also included in this rule. Patreon custom content/mods and/or custom content/mods locked behind paywalls are NOT included in this rule; knock yourselves out.\n* Piracy is both illegal and against Reddit's policies, therefore we will follow these regulations to the letter. We are not paid nor sponsored by EA and to be honest, we couldn't care less if you pirate the game(s); just have the good sense not to announce it at every opportunity. There is no prize nor reward for doing it and no one cares, so keep it to yourself.\n* For those who do not understand Rule 10: Help Posts Must Have a Descriptive Title, this rule exists to help other members easily find what they're looking for. If someone comes into r/TheSims searching for an issue that may have already been posted about and resolved, posts titled \"help!!!\" or \"does anyone else have this issue?\" are not useful. Your post title will clearly and concisely explain what the problem is. Readers should be able to understand what issue you're having by the title, without needing to click on your post to read more.\n* Lastly, the rules are posted in the same place as every other community on Reddit. Per Reddit guidelines, it is your responsibility to read the community's rules before engaging. \"I didn't know,\" is not valid in a court of law and is not valid here. The rules are written clearly and concisely. If, for some reason, something is still not understood, use the Message the Mods feature and ask before posting.\n\n# The Sims News & Updates\n\n* The Cozy Bistro Kit and Riviera Retreat Kit were released on May 30, 2024.\n* Effective June 10, 2024, The Sims 4 will no longer launch unless your game is fully up to date. The EA App will update the game automatically, otherwise you will see UPDATE REQUIRED and you will be required to click the download button to download and install the latest update.\n* There is a pop-up in-game notifying everyone of this. Everyone gets the pop-up, even if your game is already updated. Please do not submit posts asking for help about this.\n* There has been a recent update and mods have broken. UPDATE YOUR MODS. Please do not submit posts about broken UI, etc. This happens with EVERY update and you should know this by now. You are responsible for managing your own mods folder.\n* Posts asking \"which mod is causing this?\" or \"what mods are broken?\" will be removed and temporary bans will be issued.\n* Nearly everyone is experiencing a bug resulting in astronomical rent prices. Please do not make any more posts about it. It has been reported on the official EA forums.\n* It has been discovered that several different script mods are causing freezing and lag when editing Residential Rental lot types. If you're experiencing this issue, remove your script mods entirely or use the 50/50 method to narrow down which of your mods is causing the problem. It may be different for everyone.\n\n# The Malware Scare\n\n* Malware was previously found in custom content/mod releases from unauthentic sources. When downloading custom content/mods, pay attention to where you're downloading from and from whom. When in doubt, find the creator's official platform (Tumblr, Twitter, Patreon, etc.) and use download links directly from the creator. In this case, official accounts were hacked. Also consider downloading [ModGuard by TwistedMexi](https://www.patreon.com/posts/98126153).\n* CurseForge and TSR have both confirmed that all files containing malware have been found and removed. New automatic security settings are in effect to scan all mods, looking specifically for malware. All accounts that were hacked have been recovered, secured, and are being closely monitored for suspicious activity. All mods that have been uploaded to CurseForge and TSR have been scanned and verified and no other contaminated mods have been found.\n* Please do not submit posts asking if it is \"safe\" to download custom content/mods. The best protection is common sense.\n\n# [Buyer's Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/wiki/buyersguide/)\n\n* r/TheSims sees the same posts every day asking, \"What pack should I get?\", \"Should I get X or X?\", \"What kind of computer do I need?\", etc. These recommendations can vary depending on what you're planning to do in your game and in reality, it all comes down to what YOU like opposed to what others think you should get. As such, we've created a comprehensive guide that will allow you to make informed decisions based on your gameplay interests, Build Mode and CAS styles, and new features with each pack. We've also put together a recommended hardware specs guide for those inquiring about computers and laptops.\n\nPlease note that this will be updated as new packs are released and as such, any and all posts asking \"What to Buy\" questions will be automatically removed and the OP will be redirected here.\n\n# Bi-Weekly Build Challenge\n\n* **Current Challenge:** See Pinned Post\n* Past Challenges: [https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/?f=flair\\_name%3A%22Build%20Challenge%22](https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/?f=flair_name%3A%22Build%20Challenge%22)\n\n# More Useful Links\n\n* [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/wiki/faqs)\n* [High Quality Screenshots Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/wiki/screenshots)\n\n# Game Broken or Acting Weird?\n\n* Update your mods.",

Please direct any build challenge questions to either of us.\n_ _ _\n# Introduction for Newcomers\n\nEvery two weeks, the challenge will change. We\u2019ll design a different house, community venue, or room interior, based on the provided theme, rules, and restrictions. Some challenges will have a monetary limit, such as under $20k, while others may have no limit and you can spend as many Simoleons as you\u2019d like.\n\nThe challenge is not exclusive to The Sims 4; you may submit an entry using any Sims game, but we recommend The Sims 2 onward for the more in-depth building features. However, you may still submit entries for builds created in the original The Sims game.\n\nIf you would like to check out our past challenges, you can see a comprehensive list by searching [The Sims subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/search?q=bi-weekly+build+challenge&restrict_sr=on) under the Build Challenge flair.\n_ _ _\n# Bi-Weekly Build Challenge | Week 156: Nectar Bar, Bistro, Brasserie\n\nThis challenge is focused on creating a nectar bar, bistro, or brasserie. In the real world, a wine bar is a tavern-like business that sells wine by the glass as well as upscale snack food like charcuterie and tapas. They are often furnished with booths and private seating nooks for an intimate and relaxing atmosphere conducive to socializing.\n\nA bistro is characterized as a cozy neighborhood restaurant that serves simple, robust dishes often inspired by European cuisine. They're usually inexpensive and informal.\n\nA brasserie is similar to a bistro, though typically more formal and expensive. Brasseries frequently have a large selection of beers, as they were originally inns or taverns that brewed their own beer.\n_ _ _\n# Reference Links\n\n[Wine Bar](https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/5cbdefea04fdc245a96725b0/16:9/w_1920,c_limit/Wine-Bar-George_2019_First-Floor-Bar.jpg)\n\n[Bistro](https://www.foodrepublic.com/img/gallery/what-makes-a-restaurant-a-bistro/intro-1693167910.webp)\n\n[Brasserie](https://brasseriethoumieux.fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2022/05/brasserie-festive-paris-8e.jpg)\n_ _ _\n# Build Guidelines\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n* **One** entry per person.  \n* Lot Type: Communal (Bar, Lounge, or Restaurant). \n* Minimum Lot Size: 30x20.\n* **No digital altering of photos (i.e., PhotoShop).**\n* CC is **allowed**.\n\nTo submit a valid entry, you must comment on this post and format your comment as such:\n\n***Your Reddit Username - Title of Submission - Sims Game (i.e., The Sims 4) - Link to photo***\n\nYou may also include your Gallery ID or a direct Gallery link if you\u2019d like, but this is not required.

There's even versions that'll go do the graphicsrules.cfg for you and get rid of the weird box shadows\n\nIt still stands as my all-time fave. There's so much more charm and character in it, feels less soulless and gutted.

That was probably one of my biggest pet peeves with sims 2 and then I\u2019d rarely have my sims go out because of that. Now they get to have more of a social life. It also just has so much character, the wants and fears system is a lot better than what we get with 4.
