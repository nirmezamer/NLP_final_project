            "Hey. I'm a new dm and I'm a bit confused about what Challenge Rating of monsters I should be giving my players. I have a group of 5 at lv6,so could someone advise me on what I should be looking at for a challenging encounter?So far I've just used the campaign book,but I feel they are outleveling the encounters in the book.",
            "How do artificer tools and their proficiencies work exactly? I'm about to introduce my artificer into one of my \\[5e\\] campaigns, and, since I know artificers tend to be harder characters to play, I've been reading up on the traits, and some are proving to be confusing. Any help would be appreciated.\n\n1. When making a check or ability roll that involves tools, when would you not have tool that you're proficient in? I'm thinking about \\*Right Tool for the Job\\*, or having to choose a specific artisan tool set for \\*Tool Proficiency\\* (and in my character build, \\*Artisan's Intuition\\* as well). Since you already have Thieves' Tools and Tinkerer's Tools (and Alchemist's Tools), why would there be a need for any others? Don't those cover every need? If I don't have proficency in Weaver's Tools, for example, can't I just use Tinkerer's Tools instead, and it'd do the same thing?\n2. I am a Mark of Making Human. Do those bonuses stack with the artificer ones? For example, could I use the Artificer's \\*Tool Proficiency\\* (+3), and the Mark of Making's \\*Artisan's Intuition\\* (+d4) to give myself a (+3 +d4) to an alchemy roll?\n\nThank you for your explanations.",

            "How does one effectively fight with great weapon user (greatsword) echo knight in combat? If it's a single creature, im assuming me and the echo just jump the target or do i just send the echo repeatedly at it while hang in the back from afar?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0I know in mutiple enemy engagement i would send the echo to one enemy while i take on another obviously but a single target just had me wondering is all. I already watched videos on the things you can do with the echo and how it functions and i believe i understand it for most part.\u00a0",
            "First read the rules for building encounters in the DMG or Basic Rules, then use an encounter builder like [kobold fight club](https://koboldplus.club/#/encounter-builder) to help you browse options and do the math. Keep in mind that CR is helpful to establishing a benchmark but it should just be the starting point in encounter design, there are lot of factors that it or any other simple to use tool can't account for. There can be a lot of variance between individual PC builds, party composition, and player competence, so once you get a sense of what the rules say is a \"deadly\" fight actually means for how much it challenges your players you're going to be grading them on a curve. The system is also designed with the idea that the PCs are going to be getting into multiple fights in a full adventuring day (the daily XP threshold gives a rough sense of what \"full\" means) with a couple of short rests in between fights, so if you're running fewer fights between long rests then the party is going to be able to hit above their weight class and certain classes are going to be performing better than others.",
            "The CR system is not a perfect science. Ideally, a 4 person party of level x should find a monster of challenge rating x a \"challenging\" encounter. This doesn't take into account any kind of magical items the party may have that they can use to their advantage.\n\nIn practice I've found this is almost never the case especially when you consider action economy. One monster of a challenge rating a few numbers higher against a party of 4 will see the party of 4 win 9 times out of 10 purely because it's 4 turns against 1 turn.  \n\nYou have an extra player which skews things even more in their favour. Bump up the enemy's health, throw in an extra low CR minion or two.\n\nHowever, some monsters like Shadows or Intellect Devourers punch well above their weight for their challenge rating and a single one could wipe your party if the dice gods deem it so. In time, as you get more experience, you'll just naturally learn what will work and what won't.\n\nYou can use Kobold Fight Club or DND Beyond's Encounter Builder to get a decent indication into an encounter's difficulty. Although I've found that even \"Deadly\" encounters can often be steamrolled by the PCs.",
            "Any one of a number of online calculators can help with the official Challenge Rating math crunching.  Kobold Fight Club\u2019s license has  been picked up by Kobold Plus who has added some new options. https://koboldplus.club/#/encounter-builder )\n\nbut remember that despite \u201cusing math\", the CR system is way more of an art than a science. \n* read the descriptions of what each level of difficulty means, dont just go by the name. (ie \u201c **Deadly**. A deadly encounter could be lethal for one or more player characters. Survival often requires good tactics and quick thinking, and the party risks defeat.\u201d)\n* while the CR math attempts to account for the number of beings on each side, the further away from 3-5 on each side you get, the less accurate the maths are, at \u201cexponential\u201d rate. Read up on \u201cthe action economy\u201d \u2013 particularly now that expansions like Tasha\u2019s are making it so that every PC almost universally gets an Action AND a Bonus Action each and every turn, and can often also count on getting a Reaction nearly every round. Most monsters dont have meaningful Bonus Actions or any Reactions other than possible Opportunity attacks.\n\t* **Dont do party vs solo monster** \u2013 while Legendary Actions can help, \u201cthe boss\u201d should always have friends with them. Or you will need to severely hack the standard 5e monster design constraints and statblocks. (tell your party you are doing this so that the increase in challenge comes from the increase in challenge and not from you as DM secretly changing the rules without telling the other players the rules have been changed, because that is just a dick move, not a challenge.)\n* The system is based on the presumption that PCs will be facing 6 to 8 encounters between long rests, with 1 or 2 short rests in between. Unless you are doing a dungeon crawl, that is not how most sessions for most tables actually play out \u2013 at most tables, the \u201clong rest\u201d classes are able to \u201cgo NOVA\u201d every combat, not having to worry about conserving resources, so if you are only going to have a couple of encounters between long rests, you will want them to be in the Hard or Deadly range, if you want combat to be \u201ca challenge\u201d \u2013 but keep in mind sometimes you might just want a change of pace at the table and get some chucking of dice or letting your players feel like curbstomping badasses and so the combat doesnt NEED to be \"challenging\" to be \u201crelevant\u201d.\n* Some of the monsters\u2019 official CR ratings are WAY off (Shadows, I am looking at you), so even if the math part were totally accurate, garbage in garbage out.\n\t*  as a sub point \u2013 creatures that can change the action economy are always a gamble \u2013 if the monster can remove a PC from the action economy (paralyze, banishment,  \u201crun away\u201d fear effects) or bring in more creatures (summon 3 crocodiles, dominate/confuse a player into attacking their party)  - the combats where these types of effects go off effectively will be VERY much harder than  in combats where they don\u2019t\n* not all parties are the same \u2013 a party of a Forge Cleric, Paladin and Barbarian will have very different \u201ceasy successes\u201d and \u201cdifficult challenges\u201d than a party of a Sorcerer, Rogue and Wizard.\n* Magic items the party has will almost certainly boost the party\u2019s capability to handle tougher encounters.(a monster's CR is based in large part on its AC and \"to hit\" - if your players have +1 weapons, they are effectively lowering the monster's AC and if your players have +1 armor, they are effectively lowering the monsters' \"to hit\". If your players are mostly kitted with +1 weapons and +1 armor, you probably should consider monsters one lower than their listed CR. Not to mention all the impact that utility magic items can bring!)\n\nApproaching the problem by tossing out the bad default CR system and replacing it with Trekiros - Game Changer\u2019s complex mathing that is probably more representative from both the player and monster side https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8FNVkFuhXI\n\nand a point based alternative in development from Mike Mearls, the original designer who has taken a mea culpa for the faults of the original 5e CR system. https://www.enworld.org/threads/fixing-challenge-rating.702118/ \n \nalthough a quick in your head approach from Sly Flourish works just as well most of the time if you roughly account for the caveats above: https: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VWofhNMHI",
            "1. \"Tool Proficiency\" isn't really a thing.  You have proficiencies in particular types of tool--Mason's Tool Proficiency doesn't mean you'll have proficiency in Thieves Tools, and vice versa.  Right Tool for the Job allows you to make any tool, but you will have no particular skill in using those tools unless you've chosen to take proficiency in them\n\n2.  With the above caveat--you do not have \"Tool Proficiency,\" you have proficiency in \"thieves\u2019 tools, tinker\u2019s tools, (and) one type of artisan\u2019s tools of your choice (chosen and fixed at character creation)\"--but otherwise, the answer is yes, you can stack proficiency in any tools you have proficiency for with the Mark of Making ability",

            "There's often not much point in both you and the echo being next to the same target, unless you're trying to block them.  The advantage that the echo offers is that you can attack without being open to counter attacks.",
            "What I'm asking for 1, though, is, if you're proficient in Tinkerer's Tools, Thieves' Tools, and Alchemist's Tools (which are all automatically given to artificer alchemists) why bother with any other tool set proficiences? Don't those three cover everything that I would need tools for?",
            "I'm new to Dnd, so sorry for ignorance. What's stack? Also so if it's just a single target, do i send it forth and just do nothing for optimal play on my turn?",
            "No.  There are many tool proficiencies and they all do different things.  Many of them are very niche, and you've covered the most useful one there (Thieves Tools) but there are plenty that have solid uses, like Herbalism Kits, Poisoner's Kits, Forgery and Disguise Kits, etc.  If your DM is willing to apply the Xanthar's Guide to Everything Rules, even some of the niche ones can be surprisingly good--the lowly Cobbler's Tools, for example, can let your party travel an extra two hours a day, among other uses.",
            "Sorry I meant to say attack.  And no you don't do nothing, you attack, through your echo. Remember your echo is not a separate creature, it can do nothing on its own, it just lets YOU attack from its location.",
            "Other than the Cobbler's Tools, though, there's not a way to gain proficiency in the ones you've mentioned.  And I guess I'm still just confused why, using your examples, Alchemist Tools couldn't be used instead of an Herbalism Kit and a Poisoner Kit, and, therefore have the proficiency bonus added.  It's all chemicals, after all.  And other situations like that where it seems like a swap out wouldn't be a stretch.  \n\nI guess I don't get the limitations of the three main tool sets, particularly Tinkerer's which seem like they should be able to apply to anything.",
            "Gotcha gotcha, so optimal co.bat turns for me in single target combat with my allies is to simply just send the (sentinel feated) echo at the enemy from a safe distance and attack through it while i hang in the back.

Sadly my races ability for attack advantage only worls on melee attacks and so does sentinel right?",
            "Tinker's tools are quite limited in what they can do\n\n> A set of tinker's tools is designed to enable you to repair many mundane objects.

Proficiency with the tools also grants you a general knowledge of traps and locks.\n\nOther tool's can do lots of other things, they're not all fantastic but they have a lot of uses not covered by the first three. I've detailed them below but Tabletop Builds has a [detailed guide](https://tabletopbuilds.com/complete-guide-to-tools-in-dnd-5e/#Carpenters_Tools) rating their usefulness \n\n* **Brewer's supplies** can be used to identify poison in alcohol and purify water and make booze\n* **Calligrapher's supplies** can be used to determine forgeries and decipher maps and craft elegant documents, identify a document's author and their state of mind\n* **Carpenter's tools** can be used to build wooden structures, fortify shelters and detect creaky floorboards aiding stealth, find weak points in walls and doors\n* **Cartographer's tools** can be used to make maps aiding with travel, find settlements in unfamiliar geography, and find hidden information in maps\n* **Cobbler's Tools** can be used to make shoes, add hdiden compartments to shoes and make shoes more comfortable allowing longer travelling days and determine the origin of a person by their shoes\n* **Cook's Utensils** let you cook food, makemedicine easier to consume, forage more effectively and improve hit die healing during a short rest as well as spot poisong and impurities in food.\n* **Disguise Kit** lets you disguise yourself and spot others disguising themselves\n* **Forgery Kit** let's you forge documents and detect fakes\n* **Glassblower's Tools** Let you craft glassware, gather more information from glassware, find weakpoints in glass\n* **Herbalism Kit** lets you identify plants and potions\n* **Jeweller's Tools** let you identify gems, identify magic uses of gem encrusted items, modify a gems appearance or identify its history\n* **Leatherworker's Tools** let's you create hides from animal skins, change the appearance of leather items, determine the history of them too\n* **Mason's Tools** allow you to craft and improve stone structures, identify the history of stoen buildings, make it easier to spot traps built into them, determine the best way to demolish them, put holes in them.\n* **Navigator's Tools** help you navigate a course, determine direction, avoid becoming lost, predict where settlements may be\n* **Painter's Supplies** let you create drawings and paintings, gain an understanding of the history, lore and value of art pieces, hide messages within art and fidn them,\n* **Poisoner's kit** lets you craft and harvest poisions, handle dangerous poisons, spot posions, determine their effects\n* **Potter's Tools** let you craft ceramics and earthenware, identify the purpose of same, determine original objects froms shards, work out what they held and find weakpoints in same to destroy them\n* **Smith's Tools** let you craft metal items, repair them, general forge work\n* **Weaver's Tools** let you craft cloth and clothing, understand cloth and clothing and repair and repurpose same.\n* **Woodcarver's Tools** let you create intricate objects from wood including arrows, gives some insight into trees and wooden objects.\n* **Vehicle (Water/Land/Space)** The ability to drive a vehicle is incredibly useful and gives you insight into the workings of them.",
            ">Other than the Cobbler's Tools, though, there's not a way to gain proficiency in the ones you've mentioned.\n\nYou can also pick up extra tool proficiencies from your background and some races.  There's also rules to let you learn one during downtime, and a feat, Skilled (altho I def wouldn't recommend blowing an ASI on that)\n\n>I guess I don't get the limitations of the three main tool sets, particularly Tinkerer's which seem like they should be able to apply to anything.\n\nThey aren't \"main\" tool sets, they just happen to be the ones artificers get automatically.  The Xanthar's rules for Tinkerer's Tools aren't actually particularly broad; they're described as \"designed to enable you to repair many mundane objects. Though you can't manufacture much with tinker's tools, you can mend torn clothes, sharpen a worn sword, and patch a tattered suit of chain mail\" and say that you can \"restore 10 hit points to a damaged object for each hour of work\" provided you have the materials for it.  Alchemist tools also have rules saying that as long as you have the materials, \"as part of a long rest, you can use alchemist's supplies to make one dose of acid, alchemist's fire, antitoxin, oil, perfume, or soap.\"  Useful, but not a catch-all by any means.\n\nOf course, your DM has the final say.  It certainly wouldn't be crazy to let you use Alchemist Tools proficiency to make poisons or even potions, provided they made you spend money/effort getting the ingredients.  But as far as the stock official rules are concerned, there's not a ton of overlap.",
            "I don't know what race you are so I can't say about that,  OAs only work with melee attacks, so sentinel doesn't really have any application for ranged attacks.",
            "Dm allowed me to play the Sahuagin (shark flavored) race it had an advantage on attacks against non full hp people. We toned it down to limited times proficiency usage. So yea, the plan should be to go 5 levels fighter with great weapon master and sentinel using my greatsword and then 2 levels of barbarian for 6 and 7, then after that rest in fighter right? \n\nGameplan is keep sending echo knight from a safe distance to fight single target enemies while I hang in the back and against multiple me and e knight take on two separate enemies correct?",

Preventing them from running away or delaying their movements a turn?\n\nYou seem to be evaluating it without having seen it in play, because I see no other way you would come up with this question.

I disagree about the usefulness of a spell, so I can't have **ever** experienced it. Except I literally ran a combat against someone who used plant growth on me two weeks ago. I know how the spell works, I know how it can effect enemies. What both you, and the op, are ignoring is how I've said that in **reality** combat arenas are not commonly so big that the caster just STARTS over a 100 feet away from the enemy and the rest of their group. \n\nYou absolutely can grow plants on one half of the battlefield, and not on the other half, but it's backbreaking, like you said, for any melee creature and that includes your own party. So your OWN ALLIES who operate in melee can no longer get close to the enemy to do their thing unless you leave open patches, and those open patches for your allies to use can conversely just be used by the enemies as well. So if you put a square of plant growth on an enemy, and then leave an open patch for your melee party members to employ, then plant growth effectively has done nothing. If you leave one extra plant space between allies and enemies, you're right back in the situation where your melee people can't take advantage of the combat.\n\nA variety of monster statblocks have ranged attacks, so now they just stand in place or use their own spells to move around and fight from range. Melee guys are incapacitated, sure, absolutely, but effectively the monsters are shielded now from all melee party members thanks to plant growth.\n\nIn this perfect world where the caster is 100 feet away from the start of a battle, selectively choosing what squares to grow plants in, limiting only enemies and not inconveniencing allies in any way, is **extremely situational**, and any DM that is completely incapacitated by this spell either doesn't know how to design a combat or never meant the combat to be threatening anyway (and that can sometimes be fine too).",

You still shouldn't actually do that in game generally IMO because it's a pain in the ass for bookkeeping purposes for the DM.

So you're adding disproportionately to their adversity. \n\nMake it easier to close the distance, use BG3 jump rules (jump is a bonus action and can increase overall movement by the result of the jump check, and make the jump check equal to the distance horizontal, vertical, and standing so they can barbarian leap on top of a house) and stop adding effects that punish them for closing. There are lots of other cool tactical effects you can use.",
            "\"While the Barbarian and Fighter\" - \"Plant Growth\" - \"Take damage if they move\"\n\nmy initial thought is that maybe you are using a lot of CC, and melee characters suffer the most because of it because they have to spend entire turns not doing anything, while this kind of CC rarely effects ranged characters in the same way.  The difference between range and melee in 5e is absurd already, and you might just be making it worse.",
            "So, while part of tbis is definitely a matter of preference, the clear line drawn here also seems to be that your magic/talent users enjoy these things, and your martial characters hate it.\n\nThis may be because the conditions you're including are disproportionately affecting the martials veruses the rest, which is very common in official 5e design to begin with, but especially when pulling from games with different fundamentals than 5e.\n\nPenalties for moving aren't gonna affect your non maftials at all the same way, especially if your martials are melee.\n\nFurthermore, while you're taking design from pf2e and 4e and such for the monsters, are you also taking the benefits the players had to deal with those things, too? Because if not, there's another clear reason for the pain points \n\nI borrow from 3.xe, 4e, and both pathfinder games, too, but I also refine what I take to fit the scope of 5e and leave it out if I can't. 3.5e required player characters to Christmas tree themselves with save boosting items, or outright immunities against effects, otherwise all it took was a single monster ability to wipe out your character with no way to defend against it for example. It applies to every game you're pulling from.\n\n*\"Stress is created when you are responsible for something you don't have the ability/authority to live up to\"* This is something to keep in mind and pay to design in ttrpgs as well.\n\nIf you're applying conditions that are hindering the effectiveness of certain characters or adding far to many consequences they don't have any real answers too beyond making a save (an extra issue because 5es save system is arguably the worst its been in d&d history.)  And so their gameplay shuts down while others have answers, you're definitely making stress and dissatisfaction for them that isn't entirely unreasonable to be upset about.\n\nLet's take your *\"you can not move if you wanna make a constitution save to avoid further bleeding\"* mechanic. Add *\"you cannot cast/concentrate on a spell/talent or make a range attack\"* to that list of restrictions and see how happy your non-martial players are with it when it starts shutting them down or punishing them more equal to that of the martials.\n\nNow I'm not saying don't steal these mechanics from the editions of the past and rival games, but I am saying consider how you're implementing them and perhaps looking at the source material for the solutions and answers those games have to these issues that you can also bring to your games.",
            "Like others have said, its about melee vs ranged, and martial vs caster. Melee martial is already behind particularly in regards to positioning and having enemies add additional bleeds and stuff isn't adding choice, it's just handing your melee martials a dilema between a shit sandwich or a turd sub. The melee martials are going to disproportionately get hit by this sort of thing and be more affected by it. The wizard cares far less about positioning, and if he does, he can teleport out. \n\n> Does anyone have any advice? The basic problem is boils down to half the players want to just charge in and start swinging\n\nThat's what their class is built to do. It's not about them being simple players, its about game design, and them being pushed to do that. What's the alternative you have presented? Waste their action to do a medicine check while surrounded by enemies, or while the enemy has left their range? The best defence is a good offence, killing the enemy is the best option, and so they never really had a choice, all you've actually done in these examples is given them a DOT or effect that punished moving, which they still need to do.\n\nThat doesn't mean never have those mechanics or introduce choices like that. I am saying be mindful of whether or not it's an actual choice, and who it affects most. The wizard at the back who can just force a save on the enemy doesn't care about disadvantage or not moving much this round most of the time. If the mechanics you were adding were of the 'can't be affected by anything from more than 10 feet away' 'reflects ranged and aoe effects' 'causes spells cast on them to be eaten and if the caster tries to cast another spell from that same school of magic they need to make a wisdom save or suffer damage' you might see a different reaction.",
            "One thing I noticed is the fact that the close ranged characters that basically just hit stuff are frustrated and that the players with more options enjoy the combat? Is it possible, that you shut down the martials too hard?\nMaybe you can ask the players if they feel this is the case? How is the impact of each player? Are they about the same or do the unhappy players really get shut down?\n\n\nI mean, if I get hit by a spell that basically prevents me doing anything, I am unhappy as well.\n\nIf this is right, you should change your encounters in a way that does not counter the Martials as hard and counters the other PC's more.",

            "Maybe give your martials items to help them deal with crowd control? Nothing specific is coming to mind, but I haven't had my coffee yet so brain no worky.  \n\nAlternately, have a 1on1 discussion with one or more of the casters about being a little more focused on enabling the martials rather than directly attacking. I had one campaign where the wizard was bloodthirsty but also a committed pacifist. She would do things like use fireball to blast walls down for the barb to rush through or otherwise alter the terrain in favor of our martials. Saw the paladin ride a force blast as he was doing a shield bash. A little bit of that on the part of the casters makes the entire fight more fun for everyone.",

            "I'm seeing a lot of 'i punish the melee players because I thought combat was too simple' and not a lot of 'i'm making magic harder to land because spell casting is too powerful'.\n\nYou mentioned you added tactical things into your combat, so that the bad guys feel like they got to their powerful position by being smart. that's fine, where's the anti magic armour? you didn't mention at all using anti magic armour. Any world where Flail Snails can be found could have a very lucrative trade in making anti magic armour. Volo's even mentions it. Have a lot of your 'fodder' enemies have shields of spellguard, or heck add spellguard to armour.  That's tactical, and any big bad with gold can easily out fit himself and his goons with it. It's also something that doesn't punish melee combatants. \n\nYou want your combats to be tactical. Well Logistics is a tactic.",
            "While splitting still seems like a good option, you can also divide the group for fights and give them different tasks to handle when fighting. And be specific about that one part is perfect for a fighter/barbarian, and the other is more tactical.\nThat's more to handle for you though, but can also make for some interesting plot interactions, where both fighting parties need to be successful to achieve an overall goal.\n\nSure, each group still needs to deal with the other parties style, but they get to fight the way they want. And after the fight, they get right back together.",
            "So everyone else has already gotten onto the Martial/Caster and Melee/Ranged train, so I'll make one point about that then bring in another possibility. \n\nThere was a post on the PF2 sub a while back about how Spellcasters didn't feel powerful compared to the Fighter, and someone brought up something really interesting: Fighters shine in braindead situations. The more steps there are between \"Bonk the guy\", the worse Fighters get. Spellcasters typically have the tools to deal with situations that aren't \"Bonk the guy\". Getting through impassible terrain, getting out of a lava pit, stopping a warping enemy, etc. 5e is even worse about this, since Martials don't have any tools to respond to complex situations. \n\nNow for the other possibility. It's no secret that compared to spellcasters, Martials don't have a lot of gameplay options. It's also possible that the players who pick Martials are fine with that. They want to turn their brain off a bit, run up and hit stuff. When you make the game more complicated, those players are going to feel it. Your caster players are happy with their diverse choices, and now their choices have way more weight.",
            "Others here are pondered if this could be a side-effect of ranged vs melee or such.\n\nMy answer is going to make the (possibly wrong) assumption that this comes down to different tastes in gameplay between your two groups of players.\n\nYou can have different \"difficulty levels\" for different players. As long as this isn't so extreme that the hard-mode characters would be incentivised to stay out of combat entirely.\n\nOf course, *this is absolutely something you discuss with the whole party first*. They might not like the idea.\n\n**Solution 1:** These \"tactical crap\" abilties have special, toned-down effects for the barbarian and fighter. If you invent Ability X for an NPC, it does effect A for most characters, but lesser effect B for the fighter and barbarian.\n\n**Solution 2:** Give the fighter and barbarian in-game items that protect them from typical \"tactical crap\". Items of *freedom of movement*, items that protect from Stunned and Blinded, that sort of thing. Be clear out-of-character who these things are for, and why.\n\nBoth cases are extra work for you, as DM. But it may be the best you've got, since you don't want to split up the group.",
            "You've got to figure out ways to provide challenges that allow the superior strength and toughness of the martial classes to solve problems that fancypants magic bs doesn't. Introduce mechanics that require object or environment interaction, where their athletics skills and the barbarian's increased movement will benefit them. Anything where strength saves, athletics checks, or just raw durability are a factor. Martials have a lot more options than just weapon attacks but they need an opportunity to use those.\n\nMagic items for the martials might balance things out too! Give them new abilities or resistances through fancy glowing weapons and armour.",
            "The reason that the barbarian and fighter only charge in and swing is because that is all they can do. Look at their character sheets and ask yourself \"If I choose not to run in and attack, what meaningful contribution can I make to the combat?\" Most fighters and barbarians can only contribute via damage and the small amount of buff effects they may have are both subclass dependant and may only be once or twice for the combat.\n\nThe examples of bleed as a choice and the spike growth they got mad at are both effects that hinder melee martials like them far more. Since they need to be in melee to deal good damage, which is the only thing martials really have going for them, anything that messes up movement will harm them more. They will almost never be able to make the save on bleed if they have to chase an enemy and they are probably not good on medicine checks aswell. Spellcasters can cast fly to escape spike growth or teleport which would probably not count as moving for bleed.\n\nYou also use abilities for enemies outside of 5e but you dont mention if your players get any powerful homebrew to counter or work around the enemies abilities. This makes it seem like your martial enemies are just working with more at their disposal.\n\nThe only way I can see these two being able to play on equal level is by adding a lot of homebrew to their abilities.",
            "Stuff like ten damage a turn is actually insane. Especially because it\u2019s not like any characters can resist bleed damage. A level 5 fighter will probably have 60-70 hp so having them take even two turns of ten damage means they are operating with a health pool similar to casters while still expected to frontline like a normal martial.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like you\u2019ve overtuned things past the martials\u2019 toolkits. Simply put. Melee martials like barbarians and fighters just don\u2019t have the same diversity of options as literally any caster or half caster.\n\nYou can give enemies intelligence and strategy without giving them tons of powers.",

            "From reading this, I don't think I'd want to play in that campaign. It sounds like enemies abilities are coming from all kinds of sources, regardless of whether or not they fit with the system you are playing. It also sounds like you are adding abilities to enemies as you see fit, with no prior testing. It's like playing in an alpha build of a frankenstein system.",

I am playing a bear totem Great Weapon Fighter (GWF) right now its a blast.   But I rage reckless attack and power attack almost every time.  I hit for 25-50 points of damage or more every round and take half damage.  \n\nIs the problem that the enemies are battle field control options and use them?   \n\nOr is the problem that the melee dudes don't have options so can't use them?  \n\nTry giving your tanks a cool weapon.  One with an interesting ability not a powerful one.  Misty step sword, javelin of slow.  Boots of spider climb.  Shield of stun, or reflect magic.  Helmet of fear.  \n\nOr find an excuse to give them both 2 ki points and the ability to use them on, patient defense, step of the wind, and flurry of blows.

Its the power fantasy approach, they want a Marvel movie where the heroes succeed in spectacular fashion while the enemies flail about helpless against their superhuman powers. This usually is seen among newer players. The fantasy breaks for them when they are repeatedly hampered or foiled by clever enemies.\n\nThe solution? Get new players! /s While it would allow you to have your cake and eat it to, its not realistic for most groups and there are often other factors, like personal relationships to consider.\n\nHonestly I would dial it back some or encourage the unhappy players to change/remake their PCs to suit the adventure. Unfortunately most tables cannot survive 3 super happy players and 2 unhappy for long. Better to provide an experience all 5 can enjoy, even if its to a lesser degree.",

I incorporate plenty of abilities like cyclones whose effects get worse the further away you are from the center and effects like \"any enemy more than 15' away from you is invisible to you\", since I'm not a fan of the fact that 5e monsters seem to exclusively have effects that punish nearby characters and never the reverse.    \n    \nBut melee is an inherent disadvantage in terms of positioning, and the melee classes themselves have less tools. There doesn't appear to be a ton I can do about those two factors other than suggest homebrew alternatives for the second, since the first is kind of inherent to how geometry works. Tried a few things to see if I could make melee more advantageous - removed the one a round limit on opportunity attacks, buffed opportunity attack damage and made using ranged attacks or casting most spells provoke an opportunity attack.

Fighter and barb struggle, while the most of the caster classes are proficient in the relevant saves or just generally have higher scores in those saves.\n\nResistance or immunity to damage from non-magical attacks?

Gameplay mechanics are an abstraction for events the characters are experiencing, so in the case of the above bleed as soon as it affects you you know that moving will mean you can't save against it that turn and a medicine check will fix it.

            "Actually, I'd say that's one of 5e's strengths. Now if you get hold person'd the rest of the party can free you by hitting the caster, instead of it just being based on how well you rolled your save. Huge improvement in interactivity.\n    \nNot saying it's the first edition to solve it, 4e support characters had plenty of cantrips like shaman's \"deal 1d8+wis mod thunder damage and an ally within 10' of you or your spirit companion can roll a save against an effect on them\", but it's definitely a huge positive.",

The higher a player\u2019s overall scores in the attributes associated with the check, the effect will in turn have a lessened effect on fail.

That's fine, you don't... but that may very well mean that the Fighter and Barbarian may get frustrated and leave the campaign, or continue in a less than enthusiastic way that saps the fun for you or others.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0If you don't want to these outcomes you will need to make changes. The easiest of them is simply *toning down* the rate you use these mechanics. I don't mean using them selectively to not impact those who don't like them, I mean in general. Not everyone fight needs to be against a smart, tactical enemy. Not every enemy is CAPABLE of producing these effects, so why always include them? A fight or two now or then that caters to the Fighter and Barbarian's preferences isn't too much to ask -- and if your other players *complain* then they should, as rational (hopefully) adults, that their party members have *likewise* been in a similar scenario of not liking combat for a good while now.\n\n\n\u00a0Beyond that you may want to honestly re-evaluate how your altered mechanics actually impact classes in 5e -- for instance that bleed mechanic? Is that really a choice? Or does it make the player feel like they HAVE to use their action on the medicine check? 10 damage is pretty severe, it's about 6% of a level 20 characters max hp per round but it can be far more punishing to lower leveled characters -- a fighter with 50 hp would be losing ***20%*** of their hp each turn if they didnt do it.",
            "The smarter enemies, ie the more dangerous ones, go for whatever weak points they can find. The wizard is a mountain dwarf necromancer and not particularly vulnerable, but there have been quite a few times they've been focus fired.   \n     \nI don't tend to go in for high con saves on caster characters - the upside to doing things like importing tanks from last edition is it allows you to make the backlike very vulnerable. Everyone has good defenses is much less interesting for players than some enemies have great defenses and they protect others with poor defenses.",
            "There's also probably a tactical element here too. \n\nWhen you throw up a spike growth, does the wizard cast dispel magic on it or fly on the barbarian or does he say 'sucks to suck' and go back to his DPR macros?"

This allows them to make a weapon attack with a reaction against a creature that hits them. Which will be every turn. **This adds frenzy damage**. With a feature like this, I'd tell the DM I don't even try to dodge if necessary. \n\n\nThis build will be simple. Species doesn't matter. No other feat matters. The Barbarian will use a great sword/greataxe/maul for its weapons, and it will just take the great weapon master feat. In 2024, you can fit way more feats into builds, but we'll just take this one. With the 2024 rules, GWM gives you +1 to strength and adds your proficiency bonus to damage once per turn. You still get the bonus action cleave if you kill something. It no longer does the -5 +10 thing. \n\n\n**At lv 5 with 18 strength**: 4d6 + 12 (weapon attacks with rage bonus) + 2d6 (frenzy) + 3 (gwm) = 36 avg.

Just consistent damage, with no accuracy penalties, **All while knocking people prone, pushing them around 10-30 feet at at a time, leaving into multiple enemies, we're doing automatic damage even if you miss. You have advantage on two out of three of your attacks each turn because you forego advantage once to do brutal strike. \n\n\nI have not factored in pole arm master to get the guaranteed bonus action attack or feats like charger to get an additional 1d8 damage each turn either.

            "I\u2019ve been saying the same thing since seeing the release\u2014I never thought I\u2019d actually *want* to play a berserker. They also get so many more rage uses.\n\nYou\u2019re just mentioning the offense, but they\u2019re also nuts defensive too, especially with the improved dex save advantage, 0HP revive bringing you back to 2x your barb level in health,  and all the utility from brutal strikes. Do a bajillion damage and take a bajillion damage, sounds amazing\u2026honestly might even be better than fighters",
            "Yeah that's true. One of the worst subclasses to one of the best.",
            "I\u2019m glad they did change it, berserker was THE barbarian fantasy class, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s mechanics reflect that now",
            "Wow, I didn't notice Frenzy added per-turn.\n\nThat's actually pretty weird in an edition that _removed_ it from Sneak Attack. huh.",
            "Do we have confirmation that GWM will be a feat in 5.5? I didn't think the list of 70ish were available yet.",
            "If I remember correctly, Frenzy only adds damage when you are recklessly attacking. Which you can only do during your turn, unless they changed that as well.",
            ">Now it adds a number of d6s equal to your rage damage modifier to your attack once per turn (not round). At level 3 that is 2d6, At level 9 that's 3d6, and at level 16 that's 4d6. \n\nRogue: What am I, chopped liver?",
            "\u201cIf all attacks hit\u201d is like assessing spells if creatures never passed their saving throws. Factor in hit averages and you\u2019ll see that whopping 75.5 damage go down a lot.",
            "Good I framing hope so!  When they only thing you do is damage, and you're paying for it with melee range, you had better be able to deal more *of* it than anyone else.   That's always been the fantasy of Barbarian but gameplay has not really delivered on it so far in 5e.",
            "In 5e its like i never even got to use berserker, cuz it was so broken. Most of the new stuff is looking cool, and has me excited for the updates, but this... this is like using it for the first time. And oh, it feels good....",
            "In the UA, frenzy only applied on the first attack of *your* turn. In the preview doc on DND beyond, the author has said \"each turn\", but they are not being super careful with their language here, so it's not clear if they mean \"each turn \\[of yours\\]\", or not. Interested in where they have landed in the actual PHB.",
            "Now add a three level dip for Champion Fighters and you've effectively got the next character I *really* want to play lol\n\nIs it basic as fuck? Yes. Will it be beyond fun to just maul everything in my way?? **HELL YEAH!!**",
            "What is new GWM again? Does it still have the Bonus Action attack?",
            "Pretty sure the frenzy bonus damage only activates on YOUR turn, so not on reaction attacks (at least in the playtest). Still a strong subclass.",
            "It's a major improvement, but I would be surprised if it outdamaged a 5e Arcane Trickster with some kind of opportunity attack enhancing feat for example, especially considering differences in Stealth, Iniative, Perception, Range etc",
            "There's something I love about the old great weapon Masters feat. That was push your luck. It was just fun to do",
            "Power. Creep.",
            "oh no, a martial at lvl 10 doing something relevant, what will we do...",
            "guy wit money?",
            "they reverted the sneak attack change.",
            "It makes a kind of sense. Trying to fish for sneak attacks out of your turn was always cheese to make up for the fact that the designers didn't give rogue enough love in combat design.\n\n\nKeeping it on a subclass that gets a counterattack as part of their kit is just obvious synergy.",
            "It was present throughout the entire UA removing it now would be unforseen but technically no",
            "It definitely will be but without the power attack feature.",
            "Reckless applies until the start of your next turn so it would still count",
            "If they keep the UA, using reckless attack caused every attack, even on other turns, to be with advantage until your next turn.",
            "With reckless attack, you'll be pretty accurate. Having just finished running for a barbarian in a level 1-12 campaign, he rarely ever missed.",
            "This is the most excited I\u2019ve ever been to play a critfishing pure martial. It just sounds like so much fun compared to 5E\u2019s version.",
            "It keeps the Bonus Action attack and swaps out the power attack feature for a +1 to strength and this:\n\n> When you hit a creature with a Heavy Melee Weapon as part of the Attack Action on your turn, you can cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target. The extra damage equals your Proficiency Bonus, and you can deal it only once per turn.",
            "Meanwhile Paladins getting delivered. Lmfao\n\nWith these levels of buffs that Barb and Fighter got, honestly they're on 2014 Paladins level.",
            "Really! huh, shows how well I've kept up!\n\nI guess they're not being so draconian about damage \"spikes\" in general anymore.",
            "In a UA. It wont be completely clear until Monday which version they kept. I would bet its still once a turn, but no definite confirmation yet as far as I am aware.",
            "Apparently they walked back the sneak attack limitation, so I don't even know _what_ to think anymore, lol.",
            "From an optimizer\u2019s perspective, I always found that kind of cheese fun. There weren\u2019t a lot of ways to do it, and the benefits were great but not game-busting. I love niche interactions like that. It\u2019s why Swashbuckler is one of my favorite classes, since they can pull it off easily and everything about Panache.",
            "^That is one of the new changes. For some reason they didn't discuss it in the video. Now when you reckless attack, you are reckless attacking for the entire round.",
            "Except Paladins who are stuck to one smite a round now.",
            "I'm sure they did it out of a mix for consistency's sake and because folks were grumbly about the change originally.\n\n\nWhich is also fair.",
            "Boohoo. I guess Paladins are stuck with just being a Charisma half-caster with the best defensive feature in the game, the best healing feature in the game, getting the new Weapon Mastery features, and having access to new Fighting Styles.",
            "woof, yeah...",
            "Tbf spamming smites never was even really the best use of spell slots most of the time on Paladins. It's just fun.",
            "I mean rogues are by far one of the weakest classes. In the UA they received the least amount of improvements. Compared to the fighter and barbarian the UA rogues are useless. They can\u2019t do a fraction of the damage. Their control is significantly diminished compared to the new control abilities of the fighter and barbarian. Tactical mind and raging to use strength for skill checks puts those martials on a closer playing field to rogues for ability checks. \n\nI\u2019m curious what the end result for rogues is, but I\u2019m concerned that they\u2019ll just continue to diminish their specialities.",
            "They\u2019re just upset they lost their nova turn even though their smite crits will still remove the soul of any target.",
            "But have a dozen other buffs to compensate; bonus action LoH being a big one.",
            "True, true."
