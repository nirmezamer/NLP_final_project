        "content": "Will keep it short but just wanted to rant \n\nWe have a firm, hard line in the sand $500,000 budget and we told our realtor that. We could afford more, but we don\u2019t want to be house poor. We sent our realtor links to 6 houses we liked within this budget (one was actually $510,000 so I guess that broke my rule by a little bit, but it was just like an idea of what we\u2019re looking for generally). \n\nPrices of houses we were shown/sent:\n\n$700,000\n\n$715,000\n\n$799,000\n\n$645,000\n\n$699,000\n\nI re-iterated to the realtor that our budget was $500k and we only wanted to put down $100k, did not want to have to pay PMI. I again sent some houses in our price range that we liked as a guide for what we\u2019re looking for. \n\nRealtor responded and asked if we would be willing to liquidate some of our 401(k) to get a bigger down payment. I actually laughed out loud reading the email because I couldn\u2019t believe how stupid that idea was. Just responded \u201cI think we\u2019ll be using another realtor, thanks for your time\u201d. \n\nSuddenly she was wanting to schedule tours of the homes I had sent her. Like, why am I doing the work? Why am I sending YOU houses? \n\nAnyway, that\u2019s my small rant. Just found it so annoying. ",

            "She wants a bigger payday for herself.  That's all.",
            "You made the right choice. \n\nWho knows what else would have happened if you stayed with that realtor.",
            "We bought our dream house literally a week after firing our realtor. She was holding us back in everything.",
            "Good for you. Liquidating your 401K is terrible advice.",
            "You finding the houses for your realtor doesn\u2019t seem like a red flag to me, both houses I have bought in my life have been ones my wife and I found. With that said, any house we sent over to the realtor was met with a quick response about a walk through and additional information, plus our agent contacting the sellers agent and what not. \n\nMain thing to keep in mind is that they are supposed to be working for you, and if they are not, it\u2019s completely normal to move on.",
            "Yeah that agent was scummy but sending homes to your agent to tour is normal. In fact, it is probably more efficient than having the agent pick out homes that u may not even like and waste both each others time",
            "Looks like she wants a bigger commission",
            "I wish we could just get rid of realtors all together and just pay attorneys to do the paperwork and disclosures. Or, purchasing agents should be paid based on the amount saved from list price or a minimum. When they\u2019re taking a cut of the overall selling price, it feels like they don\u2019t have motivation to negotiate if they know the house is within your budget. Getting 3% for looking up listings, showing the house, and helping with paperwork is crazy. \n\nMaybe 6% total commission made sense when houses were $100-$250k. Now in areas that they\u2019re averaging $400-$600k it seems pretty dumb.",
            "Ai will replace realtors soon. Most people look for their own houses on redfin, realtor, zillow etc and send them to their realtor who then schedules a showing. They are a middle man who refuses to go back to making your venti americano. 5% seller cost to have buyers find your house on a site who then tells their agent to contact your agent... both of those dipshits could be cut out.",
            "Given that everything listed is available to see online and most have open houses, I don't use a realtor to \"see\" anything unless there isn't an open house or I want to see it first. Mine does not suggest anything to me, I tell her what I want to see or if I want to see disclosures for a property.\n\nMy realtor is only there for the offer and closing paperwork/process, and occasionally to show me a place. That's all they're really needed for.",
            "Wow I can't believe she suggested the 401k loan. She's an idiot.",
            "Your realtor knew your credit rating and net worth \u2014 so, wanted to show you more expensive houses to get a bigger commission. Didn\u2019t give a damn about *your* criteria. \n\nYa did the right thing.",
            "We were house hunting. Told our realtor that we needed at least 1 bedroom on the ground floor because my 78 year old mother in law lived with us.\n\nWe were shown:\n\nA quad level, with zero bedrooms on the same floor as a bathroom. \n\nA ranch home, with parking in the basement.\n\nA farm house, with a dining room that could become a bedroom on the main floor, but the only bathroom was upstairs. \n\nA 3 story mansion that was 125k above budget. No ground floor bedrooms, but it did have a non-functional elevator.",
            "My realtor was doing the same shit and a friend of the family. They really are the worst selfish people I\u2019ve ever met",
            "She wanted a bigger payday and got zip zero nada.  Another useless realtor",
            "GOOD FOR YOU!!!  Liquidate your 401k?????  you loose 30-40% of the value beyond the 10K allowed for first time buying (where you only loose the taxes, not the additional 10%, so 20-30% of value!). \n\nI was same.  I \"could\" afford more, but I had a line in the sand of 400K 5 yr ago when I started looking. My realtor was AWESOME and super respectful!!!  And sent loads of good options (those existed in that range back then).  We spent 2 days looked as TONS of houses, and late on second day she says- I know this one is above your budget- but only a little bit, and I think based on your feedback, you will love it. Its had only been on the market 24 hr at that point. \n\nI DID love it.  It was 20K over my 400K limit.  But that is the deal- if you start at 5-75% of max, you end up finding something good around 75-80% at most.  But if you start at 99%...you end up going over and very house poor, well realtor role in the extra cash for their fee. \n\nFind a better partner for your journey. And again  GOOD FOR YOU!",
            "exactly, why are you doing HER work?  real estate agents are the worst and most pathetic.",
            "I recently leaned you don\u2019t need a realtor to buy a home. There are tools out there that will help you manage the process on your own, no annoying realtors to deal with at all! I\u2019m giving a company called Dobode a try right now after having a really hard time with our first realtor",
            "Reading this makes me feel like i would be a great realtor.",
            "You did a great job. \\*You\\* are the one in charge and she needs to deliver according to your needs and desires.",
            "I have heard of realtors who also show you crap houses so that when they finally bring you to a mediocre one with slightly a little over budget you go under contract because you are just tired and think this is as good as it gets",
            "Commissioned jobs like these attract bad or desperate people.  Especially if they are newer and less established. Being told you can make $100K+ in commissions to face the reality of only making a few $hundred makes people bend their morals to make more money.",
            "I had a bit of bumping up against my realtor a couple times wanting to add a couple thousand to my offer, but he eventually got that when I said \"this is all the money I have\" I was serious about it. It's not super hard to be qualified as a realtor. It is super hard to be a good realtor. Sorry you got a shitty one.",
            "Nope, she had her chance, then she insulted your financial literacy.",
            "You are the boss,\u00a0 so yes fire her ass. You send her links and didnt get to see any of them? How stupid. Our realtor tried doing that too. But i right away told her i wanted the one ive seen",
            "Same happened to us. She even called our lender and asked what we were approved for so that she could justify showing us higher priced homes.",
            "About to fire our realtor. Found a unicorn of a good deal and got screwed out of it because of how our realtor handled it. And the way they did things looks like they are either dangerously naive (despite being a realtor for 25 years?) Or they actually wanted us to pay more. Neither is acceptable.\u00a0",
            "I fired a realtor at our first consultation.  She gave the whole spiel about pmi and our down payment budget, and I told her I was going to be financing via a VA loan. She asked me: how long have you worked for the VA? \u2026I told her I don\u2019t work for the VA, I am a veteran. And she looked at me with pitying eyes like I was an idiot and said \u201coh honey, you don\u2019t qualify for a VA loan just by being a veteran you have to ALSO work for the VA!\u201d",
            "I\u2019m currently using a friend as a realtor.\n\nCrazy market, every house is a bidding war.\n\nSearching for a multi family, I accidentally searched single families and found a multi family that was listed incorrectly and because of this was sitting for MONTHS!\n\nI called my realtor and told him \u201chey they listed wrong so it\u2019s not getting much attention, we could probably offer them under asking and they\u2019d go for it, call and set up the walkthrough.\u201d\n\nHe calls me back an hour later saying \u201cthey said they aren\u2019t taking any offers under asking, they\u2019re actually trying to sell it for more than asking price\u201d\n\nMy question to him in the politest way possible was \u201cI asked you to set up a tour, why the hell are you talking to them about price and I haven\u2019t even seen the property yet?\u201d \ud83e\udd14\n\nIf he wasn\u2019t my friend for over 10 years he was definitely getting canned for that. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02",
            "We don\u2019t engage realtors with the financial side of a house purchase - preferring to keep our privacy. By that I mean we get prequalified by a lender before shopping. Then find a realtor who is known to work well in that area. How much we pay down, sources etc., are none of their business.\n\nSo with the prequal, there\u2019s no room for doubt on how much we have for a deal. If, as is often the case, we qualify for more than we want to share with him/her, we have the letter generated for only the maximum amount we want to spend.",
            "Realators are the most unnecessary profession there is and most nowadays are scumbags and con artists who really don\u2019t have much knowledge and re barely capable of doing their job. \n\nThe next thing they would\u2019ve wanted you to do is waive inspection on a home with obvious foundation and electrical issues.",
            "Same happened to us way back when. Bank approved $450K, we were looking to top out at $250K (this was 20 years ago). It is just the two of us and that $250K could buy a 4BR/3BA house in a decent neighborhood. He kept sending us houses in the $350K-$400K range. After a few days of this I told him to stop, and he did. We kept him because he really was aggressive about locating potential homes and getting us in to see them quickly. We have been in this house 20 years.",
            "You should've let those stupid games lead to stupid prizes. \n\nWhat I mean by that is that you should have called your realtor, and said \"wow, we love all these houses, set up a viewing!\". Go to each and every one of those houses with your realtor, then make an offer of 500K. If\\when they go crazy because of that, you say \"hey, we told you that's our budget, we thought you're an expert, and probably realized we could get them for 500K\".",

            "you have weird system in USA in \"realtor buyer\" states and are way overcharged\n\nIn Aus only the seller pays commission and then at about 1-1.5%\n\nThe idea that you pay 6% and both the buyer and seller realtor get 3% each is ludicrous\n\nGiven you can simply Internet search an area with all your criteria just what does a buyer realtor do for you?",
            " You are correct.  Good job.",
            "Definitely made the right choice !",
            "Crazy story I also fired my realtor then within a week and half I went under contract at a house. My new realtor has dine a fantastic job",
            "Definitely believe a realtor shouldn't even speak about financial advice. Their job is to look for houses where you outline a budget and what you're willing to do. I think you did the right thing. Also I'm having that issue where our realtor wasn't doing the work and finding houses we may like even though she knows what we like.",
            "Some realtors will make or break the experience. I had a realtor not know what comps were, gave me zero info on the home as far as tax records and whatnot, all she did was \"we can go see the house now\" and that was it. She could write a basic contract which she also fucked up once. By the time I moved the area and got with my other realtor I had worked with before (the housing market exploded and homes in our price were being sold for $100k over... So we couldn't buy a house before my military move) I was seasoned. I wanted comps for every home I considered to ensure they wouldn't underappraise as the last 3 homes I was under contract with failed to value by 30%+, I wanted tax records, utility and records.. And they were able to provide all of that within 5 minutes. It was wonderful. Finally bought a home through the guy first try once I moved back. Nothing beats having a great realtor, and nothing will exhaust you more than a shit one.",
            "That\u2019s good. I\u2019ll be mindful when I pull the trigger. It\u2019s a business transaction.",
            "Just remember that everyone out there is out to make a dime off of you. If that\u2019s the case, make them work for it by not being a pushover. \n\nYou seem to have this under control though.",
            "Their 3 percent incentivizes them to lead buyers to more expensive homes.  I'll be happy when flat fees and contracts become the norm in the market.",
            "people like that should not be realtors, I probably wouldn't stop there",
            "Realtor probably needs a new boat and you weren't doing it the job",
            "That's nuts. We found a great realtor who stuck with us throughout a 6 month search, was never pushy but kept our heads out of the sand.\n\nBy the end we narrowed in on a bunch of criteria and we were getting notified of homes before they listed. That helped us be first through the door and get an accepted offer! Closing in July.\n\nWe did fire one realtor previous to our current, but that's mainly because we got matched with them via a website lol.",
            "Realtors are motivated by the sale price because it quite literally determines their commission. The system is all backwards it\u2019s actually shocking. How are we supposed to trust someone that would BENEFIT from a deal less favourable to their own client. I prefer to do my own research and only use the realtor to complete the paper work. Things like Realtor or Zillow are a good start but if you like data I saw something called Investince companion on product hunt that I\u2019m waiting for.",
            "This is not the way to go about realtors, to \u201csend them emails to show what we generally want\u201d.\n\nI have always done this: gone on the internet daily and found the places I wanted to see. Then told the realtor: \u201cI want to see this and this and this house tomorrow\u201d. \n\nEither she shows up and opens the door or not. If not, I find a realtor that does.\n\nThere is absolutely no need to have them send you anything if you already have the time to look on Redfin or Zillow. It\u2019s not that there are hundreds of new homes popping up in your desired area and price range daily, correct? So you might as well just find the listings yourself and just inform the realtor to show up to open the doors.\n\nWhat you CAN tell them is to send you any unlisted homes that they get a lead on (in your price range), but I wouldn\u2019t bother with them sending you publically available listings from Redfin or Zillow.",
            "She should not be asking you about pulling from your 401k, only your lender should have that conversation with you.\n\nI would have a chat instead of firing her outright to see where she is coming from and why I\u2019m being ignored.",
            "You made the right choice. I also had to find my own houses and regret staying with the realtor because it only got worse.",
            "I ended up doing all the work in our situation as well. We also had to jump a bit above our stated budget because our realtor slept on the 6 listing I sent her in our budget that were perfect and they got snapped up. We ended up buying for around 25k over our wanted budget when we could\u2019ve gotten something 20k under our budget. \n\nDon\u2019t compromise in these positions because it\u2019s your money and your purchase.",
            "You did the right thing. I wish I had went with my gut and fired the RE agent I used.",
            "I didn't even get that far with my realtor. She asked if we were open to a condo since we're in a hcol area. I said we were a long as it's it's the kind where each unit had a separate entrance since we had a senior dog and didn't want to walk her through a lobby to go outside. Guess which kind of listings she sent us...",
            "Good for you!",
            "The liquidating 401k would be an insta fire. \n\nI don\u2019t see any issue with sending your realtor homes. You have access to all the homes on sale and you know what you want best. While I agree you should have dumped your realtor, I\u2019d still be proactive in your search. \n\nBest of luck in finding your next agent. I had to fire mine when I sold my first house. Only regret was I didn\u2019t do it sooner.",
            "It's a relationship business, and if they can't abide, wave them off.\n\nI'd have a conversation with their broker, too, but I am a bit of a jerk, so there's that.",
            "I was in the same boat but different situation. I asked for homes less than 400k. The area I was looking only had 3/2.5, max 2300 at that price point. Agent tried to persuade me to look at a higher budget(500k) and 4/3.5 and I said NO many times and nearly fired her, even though I could afford it.\n\nPut a contract on a 3/2.5 below 400k with $8k deposit. During the build, noticed the little subdivision filled with 3/2.5 was surrounded with homes 4/3.5s and that was the preference of the area. Also previous houses with 3/2.5 did not appreciate or sell anywhere close to the 4/3.5. The biggest issue was that the actual house felt smaller than the model home and if we had 1 more kid and in laws visiting, the house would be full.\n\nI told my realtor I should have listened to her, canceled my contract ( lost 8k deposit), and immediately purchased a pre built at $70k more that had 4/3.5, 500 more Sq ft,  bigger backyard, covered patio. It's actually appraised $60k more since we closed in november based on the latest comps in the area as I was the first on the street. Also got a 4.99% fixed rate and $10k closing, which was originally the agents bonus paid by the builder, and she graciously gave us. My house is surrounded by $600k -$700k luxury homes. I won't have a problem selling this home ever.\n\nMy point is take a look at the homes in your price point but also be open-minded and see what the realtor wants to show you as it could be worth it.",
            "you fired your realtor for communication problems. seems reasonable",
            "We had to fire our first realtor for the same thing. Luckily our second one was amazing, and it was like a night and day experience. Don\u2019t give up hope lol",
            "Most are parasites, sorry not sorry.",
            "Had a similar thing when interviewing. I talked to a couple agents that suggested doing the most.   \n  \nOne who insisted I needed to finance to get a median house in HCOL (by myself) when I specifically said I wanted no mortgage. \n\nAnother suggested breaking up my lump sum into two down payments and renting the 2nd home out..\n\nIf I wanted a big empty million dollar home or to get another rental property I would have said so.",
            "Yeah that\u2019s way over budget\u2026\nMaybe they got greedy for a commission but you made right decision to fire her.",
            "Most agents are just as useless",
            "Nice. I would\u2019ve been inclined to ask him for his client list so I could email them all and tell them not to listen to the clown giving advice to liquidate 401K\u2019s to buy houses.",
            "You did the right thing. The realtor just wanted to collect a fat commission. It\u2019s been a terrible spring for them and they are starving. But that\u2019s not our problem.",
            "I mean it's clear as day what is happening here. She wanted a bigger cut and the only way to do that is to upsell you. All these realtors see these trash ass reality TV drama shows in high-cost areas with scumbag realtors and want to do the same.  At the end of the day, they want their EOY commission money to be the highest possible and don't give two shits about you. Don't just fire them, out them for who they are.",
            "This is why I will NEVER use a friend or family member as my Realtor when I buy a house. That is too big of a purchase to have a rep be subpar and you are afraid to fire them. I want to be able to fire them with zero remorse if they aren't meeting my needs.",
            "Good move, you literally had to fire her to get her to do what you needed her to do in the first place.\n\nNEXT!",
            "I have bought 2 houses in my lifetime. Never used a realitor to buy a house. I don't really know why anyone would use a realtor to purchase a house. I can call a realtor that's selling a house to set up a viewing its not rocket science.",
            "The Realtor is supposed to work FOR you, not the other way around.  Sounds like they wanted a bigger commission by upselling you.\n\n  \nBTW - I would ***NEVER*** liquidate some of my 401(k) for a bigger down-payment.  You'd be paying your normal tax rate (or up a bracket), plus a 10% penalty for early withdrawal.  So that is probably around a 35% rate to get some more money for a down payment, to avoid paying \\~1% PMI.  Any person who would suggest that does NOT belong in Real Estate.",
            "Good. For-shit realtors pollute the industry",
            "Depends on the market...can negotiate. I went above my firm price and negotiated down.\n\n$200k off...probably never happening in my lifetime so that was stupid.",
            "I would send my realtor houses bc he was constantly on the road and I got the Zillow alerts before he would even be notified. But what he did was constant the seller if it was a different agency, get reports on EVERYTHING, and if there were problems he messaged me right away. There was no sugar coating any of it. \n\nYou did the right thing here.",
            "You did the right thing. A friend of ours had to fire their realtor as she was not showing them anything and my friends had to send her links to the houses they were interested in. \nThe realtor also pushed them to put down an offer on a very bad apartment. After this they let her go and hired  another one. \nThey bought a house a few weeks back and are really happy about their purchase.",
            "Yep . In my country the process works differently but the realtors also don\u2019t seem to understand price limits. Wasted so much time and effort while not buying a home.",
            "I am flirting with like 3 realtors and having them send stuff. One I friended on Facebook cuz she volunteered at the humane shelter and I\u2019m shopping realtors. Well I told her I was preapproved for $180,000. She keeps sending houses in the $200,000+ range. On Facebook she\u2019s always on vacation or doing expensive stuff and not worth it. The other realtor sends stuff and checks in but they\u2019re not always in the location I want.",
            "This makes me angry. Such a dumb shitty realtor",
            "\ud83e\udd2e you did the right thing",
            "Our first realtor cost us a few places. First one we looked at with her, she said she would \u201cfight for us\u201d (her actual words), then the next day they had a cash offer come in while we were on the phone with people trying to figure out finances on it and she rolled right over and was no help to us.\n\nNext one we looked at and wanted to put in an offer, she drafted an offer letter but had a couple things wrong so I didn\u2019t sign off and asked her to tweak them so I could sign it and she could submit it. It took her a week to send it back to me, I signed it and sent it back to her that night, the next morning she sent it in at 9:30 AM and apparently the seller had received another offer the night before. Then she had the gall to tell my wife to tell me to \u201cjust sign it and we can change it later\u201d\u2026\n\nThe next one we wanted to look at, we knew it was probably going to go quick, but she wasn\u2019t available to tour it with us until three days later. Next morning it was pending.",
            "My realtor (buyer side) throw a last minute TC charge of 500 bucks at closing.. didn\u2019t tell me anything about it, I thought it was part of a needed transaction. Turns out he was charging me without previously disclosing this TC charge . TC is a transaction coordinator. All through the process I felt he was more eager to close a sale more worried about his commission than anything. I should had gone with a different realtor. There some bumm realtors out there, watch out.",
            "She seems awful. Hope you find a good one!",
            "That realtor deserved to be fired. Real estate is too big of a purchase to have someone dishonest representing you. \n\nI fired one years ago, we told her what we were looking for and price range. She kept showing us houses at the bottom of our range that were uninhabitable. Like should be torn down. She kept telling us that it was all we could afford.

You needing to send the realtor houses isn't a red flag, although you should communicate with them and tell them if you prefer to be more hands off and will not be browsing yourself online and will be primarily relying on them to search.\n\nThat said, good call firing this realtor.  They should not be sending you houses dramatically above your stated price range.  Maybe if what you're looking for was totally unrealistic in your price range, showing you one house outside it to show you how much money it would take to get those things.

            "Ugh I'm sorry this happened to you. I share your frustration and give you kudos for sticking to your budget. I had a similar situation happen with a realtor where she based the convo around \"finding other opporuntities to find cash.

She scheduled a showing so my husband could see it otherwise she only had to schedule 2 showings for us. I even told her exactly what I wanted to offer on the house. We did a pretty low offer that I\u2019m sure she thought would never fly. Trying to make you look at more expensive houses is a different matter. That\u2019s not okay and is a good reason to look for someone else. Depending on what your market is like it might not be a bad idea to look at some houses just a bit over your budget. Our house was first listed for 420k, then dropped to 390 and we got it for 300k but our market has cooled a bit. We also mostly looked at houses that had been on the market for months.",

            "I think it really depends on what you want from your realtor. We used a realtor to buy our house and we did most of the work of actually finding candidate properties because all that shit is online. Our realtors job was to get us into showings of things we liked and give us whatever information she could dig up on potential properties and then to do the negotiating on our behalf when it was time to make an offer. We didn't need her to find houses for us or tell us what we wanted, we knew that better than her. What we needed her to be is someone who has a ton of contacts in the industry and the knowledge of what makes a good offer.\n\nShe wound up getting a house for under listing price and with about $15,000 in seller credits in a pretty aggressive market because she correctly concluded that the house was overpriced and had some undesirable qualities that would limit offers and was willing to beat up the selling agent over flaws with the house. She was right, we got the place for a price that we could afford, walked into it with an emergency fund still intact and with instant equity because it appraised for close to $20K more than we paid.\n\nI guess what I am saying is that a good agent isn't necessarily someone who is better at finding likely houses than you are. No one is going to know what you want better than you do. A good agent is someone who can do the part that you DON'T know how to do. Our agent was a jerk, and that is precisely what we needed them to be.",

Good for you! \n\nI was also having such a tremendous clusterfuck of a process working with a realtor early on, she literally made it harder to see a home than if I had just pinged the listing agents unrepresented (which is what I ended up doing after I fired her and it was a breeze).",

Almost every house for sale at the time was a foreclosure. After 3 viewings and 1 attempted offer, he wanted us to sign a contract. I told him it wasn't working. Found a realtor couple that had never worked in foreclosures and short sales, but they seemed optimistic and started working with them. It was the best decision I could have made. \n\nBought and sold first house with them. Selling the first house was a long process because of the market, and when we finally got an offer it was 30 days to close. Needing to find and close on a house was crazy in 30 days. My ex and I took a day off work a couple days later, and we looked at 10 houses in 1 day. 11 viewings because we went back to the house we wanted to put an offer on. It was like a 12-hour day by the time they drew up an offer and we signed. \n\nDuring the divorce, they sold house 2.

We only went with her because she worked with our credit union. Thankfully the next guy we picked WAS local. He knew a lot about the area.

Luckily, our realtor kicked ass in getting the price down to the point that the seller's realtor was complaining how little they were going to make.  \n\nThe upside of a sold as-is home is I had more leverage from my inspection.

We would give him listings, tell him to schedule tours, and come back the next day. It was like starting fresh when we did. Where did you want to look ? At the listings we gave you yesterday. We eventually found a house in the neighborhood we liked, and then after missing out on it, we found another that was similar down the street. He didn't do emails. So he missed a problem in the closing contract. We had to get it redone last minute because we caught it before signing. Part of our bid was the bank would pay closing, and we would pay more in total price. They agreed, but didn't put it in the contract.

They setup the inspection and were able to recommend people who could do some minor repairs as well as a roofing company. Then at the closing they got us a bottle of Veuve and some Tiffany champagne glasses which was a really nice touch. \n\nKeep in mind, your realtor is likely going to make about $15,000 off you. Think about that number then ask yourself if you\u2019re getting $15k worth of service. We certainly did.",
            "I\u2019m more intrigued that you\u2019re a first time homebuyer with 100k to put down, good for you!",
            "Same thing happened to us. I finally said enough and did my own research. Bought from owner with no realtor involved.",
            "I really despise these kind of realtors. Greed, greed, greed.",
            "Don't know why I was showed this sub reddit and post but I hate greedy salespeople like that. Had to buy a new mattress and went to GardenerWhite and told them my budget was $1000, the fucker starts showing me mattresses that cost $5000 to $3500 and I just got pissed and left. Never again am I going there. These fuckers just want a bigger cut.",
            "Agents are the worst, hence why they\u2019re being phased out of the process. Not needed anymore with internet",
            "Always remember,  the realtor works for you!",
            "I\u2019ve only bought one house thus far.  And I had a very similar experience where I had to find the house.  When we asked if we could go check it out he was like it\u2019s not in the realtor website.  I was like there is a sale sign at the door!\n\nOnly reason we stuck with ours was we got a deal through the bank if we used him.  \n\nThe laziness of some realtors is beyond ridiculous.",
            "And let me guess - that realtor is probably one of the top in her marketplace with hundreds of good reviews?",
            "I've not really worked with a good realtor. The ones I have worked with have been adequate. The best was a family friend and we did most of the shopping, he just used his MLS to get access and then handled the paperwork, communication, etc. So honestly he may have been great but  we knew exactly what we were looking for and my wife was unemployed and on Zillow 4 hours a day at that point in the move.\n\nA lot of them are quite thirsty. On standard commissions every extra $100K on the transaction is another $3K for them. Since the median income for agents is like $65K a year that's significant. I'm sure they also go through the delisons of grandeur a lot, with potential clients wants actually costing 20% or more than their initial budget. And of course, for future referrals, if you end up being unhappy with your home you're not going to refer your agent to someone else. \n\nHowever, most clients probably are not extraordinarily financially astute but a good agent knows how to read their client and listens. Thus, you did the right thing. Agents are numerous, as everyone seems to think it's a side hustle.",
            "That the one part I didn't understand with having a realtor \nIs like why am I the one have to look for houses all the time and send you the information why are you not doing anything. \nI was stressing out over finding a house so bad lately I ended up in hospital be of stress of trying to find a house and in 3 years of looking I lost almost 200k on trying to find a house",
            "She sounds pretty useless",
            "Realtors (not all) do this a lot. They'll show you in your price range then show you above so you can \"see what's out there and what you can get if you raised your budget.\"  It's all about that commission. You see something super nice send they hope you fall in love enough to go into debt you can't afford. If they're not showing you listings you send run don't walk to another realtor.",
            "She showed you the internet replaced her. Don\u2019t use a realtor people.",
            "Realtors are a scam job",
            "Wow what a fool he is. And so disrespectful.",
            "Tip: don\u2019t get your own realtor. Use the listing agent. You\u2019ll have a way better chance of buying.",
            "Heck, my realtor wouldn\u2019t even show me houses that were above what I was approved for. We got our approval raised when we negotiated a lower interest rate and he confirmed with the lender before showing us more expensive houses.",
            "I work in real estate as a marketing director for a firm. You are absolutely in the right. We actually just fired an agent because he didn\u2019t want to take leads that were under like $800k. He was also a new realtor, so that probably won\u2019t pan out for a while for him. \nSadly, some realtors are only in it for the money and not to actually help people find their perfect home. It\u2019s ridiculous, but true. Those aren\u2019t the kind of realtors you want. I would\u2019ve done the same thing!",
            "I listed my home with a realtor came up with a firm sale price. Two days later she comes to me with an offer 45% under that price which was 65% under the list price. Tried to get me to accept it because ( it\u2019s the best offer she\u2019s had) it had been on the market two days! Ended my contract with her that day waited six months listed it with a different agent and sold it for 10% over asking.",

            "It all depends on the market you are in, but when I worked in real estate it was common knowledge that, on average, homes would sell for about 10% less than the listing price. Of course in today's market we sometimes see home buyers bidding for prices above the advertised listing price. Again, it all depends on the market you are buying into, but it is worth submitting bids under the asking price if you are interested in a property.",
            "It\u2019s all about their commission.",
            "Real estate agents are the biggest scammers ever. What is the purpose in today\u2019s world anyway?",
            "You found several homes in your price range and that you presumably liked.\n\nMost agents are worthless. I hate that they\u2019re a necessity in most cases.",
            "I purchased a home over budget but no by a lot. It has turned out to be a fantastic investment and home. Real Estate agents work on commission so they want to sell up. Get a buyers agent that works for you.",
            "The market is flooded with realtors and alot have very little experience.  The knowledge needed to pass the real estate licensing test doesn't actually equate to real estate knowledge.  I should know.  I had to my license for property management reasons and I promise you there's no way in hell i could be a competent realtor.\n\nYou did the right thing by firing her.  She sounds awful.",
            "This happened to us and we were buying our first house. Realtor explained how we could afford things. We put an offer on a house that was 25k above our budget (250).and 50 over asking. It was accepted. Our offer was contingent on inspection and the inspection failed hard. Our realtor kept pressuring us to stay with the deal and that the 50k in repairs was not a big deal and we could always get a loan. I fired his ass on the spot, called his supervisor and explained what happened, and then told them to fuck off. \n\nWe are now in a much better house because we found a realtor who cares about us and not about the paycheck.",
            "Now imagine the people who rely on the realtor because they don\u2019t have the financial acumen for such decisions. People blindly follow advice from \u201cprofessionals\u201d without realizing the pros are hawking a product always/forever with limited exceptions.",
            "Realtors are shit from my experience. When I was looking for my first house I had a hard time finding a decent house in my price range (less than 100k). I ended up finding a house I liked same day it was listed. Realtor took me to look at it and I wanted to put in an offer. I asked him for advice on what to offer and he pretty much just shrugged his shoulders and said it was up to me. Being young and naive I ended up paying asking price for it.\n\n 6 years later I found out I overpaid and sold the house at a $12000 loss. Hard lesson learned that he didn't want advise me on resale value and make a lower offer because the less I paid the less he would make on commission. I did get lucky and sold the house myself and only paid something like $300 bucks to a lawyer to write up my sales contract instead of paying 5% or more  for the privelage of them posting some pictures on a website.",
            "In my opinion real estate is fairly complicated, at least behind the scenes, therefore part-time real estate sales people, soccer moms, just don't have the experience to properly serve their clients \nAgain this is just my experience your experience may be different",
            "The problem is that all of them do",
            "I think the agent must\u2019ve gotten this buyer confused with someone else. No way you\u2019re sending houses *40%* over budget. That\u2019s insane. \n\nOh, and to the point about getting you to spend more money. No one cares. Getting you to spend even a crazy $100k extra only nets the average agent, what? A couple thousand after all is said and done? Maybe? It could be way less. Contrary to popular belief, agents don\u2019t get paid enough to upsell you, they actually get paid *too little* to care how much you spend.",
            "The only industry that the worse of a job you do for your client, the more you get paid.",
            "Our first realtor was like that. She got fired. Our second di a *really* good job; either showing stuff only in budget, or, the house we got which was way out of budget, but she was pretty sure was over priced. We ended up getting the place (which was fantastic) for just a hair over. (Like 5k on a half million house)",
            "The pay difference is pretty negligible compared to getting the sale quicker.  100k is sales price is only 3k commission before the split and/or referral fees.  You are also almost never going to get someone to up there budget that much.  Selling a house quickly at 500k is much more lucrative than trying to talk the buyer in to buying a 600k house.",
            "I almost got fired for showing homes 50k over budget. Never again.",
            "She would have downplayed major defects",
            "Most realtors are con artists. Basically salespeople with a realtors lisence. They sell what they want to sell you, not what you want to buy. I can tell you a milllion stories or dummy illegal realtor behavior.",
            "The audacity to tell someone to liquidate their 401k. This is not someone I would trust with the biggest transaction of my life.",
            "Saaaame. After almost a year of house hunting, I contracted on my literal dream starter house 20 days after firing my old realtor and hiring a new one.",
            "Explain please,  curious to hear your story.",
            "Don\u2019t ever listen to a buyers realtor. Initially they are there to open doors, that\u2019s it. Later they are there for the paperwork. They are not specialists for home construction, nor should they give you advice how to do some repair (because they aren\u2019t technicians). \nAgain, THEY ARE THERE TO OPEN DOORS AND DO THE PAPERWORK.\nEven telling me about the wall color is TMI and just another persons opinion. Fuck\u2019em!",
            "Us too. Don\u2019t feel bad for a second.",

            "Do tell.",
            "Nearly the same. We asked Realtor #1 about a specific house. She replied \u201c oh, it\u2019s not a great location.\u201d It happens to be in one of the more desirable locations of our town. We saw a few more houses and asked again. \u201cOh, it\u2019s pretty chopped up, little flow among rooms, you wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d Instead she\u2019d show us over priced houses that needed tons of work. Fired her a week later. New Realtor, no questions asked, showed us the house. Bought the house, it\u2019s got solid bones and it was move in ready, we love it.",
            "How did you find a good one and where? Any tips???",
            "Congratulations! Did you get another realtor or do it on your own?",
            "The first realtor I worked with really stunted my ability to go to more viewings and explore my options. She told me that real estate was her second job, and that was clear to see. I understand having other aspects of life (kids, pets, etc) but she had zero hustle and it wouldn't take long for houses to go off the market like *that.* I met a much better realtor on my own, and I'm sure he could have found me the perfect home if it wasn't for my personal finances.",
            "Happened to us too! Not exactly dream home, but something that was actually in budget and fit the neighborhood style we wanted.",
            "Very scummy. Idk if it's shadiness or just being stupid.",
            "Came here to say that. The realtor has probably already conned others out of liquidating their 401k\u2019s to pay for houses they can\u2019t afford so that she can get a bigger commission. Scummy.",
            "It's one thing to borrow against it to be non-contingent and pay back when your current house sells if you're short like 40k. Liquidating is really dumb.",
            "Same. Our agent showed us a couple houses that she picked to get us an idea of what the market looked like and then left it to us to find what we wanted. She would also get us into showings within minutes of finding something we wanted, could tell us all about every listing we found, and knew guys that could do quick inspections and quotes on repairs, aggressively negotiated any offer we wanted to make, and guessed to within a few thousand what a house would ultimately sell and appraise for.",
            "Had a realtor who did the same. Showed me crappy homes that were way overpriced though in my range. She had backup homes priced 100k over what I wanted to pay. I have a good paying 6 figure job and the whole time she kept trying to push my budget higher and higher. I also don\u2019t want to be house poor. I left her quick.",
            "No, in the last seven years 99% of my buyers have brought the house that they wanted to me. While I do send them lots of homes and spend time looking for exactly what they want, sometimes I can't always see that thing that stands out to them in a home, that makes them say this is the house.",
            "Agreed! I\u2019m on house 4 and I\u2019ve always sent the home I was interested in to my realtor. They will of course have automated searches set up that email me listings each day based on my parameters. But for the most part they are setting up showings and pulling comps/detail for the homes I was interested and the neighborhoods/amenities.",
            "Agree. The house I finally bought the realtor didn\u2019t initially show me because it was above the initial price range I asked to look at. I ended up negotiating down to my price range.",
            "Sure, but the commission difference between a 600,000 house and a 500,000 house isn't big enough to warrant spending a couple extra months showing a client around to houses they can't afford.",
            "The crazy part is that it would still probably be cheaper with attorneys on both sides rather than realtors. You would have much more educated representation also.",
            ">Just pay attorneys instead \n\nYou know your profession is scummy when people would rather deal with lawyers lmao",
            "Just some leeches on society",

            "This only goes for lower priced areas\n\nLuxury residential or even mid-range looks nothing like this and it\u2019s a much more complicated process",
            "AI will replace many industries soon. But baristas, cleaners, farmers - the service class you think you are better than will continue.",
            "I used Redfin. Different times during the rush a few years back, but aside from unlocking the doors, evaluating property as a second set of eyes for disclosures such as cast iron plumbing, foundation issues, etc, everything else I sourced on my own. My agent did send me a few extra properties to review out of the 50 or so I booked on my own,  but to your point, they just take the emotion out of the numbers. \n\nI also found a great, unbiased and thorough home inspection company outside their network and set my own bank financing deals.",
            "This was how I did it too. My sister however is in a hotter market, where a lot of listings never make it to Zillow. \n\nThey had to get a realtor whom was in the know, someone whom could have showings arranged the day the MLS dropped.",
            "It is very dependent on the competitiveness of the market. Our realtor was great and got us into private showings the moment homes hit MLS, before they hit zillow or redfin. We placed offers on those homes within 1 hour of the showing and often before the official open house, repeated that a few times to close on our current home.",
            "That's why I will not use a buyer's agent unless the seller is paying.  I can find my own inspector and be with him/her during the inspection, find my own title company and hire an attorney for the paperwork.  I won't need a lender.  The agents charge way too much for what they provide with little recourse if there is a problem.",
            "Same thing here. We\u2019re under contract currently, we found the house. We went to their open house. I just called my realtor after we exited the house, my wife said she liked it, and i immediately called my realtor and said send them an offer.",
            "My realtor would send me listings about a day before they showed up on the rest of the housing websites so that was pretty nice.",
            "It doesn\u2019t sound like you need an agent at all",
            "You wait for open houses to see a home? Why?\n\nI tried to see homes asap & make an offer that day, why be part of the herd (unless I'm misunderstanding?)",
            "Why the fuck would you let your realtor know about your net worth? I have a mortgage broker who knows those things. I found the realtor separately",
            "Yeah let us know bc I would love the idea of no realtor commission",
            "Interesting, once you\u2019re through the process you\u2019ll have to let us know how it went.",
            "Until you have a client who thinks they can get a $600K property for 50% off.",
            "Honestly after my buying experience I\u2019ve been thinking about it lol. I would be a \u201chands off\u201d realtor, charge a flat rate that wouldn\u2019t be much maybe 1-3k. I\u2019ll send you some suggestions but really I\u2019m just there for negotiations and information. \n\nIn this day and age, everything is online and you can schedule most viewings yourself online. I did the entire buying process myself and spoke to the lender directly. My realtor who was my cousin simply filled in some blanks, and was my middleman to the other realtor. \n\nI know there\u2019s a few other people like me who want to do the house shopping mostly independent.",
            "If you're willing to listen to your clients wants and needs and put their goals and dreams ahead of everything else, you will make an excellent realtor and if you're seriously interested, I could probably put you in contact with someone who could get you through school for free. We need more people like you. More agents need to realize it's not about us. It's about our clients.",
            "My initial reaction was \u201cbecause you\u2019d be good at getting people to liquidate their 401ks\u2026?\u201d I trust that is not what you meant now lol.",
            "Did your lender give her the information?  I would have fired the lender as well if they did.",
            "Because it\u2019s ridiculous to go tour a house if there\u2019s absolutely no chance you\u2019ll be able to buy it. Wasting everyone\u2019s time.",
            "This! We also asked our lender to only be prequalified up to the maximum payment we were comfortable with, and we had done enough research to feel comfortable with the housing choices in that range. It really helped a lot to keep our realtor on track and for us to not be tempted to look at more expensive properties. When the lender initially told us how much we *could* qualify for, I almost spit out my drink. I actually laughed and told her she should absolutely not lend us that much money.",
            "I\u2019m glad it worked out for you. Yeah, our pre-approval is for $1.1M. Which, by the way, seems absolutely ridiculous. We cannot afford a $1.1M house, especially because my wife plans to stop working for a few years once we have kids. \n\nWe are very debt averse though and live well below our means. We both grew up pretty poor and have lots of financial trauma from parents bankruptcies, repos, etc.",
            "No, we\u2019re not interested in any of the homes she showed us. They were far too lavish for a first home. We are not looking for a forever home, just a starter home. She was showing us giant 3000 square foot houses with outdoor kitchens and giant pools etc. when we just want a simple 3/2.",
            "Many Americans agree with you. Most, probably.",
            "It's been the opposite experience for me, though I know what you're saying. I was referred by family to a buyer agent that was absolutely terrible. Slow to respond, constant excuses, \"didn't get my text, email\" \"Oops! I'm suddenly on vacation overseas!\" \"Oops! I got hacked and lost your info!\" etc. She would not sign the release of agency form. Her broker was completely unresponsive. Complaining to the local BoR would have gone to the same broker because he was on the board. I had no prior experience buying and I was locked down for a year.\n\nHired my cousin against my previous policy of not working with friends or family and she's been awesome. Everyone prior had said she was awesome. Won multiple awards, happy with her work ethic, etc. She found us a house last year and has been working with us on the long haul of finding the right piece of land for my current project.",

            "Yup. Tons of homes in the 400-500 range. I knew what I wanted and there\u2019s tons of inventory. 400-500 around here is a decent starter home, there\u2019s actually lots in the 300-400 range too.",

I'm sure the inspector we hired had simply sat in his car checking off stuff.  It cost the seller $6K to have it replaced when I called my grandson's realtor who was at the closing--she had it OK'd immediately.  The poor seller had to put it on a credit card.

I answer questions, make calls to the lender to clarify issues, and keep them on track with paperwork the lender needs. I show up for all inspections and recommend my buyer be there too so they can ask questions. I go over the report with the buyer and explain what issues have to be fixed for the type of loan they have. I show up for estimates, structural engineers and surveyors. I call county auditors, health departments and check flood plains. Communicate with title and make sure my client knows how much they need to bring to closing and I show up at closing.

If you get accepted, talk to an inspector, make sure things look good and the house doesn't have any issues you're not comfortable with, talk to the title company and they'll handle things from there.",
            "Have you read the nightmare a buyer write about a few days ago on Reddit? Her realtor suggested a roofer to replace a roof, they closed the deal, roof was worked on by that roofer and a year later the new roof needs work. So the buyer, now owner,  finds out her realtor had recommended an unlicensed roofer who now ghosts her. Go figure! I bet the realtor had a deal going with the roofer, maybe it was her father in law or who knows who! \u2014 So yeah, some of those realtors are charlatans who are doing this only for themselves. Never trust a recommendation for a technician/worker from a realtor! As a buyer, find your workers yourself\u2026.",
            "Yes. But I'd rather pay them directly and negotiate a fixed price. Until we can roll the buyer realtor cost I to the loan from the buyer side, it won't happen. Which is weird, since we're doing that indirectly now anyway.",
            "There's no reason why the realtor can't say this.",
            "Except OP sent a list of houses that were possibly acceptable which I assume those checked the boxes.",
            "I\u2019m all about hiring a realtor when I\u2019m selling because I know they definitely do a better job than I could at selling it for top dollar, but as far as buying goes, yeah I really can\u2019t see what they\u2019re gonna do that I can\u2019t.",
            "So there are a lot of variables, you can't escape certain things. TN has no sales tax or Florida.  Escrow is going to happen or pay your taxes up front.  But in just realtor fees.  Most people pay for a ton of extra fees not just the commission.  Those are the things I am talking about.  Take your time at closing and read everything.  Taxes, insurance for your area is what it is.  This is a huge topic, lots of good reddit on this.  Don't trust just me.",
            "It basically doesn't anymore in my area, unfortunately. It's gonna be a LONG time. This was back in 2019 and I can only imagine it got worse. Our house is now taxed at 300k, even tho there's no way we could actually find a buyer at that price I'd think. It barely passed inspection, it's tiny, there was a LOT of work to hide how bad the blackberry and ivy infestation is in the yard, the plumbing and wiring is sketch as hell because the owner did it all. \n\nIt took nearly a year of constant looking and we only lucked out because so many people were passing on it for all the signs we missed/chose to ignore.",
            "I'd have to find her info again but when I do I'll DM you! She works mostly northern western WA, kinda made an exception for us lol",
            "There's a house for sale on our block that is asking $500k and it's worth _maybe_ $400k. Owner died and family is trying to milk it for a payday. Been listed for months while a dozen other houses have sold in the same timeframe. (High-traffic, military area.)",
            "Yup, always be transparent.",
            "I think if you explain it and they\u2019re good with it that\u2019s a good strategy.",
            "My buyer realtor recommended his guy to do the inspection. Cash only. Seemed a bit rushed (but, he was available very fast).\n\nIf I was to hire a guy, I'd expect to spend a few hours with him going over everything. I am fairly experienced with home repairs because I've owned a home for a while now and I'm handy. The inspection didn't tell me anything I couldn't see myself, but it was good to have a second set of eyes.\n\n\nContingencies have a due date, so you don't really have the opportunity to do research and compare companies. If the realtor knows a guy who can do it tomorrow, you go with that guy.\n\nIf we didn't have the system we have, there would be better services to help through the process.",
            "These are normal home costs and are part of home ownership no matter if you use a Realtor or a lawyer. There are not usually any fees for buyers. You're just wrong, sold hundreds of homes for buyers and there are no extra fees. There are fees but like I stated earlier these are home ownership costs.",
            "Ugh",
            "Do you regret it or nah? Even with all the fixes.",
            "Happens all the time, there\u2019s a house in my moms neighborhood where they over did the house,  all modern layout and fixtures, built extension on the back. Then they wanted to list it 150k over market price thinking they will get it.  Been on the market 3 months.  No price reductions.  Just letting it sit because they over built the neighborhood",
            "Personally no regrets, but it is a mixed bag. We were thankfully able to work with the seller on the electric, so that got added into the loan. Otherwise we couldn't afford it. There's SO MANY things we have to do that just wouldn't be an issue if this was a normal, well maintained house but. At least we have one. Our mortgage + repairs is less than rent in the same area for an apartment the same size and we have a yard + no landlord to fuck with us as a cherry on top. \n\nIf I was less handy around the house or had higher standards for my living space, it would be really rough. Nearly not worth it rough. But having a fairly stagnant \"rent\" after years chasing cheaper rentals and being stuck in shitty places, I'd rather be stuck in a mid place that I own. At least I can paint the walls and know nobody has the right to come in with 24 hours notice.",
            "I often wonder if I did this with our house. I don\u2019t see this as my final home, but it certainly could be. It was a builder basic track home when we bought it 9 years ago. Our upgrades include resurface the pool, (pepbletec), new patio cover, full house with bamboo floors, marble countertops in kitchen, new cabinet faces with solid wood cabinets, full gut and remodel in master bath with very high end Italian tile, and US/German fixtures, etc. still have the garage to do. I\u2019ve basically turned this builder basic track home to a nicer custom feel but it still has the same structural design, just with high end stuff. (Well except for the bathroom). I\u2019ve put probably in total $120k in upgrades to the house since we\u2019ve owned it, and we do love our home. (Although I\u2019m still always on Realtor.com looking at a place with some property.  However the last thing I want to do is embark on another fixer upper, and nice homes on property are just out of my price range. So, here I stay, in my beautiful track home.",
            "That\u2019s a good perspective thank you. I\u2019m not terribly handy unfortunately.",
            "Yeah, you have to account for your neighborhood when listing.  My example, the house is listed 125k over the next highest sale in the neighborhood without being a bigger sqft house.   While those finishes will probably make you the next highest neighborhood sale, it wont get you an insane more amount. Kitchens and bathroom upgrades get your money back but when you go high end finishes, you won\u2019t recoup it most likely.  Enjoy it though while your there"

There is a program where I live where the state pays me to stay home with her. I'm making a lot more now being paid to do the things I was doing anyway. We are much better off physically too. I wasn't really sleeping or eating trying to work full time and take care of her full time as well. Now she has the care she needs, and I'm able to take care of myself better.\n\nI wasn't expecting the pay increase, but I am very grateful. It was enough of an increase to get into this house that we are going to make completely accessible to her. \n\nMy realtor is one of my best friends. She really helped me out. My lender is one of her friends. He really cut me a deal on closing costs, and he found me an awesome down-payment assistance loan. \n\nPreviously, we were in an apartment that has no emergency exit for handicapped people. I was really afraid something would happen and we would have no way to get her out.",
