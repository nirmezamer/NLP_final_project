If that's the case what makes Exorcists any different than Sinners, who would ALSO survive said decapitation, unless that wood axe was made of angelic steel?\n\nAnd if there's no difference between Exorcists and Sinners, then why were Exorcists so feared?\n\n\n\nI think the more likely case  is that anything that an angel is using as a weapon in turn, counts as angelic for purposes of harming other angels. Sinners, who aren't angels, have to just make do with weapons that are already angelic in nature, since they don't have any divinity to imbue into whatever they're hitting Exorcists with.",

I expect she will replace it was a weaponized prosthetic. Or it was simply an artistic choice of the creator of the show.",

They can circumvent this by using angelic weapons, on the premise that angels can hurt angels, which is what happens here.\n\nUndeniably, the show itself doesn't provide enough lore to explain this scene, but there are theories that can be made.",

            "yeah I can understand the frustration. sure it's stated to be one of the things capable of killing an angel, but like... you don't necessarily need to kill an angel if you can non lethal beat the shit out of them. just get enough people with bats, and eventually the cost of healing their exterminators will outweigh the killing of sinners.",
            "If I slam my toe in to the corner of my desk after grabbing snacks while hanging out with a friend and drop it, it\u2019s gonna hurt, but I will not instantly parish like I\u2019m noclipping into hell",

            "Similar issue to the table. They flew into it full force, the shield didn't break because Alastor is literally HIM, so they had to deal with the force they themselves generated. Lute RIPPED Vaggie's wings out, Angels are absolutely capable of harming eachother with their bare hands so it makes sense they can fly with enough force that they'd hurt themselves if they crashed into something they couldn't break through.",
            "what the fuck",
            "Yeaah that makes sense. I just thought since they didnt think they could even be damaged much less killed but yea. I dont always think things through",

            "If you threw it at an Egyptian god they\u2019d make your food turn to sand after ripping you balls off or something",
            "Well when you make a deal with a dick like Adam and Sarah to leave Charlie and devil born alone only sinners are fair game you need something to leverage the deal like mutually assured destruction.",
            "You\u2019re just jumping through hoops. Adam explicitly says \u201cThat\u2019s how they can *kill* us? With our own weapons?!\u201d he doesn\u2019t say \u2018harm\u2019, so it makes sense to assume they can still be harmed through normal means.\u00a0",
            "So, this is just a show having action and doesn't need lore, but...\n\nYou're cooking a really good 'curse' here.\n\nI might introduce demigods into my DnD campaigns, that people fight against by using spiky shields, trying to trick them into impaling themselves.",
            "Na, it's all assumptions, so no real way to know for sure :)",
            "I think Viv said it plus in the show Val ripped one of velvet\u2019s models apart and she put herself back together",

            "Oh I dont have the patience to search it then she say so manny things in so many tweets and videos. But velvette model is not an angel so I don\u2019t think the point stand idk the angels were told to be invulnerable to everything except angelic weapon.",
            "**SHUT UP, CURSE OF RA!**",

Plus, Adam reacted in pain when he was punched by Alastor\u2019s minion, Charlie throwing fucking *glitter* at one caused them to stop fighting and several angels flew away after Charlie shot fireworks at them because they didn\u2019t want to be hurt.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s also just a dumb distinction to make anyway. If Charlie hit Lute with a baseball bat she\u2019d be just fine, but if Vaggie does it then suddenly she actually gets hurt?\u00a0",
            "Just want to point out that Charlie's glitter might be angelic in nature considering that she's the daughter of Lucifer. Her magic probably has the same power to permanently kill sinners and angels as Adam's lasers.",

I say alledgedly because it could be a folk tale to drum up fear of him.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, vivz has stated and released side material showing him to have a sort of base code. I don't like to call it a moral code, but yes.\u00a0\n\n\nSo it's possible that all the overlords alastor tortured were...very bad people.\u00a0\n\n\nNow for the people under him: Alastor treats Niffty like a daughter, and he was pretty fine with husk most times\u00a0\n\n\nHusk outright said to folks, with alastor nearby he was forced to be there and alastor did nothing. He even offered husk a bribe to work even though he could've just threatened him\n\n\nHe still threatened husk with grievous harm though. That's not okay. But it wasn't at random, but when threatened. Not that that makes it okay... but it's better than Val\n\n\nVal is shown to be worse to be people overall. He killed an innocent person to blow off steam, he sexualy and physical abuses people for the fun of it and on the regular\n\n\nSo, underling wise: you have a guy that will sexually and physically abuse you at any moment, and a lot...versus a guy that won't do anything to you as long as you don't try threatening him\n\n\nThetes no contest here: Alastor is the better boss. Not a good one, but certainly the better choice between him and Val\n\n\nHowever, non boss wise. Alastor is more dangerous as an enemy than Val",

What we've heard about Alastor is menacing, but 1) it's in the past and 2) The worst he's done is spook Husk a little??\n\nName ONE non-icky thing Valentino did. Valentino has sexually, physically, and emotionally abused an on-screen character, and hasn't once shown support for our main protagonists. I will die on the hill that trying to say Alastor is just as bad as Val is a straight up strawman argument.",

He using sadism to force people to do what he wants and control them. And then there is the question of scale. Val is very individual focused. His harm and destruction happens at a one to one level. Alastor destroys on a larger scale. Val in the end is really just the evil of the mundane. You can find his form of evil in any suitably large city. He is an evil you could run into in real life. Alastor is a purity distillation of the worst the DSM V has to offer. He is likely neurologically incapable of empathy for anyone else. And is the closest we really come to true Evil in humanity. But even such people are not entirely beyond hope. They can find their way to a semblance of humanity. Even if they have to fake things like empathy. As long as they feel attached to someone or something they can try to play the part of a good person.",

He tortures, kills, and eats people because he genuinely enjoys it.\n\nOn top of the fact that I think he will be the series\u2019 big bad.

It's been a bit since I've re-watched but from what I remember it feels like we spend more time viewing the direct fallout of Valentino's actions, whereas for Alastor, other than the hallway scene with Husk, many of Alastor's worst actions are only described to us through a story told by another character. \n\nWe see both Valentino and Alastor kill people in hell, and it's implied they've both killed plenty of people prior to the events in the show. However, when we see Alastor kill in the show, it is usually in defense of someone/the hotel (as in the case of the loan sharks coming after Mimzy), whereas when we see Valentino kill it is usually purely out of anger (as in the case of Velvette's assistant).\n\nWe also see within the show that Alastor is (or at least appears to be) capable of forming positive relationships with other characters, as we see in his interactions with Mimzy, Nifty, and Rosie. Especially evident in his interactions with Rosie, Alastor (again, at least appears to be) capable of having a positive relationship with someone without any outwardly apparent ulterior motives. Valentino on the other hand, has very little positive to say, even with Velvette and Vox whom he's supposed to be closest. \n\nAll this is definitely not to say Alastor is good or even Less Bad than Valentino, just that at this point in the show I feel we are supposed to root for Alastor over Valentino. I would not be surprised if as the show progresses, this dynamic may change, especially if we see these characters' back stories of who they were before hell, and we have on-screen canon confirmation of Alastor being a serial killer while alive.\n\nRegardless of all this, I feel like people are more likely to lean towards Valentino being worse than Alastor, just due to the fact that his on-screen actions feel more Real and something many viewers may have had experience with. More people will have experienced sexual abuse than experienced an encounter with a serial killer. Alastor turning into a big scary monster and killing people feels more like fiction and abstract than the dressing room scene between Valentino and Angel Dust.",

As for a deal, you have to provoke him to get on his bad side usually. Try to be polite and don\u2019t bother him. Or die again if you must. \n\nAlso at least Alaster doesn\u2019t waste!

            "I think this is an interesting question because I believe the answer varies depending on the qualifier: who is worse according to what the show wants is to believe or according to what we personally believe?\n\nI think the show wants us to believe Val is the bad guy. He\u2019s the character we\u2019re meant to hate.\n\nI think the show wants us to be unsure of Alastor but associate him with the good guys and like him by extension.\n\nHowever personal beliefs can differ depending on what context and motives you believe.\n\nWe know literally nothing about Val\u2019s background. In the show, we see him being abusive and manipulative in many capacities toward a character we\u2019re meant to root for. We have zero context for a potential motive and he appears to enjoy it. Personally I think he\u2019s a bad guy with funny moments (see: the kiss in the finale).\n\nWhat we know of Alastor\u2019s background is literally labeled as a sort of folk tale. Mimzy starts the retelling with \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the stories\u201d and ends it with \u201cThat\u2019s the story most people know\u201d. Then she never substitutes any additional information regarding his background, just that he\u2019s not bad underneath. So I personally don\u2019t put much weight on the story since we don\u2019t know nor has it been verified in any way.\n\nLike Val, we see Alastor being abusive, manipulative and worse on screen. However, in some cases Alastor has a motive that makes it seem not as bad on the surface (protecting the hotel/his buddies) but the man is always up to something so it\u2019s hard to pin his true motive (maybe he was just trying to look good for Charlie). I see Alastor as a bad guy but one I\u2019m very interested in getting more info about.\n\nTo me both Val and Alastor have no real background and both have the capacity for manipulation and abuse. Val just goes for the trifecta of physical, emotional and sexual where Alastor doesn\u2019t go the sexual route but does murder and cannibalize. At the end of the day it\u2019s pointless to debate which crime is worse since they\u2019ve both abhorrent. So I think they\u2019re both well designed and acted bad guys in two different ways.",

Even his contract with Angel isn't as strong as Alastor's contracts (Val can't force Angel to live with him nor can he summon Angel like Alastor can with Husk and Nifty).\n\nIf Alastor had stuck with the Vees, they'd actually be ruling Hell.",

Like he threatens Husk, but that's it, as soon as it's clear he's back under his thumb he's jovial again. It's THAT easy to make his place known.\n\nVal on the other hand is more actively abusive, but I feel that is as much because he CAN'T control to the same extreme levels as Alastor, his contract only gives him full power in his studio, which causes more frustrations and flaunts of power from him. He needs to break his staff to keep them under his thumb, while Alastor only has to do so much as a jumpscare.",

Valentino kills Velvette's employee on an emotion fueled rampage, and then Vox has to explain why showing up at the hotel on a whim is a bad idea, implying that he isn't thinking everything through. On the other hand, machiavellians have good impulse control, long term planning skills, and are practically defined by their expertise in manipulation. \n\nValentino kills, abuses, and manipulates because it makes him powerful right then and there. Alastor kills, abuses, and manipulates when the consequences benefit his goals, and refrains when it would damage his reputation.\n\n\n\nAlso, just a quick side note, but I just want to emphasize that characters are not real people and we can't diagnose them. ASPD is a disorder whereas psychopathy is a list of traits, and not everyone with ASPD is a psychopath + not all psychopaths have ASPD.

I actually thought for a while that Viv read up on the Dark Triad/Tetrad and decided to give Alastor all of their traits. So for me it has been a guessing game as to how well read Viv is on matters of psychology. I figure she has to be somewhat familiar as the plot of both series seems to circle around the mental well being of the characters and she does a fairly good workup of how such individuals will behave. \n\nAnd I used to apply the older terms as well but I got ridden hard by someone claiming that I clearly did not know what I was talking about due to using antiquated terms.

Twice.\n\nIn the official comics, he's shown as trying to interact with random people, even though everyone is scared of him. Cannibals are the only exception, which is why he has a courteous attitude towards them. At the end of the comic, he kills a butcher for trying to trick an innocent demon into becoming the next set of meat parts for his stall.\n\nSo there's no proof that he kills innocents, and an indication that he doesn't in the comics. He seems to get his kicks out of being the biggest bastard around, so he kills and tortures powerful people in order to make himself look more powerful than they are. By coincidence, it means he has no reason to kill random people off the street. That would just get his clothes dirty.\n\nThis is compared to Valentino, who enslaves and exploits any demon sexy enough to peddle in a smut video.",

It seems like Valentino and Alastor are being set up as a challenge for Charlie to grapple with in terms of her views surrounding redemption, and I feel like that conflict is integral enough that both characters' nuances will be handled carefully.\n\nRegarding the terminology, that's totally understandable, and I appreciate you putting both terms in the original post for clarity.

People like husk, can't handle nuance or shades or grey. So they see the current husk being nice and assume he must have always been a model citizen with no sins of his own, just gambling addiction\u00a0\n\n\nSo alastor is the big awful meanie that took over their poor little precious uwu husky. They don't want to accept that Husk as an overlord did the same, and comitted other crimes. Or accept that husk had it coming, or that if not alastor, he'd have gone and sold his soul to someone else who could have been just as bad or worse\n\n\n\n\nBut Angel Dust literally atleast sold his body and evennhis soul to assure his sister's safety, you'll be surprised how different Walter White in SS3-5 and him in ss5 finale are, Husk maybe not that evil but that's how much it drastically changed him to ponder his life.",

What we saw in both of these flashbacks was literally him killing innocents. The comic you are referring to is no longer canon and viv doesn\u2019t stand by it anymore and even if it was. Alastor left the woman there crying, bleeding and traumatized while laughing. It was exactly to depict his canon hypocricy. It wasn\u2019t saving far far from it. Alastors whole character and reputation if about getting his clothes dirty it was stated his broadcast was a daily thing with ur logic there wouldn\u2019t be overlord left in hell. There is direct proof he kills innocents which i already mentioned, you leave the major parts for no reason. \nAlastor literally has innocent people in his ownership that he abuses for his own enjoyment how is that any different from what Valentino does? The context is what ur missing here. Ofc he didn\u2019t kill Sir Pentious how do you expect Charlie to trust him then and his manipualtion to work in the first place? He\u2019s restrained from his deal from many things. I feel like you need to rewatch the show and the pilot since it was stated and shown him killing innocent people there just like the lamb in the comic itself, also feel like you need to reread it and actually get the point of what was shown there since that on it\u2019s own proves my point.\nThe entire point of alastors character is that he tortures and murders people for fun. Him killing \u201cinnocent\u201d sinners was terror the hell siffered him killing the more powerful figures was shocking. There is canon evidence of alastor killing innocents and not caring who he kills at all that was like the majority of what we saw from him. I feel like ur missing things out and take them out of context on purpose to make him seem better than Val even though that\u2019s not the case at all. What i said was lready mentioned here multiple times",
            "If you want to talk about the official no longer canon comic he literally attacks multiple innocent people there in adding to my point. The comic proves he kills and attacks innocents and so does the show. You ignoring him abusing those he owns, the fact both vaggie and mimzy shown and mentioned his murders in hell and tortures of regular people. All proof and evidence of him killing innocents it\u2019s literally one of the major points of his character and why he\u2019s feared by regular people so much. I think you need to give the show a rewatch with actually paying attention same if you want to refer to no longer relevant comic where you also ignore things. He exploits, abuses and takes advantage of innocent people just as much as val thats why the show compares them so much",

Was just pointing out that it\u2019s not like Val is limited to sexual abuse and we have evidence of it.\n\nWhat exactly are the rules behind the getting better? Because Velvette says it with that one sinner but the exterminations means they do die again but does it mean just to angelic weapons? I\u2019ve been confused on that point.",
            "I'm confused about Lucifer. He said that Charlie could count on him for anything, that he was at least willing to help her material wise when it came to the Hotel.

It sounds kinda weird.\n\nSecond of all, he literally says in a private conversation with Niffty that he finds them enjoyable to be around and states \u201cI admit, one could get accustomed\u201d, which is basically another way of saying \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m starting to like it here.\u201d A good part of it is him being manipulative but he does show signs of genuinely enjoying the others\u2019 companionship and wanting to change for the better.

Actually what are you trying to argue for. That alastor is a bad person? Yah I know that. The at he\u2019s word then Val? The twos crimes aren\u2019t really comparable. That what he does to husk is bad? Yes I know. What are you saying?\u00a0",
            "I get the impression Viv has already set Alastor's path. I think narratively has already lost his fight against Charlie. He is going to break free of the contract and take the true villains path. But he is going to find that he is already attached to Charlie. And thus when he has to confront her in a fight he is going to find he cannot end her as he would prefer a world with Charlie in it than not. Not true empathy. But he is going to realize things were better with her. And thus he is going to go the Anakin route and turn his back on whatever powers may be standing before Charlie in the end. He will find his way back to the Hotel but due to his lack of true empathy he will not be a good fit for Heaven and will find his place is remaining with Charlie and Vaggie at the Hotel probably with Niffty in tow. Her diagnosis seems to be a whole different mix and not easily resolved. So she will probably prefer to stay with Alastor anyways. And the people at the Hotel like her. Just some guess work based on the narrative so far.",

            "No reason? He shows up at the Hotel the moment after Charlie gets off the phone crying to her mother. He pledges himself to help the Hotel and does not go around trying to trip people up. Despite his obvious draw towards sadism. He had ample opportunity to trip up both Angeldust and Sir Pentious. If fact he had motivation to destroy Sir Pentious and pulled his punches every time. He spent 7 years not attacking anyone (per Mimzy). As if he had been put on standby with orders not to hurt anyone without direct orders to do so. The evidence is strong that it is Lilith that has his contract and was initially using him to take out the more problematic Overlords that were opposing her attempt to unify the sinners. And once she got taken to Heaven she put him on lockdown until she heard that Charlie had the Hotel up and running and was bringing the attention of Heaven and the Overlords again. So she sent him to protect her and the Hotel. Seems like plenty of reason to me.",

That's when Alastor revealed himself as the Radio Demon, and anyone that would mess with him... *laughs* Well, let's just say, his broadcasts never lacked new voices.\n\nthe images accompanying this are:\n\nSinners scared and cornered in an alley. This at the exact moment mimzy states overlords are going missing, so media literacy dictates this is an overlord and not a random weak lil sinner. \n\nNext scene is images of sinners fading, again while the narration is about heavy hitters overlords missing. So media literacy means understanding these sinners are also overlords \n\nNext scene is random sinners on the street listening to radio broadcast and looking surprised\n\nNext image us the radio coming closer\n\nThen alastor with his minions\n\nThe end\n\nThe only scene of a scared sinner is the one right as mimzy is talking about overlords. Had you had any of the media literacy you brought up, you'd realize this means this scared sinner is a powerful overlord and not some poor innocent weak nobody",
            "Fair, though I feel like an ancient horror would have a stronger effect than some serial killer, it's like comparing Jeffrey dahmer to Chuthulu, granted that was my personal opinion from the scene so you could be right, I just feel like Zestial would be more feared than Alastor",
            "No no, it\u2019s ok.\n\nAlso you can\u2019t deny that he does show signs of enjoying being around the others for non-nefarious reasons. He is mostly manipulative, but he does genuinely seem to show some signs of being a good person deep down. Perhaps it\u2019s Charlie rubbing off on him but the signs are there, season 2 may show them more prominently. Who knows? We can\u2019t make a conclusive judgement yet.",
            "That was the point about the discussion between Alastor and Niffty in the finale. He mentions that one could almost get attached to such things. Only to have him rage out after he loses to Adam of how he had almost fallen into it. His comment about altruism was him raging at himself for letting himself get attached. He was starting to help Charlie without the contract directing his actions. It was his desire to be of service to Charlie that caused him to go to battle against Adam  and nearly die. He was raging that he was losing his sense of who he was and what his goals were. But even with his rebuking himself the fact remains that Charlie got into his head. He will run on rage struggling against the contract for the next season and finally bust out and go full villain. But Viv is foreshadowing that he has already lost to Charlie. He will not be able to destroy her.",
            "He doesn't even know what he wants to do with the favor yet. It was an opportunistic moment he grasped. Combined with the tasty tasty suffering. It is a better fit to his personality. I think people have too much of a Dexter motif associated with Alastor. I think Viv means for him to be a chained monster. The narrative tension building based on his desire to break his chains. \n\nAnd when we consider that we have two characters around Charlie who are desperate to break their contracts and their stories are hinged on the contracts needing to be broken she seems to be the fulcrum which will be breaking those contracts. I think in S2 Charlie is going to either find that one of her abilities is to be able to break contracts or she is going to find a way to do so. She will do this to save Angeldust. But Alastor will play the favor to break his. Sending him on his true villain arc.",
            "Thats my thinking. I think a lot of people want their dommy mommy Lilith and want her to be all domineering. That just doesn't jive with how Charlie turned out. Lucifer was out of the picture and Lilith was raising her alone. She learned compassion for the sinners from someone and it sure and Hell wasn't from Lucifer. I think Viv is playing games with the audience in how she presents Lilith. Visually she presents her as sinister and ominous. But the verbal connotations we get from Charlie is that she is a kind and loving person who kept Lucifer's hopes and dreams alive and strove to unite the sinners. Charlie even claims that she wants her mother to see how the Hotel turned out because she was doing it as a continuation of what Lilith had been trying to do.",
            "\"Yall couldn't handle Alastor\"\n\n\"Hey Husk and Angel situations are different actually\"\n\n\"YOU ARE DISGUSTING\" like... Calm down, It's not CoD matches with N-words spam, Please provide argument, I will listen to you.",
            "you told them to stop \u201cspamming\u201d but you\u2019ve posted far more comments than they have. that\u2019s all i\u2019m saying. you might be getting too heated over this.",
            "No they aren\u2019t",
            "Alastor wouldn't Blink before killing a weak demon if he needed do it, he's not some virtuous guy, just old fashioned",
            "All of us provided the same argument destroying yours like 5 times you still spam the same nonsense. No thanks bro",
            "cause you said so lol bro why am I even wasting my times on such a child",
            "Mimzy bringing trouble right to them clearly wasn't enough for him to kill her. It would make sense for him to kill her if all she does is bring her problems to him.\n\nI'd say either they must have done more than just try to kill him (or Sir Pentious would have been dead), or possibly whoever owns his soul needs him to kill certain people. I guess the person who owns his soul could be weaker than him, but owning Alastor makes them untouchable.",
            ">And, yes, saying Husk had it coming means that you are justifying Alastor\n\n\"If you said US are badguy, you are with 9/11 bomber\" ah argument.\n\nUnless both \"were\" kinda shit (still Alastor is basically Hannibal with Magical Shit), but that's what the name \"Husk\" implied, just a shell of his former. It's not the same guy in the past anymore. That's why I love it\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nI was abused by my narcissistic dad, Physical an Mentally, for 2 years not to mention the cold turkey he forced me to go though the ADHD, but I would always choose this over getting \ud83c\udf47 multiple like Angel Dust does.",
            "Mimzy was his friend BEFORE both got in Hell, obviously he have consideration for her, DOESN'T means he could not make her an example if needed, y'all are trying really hard to find reasons for a guy that did literally say he wouldn't sacrifice himself for others\n\nAlastor DON'T have any interest in protecting others, he himself exploit as much of the system by owing souls (that no, we don't in fact know if it's only overlords) and feeling pleasure in torturing them, he's a psychopath for a reason and don't matter the fake code he makes for himself, in the end he enjoy violence as much as Val (even if it's a different type of violence)\n\nYou can like horrible characters, they're fucking FICTIONAL, you're NOT a bad person for liking an immoral character",
            "Bro no way ur comparing a real life tragedy to abuser and victim?? yeah saying abuse victim had it coming is justifying alastor, it is sick and fucked up and ur double standard hypocricy doesn\u2019t help it in any way"
