            ">The seeds may look insignificant, but RnD are besides themselves with excitement. In their words, the Morkite Seeds could be potential stepping stones towards potential cultivation of Morkite off-site.\n\nWait, so they make us work on making ourselves obsolete ?\n\nWAIT FOR THE UNION TO HEAR ABOUT THIS !",
            "Trying out the new OCs as I get them, and so far *really* enjoying cluster charge hurricane.\n\nBasically turns each and every shot into a cluster grenade *and* if you want you can just ram the entire missile into enemies for nice single target damage.\n\nMust say though most looking forwards to mortar rounds because I saw someone use it and it looked like it'll be real fun.",

            "This is by far the best season yet. Great mission, great random event, overall good new modifiers and enemies, good QoL all around. Still hoping one day they add the option to mute the game when tabbed.",
            "A banana and some mixed veggies. Gotta give myself a good boost for a day in the mines",
            "Season 5 goes hard, feel free to play it",
            "I was with a group earlier & we found a jetboot crate on a drillevator mission. Unfortunately when it came time to head out, we couldn't equip the jetboot v2s to escape & almost wiped. Was there something I missed?",
            "The new mission is crazy fun! \n\nalways singing \"it raining bugs, Hallelujah!\" on the way down",
            "*sad console noises*",
            "I don't like the new missions - at all...\n\nSearching for the resonance geodes is annoying. It promotes soloing.\n\nShooting up while digging down is annoying due to the clutter of the dead bugs falling down.\n\nThe geode room is beautiful and the boost up is fun.\n\nBu then you have to wait an eternity until molly is back at the escape.\n\nUgh....",
            "In my first deep scan mission, moments after activating the drillevator we got two bulk detonators. Killing them before they reached us wasn't too much of a problem, but when they exploded they rained bomblets down on us which killed three. I only survived because I was under the gunner shield *and* had max health, and I still nearly died.\n\nBulks seem pretty hard to deal with when you can't get any horizontal distance from their explosion.",
            "Haven't had a chance to try it out yet, nor anytime soon, so I've got a question. How does Engi's turrets interact with the drillevator? I'm trying to avoid youtube because I want to go in blind. Thanks.",
            "The \"select random mission\" button should give a bonus XP/materials.\n\nAlso, joining a random in-progress mission would be cool too, though you'd have to specify your preferred ping threshold.",
            "Anyone else feel that the drillevator is a bit too small and cramped?",
            "I won't get to join you lot, for another week or so, (military duties must be tended to) but I am so ready to dive into the deep down dark deep again.\n\nRock and stone brothers.",
            "Made myself a really nice sandwich this morning",
            "Looks like Mission Control is back to repeating voicelines. Was doing the dive and he kept telling us to connect the pipeline to the pumpjack even as we were escaping",
            "The new status effect overlays are annoying af. I can't see anything during swarms compared to pre-s5.",
            "Dont' know if this is the right thread but can you make the Burst Fire overclock for GK2 as a holdable action rather than me having to spam click left button to shoot?\n\nBasically I thought that holding the left button would make burst shots rather than having to click it.",
            "For some reason I'm having the opposite problem I had last season when it comes to the seasonal event.\n\nIn S3 and S4 it seemed like I could never get a mission without a meteor event, whereas in S5 I can't find any Corestones lol. Not complaining, I guess my luck is just odd",
            "Had a breakfast burrito and a banana and nutella smoothie",
            "Not a single change to any weapon, perk or OC? At all? None? Zero? Zilch? Nada?",
            "Am I missing something or should I have microconductor add-on in my forge? Turret Arc is gone from my forge, it\u2019s not in my overclocks, and it hasn\u2019t been refunded for a blank core nor upgraded.",
            "What happened to the scale brigade weapon paint job? Unequipped it by accident and noticed it is completely gone after trying to put it on again.",
            "Played 2 rounds of the new mode. \n\nRound 1: failed due to player error before reaching the drillevator, nothing to write home about.\n\nRound 2: Host crashed to desktop about 15-20 seconds into the drillevator.\n\nNot the greatest first impression though obviously I haven't played it much. The first phase seems a bit tedious trying to track down the sensor chunks or whatever, lots of random mining trying to find the proverbial needle in a haystack. Unless I'm missing something to that, it'd be nice if there was some surface tell so you knew where to dig once finding the general area.",
            "You guys should make a sticky for the oblivious console players who can't read deep enough to know the season isn't out for them yet.",
            "2 weeks till it hits consoles. Hopefully.",
            "Excited to return to the game this weekend. Only played for a while during Season 2 and for some reason never returned despited thinking about it all the time.\n\nCouldn\u2019t play today but went on the steam app and bought the second Support pack plus 6 other pieces of DLC on discount today (around \u20ac20 total for so much DLC) to support the devs because they\u2019re so freaking generous with all the free content to unlock by just playing the game. Rock and Stone!",
            "Was there a second stubby overclock in this update? I\u2019ve ran out of weapon overclocks a while ago, but randomly got two in a row tonight.",
            "I love the new OC, thanks for making it!",
            "Almost-burnt toast",
            "It's been pretty broken for me\n\n  \nOf course I disabled all my mods and add them back one by one in order to figure which one's got issue\n\n  \nOnly to crash again after I removed the mod that I thought was the problem",
            "Anyone else think the rifts resemble the terrain around error cubes? Like the cubes are going to finally be realized as pieces from of the core / deepest parts of Hoxxes?\n\nI posted screenshots here to compare: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/1dfhlg0/error\\_cube\\_origin\\_revealed\\_next\\_season/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/1dfhlg0/error_cube_origin_revealed_next_season/)",
            "I love the new mission type. but really, WHAT IN KARLS NAME IS MORKITE!\n\nWhat is it used for? It can be found in blue/teal crystal clusters or a black liquid, and now comes from a seed in a bright green crystal nodule inside a geode? If an Ommoran is \"alive\" could Morkite be another crystalline entity? \"Living\" core core found inside a generally spherical geode. ITS POSSABLE!!",
            "What weapon is that burst fire rifle shown in the trailer?",
            "Is the assignment for drillevator never ending? Like you get 5 new missions or something? Sorry new to the game.",
            "Are we getting luckier or did Phazyonite spawns get boosted. Weve had phazy spawn in 6 of our last 8 missions, way more common than we used to find it.",
            "I had to repurchase my cryo cannon 4B mod, supercooling mixture. anybody else lose any modifications they had to repurchase with the update?",
            "I had all the new weapon skins (bubblegum, buff, flaming hot) ready at the forge instantly.\n\nAnyone else?",
            "When did the Ommoran Heartstone get a new final phase? That rock prison attack caught me off guard",
            "What\u2019s coming out with the new season? I haven\u2019t seen anything about this. \nI\u2019m at work rn and can\u2019t look it up",
            "Regarding the Mark II jet boots; am I missing something?  It seemed like you don\u2019t get enough juice to get all the way out of the hole!\nMaybe I just need to do the missions a few more times to see if that was a random variable\u2026",
            "We finally have thug shaker central",
            "I mean. That\u2019s awesome for steam players, but feels super disappointing after seeing the only date listed as today, and I\u2019ve gotta wait till 6/27 to play with friends and see the update. \n\nFeels like a massive letdown on an already rough day.",
            "Well not for us console players hmph!",
            "I don't know if its a bug or not but the welding visor got moved out of my inventory into the season pass, was that intentional?",
            "No it\u2019s not, I\u2019m on x box",

            "This must be how they are setting up the plot of Rogue Core. Morkite seeds and void monsters will go berserk and threaten to destroy the mining operation.",
            "wait, you guys have unions?",
            "I feel like drg would have learned from the past 4 season but no this will lead to them having to fix a problem",
            "Is it difficult to get used to the mechanic? I am definitely looking forward to trying cluster charge but looks like it would take some adjusting to get used to it",
            "The new pump action feels fantastic.",
            "Mortar is super hard to aim - looking up and away from your targets makes it a real challenge. But the damage output is *brutal*.",
            "mortar rounds are a chef kiss",
            "do i have to deal with randomly getting the new OCs from machine events and promotions? i really want the one for the hurricane but i dont want to have to grind a hundred hours to get it",
            "I'm from the future. The entire online community is now Gunners blasting Mortar Rounds at their teammates whilst spamming 'I know the way!' over and over again.\n\n\nThere is no escape from this Hell.",

            "That\u2019s a bug!",
            "Had a go at the new mission with the new modifier. It was raining a whole lotta bugs and Red Sugar lol",
            "2 weeks is good. I\u2019ve been waiting for the Stardew console update for nearly 3 months now after patch 1.6 release..",
            "Yeah, it's a bummer. But Helldivers 2 got its major patch today, and a new warbond, so that's keeping my attention for a while.",
            "Good thing you weren\u2019t a risk of rain fan when survivors of the void came out",
            "I found the resonance geodes annoying too, but the rest, and final moments of the run is a entirely new feeling.\n\nIt\u2019s fun to have all the bugs falling down and more coming.\n\nThe geode room has nothing to offer, so I found it to be quite boring, a new kind of boss at the end would be funnier.\n\nAnd waiting for molly is kinda like the rest of the drillevator, survive while holding your ground, so I really liked that part, since usually is run as fast as you can to the drop pod and that's it.\n\nOverall, I liked it because It\u2019s a new kind of mission with a new kind of felling to play with, however It\u2019s a chore due to the geodes and so, isn't my favorite to do.",
            "They descend with it! Their electric arc on the other hand does not...",
            "Not when you're looking up and shooting, since the tightness allows you to target bugs on all sides\n\nBut when you look down, especially with 4 people, it does feel way too small",
            "I feel like the bit before the drillevator is extremely boring. Especially the fact that the satellite thingies drop so close to the gems. I finished 4 deep scans so far and in those for scans, literally every time we had to connect the satellite to the gem with the wire, we did it with placing just one wire node thing",
            "This is huge news - deserves its own sticky.",
            "Hmm, mission control seems to have had too many beers.",
            "It's been changed to Microconductor. It does more now.",
            "I mean it literally shows you are you higher, lower or on the same level as the gem and it shows you the distance to it in meters\n\nOnly way it could be even easier is if they made them appear on the scanner",
            "The sound effect it emits kicks in when you're almost on top of it.",
            "Rock and roll and stone!",
            "the turret arc got reworked into a new one, so if you have that one, it\u2019ll get replaced. \n\nhowever, there\u2019s a bug where the game thinks you don\u2019t have it and you can \u201cfind it again\u201d, assuming you found turret arc OC before season 5",
            "Are any of the mods even updated for the season yet? \n\nSurely just play without all of them for now",
            "Scout\u2019s Deepcore GK2 assault rifle",
            "Intended behavior, you got the cost of those upgrades refunded.",
            "It doesn't have enough juice indeed. However the CD is very fast, u can boost again right before u start free falling.",
            "Don't use up the charge, it'll refill *fast*, then burst again, just don't overfly the drop pod tunnel level (and be prepared to wait for Molly).",
            "Every update, no matter the size, has been like this since the beginning. Touch grass.",
            "It is a different head piece that is the welding visor with hair in the back. (original makes you bald)",
            "Bro this isn't a DM lol",
            "We're \n\nWe're harvesting plants? Not-beer plants?\n\nDEEP SCAN IS FARMING?!?",
            "Always have been",
            "It does no friendly fire so it's nearly impossible to fuck up. For some reason you can't manually reload your secondary while using it, and I desperately wish you could bind \"OC-specific weapon action\" to a button OTHER than reload, but once you learn to hold it down instead of tapping it, it works fine.",
            "It completely stuns and kills everything even if you aren\u2019t using it correctly. It\u2019s insanely overtuned lol, no adjustment required",
            "Trying to get the missiles to pop where you want can take a bit of trial and error, especially against airborne targets, but overall not too difficult I would say.\n\nYou just need to remember that tapping r reloads and holding r pops the missiles. You can kinda get that mixed up a bit at the start.",
            "I recommend making your rockets fly faster cause the momentum from the rocket will carry the bombs forward instead of scattering it around. It makes using oc much easier but the hold r to trigger it is still kinda clunky.",
            "And Deep dives/weekly core hunts but yeah there is no non-rng way to obtain OCs.",
            "Stone!",
            "Roll",

            "Fruit is the meat of the plant!",
            "Good to know, thanks!! Everything else is rock & roll, great work with the new season!!",
            "Speaking of bugs, when you temporarily desync *just* short enough to not get autokicked - e.g. due to lag spikes - the client usually doesn't update the terrain that got destroyed in the meantime.\n\nThis usually isn't a problem, since the terrain still ends up intangible and you can just pass through, but for whatever reason, desyncing in the Drillevator makes your jet boots treat the remaining bit of terrain as solid, and they automatically turned themselves off (or refused to thrust?) upon hitting the non-existent \"ceiling\".\n\nI ended up having to dig a path around the ~2m of rock, but that wasn't too fun, and I'd bet not intended either.",
            "Still waiting for signalis update here.",
            "Yeah until you realize by console he meant Xbox.\n\nI am in the same boat and it\u2019s too bad because I would love to play helldivers",
            "Good lord\u2026those were some dark times.",
            "I'm kinda sick of boss-focused missions tbh, this game is at its best when it focuses on exploration and utilizing the terrain generation system to its fullest, so I'm glad this new mission focuses on that",
            ">They descend with it!\n\nHuzzah!\n\n>Their electric arc on the other hand does not...\n\nInteresting. Sounds great for some shenanigans.",
            "But finding them is the annoying part...",
            "I still don\u2019t have microcunductor add-on though. It wasn\u2019t in my forge, and it wasn\u2019t automatically crafted. It wasn\u2019t changed, it just isn\u2019t there anymore, period.",
            "I didn't pick up on that, thank you for sharing!",
            "I'm not suggesting there isn't a learning curve that I haven't cracked yet however you haven't pointed out anything I didn't already know.\n\nYes, it displays whether it's higher/lower/level, that's not so much the issue. Personally though I find the distance gauge to be frustratingly imprecise and difficult to read. If there's an audio cue that's more distinct, I haven't noticed it over the other noises going on. \n\nFurthermore, what are the rules of the spawn? This is probably the most important part but is it always accessible from the open floor? How deep is it? I've been what I thought was right on top of it but I ended up digging all the way around it without realizing because there's no visual cue that indicates you're in the general area.\n\nPoint here is, I've played video games before and this mechanic is nothing new. It's just difficult to zero in on the goal.",
            "Good bot.",
            "I joined drg like a month ago so not sure how they work\n\nBut I think most of my mods weren't updated for season 4 either and didn't have any problems",
            "oh, why?",
            "Thank you \ud83e\udd18",
            "Thank you \ud83e\udd18 it\u2019s actually super fun too",
            "I WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS HERESY",
            "> I desperately wish you could bind \"OC-specific weapon action\" to a button OTHER than reload\n\nCompletely agree with this... I understand why they did this because of consoles but I really don't liked the 'overloaded' use of the reload button.",
            "You can manually reload your secondary, it's just finicky because the game thinks you're trying to pop a missiles if you hold r for like more than .5 seconds or something.\n\nAnd yes OC ability trigger should totally not use 'hold down reload, as triggers.",
            "Ah ok thanks for insight\n\nLooking forward to trying it",
            "It does no friendly fire? This is outrageous. I will complain to management",

            "If you want friendly fire, the mortar rounds for the autocannon got both shares of it. Won't stop people from jumping into your firing line though.\n\nAlso, if you use bomblets on magma core you turn the mission into shield disruption.",

            "It didn\u2019t refund itself or give me a different oc instead, either. I don\u2019t even have the screenshots to file a bug report.",
            "I have a different oddity with microconductor. I had turret arc crafted before the patch, and now i have microconductor crafted and equipabble, but i also got it out of a core printer so its sitting ready to be crafted at the forge as well.",

            "I mean, it depends on what you like. Do you prefer first-person shooters or third-person? Both games focus on surviving, accomplishing a set of goals(both mandatory and optional), and then leaving the area, a wide array of weapons and equipment, scaling difficulties, etc. So they are similar, but it depends on what you enjoy. I will say HD2 is a bit harder than DRG, but only in that the automatons are a big difficulty spike. The bugs, while overwhelming at times, are quite squishy and easy to deal with, especially if you kite them around. Yes, some are heavily armored, but you have more than enough stratagems to deal with it. But the bots require tactics and good use of cover. They are the only enemy, as of right now, that shoot back. And they have a lot of firepower. \n\nOf course, that's another similarity. Both games feature bug enemies. The bugs in HD2 aren't like the glyphids, but they do share some traits. The bugs have various sizes, various abilities, etc. \n\nApologies for the wall of text. Honestly, I think that if you like DRG, you'll enjoy HD2. But look up some gameplay and see for yourself. It's a lot more action-packed, too. Especially on higher difficulties. While DRG has 5 biomes with different hazards and modifiers, HD2 has a number of biomes and modifiers unique to each faction, with more to be added as time goes on. \n\nSorry if that's a bit scattered, I'm a little busy ATM. But I think I've covered the basics.",

            "I assume there is a separate set of Deep Dives for consoles this week since the DLC has not yet launched there?",
            "Last mission of the EDD makes me wonder if they ever plan on letting Bosco help more on escort missions. My build was very kite-reliant (I mean I was a scout) and I went in blind, but ended up losing the dozer at about 70% through the Heartstone.  \n  \nFirst mission was pretty straight forward.  \nSecond has a dead end area where you'll need one of aquarqs from, but super simple if you have a driller. Soloing as a scout I had to rely heavily on Bosco. Getting one of these off the bat otherwise may be wise.  \nThird is not horrible up until the end, but is kind of a standard 1-stop escort mission with easy to reach shale. \n\n  \nTons of nitra I never got to in the 3rd stage.  \n  \nIn a normal group I don't see this being that bad, but if you're solo you'll definitely need to kill things asap. Again, a fairly typical haz 5+ escort...\n\nI don't like escort so am unlikely to try soloing again, but may end up joining a group of randoms at some point.",
            "This week's normal Deep Dive really loved ranged enemies, and missions that take a long time.\n\n* **First Stage** - Big nice open cave. Nothing too advanced. All three Mini-mules are fairly easy to reach, so is the Morkite Geyser. Plenty of Nitra thanks to the Mini-mules and a single leech in the roof. \n\n* **Second Stage** - So many ranged enemies, thanks to the new Duck and Cover warning. The mission itself otherwise ain't too much trouble, with the Morkite Geyser being in an in-between cave.\n\n* **Third Stage** - Duck and Cover makes it's foul return. The area around the Caretaker is spacious, so minimal terraforming is needed. The Twin's cocoon is right above said Caretaker. Plenty of Nitra available once more. \n\nI played Gunner together with an Engineer and Driller, on Steam.",
            "Failed the EDD on the first try with the dozer at 90% complete... It was sad. Two people in the group were clearly unaware of the new rock prison wave and how much damage it does to the dozer. Me and the other guy franticly typed in chat trying to get them to walk away from her, but she lost both her sides that wave.\n\n  \nPlease make sure your team knows the new rock mechanic in escort duty does A LOT OF DAMAGE to the dozer.",
            "For the last stage of the Deep Dive, do the data vault first. Once the data vault is defeated, immediately start the boss battle with the dreadnoughts. The explosion from the data vault should drain most of their health.\n\nOverall, a very fun, if hectic, deep dive.",
            "i've been waiting for this, thanks for the speedy heads up",
            "Never understood why people hated Duck and Cover so much until I played this one",
            "It's really satisfying to pop the egg right as caretaker is about to die, his death explosion kills the dreadnaughts for you.",
            "Interesting deep dive to get back into deep dives on\n\nStage 1 wasn't really memorable. As of writing this message I am currently on stage 2 with a Driller build that is very lacking in range. The bramble mortar guy over the oil refill zone is interesting. It's my first time seeing it and my first time playing duck and cover, seeing so many acid spitters at once was pretty new. I've been down a couple of times but Dotty is doing alright. Will write more when it's over one way or another.\n\nI broke through the Heartstone and then got sniped by four tri jaws at the same time and lost. RIP, was asking for it with a flamethrower and full auto subata build lol. No range at all\n\nEdit: came back later with Gunner and won, saw stage 3 is Industrial Sabotage with Duck and Cover, decided I'm good. A cosmetic OC isn't worth that lol. It'd probably be a beard anyway",
            "Could you describe the cave generations if you remember? I always check on here if I should be playing driller",
            "One more damn week!",
            "Yeah it's pretty clear that solo playing hasn't been tested much, Bosco has a lot of issues. People love to talk about how he's a \"perfect\" teammate but that's not the case at all. \n\nHe has terrible shooting because IIRC there's an internal cooldown or something, so he just can't handle high hazard swarms at all. That's fine on a lot of missions, but certain scenarios, like when you're refueling on escort and constantly dealing with ambient spawns, or when you get leeched/grabbed, it can become very frustrating, especially since it takes him a while to react to pings/calls. Rockets are a great example of this lol. \n\nHe can't really help with a lot of the secondary objectives. When I play solo and get fossils as a class that is not scout I just don't bother tbh.\n\nHe can't help with machine events, i.e. clearing a path for tritilye, helping with ebonite glyphids, etc.\n\nHe can't help with mobility in any way like another player could.\n\nHe couldn't focus on foaming/vacuuming in rockpox events and would not focus rockpox weakspots.\n\nYou can equip him with some CC (ice rockets) but it's more work to get him to use it than it is to just bring your own.\n\nThis will probably be a hot take, but he can't revive you infinite times like a player could. I've seen lots of EDD screenshots with 15+ deaths a person on this sub and the discord. But four deaths with Bosco and you're done. I don't see why he can't have infinite revives but with some sort of cooldown.\n\nDon't get me wrong he does a lot, and I've played a fair amount of solo missions, but it's pretty clear that they don't really test usage with him or they would have fixed his basic problems a while ago.",
            "What changed? I didn't see anything in the patch notes. Can you link me some explanation or guide?",
            "iirc there are two explosions, one the instant it dies, and one with the visual explosion after it falls over",
            "DD is pretty straightforward iirc, could probably run any class\n\nThe EDD has cramped caves especially the second level so driller recommended to clear out space for the black box etc or gunner for the force field if you\u2019re solo. Jet boots in the first level as well so mobility isn\u2019t as needed. And the third level isn\u2019t hard to navigate without boots/grapple hook",
            "It was a solid EDD to finish the season on. Challenging but fair.",
            "I failed my EDD while holding E on Doretta for around 15-20 seconds straight while trying to stay alive since I couldn't kill stuff beforehand fast enough (throwing nades and stuff too, but once the obelisks pop out + swarms...you're cooked.) You basically get stuck with no one to kill the bugs since Bosco can't repair, and his damage is...well, nice as support, but nowhere near yours. An extremely disappointing way to lose. (Edit: I only committed when I absolutely had to, otherwise I went back and forth between repairing/killing.)\n\nOverall, I understand that DRG isn't balanced for solo play, but they could at least make you repair quicker or let Bosco repair at 50% speed while solo. As it stands, Escort missions kill my enjoyment of the game, but it's probably never going to change due to the game being co-op focused.\n\nI enjoy co-op, I really do, but that doesn't mean solo escort missions should be this painful. I 'enjoy' difficulty where I lose to my own mistakes, not because all I could do was stare at an NPC and hold E.\n\nA lot of the stuff you listed is true, but since most are secondary missions I haven't let it affect me much. Escort, however, is a primary mission type and I'm starting to wonder if I want to play around it.\n\nWasn't expecting to go on a rant about this, but I found myself agreeing with you so went with it. :|\n\nEdit: I think infinite revives with Bosco would be too much though, since he can't go down. Adding a cooldown would just mean gg if you died two times too quickly, which is also different from co-op. I'm personally fine with the current limitations, as that's a part of the fun.\n\nFunnily enough, my loss had nothing to do with me dying. T\\_T",
            "new ommoron phase + random phase order",
            "So they randomized the order that the waves happen while you protect the dozer, that alone throws people off. For example no one expects the flying boulders at first.\n\nThe real issue is there is a new type of wave now with a brand new mechanic. A random player will start to see a ring of rocks around them, in 2-3 seconds they will get encased in a rock prison that they have to dig themselves out of.\n\nThe kicker is if you're next to the dozer and this happens it will damage her A TON. People that don't know this see her take damage, stand on top of her to fix it, and accidentally kill her because they don't realize what's doing the damage.\n\nTLDR: in the rock prison phase split the fuck up, stay away from the dozer, and only repair AFTER you just busted out of a prison as you'll be free for a little bit."
