            "Since 2002. Advance 2's American side stated that she has great speed just shy of Sonic's, Heroes shows her easily flying and throwing around great weights like Big the Cat, Sonic Battle tells us her run style makes it hard to even hit her and that she is doing serious training together with Amy.\n\nCream being weak is a rather recent development that contradicts a lot of previous writing of hers.   \nEven semi recent stuff like the 2021 Sonic Channel calendar art had a story that restates that she is fast enough in flight that shaking her off is a struggle even for Sonic.",
