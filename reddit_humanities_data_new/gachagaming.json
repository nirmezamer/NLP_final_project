We have an army of veteran summoners who are happy to share their opinions and recommendations. Whether you are new to the genre or a grizzled veteran, you can use this thread to ask for: \n\n* Help choosing which gacha game to start \n* Recommendations on using different emulators \n* Recommendations on finding a new gacha game to play \n* Help remembering the name of an old gacha game  \n* Updates on how games are doing from current players (\u201cHow is \\[game\\] these days?\u201d) \n* Any sort of advice relating to gacha games at all \n\nThis is also the place to ask general questions, like  \n\n* What people\u2019s favorite games or types of games are \n* How do people feel about a particular game feature or event \n* How do people feel about the monetization in whatever game \n* What do abbreviations mean \n* Where people get their news / information \n* What are people\u2019s favorite content creators \n* Even topics that are only indirectly related to gacha gaming, like happenings in the subreddit, international politics, celebrity gossip, etc.  \n\nReally, any post that is just asking a question belongs here.  \n\nYou can feel free to talk about or ask about anything at all in this thread, but just don\u2019t be surprised if your off-topic question is downvoted and you get no answers. If you are looking for game-specific help, you may ask for it here, but you are more likely to get better answers by posing those questions in their game-specific subreddits.  \n\nIf you want to contribute, please read the request thoroughly, and then make sure not to recommend something that they already tried. Please reply without bashing games or arguing with other recommenders \u2013 this is not a win-lose thing. Helpful replies should include the full names of anything. Keep in mind that new summoners may not know what \u201cGI\u201d or \u201cFGO\u201d or even \u201cF2P\u201d means, and even if they do then it\u2019s helpful to spell things out so that the results are more searchable.  \n\nRule #1 still applies, so make sure to keep it friendly. Religious and political discussions, personal information, and other such comments will be moderated. Make sure to follow The Reddiquette. With that said, feel free to talk about day-to-day life here and make acquaintance with your friendly gacha gamer neighbors.",

            "What game should I play?\n\nI like the aesthetics of honkai star rail and genshin impact. As for gameplay/combat, I like turn based combat or action combat that is very fast in movement and attacks(kinda like Nier automata). I want to be able to play on PC. More f2p friendly is better.",
            "Any gachas worth starting as a new player? I enjoy gachas like Epic Seven and Seven Knights, ie turn based gameplay. However, I am open to other styles of games.",
            "My pet theory on kektone is that his head was so big as a baby he gave his mom a lot of pain during child birth, so his mom hated him. Since then, he did not get enough love as a child so he had to attract attention to himself in any way possible, even if it is negative.",
            "What game should I play as a ex-FEH refugee? I always liked grinding and maxxing characters but couldn't stand the insane powercreep. Tried Genshin and hated the low rates, played for like 20-30 hrs and didn't get a single 5*. I also prefer games with auto-battle so I don't have to actively grind. Any recommendations?",
            "What gacha games are good to play when you have little time per day and doesn't need too much grind for gear",
            "Good day, I'm searching for gacha games and hoping if anyone could help recommend me one. Who knows, i might find diamonds among recommendations that you guys offer. I prefer a simple game like turn based. For example, my main games are fgo, uma musume and brown dust 2. I don't like open world games. I once tried genshin and wuwa upon my friend's recommendation but uninstalled it before reaching a week. Do you guys have gacha games that i could try?",
            "Any fun idle side games? With maybe an event going on?",
            "Long time dragon ball fan but never checked out their gacha games. Why are there two? Basically I\u2019m asking is one worth playing / better supported than the other, as I\u2019d like to check one out for fun.",
            "Looking for new gachas to try. My main experience is with FGO but after being burned out from it I'm taking a break and looking for newer ones to try out. I've also started Nikke and really like it so far. Biggest thing I'm looking for are ones with more in depth relationships/interactions between our character and our collected waifu's. At the moment I'm thinking of starting either Blue Archive or Arknights but I'd like recommendations for others as well (Leaning towards Blue Archive more as it seems newer and more popular, though I'll likely get to Arknights eventually as well as I like the character designs). I'm looking for more mobile oriented ones as I'm not that interested in the big open-world 3D ones at the moment. Any kind of in-game community interaction is also a big plus, like PVP and such. I'll also be mostly free to play with maybe a purchase here or there if there's a new character I particularly like.",
            "Looking for a new gacha to try preferably one that doesn't take too much time daily as I already play Arknights, star rail, BA, FGO, Genshin, Wuwa, there was some I heard of and was kind of interested in but don't know anything about or if they are worth playing those being, granblue (I like the fighting game and the characters and music seem cool), Girls Frontline (I don't know if I should play 1 or 2? I heard there was some drama with 2), kancolle (I don't know anything at all I just like the ship girls), uma musume (also don't know anything just like the horse girls). Also open to other suggestions, I usually prefer and play games longer if they have a good story and I get invested in, Arknights and FGO are ones I really enjoy the story for out of what I play. Games I've tried in the past  and wouldn't want to play again, path to nowhere, reverse 1999, alchemy stars (although I did play this one for about half a year).",
            "On Android... really enjoyed the gameplay, art style/story of ML:A, but I'm already running into walls of not having stuff to do as a f2p after 1 day. HSR was nice, but it only had like 10 characters last time I played it. Autobattling mechanics is something I prefer, since I like to keep it running while I'm working. I don't mind spending a bit of money after I've invested a couple weeks into it, but the depth and aesthetic appeal has to be there. Tried Azur Lane but the art style was a big turn off (i like Anime style, but not the off the wall superweeb stuff), as well as the UI. Good story is always a plus, though I found HSR and Arknights a little too verbose and drawn out (having to read 50 page cutscenes between every fight was a little too much for me). Though I'd rather have that than a shitty or no story at all. Thanks.",
            "Hiii so actually I'm searching for a specific type of game.\n\nI don't know if there's any player of Shikigami Wars: A Summoner's Tale that will see this post but for those who doesn't know it, that was a management game where you were upgrading your temple/village, I don't think there was a gacha function but there was quite a few nice characters, but the best feature in that game was the Alliance system and raids we could do. The community vibe in it and such.\n\nSo may sounds dumb but for players who played it: since it has discontinued, have you found a similar game?For those who didn't: do you know one in that fashion?\n\nI also liked the shikigami theme of the game\n\nThank you for the replies!",

Long time gacha enjoyer, drop most after a year (except 7ds which I\u2019ve been playing since launch) \n\nI only like new games that eventually have quick dailies (I have two kids).

            "You could try Arknights. I\u2019ve found it to have a fairly good rate of pulling new characters and powercreep is pretty mild. It\u2019s fairly old though, so you have to be ok having missed a bunch of limited characters. Can\u2019t auto battle a new stage but after beating it once you can. No skips apart from the weekly Annihiliation mode though.",
            "try AetherGazer\n\nit probably has the best banner rates, it has a character banner with 90 guarantee, no pity reset if non featured character appeared and it the weapon banner is 70 guarantee and its always there...no need to wait for reruns since you just select it on the character you want to put it.\n\nIt has 2 AI companions so you can basically AFK.\n\nvery friendly because you can use trial characters in the story\n\ncurrently on Anniversary, you get a free 5star of your choice, it includes Limited Banner characters.",
            "Honkai Star rail, once you are done with the game, dailies only take like 5-10 mins (WITH Auto so you can do something else meanwhile), grinding relics (gear) isn't too important either, I just enjoy building characters from level 1 to 80 and dont care much about relics.\n\nMy second to go is Azurlane, very f2p, no much grind needed if you are casual. (Like 5 mins a day)",
            "Path to Nowhere, but events are quite long",
            "Honkai Star Rail, Limbus Company, Reverse 1999 are the other big turn based gachas right now. \n\nSidenote, Limbus is very f2p friendly but I've heard the tutorial is so terrible that you'd be better off watching a youtube video about how to play, so you might want to consider that before you start.",

            "Eversoul has 1.5 anni coming soon I think, maybe you should give it a try when it drops. I know I'll be returning",
            "I prefer Dokkan because it is a full PVE experience with much simpler gameplay mechanics than Legends. It is also almost the 9th anniversary (July 7th). As for Legends, I never played it that much, but I think they are currently celebrating their 6th anniversary, so you could also check it out just to see how much stuff they are giving away.",
            "Wuwa been so generous so far. It's not that great of quality in anything except combat but it's still fun and addictive.",
            "try AetherGazer\n\n\nit probably has the best banner rates, it has a character banner with 90 guarantee, no pity reset if non featured character appeared and it the weapon banner is 70 guarantee and its always there...no need to wait for reruns since you just select it on the character you want to put it.\n\n\nvery friendly because you can use trial characters in the story\ncurrently on Anniversary, you get a free 5star of your choice, it includes Limited Banner characters unlike other popular games out there.\n\nor if AFK game is your thing, you can try Tower of God New World, it literally gives you 5 Pulls EVERDAY for NO REASON AT ALL, those wishes are not because they fucked up and were given as compensation like in other popular games out there.",

            "Before? The game launched at the end of December. If you ever actually touched a MICA game you would know they wouldn't redo the IP since it was a passion project to begin with as all the games are connected. They've lived off of 50-100k revenues across their games for 8 years now, they can handle 1 million a month. And when did I say global would carry? If anything it would be the KR server that would handle a bulk of the sales.",

            "It's funny that GFL community is very small compared to all those other gacha games. But it feels as if they are all scared of GFL2. Hence all these disinformation and harrasement and bullying.",

            "The problem with just 1 million per month will be the lack of content, a 3D game like Girls Frontline 2 is not cheap to produce.",

People keep on pulling this up as if it\u2019s a problem as if it is any different in P1. These new S rank valks are not as expensive as P1\u2019s so of course they have a reason to release more and bringing in how \u201ccheap\u201d P1 was is such a bs excuse. \n\nIn P1, you\u2019d need HoTr for 2 teams( 300 pulls) and then you would still need to gear the SPs and the DPSes which is not cheaper by much. Physical and ice in P1 wasn\u2019t different either, you still need to get the S rank supports and their gears which btw being free for 1 patch isn\u2019t making the game f2p by much when it\u2019s a one time only. \n\nHere for the breakdown for the amount of pulls needed for each elements, cause all these bs of P1 f2p and P2 not is driving me insane cause all these claims are born out of nostalgia and bias, NOT CLEAR NUMBERS:\n\nElemental teams:\nHoTr: 300\nSP valks: 240( both lightning and fire)\nDPS: 300 or 200( if it\u2019s sirin)\n\nIce:\nSushang: 200\nSP: 120\nDPS: 300 or 0 if you want to use HoTr and argue you\u2019d need her anyway so you cheap out in this department\n\nPhysical:\nHoRb: 300\nsupport: 240( both SI and TA cause i consider them different niches)\nDPS: 300 or 50 or 0 if triple HoRb support team\n\nSpecial mention to CE cause bleed teams want her: 120\n\nNow for P2:\nSena + Lantern + Thelema + Helia: 510\nAstral Op cause why not: 50\n\nThe total amount of crystals you\u2019d need for a functional team in all 3 elements in P2 is up to 560( counting Astral Op). P1 on the other hand would want: 500 for sus and HoTr, 360 for SPs and 300~50, adding up to 1160.\n\nFor physical, with songque coming, P2 would need an additional 150. While P1 physical team would need at least 540 for the cheapest option( 3 supports).\n\nWow this entire reply become lengthy very quickly.

Its just CCP pressures them into censoring just like they do with other media.

Otherwise \"cultured\" players will just move to the more fanservicey ones. \n\nIdk how much money \"cultured\" players generate to hoyo but I feel hoyo is still in the denial stage.

Saying Fu Hua represents Chinese culture etc. But thankfully they weren't unpleasent enough.\n\nYou are confusing things. Censoring old valks that have no audience is a CCP pressure. As the game is rated for 12 yos. If HI3 was rated M we would have kept our swimsuit skins and even touch system. \n\nCensoring new valkyries that shouldn't have fanservice in the first place due to their character (Kiana being innocent and Hua being Chinese figure) is done through playerbase pressure. They can still sneak in fanservice. But sometimes they get caught redhanded. Pardofelis for example was supposed to have a belly button. CCP pressured them to remove it. So now Pardo has a bare midriff but no belly button\n\nTencent's fanservice games are all rated M. As they are almost 10 times as big as Mihoyo they can afford to take risks. But if Mihoyo decided to make Genshin and HI3 M rated when they got a representative at CCP to keep their fanservice which they could already sneak in they would have lost all of their players between 12-18 age range in China. This is huge way bigger than anything fanservice can bring.",
            "There was some CN outrage when they seen Kiana combo attack during beta phase and hot had to change it.\nThere was A LOT of complains saying that it's immature for Kiana to do that pose and that they don't feel she's a strong warrior\nhttps://youtu.be/BFa_Q7Wow5M?si=WlYxQ4OPtn0Y6tJ5",

            "They quite literally got people filling official complains to the CCP. They got too big. There are feminists organisations in CN that literally sue them over and over. You can also see tons of bots in their bilbli revievs. The whole Bunny Girl stuff was fueled by people that didn't even played the game they just jumped on hate train because they despise hoyo. And hoyo do listen. They listen to CN only. Kuro shils won't admit it"
