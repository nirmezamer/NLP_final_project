            "**Base game works but DLC does not. Because of missing age rating?**\n\nHi everyone. My brother had purchased (through his child account) \"Jujutsu Kaizen Ultimate Edition\" on the PS Store, which included pre-release access to a DLC as well as the base game. The DLC came out a couple of weeks ago but he cannot access it from his account -- it just doesn't show up in his Store. The base game works fine.\n\nAfter trying all sorts of re-syncs and downloading options, my best guess now is that he cannot activate the DLC because the DLC is not age-rated in our region.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe base game is rated ESRB Teen in the US and PEGI 12 in Europe:  \n[https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0700-PPSA09536\\_00-JJTKCULTEDITION0](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0700-PPSA09536_00-JJTKCULTEDITION0)  \n[https://store.playstation.com/en-pl/product/EP0700-PPSA09535\\_00-JJKCVSX400000000](https://store.playstation.com/en-pl/product/EP0700-PPSA09535_00-JJKCVSX400000000)\n\nThe DLC is also ESRB Teen in the US:  \n[https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0700-PPSA09536\\_00-JJTKSMISHIDINVNT](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0700-PPSA09536_00-JJTKSMISHIDINVNT)\n\nBut in Europe, the DLC has no (PEGI) rating:  \n[https://store.playstation.com/en-pl/product/EP0700-PPSA09535\\_00-JJTKSMISHIDINVNT](https://store.playstation.com/en-pl/product/EP0700-PPSA09535_00-JJTKSMISHIDINVNT)\n\nI've tried contacting the publisher but got no real reply yet (just got asked for a proof of purchase and then silence for almost 2 weeks now).

            "So basically, I bought this really long ethernet cable and decided to connect it to what I think is my modem (I'm unsure). I have Google WiFi points, and with the new connection directly to the modem, my internet is six times faster on my computer but not the same for my PS5.\n\nFor some context, I have one long ethernet cable connected to a Zyxel switch, which then goes into my PC and my PS5. When I tried to connect to the LAN cable, it didn\u2019t work, and this error occurred: \"Photo\". I looked up some videos and Reddit posts, and I think I found a solution using a static IP address configuration. It worked, or at least it bypassed the connection with the cable but didn\u2019t connect me to the internet, leading to this error instead: \"Photo 2\". Now I am actually so clueless. People say to try different DNS servers like\u00a0[8.8.8.8](http://8.8.8.8/), but it doesn\u2019t work for me. And yes, I have restarted and reset my PS5. Please help!",

            "Hi fellow PS5'ers,\n\nI'm posting this in hope our Reddit magicians can help me fix my audio issues on my PS5. \n\nI've had an issue since a week or 4. For some weird reason all the audio devices I connect, bluetooth or wired (to controller), work well for a few seconds followed by a poofing noise, whereafter all audio dissapears. Tried different earpieces, have the same problem with all of them. \n\nMaking matters even more unlogical, switching the audio out to 'mono audio' seems to be a fix. On mono all headsets seem to work just fine. I don't need to tell you guys that gaming on mono audio is horrible, if not undoable.\n\nPS support does not help me at all - just receiving all kinds of standard replies and off-the-shelf fixes.  \n\nIs there anyone experiencing the same issues, and even better, knows how to fix it? \n\nHope you guys can help me!",

I have 1GB internet speeds but I\u2019m constantly freezing playing rocket league and Diablo 4 to the point it\u2019s unplayable.

            "Hey guys!\n\nWhen the PlayStation 5 first launched, I was lucky enough to get my hands on one. I remember transferring my ps4 data to my PS5 through the internet. I also remember it not really working right because a few of my saved data games were missing but I brushed it off. When the Switch OLED was announced, I traded in my old ps4 to GameStop to preorder the Switch. Before doing this however, I copied all of my ps4 saves to a usb flash drive. Just to have a backup. I was cleaning out the garage a few days ago and found the old PS4 usb drive. Currently I am trying to transfer the save data from some games (specifically LEGO games) to PS5 console storage with no luck. The USB Drive reads 57.1/61.5 GB so I know my PS4 save data is in there but when I try copying it to the PS5 it won\u2019t detect it. \u201cYour save data will appear here\u201d\nI have the USB 3.0 flash drive in the front ps5 port.",

            "Hello,\n\nI'm having an extremely unnecessarily frustrating situation, in which my own PS5 controllers refuse to connect to my PS5. This has been an issue ever since I wirelessly connected them to my PC, and now they ONLY want to connect to my PC. I've tried holding the reset button in the back of both controllers, and hooking up the controllers to the PS5 via USB cable, but still not working. It's like they got a taste of my PC and just absolutely refuse to go back to the PS5 no matter what I do. It's absurd that this isn't more of a simple process. Making me never want to connect my controllers to my PC again, if it's going to be this comically difficult to reconnect the PS5 CONTROLLERS to the PS5. Please help.",

            "Kind of an odd post maybe. I used to have all the time in the world for my favorite games, but now that I work crazy hours at a desk it\u2019s hard for me to stomach sitting at a desk after work too. The problem is I tend to favor ARPGs that have significant depth and/or difficulty. For example one of my favorite games is path of exile. I love the character progression/customization, leveling, crafting, itemizing, etc etc but it\u2019s really hard to find anything similar that I can play from my couch.\n\nAnyway I guess I\u2019m really looking for an ARPG or roguelike that I can play with a controller without being at a significant disadvantage. I know most of them have controller support but honestly the inventory management and menu systems look like a massive pain in the ass to deal with on a controller and I don\u2019t want to sacrifice speed.\n\nI have a PS5, steam deck, switch, and PC.

So if this isn\u2019t the correct place, will you kindly delete this and tell me where I can post this.\n\nBasically my PS5, monitor, OR setup doesn\u2019t want to stay at 120hz.\n\nThe picture is my setup. I have a PS5, an Astro Mixamp, Elgato, PC, and 2 monitors (both are the Acer Nitro KG251Q ZBIIP).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lirkkazcug7d1.jpeg?width=3797&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=73cc3d99152fe33e50583ac4936544d943cc94ac\n\nMonitor 1 is linked only to my PC and works at 120hz.\n\nMonitor 2 is linked up to my PS5, Astro Mixamp, Elgato, and PC. When I try to change the settings for the monitor to 120hz on my PC, my screen goes black and it reverts back to 60hz. Whenever I try to run PS5 exclusive games, some games work fine. However any shooter PS5 games will not work. The screen flickers black (usually for several seconds at a time). When I play those same games on the PS4 version, the screen does not flicker. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s because the PS4 versions are capped at 60hz. I tried messing around with the settings in the PS5 but I haven\u2019t figured out anything yet.\n\nLike I said, I feel like this has a lot of different places this topic can get to and I don\u2019t know exactly where to post it. I apologize in advance if this isn\u2019t the right place. I just don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m doing wrong with my monitor, PS5, or setup.",

            "Problem is when I got to rebuy it only brings up gta online. Which is just part of the game correct? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just going to tell the boy to play elden ring dlc",

            "Is it just the couch USB port you've tried for this?  This *should* work perfectly fine, but the port might be very low amperage.\n\nIs the behaviour any different using a phone charger on a wall socket?",

            "Thank you for the information, that cleans it up a lot more for me and explains it perfectly and kind of what I had an idea of myself but just needed the reassurance I wasn\u2019t going to be wasting my time.\n\nThat is my plan on what I\u2019m going to do too, going to pre-order it as soon as it goes live (hopefully they have a 2tb edition like the limited edition Series X releasing in fall too.), connect up my external HDD and the SSD inside of the console and get to it.\n\nGoing to grab myself the 4tb one because I have   a 4tb HDD for the series X as is and you'd never run out of room.",
            "If I create a European PSN account and get the free upgrade to ps5 from there, would I be able to transfert my saved data with an external hard drive or USB stick to my new account?\n\nThen I could get a gift card from Europe by email and buy the DLC, and play the DLC with the character from my saved data?",
            "No worries. I learned about it when I purchased that newer console and figured if it reformats on insertion, so be it, so I figured to jist leave the games on it as they were to see what happens. Was pleasantly surprised when everything was up and running again with zero fuss. \n\nMinor disclaimer that I'm guessing it'll work the same way on PS5 Pro but I think common sense dictates they're hardly going to change up how installs are read and authenticated, file format used, etc.\n\nHooo yeah 4TB is spicy as hell. I remember when I bought that HDD for my PS4 Pro and said \"I'll never fill 4TB!\"... yeah that was a lie lol.",
            "You'd need to buy and install the DLC from the EU store, and then switch back to your Canadian account to play it. You can't transfer saved data between accounts."

With around 20-30 hours of new challenging content and areas, designed for veteran players, is the label \"expansion\" a bit of an understatement. Considering the sheer amount of new elements, including some of the most spectular boss fights of the series, smaller shortcomings such as reused enemy types that could've used a bigger facelift, or that upgrades only give you a generic boost for two values, carry no weight in the full picture.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Checkpoint Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/563/checkpoint-gaming)** - [Omi Koulas](https://opencritic.com/critic/5958/omi-koulas) - [10 / 10](https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2024/06/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-pure-and-radiant/)\n\n>Shadow of the Erdtree not only expands upon Elden Ring's lore and gameplay mechanics but also enriches the experience with its atmospheric storytelling and intricate world design. It beckons players to embrace the daunting journey through the Shadow Realm, promising a gripping adventure that resonates with the hallmark blend of challenge and discovery. What's on offer is one of the best FromSoftware experiences to date, capturing everything that made Elden Ring special and more.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ComicBook.com](https://opencritic.com/outlet/862/comicbook-com)** - [Tanner Dedmon](https://opencritic.com/critic/9246/tanner-dedmon) - [5 / 5 ](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/)\n\n>There's no doubt in my mind that there's more to do still in Shadow of the Erdtree if not in this playthrough than definitely the next. If anything, all those missed connections and areas unexplored only make the prospect of returning to the Realm of Shadow on New Game+ with a bunch of new toys to play with that much more enticing.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ComingSoon.net](https://opencritic.com/outlet/845/comingsoon-net)** - [Tyler Treese](https://opencritic.com/critic/65/tyler-treese) - [9.5 / 10](https://www.comingsoon.net/games/reviews/1770021-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review)\n\n>This massive expansion makes an all-time great game even better and is a must-purchase for those who have finished the original.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Destructoid](https://opencritic.com/outlet/90/destructoid)** - [Chris Carter](https://opencritic.com/critic/431/chris-carter), [Steven Mills](https://opencritic.com/critic/10000/steven-mills) - [9.5 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/)\n\n>I think that\u2019s the biggest point here, is that even though my expectations were high, Shadow of the Erdtree still managed to exceed them. From Software probably could have just added more Elden Ring and that would have been solid enough, but instead, Shadow of the Erdtree is yet another innovative iteration of the genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Sam Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/9291/sam-smith) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/elden-ring/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-a-sublime-swansong-that-removes-all-tarnish-2778364/)\n\n>Shadow of the Erdtree is a fitting tribute to Elden Ring and a stunning finale that manages to surprise and shock us all over again. Those who enjoyed the base game will find much more to get their teeth into. This signs off the Elden Ring chapter of FromSoftware\u2019s journey so conclusively and impressively, that it invokes questions about how they will ever top it again.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digital Trends](https://opencritic.com/outlet/124/digital-trends)** - [George Yang](https://opencritic.com/critic/7294/george-yang) - [4.5 / 5 ](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/)\n\n>Shadow of the Erdtree is so packed with new content that it almost feels like a sequel to Elden Ring.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Entertainment Geekly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/874/entertainment-geekly)** - [Luis Alvaro](https://opencritic.com/critic/9991/luis-alvaro) - [4.5 / 5](https://www.entertainmentgeekly.com/2024/06/18/shadow-of-the-erdtree-elden-rings-darkest-adventure-yet-review/)\n\n>The daunting challenges ahead, the spirit of adventure and discovery that defines Elden Ring is ever-present, urging the Tarnished to rise again. With its intricate design and immersive storytelling, \u201cShadow of the Erdtree\u201d reminds us of the enduring allure of Elden Ring, promising countless hours of enthralling gameplay.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Eurogamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/114/eurogamer)** - [Alexis Ong](https://opencritic.com/critic/7984/alexis-ong) - [3 / 5](https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review)\n\n>Much of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is more of the same gruelling beauty - but a shift to explict storytelling and signposting means its essence as a living, evolving shared text is lost.\n\n-------------\n\n**[FandomWire](https://opencritic.com/outlet/886/fandomwire)** - [Tanay Sharma](https://opencritic.com/critic/10503/tanay-sharma) - [10 / 10](https://fandomwire.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-a-fromsoftware/)\n\n>The culture around FromSoftware suggests that we should never expect stories to be directly told to us, and that remains true with Shadow of the Erdtree. I've always been an admirer of art that mimics life. In the context of Hidetaka Miyazaki's undying legacy, I do believe that Shadow of the Erdtree is yet another work of art that builds on the studio\u2019s history of delivering polished gameplay.\n>\n>Whether you choose to wield a fresh, exciting weapon like the Death Knight\u2019s Twin Axes or play with something trustworthy like the Rivers of Blood from the base game, Shadow of the Erdtree will still be a fulfilling journey worthy of your time, attention, and courage.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Fextralife](https://opencritic.com/outlet/501/fextralife)** - Fexelea - [9.6 / 10](https://fextralife.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/)\n\n>Shadow of the Erdtree is an incredible expansion that no gamer should miss out on, adding even more value to an already outstanding game. With only minor performance issues and a few misses on the landscape, the expansion is challenging but rewarding, and full of secrets to discover. This is the kind of DLC every studio should aim to deliver, and very few can claim to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GGRecon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/828/ggrecon)** - [Harry Boulton](https://opencritic.com/critic/9323/harry-boulton) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.ggrecon.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/)\n\n>Shadow of the Erdtree is a staggering achievement, and among the best work that FromSoftware has produced. It expands upon Elden Ring with an intricately woven narrative, unrelenting boss challenges, and a world so full of secrets that it's hard to know whether you've truly seen everything the expansion has to offer.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game Informer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/35/game-informer)** - [Marcus Stewart](https://opencritic.com/critic/6102/marcus-stewart) - [9.8 / 10](https://www.gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/an-emphatic-exclamation-point)\n\n>The boring but ultimately correct shorthand to summarize Shadow of the Erdtree is that it\u2019s more Elden Ring. The incredible sense of discovery, fantastic dungeon design, entertainingly deep combat, and intriguing lore and characters that defined From Software\u2019s 2022 masterpiece all apply to this expansion.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Victor Vit\u00f3rio](https://opencritic.com/critic/9556/victor-vit-rio) - *Portuguese* - [9 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2024/06/analise-dlc-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review.html)\n\n>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is a magnificent farewell to the saga of the Tainted One and the demigods. Even if FromSoftware made a bit of a mistake in balancing the bosses, there is enough content to last an entire game and anyone who enjoyed the base will have a lot to enjoy here, especially when exploring the paths and secrets to discover the intricate verticality of the world. open.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamefa](https://opencritic.com/outlet/498/gamefa)** - [mohammad hossein karimi](https://opencritic.com/critic/9320/mohammad-hossein-karimi) - *Persian* - [8.7 / 10](https://gamefa.com/1053881/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/)\n\n>Shadow of the Erdtree is a successful attempt to recapture the emotions and surprises you had already experienced in Elden Ring. This is a game that in terms of both exploration and difficulty, aims at hardcore audiences and wants you to have a more intense experience than the base game. The more complex structure of the map and the way the bosses are designed are proof that FromSoftware expects you to spend time on their gigantic expansion. However, in the way of surpassing the base game and enhancing its strengths, some bad habits inherent in the base game are also repeated with greater intensity, which cannot be ignored. Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree portrays FromSoftware  a bit fiery, hot-tempered, out-of-control in aspects like boss design and scale. Still, this is an essential experience for fans of the base game that gives more meaning to the main game.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Johnny Hurricane](https://opencritic.com/critic/6599/johnny-hurricane) - [90 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/)\n\n>Shadow of the Erdtree is the perfect swan song to Elden Ring. It gives you all the challenge, the loot, and the lore of the base game in a smaller chunk. Prepare to lose yourself to its siren call yet again.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Instincts](https://opencritic.com/outlet/872/gaming-instincts)** - [Leonid Melikhov](https://opencritic.com/critic/1206/leonid-melikhov) - [10 / 10](https://www.gaminginstincts.com/review/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/)\n\n>Shadow of The Erdtree is an excellent send off to Elden Ring. Whatever it is that you\u2019ve loved about the original game will be included here. Whether its exploring beautiful new areas with awesome interconnected level design or finding that one gorgeous vista where you can just stand around and gawk at the insane sense of scale. You will encounter plenty of challenging of new challenging bosses and optional bosses. You will discover new builds, new items, new weapons, summons and magics to use for your current and future playthroughs. There is plenty of replay-value here as I\u2019ve previously mentioned Shadow of the Ertdtree is about as big as Limgrave with tons of things to discover.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - [Rashid Sayed](https://opencritic.com/critic/1200/rashid-sayed) - [10 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-review-unparalleled)\n\n>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is an excellent follow up to the base game.

On one hand, it's a masterfully woven experience that expands on the contents of the base game, whereas on the other it leaves much more to be desired with its disappointing final boss.

Shadow of the Erdtree is meant to test the mettle of the game's hardcore audience and isn't going to let up soon.

This expansion feels like it fully completes Elden Ring, a game that already felt like a whole project, in a way I didn't even know it needed to be completed.

So if you find you are finding some area of the game far too difficult, don't immediately assume that you suck, because chances are that it is indeed too difficult for your level. In that case you can always leave and explore some other region of the map, level up, find some new powerful weapons and come back.\n\nAnd the game has lots of in built difficulty modifiers to make up for the lack of difficulty options in the menu: for example spirit summons. A lot of people will tell you that using spirit summons, OP magic builds etc are not the intended way to play the game. Those people are idiots. Play it exactly the way you enjoy it.

            "I think i get your point. I enjoyed the game but found a lot of things underwhelming that dulled the experience.\n\n Exploration, for the most part, was a dissapointment (finding mushrooms, arteria leaves and crafting materials in chests hidden behind fake walls is just peak dissapointment), the crafting system was borderline useless and annoying to use. Not to mention most weapons are ass, and most armor items look like absolute shit.\n\nThe tailoring system is most probably a test project they gave to a junior developer just so he could prove he could write code. It's a basically a toggle option.\n\nAshes of War were a nice addition but the fact you can only have 1 per weapon was a major letdown. They could absolutely implement 2 slots for ashes of war per weapon very easily but they didn't, which limits your combat options (although i doubt most people mind that). That was also something that annoyed me with Sekiro where you could only equip one martial art, so you couldn't do cool combos like High Monk into Praying Strikes.\n\nSpeaking of Sekiro, you can't parry like so in Elden Ring. The Elden Ring Reforged mod has incorporated a similar parry system into the game, which just makes you wonder why FromSoft doesn't just expand upon their combat system in more active ways than adding minute changes per installment.\n\nWith those things in mind, i am going into the DLC just for the bosses and the fighting in general.

Not that I really care all that much. I don't hate From games so I have no idea where that sentiment comes from fans. Most fans seem to love the games. I would say they might be getting a little samey these days for me personally, but that's in general for a lot of games with sequels and other games in the same genre and style.\n\nBasically, it's like okay another game that is basically the same with some new stuff... how does that equate to 10/10 IDK. But whatever at this point.\n\nThere just seems to be a general lack of actual criticism in media these days. Look at all the movies on Rotten Tomatoes that just get free passes and 80% plus while being complete garbage or in the least mediocre.\n\nSame things with gaming these days. God of War at least had some passing criticisms here and there.\n\nWith past Souls games my criticisms are the absence of any decent plot or story, and no I don't want to be hand fed another Witcher 3, but animations and general storytelling were severely lacking in those games, and also in other games like Zelda.\n\nLike Bloodborne's story was fucking garbage. Where were the criticisms on the incoherent mess that it was lmao? There were none. Instead, people tried to convince me it was a Studio Ghibli movie with less is more. No, no it wasn't. The story was fucking stupid beyond belief. Studio Ghibli stories are not stupid, they are coherent and mesmerizing. Lore is one thing, but when lore is all you have well good lord. \n\nBut then you have games like Horizon with much more fleshed out stories that were absolutely criticized for any irritating thing and in plenty of other areas... it's just a lack of criticism on things like this that bothers me when it is directly applied to other Western games.\n\nWhen BOTW came out MANY reviewers acted like it was the first open world game they ever played.

Because as great as Skyrim and Witcher were, the gameplay for both were ass. They did pretty much everything else well but the actual gameplay were slogs for me and others. With Elden Ring, you have over 300 weapon base game and many different classes you can do. Hell, even though Bloodborne never had the variety the trick weapon system was incredibly well done and more than made up for lack of variety. And then you have Sekiro, it\u2019s literally one weapon and one mechanic but it does it with perfection.\n\nAdd in all the unique bosses with great OSTs on top of all of that, and there\u2019s a reason why these games are so beloved.",

I did not even finish DS3 yet, mostly due to PC exploit they had to patch and just never coming back, but I probably will finish it at some point. But I will say by 3 I was getting pretty tired of the formula. Tired of characters not moving their mouths, tired of their shitty, random dialog, and things were starting to feel way too samey.\n\nI can't off the top of my head remember too many characters in From games. But there are a few I did really enjoy, but that enjoyment is usually short lived because the worlds are pretty dead overall. There just isn't much that is dynamic happening, so the characters feel really one dimensional to me.\n\nElden Ring I have yet to attempt all the way through, as I was saving it for when my PC can run it really well. Sekiro might be next for me IDK. Either or.\n\nI also slightly disagree on Witcher 3, but that's because with mods that game became a much better experience as close to vanilla as possible but way more tuned and dynamic. Hell they even incorporated a bunch of those mods in their newest edition. I thought Witcher 3 was fine for what it was in combat on the hardest difficulty.\n\nI'd even say some of Witcher 3 was pretty boring because the main quest keeps getting so mired in side quests and other shit that you forget what the fuck is even going on half the time.\n\nI definitely don't want From games to become Witcher 3, but that game is also on another level with storytelling for sure almost to the point it needed to go the other way lol.\n\nI'd just appreciate if From could write some convincing characters with more dynamic storytelling that mattered. A plot that actually made more sense and wasn't bereft of emotion and passionate writing. Definitely NOT Witcher 3 though.",
            "I mean Bloodborne's lore is good, but it's story is non-existent and terrible. They don't even have moving mouths ffs. It's like a game story from 20 years ago that's... not good. It makes almost no sense at all. The lore is pretty good and fun to be immersed in, but it's not like there is some driving force within the game to finish things. There is no emotion for me to continue at all. The environments and the weapons and builds and boss fights are why I continue. Not because they are Ghibli in game form.\n\nStudio Ghibli often do less is more story. But their writers are amazing, and so are their characters, and you care about their characters.\n\nFrom isn't on that level nor should they ever be perceived to be on that level. You need an actual coherent story to be compared to a studio of that stature. They don't have that.\n\nThis is where I agree fans do have these criticisms, but I RARELY see this from game journalism. Zelda is even worse, and you almost NEVER see anybody point a single finger at their absolutely SHIT storytelling that is so much worse than From it's hilarious.\n\nThe reason they don't have those stories is of course because they are very hard to do and they take a lot of money and time to put forth. But that's not something they are ever criticized for, yet games that actually try to do that but don't quite succeed are ripped apart all the time.\n\nI did not think Horizon was perfect or anywhere close. It was actually boring in parts, but hey it tried to do it, and they did innovate on some detail and lovely additions to NPCs and what not. Horizon was also ripped apart for a variety of things that were completely unfair like its combat, which was stellar on Ultra Hard.\n\nWhen that game came out its combat and enemies and animations put BOTW to fucking shame. But all we heard was fuck, BOTW invented open worlds and is the best thing that has ever been made despite having hardly any enemies, shit easy combat, empty open world, Ubisoft towers, and a story that would make a 14 year old question its quality.\n\nIDK but when all the 10/10s come out I don't even care what game it is now, I just actively disengage because they are obviously just shilling a product whether they enjoy it or not doesn't really matter. It's time to shill boys. 10/10.",
            "In the industry it was well known that giving Japanese games, high profile ones and ESPECIALLY Nintendo games, was bad for press. It was even talked about by various people years ago.\n\nIf BOTW did not prove that to you, then nothing ever will. Continue to live in ignorance I guess.\n\nBG3 definitely rode hype and that hype surely ended up in a lot of reviews, but I can't really say as I have not played it. \n\nI distinctly remember it getting a bit more criticism than say BOTW though.\n\nLiterally, one guy who tried to criticize BOTW at a prominent mag got death threats lmao.",
            "And yet the gameplay and the world / exploration of Souls games are second to none, which for video games are very important.",
            "Agreed. While I even enjoyed DS3 a lot, and I think it was the culmination of their Dark Souls talent, it was literally the same old shit. I can't even tell you ONE single character in that game I remember man. I don't think that is a very good sign really when it comes to lore either, because it's clear nothing grabbed me at all. I do remember that I liked some sequences and some dialog for sure, but I can't for life of me give a single fuck about any of it past the time I played. I still haven't even beaten the game because by and large I just did not give a single shit by the end of it. Been there done that 100 times. It was fun, I might go back to it now that they fixed the PC version to not have severe exploits to your PC, but I still don't really get why people go gaga over lore lol.\n\nI do remember some of the art and stuff though, because that was what remained important to me in that game. But as far as characters they just disappear from my brain the minute I stop playing basically outside a chosen few. Because the lines they do have are so arbitrary, and so few, that it really does not stick with somebody like myself that values actual characters.",

The core issue is that immersion is a big deal for me. Things that break immersion are repeated deaths due to performance issues or bugs and surroundings that pop in around you.",
            "The most obtuse they got was in the first one not really explaining what the stats did.\n\nAll the games are externally linear and didn\u2019t need a map.  If you ever got lost or didn\u2019t know where to it was simply because you didn\u2019t talk to the npcs.\n\nThat\u2019s an interesting sample of you not having decent sense that an enemy that can nearly one shot you is too high a level to fight right now.  You sound like someone that tried to fight the asylum demon with your bare hands because you didn\u2019t see the hole in the wall to the left.  Or somebody that didn\u2019t talk to the crestfallen guy twice and tried to fight the skeletons.\n\nNone of that is obtuse the game is communicating quite clearly this isn\u2019t something you can handle right now go somewhere else.",

And that's all it has.\n\nIt does attempt character animation and dialog. Not moving lips lol, but it does try to convince you that there is a story. Yes, it's worse than some PS1 games, but they did attempt that.\n\nYou can make excuses all you want for lack of a great writer, animators, et cetera. You can't just wish it away though, because there was clearly an attempt however bad it was lol.",

Yeah, these game are for me.\n\nThat doesn't mean incoherent and absolutely shit storytelling are gonna get a pass from me okay? From games can have great characters too. They just can't write them it seems like to me, because they don't have that capability, like most games in general even most of the ones that try to do this don't succeed.\n\nIt's also not a conspiracy that isn't widely known by anybody not delusional. It was even in the press years ago that giving mainline Nintendo games poor scores was a non-thing at the big mags because it was bad for press. Wrong again.\n\nAlso, we lived through the madness of BOTW. In no sane world is that game even close to a 10, but it was basically across the board lauded as the game of the century. It had almost no innovation, poor story and characters, a weak open world with cool areas here and there, bad enemy variety, horrendous weapon breaking, Ubisoft towers, and to top it off it was easy as piss. \n\nThis game was somehow lauded as something that changed open worlds and gaming forever. Yet it basically just copied Ubisoft open worlds with absolutely the worst story and characters in a game above an 8 that I can remember. Slapped with Zelda, it somehow ascended to the heavens as the greatest product ever made.\n\nIt also looked and played like shit on the Switch. Plug this game into a 4K TV and laugh. It was the basically the prime time for anyone with half a brain emulating every single thing Nintendo did because their hardware was so garbage.",
            "No, they don't lol. BOTW would not be where it is if people actually criticized its many weaknesses. Same with Mario Odyssey. You are just cherrypicking a tiny tiny section of one critical review and going SEE CRITICISM. LMAO get out. \n\nTOTK is one of the laziest sequels in recent memory, of course it was going to receive some criticism. BUT OH CHECK the metacritic on that one bud.\n\n9 fucking 6 genius. You just literally made the dumbest post you possibly could have. The irony is so high it's outrageous. You picked one of the highest rated games of all time, and then said oh man they really criticized this game.\n\nExcept they didn't. \n\nHow many of the top games are from Japan? How many of those got perfect 10s across the board in recent times? A shitload.",
            "There's a good amount to go into on that, but you're not gonna be swayed anyways. If you like the game, great. It's not in a state that's playable for me. I'm complaining because I really WANT to play it. I wouldn't be making a fuss if I was just trying to hate on it.",
            "That's just like, your opinion, man",

That's just silly. Fromsoft games are fantastic games in every way possible from worldbuilding to environmental storytelling to level design, and would still be enjoyable even without punishing difficulty. And most of these games can already easily be broken in half with cheese strategies. Also many of the hardcore fans already think they are too easy and regularly play with ridiculous self-imposed restrictions to boost the challenge even further. There are also plenty of highly successful action games out there marketed towards hardcore gamers that weren't ruined by including easy modes (devil may cry, ninja gaiden and doom, for example.)\n\nJust be honest and admit that you don't want your game to be accessible to casual gamers lol.

You can adjust the game's difficulty to your preference, and both easy and challenging experiences are equally rewarding.\n\nIf you want to make combat easier, you can find items, weapons, clothing, skills, and upgrade paths that help you achieve that (you can literally 1 shot bosses). This approach, which requires players to explore and use their brains rather than a simple difficulty slider, is a key factor in Elden Ring's success.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the hardcore crowd that purposely limit their skills / levels to make their playthrough punishingly difficult.

Just not for me.",

I literally do not have the time for it. So it's a real shame.",

            "Personally I don\u2019t think it would be game or vision ruining if FromSoft decided to add it. There are other games that have difficulty as the fundamental point, that still have assist modes (Celeste, Darkest Dungeon, even Pathologic 2).",

            "I beat the main game multiple times on console, but I I bought it for PC so I can use mods and the first thing I did was install a difficulty mod. It made the game so much more enjoyable for me. It isn\u2019t an \u201ceasy mode\u201d and is still challenging.. it\u2019s just slightly less challenging and takes those fights that are borderline unfair and knocks it down a few notches to almost unfair. \n\nSo turning down the difficulty actually has made me put another 100 hours into the game and with all the other cool mods I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be much, much more time than that. \n\nBasically my point is that I respect the vision and whatnot and I understand why he doesn\u2019t want to add a difficulty toggle because it wouldn\u2019t be a SoulsBorne game anymore.. but it most definitely doesn\u2019t break the game. You still die a decent amount just not nearly as much. Boss fights still take 10-20 tries.. just not 50-100 tries like it did me before.",

In Elden Ring particularily which is a massive open world, on my first playthrough I spent as much time on the wiki as I did actually playing the game.

Doesn't need to mark your map as to where to go (maybe where you picked it up) but even just a conversation history.\n\nI had a friend who was praising the game because he had to keep a physical notebook as a quest log, like it was a feature.  I am sorry, but if you need to keep a notebook to track something in game it should just be included in the game.",

The combat, at least for melee users, is unpredictable, boring, and oftentimes straight up just confusing. The flow, rhythm, dance-like feeling from previous games is entirely gone for me. I probably won't even play the DLC, to be honest. Tired of watching bosses jump around going super saiyan mode while I have... yay a jump button now! (A button they also heavily force you to use due to some bosses spamming tiresome, boring-ass ground-slamming attacks or explosive AOEs. Gets lame.) For me, they completely missed the mark with the bosses.",

I\u2019ll take the downvotes, the game is poorly balanced, and that hasn\u2019t changed since release. So overall I disagree that if you want a more casual experience (more casual, not objectively casual, as all fromsoft games are challenging) you should go with Elden Ring.\u00a0\n\nDemon\u2019s Souls remake is the actual answer for you, if you really want to give these games a shot.\u00a0",
            "For me, the problem with fromsoft games is the controls. Your character responds to button presses like they're half asleep and enemies can often hit you in weird and unexpected places that feel very cheap, even through walls.\n\n I easily beat the Valkyries in God of War which are considered up there for some of the hardest boss fights of all time but the controls are very snappy and responsive so through repetition you can really learn the patterns. It never felt cheap.",

            "I'm glad someone else feels this way. The souls games feel like they are going down a route that mmo raids have and I don't really like it. In mmos, raids are a big draw, and the people doing them wanted them to be harder and harder. It makes sense because their skill set is always getting better, they want harder content to match it. Problem is for any new player getting into it, they haven't put thousands of hours in so the raids became a massive wall. Not impossible to climb, but certainly drove people away.\n\nElden ring isn't quite their yet IMO, but it's def trending towards that. I don't think they can keep trying to make challenging content for people who literally have 4000+ hours in this series. I think malenia def crossed the line, but I can kinda give her a pass because it's optional endgame content. If they made a boss like malenia a mandatory boss I think that's way too far.",
            ">Some Elden Ring bosses feel like someone having a drug overdose violently freaking out on the floor.\n\nThe ulcerated tree spirits are some of my last favorite fights because of this. I think they were expirementing with a highly mobile boss, sure. But I really hate fighting a basically amorphous blob where it's really hard to tell if the boss is attacking or just moving. Since it's so big sometimes you go next to it to attack with a shorter weapon and just get damaged because it's still on its \"moving attack\" phase. You have to pay really close attention to the position of said blob and try to decipher it's current state.",
            "Agree. And I still liked Elden Ring, I played it for weeks solid and really enjoyed it... but the difficulty is all over the place. Too many bosses where you're sat basically just bored waiting for their 40 second anime combo to end. Too many camera issues, big boss models clipping through walls, jank hitboxes, bosses running miles away.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum... I can equip the Blasphemous Blade and just invincibly chew through every single boss in the game with zero effort.\n\nI don't think Elden Ring is too difficult or too hard. I think they just did a bad job of the difficulty in general. Generally feels like they ran out of time and couldn't afford to take a critical view of how the entire game played. DS3 did almost everything better, even with its own faults.\n\nMiyazaki likes the difficulty because it IS a draw for the game and that's fine. But it's also a shield to hide behind when criticism over fairly shoddy design comes up, and that has proven extremely effective.\n\nStill enjoyed the game but I also suspect it gets a bit too much benefit of the doubt. It gets played off with an extremely charitable \"choose your own difficulty!\" take but my own experience is that it just feels like a mess. Same with the quest system, it does get a lot of criticism but people seem to somehow avoid actually just saying that it's crap and they did a bad job.",
            "Some of those made me realise I don't actually dislike soulslikes, I just don't like From's version of them.  Full props to them for creating the whole genre, but they aren't for me in their current design philosophy.  \n\nI played Strangers of Paradise with rock bottom expectations and actually ended up loving it.",
            "yeah, that's my take on this. games with the \"hard\" tag without adjustment options don't see my money.  \n\nbeen burned a few times already after getting back into gaming a few years ago and to me that's even more frustrating than buying a bad game.\n\nanyway, when dead cells added difficulty options in an update i first tried it on psplus and then immediately bought it for my switch with all DLCs and have now played roughly 100 hours with great joy.  \n\nif they'd do something in that direction for returnal... instabuy",

            "I agree with your comment, and I would also take it one step further and just simply do what most other developers do and say this is the normal difficulty, the way the game was intended to be played. The difficulty sliders can do something as simple as make the hero hit harder or the enemies have more life. Look at all the fantastic accessibility settings in Sony first party titles recently, from softer wouldn\u2019t have to go that far, but simple sliders like that would go along way into making this game more accessible to people who want casual gaming experience and to experience the incredible world that Elden ring has to offer.",

I'm GenX and I am not nearly as dexterous and mentally quick as I used to be.  \n\nI'm sorry but changing the difficulty level is nothing more than a configuration option. I will pay you $100 for the game to let me do that right now. And I won't ever claim I beat the game.  Again I love this game but it's not made for older dudes with busy lives. \n\nI find this whole thing silly. Imagine wanting to play basketball but only being able to play it against NBA players.  I just want to shoot some hoops and not get dunked on 50 times a game.  Nope sorry, if you want to play you just have to learn how to dunk. Get guud = Jump higher.",

Maybe a slight random delay to fake it noticing you healing.",
            "I remember my brother and I attempted Malenia together, and realized just how bad their input detection is. To test it, we both ran circles around her from a safe distance, but that was it. Only sprinting, no attacks, no healing.. she slowly walked towards us the entire time. A good 15 seconds or so and she didn't do a damn thing. The second one of us tapped an attack, not even one that would have hit her, she retaliated.",
            "Yeah this is it really, I finished DS2 a couple of times but the fanbase of these games is embarrassing. It's like their main source of pride is being able to beat a difficult game, and they want to gatekeep those games, it's very pathetic and cringeworthy.",

            "100% this. Argument against difficulty at this point is just a point of pride for these guys and the dev having his head in his ass.\n\nFor the most part, I understand a great deal why any of the previous Fromsoft titles don't have difficulty settings. The games are literally built in a way where the insane difficulty is the foundation of its entertainment. If it had difficulty setting, you may turn it down way sooner than you should and then not enjoy the game for what it should be.\n\nWith Elden Ring, the enemies are so fucking ridiculous with artificial difficulty that I feel the argument is thrown out the window. And don't let any of its vet players try to tell you it's the easy Fromsoft game because it's not if you play it straight. It's the easiest one to cheese, which a ton of these guys rely on to get through Fromsoft games. They have fun beating the games mechanics by exploiting it, not necessarily by besting it. Which is fine, but it's dishonest in the arguments of difficulty.",
            "It still should have accesibility options, including difficulty, i'll never change my mind about that. I play on PC and use WeMod to tweak the experience to my liking, and there still are many boss fights that don't give me space to breathe. \n\nAlso, how can someone play a game and die for a boss 100 Times, get mad and say \"i hate this fucking game\" out of frustration...But the moment they beat that boss they automatucally say the game is a masterpiece and that boss fight was amazing. Doesn't make sense for me.\n\nAnd how come people trash talk the gamers that use easy mode mod but don't do the same to people that tweak the game to make it harder? When you make it easier you're \"ruining the director vision\", but when you make it harder it's okay?",

What i can say tho, is every other FromSoft DLC has had a significantly lower difficulty spike over the base game.\n\nAlso, what definitely aint a me issue is the 2 bosses ive fought so far are kind of ass. One of them having 2 versions of an attack with the exact same animation, one that 2 shots & one that 1 shots, pretty sure i could survive the 1 shot if i just let it hit me instead of getting counterhit, but no way to tell whats what. The other being >!Divine Beast!< which somehow combined a lot of the worst aspects of Elden Ring boss design into one boss, the main and purely objective issues being its hitbox just lets weapons pass through it at points, even greatswords (Beast Clergyman has the same issue) & AOE attacks having a larger hitbox than their visual effect, which has been an issue since the CNT on many enemies in the game, Tree Sentinel being first offender that comes to mind. Also, framerate seems to shit the bed when the >!Divine Beats!< does certain attacks (PS5).\n\nTL;DR: Im not saying the DLC is overtuned, and i recognise my issue is likely a skill issue, but it's a significantly higher difficulty spike over the base game compared to any of Froms previous DLCs.

One thing I don\u2019t see discussed enough in these Souls difficulty discussions is how community focused souls games are. Despite being (mostly) single player games, they incorporate so many elements that allow collaboration and communication between players. Between summoning, messages left on the ground by other players, invasions, the wikis and forums you\u2019ll almost certainly need to visit to not miss anything.. the community aspect is core to getting the full enjoyment out of a souls game IMO. \n\nOf course there\u2019s build variations, skill differences, etc. but I think it\u2019s cool that players are all faced with the same challenge. Seeing an \u201cI did it!\u201d message after a tough boss fight that you didn\u2019t think you\u2019d manage to beat is a great reminder that someone else was suffering just the same as you but damn, you still eventually won the battle. As silly as this sounds, it\u2019s the little moments like that that make souls game\u2019s different from anything else and I think those moments don\u2019t carry the same weight if everyone is on a different difficulty.

With most games, it's built from the ground up with being easy in mind, and then they tack on a hard mode which either isn't actually very challenging, or is just frustrating and annoying and turns everything into bullet sponges.\n\nIf Elden Ring produced the same exact game and then just tacked on a feature that made the enemies paper machete, it would not be enjoyable, it would just be deceptive. The game just isn't built to be played like that, just like those easy games with hard difficulty usually aren't truly built to be played on said difficulty. When it comes to the latter game though if you complain frequently people just dismiss you and say you just play it on a normal - which is what I often wind up doing, the most enjoyable difficulty is usually the one the game was built with in mind. But if Elden Ring introduced an easy mode, people would buy it thinking oh I can play that elden ring game finally, and then play it on easy and be annoyed. Because the game isn't truly built with that in mind. Half the game is simply memorizing enemy move sets, and if they're paper machete you don't have to do that. Either Miyazaki then does as the people in the former games do, and just dismissively says to change the difficulty to the one it was built for. Or he makes more fundamental game design decisions, which will alter the whole formula and make it not as tuned to challenging difficulty as it was previously.",

Your orientation as you leave the starting area, the tree sentinel, and the sites of grace all point you to the north/east, while a lot of level appropriate areas are actually in the complete opposite direction to the south. Most players don't even think to explore that direction until they are way overlevelled.\n\nEdit: the effect of this being brand new players bashing themselves into the roadblock of Morgott, the kill zone/ confusing layout of the castle, or fucking caelid lmao.

            "Shiiiet no lol",
            "This is actually a pretty good article that discusses what accessibility for games can look like (using The Last of Us Part 2 as an example):\n\n[https://www.npr.org/2024/06/09/nx-s1-4995567/video-game-creators-are-working-to-make-games-more-accessible-for-disabled-people](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/09/nx-s1-4995567/video-game-creators-are-working-to-make-games-more-accessible-for-disabled-people)\n\nBut basically there are options a game can add that improves accessibility without changing the difficulty or mode of play. Some games have audio cues, screen reader options, and sonar for a blind person to play. Other games let you customize mapping so you can play it with any sort of controller (and I remember there was a person who had a special set of controls that used his mouth and chin as long as he could map keys). Adding in certain visual cues for people who are deaf can be done as well.\n\nI am guessing that technically an easy mode could increase the accessibility of a game, but I don't think it would help for players who can benefit from audio cues, visual cues, custom mapping or screen reading, and I think it wouldn't hurt for developers to take steps to include these people too without compromising the difficulty or vision of the game. Even without considering a disability, I have enjoyed game options that can be toggled to reduce motion sickness.\n\nI don't know where Eldin Ring stands on if it allows any of these kinds of accessibility features, but it would be nice to delineate different kinds of accessibility options rather than have the conversation be only about if there should be an easy mode (especially since mods on the PC versions of games and debug mode might can already do that for a game).",

            "From what I've played of it so far your extremely valid criticisms of ER's base game carried over to the DLC and then some. Bosses have a borderline comedic number of delayed attacks, animations are fucky and untrustworthy, and so on.\n\nI've had bosses animation cancel their recovery frames into a new attack chain so they're swinging 12 times without stopping, I've noticed weird issues where being able to parry depends on if your shield connects with the hand or the weapon (somehow *the hand* is the right answer, as if that makes sense), and pretty much everything from a basic footsoldier to every boss has delays built into their moveset.\n\nAlso the scaling is just as bad if not worse than it was in existing lategame areas. Pretty much everything with a named healthbar can 2- or 3-shot you even if you have the appropriate amount of upgrades and 60 vigor. And plenty of bosses have actual true combos, so getting hit by one attack can mean actually getting hit by 2-3 total. And at least one boss I've found has a grab that can OHK from full HP.\n\nI still think the game is great, but when normal respawning enemies simultaneously move faster and hit harder with longer attack chains than Friede, Gael, or even Orphan, something has gone wrong. Lategame ER was already an arms race between the devs and the player of who could make a more broken build, and that's only gotten more true.",
            "About your first point on animation delays and changes: I feel like it's a sort of arms race problem, though. Yes, this is definitely more common in Elden Ring and it's much harder to counter compared to Sekiro where you just spam block to parry weird animations. \n\nBut also, imagine if the animations were telegraphed as they were in Dark Souls 1. Every boss would be a piece of cake because we're already used to it, we know how the animations go, we can read it like a book. \n\nSo one option is to mess with your expectations by delaying or quickening the animations to force you to learn how the animation will go instead of simply reacting to it. \n\nIs it so different as to what games like Hollow Knight do? You can't predict what attacks will do before you see them at least once in that game. Same is true for many other games.\n\nMaybe there's a better option but right now I feel like people get frustrated because they can't simply walk to a boss and fall into that familiar dance where you walk around them, bait an attack, dodge, figure out if the attack has follow-ups, and then next time attack at the end of their attack. Rinse and repeat. Now, much like in Hollow Knight, you'll have to move in a very specific way to avoid attacks, not just rolling, but actively predicting what will happen based on experience of having your ass handed to you. And that's unfamiliar, but also more exciting if you open your mind to it.",

I rarely see people using them but there's some items that can turn certain encounters into something way easier (Frost pots for Malenia, Sleep pots for the Godskins, Bewitching Branches for anything that summons more enemies and so on) -- Sure, the games are genuinely difficult (at least imo, maybe I'm just getting older) but these are all things that can be done to make the experience better and far more approachable regardless of skill / willingness to invest time into the game",

If you get stuck on a boss in those games then you've really got three options, quit playing, lower the difficulty, or play the boss enough that you learn their patterns and eventually take them down. But that's not true with ER or Soulsborne games. If you're stuck on a boss then you can leave them alone for that time and explore a bit. In that exploration you may run into other bosses, and in doing that you may also find gear that'll help you against that boss you're stuck on. And all the while you're doing that, you're also learning the mechanics of the game more and leveling up your character in various ways. Then when you take another shot at that boss you may finally take them down. Through all of that you're to some degree lowering the difficulty.\n\nThat gets into what he mentions about breaking the game. A difficulty select means that people will rarely if ever get stuck on a boss. That in turn increases the possibility that they'll explore less because they aren't seeing any real resistance as they barrel through the critical path. So they never see most of the world, and all of the side content and bosses that the world has to offer. This is again something that isn't a concern for games like DMC or NG because there isn't much in the way of optional content. You're already going from Point A to Point B. So in that sense the game is being broken because it's de-incentivizing people from exploring the world.

You can learn Pathologic to the point where its structure becomes almost relaxing, but Elden Ring is so big that it's almost overwhelming. I struggle to pay attention to lore, details both visual and written because I'm barely surviving here. And that's fine for your first playthrough, it's necessary, even, but at some point you want to be able to take it easy enough to be able to start paying attention to detail, you know",

Even if you trivialize that portion of it, a disabled (or just bad) gamer could still find enjoyment in the environments, the dialogue, the voice acting, the quests, the character designs, the spectacle of the boss fights, the architecture, the story, the music, the sound effects...\n\nYou are reducing a massive, collaborative work of art down to timing some i-frames.

            "Why does it have to be an arms race? The goal isn't to be as challenging as humanly possible. The goal is to be well designed, reasonably challenging, and unique. Margitt was just stupid, even though I was strong enough to more or less melth through him by the time I got there. Which actually makes it less fun, because then I just try to cheese it or over level to get it over with. And, due to the open world approach it's probably the easiest From game, but outclassing them doesn't feel satisfying. And, I'm sure people do level 1 runs in Elden Ring but it's got to be the biggest pain in the ass of all the games I'd imagine. \n\nThe goal should be making you feel like \"man I really nailed it that time, I got him! Suck it!\" as you're dripping sweat and not \"Jesus Christ finally that cheap one shot kill didn't magically hit me this time\" or \"Good thing I spent an hour memorizing their entire moveset and planning what action to take for each one of them otherwise I'd have lost for the 60th time\"",
            "I feel like there are other alternatives to branching out the difficulty rather than just extending the combo lengths and having the enemies run on infinite stamina, I feel this because its already in ER.\n\nEven though I criticised Margitt for being the epitome of \"OH HERE IS MY ATTACK WIND UP ARE YOU READY HERE IT COMES I SWEAR THIS IS IT NO TAKE BACKSIES FOR REALISES THIS TIME SCOUTS HONOUR HERE IT COMES OH BOY IS THAT YOUR FACE GETTING READY FOR MY HAMMER HERE IT IS SPECIAL DELIVERY HERE IT COMES WHO ORDERED THE MCHAMMER AND CHEESE\" and goes on for another 5 seconds before making contact, he does have a cool lil way to mess with the player, his tail.\n\nThe classic method of \"roll into attack and stab enemy in butt\" can no longer be the main attack as he can be programmed to push back players using this. Its a minor example granted but this is sort of what I want when I want the games to get more difficult while still being interesting.\n\nExtending combos, delaying attacks to stupid degrees, giving enemies enlarged stamina regeneration and munching attack animations just come across as cheap to me in way I feel FROM is above.\n\nI'm not saying anything of the above cannot be done sparingly, unpopular opinion but while I do think there are faaaaaar too many of them, I like the Ulcerated Tree Spirit because of its hard to read animations.\n\nIts physical design looks like something that would writhe and roll in unpredictable ways, its feel natural.\n\nMargitt holding his hammer waiting for 10 seconds like hes about to play a game of whack a mole just looks really silly to me. I have been hit by it on more than one occasion not because I messed up the roll but because I just broke down laughing! Its absurd!\n\nAlso your example of Hollow Knight I don't think holds up because of the much more varied movement mechanics at your disposal, Elden Ring does not have this strength so the design of HK can afford to me a bit more sporadic.\n\nTime for a real bad take I'm sure will get me kicked off every FROM subreddit ever but lets be honest...FROM games (with the exception of Sekiro and thats BARELY) don't really have anything incredible in the combat department from a mechanical sense, it does the job but its carried from other much elements like level design and enemy animations.",
            "Yeah theres definitely a weird balance going on here. Dont do it and people just rush through the game. Anyone who has beaten Elden Ring can finish Dark Souls with like 10 deaths. 9 of those coming from Blighttown. \n\nIts definitely frustrating to some extent though. I dont mind some bosses having it to shake things up. But it feels like every boss in the DLC has some weird mixup where they do a 1 sec delay into a 3 sec delay into a 2 sec delay and it gets really confusing. Its especially annoying when some of their attacks are still lightning fast. So if the boss doesnt have very clear telegraphs, it just becomes a 50/50. You get used to it overtime with practice ofcourse. But i still think its a cheap way to inflate difficulty.",
            "Strong agree. I didn\u2019t find elden ring more difficult than earlier from games so much as I found the type of difficulty to be overly luck based and cheap. I love From\u2019s mechanics when the fight is against another individual enemy with abilities roughly comparable to the player. When the boss fights become more about groups of enemies, unbeatable timing, and massive unblockable attacks, that makes me feel more bored than challenged, so I pretty quickly bust out the blasphemous blade and a summon and power through.",

I don't think it is elitist to make that distinction of authorial intent, or at least not inherently elitist, as obviously there are souls snobs out there.",
            "I've been in love with the Soulsborne series since Demon's Souls and I honestly have a lot of problems with the way they've been tuning difficulty recently.\n\nGo play DS1 and compare it to Elden Ring. Playing Elden Ring without making a broken build or abusing summons is in a whole other league of difficulty compared to the old games. It's tuned for the sweatiest, high reaction speed players that were doing SL1 broken straight sword only runs in DS1.\n\nI can go on and on about how I think their design philosophy has changed, but what it really comes down to is that they're prioritizing difficulty to the detriment of \"fairness\". Enemies have extremely high mobility that's unmatchable by the player, non-stop combos that never leave a significant gap to retaliate, massive reach and AoE spam that makes it nearly impossible to gain distance for recovery, random delays and combo changes that make telegraphing unreadable, unbreakable poise when the player only gets hyperarmor that's very easily broken, massive health pools and enough damage to kill the player in 1-3 hits regardless of vitality and armor choices, dodging and retaliating based on input reading... There's an enemy in the DLC that reads your *camera position* to stay behind you at all times.\n\nThere are certainly enemies that are tuned more appropriately, but huge swaths of the game are just straight up not fun because of the enemies that aren't. On top of that, build variety is massively hindered by the necessity of dealing huge damage numbers *while* being fast (or ranged) enough to keep up with enemy combos. God forbid you try fat rolling.\n\nI still enjoy Elden Ring, don't get me wrong, but it's extremely frustrating at times. There are tons of places that I just run past enemies because it isn't worth trying to fight something that would have been a full boss in DS1 just to get to the next fog gate.",
            "Do fromsoft games get harder with every NG+ on the save file?",

I think base Elden Ring up to Morgott is easily the best game I've ever played, but after that it starts to slip as fights become more about avoiding OHK combos and making your own degenerate damage strat than ever. You can walk into Gael or Friede with nothing but an appropriately leveled straightsword and be fine, but I couldn't imagine doing that for any of these DLC bosses in ER.",
            ">The goal is to be well designed, reasonably challenging\n  \n  \nThe problem with these statements is that that's not coming from FromSoft. We have no idea what their design philosophy is, I believe the only metric they've ever spoken about is that Miyazaki has to be able to beat the boss by himself and beyond that we don't know what their goals are exactly.  \n  \n  \nPeople keep talking about \"balance\", but define balance. This isn't a fighting game or competitive FPS where we have metrics on win rates between guns and characters and we measure player skill via a ranking system. It's a player vs the game. And the game is one where items near a ledge goad you into picking it up without noticing the enemy who runs and pushes you off that ledge for an instakill. It's a game where rolling skeletons stunlock you into a frustrating death.\n  \n  \nWhen someone says a boss is too hard, we're saying that assuming the boss isn't exactly as hard as they intended. We're assuming they wanted a no bullshit fight and we don't know that's the case. We assume the experience they want to give is a fair 1v1, best man wins, but I would argue a fair amount of bosses show that not to be the case. In fact I think some of the world design shows that's not the case.",
            "That's certainly a hot take haha what games do you think have better combat under the same style compared to fromsoft games? So, what I'm getting at here is that if you say DMC, that's not a good answer because it's way more balls to the wall. What other game has a grounded, weighty fantasy combat better than Elden Ring?\n\nAnd yeah I agree that making us not roll to the butt is a great way to increase difficulty. But that's not enough. Do you have other examples? Cuz nothing comes to mind to me, which is at the heart of the problem I think.",
            "Yeah, if your boss fights are longer than 5 minutes you need more fiber in your diet.",
            "Correct. There is no real argument as to why a game can\u2019t have a pause feature when it\u2019s single player or a single player mode. It makes no difference in how good, bad, hard or easy a game is.",
            "Yeah pausing a boss mid animation in that game just meant I got to properly observe how I was about to die.",

            "Which absolutely sucks. The community went from \"jolly cooperation\" to \"if you summon, you didn't **really** win.",
            "I didn't know this either, so I went and looked it up. Apparently the easiest difficulty just lets you heal more from your 'estus flasks' and makes enemies deal less damage.\n\n...Which is *fantastic* and exactly what an easy mode should offer - the same core experience, but now letting you make a few more mistakes before you die.",
            "Seriously? How the fuck did you miss them?",
            "This happened to a streamer I was watching yesterday. They were trying to fight Mohg to enter the DLC, and spent maybe two hours repeatedly dying to him, until they whipped out the Mimic and promptly killed him with barely any input from his character. Dude ended stream feeling disappointed and like a cheater, lolol.",
            "using shitty summons is also a way to take aggro from yourself. balancing between keeping the summon alive and keeping yourself alive with low level summons is also an option. plus, crafting goes such a long way. the items arent like other rpg\u2019s, they genuinely give enough of a boost to change fights entirely. jumping instead of dodging, not using one build/weapon for everything because of weaknesses to poise or types of damage. \n\nthe dlc is hard as hell, but the base game can be made trivial with just a little effort.",
            "I can definitely understand that argument, but can I propose an alternative viewpoint?\n\nI think Dark Souls was never fair, and we just learned how to deal with it over the years. The combat system is based around fighting one person at a time with a lock-on system, and yet we faced multiple enemies at various points, notably bosses like ornstein and smough. We had to learn how to compensate for those enemies through the use of positioning, timing, and predicting their behavior, as well as using buffs. Not to mention the poison swamps, hidden enemies, mimic chests, etc. \n\nEventually, people became so good at those games that they could do it comfortably. Like, people saying DS1 is their comfort game that they play to chill and not get stressed. And it's not just the hardcore players, you can play it twice and it'll already be pretty easy on the third time unless you're doing NG+. But that's not because the game is fair, but because the environments and enemies become familiar to us. \n\nWhat is happening with Elden Ring is not really different from what happened with Dark Souls 1. We know the rhythms of combat now, we can predict how enemies fight based on DS 1, 2 and 3. We know the mimics, the poison swamps, and the hidden enemies. So FromSoft is trying to get us in other, new ways, while also offering new abilities to compensate for that. Yes, enemies are way quicker and trickier now, but you also have a variety of spells and ashes of war, and spirit ashes to help you avoid the bosses' attention. You can also craft items, I've avoided annoying boss fights simply by chucking bombs at them the whole time. \n\nNot to mention it's an open world game now, so balancing your own character compared to everything else is more important. If you're struggling, that means you should probably be stronger for that section.\n\nMy point is, Dark Souls was never about fair fights, you should fight dirty to win and Elden Ring will not treat you fairly because no FromSoft game ever did.",
            "Yes, everything gets way more HP and does more dmg, obviously if you're very familiar with the base game you have the knowledge to offset any huge difficulty gains because it's the same game, and you get better. But doing DLC on a NG+ save makes the bosses so tanky and deal significantly more dmg to you, and unfortunately now you don't have the knowledge to offset the difficulty spike.",
            "I wish you luck. The separate leveling system might be really helpful.",
            "[removed]",
            "Yup! Like others have said, I'm older now and don't have the time to play games like I used to. \n\nI feel like having a game with the same core experience but just allowing more mistakes is the perfect middle ground. It doesn't interfere with the team's vision but also allows us who don't have the same time we used to have a better chance at enjoying something.",
            "The way I see it, Dark Souls had a much more consistent rhythm to combat. Learn the rhythm, beat the enemy. That's what I mean by \"fair\".\n\n\nThere are certainly exceptions, I don't think DS1's balance is flawless, but even in the case of bosses like Ornstein and Smough that complicate things by adding a second enemy, there's still a lot of consistency in telegraphing and attack timing.\n\n\nI like a lot of the new mechanics in Elden Ring, but they require that enemies be tuned up to compensate for their inclusion, which means it's a lot harder to play without engaging those mechanics. It also means your build matters a lot more because you need to be able to keep up with the higher difficulty level of enemies.\n\n\nNone of that is inherently *bad*, but it is certainly *different*. It takes away from the slower, more methodical style I enjoyed in older games and makes for a more intense experience. It also makes death a lot more frustrating because there's often no takeaway other than \"this boss is too difficult for my current build\" or \"bad rng, better luck next time\".",
            "Not way more. It starts off at 10 percent, then increases by 5  for every cycle and stops at ng plus 7. Which at ng plus 7 is 40 percent more. It's noticeable but not insane thats why you still melt everything besides endgame in ng plus.",
            "I appreciate it. I'm sticking with lvl 150 but if I get frustrated I'll just farm to 200-300 so it doesn't get ridiculous.",
            "In a game where people stack vigor just enough to survive a big hit from a boss, adding +40% damage *is* insane.",
            "HP yes, but defenses also scale up at 10-20%, multiplicative so the effective change is bigger. NG+2 is still manageable but 3+ gets very hard, and if you're also playing a difficult DLC that you're going in blind on, well.... that's how you kill the fun\n\nHonestly though, with Respecs being a thing it shouldn't be 'that' bad to just make a new file rather than NG+ since you can easily mule stuff around, but anyone that goes past NG+ is probably in it for the difficulty anyway",
            "But that\u2019s after 7 additional cycles of the game, in theory you should be leveling up the whole time so you\u2019re still not getting one shot in ng 7"
