            "\"We're going to cut down this tree! Oh, please try to stop us. Oh, pretty please try.\" - The US.\n\nSeriously though, if I'd been a Korean trooper watching the US direct that many resources just to cut down a tree, I'd have serious second thoughts about partaking in the war.",
            "The\u00a0**Korean axe murder incident**\u00a0was the killing of two\u00a0[United Nations Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Command)\u00a0officers, Captain Arthur Bonifas and First Lieutenant Mark Barrett, by North Korean soldiers on August 18, 1976, in the\u00a0[Joint Security Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Security_Area)\u00a0(JSA) in the\u00a0[Korean Demilitarized Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone)\u00a0(DMZ). The officers, from the United States Army, had been part of a work party cutting down a poplar tree in the JSA.\n\nThree days later, US and South Korean forces launched\u00a0**Operation Paul Bunyan**, an operation that cut down the tree with a show of force to intimidate North Korea into backing down, which occurred.\n\nOperation Paul Bunyan was carried out on August 21 at 07:00, three days after the killings. A convoy of 23 American and South Korean vehicles (\"Task Force Vierra,\" named after\u00a0[Lieutenant Colonel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Colonel)\u00a0Victor S. Vierra, commander of the United States Army Support Group) drove into the JSA without any warning to the North Koreans, who had one observation post staffed at that hour. In the vehicles were two eight-man teams of military engineers (from the\u00a0[2nd Engineer Battalion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_Engineer_Battalion_(United_States)), 2nd Infantry Division) equipped with\u00a0[chainsaws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainsaw)\u00a0to cut down the tree.\n\nThe teams were accompanied by two 30-man security platoons from the Joint Security Force, who were armed with pistols and axe handles. The 1st Platoon secured the northern entrance to the JSA via the Bridge of No Return, while the 2nd Platoon secured the southern edge of the area.\n\nConcurrently, a team from B Company, commanded by Captain Walter Seifried, had activated the detonation systems for the charges on\u00a0[Freedom Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imjingak)\u00a0and had the\u00a0[165mm main gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Ordnance_L9)\u00a0of the\u00a0[M728 combat engineer vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M728_Combat_Engineer_Vehicle)\u00a0aimed mid-span to ensure that the bridge would fall if the order was given for its destruction. Also, B Company, supporting E Company (bridge), were building M4T6 rafts on the\u00a0[Imjin River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imjin_River)\u00a0if the situation required emergency evacuation by that route.\n\nIn addition, a 64-man task force of the\u00a0[ROK Army 1st Special Forces Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Special_Forces_Brigade_(South_Korea))\u00a0accompanied them, armed with clubs and trained in\u00a0[taekwondo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo), supposedly without firearms. However, once they parked their trucks near the Bridge of No Return, they started throwing out the sandbags that lined the truck bottoms and handing out\u00a0[M16 rifles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M16_rifle)\u00a0and\u00a0[M79 grenade launchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M79_grenade_launcher)\u00a0that had been concealed below them.[^(\\[4\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_axe_murder_incident#cite_note-2koreas-4)\u00a0Several of the commandos also had\u00a0[M18 Claymore mines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M18_Claymore_mine)\u00a0strapped to their chests with the firing mechanism in their hands, and were shouting at the North Koreans to cross the bridge.",

Asshole in charge Park Chung-hee figured out that it is much easier to build a pile of guns if you have a strong economy to make them, and launched reforms to build a strong economy so he doesn\u2019t have to keep asking Uncle Sam for more guns. This led to the Miracle on the Han River where South Korean living standards surged far past North Korean standards.  \n\nBy the 90\u2019s, South Korea went from a poor tinpot dictatorship reliant on foreign aid for survival to a massively wealthy democracy exporting decent manufactured goods and services across the world and was about to unleash K-pop on the world. Meanwhile, North Korea saw their Soviet sugar daddy suffer a self-inflicted case of existence failure and all they had to show for it was a massive pile of guns very similar to the ones that Uncle Sam and friends just turned into scrap metal in Mesopotamia. \n\nThat\u2019s when the famine and suffering really starts for North Korea.",

Some seriously angsty shit apparently.\u00a0\n\nAside: Isaac Stevens was interesting in his own right, but I want to point out he named his kid Hazard.

Vicksburg and even the Overland Campaign show how much of a master of maneuver Grant was.\u00a0\n\nAlso, wasn\u2019t Grant as good at McClellan at logistics, if not even better considering how much more intensive his campaigns were?\n\nAnd yeah living sure beats dying, but even if a bullet doesn\u2019t get us, even a tiny splinter might lmao, disease was rampant, it just sucked to live back then",
            "Kind of, but you also had a period of enlistment. Most troops weren\u2019t serving for duration. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s hard to say who the troops preferred. There are tons of first hand accounts during and after the war. Many certainly liked Grant because he won and troops want to win. That said, people often forget that the \u201cGrant the Butcher\u201d sobriquet wasn\u2019t given to him by the Confederates, nor did it refer to how many rebels he killed. I\u2019d imagine that the Union troops who coined that nickname weren\u2019t too fond of him. Then again, it\u2019s also possible that opinions changed over time. In the same way that many soldiers who complained about \u201cGranny Lee\u201d in 1861-62 came to eventually sing his praises, it\u2019s possible that many Union soldiers called him a butcher during the war also changed over time. When those soldiers looked back and saw that being part of the Army of the Potomac when it defeated the Army of Northern Virginia was the defining moment in their lives, they probably viewed Grant more favorably. \n\nMcClellan had the opposite happen. He was hugely popular with his men, but he looks much worse in hindsight. Then the fact that he ran against Lincoln further tarnished his reputation. It\u2019s worth pointing out that just as the Lost Causers slandered and attacked the legacies of Southerners who went on to become Republicans (like Longstreet and Mosby), so too did pro-Union historians write more critically of Northern Democrats, like McClellan.",
            "Grant was an excellent logistician, but I don\u2019t know if he was an institutionally gifted as McClellan. Grant sustained a huge army in the field, but McClellan basically built the system that made it possible. \n\nAs for maneuver, McClellan was too fancy for his own good. Because he always overestimated rebel numbers, he constantly tried to outmaneuver them. When he felt he could not gain a position of advantage, he often withdrew (as evidenced in the abortive Peninsular Campaign). Grant was excellent and coordinating the movement of vast numbers and even conducting joint operations with the Navy, but his maneuver was usually pretty linear. That isn\u2019t a criticism. If McClellan had gone full speed ahead like Grant typically did, he probably would have broken through Macgruder\u2019s force and into Richmond by \u201862. \n\nThat said, I\u2019d still rather march and counter march trying to find some mythical gap in the line under McClellan than smash through the Wilderness, the Bloody Angle, and Cold Harbor under Grant.",

            "I think your grossly underestimating the german military in ww2 man. The allies won through a mix of better tactics, skill, and in the end sheer fucking numbers.\n\nThe tiger was the undisputed champion of tanks in ww2, but that didn't matter when the western front had five to six shermans for each german tank(not just the tigers), and could easily and consistently replace them. And on the eastern front you have the soviets projectile vomiting t34's and a few IS-1 AND IS-2's at the germans (plus more shermans from lend lease)\n\nIt was the same in the air. The germans had the BF109, as well as the Fuke-Wulf. They created Air to Surface missiles, and pioneered CAS. (Although the allies copied and improved on what the ger.ans did). The only plane in the early war that could keep up with germany was the P51, and that is the same story as the tanks. We just spammed P51's until the germans couldn't see anything else, and gave every plane we weren't actively using to the soviets or brits.\n\nAnd on the seas was no different.  The U-boats kept the allies from operating at full capacity for a damn good chunk of time, and forced the allies to completely change how the approached naval warfare in the Atlantic.  We had to develop new radars and depth charges to combat the U-boats.\n\nAnd most Americans were deathly afraid of german equipment.  The MG34 and Tigers above the rest, allied tankers were constantly alert for any german soldiers with a panzerfaust. Why? Because they knew that the german army was a proper fighting force. And to sit there and say that they weren't,  is an insult to all the heroes who died on the beaches.  Who died in France, in Belgium,  in Italy,  all those who died above the skies of London, and every soldier who fought, to end the threat of Nazi Germany. \n\nGermany lost by the fact that they were outnumbered,  and in the end outskilled. As Roman said: \"men. You have fought like loins, and have been led by donkeys\"",

So they just turned back home earlier. Afterwards the german fighters came and attacked the bomber formations. German Flak also did its part after the axis fighters left. Both caused high losses in the daylight bombing campaign of the americans as the meme references.\nBut just as u/Intrepid00 said, it got better, the nearer the end of the war got. Other factors that haven't been mentioned for higher allied bomber surivival rate nearing the end of the war are the following:\n1. After the introduction of the P51 Version D Mustang there was a fighter plane that had the range to follow american bomber formations the whole way through their missions deep into German territory. (most important factor for increasing range and performance was using the british merlin engine in the american warplane frame)\n2. After D-Day gaining allied ground in continental europe shortened the length of bombing missions significantly. The shorter flight path also enabled other fighter plane models with less range to escort the bombers the whole way through.\n\nHope this explains the meme pal u/Goh2000",
