Check out the most recent patch notes on the sidebar!\n\n**What is a simple question?** Typically, we define a simple question as something that can be answered fully within a single, or maybe two at most, comments. In this thread, you can ask any question you need answered about League of Legends, **even if it isn't necessarily about learning the game itself.**\n\nQuestions about what champ to add to your pool or general tip about roleswapping can also be asked in this thread.\n\n*Keep in mind we will still continue to remove golden rule violations, rants, memes, topics against Riot's ToS, and paid services - but the other rules are generally more lax here.*\n\n**What you can do to help!**\n\nFor now, this is a patch-based thread, meaning it will be posted once every two weeks. Checking back on this thread later in the patch and answering any questions that have been posted would be a huge help!\n\nIf you're trying to ask a question, the more specific you are, the better it is for all of us!

It should also be mentioned that it is just in the quanity of CS, but networth-wise I am either on my level or even above. Therefore I feel I am not getting punished as much as I think I should be.

            "How do I beat (a good) Sett as a melee (as Garen) without junglers help? Problem is, that he is pretty decent/good in teamfights with his ult. While I feel useless. I asked a friend and he says sett is a fair champ and that I just need to get better at Garen. I watched some youtube videos about Garen vs Sett Matchup but most of them seems like waiting for jungler or waiting for huge mistakes by the Sett player. I am around High Emerald/low Diamond elo.\n\nOfc I know the basics, slow push, wave advantage, ability cd abuse. But the Sett players that I fight don't care at all for my huge minions wave and just walk into me use there cc to easy land there big W. Its hard to avoid his stun of E If u have to contest minion wave. This would mean I can never ever fight in minions and have to let him do whatever he wants with my wave. I am not talking about bad Sett players who walk under my tower and eat free shots, I am talking about players who knows how wave control works and just farm up and keep me down. And after like 10 minutes just tower dive me.\n\nThe best I can do is go even. But that is really bad, because he is much more valuable in teamfights and I cant really match him until he makes big mistakes with his E and W.\n\nSo how can I beat (good) Sett players? Bad Setts just waste their W or use It without E, this makes It easy to dodge.",
            "Why was changing corki from ap to ad and removing the packet passive and instead buffing his basic abilities enough to make him picked mainly in bot now instead of mid (both for pro and soloq)?\n\nLike, his playstyle is pretty similar except for the package. He uses his basic abilities the same way and his ult is the same too, same aa range I think and so on. So why did no one play him bot before and why is almost everyone now playing him bot instead of mid?\n\nLike mages have always been viable bot, so it can't just be the ap to ad switch, right? You could play mages before that build ap on botlane and Tristana is played mid as an ad marksmen like Corki is now, so why this drastic role switch for Corki?\n\nIs it just placebo/trendy and he is actually just as viable bot and mid as Tristana and he was just as viable bot before the \"rework\" just like a lot of other \"mage/ap\" champs are? Or is there actually reasons for this big role swap?",

            "I just played a game where my Nautilus was standing in the back of the baron pit. He was the closest champion to baron and he was autoing it. We got wiped after that, but our jungler (already low HP) chastised the Nautilus for not tanking the baron, saying that you have to be in front of it to tank the autos.\n\nIt's my understanding that you can be anywhere in the pit as long as you are closest to baron, but I didn't argue much because I realized I'm not 100% sure about that. Can anyone verify which is true? Is it possible that the new barons are different in this regard?",

            "Just had a thought about manipulating MMR in Diamond+\n\nCould one theoretically boost their MMR by (hopefully) only winning a game that would promote you to D4 and then allowing decay to bring you back to E1? Ideally you'd then win the next game to bring you back into D4, back into a decayable rank (and increasing MMR by winning) and then by decaying you won't lose MMR via losing a game.\n\nOr would this quickly become irrelevant if your MMR gets too high for the visual rank?",

However, like certain fighting games, I often spend too much time thinking about who I want to play, rather than learning/playing the game properly. Currently been playing characters on the free trial as I slowly grab all the junglers, but no one really stands out since everyone is fun in their own way. Also since I'm currently bad at the game & trying to improve, I'm most likely looking at champions the wrong way",

My strongest suit would be that I'm pretty good analytically. I love learning about characters stat's and sort of predicting how to properly play a match up. Knowing what counters what, and playing around that.

Even against a half hp enemy if I got all in they can make it even by killing me too.   \nI end up being even on farm which is not good on sivir, I should out farm my enemy.\n\nHow should I play?

Also I feel more helpless than usual in games where the team is struggling and behind. Sometimes people just get oneshot even when I shield them in time.

I mean for example I really like velkoz, killing someone with angles in lane feels very satisfying and it takes a lot of skill, but he\u2019s not that impactful later (as azzapp said, and I noticed it too).

            "There are two types of roams: ganking another lane and rotating to objectives/jungle fights/placing vision. \n\nA roam to another lane is close to the bottom of your priorities most of the time. The list will usually be\n\n1) do I have to fix the wave \n2) can I kill my laner\n3) can I get a tower\n4) can I /do I need to get a safe recall without losing waves or anything else on the map\n5) can I roam without losing anything\n5a) is the roam likely to work\n6) can I get plates\n7) can I steal jungle camps\n\nThis is a rough example, but basically: you want to get yourself ahead without danger, and most roams to other lanes are very uncertain in outcome. You either get a kill (win), play fizzles out/no one dies or uses anything (time lost) or enemies turn it (massive loss). Only roam when higher order questions are all no, as all these options are higher reward with lower risk. Even dying to your laner in a close duel in point 2 would lead to them having to recall, so only you lose on it - dying on a roam will put you AND laner/s you roamed to behind. This is also why Katarina, Malzahar, Zed etc. Fall off in higher elos - they cannot reliably roam/secure a lane state to make the roam worth it and enemies will respect their roams more.\n\nRoams to allied fights/objectives are on the other hand high on priority. You are not initiating a play, you're reacting to an ongoing situation - guranteed action without waiting around, and it will 99% of the time be within 10 seconds of walking instead of nearly 20 seconds of sidelanes. Additionally roaming to an ally will create/even out numbers advantage on a play calculated to work without that extra body , greatly increasing chances of success. Annie doesn't want to gank enemy Janna/Draven with allied Sona/Zeri, but absolutely does want to collapse on enemy half HP Draven chasing low HP ally in river for a free snack literally coming to her. The difference is action is guranteed in the latter, and situation is calxulated by enemies based on Annie not coming, so her coming dlips enemy's plans. \n\nTl;dr only roam to guranteed plays, focus on more reliable sources of income and XP to gurantee power in mid/lategame big fights.",

I would only help my team with early to midgame fights if there is something in it for me like killing my laner so I can farm more, getting a double or triple kill, etc. In Vladimir\u2019s case, you could reach a decent rank without ever having to learn how to roam/gank, because Vladmir\u2019s goal in every game is to reach level 16 with 3 completed items and completely 1v5 carry teamfights",

Draven has the lead on the surface, but if Aphelios is level 16 with 3 items then actually HIS team is way more likely to win fights because of how insanely good Aphelios is late game. Team compositions is also a factor; one team might be way ahead on paper, but if the losing team has high impact ultimates like Wukong R, Malphite R, etc. then all it takes is one good teamfight for the losing team to come from behind and win the game. As you learn new champions, I would check their statistics on websites like lolalytics.com to see at what stage of the game they are most effective.",

So you could just compare how many items each player have or like if you are top then compare enemy items and yours.

So in that case Vayne is actually winning and Lucian is losing (taken in isolation from the rest of the game).",
            "So on ranged squishy mages, often you don't really want to be buying full defensive items.  \n\nEven if you buy an armor item, lets say deadman's plate---if the enemy AD assassin/bruiser gets on top of you, you're still going to die.  But what's worse is you spent all that money on a defensive item, and now don't have the damage to ever kill them.  \n\nIn general positioning IS your defense.  You don't want to be getting dove by them in the first place.  I know this is difficult for a less experienced player though.  Zhonya's is generally the most efficient secondary defensive option, which is also hard to use.  Before fights you would want to think, I Zhonya's X so you're mentally prepared to press it (i.e. zed ult, jarvan dive).  \n\nHp + Ap items might be a better route for you to build more \"defensively\" so you don't get instantly bursted.  \n\nAs an example, Syndra is normally built straight glass cannon, like ludens -> shadowflame -> deathcap.  You've got massive damage, but if you get hit you die.  \n\nThere is a more \"battle mage\" style build though that's viable, but not popular.  In this build you go something along the lines of Rod of the Ages -> Cosmic Drive -> Shadowflame/deathcap.  In this setup, you also run double scaling hp runes.  So what ends up happening is you get a ton of flat hp from RoA, you get a bonus level for even more after RoA stacks, you've got double stacked hp runes.  An assassin jumps on you, you live at like 30% hp, CC him, and then your team blows him up.  You also have more haste, so you can be casting your spells more often.  \n\nThis setup won't work as well with characters like Ahri/Lux, but at a casual level it can help you actually \"play the game\" and give you more margin for error before the enemy dive champs are too fed to even contest.  \n\nFor Lux perhaps try a Archangel (gives shield when low when stacked) -> Cosmic Drive build.  I've tried something similar in the past and found it quite fun to play, having higher haste than normal.  Ahri I'm less familiar with.  The Syndra build is probably workable, but you won't ever have much kill threat on your own (which is probably okay if you're less experienced, you just team fight and hit who you can).\n\nAery - Manaflow/Transcendance/Scorch or Gathering + Magic Boots/Triple Tonic for the Syndra build.  Syndra in particular really likes the RoA level+ and the triple tonic skill point as it stacks her passive faster, so she scales fast with this setup.",

Not to mention, having package meant that he was more level-reliant, and needed tankier stats to be able to make package plays.\n\nCorki's AD conversion and new passive pushes him towards Lethality and Crit builds, meaning that levels aren't nearly as important for him. He was also given less rockets, meaning that he couldn't proc the same items as often, which he did in mid lane.

You can't improve if you're doing game after game, not watching back your games and trying to learn where you may have gone wrong. 3 games a day max is what I'd recommend firstly.

If enemies don't have any mobile threats (mostly assassins and duelists) then you can splitpush on any ADC because they can't catch you that easily.\n\nIf you assess the situation and decide that you absolutely can't sidelane this game, your best bet is to group with team for a fight and then move back to sidelane to catch farm when wave bounces back, or farm jungle camps if there's no fight.",

They scale very well, but if you fall behind early, you're screwed. \n\nSecondly, unless you are playing in high GM lobbies, you can never truly be \"so far behind\". You have to play league like it is a single player game if you want to climb. You take all the kills and all the farm. All the gold should go to you.

Ignore your teammates and all the random things that they are doing. Go for plays that YOU think will give you the best outcome. If I go and I play in emerald lobby as a GM player, I'm not going to listen to pings that my teammates are throwing at me, since I know that what I'm doing is a better play. I'm not saying this to boost my ego, I'm saying this to hopefully help you understand the mindset that you need to have if you truly want to climb and get to any rank you want.

I think on Ahri I rely too much on Malignance as a first item for the haste on my R, as it seems so crucial to her playstyle. But on Lux maybe the Archangel route could be worth a try.",
            "I\u2019ll have to look, probably don\u2019t want to do that though. I think I\u2019ll just have to get used to it",

            "So heal cut and don't fight",
            "Also experiment with conqueror and phase rush. Conqueror makes you way stronger earlier and with ignite it makes garen a pretty scary level one champ. I\u2019m not sure if it would beat sett level one but it should make it at least even with an e start.",
            "ah okay, that make sense then",
            "Oh okay, thanks for the answer. I guess he might still see some play mid tho, kinda like tristana even tho his main role is gonna be bot?",
            "A good response. What would you say you do about slumps? I just got demoted to Bronze III and I feel like a failure.",
            "Thank you = )",
            "Thanks for the insight. I usually never play this many games, but I was completely free these past couple days so I basically spent all my time on ranked lol\n\n  \nI realize that the champ pool may seem large, but I've played these champs all in the past (at least old m7) in ranked. I'm generally plat when playing adc so not to sound egotistical, I feel like Im better than 90% of the silver players mechanically. \n\n  \nIdk though tbh I'm the one on the losing streak after all lol",
            "appreciate the reply, this should help! thank you!",
            "First game I tried it last night on Jinx, won't do it again. The 1 item spike really did feel good and I had IE very early but still fell off with it I think.\n\nAs far as Kaisa goes it seems to work out though. Kraken and pickaxe for Q evolve is pretty solid.\n\nFor that game I think I really did need merc and cleanse.",
            "I'd advise against learning support first, learn mid or top.",
            "I have learned only JNGL and ADC so far, does it mean I dont have to learn role fundamentals for the others anymore?",
            "Mid plays completely different than sidelanes because it's so short and open. Botlane plays completely different than top because it has twice as many players in it and is much more gankable due to different terrain.\n\nThe only thing that stays the same is lasthitting but how you control waves, trade, roam, position etc. is all different.",
            "I'm thinking about playing jungle and mid. I do think these roles do compliment each other though I never learned properly how to play mid. I carry most of my games as an ADC but it feels like day and night if I switch back to jungle and I kind of lose my pace. Lmaoo maybe I'm being delusional and its just my mindset, what do I know.",
            "I see, thanks! I will try to capitalize on those strengths.",
            "What ADCs are building 2 Zeal items? I always thought you only ever built one because you\u2019re gimping your damage otherwise.",

            "Thank you too! I'll give them all a few games :)",
            "Yes completely random",
            "oh yeah ik what i wanna play, and my only real problem is csing so i dont really aram would help with that that much, but ty for the answer",
            "Thing is, nobody is forcing you to complete a single item. Kraken is 50 AD, 40% attack speed, 7% movespeed and the 3-hit passive for 3100 gold. BF Sword+Zeal+2 daggers is 40 AD, 35% attack speed, 15% crit chance and 5% movespeed for 3000 gold.\n\nKraken only outperforms IE+Zeal item as a 1-item powerspike and it's mostly because of the 3-hit passive. From 2 items onwards it's dogwater compared to just going straight crit because it takes forever to get IE+LDR+Zeal item, and it leaves you no slot for a defensive item.",
            "Thank you so much!! Last night was my first game back in LoL in a long time (Non ARAM/Non-Bots).  It was just a normal, but I went Mundo into Darius.   If I didn't know better your explanation was as if you were narrating my match! I got beat well early - but only gave up one lane death - and ended up going 6/3/11 to Darius's 2/5/0 (and I beleive AFKd at the end).  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt felt 'good/right', but I wanted to be sure my early game should have been that 'tough' - I do need to learn to farm under tower better, I did 'okay', but he was way up on CS.",
            "I dont vibe with either of these ap champs sadly. Maybe morde? Does he scale well? Are there other good AP options?",
            "The problem is its neither right now. its like hitting 18 then finding out ur mom used ur social to open all these accounts and ur in debt",
            "i got down voted by the random bronze fake d4s lol",
            "Randuins best vs crit but if you just want 1 item and they have many high AS champs frozen heart wins",
            "Ehhh, tbh.. Not really. Tristana is played mid lane because she has high burst damage and kill pressure. She is an assassin/marksman hybrid, and can capitalize on any gank. With the removal of Corki\u2019s AP and some of his rockets, Riot pretty much killed poke Corki, but his all-in isn\u2019t strong enough to 100-0 someone. If you go all-in, you won\u2019t have the burst damage to kill someone, and then you lack escape options assuming you used your W. Tristana, on the other hand, gets resets. This allows her to jump in, get the kill, then safely jump OUT.",
            "This is a really hard question to answer because I don't know what exactly you understand under role fundamentals. But generally you don't need to be able to play all roles to climb. Playing only jungle and adc is just fine.\n\nFundamentals like trading and positioning work just the same in other lanes, the champions are just different. The same goes for things like wave control and roaming.",
            "It works exactly the same. You might want to do different things but the fundamentals remain the same.\n\nFor example if you know how and why you freeze a wave, regardless of lane, then you will know when you should freeze. What lane you play doesn't matter for that. Freezes are more useful top than mid but the reason stays the same.\n\nRoaming is the same. You want to roam when you have your opponent pushed in so you don't lose any minions. Doesn't matter if you're top or mid or support. The situation is the same.\n\nThat's why they are called fundamentals.They are fundamental to your game, regardless of what role you play. Of course there are different situations in the lanes but fundamentals are universal and help you master all situations.",
            "ah im thinking of kraken/shiv/botrk, so non crit items that give good damage early",
            "As an adc main, if the enemy assassin is fed you just have to wait for a missplay on his part. Don't overextend past your turrets except if you are with someone. Wait for them to come to you. Watch where your teammates are going. If they don't leave you the midwave, try to get bot or topwave. Try to ping your team to catch enemies. If you are behind you need to get picks. Don't fight drake unless you are on a powerspike or it is soul. They can't end if you don't take a 5vs5 unless they get baron. Get blue ward (farsight alteration) and ward baron if you think they might be on it. But even then, if they get 2 picks and then turn baron it might be impossible to fight it. Maybe you can crossmap and take a tower. But then again it all depends on teamcomps.",
            "Fizz can struggle vs bruisers, but he counters any mage/adc mid laner after lvl 6 and later. Even vs bruisers, you can still win 1v1s, but you will have to play slowly and go for burst fights, meaning you do your burst with Q+AA+W and you E out and wait for your cooldowns. If you want to learn him go on youtube and type \"lol mango fish montage\" and watch how this guy plays.",
            "I realize I already answered but Nautilus is like this too. \n\nBoth being melee tank supports, in lane you need to avoid poke while picking your spots for a hard engage. you can play more defensively in team fights. Naut is a hook champ while Leona is the inverse, her E puts her on top of the target.",
            "Glad you are back to playing! Sounds like you played it totally how it should have been played. Let me know if you have any other questions or need any help!",
            "Akali, Voli, Gwen, Morde, Vlad, Kayle, Cassio are some that come to mind.",
            "Gotcha, yea that would make it harder for him to be played mid.",
            "He really is an inspiration. Yeah I've played vs an Urgot mid lol and I played the slow game and won vs him in lane so hard he rushed Maw",
            "Thank you for the further insight... I've thought about nautilus before but never took the plunge, let's do it :)",
            "Thanks. Last time I really played ranked, um 2017?, I used to be Jungle(main)/Support.  I've read jungle is not in a great spot, so I'm doing tankier Top/Support Pics. Mundo my top main (as OTP as I can for a while) and support will probably roll with Nautalis (my old support main) and want to use Braum as a secondary. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Question would be:**  Who would be good 'backups' other candidates for tanky Top/Support if I can't get Mundo/Naut? \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks.",
            "I think Jungle is totally fine if that is what you enjoy. Just whatever you\u2019ll like most! As far as backups go, Skarner is a really good place since the rework and can be played both top and support. Zac is kind of an unconventional fun take you could try out too also. Braum as you mentioned sounds great as a secondary. You could also try out Leona if you like engaging like on Nautilus.",
            "Of course - Leona - duh!  And thanks, I just watched a PekinWoof vid on Skarner...but he makes most things look easy so wasn't sure. I might just keep Garen in back pocket...or while I'm in low elo - Malphite. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for the thoughts!"

            "I think that Vanguard totally bricked my laptop. It won't start and I can't use it anymore.\n\nFor context, I was in an Arena game yesterday when I had a Vanguard error that said \"Vanguard needs to be running in order to play League\". I pressed OK and it closed my client. I tried launching the client again but couldn't reconnect to the game as the same error would appear as soon as I joined. I noticed Vanguard was active in my system tray so I thought \"weird, guess I'll just restart the laptop.\"\n\nIt turned off and now will not start at all. Pressing the power button only turns on the USB ports LEDs. Screen stays black, fans don't start spinning, and even the power button LED is off.\n\nSo far, I've tried:\n- accessing the BIOS upon pressing the power button. Nothing happened, no sound. Screen is off so I can't even be sure if didn't work. \n\n- resetting my BIOS. I disconnected my laptop main battery as well as the CMOS battery, then for two minutes did a bunch of holding the power button for 10 seconds before releasing it. I waited an hour before assembling it back but laptop still wouldn't start.\n\nAs of now, I called a Lenovo technician this morning. He doesn't believe Vanguard has anything to do with it, and offered to replace the motherboard. Would that even help? \n\nI apologise for the length of my message but am really desperate to find a fix.

This means I\u2019m constantly sending skill shots backwards, or I\u2019m just walking into the enemy team because my champion just keeps walking forward. \n\nI\u2019ve already gotten rid of MSI AB, rivatuner, EVGA precision, I\u2019ve closed as many things off task manager as I can. I\u2019ve checked the network logs and they show no ping spikes or packet loss. They do show some jitter, but in the area of 3-6ms, not full seconds. \n\nI cannot play the game in its current state.

            "seems like you have the one case that was addressed in detail by riot\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAbout \\~0.7% of the playerbase bypassed Microsoft\u2019s enforcement for TPM 2.0 when they installed Windows 11, but the rollout of Vanguard requires that those players\u00a0[now enable it to play the game](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/24170417829651-How-to-Fix-Error-VAN9001-by-Enabling-TPM-2-0-Win-11-Only). This requires a change to a BIOS setting, which differs based on the manufacturer. Vanguard does not and cannot make changes to the BIOS itself.\n\nBIOS settings can be confusing, and we\u2019ve seen two niche cases where it\u2019s created an issue.\n\nThe first is that many manufacturers prompt a switch to UEFI mode when TPM 2.0 is enabled, but if the existing Windows 11 installation is on an MBR partition, it would become unbootable afterwards. Some OEMs support LegacyBoot mode with TPM 2.0, but to support UEFI mode, Windows 11 must be installed on a GPT partition.\u00a0[Microsoft has a guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/disk-management/change-an-mbr-disk-into-a-gpt-disk)\u00a0and a\u00a0[helpful tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/mbr-to-gpt)\u00a0that can help avoid a reformat and reinstall if you\u2019re in this scenario.\n\nThe second was a player we spoke to that accidentally also enabled SecureBoot with a highly custom configuration. While Vanguard makes use of the SecureBoot setting on VALORANT, we elected not to use it for League, due to the older hardware that comprises its userbase. Older rigs can have compatibility issues with this setting, and that\u2019s actually one of the primary reasons the Vanguard launch was delayed.\n\nFor example, some GPUs are known to have Option ROM that is not UEFI SecureBoot capable (especially older cards), and sometimes this can result from players having flashed it themselves to \u201cunlock\u201d the card. If the Option ROM isn\u2019t signed, enabling SecureBoot would prevent your GPU from rendering anything (since it won\u2019t boot), resulting in a black screen. There would be two ways to fix this: Connect the monitor to an integrated graphics card (if you have one) and then disable SecureBoot in BIOS. Remove your CMOS battery to reset back to default settings.\n\n**TL;DR - We DO NOT require SecureBoot for League of Legends. Don\u2019t enable it unless you are sure you want to.**\n\n  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*",
            "It bricked your laptop prob. When you agreed to League of Legends TOS you have (most likely unknowingly) agreed to their arbitration agreement. That means that you can't sue them in court. What is also means is that you can use their agreement to force them into arbitration, which will cost riot probably a minumim of $10,000 to $15,000 dollars, even if they beat you completely uncontested. Because of this, if you force them into arbitration by filing a form with the AAA (American Arbitration Association) for a measly few hundred bucks, Riot would be legally bound to uphold their end of the agreement which includes paying for the Arbitration fees, which typically range from $10-15k. The first set of fees comes after the initial \"settlement\" period is over... Basically once you have decided you are unwilling to take their settlement offer. Once you decline they will have to pay roughly $4,500. Due to this they will offer to settle for 2-3k. The entire process will take you 30ish days, approx 2-4 hrs of your time and net you enough $ to buy a new laptop. Your Welcome.",

            "To add to your comment because this issue is super common and it's caused by different apps, not only ultraview.\n\nIf someone is presenting the same issue described here, it could be caused by an app that creates some sort of overlay or any app that tries to inject themselves into executables. Vanguard then recognize this as malicious and it doesn't let you play.\n\nThe way I found the culprit (In my case it was a [unknown small app I used to keep random windows on top](https://github.com/navossoc/MenuTools)), is by going to the task manager and closing every background process [under this section](https://i.imgur.com/Z9xoagH.jpeg), these are usually non-essentials; I went to a game after that and checked if I was still freezing. I was not, so the only thing left was to identify which one of those apps is making Vanguard go haywire. \n\nIf the app is an overlay thing like rivatuner, then you might need to close it before opening the game. But if the app is a sort of injector, you can go directly into the game and then close the app from the task manager, the game then will unfreeze. This is useful to know to identify the culprit.\n\n---\n\n**So to debug this type of issue I recommend:**\n\n1) Go to task manager, close every app under \"background Processes\" umbrella. Some will reopen again but these are usually windows processes that are probably not the culprit.\n\n2) Go to the game and see if the issue persist\n\n3.1) if it doesn't persist, then restart the machine so you can test from in-game with all the suspect processes opened in order to identify which app is the one ramming heads with Vanguard. Go to step 4.\n\n3.2) if it persists, then your issue is not one of those apps. It might be something essential like a driver, or a windows thing (can't help you there)\n\n4) Go into the game where you are frozen in place, then open the task manager and try closing the apps you closed before 1 by 1 until you unfreeze. This happens immediately if it's an injector, so you can close one app and check league, and repeat until you find the app that's creating the issue.\n\n5) In the case you don't find the app after doing this, the software is probably a pre-overlay. So try any software that creates some sort of overlay across any other app, like discord, rivatuner, gpu filters. You can try closing 5 apps at the time and the opening a game to see if you can identify the culprit this way.\n\nAfter identifying, you can choose between uninstalling, closing before opening league, or reporting to riot to see if they can patch that issue.",

        "content": "Disclaimer: Maining Lillia, a champ with bad ganks pre-6 and probably the worst tower diving for a melee champion because dots trigger tower shots isn't ideal for this. But in my experience, ganking bot feels often just way less consistent than ganking top.\nI wanna play devil's advocate here and argue why I personally prefer ganking top over bot and then I want you to explain to me why I am probably wrong lol.\n\nWhy I am ganking top:\n\nTop is less volatile, but one kill can potentially snowball harder.\n\nI don't know if it is just me, but it feels like in almost every game bot lane is just a constant Massacre. They are fighting, like, ALL THE TIME, and if there isn't like ten deaths before ten minutes,  it's a pure farm lane where nobody is in a good position to be ganked. This is due to the existence of the support, which can enable or disable fighting depending on the pick. Hook and engage supports are obviously more deadly than enchanters.\nTop is a different story. Usually there is one guy completely dominating the other and pushing him extremely hard into the tower, which is usually a perfect gank setup (btw I am playing in low Elo and people don't know when to push in and when not to. Often they push hard without rotating for an objective.). But they do not nessesarily outright kill each other. \n\nFrom my perspective, a good gank mostly relies on the surprise momentum and the number advantage. It's usually more convenient to bet on a  2v1 in top then a 3v2 in bot, primarily because there is a lot that can and will likely happen between the moment I move towards it and my arrival. Chances are the moment I am there somebody is already dead and there goes my chance for the Gank - regardless of on which side the death is. If the death is on my team, there is no numbers advantage anymore and my teammate is probably going to recall or just hold the line and my Gank wouldn't change much. If the enemy dies, he is going to flee under his tower and there goes my Gank opportunity.\nIn top this happens in general just way less often.\n\nTop in general has it also easier to really snowball with the advantage from the Gank because it's in general just the more statchecky lane. While ADCs main damage is also mostly point and click, the dynamic with range and the support makes it way easier for both sides to swing the tide into the other direction (which is also what is ment with \"bot is volatile\").\n\nI know that the ADC is supposed to be the primary carry of the game in the late game and top lane is kinda more ambiguous in how much impact they will have, but in all honesty, in soloq at least it feels something extremely random who will actually carry in the end. Might be also because of my low Elo and that I often play normals.\n\nThat would be the reasons I have why I prefer ganking top. Now pls comment why I am wrong lol",
        "num_comments": 9,
        "comments": [
            "the rule of thumb with early game ganking is to gank the most volatile lane, because you can swing the advantage in your favour the most, or the lane with the best gank set up. If top lane has two bruisers, they\u2019ll be fighting a bunch, meaning you can swing the fights in favour of your team and leverage that advantage. If your bot lane has good gank set up, like blitz/naut/leo etc, ganks are much more likely to work out bot. So before you even load in, look at your lanes to see where the most volatile match up is, and where the best gank set up is. Path towards that lane initially. Don\u2019t force ganks that aren\u2019t there though. Lilia is not an early game powerhouse, which means that ganks are a matter of opportunity. Wasted time on a gank is time lost clearing, so never go out of your way to force unless it\u2019s basically guaranteed you can convert the gank.  \n\nFrom there play around your win condition, which will be team and game dependant. I also would say, especially with top, you often don\u2019t want to be camping top once the lane is effectively won lane. That\u2019s not to say don\u2019t gank a winning lane, but don\u2019t gank a WON lane. Because now the outcome doesn\u2019t change with or without you. You have to know top matchups to know when this is though, as it differs each game. But as a top main, if I\u2019m 3-0 with a level and CS lead, I don\u2019t want my jungler showing up unless I ping for it, it can slow down my tempo. Instead, I want my jgl to leverage my pressure into snowballing the game state. Play OFF your strongest members now. That could be as basic as counter jungle topside if your laner is strong and able to assist. Sometimes that is cross mapping, like if your fed top is pushing T2 top and dragon is up. Or it might be about hovering them when you know the enemy team are looking to shut them down. \n\nSame principle applies for bot really. Make sure your carry doesn\u2019t get shut down, leverage their pressure to advance the game state further etc. but if bot is ahead, you don\u2019t want to cross map them like you would with top. Instead you\u2019d want to enable them to get as much as they can. Hover them so they can get tower gold and cs safely, play for obj and fights, etc",
            "As an adc suffering in low elo, the best moment to gank is when I\u2019m being pushed under my tower. Just activate sweeper and run at the enemy from behind. However, check the state of the wave first. Ganking when I have 3 waves under my tower is gonna get all 3 of us killed, most likely. \nSometimes I\u2019ll let the enemy push into me even tho I\u2019m much stronger just because I want them in a position where it\u2019s easy for the jungler to come and gank. \n\nPlease, for the love of rngeesus, don\u2019t take my wave if you did ganked and took a kill or 2. I don\u2019t mind you helping me push when I have to crash a wave after gank, but if you only come bot to tax 3 waves coming my way for no reason, imma follow you around jungle and the game is gonna go to hell.",

It\u2019s been so bad in the recently I switch to jungle so I could maybe understand why they don\u2019t gank top but nope still don\u2019t get it cause your natural rotation of camps will have you right there to gank them multiples times in the first 10 min",
            "Letting the enemy push before a gank hell yeah. Rare sight.",
            "The last thing might be not because of I just wanna tax you but rather because need to establish lane priority for an objective \ud83d\ude10",
            "Botlane prio for drag is hard because what *should* happen is the support roams to drag with you as the adc pushes out the wave. Then, *if* the enemy mid/jg responds, adc moves up. Watching the jg hit the wave to push it faster right after a fight means watching no less than half that cs probably go to someone else, either the jungler or the other team\u2019s minions",
            "Takes wave, gets prio, recalls.\n\nGod damnit.",
            "Honestly I wouldn't mind if that *would* happen :,D"

        "content": "I wanna discuss the whole cheese ganking concept. Every game in low emerald it seems like the jungler that cheese ganks (pre 3:00 min) seems to break the mental of laners super early. \n\nAs the opposing jungler it feels like if you don't do the same, no matter how much of a cs lead you get or punish by taking the opposite map side camps, you just lose the game cause players mental gets broken.\n\nThen they stop rotating to help on objectives which should be free goven enemy recalled, makes the game impossible. But I'm hesitant to cheese cause I feel like I will fall too far behind if it doesn't workout. What to do?",

            "Ping them and tell them to ward specific area at 2:30. Chances are your teammates won't pay attention where enemy jungler started, so take that responsibility on yourself. You should have a rough idea where your enemy jungler is at all stages of the early game. If they didn't get a leash, but you have mid prio, ask them to check enemy raptors and see if they've done it, this should already tell you enough where they are pathing. However, in lower elo, you sometimes have to do sub optimal play just to make it work, so if you are 90% sure that enemy jungler will cheese a bot gank pre 3:00, then try to get there at 2:50."
