This will apply to the Episode Echoes content next Tuesday, which should be spoiled until the following week, along with the raid content.\n\nLoot content is considered a spoiler as well, but we will be more loose about that, so instead keep **loot posts spoiled for 48 hours from their release**, including raid loot, Episode Echoes, etc. \n\nWe've also added several new moderators to help us out during this busy time, so welcome u/switchmod, u/dfreeezzz, u/Mastershroom, and u/iblaise, u/Tapelessbus2122! \n\n We'll be posting a Spoiler discussion thread shortly after launch to keep basic questions and discussions focused to one thread. We hope you all enjoy The Final Shape!",

I don't know what these are but I imagine they're necessary to advance the Prismatic Sublass skills. I'm finding these exceptionally difficult as a casual player. The adventures don't offer me a chance to find or create a fireteam like the normal campaign missions did. Is this on purpose? I'm dying at least 20-25 times in each adventure, just left and right, nowhere to hide from enemies and they just overwhelm me until I fail my way through the mission's end. It doesn't feel very good, and I'm getting extremely frustrated.\n\nAlso when I go to the Pale Heart, there isn't a single soul around. Where the hell is everyone? Why does the game feel like it's not even online? Is there something I have to unlock to find random people around?

Are you into raiding, because you need The Final Shape for the newest raid which is a big deal among hardcore pve players. Do not feel like you need to get it just because it's new. This isn't WoW, being new doesn't inherently mean you need it for some kind of barrier to entry.

The way power level works has been unchanged for about three years now.

            "I don't have any idea what items you have, so here's a vague and general answer:\n\n* You should have a variety of weapons available. I typically recommend at a bare minimum people have a set of weapons for boss DPS and a set of weapons for crowd clearing, and if you want, a set of pvp weapons. Mix and match these depending on what you're going to do at any given time. \n\n* Power level doesn't matter as much as you may think. Individual activities have their own power levels, which it will say if you hover over an activity. Being vastly overpowered doesn't have much benefit, but being underpowered makes this MUCH harder. \n\n* Having a variety of weapons is useful for fulfilling certain objectives, like if you have a bounty or something to kill enemies using a specific item. It's not necessary to upgrade weapons to a higher power if this is all you use them for.\n\n* When it comes to armor pieces, what people look for are the stats. If you like the stats on your armor, feel free to stick with it long term. I like to switch up the exotic armor I use, so I have a few sets of armor to make sure I have items that go with every combination I commonly use.",

Dungeon keys can be purchased for silver (the real money microtransaction currency) from Eververse and they give access to two dungeons each. I am honestly not that into dungeons and hardly play the ones included in the base game and Shadowkeep (Prophecy, Pit of Heresy), so I haven't bought these.

I don't know if Bungie changed the way dungeon loot drops worked, but as of last week how it worked is there was a weekly dungeon rotation and each week, one dungeon was the weekly dungeon you could get one pinnacle engram from completing, and you could farm it for the exotic. Besides that, the other dungeons have a chance of dropping the exotic once per week per class. Do note that some dungeons' exotics are from quests, like Wish Ender, not random drops.",

Older characters have things that newly created characters need to take time and glimmer to unlock. \n\n>is there any way I can refresh my memory on the story without watching a super long lore video? Do I even need to?\n\nWhat I do is I go to youtube and type \"destiny 2 (name of DLC/season pass) cutscene movie\" and there's lots of people who make short videos that are just cutscenes and relevant dialogue. You don't *need* to do this. Since you started with The Red War, if you didn't play Destiny 1 a lot of things were not explained but for me at least, The Red War still made sense. So that's what it will feel like going forward. Lots of characters the game expects you to know, but you can just follow whatever the quest says to do and you will be fine.",
            "I haven't yet bought The Final Shape, but how it worked for Witch Queen and Lightfall legendary campaigns was that it was not worth it. What you got from doing the campaign on legendary was a set of high power level armor (not maximum, but I don't remember the number off the top of my head). Numerically, it isn't worth doing legendary 3x to get it for all your characters because of how the power level of item drops works. If you really want I can write a more detailed explanation of how/why it works this way. You'd also get an exotic armor piece, but these had very disappointing stats so a lot of people preferred to get them through other means. \n\nThe only thing *exclusive* to Legendary for Witch Queen and Lightfall is an emblem. I'd guess this is going to be the same for The Final Shape, but like I said I can't know firsthand.",

If you need a refresher on the names, see the timeline in the upper right of the destinations tab. \n\n>Mechanically, where am I at?\n\nWhen you start up the game, you will automatically be loaded into the first mission of The Final Shape.

Everything above that is just achievements, and your guardian rank is a way of showing off your achievement score to others. \n\n>At what Light Level can I comfortably start dropping into groupfinders and doing raids?\n\nOnly the latest raid has a high power level requirement. That doesn't mean all the other raids are easy, they still require things like a thorough understanding of the game and the ability to communicate with your team. I haven't played in quite a while so I am out of the loop regarding the DPS meta, but at a minimum you should have a loadout for add clear and a loadout for boss DPS. Mix and match them as the encounter demands. There is an actual Loadout feature, but I don't actually use it, I just manually switch weapons, armor, and abilities before each encounter.

            "My post was very not clear. What I was thinking was how do I interact with...threads? Whatever the Lightfall release stuff was.\n\nWhen the cold-themed builds were released, you had to go and unlock them one at a time even years after they came out. I don't think I ever bothered getting all the damn fragments. Will 'green' be the same way?\n\nSorry, it's been a long time since I played, I forget all the names.",

They liked the artist or had it recommended, but they usually hadnt heard most of the music yet, especially for new albums. I already liked the free content in Destiny, so I bought the collection, I just didnt know what was what.",
            "There is power creep, but not as much as you'd expect. This isn't obvious but behind the scenes if you are vastly overpowered, your power level is \"capped\" a certain distance above the enemies, so things that are supposed to be difficult have lower power caps that put you closer to the enemies in power level. As a result, players of vastly different levels can play together without issue, and difficult content always remains at least kind of difficult no matter how overleveled you are.",
            "There's only two ways to contact Bungie. Twitter, and their [official forums](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics). \n\nRealistically speaking, no one is going to see what you say. Lots of janky combinations of not owning paid content leading to people not being able to do things they are supposed to do have popped up before, and if they ever get fixed, it's a long ways after. A couple examples from years past: there used to be a season pass collectible that was embedded in terrain or something if you didn't own Beyond Light, and you couldn't equip a free to play title if you didn't own any DLC.",
            "Bungie acknowledged this and said it's not intentional and would be fixed",
            "Ahh thank you for clarification fair enough. I see this was a while ago just saw it kinda died. Wanted to make sure it wasnt another thing. Have you heard a response yet?",
            "You don't have to play any paid content to level up. Power level hasn't been paywalled for years. I don't remember how many years, but at least 2. \n\nThe way power level works is roughly similar to when you last played. There's a soft cap where everything you do drops higher power level items up until the soft cap. This goes at the same speed for everyone regardless of what content they play, whether it's paid or free. \n\nThen once you reach the soft cap, you will see weekly challenges appearing on the director. Many of these are paywalled, but not all of them. You can do them once a week and this is how you raise your power level higher above the soft cap.",
            "There is some sort of fireteam finder, but I've actually never used it for raids. Communication is important enough that I'm worried I'd match up with people who have too many technical issues, are not willing to use voice chat even if just to listen, or may not speak the same languages I do. \n\nIf you want to do raids, you would need to buy each DLC for access to all of the raids. There's a couple of free to play raids, but most are paid.",
            "I tried playing yesterday, we had to do the 1st mission a second time cause we got booted mid boss, and then again before the cutscene. And then it never let us move onto the next mission.\n\nMeanwhile there\u2019s people on my friend\u2019s list who already beat it :/",
            "Yes. If you feel you truly must have all of these things, then you need to buy them all. I personally don't love dungeons all that much and I played Beyond Light back when it was part of Xbox Gamepass so I have not bought those things. If you buy everything it's a lot.",
            "Each campaign has an icon, and the game expects you to recognize this. See the timeline in the upper right corner of the destinations tab for a list of each icon in order. \n\nIf you have not done the first mission of a campaign, it shows up in your list of milestone objectives on the left side of the destinations tab. If you have already done it, you will see the icon for the next quest on the planet where the mission is.",
            "I didn't buy Beyond Light but I have heard they simplified that system. You pay glimmer at the Exo Stranger to unlock the different stasis abilities now. \n\nFor Lightfall, you do activities on Neomuna and get this intermediate currency. It goes in your inventory tab and you spend it at a vendor on Neomuna called the Pouka Pond to unlock strand abilities. Do note that it is possible to play on one character and spend the currency on other characters, but the game will stop giving you the currency once you have enough to unlock it on one character. So what I did was I played the campaign on my three characters, and then only used my favourite class to do activities on Neomuna *without* fully unlocking strand on that character, but I had to frequently switch characters to spend the strand currency unlocking abilities on my other characters because I kept hitting the cap on my favourite class.",
            "You have three character slots. As long as you don't make two of the same class, you can just try it both ways. \n\nI personally prefer sticking with the same character, but ultimately you need to make your own decisions.",

            "For video games, I feel like there are a lot of predatory and unfair monetization decisions. The Legacy Collection is not that, I think it's a good deal, but there are a lot of purchases for this game that are considered a ripoff. Some aren't available any more, like a starter pack that was so hated they removed it from stores after a couple of days. But other examples would be event cards, a type of purchase only available during holiday events, and the 30th anniversary pack upon its initial release (when part of a bundle I think it's a good deal, but not on its own).",
            "Thank you, I own all he expansions minus the final shape (waiting on payday), I purchased defiance, witch, and deep, I simply skipped on the wish out of burn out, I'd gladly just fork over the 10 bucks if it meant getting my weapons, but thats not really a possibility either. So I'm currently shit out of luck on them.",
            "We are aware of an issue where players who completed crafting patterns from Seasons 20 through 23 while they were available to are no longer able to craft these weapons. This is not intentional and will be resolved in a future update. Seems they acknoledged the issue.",
            "Nope, but I'll likely scan through the twab and see if any updates to the issue was provided. I've checked the enclave 4 times and still cannot craft. I'm over it just wish I didnt delete my godrolls to make space for crafted guns. Atleast the new expansion is more than enough fun to offset the frustration.",
            "I didn't mean that the level itself is paywalled.\n\nThe legendary campaign gives you a set of armor that is 1960 light level. If you don't own the expansion and do the legendary campaign then you are forced to grind public events to level up from 1900 to 1940, which is the level that every actual activity says you need to be. After that you can level like normal by doing strikes, nightfalls, the pathfinder etc.\n\nWhen I plug my account into the website that tells you what to do next it just says \"world drops.\"\n\nI'm not going to, and nobody should want to, grind public events for weeks in order to be able to play strikes or dungeons/raids that I paid for years ago, just to see if the game is in a decent state right now. It's not for me, and it's not something I'd recommend to returning players unless they jump fully in and pay up.",
            "Since im not near a console, how much are the dlcs?",
            "So the regular Destiny expansion experience then. LOL.",
            "I think some stuff is free now. Maybe everything before Witch Queen? Not sure, need to do more research, but I am at work right now. Lol",
            "No I had to go in to the abandoned quests thingie\n\nBut thanks",
            "Yeah, I played through a bit this morning and you just buy the fragments at Ikora.\n\nStrand is just all sorts of messed up because I guess I got some strand abilities just by buying Final Shape - given what happens in the first mission.",
            "I'm over soft cap (1957)",
            "Nah I gotchu, I figured the collection with the stuff that i had seen sold for way more in the past would be a good deal. Thanks for the help, tryna get the Conditional Finality",
            "I have been trying to explain but I seem to have misunderstood what you're trying to ask. \n\nYou don't have to grind public events. You can do absolutely anything you have access to. \"World drops\" is the catchall term for the pool of items that come from any activity. I am sorry that you saw that and assumed it had to be public events. If you don't want to play that is perfectly fine.",
            "There's a sale on Steam right now, but I don't know about other platforms because sale schedules aren't synchronized. The monetization guide linked in the original post has the regular price in USD for everything. I just updated it yesterday!",

            "You are really annoying to converse with. You don't read what people actually say and just make assumptions that only seem to serve to try to make them look bad. I was happy to give you the benefit of the doubt the first time but now it's obviously on purpose so I'm not going to waste more of my time dealing with you.\n\nI literally said that every activity is locked behind a 1945 level requirement besides public events and you say \"oh I'm sorry you assumed that you can only do public events.\" because you ignored literally everything else I said and took one thing I said completely out of context.\n\nEven if I continued to give you every benefit of the doubt.. Instead of trying to make me feel bad for misunderstanding something perhaps you could actually tell me what activities I can do at 1900 light level. But you would have just done that if you could have.",
            "I looked and it was just that all the expansions up to Lightfall were free until this past Tuesday when The Final Shape released. I guess that means I just actually bought what I have and forgot about it.\n\nIn my defense, it has been a long time, I WAS trying to play this game on a laptop for a while. Anyway, got it figured out now, I think. Thanks.",

We kind of just showed up there, they were vaguely racist toward us, then we ended up with a common goal and most of everything we know about Nimbus is that they're fairly agreeable and largely incompetent. You know, given that bungie set them up as a quest giver even though half the jobs they have us doing are ostensibly what they exist for. \n\nConversely guardians, and players, have had a long and confusing relationship with the hive and especially the Lucent Hive specifically since we share a kind of kinship with them that basically nothing else in the universe can really understand. It probably stirred up a lot of emotions for people to have a lucent wizard basically tell us that at least some of the Brood has our backs.

Like Neomuna for the most part was just introduced to us, we\u2019re supposed to just chug on through without much time to think or ask questions. Whereas the Lucent Hives introduction felt more sinister and a mockery at the time for guardians in lore. Like it was a shocking turn of events and even had a small seasonal story focused on us gradually killing/hunting down lucent hive for draining guardians of their light to prevent a ritual from being enacted. Neomuna didn\u2019t allow for that to be explored, just dropping it on us that \u201cthere\u2019s a hidden city on Neptune\u201d and nothing else to explore with it.

IIRC literally asks Ghosts questions at times to specifically make us look bad while informing the Neomuni of the situation happening.\n\nNot to mention, the people in charge at Neomuna *forcibly* made everyone enter the CloudNet, even if they didn't want to. So they aren't exactly the best leaders.\n\n  \nIt's explained pretty quickly in lore as well about how they were hidden. The Veil was hidden there, and the Vex wanted it. So they basically \"sectioned\" off the area from the Universe. Outside couldn't look in, but inside couldn't communicate with outside. I feel like this is somewhat similar to when the Vex put a simulation over the Last City, albeit this wasn't a simulation but more of a firewall.\n\n  \nThe disdain is entirely intended, and I think deserved to have been *fleshed out more*. Again, these people abandoned us and AFAIK never made any attempts to contact or help humanity. Hell, they went as far as to *hide* us by having that 1 Cloudstrider go to Earth and cover up their existence. They clearly didn't want to associate with us for whatever reason, so the wonder isn't meant to be this long-lasting feeling. You are supposed to be mad they wanted to hide from you while also concealing something as important as the Veil. They are entirely meant to look bad.

Every other extraterrestrial colony went completely silent.   \nThen the dead started rising from the grave, taking control of every available resource, and continually murdering each other and everyone else with heretofore unheard of space magic. \nThen the aliens invaded.  \nIn the International Relations playbook, these are commonly referred to as \"red flags.\"   \n\nNot to mention, Neomuna's military strength seems to consist of a few orbital cannons and 1-2 dudes (and/or dude-adjacent individuals).

Nimbus dying (while I would've been sad to see perhaps our 1 honestly happy and upbeat character die) sets up a unique situation of Rohan being the last Cloudstrider *who is almost timed out* having to find someone new to mentor. But then we would need to shoehorn a new Cloudstrider in with no room to fit them for the campaign, and they wouldn't've really had any way of fitting in the overall plot. *Unless* if the launch season was about having a detachment of guardians establish themselves as Neomuna's new protectors while fitting off the threat of the Witness?

            "because the average player hates gambit, so they decide to hop in as a 4 stack with friends on the hopes it'll be more fun, only to get strung out and wiped by the opposite 4 stack of gambit mains because gambit is CBMM",

            "as a crucible main (I'm sorta out of now) I actually prefer gambit, it really makes me realize how BAD crucible can get if gambit makes me feel some joy again. When I started I played gambit so was almost made for the mode",

            "honestly I did a buncha gambit for the Pathfinder and got to rank 9. Not the worst even tho I don't play it a lot. fun trying to be as fast as possible with kills and the such. Even got most invader kills of a few matches with a load out not designed for invading lmao. I get the appeal but I also get the hate; it's a very \"I'll play it every now and then\" type of game mode for me",
            "Awesome gamemode on paper but it seriously needs a total revamp at this point imo, builds and weapons trivialize the PvE and PvP elements of it, and the dwindling population of the mode leads to matches where you will die the second you invade because the enemy team is literally camping every spawn.\n\nI think the maps, the PvE encounters, and the way invasions work need a serious revamp for it to be fun for me (and a wider audience) again.",
            "I feel like the only bad thing about gambit is the lack of updates it gets. I find it to be a really fun game mode but it does get stale playing the same maps over and over sometimes. I think a 6v6 gambit with bigger maps and vehicles would be pretty cool.",
            "As much as I hate crucible, as frustrating as it is, I'd rather play it all day than do one goddamn playlist strike ever again. Running normal difficulty strikes is the most absolute mind numbing shit.\n\n\nBetween gambit and onslaught I can get all my pathfinders done, and I'm happy with that",
            "I love gambit and I wish more people would love it too.\n\nShould it be more like trials or iron banner or guardian games? \n\nNo.\n\nI would accept it as alternating between one week per month or only available on the weekends but NOT if it's a segue to phase it out.\n\nIt's a fun game mode. It sucks to lose. It sucks to get owned by the invader just as you're about to bank 15 motes. It sucks to be defeated as an invader with zero downs. There are a lot of misfortunes but it's really fun, nonetheless.\n\nYou have to constantly think about destiny in terms of Damage Reserves vs peak executable DPS.\n\nThe first is about the total damage available in your ammo reserves, the second is more about Damage per fired round plus the time to reload. \n\nOr Volume vs Time/speed.\n\nYou really need both. \n\nWhat good is high DPS if you have low reserves? Inversely, what good is High Reserves if the reload takes too long and the fire rate is slow, and magazine size is small.\n\nMany people (including experts) just sell the point of DPS, some admittedly think it's obvious that the audience thinks about both, or that DPS necessarily implies both, or that DPS also includes accuracy. However, as someone who has had to explain to people that reload speed and fire rate generally affects DPS - I'm constantly convinced that DPS requires a more comprehensive discussion.\n\nAnyways, all that is to say that Gambit is an avenue by which you internalize how you rank on executable DPS with others.\n\nIt's hard to live life constantly avoiding comparing yourself to others, and there's definitely a need for that but Destiny is a competitive game.\n\nLosing doesn't mean to punish yourself, but rather should be taken as an indicator that further refinement may be necessary. For some people that means improving accuracy, for some, that means different weapons or different super.",
            "The problem with Gambit, for most, is that it puts pve with PvP, and pve players dont like the PvP elements, and vice versa.\n\nI, personally, find it the right amount for PvP per PvE, and love that mode (reminds me a LOT of battleborn, that had a mode like that but with both teams on the same map, and only one bank at center, with limited windows to deposit the enemy drops)",
            "Honestly for me most it is because it got stale and bot enough people play to the mode vs just killing shit. Gambit Prime was a cool change that due to how the majority of randoms play (I.E the majority of the player base it feels) was pretty much dead on arrival. Outside of being heavily encouraged that's why most of the activities have died. \n\nA mixture of the playerbase just doesn't enjoy ritual activities and some of that is due to bungie neglecting every single one of the rituals as well. (Yes including strikes)",
            "Good chance if you\u2019re team plays well in gambit you can win the match. Gambit is a cointoss, regardless.",
            "I don\u2019t get why some people like viscerally hate PvP in this game lol. I get it\u2019s not for everybody but I feel like some people would literally rather die than play a control match",
            "This is my 3rd reset in gambit this season(yes going for 4th). As long as i dont have obscure pathfinder missions i will gladly continue finishing my pathfinders in gambit.",
            "If i had to choose between Playing gambit or the crucible i would rather play gambit",
            "Because after 4000 hours invested gambit is beyond irritating. I can clear out the map. Provide about 79-87 motes. Drop invaders to protect my teammates. Just for us to still lose. Now I get it. I always help with content where I can. But dear lord gambit is just bad when it comes to matchmaking. When I invade I at least grab 2 with me. When I see randoms invade they just flat die or they grab a kill but not motes from the enemy cause you can tell from the grey progress bar. Another infuriating thing is watching randoms hold onto x15 motes to just die because they're not being careful. Or when the enemy team spawns knights you hear an alarm blaring on your audio you turn to look an literally no one is killing them. An drifter in the meantime is literally begging you to kill them because they're bleeding motes yet majority of the time no one is killing the knights. Do I expect a perfect game every match up no. That's not realistic. But I get tired of trying my best to perform well just to either lose horribly or have a strong lead to just lose it at the end for no reason. I used to LOVE gambit but unfortunately it just has too many inconsistencies.",
            "same.",
            "FINALLY SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS\n\nits the ONLY one that doesnt genuinely make me want to blow my fucking brains out. strike playlists are fucking boring, crucible is only fun when youre winning, but skating back and forth between spawns in gambit and erasing adds? sniping the invader who portal camps woth a xeno and emoting? getting rapid OMA medals??? the dopamine hits are incredible",
            "I still play both, maybe I\u2019m crazy",
            "Same",

            "Well\u2026I don\u2019t just play gambit, ever since curs update I play a lot more dares",
            "I liked both equally but my favorite gambit was gambit prime and when that got changed it got boring to me so now I just crucible main. I can\u2019t stand strikes that\u2019s actually just brain dead.",
            "I personally prefer the more structured/repetitive nature of strikes/nightfalls but gambit is still great fun whenever the mood strikes me. I especially love using AOE weapons like Ergo Sum with Arc Conductor to blast my way through basic mobs and LMGs or power swords to take on the Primeval.",

            "I'm a gambit player it's far more entertaining to me than crucible. I don't have to be good at pvp to do my part for us to win.",
            "i genuinely only log onto the game to play gambit its by far the most fun activity to me",

            "Dregen Gildedx10 and my clan is legion \n\nCome at us Crucible Bros. We dare you.",
            "I feel like the people who say they hate Gambit are also the people who exclusively play Crucible and say how much they hate that too.",
            "Gambit imo is really fun. Crucible is sweaty on top of not having the time to make a viable gambit build. I still play it a little here and there and the good games feel really good",
            "The name\u2019s Gambit. Remember it",
            "I only play crucible and gambit. The only reason I play any other part of the game is to get new gear to use in crucible and gambit. This isn't satire, it's just what I enjoy.",
            "Gambit is garbage. Praying it gets vaulted everyday\ud83d\ude4f",
            "I hate gambit so much. Playing a single game could give me full artifice armour in the exact roll I want, down to the last point and I still wouldn't play it.",
            "Because Rekoning was 1000% better than the stack stomp that is currently Gambit. \n\nWhy it was removed is still a mystery.",
            "Honestly, the only one I don't enjoy are strikes \ud83d\ude14",
            "You crazy (I also like gambit)",
            "I also prefer gambit",
            "I love gambit too, until i join a team from one clan and they just stood there trolling",

            "I do wonder since i haven\u2019t touched gambit for a while, did still hunt become the new best sniper for invading?",

            "I choose crucible because I\u2019m trying to get better at it. Making progress!",
            "Gambit is chill, it\u2019s definitely the more engaging than vanguard, and less stressful than crucible",
            "One of one",
            "Hot take if the destiny player base took 15 minutes to understand the basics of the mode, do a little bit of theorycrafting strategy, and just equipped a good ranged primary/sniper/machine gun to kill invaders or go invade them gambit would be really fun",
            "I lovem both..",
            "If you've got at least one buddy, Private Crucible matches will count for Pathfinder (unless they've fixed it this week). In my case, that's why.",
            "I'd soon rather have a lobotomy then play crucible. It honestly gets me so mad to the point I do the stereotype and punch a hole through my wall.",
            "Gambit is so much fun, and it's my absolute favorite.",
            "The amount of Gambit I've played to complete Pathfinder rewards so I *DON'T* touch PvP would make PvP mains vomit.",
            "I think my main issue with Gambit is mode variety and loot incentive \n\nI mean, you have countless strikes to choose from with their own difficulties and enemy types and encounter variations (double Barrier Knights in Europa BG and Tormentor room in Lake) and damage surges to encourage different playstyles and builds from silly to optimal \n\nIn Crucible, the variety in mode is obvious, from the base 6v6 to comp to the rotating fun mode to rumble and then trials every weekend. You then get your varied maps, and the biggest variation - your teammates and enemies. Every game, what your opponents and allies are using is bound to be different, from the Conditional Igneous trials basement dweller, to the Revision Zero Athrys trickshotter, to the 6 stack rat king memers. Variety limited by weaponry and buildcraft\n\nThen, there\u2019s gambit. Which has one mode at all times, with one repetitive playstyle, with its variety being trivialised PVE enemies, the same 4 maps and whatever heavy the invader is gonna done you with (Xenophage or Levvy\u2019s? Pick your poison, modern Reckoner). It\u2019s the same gameplay loop over and over with major annoyances thrown in too. Kill ads, grab heavy, bank motes, invade, damage boss, kill shielders, kill boss, with the variables of \u201cdie to invader\u201d \u201cget invasion stolen\u201d \u201cget fucked by blockers\u201d \u201cdie immediately after entering invasion portal\u201d being added in at your leisure, and some of the variables being constantly repeated. It becomes mind numbing and not worth it\n\nI mean, there\u2019s that, and the lack of higher loot incentive, which is really ironic. Drifter\u2019s all about \u201cGuardians need their pay every now and then\u201d, but Zavala\u2019s here giving me Ascendant Shards, Nightfall Ciphers and Adept weapons, Shaxx is there giving me Artifice armour and high tier comp loot, and Saint is giving out Trials gear, which needs no introduction. Meanwhile Drifter has **fuck all nothing**. Shit armour and free glimmer from dismantling ANOTHER GODDAMN SPRAY PAINT. Maybe a shader from his reputation track. Why would I play Gambit over a GM?",
            "Do you even get rewards for just playing gambit or crucible? Other than the rank shit",
            "I miss the old ol days when we had special armor sets for gambit, I'd just murder invaders the second they dropped in.",
            "I tried Crucible one time, the other team wouldn't let my team leave the spawn, I haven't played it since then.\nIm happy playing Gambit, Crucible players can suck my gun",

            "only issue i really have with gambit is the way they handle invasions.  \na while back they were testing out a revised version of the invasions so that the opposite side would get them when you banked motes. it honestly felt so much better and made so much more sense but they just never actually did anything with that beyond the original test mode, and now we're forever stuck with the possibility of one side completely stomping another because of invasions.",

Meanwhile, pve is pretty unique as far as shooters go.

As Cammy sort of explains in one of his videos, sorry I forgot which one exactly, what he looks for in PVP builds is the \"Sunlight Hurts My Eyes\" moment, a sick impressive trick shot. He likely doesn't kill you in the most efficient way, even though he probably can, but he will certainly try to cook up a kill that is so impressive (and probably convoluted) that even if Destiny introduces kill cams, you might still be confused by what just happened. That isn't to say that Cammy doesn't play \"the meta\" ever, like back when Void 3.0 first released, you'd sometimes see him play void over-shield titan in comp or trials.",

Frost is a beast and plays at a high IQ level.  They\u2019re two of my favorite streamers and when they matched up not once, but twice in the same trials run, I was ecstatic.  When Frost was like \u201cthat\u2019s CammyCakes \u201c, I was thinking \u201cwell, time to reset your ticket\u201d.
