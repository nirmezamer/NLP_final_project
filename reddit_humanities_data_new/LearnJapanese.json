            "\n#Question Etiquette Guidelines:\n\n* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.\n\n>\uff38 What is the difference between \u306e and \u304c ?\n\n>\u25ef I saw a book called \u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u306e\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e , why is \u306e used there instead of \u304c ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)\n\n* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. \n\n>\uff38 What does this mean?\n\n>\u25ef I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.\n\n\n* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.\n\n* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.\n\n>\uff38 What's the difference between \u4e00\u81f4 \u540c\u610f \u8cdb\u6210 \u7d0d\u5f97 \u5408\u610f?\n\n>\u25ef Jisho says \u4e00\u81f4 \u540c\u610f \u8cdb\u6210 \u7d0d\u5f97 \u5408\u610f all seem to mean \"agreement\". I'm trying to say something like \"I completely agree with your opinion\". Does \u5168\u304f\u540c\u611f\u3067\u3059\u3002 work? Or is one of the other words better?\n\n* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between \u306f and \u304c ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the \"u\" sound in \"desu\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).\n\n* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.\n\n---------------------\n\nUseful Japanese teaching symbols:\n\n\u2718 incorrect (\uff2e\uff27)\n\n\u25b3 strange/ unnatural / unclear\n\n\u25cb correct\n \n\u2252 nearly equal\n\n---------------------\n\n#NEWS (Updated 3/07):\n\nAdded a section on symbols.

            "Controversial and I am sure unpopular suggestion: go and read r/japantravel for a bit. Note down the itineraries there and then \\*don't\\* go to any of those places. \n\nThat's a bit extreme, but there is a lot more to Japan than fairly well-trodden tourist routes. If you want to meet and talk to Japanese people you will have at least a different set of opportunities in less \"you must go here\" sorts of places.\n\nOf course \"all of Japan\" does include Tokyo, Kyoto and so on, but there's a lot more to Japan than that. Shikoku - an entire home island - rarely seems much by way of foreign tourism (sometimes people go to Naoshima which is technically in Kagawa, but...). Lots to see there, though easier if you can drive and rent a car. \n\nBut as others will point out better than I, even in the really tourist dense areas, you will surely find people to talk to - that was my experience - and if you go even a hair's breadth off the very beaten track you will find all sorts of experiences. Obviously if your time is limited you will miss out on seeing the key tourist spots, but you might enjoy yourself more. Life isn't a tick box.\n\nWell, that's my thought. I rather enjoy wandering around the towns and cities of Japan, as well as in the countryside.\n\nThe other people commenting are making more conventional points, but they are all good ones. Don't overthink, be friendly and polite and so on. All good.\n\nSome places it seems easier to get into conversation with locals than others. Some places it is hard to get a konnichiwa out of anyone but in others people do come and chat (even when they aren't Jehovah's Witnesses).",

Japanese people in the tourist industry are very happy to have customers and while locals might not be happy about overcrowding in some places, shop owners are very happy to have plenty of customers.\n\n\nSo don't over think it, it you have a chance to go, go for it\u00a0",

Once I did this, it was freeing, and I enjoyed my time there.\n\n\nAlso, halfway through my studies, I had to make an honest assessment and ask myself why I am learning japanese. I settled on this: I am learning for myself for my own enrichment.\n\n\nI had some lovely conversations long and short, but also some pretty hostile encounters.\n\nNice encounters: \n\n A 20 year old who was studying English noticed I said \u304a\u90aa\u9b54\u3057\u307e\u3059 and \u5931\u793c\u3057\u307e\u3059 on the plane, and we talked for hours and exchanged LINE information. \n\nIn Kanazawa, the restaurant staff was amazed and got \u4e0a\u624b quite a bit. Same in Gero Onsen and other small and mid-sized cities. They really appreciated the effort.\n\nBad encounters: \n\nTokyo was no different than most American East Coast cities. The problem really is kyoto. It was  not very nice because you can tell they are fed up, and they are also very stuck up. Fuck em.\n\n Osaka was more friendly and fun, but also they were very happy to get your money. \n\nOverall: \n\nI enjoyed my trip and am already planning to go again.

Zero English was used by anyone.\n\nThe discussion turned to how before Last Train, Golden Gai is like 70% tourist. Not even really a negative way, more just an observation.

            "I have gone to Japan quite a few times and often go outside of the touristy places due to my other hobby (And I had been to Kyoto, Osaka, Tokyo in my first trip there years ago), sometimes to far flung places that few Japanese have even heard of. Tourists mainly annoy  Japanese and Japanese business owners by\n\n\\* eating while walking on the street. Either you take the food back to hotel or eat right outside of the food stall that sell the street food so the smell of your food or the food itself doesn\u2019t get onto other pedestrians\n\n\\* ordering the amount of food less than  the number of servings of people in the group. For example, ordering 2 sets of lunch for a group of 3 and then share or even one of the person not eating. That\u2019s a big no-no. Order the exact number of sets of food for the number of people in the group. if you are in an izakaya, you need to order at least one drink per person.  if you finish your drink, some izakaya expect you to order a new one\n\n\\* littering.  Take  trash back to hotel. I usually keep a plastic bag in my bag just to keep all the trash throughout the day.  You can use the trash cans outside the convenience store but only if the trash comes from products you bought at the store from what I heard.   You can also use the trash cans at train station platforms. Also put the trash in the right trash can (combustible vs newspaper vs cans and bottles,etc) . Never litter.\n\n\\* using cash when riding bus and holding up the bus while fumbling how much to pay on the way out. Use transit cards like suica or pasmo card when riding buses. Tap the card on the way in and tap the card on the way out, and the machine will figure out the fare and deduct the right amount so easy for everyone.\n\n\\* Being loud on train or bus.  Japanese can tolerate a lot on a train (I had seen a woman laying a dozen makeup things out on the window sill and put a full makeup on during the ride) but one thing they don\u2019t like is noise. Some teenagers may get loud on a train but you are an adult and they expect you to act like one. Turn your phone to silent mode. Bonus:  if you are a man on a crowed train, keep your hands up on a pole or something so they are above your shoulder and visible for all to see, just so no one can claim you get handsy on anyone.\n\nIf you want to talk with local, izakaya outside of major cities are your  best bet because they see far fewer tourists. But even they usually get fully booked or extremely busy on Friday nights.  Also, only talk with them when they are open to talk.  Not everyone wants be your free japanese practice partner",

            "I think you\u2019re overthinking this. I went to Japan twice last year in January and December 2023 and plan to go again this year. I had no issues as a singular woman  who speaks Japanese. The people they have problems with are large groups of people that take up all the space. In the case of my friend that I went with in January (who couldn\u2019t speak much Japanese) people weren\u2019t bothered by her either. We didn\u2019t talk loudly and observed Japanese etiquette based on what we were seeing around us. You\u2019re already learning Japanese and planning to do this too, so you\u2019re off to a great start. Heck, you made this post, that shows you care.\n\nMy advice is choose to avoid areas that are super crowded or if you must go, go at non peak hours. There are plenty of amazing activities that you can do that most tourists aren\u2019t doing. There are also awesome cities that no one is visiting. One of the cities I went to was so unwell known that a few Japanese people I met struggled with the kanji. I went to an area where I and two other guys (who live in Japan) were the only non Japanese people were visiting (we were in a hiking group, which was awesome for my Japanese practise).\n\nThere are some awesome etiquette videos online and do\u2019s and don\u2019t\u2019s. I\u2019m sure you can find some.",

Just remember, Japanese ppl want to provide the best service to you. I only had one incident where the Japanese server at a restaurant got someone else who could speak English to take my order. I ordered in Japanese still. He prolly went back and told them I can speak Japanese bc after that she would talk to me. I went there again a few days later and that same lady talked to me in Japanese. So they aren\u2019t being rude, they just want to provide the best service so don\u2019t be disheartened and speak it. \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve been studying for 2 years. Just go. As long as you are not loud or obnoxious, you\u2019ll be fine. And don\u2019t believe everything you hear on TikTok. A lot of it is bs. \n\nAs I said I stick out like a sore thumb but I\u2019ve never felt more at home. I even had a kid come up to me and ask me in Japanese what time it was. He could\u2019ve picked the other Japanese ppl standing there but he picked me. I answered him in Japanese. Maybe he just wanted to talk to a foreigner but I was super glad he felt comfortable to approach me and ask in Japanese. It made my day.",
            "If you go anywhere even slightly outside of the main tourist destinations, it's much more comfortable.

But that's good, because most of that over-tourism you keep hearing about is in, like, less than half a dozen places. If you're really *that* worried about being another tourist in the fishbowl, then just go somewhere else in Japan.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Japan is huge. You don't have to just go to Tokyo and Kyoto. Go to Kagoshima. I'm always telling people to go there and no one does. But you should--black vinegar cuisine, best wagyu, endless shochu, and an eerie, well-worn, well-loved, former-glory vibe. Or go rent a car in Okayama (place by the station has great rates) and drive around Shikoku on a wild narrow-road adventure. Read some Dazai and then spend some time traipsing around Aomori.\n\nI guarantee you will not see *any* over-tourism in those places. You might not even see another non-Asian tourist.\n\nAlso, as a heads up: It's almost as cringey to be an overly self-effacing tourist as it is to be a thoughtless one. Not quite, but almost. An ounce of common sense will benefit you immensely. Just be normal and Japanese people--like people anywhere--literally won't give two shits about you.",

            "I've spent about 4 years in Japan, 1 year studying in Kyoto, half a year in Tokyo and half a year in a little hot spring town in Kyushu. Being able to hold the most basic conversation in Japanese will set you apart from tourists and lead you to places tourists simply won't know about. That being said, if you don't blend in with the crowd, it takes a bit of work to get past the *gaijin kabe* (foreigner wall) to get to the conversation, and that gets harder depending on where you go.\n\nIt's hardest in Kyoto where the locals are fatigued by wide-eyed tourists clogging up public services and turning their local neighbourhood shrine into a superficial photo opportunity. If you go to bars and izakayas anywhere outside of Shijo Kawaramachi and Gion, though, you'll get to meet locals in a more conducive environment.\n\nLiving in the countryside makes you more of a curiosity - there are definitely places that still rarely get foreign visitors and that can turn you into a bit of a spectacle. If you speak even a little Japanese there, people tend to be blown away. That being said, unless you're making a life there, there might not be enough common ground to get over the *gaijin kabe* and have a proper conversation.\n\nTokyo has been the most comfortable for me. People here are simply used to foreigners, so there's less wrangling with the *gaijin kabe*, and the city is large enough that there isn't really \"over tourism\" like there is in Kyoto. Tourists tend to cluster in niche neighbourhoods and sightseeing spots like Asakusa or Akihabara. Wandering down nightlife streets in Shinjuku, it's not hard to find a small izakaya where the owner chats with the customers while serving.\n\nUltimately, you will get out what you put in. If you hit all the tourist spots, constantly taking pictures and shoving Google Translate in people's faces, you will be treated like a tourist. If you demonstrate you have learned more than \"konnichiwa\" and \"arigato\", and treat locals like any other human being, you will be treated in kind. That is to say, I have N2 in Japanese and still have to convince people that I am in fact capable of conversing with them in their language on a regular basis. My advice is to not be afraid of going off the beaten path! People will more often than not reward you for it. If you really want to immerse yourself, consider joining the WWOOF programme as I first did going to Japan. You get to skip right over the tourist boundary and live with the locals.

My brother and I traveled to lesser-known places like Onomichi, Okayama, Shizuoka, Takamatsu, and Kisogawa near Nagoya and the disparity between tourists there and in a few concentrated locations of Tokyo was stunning (I think we saw \\~8 foreign tourists in our whole day in Takamatsu).

They ban alcohol on the streets because of some misbehaved tourists in Shibuya but anybody who did a pub crawl in Shinbashi or Yurakucho on a Friday night knows that Japanese salary men are not an ounce more behaved when drunk on the street. \n\nIn reality, only very few places in Japan experience actual over-tourism, and most of them are in Kyoto. For your own sake, stay clear of the \"beaten path\" as much as possible. Don't visit the big spots in Kyoto that are overrun by tourists, it's just not worth it. The reason why those places became famous in the first place is their unique architecture and atmosphere. But with thousands of people around, it all feels like a theme park. There are many places in Japan where you can still have old houses and a nice atmosphere without the tourist masses. \n\nDon't visit places just because they are on a list, visit them because you want to.

            "I will say that the tourist areas are famous for a reason, though. Yeah sure you can ride a few stations over from a tourist hotspot in Tokyo and see nobody. But in the case of Tokyo, I find that a lot of those neighborhoods are no different than any random neighborhood in any random city here. I live in Sendai \u2014 which isn\u2019t particularly known for anything and I have been in neighborhoods in Tokyo that if you dropped me off blindfolded, I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference from some random Sendai neighborhood.",
            "The Japanese are much like the Koreans in that they are not as internationalized as people in Western countries that at one time had vast colonial overseas empires. They appreciate foreigners who are sincerely interested in Japanese culture and language, but otherwise never insist on seeing them. So I would not call it xenophobia.",

            "The issue is that while yes, the population of the country on a. *whole* is declining, the population centers (I.e. Tokyo) are growing in population as more people leave the inaka. It just so happens that those are the places the mass surge of tourists is flocking into as well. And that\u2019s how we\u2019ve ended up in an overtourism crisis.\n\nI live in Tohoku, but the last time I was down in Tokyo, there were areas that had just as many, if not more, foreigners to actual Japanese people. I have never seen it like that before.",
            "idk, I've been in Japan for 6 years and haven't noticed a change. Maybe if you go often to tourist areas you'll feel it, but outside of those you'd barely notice the tourism boom.\n\nPart of the overcrowding problem is that all tourists are sent to the same handful of places. If you want to really be appreciated as a tourist, head to underserved regions like Tohoku or far west Japan/Kyushu.

I cannot convey how strong and prevalent it is - so much so that it lends itself to actions and behaviours which seem xenophobic\n\nA common example is people moving away from you on the train. Often Ive heard this complaint from Australians and Americans who talk loudly on the train. You don\u2019t do that here and so it makes people uncomfortable\n\nMore than once, Ive also had a Japanese people tell me that that they\u2019re worried about being spoken to in English and not being able to understand or help. As a result they limit contact with foreigners.\n\nSpeaking as a terrible Japanese speaker (For now!), even trying to speak a little bit of polite Japanese results in a noticeable butt-unclenching effect in the vicinity\n\nimo though, the one exception is probably Osaka folk.

            "T\u014dhoku is what Japanese people think of when they think of _inaka_ (\u7530\u820e) places. It's Japan's version of the Deep South or the more rural US Midwestern States. It's a region of Japan with many nice things to offer, but its reputation within Japan as a backward-ass rural region means that most Japanese tourists don't go there as a first choice. Most of the popular spots are west and south of T\u014dky\u014d.\n\nRemember that the Yamato kingdom never conquered the region north of the Kant\u014d Plain, but instead assimilated it culturally. T\u014dhoku is very mountainous and cold in the winter, so despite trying hard the Yamato kingdom didn't conquer it militarily like it did everything west of the Kinki (\u8fd1\u757f) region. The Kant\u014d region became politically and culturally important towards the end of the Heian Period and early during the Kamakura Shogunate. In time it would become as heavily urbanized as the Kinki region, eventually becoming the most populous part of Japan by the middle of the Edo Period.",

            "Take a small break when you're feeling super burnt out, not when you're simply forgetting things.\n\nStart by removing the \"most likely normal\" part first and fully internalize that's literally what learning is. The idea that you'd remember something by only seeing it once or even multiple times and it's somehow going to be there locked in forever with perfect recall is silly.\n\nSeparate your own ego from the situation and realize that forgetting something isn't a negative reflection of your ability. You're probably forgetting information all the time on other things in your daily life, but you've not tied those things to your ego. You ever forget where your car keys or cell phone are? Is that a reflection on you?

Read for the sake of reading, watch series for the sake of watching, don't try to understand everything. And if you forget something, it's okay, you'll eventually learn it.\n\n\n\nI learned English without learning English. I spent years in an institute where I learned nothing. NOTHING. And wanting to watch faster animes was the reason I started immersion. And not six hours a day, I didn't have time for that. 5 years later I can already read, speak, understand.
