What the hell is happening last year things weren't as bad. It seems that everyday things are getting more and more expensive. And I'm not seeing the benefits for any of these. Everything is getting more expensive and I see wages stagnate. Am I crazy or is the whole of Canada going under. I mean, both me and my wife work full time jobs and we are left with little money to put aside, some months we don't put anything aside. We drive a compact, no lavish excursions or vacation trips, what the hell are we working just to pay bills and put food on the table???? Am I crazy?\n\nL.E. I didn't frame the question correctly, I noticed prices going up, but yesterday it got to the point of being shocking.",

Given that 179 out of 194 countries around the world are or have experienced inflation since 2020 (according to the IMF) NO CANADA IS NOT GOING UNDER, THIS IS A GLOBAL PHENOMENON!

The Canadian dollar will continue to devalue hard, which especially sucks since most of our goods are imported from the USA.  I'm sorry to say, but as much inflation happened after Covid... we are going to see *just as much/more* inflation over the next year or two.\n\nMost grocery items have gone up in price at least 1.5x or 2x, compared to 2019.  I think by 2026-27 things will have gone up 4x to 5x compared to 2019 prices.  Especially if the Bank of Canada continues to cut rates, while the US Federal Reserve stays put.\n\nI genuinely feel badly for everyone and wish we lived in better times.

Even some stores have decent steaks that goes on promo for $15 the kg. We bought a shit ton last time. Vacuumed packed. There are some spices that we use a lot that were on sales to $4 instead of $7 usually. We stocked on that too and are good for the year.

It would have been a paradise, much more money for disability, housing would have crashed or corrected to an over abundance, governments would have been forced to enact baby bonus, over abundance of jobs. It would have been Baby Boomer 2.0 where all of us reading would have had ginormous homes and took over all our bosses jobs. \n\nInstead we all sacrificed to help the elderly who have almost completed their lives.

I don't think this was substantially the case... with the bulk of bond purchasing amounting to a redistribution of existing supply. \n\nThis leaves the bulk of price increases driven by supply chain shocks (that we are still working through), and an uptick in velocity of the existing supply. \n\nAs a side note: \"Settlement Balances\" (BoC balance sheet item) were substantially increased, but these aren't spendable in the real economy. \n\n...\n\nAnyway, changes nothing (and not disagreeing in spirit); people's wages increased, but nowhere near a rate to match price increases. Prices will slow, but I doubt we'll see substantial disinflation/deflation also (barring an awful crash).",

The first major hurdle on my part will be finances and what options I have.\nI've been doing some digging and am well aware that Toronto is an expensive city and that to maintain the quality of life I have in my home country it might require a fair amount of additional compensation.\n\nThe company is open to a discussion about the increase I would require for the duration, so I need to get a realistic handle on what to expect.\n\nSo anyway, onto my questions...What should my budget be for the following please:\n\n1 bed apartment in a reasonable suburb?\n\nMonthly food allowance? (I'm a big guy and eat a decent amount, but rarely get takeouts and mostly home cook food.)\n\nMonthly bills?\n\nTransport?\n\nGeneral recreation?\n\nAdditionally, I'm pretty familiar with your fine country, but are there any gotchas a potential expat would face which I should be aware of please?\n\nFinally, I'd like to apologise in advance if this comes across as tone deaf. I've been reading that the job market is poor and housing is expensive for everyone right now and I'd be adding to that issue, so I realise that might make this post leave a bad taste in some people's mouths, but if it's any consolation the role they're talking to me about has been vacant for quite some time because it's a particularly niche skill set and unfortunately has not been successfully filled by anyone inside the Canadian branch or outside in the wider market, which is part of the reason why they approached me despite my foreigner status, so at least I wouldn't be taking someone's potential job.\n\nThank you in advance to anyone taking the time to respond.",
