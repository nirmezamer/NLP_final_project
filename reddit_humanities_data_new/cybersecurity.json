But it often felt like I was taking stabs in the dark and hoping that the IOCs were useful to our ISAC members.\n\nAlso, how do you know when threat intelligence is actionable?

Seeing and bagging dead bodies, responding to domestic violence calls, dealing gang members, violent offenders, going to court, and getting shot at, longer fits my lifestyle. Investigating corruption is cool, and rewarding. But the assignments for that are few and far between in my area.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0My question would be, is it too late in the game for a career change?

Its hard to evaluate, for sure, but that\u2019s the thing with threat intelligence.

Where else is money being wasted? I think the justification comes across several point within the organization, buy-in, exercises, etc.   \n  \nPaying for intel is expensive and a whole bunch of other factors you have to justify through. I have personally done it by bringing intelligence into Purple Team exercises more deeply so even just working with what you have as best as possible seems to be a good course of action if the intel fails to meet criteria.   \n  \nYou have to do it accelerated as the intel decay's etc etc so having some automation is helpful.   \n  \nHow fast can we just make this intel actionable? filtering, correlation, etc  \n\n\n1.

            ">Most entry level positions in cybersecurity requires you to have 3-5 years cybersecurity experience..\n\nThis is both untrue based on personal experience and just 10 min of looking at analyst jobs open near me. Many of the jobs are looking for this experience:\n\nBachelor\u2019s degree in computer science, Information Technology, or a related technical field or: An Associate degree in Computer Science or related technical field plus 2 years of relevant work experience\n\nThis is aligned with my experience and everybody I know from my graduating class. We were are all able to find an analyst job with just our college degree and internship experience during college.\n\nWhat happens in most instances is people will work in these entry level analyst jobs for a few years. While working in these jobs you don't really learn anything beyond surface level understanding of anything. Then they apply for the very high demand senior positions that you should have a lot of technical skills for. Because you never really learned much beyond surface level you're very incompetent.\n\nThe people hiring are also normally from the same background and pretty incompetent. In general if you're able to just speak like you know things, you can get by without any deep knowledge. It's led to an environment where less than 10% of security professionals are actually effective. Blind leading the blind.\n\n>How do you suggest people learn?\n\nThis is hard. I'm still part of what I'd consider the blind. I feel like a paycheck thief. What's wild is that I know more than people in senior positions that are earning more money. I don't feel like there are many structured learning paths for digging deep below the surface. I've had great experiences with SANS. Taking FOR508 and obtaining my GCFA was amazing and helped me learn a lot about DFIR. I was able to use what I learned from that course to start digger deeper following my interest. SANS isn't really a great solution though because it's very expensive and not all orgs will be willing to pay for it.\n\nI've had the most success finding something that I think would be cool, then backtracking and learning everything I need to be able to accomplish it. Two things I wanted to do that gave me the motivation to learn more and dig deeper were: creating video game cheats that could bypass anticheat & creating harmless malware that could bypass windows defender so I could mess with friends.\n\nThese two goals lead to me learning some C, Python, and Assembly. Learning how malware is designed. How to obfuscate code and different kinds of encryption. Modifying malware to avoid signature based detections. How to avoid certain heuristic/behavior based detection. How to inject code into other processes. How Windows Defender works. Learning about intercepting and modifying game function calls.",

            "Hello everybody, went back to college after 9 years, decided to pursue cybersecurity analyst certificate before pursuing my cybersecurity degree, my college has a course where I take 2 semesters to get the certificate, it also counts as college credits. \n\nNow I don\u2019t know much about where to start on my free time when it comes to getting a headstart before the fall semester starts in august. I\u2019m current taking 1 class at the moment which is CIS-1 Intro to Computer systems. I have ADHD and have trouble taking notes and all.\n\nI have no experience in anything at the moment, just typing skills lol. \n\nAlso thought about the US NAVY for CTN.\n\nAdvice, recommendations where to start and all welcome.

            "Hello everyone. I am curious to hear opinions on the odds of getting an entry level cyber security job (leaning towards blue team) with no IT work experience, no degree in Cybersecurity (degree is in psychology) but with Google IT support professional certificate, Google Cybersecurity Certificate, CompTIA Security + certificate and blue team level 1 certificate. I have been reading and studying the field closely and listening to what others have to say and it seems like landing the first job is rough. I will not be discouraged by what anyone has to say I am all ears. Thanks.",

That\u2019s all. I know that neither of these things have much, if any weight, in the job market.

I have done a lot of studying for Comptia NET+, but I do not want to take both test and CCNA seems to be worth more.\n\nDecember : AWS Cloud Practitioner Foundational\nI am not sure I will be able to study for this one along with CCNA, so I might not be able to take in until next year\n\nNow onto my questions:\n\nHow does this sound?\n\nSince I am currently working in a SOC and can put that experience on my resume, should I even bother with SEC+?\n\nAre there any certs that you all recommend? \nI am still new to this world and there is a lot I don't know. So any help on what Certs are actually usefull would be great.\n\nI would also like to get Blue Team Level 1 (and 2), but I can\u2019t afford it and my company won\u2019t pay for any of these certificates. So those two will have to wait until next year, if I even go for them. I am not sure how useful they will be for the goal of working in cloud security.\n\nI also plan on getting a python certificate next year.\n\n \n\nPs.\n\nYou might all be wondering \u201cHow did he get a job in a SOC with no \u201clegit\u201d certifications?\u201d\n\nWell, I speak English and Japanese and the company I work for had just opened their SOC department and was looking for bilingual people. They have been \u201ctraining\u201d me up over the last few months. In short, I got lucky. I am sacrificing pay for practical experience, but I believe that it will work out in the long run",

            "Hi folks,\n\nHope y'all are well.\n\nI'll keep it short and sweet.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy background:\n\nRecent law grad (L.L.B) from South Australia who is seeking to swerve into cybersecurity GRC rather than the traditional lawyer route. To be clear I'm not a licensed law practitioner, and I don't plan to be one either (as off yet). The intensity of the workload in pure law was a bit much for my anxiety.\n\nAlways been a self learner so was naturally drawn to the mentality in cybersec. I'd been prepping for cybersecurity on the side because I had this idea in my mind that there's not many professionals in law with a Cybersec background and vice versa. So it just made sense to pick it up. Now my main goal is getting into a law-cybsec hybrid position. I find red, blue and purple equally interesting so I'm just keeping on open mind on that end.\n\nJust finished Google's cybersec professional cert. Currently prepping for CompTIA's S+ and maybe A+ and ISC2's CC. \nI also understand that it would be important for me to do courses on the most used compliance frameworks used in Australia. Not too sure how I'll be going about it just yet.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMain queries:\nGiven I have basically no cybersecurity work experience and I wish to enter GRC;\n\n1) What certs should I be doing? I've seen people gunning for CISSP but that requires prior work experience. So in particular, what are entry level certs for GRC (if there are such certs at all)?\n\n2) How would I go about leveraging my legal background in cybersec GRC? There isn't an entry role per say that I can see online. So I'm imagining I have to work my way up to a GRC position. But how does one do so with my background? What would like look like?\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOpen to any other recommendations and being educated on other perspectives.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nP.S. Maybe I lied about it being short. My bad G",

I'm going to study Computer Science with a year in industry, and from what I've heard, they usually push you towards jobs related to software engineering, as that's what gets good money.\n\nI'm more passionate about cybersecurity myself. I've done a bit of TryHackMe and competed in a GCHQ led course/competition which has confirmed my future ambitions. I am willing to work hard and put in the extra effort, but I'm not sure where to direct it.\n\nSo, my question is, how can I break in to the industry? Ideally landing my year in industry internship in a job related to cybersecurity. Should I go straight for it?

            "Made a post on this sub, but think automod wants me to comment here instead.\n\nAnyway, I want pivot from my current role to GRC and am wondering how to do that.\n\nFor a brief overview of my background I have a CS degree and graduated in 2021. First \"SWE\" job from 2021-2022 was kind of a bait and switch, didn't learn much there. Next job 2022-2023 was a real SWE role. It was a startup that was having some problems so I left again after a year for a larger company which is my current role. \n\nIm now in the finance sector at a large company. Its a \"SWE\" job in name only. I wear a lot of hats but I do a lot of work related to release/project management, configuration, QA testing, and support. My team mostly deals with backend tools and infra.\n\nOne of my main responsibilities is handling coordination and communication of our deployments. Said deployments can be tricky and time consuming because there is a *lot* of red tape and bureaucracy. \n\nI essentially keep track of changes going out, kicking off build pipelines, and creating change requests. Change management here is super stringent and I do a lot of communication with them to ensure our shit actually gets released. \n\nWe cant just deploy whenever we want there are specific dates and times so I help keep track of that too and help the team with the insane emergency release process when we have do that.  \n\nMy other tasks tend to vary all over the place. Ive helped a lot with sonarqube CVE related items (typically code library upgrades), QA testing, and support work. Some config/automation work using proprietary automation software (yes that is as awful as it sounds) \n\nThe WLB is shitty and we regularly work 60+ hour weeks. Because its so difficult to push changes out, along with shoddy software that breaks all the time and insane expectations/deadlines from business makes this a tough role.\n\nFor GRC, my motivation longterm is to get into a non-technical role with better WLB. \n\nMy soft skills are solid and I also enjoy reading/writing documentation. Im fine with attending meetings. Im a routine oriented person and it sucks not knowing when im going to be done with the work day or what my schedule is gonna be like. Im ok if its a bit \"boring\" (honestly GRC sounds interesting to me).\n\nI know these jobs can vary a lot but from what ive read searching this sub GRC seems like a great fit for me.\n\nWith that said, what should I do next from here based on my career experience? I know certs like Sec+ and then CISSP are important, but what about working experience?\n\nI'd ideally like to leave this job sooner than later but I know a career pivot like this will take some time. Another thought was going the cloud/devops route for a bit while grinding certs then getting into GRC.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

I understand how networks and OS work (linux and windows) and as I said I do have 1-year on-hands helpdesk experience, but I am afraid that not knowing technical cybersecurity stuff will make it almost impossible for me to pass the exams.\n\nWhat would be the best path for someone like me to successfully shit careers to GRC? According to my research , I think CRISC is a potential career booster, and I can leverage my Internal Control experience to meet the 3-yr requirement. Maybe pursue CISM after that. \nMy mid-term goal is to become a Risk & Compliance Manager. Also, I do want to educate myself in technical stuff too so, what kind of technical certs should I get for that?

            "My original post got deleted, but here's a self reflection of my current state in Cyber. Any advice will be helpful.\n\nHey guys, currently I'm a student closing in on my Bachelor's in Cybersecurity. I graduate next year and so far I've held a 4.0 GPA (mainly to keep my full-ride scholarship), and I recently got the SecurityPro certification from CompTIA. However, in my 4 years or so of college and years of living, I haven't worked a job. I've tried a couple times to apply to retail, I've applied to several internships (remote, since commuting to a certain city would be torture), and haven't landed anything. Some more persistence would probably get me somewhere, but I think I'm afraid of change, possibly coupled with some laziness.\n\nIf I get a job and it turns out my classes are difficult, then I have less time to study and hold my 4.0. If I don't have a job by the time I graduate, then I have no experience and trying to find a job will be hell.\n\nI want to go for the Google Cyber certification as well as Sec+ since apparently there's a \"dual cert\" if I do that. I want to finish school first before going for the certs since I can fully focus on studying for the certs and not have to worry about the 3 discussion posts and 6 replies I have to do that week.\n\nI'd like to set up a home lab, but I know that certain labs are more significant and fruitful than others, so I'm at a loss of where to start in that department.\n\nI haven't done any cyber competitions, and I haven't done any CTFs. I either don't qualify for the cyber competition (due to lacking required or recommended knowledge/experience), or I just ignore them entirely. As for CTFs, I haven't made an effort to start them because laziness.\n\nOn one hand, I know I can tackle whatever it is I set my mind to. I don't think I'd have a 4.0 if that wasn't true in some way, but I lack direction and motivation I guess. School motivates me to do assignments due to the consequences of not doing them, so I work hard and ensure everything I turn in is nigh-perfect. I just fell like everything seems daunting, and I see other beginner/fresh-graduate posts who have done way more than me and it just makes my hard work in school feel worthless.\n\nI think laziness and procrastination are the source of my problems, since I can't motivate myself to do extra-curriculars and video games provide me with more enjoyment than the frustration of learning something new and sucking at it.\n\nIdk. I'm looking for advice, or words from those who are/were in a similar position as me. This post may just be pointless since I'm self-aware of my problems, but I would appreciate any sort of interaction. I really can't air out my thoughts to someone irl, so here I am.

This is consistent with the overall practice of having security serve the organization (vs. making the organization serve security).\n\nEverything else you named - while not inappropriate - feels preemptive without an established, formalized process that is both well understood and acknowledged by leadership. The risk you run in not doing the above groundwork upfront is that at some point someone might say \"no\" or \"why?\" (and you don't want to be in the position of saying things like \"best practice\" or \"that's just the way things are\").

You do the SOC type of work where you will face so many types of alerts that you either get good or be swallowed whole\u2026\n\nSince I\u2019ve already recommended the compliance side of things, I\u2019ll justify why I think the risk and governance reason would not be suitable for you NOW. (Because I know your law background could be tremendously helpful with some experience behind your belt.) Managing risk is about understanding the context of the system, evaluating what would be the impact of the risk being exploited and the potential of this happening. This requires IT experience to properly do. The governance side requires you have experience in IT to understand how what you\u2019re working on will implement the day to day of people. Aiming for the highest standards is well and all, but you are actively working on writing something that will be actionable and achieve the desired goals.\n\nNow, as far as certifications go, they are useful to have your resume looked at by HR. I would never hire someone only based on their certifications. I think your current plan makes sense. You can get a CISSP with no prior experience, you would be know as an associate if I remember correctly. When you have the proper experience you could then be recognized as a full CISSP holder. Go for the cybersecurity part of your plan (I would drop the A+).\n\n\nSo, the tldr of my recommendations: Compliance/auditing or law work to help IT teams would suit your degree. Keep your certification plan for now, it looks good for the cybersecurity part.",

On one extreme end you have folks involved with cryptography (and quantum algorithms), on the other you have folks on the periphery of the engineering space (e.g. sales, insurance, project management).\n\nAcademically? [I encourage undergraduates pursue degrees in Computer Science](https://old.reddit.com/r/u_fabledparable/comments/17xlmrc/cybersecurity_mentorship_references/k9oxryb/), which requires a non-trivial investment in studying math. However, CompSci is not a hard requirement to get involved in the field professionally.\n\n> in your opinion how good do you need to be at maths to be a good cybersecurity analyst?\n\nAs a domain that is rooted in engineering, I think you only stand to benefit by deliberately engaging the math that undergirds modern computing. It moves whole categories of problems from \"I'm helpless and can't do anything\" to \"I've seen something like this and I can figure it out, given time.\" It makes you more employable, more capable, and positions you to be in a better position than adversarial/malicious agents out there.\n\nWill you ultimately need to apply these intensive math intuitions/algorithms regularly? Probably not. But when the need to do so *does* arise (and it has several times in my career), it's incredibly useful.\n\n> Have you ever struggled on a task that involved maths?\n\nCertainly. Math is hard. It's hard for a lot of people.",
            "Welcome!\n\n> I graduate next year and so far I've held a 4.0 GPA (mainly to keep my full-ride scholarship), and I recently got the SecurityPro certification from CompTIA.\n\nGood job!\n\n> However, in my 4 years or so of college and years of living, I haven't worked a job.\n\nThis is *very* problematic, but at least you're aware that it's an issue.\n\n> I've applied to several internships (remote, since commuting to a certain city would be torture), and haven't landed anything. Some more persistence would probably get me somewhere, but I think I'm afraid of change, possibly coupled with some laziness.\n\nAs you say, these issues are all things within your ability to control. You can:\n\n* Make the commute; though it may be torturous (I can relate; at one point post-college I was making a one-way commute that took between 2-3 hours for several years), internships are seasonal - so you wouldn't be committing to doing this long-term.\n* Look for roles that aren't exclusively remote, which helps limit the competitive pool of applicants.\n* Either exercise some more diligence (if laziness is the root cause) or seek therapy (to equip yourself with the tools necessary to handle your anxiety around changing circumstances).\n\nAbsent the above, you might also look towards part-time workstudy within your university (as an intermediary alternative).\n\n> If I get a job and it turns out my classes are difficult, then I have less time to study and hold my 4.0.\n\nWhat are the terms of your scholarship, exactly? For example, if you get a sub-4.0 GPA what happens? Do you pay back the scholarship in its entirety? Does the scholarship cover room/board? Are you dropped from admission to the university?\n\nI ask because I want to know how much risk you might reasonably expect.\n\n> I want to go for the Google Cyber certification as well as Sec+ since apparently there's a \"dual cert\" if I do that.\n\nSee related:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/13hrkhr/comment/jkis9ew\n\n> I'd like to set up a home lab, but I know that certain labs are more significant and fruitful than others, so I'm at a loss of where to start in that department.\n\nI'd encourage you to frame your lab efforts more in terms of projects and less in terms of setting up a lab for the lab's sake.\n\nIn other words, you're going to want to be able to speak to what you've done with your lab (vs. saying you architected/built a lab just to say you did so). Structuring your efforts as such helps also with your labs' specifications and lessons you might learn along the way.\n\nFor example, if I asked you to [setup a honeypot to observe rogue SSH attempts](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/18zbzob/ssh_login_attempts_from_all_around_the_world/), how might you do that? And what then might we do to extend this project to be an interesting research effort? These are interesting experiences that implicitly require an appropriately configured lab environment.\n\nSee related:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/sxir9c/as_a_entry_level_professional_trying_to_get_into/hxsm5qn/\n\n> I haven't done any cyber competitions, and I haven't done any CTFs. I either don't qualify for the cyber competition (due to lacking required or recommended knowledge/experience), or I just ignore them entirely. As for CTFs, I haven't made an effort to start them because laziness.\n\nThat's fine. [Most aren't impactful/consequential to your employability.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackthebox/comments/11hs9hl/comment/jawng7p/?context=3&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=cybersecurity&utm_content=t3_142rs62)\n\nHowever, you are missing out on some really interesting problems, opportunities to exercise your practical application capabilities, and outside chances of rewards (e.g. [I was one of the 2022 finishers at the NSA's Codebreaker challenge](https://bytebreach.com/posts/nsa-codebreaker-challenge-2022-writeup/), which came with - among other things - solicitations of employment).\n\n> On one hand, I know I can tackle whatever it is I set my mind to. I don't think I'd have a 4.0 if that wasn't true in some way, but I lack direction and motivation I guess. School motivates me to do assignments due to the consequences of not doing them, so I work hard and ensure everything I turn in is nigh-perfect. I just fell like everything seems daunting, and I see other beginner/fresh-graduate posts who have done way more than me and it just makes my hard work in school feel worthless.\n\nMy $0.02: it looks like what you prefer is structure and instruction. When left to your own devices (i.e. pursuing employment, certifications, competitions, etc.), you falter.

Your assessment is actually quite accurate, now that I look at it; I've always had some sort of structure to guide me and now that I'm nearing the end of that part of my life, it's, frankly, a bit frightening. But you're definitely right. To answer your questions and concerns you posed:\n\n1. \"What are the terms of your scholarship?\"\n\nIf I fall below a 3.5, I lose the full ride and pay out of pocket, which would practically cause me to drop out. I commute, so no risk of homelessness or anything, but I'd like to not pay for college, haha. I could probably get away with B's and C's given how late it is in my college career and all the A's have racked up, but I personally want to keep my 4.0.\n\n2. As much as I'd like to being a home lab, your final observation puts a thorn in that plan; I need some instruction on how to go about it. I could \"just do it,\" and if I did, I wouldn't be very good at articulating WHAT (idk how to use italics on mobile) I did; if I was asked about a home lab, I'd say I did this, this, and that, but without instruction idk if I could explain how and why the home lab works, if that makes sense. I wouldn't even know where to begin without some sort of guide or walk-through. I think I need to find something that's practical and interesting, like you said.\n\nAgain, thanks for your response. I appreciate you taking the time to give me some hope and guidance.",

Could be a coincidence, but I felt that was the turning point. \n\nSimilarly I would like to progress with a masters degree and hence looking for a suitable program, but came to the thought of having a leadership oriented program like the ones I listed. \n\nNot thinking that just getting masters would do but I believe its a combination of lot of things along with the education that includes and not limited to networking, community knowledge sharing, gaining business knowledge along with the technical bits and a lot more.\n\nThanks for the link, I wouldn't be looking at the company sponsoring my education but would be exploring this option.",

You want to get the key stakeholders involved (i.e. no one will like policies affecting their work that they had no voice/awareness in its drafting, especially if it its detrimental to the workflow).\n\nThere's also something to be said about being aware of how your ROI is being perceived by the people responsible for deciding whether you should be retained/let-go. They have priorities/agendas for you - if you're not meeting those (and instead are campaigning for policy creation/adoption/enforcement), your tenure is probably going to be short.

I really liked how he applied real world solutions to real world problems; like bypassing MFA by just distracting the guy and looking at his authenticator app instead of using 'hacker magic'.\n\nThe results were often a bit implausible though. Like, you really knew what forensics software this shady organisation were going to use on your disk, and their forensic workstation was connected to their operational network in a way that let you pwn all of their infrastructure, doing all this recon and exploit dev alone in a miniscule timeframe? The 'we can blow up the building with computers' stuff was dubious too, but as a hacker series goes it wasn't too painful to suspend disbelief - especially if I watched it again knowing the twist.",
