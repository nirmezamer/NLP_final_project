            "I\u2019ve pretty much never played an MMO, opting for single player experiences instead.\n\nI wanna get into it, and I don\u2019t even mind crazy grinding. Just something with a pretty active player base, classic game style (ex. Fighting Bosses, Joining Groups, Talking To Players). \n\nMy big thing is that, being able to chat with people. And fight. That\u2019s about it.\n\nDND style, if that provides any sort of clarity.",
            "Are there any MMOs that aren't massive timesinks and don't have a ton of menial grinding tasks? I'm too busy to play an MMO with a big time commitment. Right now I'm playing a mobile territory clan game which is nice for the easy pick up and play aspect but the active gameplay is not satisfying since it's all idle task dispatching. Ideally I'd like an idle aspect to replace the grindy bits while still having a actual gameplay for when you can sit down and properly play.",
            "Looking for a game with a lot to discover, where information isn't widely available. Where I can make [stories like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJVRgun7M7c) simply because no one knew it would happen, as opposed to modern wow where all the fun is optomized out before I can even get to it",
            "I'm in the mood for an older, slower fantasy MMO that has a relatively active (talkative) community and isn't on the verge of shutting down. Bonus points if the UI and controls are easily modified to suit modern sensibilities.",
            "Looking for an MMO since New World went kaput, that would be the same style.",
            "Are there any mmos out there where the grind is not super boring / repetitive / etc ?\n\nWhat I mean is something for instance with procedural map generation so even if there's grind, its interesting with random or new things happening rather than going in a circle repeating the same content.\n\nOr maybe even if there's no precedural map, the game design is in a way where the grind is actually fun rather than tedious and boring.\n\nI am yet to find a MMO where grind does not fill like a tedius / excruciating chore",

            "Hello! Does anyone know of a game similar to Silkroad in terms of using bots? To give a brief explanation for those who haven't played it, you would create a party of 8 characters, which had to include a cleric, a warrior, and the damage dealers. You would set up the party so that each character fulfilled their role, and they would stay botting 24/7 to level up.\n\nThe game doesn't have to be an MMORPG; I'm just looking for something with that bot system where I can leave it farming and watch it \"auto-play.\" The closest I've found is Rusty's Retirement, but I'm looking for more games of that style.",
            "I\u2019ve never actually played an mmorpg although I do follow a little bit about what\u2019s going on with wow and had friends back in the day that played EverQuest (I\u2019m old). Funny enough, I just never had internet at home until I was an adult and just wrote it off as having missed the boat but they\u2019re still around so I\u2019m thinking I might give one a shot. \n\nEverQuest looks way too clunky so I\u2019m torn between wow and guild wars but I\u2019m open to any suggestions. I enjoyed the elder scroll games in the past so maybe eso would be a good pick too. \n\nWhat I do know that I want is something social and from the outside, it looks like that just isn\u2019t really the case anymore with a lot of games. I don\u2019t want silent side by side play that may as well be with a bot.",
            "Hello, I'm looking for a PvE-oriented MMORPG focused on small group content (around 5 players) with classic mechanics. I love playing as a healer.   \n  \nI prefer buy-to-play games with or without a subscription but with minimal in-game cash shop.   \n  \nI've played a lot of WoW but I'm looking for something new with less quest hub/fedex-style leveling. I really enjoyed SWTOR but the in-game store ruined the game for me. FF14 is nice but I find the gameplay quite slow. Guild Wars 2 is interesting but the lack of roles bothers me.   \n  \nDo you have any other alternatives to suggest? I like challenging games but without intensive farming.   \n  \nThanks !",

Current main mmo is GW2, love it, but crafting isn't all that there.\u00a0\n\n\nHave an account in BDO, the processing and crafting is too time consuming for me. Feels like it was made with the express purpose of people afking during it, and that kinda rubs me the wrong way.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso have an account in LotRO, just not sure if the game is still alive enough for trading. For instance, I want to be able to sell food, pots and stuff like that, not just gear.\u00a0",

            "Don't know if the rest of it will be to your taste, but GW2 can be enjoyed with pretty minimal grind beyond bis gear (hard requirement for one type of endgame pve content, the rest can be done in second bis but depends on your group).\u00a0\n\n\n1. The same bis gear for years, and won't ever change. Sometimes expansions give a better stat combo for your particular class and spec, but you can stat swap the bis gear for much cheaper than it takes to craft another set. Most specs have had the same bis stat for years now, too.\u00a0\n\n\n2. B2p with no subs and a long free trial with restrictions. You can get up to max level with the free trial, sadly the majority of endgame grouped instance needs paid version and can't be tried on a free account. But you have enough time to see if you like the core systems, combat, crafting etc and also get a taste of its open world metas which make up a large chunk of it's pve content.\u00a0\n\n\n3. Pretty much all grind beyond that first set of bis gear is optional and leveling is fast as well. You can grind for some mounts (one is visiting npcs and talking quests mostly, the other two require you to do some content but I wouldn't say any of those are hard grinds and with the exception of the talking quests, the other two mounts can be done without). You can grind for cosmetics, titles and legendary gear - but legendary gear has the same exact stats as the bis gear set you'll craft.\u00a0\n\n\n4. If you're not into instanced pve content and want to do open world pve content instead, there's a decent variety (imo) and you don't even need the bis gear. The second bis gear goes for super cheap on the marketplace for nearly all specs.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you decide to give it a try and are on EU, you can shoot me a dm if you need help or just some company while leveling.\u00a0",
            "I would say Albion online, depending on what your goal with an mmorpg is. But its perfectly playable and enjoyable without hours of grinding.",
            "You can potentially still do that in WoW (or any game receiving new content). Either be in the absolute most bleeding edge content-clearing guilds, or join one with a no-guide policy. It's not something you're going to experience without putting in effort...please don't underestimate just how few players were able to even *reach* C'thun when it was relevant content.\n\nBeyond that, I suppose your best option would be one of the completely new MMOs (not an Asian MMO port, since people will be referencing existing data for those). But you're still going to have to play hard to outrun the flow of information; there aren't any active online games where no one is talking about the content.",
            "Didn't New World go kaput over a year+ ago?",
            "I would recommend Albion Online if the top-down view isn't too off-putting for you. It is full-loot by design so the progression is silver/fame(exp) based rather than sticking to specific gear forever. However, the grind is some of the most fun i've had in a while and the transition from open world to instance-based areas is very smooth and engaging, even if you have to be on your toes for gankers all the time(unless you stick to non-pvp areasd but the loot will be less than what you get in PvP areas). This also makes grinding quite rewarding in loot and feeling. The word grind itself means it is still repetitive though so take my words with a grain of salt.",
            "lol i played the game when it originally came out, played it solo. Haha whats this creating 8 characters nonsense xD",
            "I never played it but I heard MIR4 is something like that, you can leave your character auto-hunting and only watch",
            "Why do you want a computer to play the game for u?",
            "I'll be honest - if you want to be social nowadays, you have to do a lot of the legwork. Most mmos I play now, guilds mainly do socialising on Discord. I rarely come across just hanging out in game, doing gathering or lazing through a dungeon or even just jumping around casually while we talk. But truthfully, as an adult I don't have much time to do that either, so maybe it's just on my end.\u00a0\n\n\nJoin a social guild, swap guilds if you think the current one isn't fitting your social needs, ask to do stuff together(non-combat activities mostly even when people rarely join you but even doing a lot of pve and pvp together might lead to people becoming friendlier) and try to engage people first without waiting for them to start a conversation. Even then a lot of people kind of just want to do their daily routines and go, so you might get dry answers a lot of the time. Dont take it personally and keep trying, even though it might feel embarassing to approach people first when so many don't seem interested.\u00a0\n\n\nI've had good experiences with guilds in GW2 and you can join 5 at a time. So you can join a guild for group finding and then other guilds for social activities if needed. But this doesn't mean that GW2 inherently pushes people together as much as some of the older mmos did. I'm not sure if WoW is better in that aspect.\u00a0\n\n\nI think if you're consistently grouping up with the same few guildies, you kind of establish enough of a rapport that gameplay no longer feels like rushing to get it done with silent players who might as well be NPCs.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe most social experience I've personally had in a modern mmo is probably FFXIV, with a robust rp community if that's your thing.\u00a0\n\n\nGood luck, hope you find the mmo you're looking for.\u00a0",

I'd rather feel like the whole community is discovering stuff instead of just going into raids blind, feeling like I'm dragging everyone else down \n\nAs for what other MMOs I could play, I don't actually know what those newer games could be.

            "Heard ppl say it didnt have content at launch but has it now. Can't speak for that but i started 2 weeks ago and i like it so far. Its only grindy if you want it to be, unlike other mmorpgs you arn't forced to do all the grinding."

Instead (theoretically, we still don't know much about this game) you'll be able to level up different skills separately. So for example, its not about your character level, but your level in 2H Swords that will give you new abilities.   \n  \nIf they'll take Star Wars Galaxies path - you won't have a story-driven MMO like many other Themepark MMOs have. Instead, the story is what you make of it, because you'll have a lot of freedom with your character. \n\n**Here are a few quotes from their latest teases:** \n\n\"What if... you could actually invent new things in an MMO?\"\n\n\"What if... there was a way to discover secrets in an MMO -- and no easy wiki holding all the answers?\"\n\n\"What if... it rained, creating puddles that froze overnight?\"\n\n\"What if... bad weather meant traveling through the mud?\""

I think my biggest problem with the game is all the classes play almost exactly the same.\n\nYou essentially get 7 skills:\n\nSkills 1-2 are basic generator for your class mechanic\n\nSkill 3-4 are stronger attacks with slightly longer CDs do more damage\n\nSkill 5 is AOE\n\nSkill 6 is self damage buff\n\nSkill 7 is ultimate\n\nThe skills pretty much function the same across all classes (Ex. Generator skills on warrior increase rage -> Spending rage on skills 3-4 = more damage, Generator skills on rogue increase poison -> spending poison mechanic on skills 3-4 = more damage.)\n\nAlso you don't have many skills, which is fine, but there's really not much thought behind why you are using them. If the skill has a CD you are most likely pressing it off CD no matter what. This turns combat into just a spammy mess where you are staring at your action bar making sure to press the buttons that light up as they come off CD.\n\nI have no input on the P2W/lore/social/exploration. The gameplay/combat is just way too mobile(simplified) to get past.\n\nI don't want to seem bias so I'll throw some positives out - the UI is extremely clean and the entire thing can be customized (target frames etc.) Built-in damage and healing charts are pretty cool too.

            "I've only played for a little bit this morning, but so far my biggest gripe is that the camera seems to be actively fighting me at times.  It's so hard to just look around in this game.  I saw an icon on the map but didn't see anything around me, so I thought maybe it was above me.  It's actually hard to look straight up, or as close to straight up as the game lets you.  It keeps trying to refocus back to a gameplay angle, so I wind up moving my mouse way further up on my desk then in any other game.  And that's when I'm stationary.  Moving resets it sometimes, other times it doesn't reset the view but suddenly my character is now moving that way even though I was left clicking which most of the time only rotates the camera.  I gave up looking for the thing.. and I'm not even sure what it was because the minimap has no mouseover or interaction at all, and the icon didn't show up on the main map.\n\nIf the rest of the game is great then small things like that wind up mattering less.  But so far I've only seen small things that slightly suck, and not a lot of cool features.  I haven't played enough to write it off and do plan on playing more, but it definitely could have made a stronger first impression.",

It doesn't matter what you do, it will always be the default one.\n\nThe movement and combat are also very rough, i was playing gw2 minutes before the tarisland servers were open, then i hopped into the game and felt like something was VERY wrong, obviously i don't expect the same level of movement as gw2, but it was just too rough around the edges for me, even vanilla wow(which i am currently playing at turtlewow) has a better feeling to it.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if a game is released day one on both pc and mobile, it's a mobile game, and tarisland certainly fits that bill. Albion online is also available on mobile, but the initial game release took place in 2017, while the mobile version only came out in 2021, and the gap in the quality of both games certainly shows the difference between \"mobile port\" and \"mobile game on pc\".\n\nApparently the ingame purchases are exclusive to each character, and not account bound.

            "Honestly, the only thing that's gonna keep me playing is the classes and the dungeons. Challenge mode and the class I (male wizard) play are surprisingly tight. \n\nI will say the way the game introduced you to raids and party style dungeons is pretty innovative and more games should do it. Even though it feels very low effort and low budget.\n\nWizard is surprisingly in depth, fire and frost play very differently and talents change the entire rotation and play style in some cases, and the augmentation (I forgot the name) is essentially a Diablo/poe esque talent tree so there's quite a lot of choices and content there.\n\nThe dungeons feel good. Like really good. Mechanics that make you actually engage and interact at least for a leveling dungeon. Challenge mode was a lot more difficult than I thought it would be, I don't see how anyone could clear library cm on mobile. One mistake will wipe the party. You have to space out the dot cleanse so you have to position yourself to use the portal at 30 stacks or higher. Cage mechanics on the second boss were aids since there's so much aoe and people die fast. Had a ton of fun doing it.\n\nOverall I was pretty disappointed though with everything else. This really is the worst of the genre. Dog shit mtx ($45 USD costume, $2500+ skin from loot box gambling unless you get stupid lucky with orange dupes, $21 CHARACTER specific battle pass and mounts,) ai translation, zero effort translation where it's not AI (the prince of the second city calls the girl his daughter when she's his sister...the text even says sister,) zero quality control, the story gets progressively worse due to translation errors and voice acting errors and effort, the genshin style \"exploration\" is absolutely braindead and the puzzles have zero effort like having to buy a cash shop item to burn vines off a chest and the notes have 3 words out of 6 paragraphs voiced so you have to open them to understand then and of course the translation makes 90% of them illegible, archeages labor system is in for professions and it's somehow 10x worse with gathering one plant taking up like half an hours worth of labor (called vigor.)\n\nI'll definitely play it for the honeymoon phase but Its hard to say how end game will play and how p2w it will be since they are unlocking a little more everyday.",
            "The game represents the worst in this genre. First off, its typical Chinese theft. So much directly ripped from other MMO's, right down to the races. Tauren from WoW, and Hrothgar from FF14, swift spectral tiger in the mount store etc. There is still a ton of Chinese text in the game, the localization is terrible with voice acting not matching the subtitles, or timing of their speech.\n\nPC optimization sucks - no ability to rebind keys to side or middle mouse buttons, and my game keeps entering windowed mode anytime a cutscene starts. Monetization is predatory and deceitful - battlepass and rewards are CHARACTER SPECIFIC with no indication thats the case until after you've made the purchase.\n\nThe aesthetic is undeniably beautiful, and the combat isn't too bad considering its basically a mobile game. But seriously, we shouldn't be supporting this type of garbage.\n\nEDIT: This sub and the Tarisland subreddit are absolutely FULL of bots/devs posting garbage posts hyping up the game.

Since it changes from class to class (and spec to spec) I guess it doesn't fit your narrative of all classes playing exactly the same? Just to give a couple of random examples: DPS Bard's gives you a random chord effect after every single musical note cast, and you can cast Chord Score after every note. | Healer Necro's turns your ST main heal into an AoE one for the duration + it gives a boosted DR effect if Soul Link is active. (\"ultimate\" is not even the correct term btw, as the game calls \"ultimates\" the general utility spells like blink, dash, etc for some reason).\n\n- If you think general gameplay is just mindlessly spamming every spell as soon as it comes off of cooldown you're gonna have a really bad time in any challenge mode group (or even just Elite dungeons honestly). I've seen people play like that and, surprise surprise, their damage at the end of the dungeon always turns out to be atrocious.\n\n- \"*The gameplay/combat is just way too mobile(simplified) to get past*\": Literally evaluating the first 30 min of a MMORPG and basically its first dungeon (which, btw, for being your \"real\" first dungeon with other players, Library is extremely mechanics-rich).

While some things might feel very similar right now for some classes (again, we're talking about the first 30 min of a MMORPG), just looking at future talents and even just the core skills the specs offer, you can see things do branch off quite a bit. It's not peak depth of course (was never meant to be, this thing has to run on mobile too afterall), but even now managing buffs, procs and cd timing do play a pretty big part in how you approach fights (mainly challenge mode and the hall), and those do change the feel from class to class.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> I can\u2019t imagine someone playing just any two random dps specs in the current state of the game and feeling like they are unique\n\n[Literally any DPS spec] \u2260 DPS Bard",

Oh boy I love when my decisions have no consequences and my character is not a \"character\" but a doll I just slap skills and items on! Oooh, I can't wait to be a \"DPS\"!\n\n>What if\u2026 it rained, creating puddles that froze overnight?\n\n??? I mean it's cool to have weather effects but unless this has some kind of gameplay implications it doesn't really matter.\n\nAnd so on.\n\n\"But it's Raph Koster! He made Ultima Online!\"\n\nAnd good job on that, but all these \"What ifs\" describe a game that is very obviously NOT Ultima Online so I don't know why that would matter.",

Most are fine with a few years of hype-building. But too many MMOs start marketing the moment they have a vague idea about what game they are making, and then 7 years later they are talking about maybe launching an Alpha test next year(and then proceed to delay that).",

            "Apparently you don't play many games then. I have seen countless games go into early access on Steam only to barely ever change at all. And why would they? They've already made their money, it would be stupid to continue developing a product that's already been sold, unless it is for further monetization like an expansion/DLC/cosmetics etc. So they wisely just start work on another product to do the exact same thing again.\n\nAlso, the mobile market is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy worse than the MMO market when it comes to exploitative monetization tactics.\n\nAll of that said, even if you were correct, it \\*makes sense\\* for the MMO genre to be the worst off when it comes to these things because they generally take the most amount of money and staff, have the biggest worlds and the most amount of content. They are too big for their own good, really. AND on top of that are expected to continue providing constant updates. Ultimately, comparing it to any other genre is kind of unfair/silly.",

Worlds that feel like places instead of cardboard sets? Worlds that don\u2019t lock you into rigid gender locked classes with endlessly repeating hotkey cycles? Worlds where we use the power of modern computers to actually simulate a bit more, instead of everything being static content you use up, the way we dreamed MMOs would evolve all those years ago?\n\nThat\u2019s the thing we are chasing. We may not hit it all \u2014 in fact, I guarantee we won\u2019t.",

            "Could you elaborate a bit more on how developers shouldn't obfuscate mechanics?  I see obfuscation as a pacing mechanism and it exists on a spectrum.  Too little obfuscation means everything is just given to the player, which makes the game too easy or too quick to complete.  Too much, and it's just way too confusing or difficult.  Perhaps you meant something else, because in this context I think a good amount of obfuscation is healthy, as it allows for the player to feel pride in earning what they accomplished, instead of the game just \"giving\" the player everything.",

            "Yeah, we'll never get back to the good parts of MMOs with the good parts of modern ones. But for me, i've been enjoying FF14. The roulette system they have where you can join a dungeon and team up with people anytime you want is pretty great. it's really social game too, so you can easily find and make friends as well. \n\nAs much as I'd love to play an MMO like we see in animes based on MMOs, we just don't have that. FF14 is as good as it'll get for me right now. If I didn't have to work and do other stuff, I could see myself easily no lifeing this game. The story mode part is single player, but there's a ton of dugeons and stuff that need teammates. Even in the story mode, you'll often come across dungeons that you have to do with others. Some of them you get the option to do it with NPCs or people, some you have to do with other people.\n\nAnd if you want to do stuff in the open world, you can very easily gather some friends or strangers and do the open world missions called FATEs. There's hundreds if not thousands of them all over the game world you can do. and there's plenty of non-combat stuff. you can on ocean fishing expedition with a bunch of people which is pretty fun. and then sell, cook, or dismantle the fish for materials.\n\nIt took me 4 tries to get into the game, but it was worth it. Once you get past the first few hours and the game opens up, you can find a good MMO in there. the graphics update is happening like next week too, but even then the game already looks decent. Not like BDO or something, but it's good enough. and the art direction is great, it's Final Fantasy afterall.\n\nI've been playing MMOs myself for...ugh 26ish years since i was a kid. and yeah, 99% of MMOs are just bleh. and the great ones are dated, but this one hits the spot for me...even though it took giving it a chance like 4 different times...lol",

Or they need to pool their resources and actually recreate what they had. \n\nJust like the Monsters and Memories team is doing by the way, but the fact that they are the only ones should be a huge embarrassment to any other jaded MMO veteran..",
            "Mate, Steam shovelware doesn't count - you can find thousands of shitty examples in any genre. I'm obviously talking about semi-relevant and high profile games, so you can actually make the comparison to MMOs. \n\nTo make a more apt comparison for such a distinguished gamer like you (because apparently I don't play many games), it doesn't matter if Steam has 50 shovelware soulslikes from unknown developers, when in the last few years we've got at least 10 good quality ones. \n\n> Also, the mobile market\n\nMobile games are not a genre? But I'm glad the bar is this low.\n\n> All of that said, even if you were correct\n\nCan you sound more obnoxious and argumentative? I'm not feeling it yet.\n\nThat being said, I have no idea what your paragraphs have to do with what I said. I made an observation that most MMOs that come out have tons of issues. It doesn't matter that they're expensive to make, my observation is true. If you look at the 4x, FPS, ARPG, simulator, city builder, or any other genre that I can think of, you get lots of semi-relevant to high profile games that are very well made.",
            "Ralph, my first MMO was SWG. Nothing has ever really come close to replacing it, some just being better distractions than others.\n\nI really hope yall have been cooking up something good.",
            "Yeah, I can understand people wanting to only hear about the game shortly before release, but it's not realistic. At least unless you're huge company that has direct line to every gaming media outlet and can whip up incredible hype within a few months.\n\nGood to hear that you've been working on the game for a while, means that you might be able to release before either Star Citizen or Ashes of Creation. Certainly going to keep an eye out for your announcement at the end of the month.",
            "I made the bottom comment. I really hope that I'm wrong. But I know how this ends.\n\nEither someone delivers a theme park that will run out of content and die or maybe survive as f2p crap (SWTOR - I'm looking at You)\n\nOR someone deliver sandbox that will scare casual players and game will die.\n\nI still believe that You have to build a theme park experience on top of the sandbox. But that's just my opinion. You need to give people a guide into the sandbox experience.\n\nAnother thing I always notice is that everyone puts effort into combat, but crafting is just some shitty UI, while the entire idea of sandbox is to be what You want to be. If you make a trader or crafter or whatever - that gameplay loop should be as interesting as combat roles.\n\nAnother thing I know is that people usually need financial backing unless they are rich. So they take investors. And what do investors want in return? Money. Lots and lots of money. So, what is the first thing I see in a new MMO? Cosmetics - part I enjoy is turned into a shitty online store. And funny enough - people defend this shit like it's normal.\n\nThis is why I play 20-year-old MMO. This is why I do not believe in anything anymore. The MMO genre died, and nobody knows how to revive it. And if they know - they are not allowed to do it. Investors will not risk paying for something that has not been done before because they are afraid they lose money. But they will gladly invest in another WOW clone despite the fact they all died. But somehow, they still think that's the way forward.\n\nJust look at New World. Crafting-based colonization game where You explore a new continent? That's awesome. Some smart ass figured out that the best way forward is to turn it into a zombie game (because killing natives is not PC), and it has to be theme park-like WoW despite the fact that theme parks die fast. They got what they wanted, and what happened? The game is dead.\n\nWhat was the definition of insanity? Trying same thing over and over again expecting different results?",

            "> Town-sims I genuinely don't even know what they are lol. Like Black and White?
