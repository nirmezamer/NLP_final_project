            "VAG has many different synthetic fuels development programmes as do many other companies, like Bosch.  \n  \nThe key point is that gasoline chemical mixture is heavily defined in regulations, so it doesn't matter if it's FIA generic approved renewable fuel ([certified in 2020 for F1 use](https://www.fia.com/news/fia-introduces-sustainable-fuel-formula-1-and-commits-becoming-carbon-neutral-2021-and-net-zero)), synthetic fuel, e fuel or what ever green washing Aramco will pull (think the difference between gray, blue or green hydrogen definitions).\n  \nAs the chemistry is largely the same as the anti knock calculation the performance difference between various suppliers is relatively minimal around ~20hp currently.  \n  \nRed Bull is currently with Exxon conglomerate, who does their own development of various eFuels.",

            "I don't think they'd make some drivers magical, maybe the gap could be closed, but the inherent feeling for a car and intuitive understanding how to drive around certain issues would give the handful of \"special\" drivers an edge over other drivers.  \n  \nIt's similar to driving assist technologies in road cars, they help regular drivers, but professional drivers want to experience the natural limits of the chassis, tires and engine so they disable it and are faster than drivers with assistance systems, with pre-programmed  behavior and limitations.",
