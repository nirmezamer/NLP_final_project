Establishing this security baseline at the tenant level puts in place additional security to protect your cloud investments and company.\n\nMFA is a security method commonly required among cloud service providers and requires users to provide two or more pieces of evidence to verify their identity before accessing a service or a resource. It adds an extra layer of protection to the standard username and password authentication.\n\nThe roll-out of this requirement will be gradual and methodical to minimize impact on your use cases. The blog post below provides helpful information from the Azure product team to assist you in getting ready to MFA-enable your access to Azure services. Going forward, the team will provide communications to you about your specific roll-out dates through direct emails and Azure Portal notifications. Expect these in the coming months.\n\nRead on to learn why and how MFA is important to securing customers on Azure and your workloads, environments, and users.\n\nIf you do not want to wait for the roll-out, set up MFA now with the MFA wizard for [Microsoft Entra](https://aka.ms/EntraIDMFAWizard).",

Exchange Online does not support bulk or high-volume transactional email. We have not enforced limiting of bulk email until now, but we plan on doing so with the introduction of an External Recipient Rate (ERR) limit. The ERR limit is per user/mailbox and being introduced to help reduce unfair usage and abuse of Exchange Online resources.\n\nWhat about the Recipient Rate Limit?  \nExchange Online enforces a Recipient Rate limit of 10,000 recipients. The 2,000 ERR limit will become a sub-limit within this 10,000 Recipient Rate limit. There is no change to the Recipient Rate limit, and both of these will be rolling limits for 24-hour windows. You can send to up to 2,000 external recipients in a 24-hour period, and if you max out the external recipient rate limit then you will still be able to send to up to 8,000 internal recipients in that same period. If you don't send to any external recipients in a 24-hour period, you can send to up to 10,000 internal recipients.\n\nHow will this change happen?  \nThe new ERR limit will be introduced in 2 phases:  \n. Phase 1 - Starting Jan 1, 2025, the limit will apply to cloud-hosted mailboxes of all newly created tenants.  \n. Phase 2 - Between July and December 2025, we will start applying the limit to cloud-hosted mailboxes of existing tenants\n\n**February 2025**\n\n\u2022 \\[Windows\\]\u00a0[KB5014754](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/kb5014754-certificate-based-authentication-changes-on-windows-domain-controllers-ad2c23b0-15d8-4340-a468-4d4f3b188f16)\u00a0Certificate-based authentication changes on Windows domain controllers\u00a0\u00a0| Phase Full Enforcement Mode.

            "Want to introduce/lower your idle workstation timeout? It's called desensitization.\n\nStorytime.\n\nWe didn't have a workstation locking policy at all at our company. Most likely a janitor was caught after hours using a computer for something they shouldn't, so IT communicated to executive management that we wanted to implement a 30 minute idle lock.\n\nWe had a Finance Director was that a real hard ass and hated IT for some reason, but had more power in the company than the IT Director. She insisted on a 90 minute idle lock policy so her employees could go to lunch and come back without having to re-enter their password. IT Director knew he'd lose the battle, so he agreed to the 90 minutes, as it was better than nothing at all, and at least they would eventually lock after hours. So we implemented the ridiculously long idle lock policy via Group Policy.\n\nEvery workday, I would come in and adjust the policy setting down by one minute. Slowly over weeks and months the workstation would lock at incrementally lower idle times until after about 3+ months later we were sitting at 15 minutes.\n\nOnly one person noticed and didn't really care.\n\nCaution: This behavior can be a resume generating event depending on how strict your organization is, but this company was pretty casual, and I was young.",

I was walking back to our IT area, where my sys admin group was also near the app/dev teams who supported all of the software.

I walked by their cube/laptop to see it widely unlocked, AND the program they had actively open was SQL browser into database with student records/grades.

My two favorites were one sales guy who was a republican (back when it was ok to have your politics known) but mostly a big fan of George Bush - so he got his wallpaper set to Obama. The other was a lady who I couldn't think of anything terrible, so I set her wallpaper to the original American Gladiators ([ex](https://images.launchbox-app.com/147db02f-ae5f-4ecd-847a-530cf82cb767.jpg)) which happened to be the theme of some of our conference rooms - she actually loved it and kept it.\n\nI'd also walk around the office during all hands and pick up badges left around the office.

People eventually learned.\n\nThe trick is to make it fun and light hearted and not to punish people. Even with Phishing tests today, I get people who are genuinely upset they fell for something.

We've automated the entire flow end to end. Even writing our own APIs for the application developers to integrate in their code to optimize our deployments, monitoring and reliability of the products in production.\n\nNow leadership wants to reorg (or breakup) our team and move us to other operations/application teams around the company to help them with automating their work flows but while I've been chatting with the managers or leads I'm finding very few admins have any knowledge of development or coding, beyond some scripting.  \n\nSo here's my question. Do you think it is feasible to expect a system admin or folks in operations to learn how to code?
