Like someone else mentioned, subs can choose to ban users who delete their posts, but they can't prevent that deletion in the first place. Like it or not, reddit users have the right to delete posts. It's a big part of what makes reddit what it is. There are wikis, docs, hell even man pages for people to contribute to if they prefer helping the community as a whole rather than individuals. But reddit is not intended to be a repository of knowledge. You wouldn't complain about the lack of upvote functionality on wikipedia, or the lack of youtube videos on sci-hub, because those are clearly not the intended purpose of those sites.

            "> But I think that might be more of a reddit problem in general to be honest.\n\nIt's not a reddit problem *per se* it's a problem with allowing self-editing and revisionism. If you give users the ability to make what they post impermanent, they will take advantage of that, usually selfishly with no consideration of how it affects others.  I've seen old internet stuff, like early webcomics, essays, prose, rants, etc. just disappear completely because the author decides they're ashamed of the old work, or they \"can do better now\" so they wipe out the old work completely for a reboot.  The history gets removed even if people liked that original work, and sometimes the new work is inferior or never gets completed at all. \n\nIt can happen outside of internet content, too.  Look what happened to the original Star Wars trilogy over the years: countless re-releases with tweaks and changes, and the deliberate obsolescence of old versions by not moving them to newer formats, making the replacement the only obtainable version.  \n\nVideo games have gone in this direction as well, thanks to Steam.  In the past you had access to a snapshot of the old game versions in the form of the release media and any standalone patches, but with Steam's update mechanism, you're forced into the newest version at all times with no way for people to just go \"nope, don't like this\" and stick to old versions and play the game with other people that feel the same way. Devs will completely upend their game design on a whim now, because what are you going to do about it?  You already paid and it's not like you can play the old version.\n\nAnyway, back to the original point:  if you let people edit/remove their content, it will happen, because some people don't give a fuck once they get what they want, and others just endlessly want to tinker and tweak and edit.  Other than blocking removal/editing completely (e.g. the Slashdot solution, which sucks for its own reasons), the only real protection against that kind of revisionism is to either provide some kind of version history of changes, or only allow changes within a short window of creation.  Like maybe you can edit your post or comment for an hour after posting it, in case you need to fix errors or catch a typo, but once that time is up it's set in stone, barring admin interaction (for possible legal reasons).",

            "I didn't say \"RTFM\\*\" (not that I don't ever, but that's another topic), I provided a quite descriptive link to relevant information.\n\nThis is 2021, not 1921.  Folks are mostly reasonably literate, there's The Internet, and folks should well be able to read how a link is described, and follow it if they want the relevant details of that information, or not if they'd rather not see or be bothered with those details or maybe they're already thoroughly familiar with those details and following the link would be highly redundant for them and a waste of their time.\n\nI'm not lecturing in front of a class of 100, or publishing a chapter in a book here in a required class in 1921.  Sure, I could lecture/type on about the details and information and explain ... and have everyone sit and listen/read through that ... but that would take up everyone's time and resources, even if it's not relevant or useful to them or they're not interested.  Likewise I could type up such a descriptive text here - but again, that would oft be relatively wasteful of many folks time/attention, when a link would do quite nicely and concisely - and they could follow it for more information if they wanted/needed - or skip it if they already well know and are familiar with it, or just aren't interested.  I'm also not in situation where I've got even 25 students that are stuck in classroom having to listen to me whether they want to or not - we're here, they don't have to read *whatever* or follow links, or even come to the replies on this post, or this subreddit, or Reddit, or heck, even The Internet.  So not good to put a bunch of text up that may be of little to zero interest to some or maybe even many.  In lots of cases some relevant link(s) or the like, and much less text (or merely good description/text of the link itself) will quite well suffice and is often the much better alternative.\n\n\\*And even often/typically when I do, it's typically accompanied by link and/or reference(s) to the relevant man page(s).  So it's not like someone's asking how to get to the local zoo and I'm dropping them off in the maps section of the local library - it's more like I'm handing 'em a link to a map thats shows them where they are, where the zoo is, and gives detailed directions on how to get from where they are to where the local zoo is.  And, with doing that and semi-regularly encouraging that, many will also well learn how to be able to do that themselves and learn how to look it up themselves and get the rather to quite readily available information for themselves.  And yes, sure, folks need to learn stuff and be taught stuff ... but one of those key skills is being able to well look up and fine readily available information, and to utilize and learn from that.  And also in that way, more limited teaching/mentoring etc. resources can well be applied to additional/more critical things ... like well covering things that can't just be looked up.",

I did hilariously find a stackoverflow question where someone else *who was following the same documentation as I was* had the *exact* same problem but all the responses were just arguing about whether adding to the gemfile was really the best way to go about accomplishing the task. And they were suggesting alternative ways. OP was responding with \"I am just trying to follow the instructions as written\" but neither of us got the answer in the end. \n\nI have also recently noticed a clever kind of top search engine hit where a tutorial-style article is presented but once you get to the bottom you find out it's an ad for a company wanting to sell you a service. So say you search for info about keeping backups, there is an article about various programs that will subtly emphasize the complexities of them. Then at the bottom it says, \"But if that sounds like too much trouble, pay us to do it.\" Sometimes these are helpful as springboards. \n\n> And nearly everyone would be dumbstruck at the idea that Google takes operators like site:, and would have no ckue how to use them effectively.\n\nI was talking to someone recently with a recent journalism degree and mentioned doing a `site:` search casually but they had no idea what I was talking about. Then on questioning it turns out they had never heard anything about any 'google fu' or non-basic searching. I incorrectly assumed that would be the kind of thing would be included in 4 years of training in a profession of finding information.",

I wanted it to be an everything laptop. Games, SteamVR, and the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Bad idea. Laptops aren't that expensive. I now wish I'd bought a few cheaper systems for their own purpose. But here I have this expensive ol' thing with pretty OK specs. It's full of Alienware everything. Almost like half Windows 10 Pro, half Alienware. I wanted it to power my Steam VR games with my old Vive Pro. But now I use the Meta Quest 3 and have a desktop that can power Steam VR both on my old timey Vive and on my Quest.

I had an Ubuntu laptop as my main daily computer for about 3 years, and tragically it was stolen about 5 years ago. I seriously think about that laptop a lot. The simplicity. The no BS performance. Living on the command line. Not Windows. Especially not Windows 11.  \nMy usage/wishlist would be:\n\n1. Lots of cloud infrastructure design and building. AWS, Azure, etc. Automation scripts. Nothing performance heavy.\n2. Code reviews. Administrative oversight. Approving merge requests. No Microsoft software except VSCode. For Azure I have a secondary Windows box to do PowerShell and MSSQL if we ever choose to use those. Emails, documents, correspondence.\n3. Steam VR that I occasionally pipe to my Meta Quest via Steam Link. It's fairly supported on Ubuntu.

The Universal Blue Discord community is also exceptionally supportive. Notable Universal Blue variants include Bazzite for gaming enthusiasts, SecureBlue prioritizing security and privacy (albeit with potential app compatibility issues), and standard images for those seeking a dependable, minimalist desktop experience. If Universal Blue intrigues you, I suggest giving it a try; if you need help, just hop on their Discord. If you prefer a more standard experience, go for Ubuntu or Fedora.",
