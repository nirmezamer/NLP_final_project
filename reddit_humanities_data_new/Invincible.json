It will always be my main defining project, the one most important to me. \n\nAfter Invincible I moved on to Marvel and did a run on Amazing Spider-man, and then a run on Hulk.

            "hi ryan! love your work! any tips for aspiring comic artists regarding composition and communication of what the writer wants for a scene?",

            "What are some of your favorite current and all-time favorite comic book series?",
            "From Skybound Insiders user kaeman22:\n\n>Huge fan of your artwork! I\u2019m curious, what\u2019s your favorite piece you\u2019ve ever drawn, whether it be related to Image, Marvel, at a con or even a personal piece!",
            "Hi Ryan! What was the most technically difficult panel you created for the comic?",
            "You've mentioned Tech Jacket was your main drive to work with Kirkman, so besides him, who's been the secondary character you've enjoyed drawing the most in Invincible ? Be it Brit, Capes Inc , Wolf-Man or the second roster of the Guardians of the Globe(Best Tiger, Shapesmith, Yeti, etc.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lvlwcvpwl3d1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=38b7cb0a5aaf1815e808025169d7769f40aa90bd",
            "Thanks for coming here to answer questions Ryan, and thanks for being part of our favorite comic book series! \n\nWhen taking over art for a comic book that is still new, but has already established a look and feel, how do you tread your own path forward while respecting what came before? Is there anything you would have done differently in the transition to your issues from Cory's with the hindsight and skill you have now?",
            "From Skybound Insiders user Cth42:\n\n>If you were given carte blanche, what crossover/team-up would you like to see happen with INVINCIBLE? Bonus points for any details!",
            "From Skybound Insiders user CamyFumi:\n\n>Hi Ryan, I was wondering how you get yourself into your own zone/mindset for drawing. A specific routine, music, maybe even food? I'd love to know!",
            "What was your favorite battle in the series?",
            "Hi Ryan, huge fan and absolutely adore the series. When you first started working on the series in the early/mid 2000's, did you ever in your wildest dreams see the series becoming such a hit, and when was that moment? How does it feel to see Invincible break into the mainstream and become a huge part of pop culture?",
            "Hi again Ottley! I had a wonderful time meeting you back at FANEXPO, it was amazing getting to talk to you.\n\nI (and I\u2019m sure many others), admire your appreciation for the cosplayers in the fandom. Hours can go behind creating these costumes as well as the amount of love that goes into them.\n\nMy question is, what was it like to see Invincible cosplays break out onto the scene, and the increase of them after the show? I can imagine it can be pretty surreal seeing characters you\u2019ve drawn for over a decade walking around convention halls. What are some of your favorite experiences?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bgc9yuf87m3d1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6157a7653c7500c69bd26b54733aa29eb0711bb\n\nThanks again!",
            "which arc are you proudest of art-wise? low hanging fruit but the shot of mark breaking conquest's gauntlet in #64 has to be my favorite panel in the series",
            "Howdy Ryan! Huge fan of your work on Amazing Spider-Man! What was going through your head when Marvel first asked you to work on such an iconic character?",
            "Any word on whether or not Tech Jacket will appear in the show?",
            "https://preview.redd.it/37435v183m3d1.jpeg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23555f7f50efb0a6dd342181261a60139d5acee0\n\nI know that you like putting little easter eggs and characters from different series in the panels. For example in issue 58 you had a panel with Brock Sampson and Dr. Venture from The Venture Bros.\n\nWere you just able to do whatever for the background characters? Who\u2019s your favorite(s) that you were able to put in?",
            "What would you consider to be your work that you\u2019re most proud of? A lot of people would assume Invincible due to its success but I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s anything you\u2019ve worked on that holds a special place in your heart.",
            "As an aspiring illustrstor, what are some ways you overcome artblocks? It\u2019s been quite difficult coming up with ideas in my head.",
            "From Skybound Insiders user They Live:\n\n>Hi Ryan I got to meet you at LA Comic Con and just wanted to say it was really nice talking to you! How do you feel about seeing the art you drew years ago becoming memes now? Was it a surreal experience? Did you ever think this would happen?",
            "Ryan, I have to ask you the hard question. When you got the script for issue 110 what was your reaction? You already know the moment  I\u2019m talking about. Were you just as shocked as we all were? Did Kirkman talk to you about this beforehand?",
            "Hi Ryan! Thanks so much for your contributions to the greatest comic book ever, a few questions for you:\n\nWith the renewed interest in invincible, do you see any possibilities of exploring more parts of the universe, maybe new ones? I always thought that mini series or small one shots of adventures involving anyone during some of the unseen off panel moments in invincible would be fun to explore, especially since it can be done without ruining that beautiful ending.\n\nAnd for the artist in me what are your secrets! Best tips for practice and learning how to draw like you (not that I\u2019d copy your style but I certainly would love to draw inspiration from it)",
            "1. What do you draw just for fun?\n2. What would be your dream team of collaborators to work with that you haven't worked with already (writer, colorist, letterer)?\n3. Which Invincible character would you have given a different ending? >! I personally adored Shapesmith despite his flaws and it was heartbreaking to see him go. I know his ending helped tell the story but it still hurt. !<\n\nAlso, this Reanimen commission you did is still my favorite comic possession. I loved the D.A. Sinclair and Reanimen subplot!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/40ec2m0enm3d1.jpeg?width=2698&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c83ef43df979f0943c25969e4fbef2a9f612584",

            "Hey Ryan, still a huge Allen fan here. How did you go about designing Allen\u2019s progression as he aged/evolved? I believe he\u2019s the only Unopan we ever see in old age.",
            "Hey Ryan! Do you prefer the yellow suit or the blue suit for Mark? Or maybe some of the other alternative versions of his suit? \n\nBtw live your work on the comic, the art is so good!",
            "Throughout the entire run, which character would you say was the most fun for you to design?",
            "What is your favourite music artist/band?",
            "Thanks for doing this AMA, like really.\n\nNow, my question is, out of all the characters you drew for invincible who would you consider the coolest/the one you liked to draw the most?",
            "Thank you for taking the time to do this!\n\nHow did it feel to draw the last issue that you were drawing for Invincible?",
            "Why do some Viltrumites have different uniforms? I realise some don\u2019t have the Viltrumite logo for example Kregg. But Conquest and Anissa do have the logo. Why is this? Personal preference? Or do they indicate rank somehow",
            "Why did you guys not give Best Tiger more time in the main comic? He's so cool, definitely my favorite comic book character, but I was sad to see him so little \ud83e\udd72",
            "What is your favorite issue of all time and why?",
            "What do you think of Hellboy or the Mignolaverse in general?",
            "Whats Marks and eves favorite fruit",
            "Hey Ryan, thanks for providing this AMA.\n\nMy question is what was your favourite gory moment to illustrate?",
            "Hey Ryan! Super happy you're doing this!\n\nI just wanna take a moment to thank you for all the art you've made for the Invincible comic book.\n\nAfter watching season 1, deciding to read the source material (the comics) and reading all 144 issues... i've became a huge fan of your art! It resonates me on another level, much more than the trendy Anime art style. Which inspired me to be an artist \\[and inspired to draw violence and gore \ud83d\ude2c\\]\n\nHere's a recent artwork of mine inspired by your pov stuff:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cizvzgra0m3d1.png?width=3210&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89fea548d73af304e6a2d7bc48b3612d6ae00e55\n\nAnyways enough flattery, may i ask, where do you get inspiration for making violence/gore when making Invincible? Is it some Intuitive?\n\nIf its from reference, do you look at real life references, or do you refer to certain media or things for inspiration?",
            "Simple question: which comic issue of Invincible was your favorite to draw and why?",
            "Any future plans for collabs with Erik Larsen? Some of my favorite pieces you\u2019ve done have been The Walking Dead #50 superhero variant cover and the Invincible Returns #1 variant cover, where you worked from Erik\u2019s layouts.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019d love to see some sequential pages where you work with Erik similarly to how you worked with Greg Capullo on Haunt.\n\nWho are some other artists that you\u2019d like to collaborate with in this way? I love seeing the mash-up of styles!",
            "Thank you for the AMA! If in a alternate universe Invincible was created in a different decade (same characters, stories), who would you have liked to see as the artists? 70s Invincible? 90s Invincible?\n\nAlso, if the Invincible Extended Comic Universe continued, what artists do you think would be cool to add to the stable?",
            "What\u2019s your favorite Invincible moment?",
            "Were there any surprisingly challenging scenes or moments to plan out and illustrate?",
            "Hey Ryan, ever since I was a little kid I have loved creating stories. As I have gotten older it has been my dream to be a comic book writer/creator. I am currently in Highschool and I want to know the best thing I can do to enter the comic book industry after Highschool? What is the best thing I can do to achieve my dream and become a comic book writer who can one day have my favorite story published at Image.",
            "Hello Mr Ottley, Ive always wondered this one question since Ive read issue #106. In your opinion who do you think is stronger: Omni man or Invincible? Who would've won that arm wrestle match?",
            "Will there be an 2nd invincible universe compendium?",
            "Any chance we get more of that Battle Beast spinoff?\n\nAlso, just gotta say, you are definitely one of my favorite comic artists of all time!!",
            "Wow this it\u2019s cool af that the actual artist is here on the subreddit!!",
            "What characters did you enjoy the process of designing the most?",
            "Hi Ryan, was just wondering when it comes to drawing the comic is pretty much everything that you draw written out by Kirkman? For example with the Conquest fight was the part where Mark destroyed Conquest\u2019s arm, and the head butting there? Did Kirkman give you space to add some stuff to it that you wanted?\n\nAlso I know that in the show you\u2019re supposed to be Filip Schaff, creator of S\u00e8ance Dog. So in the comic was that supposed to be Cory Walker?",
            "I know you didn\u2019t draw the final issues of Invincible, but why does emperor Mark look so old? Was that a mistake? Viltrumites age slowly and he somehow looks 50 whereas his daughter who\u2019s only 20 ish years younger than him (maybe 15 years younger if he didn\u2019t age during the 5 years he was gone) still looks really young. And 20 years is basically nothing in Viltrumite years.",
            "Absolutely love the show the POPs are amazing will we be getting more Funko versions of other characters?",
            "Does Mark ever form a good relationship with his son?",
            "Hi Ryan,\n\nLove your work! Any exciting upcoming projects?",
            "How did you get so good at drawing and what tips would you give to artists who want to improve their own art?",
            "Will you & Robert Kirkman ever plan to do an Agent spider comic or mini series? Or do anything else with him outside the Amazon show?",
            "will you have a hand in character design for the invincible video game? I know 2d and 3d character design and art is different, but it would feel wrong without the main artist for the source material not being included in the designs at least.",
            "Hey Ryan! First off, thanks for hosting this ama. \n\nMy question is pretty simple: were the meta jokes about comics being published on time a sort of self-deprecation about the Invincible schedule, or was there more to it than that?",
            "Hi Ryan! Who was your favorite character to draw throughout the series?",
            "Who do you consider to be the hottest character in invincible?",
            "Hi Ryan, your work on *Invincible* has been widely praised for its dynamic action scenes and expressive character designs. How do you approach creating such intense and emotionally resonant artwork, and what are some of the biggest challenges you\u2019ve faced in maintaining consistency and quality over the long run of the series?\n\nAlso, any chance you can visit Vancouver BC, Canada to meet your fans?",
            "I desperately just gotta know why Rudy/Rex became a ginger once he got back from the Flaxan dimension even though him and og Rex were brunettes beforehand",
            "I gotta ask when\u2019s the new season of seance dog coming out?",
            "Also do you have a favorite mark costume design or superhero costume design in the Invincible Universe?",
            "What is your favorite issue of invincible? Ily btw your art is amazing",
            "Hey Ryan, ima a huge fan of your work. What do you think the best issue of invincible is?",
            "How true to the comics do you think the Amazon Prime show will stay? Do you think we\u2019ll see any major changes to some characters fates?",
            "Hey Ryan, I love your art! It\u2019s such a detailed and aesthetically pleasing art style to me. But early on in the comics your art style was much different. It also feels like you really improved as an artist over those years. Did you ever do specific practice to get better, or did drawing for a monthly comic over the years naturally improve your artistic ability? \n\nAlso how did you learn how to draw gore so well?",
            "What was your first concert?",
            "Was there any scrapped plans or ideas you wanted to do In the invincible comics but didn\u2019t?",
            "what are mark and nolans fav kind of chips",
            "What are some changes/regrets you made in the comics you would like revamped/changed in the show? Or even positive things you would like to be elaborated on more in the show.",
            "Did being a comic artist for Invincible pay well? How much did you make? And how much do you make from working on the show?",
            "If you could take the place of one of the characters in the series, who would it be?",
            "Are we going to see some events that were only mentioned in the comics get animated?",
            "Also Ryan, I know that during the comic\u2019s run Cory was still helping with some designs. He designed Thragg I think you said. So did you just need help making him? Were there other characters he helped you design?\n\nAnd I think you said that Kirkman also designed some characters. I think you said he made all the Lizard League designs. Did he just have them ready for you? Were there other characters that he designed too?",
            "I might be dumb, but was there a different penciler/inker after the Viltrumite war? I feel like the art was waaaay more airbrushed than it used to be. \nThanks for all you do :)",
            "What was your favourite fight to draw? I loved the compilation panel ones personally!",
            "Is it just me or is Battle Beast stronger than Thragg, all things considered?",
            "why is your art so freaking good like holy shit man",
            "Was there ever any plans to do a Batman & Invincible Crossover Comic?",
            "Is there any part you least wanted to draw? You said to yourself \"this is stupid\" yet still did it?",

There\u2019s soo much content in this series\u2014it would take countless seasons to do it all justice.. has there been any discussion internally with Amazon of doing more one-offs, a la Atom Eve special? ..and If I send you a proper storyboard of a baddass Powerplex one-off, would you give it the chance it deserves? \n\nAnother quickie:  I don\u2019t expect you to announce your next independent project whimsically here on my thread.. but is there an eta on when an announcement may be coming?  \n\nYou\u2019re the goat.

He talked specifically about how when he was writing his script he always thought about how you would draw it out, and as someone who both writes and is currently getting into art, I found that really inspiring. I was wondering how you use your art to tell a story, how you give every panel and character so much life visually.

            "Yes! Great question! Remember, an artist has to choose the visuals, and with that, the acting, the lighting, etc. You basically get to act like a director and direct the scene to make it how you want. I recommend to artists to learn some cinematography, by reading about it and simply watching great cinema, and also watching how great artists do compositions for certain scenes. Jack Kirby, Greg Capullo, Erik Larsen, all are extremely good at dynamism and getting the point across in the panel. An artist needs to figure out the best composition for each scene. You have to know when an upshot or down shot, or a close up or a full wide shot with location details is appropriate for what the writer is trying to say. I\u2019d also recommend a book called Framed Ink. Really good composition tips. But basically you\u2019ll find a lot of great ideas within good movies and comics. Just need to be inspired by a lot of quality content to up your game.",
            "Spoilers! >!Nolan. It was so sad to visualize that scene. It\u2019s weird because I was with these characters everyday for decades, so in a weird way they feel like family. So even during the Angstrom scene in issue 33 when he broke Debbie\u2019s arm, it was infuriating to me, I\u2019m drawing this happen and I felt sad and upset which helps fuel the emotion in the art, in my opinion. But Marks parents felt real at those times and I hated putting them through so much pain. I know, it\u2019s silly, it\u2019s lines on paper. But to create those lines I have to go through the emotion of it all and put my anger and sadness on paper in hopes that the readers feel what me and Robert want you to feel. !<",
            "Favorites questions are hard! So I\u2019ll say a few. All time fave: Battle Angel Alita, Akira. Current: Saga. Current Transformers!",
            "That is a difficult question. I\u2019m terrible at choosing favorites of anything. I see problems here and there with things I draw, it\u2019s how I\u2019ve trained myself to become better, so it\u2019s hard to pick a favorite of my own art. Let\u2019s change the question to favorite arcs to create the visuals for. I\u2019d have to say Conquest arc, Viltrumite war arc, and what I\u2019m working on right now are my faves!",
            "Hmmm, difficult to me has always had to do with time. Not actual difficulty in drawing. Because this is a deadline based series, I had to rush everyday to get enough done to meet the deadline, so when a page came along that required lots of figures, it really made things more difficult. So the biggest most difficult pages were in the Viltrumite war with the exploding of Vilturm double page splashes. And then the page of Thragg with his thousands of children. That one took over a week. Which definitely slowed me down. But in the end it was absolutely necessary to get the shock I wanted across.",
            "I\u2019d have to say characters I co- created. The act of creation can be very difficult but so enjoyable once you get the visual down where both of us like the outcome. Battle Beast, Conquest, Dinosaurus, Anissa, Powerplex, Shapesmith, to name a few.",
            "If it was now, I\u2019d simply draw the way I draw. Back then I was hungry and accepted the suggestions to keep my style minimal etc. I\u2019m much more set in my ways now. Back then I did less detail to keep the vibe Cory set. But no one can draw like Cory, he\u2019s skill is intensely strong and style all his own. So I basically did my best to draw like me but with less of the detail I was known for at the time. Then my goal was to grow as an artist and only compare myself to myself.",
            "Oh, definitely Superman. And it would be a gore fest like you wouldn\u2019t believe. Viltrumites would get Batman and Lobo on their side and they\u2019d construct a plan to take down Clark and his entire Kryptonian race. Clark would hire Lex Luther out of desperation to help him survive. Let the bloodbath happen DC, don\u2019t be afraid.",
            "I start doing. I am a firm believer in motivation and creativity always happening in the act of doing, rarely before. Once you get discipline down, you forget to care about how you feel. I could feel completely unmotivated one morning but since I have things planned to get done, I simply start doing and then after some time my motivation kicks in, creativity follows, and I\u2019m in my zone! Music and podcasts, or tv shows that aren\u2019t too visual can help keep me at the table!",
            "Thragg and Battle Beast was beyond fun. I loved Robert\u2019s idea of showing the fight scene every once in a while which implied a months long fight. And the ending was tragic but so impactful.",
            "It\u2019s still beyond surreal. I\u2019ve gone to conventions every year as the Invincible artist for the past twenty years and every time there would be con-goers that would ask what this unknown independent superhero comic is about. Now no one asks! There\u2019s a whole new age group wildly into it and it still blows my mind. I\u2019m not used to it, and probably won\u2019t ever be used to it, but I am enjoying the ride!",
            "Ya know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen more cosplay since the show came out, it\u2019s about the same. Comic fans loved to cosplay as well. One New York comic Con I went to, had more Invincible cosplay than I\u2019ve ever seen and this was years before there was a show. And I\u2019ve never seen those characters portrayed since. Like Battle beast and Anissa, really cool to see those recreated. These days it\u2019s mostly Nolan, Mark, and Eve. But shortly I bet many other characters will be attending cons. I\u2019ll keep posting them on my Instagram! Always fun to see them!",
            "Why is ur forehead so big  \ncan i build my airport on it?",
            "Conquest arc will always have a warm place in my heart. But I am proud of so many arcs Robert and I created together. I love the flaxan scenes that was portrayed in season 2. Dinosaurus arc was insanely fun. Even as far back as the initial fight with Nolan and Mark, I\u2019m proud of it even though I kinda wish I could draw it all over again. Old art is hard to look back on with admiration.",
            "Well, it was when Invincible was wrapping up. And Marvel heard about us ending our book, so they reached out and asked. And my initial thought was \u201cOh, well that would be a good next book!\u201d Spiderman is what got me into comics so naturally I always had the desire to draw him someday. Excited! That\u2019s how I felt. In the end I prefer creator owned comics, but it was a fun gig for the time.",
            "Not even Kirkman would answer this lol",
            "Yes, while laying out a scene I like to add little things that amuse me since I\u2019m the one spending so much time drawing the scene, the more ways I can entertain myself while doing it, the better!\n\nThere\u2019s probably so many things I\u2019ve forgotten, I\u2019d have to go through it all to remember them all. I\u2019ve drawn friends in there, comic characters and movie actors, I even put in a lot of religious things because I used to be very religious at the time. I should compile all the Easter eggs. Too many to count!",
            "A lot of people do look at Invincible as one project, but for me it was my full time job for most of my career, so each arc felt like a new project. Credit to Robert for keeping the scripts so interesting and fun for me month in and month out. So there are arcs I\u2019m more proud of than others, so many things hold a special place in my heart, and it\u2019s usually the scenes that are ripping hearts out which is the best definition of irony.",
            "Quit! But only for a little while! Then get back to it. Doesn\u2019t work? Quit again! But only for a little while. Go for a walk, destress. But a lot of the feeling of art block doesn\u2019t go away until you start. So be sure to get back to drawing and a lot of the time creativity and inspiration come back while you are in the act of doing. Rarely before.",
            "Thanks for coming by my booth at LA comic con! Always a great convention! It\u2019s definitely amusing seeing the memes for sure. I\u2019d say the surreal feeling comes from seeing our property expand so much, I never thought it\u2019d become something that would be so pop culture popular. I doubt I\u2019ll ever get used to it! But I love it all!",
            "Man this was such a good one, shame it wasn't answered",
            "Allen\u2019s initial design was by Cory Walker. Amazing design, I love the guy. Robert basically wanted changes throughout the series, especially after Allen got his ass beat. I drew him bigger and buffer after that first fight in issue 23. But then I had to do a couple redesigns throughout the series when he became leader, and Cory did a couple redesigns too. That last redesign took a couple tries since Robert wanted me to draw him with some kind of super strong rock type structure like the Thing. I\u2019d love to see how he\u2019d continue to evolve after a few more beatings. I should do some sketches for fun.",
            "Again, I\u2019m terrible at choosing favorites. I absolutely love classical music, I do love heavy metal like High on Fire, Electric Wizard, and I love rap like Jedi Mind Tricks, Wu Tang, MF DOOM. I have too many favorites that change day to day.",

            "Like what? Thragg has dozens of Viltrumites on earth. If Mark and Nolan try to fight him then and there, they'd lose.... badly. And then the kid gloves would come off and earth would become Thragg's breeding camp.\u00a0\n\n\nInstead Nolan and Mark decided to take the truce. Mark because he didn't want to risk the lives of innocent humans trying to fight off 30+ Viltrumites, and Nolan because he suspected that Viltrumites who lived long enough among humans would come to see us the way he does.\u00a0\n\n\nThey had to agree to a truce sure, but I think Nolan was the real winner here since he was right.\u00a0",

As we learned they all became big softies. \n\nI think the real error was how Nolan dealt with Thragg when the Viltrumites turned on him and made Nolan their leader. \n\nThey should have forced Thragg to also go to earth and start a family, and I wager he would have also turned into a more empathetic person. That or kill him. Exiling him was a bad idea.",
            "From Earth's side? Not really.\n\nI mean, what choices do they have? The Viltrumites are clearly monitoring the planet and things coming to it from orbit. If they act against the Viltrumites, the Viltrumites will know, and they will retaliate. There is no force on Earth that can stop them if they decided to attack. They could kill everyone if they wanted to.\n\nYou can't even subtly do it - like  if they had Nolan and Mark going around killing Viltrumites 1 at a time, like only once a week or month - they'd still see that as an attack, because a Viltrumite can't get murdered in the street by some crackhead, so they'd know you were up to something.",

That's the real problem, even having a way to beat them one at a time doesn't help, because killing a Viltrumite is NOT an easy thing and the vast majority of things on earth simply can't do it.

            "Nolan telling Mark that he always loved him when he thinks that they\u2019re about to die hits pretty hard as well. The Viltrumite war is going to be amazing when we get it in 50 years.",
            "Thragg is one of my favorite OP characters in fiction. He's so scary. He's the strongest force in this universe, but he'll also negotiate with you if it's convenient for him. But those negotiations have this looming feeling of threat to them, since he has resting mad dog face and very well might get annoyed and kill you.\n\n\nThe scariest moments are when he controls himself, like when he resisted the urge to pop Ursaal's head. He's clearly has an emormous rage problem, but he also has such will that he can actually stifle it completely, and does so almost all the time. It's like sharing a room with a T-Rex that's visibly shaking from how badly it wants to bite you.",
            "Right before {spoiler} {spoiler} Nolan",
            "\"we can't\"\n\nnolan's certainty in his words and the defeated look on his face, as if him and mark were already dead, is perfection to me. even thragg's expression shows a lot. one of my favorite moments in the series.",
            "Yeah, Thragg IIRC via Kirkman was said to be the strongest character in the verse Pre time skip and it\u2019s relatively obvious off statements and feats alone.\n\n-He effortlessly stomped the shit outta both Mark and Nolan 2v1.\u00a0\n\n-Killed Nolan in their 3rd fight.\n\n-Utterly left Conquest and (after several Zenkai boosts) Allen in fear of engaging him in combat, as well as shredded Thadeus who was matching Kregg and Anissa punch for punch.\u00a0\n\n-Killed multiple Ragnars with his bare hands (who\u2019re the only race powerful enough to kill a some of the strongest Viltrumite like Anissa and brutally injured Conquest).\n\n-And fought The Scourge of the Twin Galaxies in Battle Beast for weeks on end without tiring and was the only opponent Thokk deemed as\n\u201ca worthy adversary\u201d.\n\nThe only showing close to an anti-feat for Thragg\u00a0was when he got beat down by 6 viltrumites and lost to Mark in the \u201cEnd of all Things\u201d when they were in the Sun.\n\nBut it\u2019s easy to say that Viltrumites only did that because they had the \u201cnumbers\u201d advantage not because they were \u201cstronger\u201d, because individually they\u2019d get their asses beat by Thragg otherwise without massive help.\u00a0\n\nAnd Mark (even after Eve making him a little stronger after reviving him from death) didn\u2019t really overpower Thragg, and needed help from Robot to put him down.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo in conclusion, if the show so far is good at \u00a0showcasing how strong Nolan is so far, they\u2019ll do justice to Thragg.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",
            "This was honestly one of the most intense fights I\u2019ve ever seen in a comic book. I think I\u2019m the only one excited for the Viltrumite War more than the Invincible War. \ud83e\udd72",
            "Freddie Mercury truly is op",
            "and then battle beast fights the same mf for days with a cut stomach",
            "Hey, what about using the power of friendship?  Would that work?",
            "I can\u2019t get over how Thragg was \u201ceducated in all manner of combat\u201d and then it turns out he just has like a 50% strength buff compared to everyone else",
            "Nolan\u2019s Thragg skin in MK1 made me very excited",
            "I can\u2019t wait to hear who will voice him\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ym2iwyntf08d1.jpeg?width=295&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05c3de74778ce8cfc2831397abf901c0b9deae2b",
            "This Thragg dude seems pretty OP.",
            "I hope they don\u2019t tone him down like they did with Nolan. I don\u2019t really understand why they made the guardians of the globe do so much more damage to Nolan in the show.",
            "I thought u we\u2019re stronger was kinda a let down so \n\nFingers crossed \ud83d\udc31",
            "In the show they\u2019re going to blast some cringey sad song over this scene just like how they did in S2 with Mark\u2019s mental breakdown and Omni Man\u2019s blackhole scene\u2026 and the scene where Allen got his ass beat.\n\nGod the music choices in this show are butt. And not only that, sad music isn\u2019t always needed. That omni man scene wouldve been much more impactful if it was just ambient sounds of space.",
            "Viltrumites will have invaded us by that time..\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7k5kciuwzx7d1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53b52d398ada57b1b9947ae6f476f44aacab7ede",
            "Realistically what season would this happen in? 5 or 6?",
            "that sounds like way too few time",
            "Like Homelander if he was actually competent, which is somehow scarier.",
            "Kinda like Homelander, but with the opposite temperament.",

            "> Yeah, Thragg IIRC via Kirkman was said to be the strongest character in the verse Pre time skip and it\u2019s relatively obvious off statements and feats alone.\n\nWait a sec... does that mean the ENTIRE image-verse? Including stuff like Spawn, Savage Dragon, Supreme, etc.",
            "Now I don't doubt that Ragnarrs couldn't injure or kill Conquest, but he was still experiencing the aftereffects of the scourge virus when he was sent to Savage Planet to take care of the job that Nolan failed to do. Pretty sure the only Viltrumites that could take on and out Ragnarrs toe to toe are Thragg, Conquest, and Nolan. Also, that scene where Thragg literally oneshots a bunch of Ragnarrs was years after the Viltrumite War where he drastically gained stregth.",
            "Invincible War is a small taste of what the Viltrumite will LOOK like",

            "*insert Conquest \"ARE YOU CRAZY?!?\"*",
            "I feel like his strength cannot be measured or compared against someone like Nolan or any viltrumite. Thragg might be off the charts with how easily he pummels Mark and Nolan in space",

            "That was likely done for dramatic effects. We already saw how Nolan no-diffed the Immortal in an alternate universe and I just can't visualize how he'd struggle with the rest of the OG Guardians.",
            "With knowledge of the attack a few minutes beforehand thru mark the guardians managed to defeat Nolan p handily in the comics so I don\u2019t think he was THAT toned down.",
            "\u201cAmbient sounds of space\u201d lol",
            "What are you smoking lol. The song choices last season were great.",
            "Well, it's a good thing everyone agrees that your opinion is trash",
            "1)Educate yourself on how animated shows work.\n\n2)I have a playlist, 44 of the songs are purely from the Invincible series. For context, there are only around 54 songs that have ever been used in the animated series.\n\n3)Never let yourself cook",

            "I think 5 would be appropriate just because it should be around 10 seasons if they\u2019re trynna explain the end arc when mark is the big man",
            "Honestly I could see it sometime in season 4\u2026 maybe the END of season 4, but sometime",
            "Ooooouu I loved that part",
            "I guess only invincible universe",
            "Yes, when they crossover. The higher archery puts them lower than thragg. \n\nThis might not apply to the gods, and different spawn forms.",
