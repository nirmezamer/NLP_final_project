        "content": "Disclaimer: My goal with this thread is not to belittle or take a side on today's issues. The goal is to showcase a specific celebration as well as Christianity's role in it. These kinds of things are difficult to stay completely neutral on while still making a point relevant to the topic at hand, but I have attempted to do so.\n\nYou are more than welcome to use this thread as a jumping off point for discussion. You are also welcome to use this thread as a simple means of learning some history.\n\nThis month's banner represents Juneteenth. Although the Emancipation Proclamation was issued in the US in 1863, the 13th Amendment was not ratified until December 6th, 1865. Even then, the last slaves were not told they were free until June 19th, 1865. Juneteenth has evolved to become more than just a day of remembering a scar that plagued the United States, but it has become a month to reflect on what it means to be \"free\".\n\nChristianity played a very unique role in the days of slavery as well as the push leading to end it. One of the first names given to June 19th was Jubilee Day. This was in reference to Leviticus 25:8-54. What is described was a festival dedicated to the Lord. The Israelites were to forgive debts, release others from bondage, and even restore some tribal lands. The freed slaves saw this as a perfect representation to their newfound freedoms.\n\nDuring the time of slavery, many slaves throughout the Caribbean islands of Jamaica, Barbados, and Antigua were given a \"Slave Bible\" as to not give them anything that might lead to rebellion. This version of the Bible left out most of the Old Testament. What was left were passages aimed at telling slaves to be subservient. This says something about the strength Christianity holds on those who read Scripture. Slaveholders did not want slaves to muster enough spiritual or mental strength to recognize the strength they had to escape their captivity.\n\nEven then, [The Haitian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Revolution) happened.\n\nThis obfuscation of the Bible is one of the several aspects of slavery that Christianity has had to wrestle with since the Emancipation Proclamation was signed.\n\nWhile it is clear the main push to continue slavery was for economic gain, a main source used to justify this push was God's word, at least what was presented as His word. This greed was not found only within the political institutions that ran the governments attempting to call for the continuation of slavery. This greed made its way into the hearts of some churches as well.\n\nIn 1838, Theodore Clapp, Unitarian minister of the Independent Unitarian Society, New Orleans wrote:\n\n>I would say to every slave in the United States, 'You should realize that a wise, kind, and merciful Providence has appointed for you your condition in life; and, all things considered, you could not be more eligibly situated. The burden of your care, toils and responsibilities is much lighter than that, which God has imposed on your Master. The most enlightened philanthropists, with unlimited resources, could not place you in a situation more favorable to your present and everlasting welfare than that which you now occupy...\n\nAt the same time, Scripture was a driving force in the Abolitionist Movement.\n\nTheodore Weld was one of the leading figures in the push to end slavery. Unlike his counterparts who were using God's word to push for the continuation of slavery, he saw God's word as overwhelming in favor of a freed people:\n\n>No condition of birth, no shade of color, no mere misfortune of circumstances, can annul that birth-right charter, which God has bequeathed to every being upon whom he has stamped his own image, by making him a free moral agent,\" Weld stated. \"He who robs his fellow man of this tramples upon right, subverts justice, outrages humanity, unsettles the foundations of human safety, and sacrilegiously assumes the prerogative of God.\n\nSince the Emancipation Proclamation, Christianity has had to come to terms with the role it played in slavery. As we see in this subreddit, the \"clarity\" surrounding God's word and slavery is still debated.\n\nI hope this look at Christianity's role in all aspects of slavery brings to light the importance of Juneteenth, and why I chose it to be represented this month. Yes, on the surface, Juneteenth is a day to celebrate the freeing of the last slave in the United States, but it has become much more than that. It is a time to reflect on the values we hold as human beings and to question where we are moving. It is also a time to reflect on the word of God and to take a hard look at those who use it as a means to an end.\n\nJuneteenth is a stark reminder that even the holiest of things can be used as a tool for subjugation. It is also a reminder that, in the right hands, the Word can be used to bring good back to the world.",

            "I need to say something here, playing a large role in something doesn't mean you were on the right side.  Any role that Christianity had in slavery and ending slavery was at best self serving at at worst only made things more difficult for Blacks to be accepted as equals in society.  Self serving evangelization i.e. presenting people with converting to your faith as a means to \"save them\" so you can feel good about yourself...this only furthered the idea that the Blacks were lesser because they largely followed African or Afro-Caribbean folk religions or traditional beliefs...this was the same treatment the native americans got and the answer from Christians was to \"save them\" by doing nothing about helping them save their land, but, taking every effort to convert them not only to Christianity but to a European way of life.  Juneteenth is not a Christian holiday by any means, but, is a day to remember that a group of  slaves in Texas were never freed despite the federal laws in place outlawing the practice and the owners...Christians.  Juneteenth should be to remember a horrible historic event and celebrate the freedom and equality we now have in our country and not an excuse for Evangelical Christians to pat themselves on the back.

Pope Gregory XVI also issued a Papal Bull In supremo apostolatus in 1839 that states...\n\n> \"We, by apostolic authority, warn and strongly exhort... that no one in the future dare to bother unjustly, despoil of their possessions, or reduce to slavery Indians, Blacks or other such peoples... We prohibit and strictly forbid any Ecclesiastic or lay person from presuming to defend as permissible this trade in Blacks under no matter what pretext or excuse, or from publishing or teaching in any manner whatsoever, in public or privately, opinions contrary to what We have set forth in these Apostolic Letters\"\n\n\n\nChristianity is all across the abolition of slavery, and continues to be as we work to abolish it totally.",

(Slavery is wage theft.)\n\n- Treat others the way you would have them treat you. (Do you want to be treated like a slave?)\n\n- Greed - the love of money - is the root of all kinds of evil.

There were no statues erected in 1866, no high schools were named after generals, the confederate flag (or what everyone thinks is the confederate flag, but the battle flag of northern VA) disappeared from pop culture all the way until the 1940s when the flag became the banner of the KKK and the united daughters of the confederacy began collecting money to build confederate statues and monuments, buy naming rights of schools and so forth all to intimidate black students from enrolling in white schools when they began integrating public school and bussing programs...I really think if more people really understood the full history behind all that, they wouldn't defend it like its actual historically relevant.",

Listed right there at the top of page one. \n\nThis stuff is literally relevant to my job, I know how to read an autopsy report.The idea of lethal limits of any drug is context dependent. So for starters it depends on the individual. Lethal levels in a 5'3\" 110 pound woman who has never done fentanyl vary quite deeply from a 250 pound man with history of use. And beyond that, there are a variety of ways in which an overdose kills you. A common one you might be familiar with how people choke on their own vomit for example - so the way people die from overdose is context dependent. \n\nAnd beyond that, you have to get deeper into the labs. For example, you have to compare the levels of fentanyl in the blood vs. the levels of metabolized fentanyl (which shows how the body has already processed). [The expert toxicologist from the trial](https://youtu.be/IEwbQMLQ5x8?si=JBWzuM9F1mEiK_bR) explained it well, that when you actually dig into the vital ratios, Floyd's toxicology report shows levels lower than the average in DUI cases and well below the ratio average found in fatal cases.\n\nAs the examiner testified in the trial, the drug use and heart disease were *factors* in his death, they may have made it less likely he survived. Same as if someone with a coagulation disorder were shot, they're more likely to die based on their medical history, but it doesn't change the cause of death. \n\n>there were no life threatening injuries as well, as in no damage to his throat\n\nThat's normal in asphyxiation. He didn't die from physical trauma but the obstruction to his breathing that came from the subdual. \n\n\n>And also honey, if they were so non violent, why did they kill 23 people and cause billions in damages, unlike the 60s actual protests\n\nWell shmookims - I'm afraid the protests in the 60s were not so innocent as you may have imagined! The Detroit riot of 1967 - More people died in that one city alone in the riots of that year than the nationwide death toll from 2020. I can point to several examples of deadly riots from the 60s.",

I\u2019ve watched all but her last video.\n\nIt\u2019s now been 25 years since the Matrix. I\u2019ve bought the iTunes movie with special features. I\u2019ve watched the movie once, next up will probably be the philosophers commentary on the movie. But I\u2019m surprised by how well the movie has held up.\n\nOther 25th anniversary movies I want to watch: The Insider, Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut, Go, The Winslow Boy, Existenz (never seen), and Titus. I saw a lot of these movies in the theater, now I get to see them from my home theater.",

Our answer is that they have different purposes, Jesus (the Word) if the perfect image of God and is the Fathers way of reaching us; the Father also creates using his living Word. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit that guides us, and it is the Spirit that makes you know right from wrong, to do miracles, etc\u2026 and they are inseparable and each one works in unison with the 2 other manifestations all being begotten and proceeded by the Father (Nicene creed 325)\n\nWhat is your answer to that?",

Sex with your spouse will help their needs and keep them from going astray. If you are receiving plenty of pleasure from your spouse, would you seek it elsewhere? And vice versa, if you pleasure your spouse frequently, wouldn't you expect them to not wander off? Don't get me wrong, there is absolutely no excuse for adultery, however, 1 Corinthians 7 tells us to come together often so that Satan will not tempt you!

Would *they* have understood it as allegory to the relationship between Jesus/God and the church/Israel? Would *they* have understood allegory at all? \n\nThey certainly wouldn't have understood it as allegory to the relationship between Jesus and the church, because, if it was written by Solomon, it was written in approximately the 10th century BCE (more likely 3rd century BCE), well before Christ in either case. Thus, *we* shouldn't understand it that way because that can't be how the author intended it, because he intended it to be understood by a contemporary audience.\n\nSong of Songs 8:4 *Promise me, O women of Jerusalem,*\n\n*not to awaken love until the time is right*.\n\nSong of Songs 8:8-9\n\n8 *We have a little sister too young to have breasts.*\n\n*What will we do for our sister if someone asks to marry her?*\n\n9 *If she is a virgin, like a wall, we will protect her with a silver tower.*\n\n*But if she is promiscuous, like a swinging door, we will block her door with a cedar bar*.\n\nI think the meaning is quite plain.",

Were the Corinthians asking \"*is* it good for a man to abstain from sex?\" Or perhaps they had not asked, and instead declared \"it *is* good for a man to abstain from sex with women.\"\n\nPaul's response indicates that he's still more worried about all the reports he's getting about Corinthians celebrating incest and *malakos* and *arsenokoites* (the highly contentious words often translated to mean homosexuals.)  because he starts in with \"since sexual immorality *is* occurring...\" which conditions his advice in terms of the Corinthian situation.\n\nPaul's pretty straight with his assessment of why he thinks this is good advice for the Corinthians in vs 5- \"you guys have *no* self control!\" There's a larger theme here about Paul's pseudo-stoic ideas about sex and passion, but that's a digression. vs 6 should be a big signal that this advice is for non-ideal situations. \"I'm not trying to talk *down* to you, I want everything good for you that I have for myself- but consider maybe you didn't receive gifting of self-control like I did.\"\n\nThis read is backed up in 8 - 9: \"If you have passions threatening to overtake you, get married! Otherwise, don't change your situation, because maybe you're actually more like me. Just don't make yourself miserable because you want to imitate me.\"\n\ndoes that analysis help clear things up at all?",
