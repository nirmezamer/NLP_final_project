        "content": "This post is for feedback regarding matchmaking in all modes. \n\nPost thoughts, criticism and suggestions you have on matchmaking.\n\nTo make this constructive and not just be \"matchmaking bad\"  (which everyone \"agrees\" on but everyone else means a different thing by) or \"why am I facing three stack preds?\", make sure you explain in as much detail as possible what you mean. Here's some questions that help with that, so go over them and see if you can add information to your comment:\n\n- What mode are you talking about?\n\n- What do you consider good/bad/fair matchmaking [in that mode]? What do you think is healthiest, individually and/or for the player base as a whole (across skill levels)?\n\n- What kind of matchmaking do you want for ranked/pubs/mixtape/solos? [possibly: completely random matchmaking; loose skill based matchmaking/tight skill based matchmaking; loose rank based matchmaking in ranked/tight rank based matchmaking; something else]\n\n- What kind of matchmaking are you experiencing (vs what you want from that mode)? In what ways is it a problem?\n\n- How do you assess the strength of your lobby / strength of players you are facing? Badges (which ones) / trackers / current rank / ...?\n\n- What is your current rank?\n\n- What is your skill level (highest previously achieved ranks)?\n\n- How should matchmaking deal with parties of varied skill (or rank) / how does it deal with it / how good/bad is the experience (and again it's important to distinguish whether you're talking about ranked or pubs here)?\n\n- With regards to smurfing: How much of a problem is / how does it affect your experience / how easy is it to do/how common is it / What to do against it?\n\n- Thoughts on ranked resets (their effect on matchmaking)\n\n- What is your experience of matchmaking in high ranks / matchmaking in low ranks? How does it match with what you expect from ranked?\n\n- The above mostly focuses on \"skill\", but since it's come up recently from time to time (with XDefiant as well), what are your views on input based matchmaking (including potentially negative effects it might have on all of the above). Remember to please keep it civil as this is a topic that constantly leads to toxicity and incivility / personal attacks, rather than level-headed discussion of arguments.\n\n- Related to the previous point, what about cross play between PC / console?\n\n- [I might add more points here if anything comes to mind.]\n\nYou can also post proof of the situations you're encountering (links to screenshots / clips, you can upload them on imgur or similar).\n\n---\n\nFor reference, here's some old articles posted by respawn on the principles of matchmaking in the game\n\nJan 2023 https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/matchmaking-2023\n\nsome of the ranked dev blogs on the old systems and current system which also contain some information on ranked matchmaking\n\nS13 https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/saviors-ranked-update\n\nS17 https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/arsenal-ranked-2023-update\n\nS18 https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/july-2023-ranked-dev-blog\n\nS19 https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/17a41s1/dev_team_update_ranked_october_2023/\n\nS20 https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/breakout-patch-notes and https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1ajjwff/apex_legends_season_20_breakout_early_information/\n\n---\n\nAt least for the time this thread stays stickied (~ this week), discussion of these topics should be concentrated here rather than individual posts (as per our rules).",

            "Ranked matchmaking. Please, can we for once not have to fight preds until we're masters. There's preds in plat lobbies, such a huge gap in skill, and -60 is too much to lose dying to preds. Ideally plat vs plat, diamond vs diamond, masters/pred fight each other. Fight people who are currently the same rank as you are, and when u solo queue in, your teammates should also be the same rank as you are. No more gold 1, plat 4 and silver 2 in one team (not premade), please. I am willing to wait a few mins to avoid being paired with people outside of my rank, instead of giving me -60 getting 3 seconds queue time so that i can lose my RP faster.\n\nHonestly, this is my hot take and I know I am gonna get downvoted, I could not give a damn if they make ranked easier. If they make Diamond a free rank, I would be fine with it at this point, just so that there's plenty of players in the pool in plat and I don't have to fight preds in ranked (until Diamond at least). Reason being I feel like some servers are way too underpopulated, and the reason why this happens is probably not enough players in the high ranks. Heck back in S16 there was nobody to queue with in Diamond+ so everytime it queues us in, it merges with other servers causing 300+ ping for some people (this caused one of my friends to quit as he couldn't get masters/pred without playing with high ping due to his location)\n\nAlso you know how underpopulated a server is when you ask in discord for someone to play with and sometimes it takes up to 2 hours to even get anyone. Sometimes I couldn't get anyone even after 2 hours and I give up and close discord, and close Apex if I am just losing RP in a row",
            "input based matchmaking is literally the one and only thing i want for this game right now, at the very least in ranked mode which is supposed to be competitive.",
            "It feels like they did the same thing to matchmaking, which made a lot of people quit the game at season 18-19. Every enemy in lobby was back then, and at the beginning of this season - is an ALGS multiple predator XTTV Aceu level opponent. I die to either one clip, 2 pump, or, the cherry on top this season - 3 tap by wingman. By almost every enemy. Before i would consider a good game with 5-9 killz, and with randoms i was able to get at least 1 win per 2 hours. This season getting even one kill is a miracle, and ive gotten one trios win in 5 HOURS! Because of that, i decided to stop playing again. No point of \"playing\" when all you are doing is dying to impossible enemies. Because of how competitive they are, everyone is playing super safe, hiding, camping, not pushing. Fights turn into ALGS stalmates untill one side run out of med through constant poking. Often intead of fighting, we decide to rotate to zone safely. IN PUBS!!! Because as soon as you approach any fight - you instantly die. And i havent even tried solos, because have seen multiple clips of enemies there being even more horrendous, and even teaming. Respawn should revert their SBMM changes and make lobbies actually playable again. Untill then, theres no point in suffering.",
            "I would very much like to have input based matchmaking for at least a few weeks to see how the queue times and games go. Could finally implement input lock as well while we\u2019re at it",
            "If the scoring system filtered really good players out of plat then that may help with matchmaking.\n\n\n2 seasons in a row where most of the playerbase gets caught up in plat.\n\n\nGold is way too easy, plat takes too long. You end up with different skill sets all in the same rank.\n\n\nHow on earth respawn didnt adjust the scoring after last season is beyond me.",
            "Mixtape matchmaking is so insanely strict, it's genuinely unreal how every lobby I play is just controller stackers... I guess this is my reward for being decent at the game. Surely IBMM is feasible in mixtape atleast, as you only need 12/18 players.",
            "Gripe 400: blocked a guys EA account one game because he was a terrible teammate\u2026 get him as a teammate the next game lolll. Are these things on my screenshot just colors for show? Or do the words actually mean something?",
            "I was thinking of posting an alternative ranking system as an idea struck me yesterday. The main problem with Ranked is rank does not represent ability. You can get people at almost any level who can't play the game. You have teammates who run and rat and leave you a two man squad. It was extremely frustrating the other day where me and a capable random second were paired with a clear novice (in terms of ability) twice in a row. In one match, we landed sensibly with one other team, he and I took down two of them and messed the third up, and our unscathed third was slowly looting instead of running in to finish them. They reset and crushed him. \n\nA different approach is needed to awarding points so that people who can't play don't score many points and don't progress to higher ranks, and the way to rank up is to get good. Those who struggle with loot choices and combat will find challenging and rewarding matches fighting against like able players, while those of us who can play but aren't god tier get teams that play together, and those who can play god tier aren't left feasting on lower abilities. There's Trios for that wider level of competition.",
            "Matching people with a similar playstyle into squads would be great too.\n\nFor example let frequent quitters play in a team with other quitters, while people who rarely leave get teammates who also stay in the match even when downed and killed.\n\nPeople who now complain about quitting teammates would be happy, and the quitters wouldn't care and probably like it too when they get teammates who just like fast fights.",
            "Currently the biggest issue is that massive bottleneck in plat 4. Soloing out of there is a pure hell. You will get all kind of players because of how easy it is to get plat, but there is that -60 showstopper. And your randoms will just hot drop you with 5 other teams, becasue they have completely given up on the climb and are just bouncing between gold 1 and plat 4 the entire season. I got to plat 2 today and the games have been unironically easier, because all of a sudden I am matched with good players that use mics and play for rp. Sure, some cheaters and some cracked premades, but having actual teammates that don't troll drop, use good guns and talk is a huge difference.",
            "1.PUBS/Casual Playlist should either NEVER have SBMM or it should be as loose as possible. Example, Making anyone with a .7kd and below be in their own lobbies \n2. My lobbies are so tight I'm playing the same 300 players over and over and over week after week. 20 bomb 4k Triple Pred badge with 200k combined kills.\n3. I have a 2.8 lifetime kd. I've reached masters and consistently solo to Diamond.\n4. No one is complaining about matchmaking in ranked. We are just tired of playing ranked dying to cheaters and then being forced to play ranked 2.0 in pubs against the sweatiest 3 stacks on the planet.\n5. Smurfing is only an issue because a majority of people can't play with their friends because of matchmaking\n6. Input MM would be fine. Might even bring back a player base of MnK that left because controller dominates the game.\n7. 3 stacking and solo Q experience wouldn't be nearly an issue if matchmaking wasn't so brutal. There is a reason why no one really ever complained the first 3 years of this game about 3 stacks, because matchmaking didn't feel like an ALGS tryout. Same goes for Solo Q. There should be no reason I'm getting non prestige level 200 players in Plat+ when I have 5000hrs of game time.\n8.",
            "Add the option to enable/disable Crossplay and enable/disable Input-Based Matchmaking.",
            "Something I don\u2019t fully think is a good idea is they way that if there arn\u2019t enough players on the server for preds and masters to play each other they will pull people into my ranked game who are preds etc,\n\nIf my team are golds and i\u2019ve made it to plat IV on my way to diamond and the champion teams are 3 stack preds once a week because the server wants to give them games I shouldn\u2019t still loose 60rp,\n\nIf they give you top preds and your Plat or gold why not just have the system realise and much like loss forgiveness reduce rp loss significantly - as its not going to be a fair reflection of your rank if you loose to them, im aware if you beat them you might get a little extra rp or something but im more speaking to the integrity of the ranked system and what it means\n\nA fighting game like Tekken have a ranked system with 30 tiers and it will only match you with 2 or 3 ranks above or below you, you lose much less points if you are matched with someone 3 ranks above you but also if you are on tier 25 you will never be matched with a Tier 30 because the most important thing is the integrity that your rank is accurately reflected, however since so many people are needed in apex I think at least implementing less rp for losses if you do have to fight people way above your rank",
            "Apex is just awful again today. Non stop top 100 preds in any lobby I go into, completely brain dead gameplay in ranked by gold teammates while I'm struggling to hit plat II because of it, even the mixtape lobbies are infested with PC preds (I'm on console. Who at respawn ever thought it was a good idea to mix those lobbies?).\n\nGive us our own lobbies for all game modes. Don't make me have to turn off all crossplay to not get fucking beamed by impossible movement Octanes and Horizons.",
            "[removed]",
            "Matchmaking is a pile of garbage. It throws you into the hardest lobbies and then it seems to adjust your next 20 games based on how bad you get shit on each game. Eventually you end up in a bot lobby and win the match. Then its back to awful lobbies again. It's 100% retention based matchmaking and its complete shit. You play to get better but the more you play the more you get put in unfair lobbies. You are literally punished for queuing up again.",
            "Just commenting to put more support towards **input-based matchmaking**. Growing very tired of losing gun fights to players crutching on aim assist and not missing a bullet tracking. With 10+ hours in R5 Reloaded 1v1s my K/D against controller players is a 0.43 and my K/D against MnK players is a 0.93. The imbalance is just absurd to be considered competitive. Also before anyone comments saying I have a bad K/D, R5 is against damn good players. I am positive in the actual game.\n\nAs for general matchmaking I don't have much of a concern. Sure I get killed by 20b/4k preds and whatnot all the time but I don't really care. I'm old and used to gaming before matchmaking even existed and use getting wrecked as motivation to get better (Grinding Quake 3/4 Duels was my jam). It's only fun when it's apples to apples though, not when one person has 40% of their aim automated.\n\nRanked is meant to be hard. People complaining because they can't get diamond is crazy to me. I agree though that teammates and enemies should be based on a step of actual rank and being a platinum against a masters/pred should be impossible.\n\nIn my opinion the best ranked system would be a percentile distribution without any fixed numbers. Everything should work like the pred cap. The top 1% of players should be masters, the top 8% should be diamond, etc. You should be able to fall out of ranks as well if you get surpassed. The idea is that ranked will be a more accurate representation of skill and the season 17 free masters debacle can't happen again.\n\nRegarding solo queuing I think either entry cost should be reduced, or you are put into dedicated lobbies where everyone is solo. I think the queue times would be too long doing the latter however. I only solo queue so definitely feel the pain, it's hard but that's what it is.",
            "At certain points they need to have bot lobby. 40 games without a single win is starting to feel bad. Multiple matches without landing a kill feel bad. And seeing a master/pred dropping next to you when you are at 0.5 K/D feel bad.\n\nHonestly. .I am not so sure this game want return player or new player at alll.",
            "I've an overall 3.4kd. Highest rank Pred. Stopped playing last month due to issues outlined below.\n\nRanked is bad because everyone ends up in Plat, playing against Preds and cheaters. You can change it to diamond but without removing the cheaters it's still going to be bad.\n\nThree stack preds will always run diamond lobbies but there will be a lot less of them if the anti-cheat can be more successful.\n\nCasual should have no SBMM outside the newbie playlist. It currently means that all good players can play against cheaters and preds/masters in Ranked or cheaters and preds/masters in casual. So they are quitting and the player count is falling. As a result you have to widen the skill ranges for matchmaking meaning more and more people are facing this master/pred/cheater hellscape. \n\nThere will be poorer players who don't think the cheating issue is bad because they're not matched with them due to SBMM. It is. It is real bad. I can't play a game of mixtape without one obvious cheater in the opposition team, so there's probably one on my team too.\n\nBelow average players then should just play Ranked as it'll be easier than casual, obviously you can't hard reset the ranks every season with this set-up as you'll leave poorer players nowhere to go and you'll have the same problem you have now. With the bottom end of the spectrum player count leaving instead of the top. You'd also have to be open about the matchmaking and tell people where to play, in-game. As poorer/casual players aren't as likely to read the patch notes.\n\nYou'd also need to actually combat smurfing as we can't have bad players being farmed by smurfs in their only safe play space. Start with lengthy timed bans.\n\nThat's my solution. I know lots of poorer players think it'd make their experience worse but if Ranked LP was based on accurately placing people on skill and not just trying to increase play time I believe it would work. I'm so sure it will work because it's how I learned to play FPS games on Halo 5. Started bronze and couldn't touch casual without being farmed and slowly but surely over months made it to Diamond before moving to PUBG.",

            "I'd like to see a simpler more transparent system:  \n 1. Ranked with rank based matchmaking  \n 2. Pubs with a random lobby (no matchmaking)\n\nThere should be enough data by now to tune the ranked RP and match cost to normalise everyone into a bell curve.  \n  \nIn pubs, on average, I expect to encounter an average player most of the time. Left/right tail players are inherently rarer, so the likelihood of encountering them often, is lower.\n\nRanked should regress to competing against players of a similar skill. Pubs, I expect to be chaotic, with more RNG.\n\nATM it feels like you're competing against the algorithm at least as much as the lobby. I don't pretend to understand the hidden matchmaking in ranked, but anecdotally it has felt like more of a grind since it was introduced.\n\nAlso, please bring back a ranked TDM mode for people who insist on playing every game mode like a TDM.",

The fact that level 10s are getting placed with top players for sure puts off potential new player's wanting to try out the game. Same thing in ranked on my other account i came back to the game started in rookie and was facing master player's. I see no world where actual new player's want to stick around because they just get hard stomped.

            "My 5 cents as one of those potato players, scam player, useless noobs and other beautiful things I have read here\n\nI'm bad, and my friends are bad, we don't deserve to be more than silver probably and we never aim for it. We play twice per week, casual players (I hope we deserve to play this game...) and we don't aim to improve a lot cos we have no time for it (sadly)\n\nIn other seasons we were playing ranked, usually we were paired with people in our level and that was cool, we were winning 3 or 4 games per week, but I'd say 70% of games were fun. Other reason to play ranked is because players are not rushers, with 21% acc in short range we can not rush, but we can have chances long / mid distance were we are slightly better, in ranked more people try to survive and then we can play our game and enjoy it more.\n\nUsually we were not playing trios because there we were always being devastated or in most of the games only 4 teams passed the first ring and then try to find them.\n\nIn this season ranked is hell, we are in silver and people can kill you with an r-99 from the other side of the map, other player movements are just way better than ours, and half of the matches we get wiped out by 1 solo guy...\n\nYes, we are bad, we know, but in the 3 previous season there were people with same skills than us and we were having fun. Now, fun is gone.\n\nWe truly believe the matchmaking should be skill based, I can not be paired with someone with 60% acc, impossible movements and 5k damage in last match! because is impossible we can kill him!, then is not fun for me neither for them (unless those rat kids). And is insane when you enter into a ranked game and the champions is always a copper guy, sometimes even playing alone... with the badge of 3.5k damage... you already know you will be wiped out by a smurf or a hacker or a bot\n\nIn all games, you find smurfs or hackers or both of them, I'd say 80% of the games we get wiped out by one of them meanwhile in the other season maybe only the 30%.\n\nAnd even is worst when trying to play without my friends solo, then I'm paired with them!!! WTF!!! I don't want to play with someone who carries me till the last ring, let me die and lose my points because I don't want to move up in the ladder, I want to have fun! I want to be in a one to one that I can lose or win...\n\nI'd expect to play against teams with my skill set, and I don't care if I need to wait 3 or 5 min for it, at least I know the game will be nice. I'd expect those 60% up acc to be paired together, this way hackers and pros can have fun with same skills.\n\nI really hope we can go 2 seasons back, I hope even in silver when you lose, you lose mmr and not be forced to scale in the ladder. If you want people to scale fast, good, give them mmr based on skill, hey man, awesome, 4k damage you alone, 70% acc, congrats! move him copper to gold and have fun!",
            "Its not really the matchmaking that forces me out of the game, okay, when i get some better players in my lobby that just means i suck, but what i cant stand is when they oneclip you just because of input with aimassit. 1v1s are nearly impossible to win against 40% aimbot. So either nerfing aimassit (and implementing moving while looting for rollers) or just make input matchmaking to separate mnk players from controller ones, would make so much better experience for the ones on mnk who are nowadays switching to controllers or quitting the game",

They need to stop anyone from not being in the same tier (maybe 1 rank diff, gold 1 to plat 4, plat 4 to plat 2) as it's unfair for solo queues such as myself to play with golds against even diamonds.\n\nThe splits need to stop I enjoyed it so much being able to grind, as i don't play too much second split cause there's no point, as long as I achieved my rank in split 1, i really don't care about playing. I have played against top preds 300 below, including 50, and 6 MANNING. \n\nThe entry fee is to high for most players to lose against horrible matchmaking and bad servers, crashing, logging me out and charging me for penalty.\n\nIts not only ranked, solos has been unplayable as I have to 1v1 masters, diamonds and preds, please give matchmaking (properly) to all the LTM's and mix tape modes, its to unfair for me and I know lots of people feel the same way.",

Using statistics, it should be clear that you will on average fight 0.95-1.05 kd players as they make up the bulk of players. You\u2019d rarely fight the top players and rarely fight the worst players. And you can even have a low skill playlist for sub 0.7 kd players or new players to help.

I have played since S0, I have a 2.8 lifetime kd and I have hit masters twice when I actually try. \n\nNow, because I play a bit less I cannot compete and enjoy myself cuz the matchmaking is cranked up to absolute 11.

Rank would be easier and we'd get more diamond and master players, but it would be better than it is now. I played rank for a while in PT and the atmosphere was always terrible as everyone would get angry at Cheetahs. So I started playing solo. The match quality is the worst because D4 and P4 players can't get to the next tier and start throwing the game.

            "My feedback is Ranked matchmaking is fine.\n\n  \nWhat mode are you talking about? - RANKED\n\n  \nWhat do you consider good/bad/fair matchmaking \\[in that mode\\]? What do you think is healthiest, individually and/or for the player base as a whole (across skill levels)? Playing against others within your earned/visible rank for the most part(e.g. Golds face Golds but I understand if Diamonds have to face Masters sometimes given the lower population)\n\n  \nWhat kind of matchmaking do you want for ranked/pubs/mixtape/solos? \\[possibly: completely random matchmaking; loose skill based matchmaking/tight skill based matchmaking; loose rank based matchmaking in ranked/tight rank based matchmaking; something else\\] For anything not Ranked, just have matchmaking be random like the good old days(Halo veteran here - The idea of evening out the skills in non ranked is still alien to me)  \nWhat kind of matchmaking are you experiencing (vs what you want from that mode)? In what ways is it a problem? I only played Ranked\n\n  \nHow do you assess the strength of your lobby / strength of players you are facing? Badges (which ones) / trackers / current rank / ...? Good, balanced lobbies within Ranked(nearly Diamond at the moment but do not have enough free time to play more)\n\n  \nWhat is your current rank? Plat II  \nWhat is your skill level (highest previously achieved ranks)? Masters  \nHow should matchmaking deal with parties of varied skill (or rank) / how does it deal with it / how good/bad is the experience (and again it's important to distinguish whether you're talking about ranked or pubs here)? Ranked solo queuer - When moving up the ranks I sometimes see - for example, when I am gold my duo teammates will be a Gold and Silver player and the silver player is clearly out of their depth. It can be frustrating but it does not occur often enough to be a problem\n\n  \nWith regards to smurfing: How much of a problem is / how does it affect your experience / how easy is it to do/how common is it / What to do against it? I know what this is but I do not see what the issue is and have not experienced this myself.  \nThoughts on ranked resets (their effect on matchmaking) Ranked resets are necessary to keep engagement high - I understand and support this. Perhaps a better end of season reward will help with this as well(e.g. 3 free gold packs if you reach one rank higher than your previous season's rank or something along those lines)\n\n  \nWhat is your experience of matchmaking in high ranks / matchmaking in low ranks? How does it match with what you expect from ranked? Higher ranks(e.g. Diamond and above) is a much better experience as every mistake has the potential to send you back to the lobby AND lose significant RP - players understand this at these higher ranks(mostly) and do their best to play as a team somewhat - at the lower ranks(through Gold), the consequences of mistakes are almost non existent due to lack of general skill of the lobbies to make you pay and, if so, the RP loss is minimal and most times you break out even or slightly ahead. so most folks just play as if it is pubs and push everything, rotate late, go INTO the storm to fight etc... Plat lobbies seem to have a mix of both types of players and has the balance of being competitive but without the huge RP losses from a mistake if you already won a fight or 2.  \nThe above mostly focuses on \"skill\", but since it's come up recently from time to time (with XDefiant as well), \n\nwhat are your views on input based matchmaking (including potentially negative effects it might have on all of the above). Remember to please keep it civil as this is a topic that constantly leads to toxicity and incivility / personal attacks, rather than level-headed discussion of arguments. I play on controller I do not see an issue here  \n  \nI do not play pubs  \nI will say that as a solo queuer, it would be nice if we could be matched with other like minded players in matchmaking in terms of playstyle? i am not sure how you could pull this off but maybe something as simple as a one question survey a player can fill out at the start of each login  \n'Today I want to play the following playstyle:  \nA. Rotate Early and often  \nB. Push Everything  \nC. Defender  \nD etc'  \nAnd then try your best to match players together who answered the same(e.g. put players on teams who answered A together) This could encourage more team play and lower the amount of frustration for solo queuers.",
            "What about NewGame+?\n\nWhen a player hits Predator, they open up two options - 1. Standard matchmaking against other preds and Masters like always, and 2. a new ranked mode, NewGame+\n\nIn NewGame+, Predators start over in Bronze with a heavy increase in damage taken and a heavy decrease in damage they can give. The modifiers would start off very high but lessen with each successive rank so they're always underpowered, but less so as they climb. The goal is to overcome the handicap by using their game knowledge to get all the way back to predator rank, and they can earn a badge.\n\nThis would improve wait times, and more people could benefit from the skill of a predator player on their team without them rolling a lobby. They have to play smart to overcome the fact that everyone else in the lobby hits harder now and takes less damage from them. \n\nPerhaps playing NewGame+ puts a '+' by their name when they play in that mode, and maybe a slight glow that decreases each rank for other players to recognize.

            "Below is from a ranked perspective.\n\nThe system is not in a good place right now.\n\nThe real solution is bring back the system from a couple seasons ago that \\*actually\\* had skill based matchmaking.  The matches in those seasons were very fun and balanced matches throughout.  Some of the best Apex I've ever played.  Now, the actual visible ranking in those seasons made no real sense and was a (rightful) complaint of people, but imo who cares if it created actual fun matches in the end.\n\nBut I know that will never happen because most people have been brainwashed to think SBMM is the root of all evil and complain about it religiously, even though the frustration we see this season is the perfect example of why SBMM is \\*good\\* and important to have.\n\nSo that said, let's fix THIS system.\n\nThere are 2 main problems in the current system.\n\n1. Progressing through ranks is very time consuming.  Between the extremely low soft kill cap and amount of RP needed per level, smurfers get to enjoy games for tens of hours before getting even remotely to where they're supposed to be.  It ruins the game for both sides.  The \"don't play for a few weeks after new season or split\" is sadly not just a meme, but honestly very true.  The quality of matches are a disaster until 2-3 weeks after a season launch, which is not a good thing for a live service game, especially when the split repeats this every 6 weeks or so.\n2. At the same time, progressing through ranks is WAY too easy, to a point.  This may sound contradictory to #1, but the problem is that any player WILL eventually make it to gold, given enough time because of the way RP costs escalate.  Even if you're pretty bad at the game, if you play enough, chances are very high you'll make it there because you're just not penalized enough for losing games pre-gold.  This creates a problem where nearly everyone ends up stuck in gold because platinum is the only time you're actually challenged to \\*consistently\\* play well to advance due to RP costs.\n\nThe fixes need to be either one or (ideally) both of these things.\n\n1. The soft kill cap needs to be adjusted up, probably to 10-12.  It's honestly baffling that it's capped at 6, which is a number fairly easy to reach most matches for average skill players even if you're ratting because you'll find a few stray kills in the final circle regardless.  The RP gain between a person who gets a normal 6 kills/assists game being in the bracket they belong, and a pred who just got 20 that match is just too small.  The good players need to advance to where they should be quickly, this reduces the amount of time smurfers can cause a bad time for other players.\n2. Controversial one, but RP entry costs need to be adjusted upward in earlier ranks and honestly, should probably be flat amount across rank categories.  When matchmaking is directly tied to rank, it's nearly pointless to have escalating costs like this except maybe in the very highest ranks where people are competing for top predator ranks.\n\nMost of the problem with current system is that it's merely an inevitability to get to gold, then it's decently easy to get through gold if you're an average to slightly above average player, but then platinum is a hard roadblock to most.  The sharp RP entry cost increase means you suddenly go from needing to have one good game in every 5 or 6 in gold to advance, to needing to be \"consistently\" good in your games to get anywhere in plat.  It means a massive portion of playerbase (with a massive variety of skill levels) is hard stuck at gold just playing each other there, creating bad and unfair matches (I think people often confuse \"predator player\" with \"skill mismatch\", which I think is what most of this is.  Most of us can look like predators with 15 kill games if we're playing people far below our skill)\n\nRealistically, if it was -40 RP (probably more like -50 or -60 if adjusting the soft kill cap up) cost across the board from Bronze to diamond, this means you now have to generally consistently be good to move up the rankings.  This means that only the truly good and players above that bracket would rise up, and we wouldn't have to wait as long for the pred players to get out of the average player brackets (which would likely become more in the bronze and silver tiers) and lead to more fun competitive matches quicker after a season reset.\n\nThis change would likely be met with frustration and massive complaints from players who only play rank to \"grind\" however, because players are used to getting to gold for free and to suddenly be a \"bronze\" or \"silver\" player would make people mad.  But it frankly is needed if they want to tie MM to rank like this.\n\nAnd of course the final thing, Splits need to be removed.  I shouldn't even have to explain this, it makes NO sense.  Splits mean rank is being treated as something to grind as if it were XP to level up in a CoD game, when it needs to be treated as a form of matchmaking because they frankly ARE using it for matchmaking.",

            "Ranked is probably in the best state compared to some of the previous seasons, the exclusions of sbmm has been great, and removing the promo trials was a great qol change.

If a revised reset isn\u2019t going to be considered this may be the better alternative, sbmm should stay out of rank but maybe consider a cap for ranks you can que into. For example rookies won\u2019t play higher than silver 1, bronze, silver, gold 3 and below play together. Gold 2 and up play up to plat 1 etc. making some tighter parameters beyond the party that can be formed without reintroducing sbmm would be something to consider. Playing with a silver player as a plat is always frustrating, in silver it\u2019s almost impossible to lose points and people want to push everything to rack up as many points possible in a short amount of time. Higher ranks normally have a different more methodical approach all together.  Introducing a small buy in reduction for solo players would also be a good incentive.",

And then there would be a lot of posts that are asking for more players in the lobbies. \n\nThe thing that makes someone better than someone else is the existence of the person who is below them. And this is why no one should chase away trash players. The sentiment should be more along the lines of, \"thank you for playing and please keep staying here because your presence makes me look better.\" \n\nThis is why people create Smurf accounts is because they miss that feeling of stomping on others. Not so easy to stomp on other people when the ranks get up higher because the ranking system is so broken. \n\nI think that Apex could fix it by not requiring a certain amount of players per lobby and then they could just have a hard rule that people only play against their own exact rank, even if there's literally only four people in the lobby. maybe they could adjust it so that the speed at which the ring closes is increased based on how few players there are.",

For that the matchmaking has to actually be good at producing even skill lobbies (which ranked based matchmaking isn't because it's open to playing below your skill level if you just use one of the various methods of tanking your rank, including creating new accounts, having resets work in your favour etc, but not limited to this).\n\nA flat entry cost means that \"winning\" means the same thing regardless of rank.\n\nIt makes no sense that 6th and 3 kills in diamond is somehow losing, when in plat or gold it's a decent plus RP game (\"winning\").\n\nIt makes no sense that when you get 6th and 3 kills against weak gold and plat players you gain points from it, but when you pull off the same perfeormance against even better players in diamond (which is more difficult to do) you are suddenly losing RP.\n\nRespawn already know that and they've explained that exact point themselves in the the ranked blogs on season 17/18/19. Unfortunately they've forgot all that and reverted to a populist ranked system.\n\nAs you correctly put it:\n\n>But I know that will never happen because most people have been brainwashed to think SBMM is the root of all evil and complain about it religiously, even though the frustration we see this season is the perfect example of why SBMM is *good* and important to have.\n\n--\n\n>smurfers get to enjoy games for tens of hours before getting even remotely to where they're supposed to be.

            "I think one of the biggest reasons the MMR system felt bad in regards to visible rank is that the \"skill\" RP boost (bonus points handed out in games if your MMR was significantly higher than your current visible rank) either flat out didn't really work, or was way too conservative.\n\nIt almost never dished out bonus points and when it did, it would be tiny amounts.  It should have been the factor that helped people actually quickly get to a rank representative of their MMR rather than it feeling like a massive grind.\n\nAnd most importantly in that system, the generic RP entry costs per rank category didn't make sense either.  Your RP loss should have been based on your visible rank relative to your MMR in the inverse way skill bonus points worked (ie, if your rank is Plat, but your MMR is like mid silver, you should lose extra RP on a bad loss to push your actual rank closer down to where your MMR shows it should be), which would have stopped the \"rank inflation\" that people complained about (of course this would result in other complaints of people being mad about how they think they're unfairly losing too much RP because their MMR is invisible and people can't easily understand why they lose extra, so this wouldn't have been perfect either)\n\nBut again, I've accepted we will probably never get that system back.  I just wish they would've experimented more mid-season with adjusting ranked when it's clear something's broken or people don't like it.

That was a more competitive experience.\n\n> If Respawn was willing to throw people directly into their correct rank after placements instead of forcing them to grind, there might have been fewer complaints.\n\nIt is easy to say that but this doesn't work.\n\nRanked needs good matchmaking, lobbies of as even in skill as possible, you acknowledge that in your comment.\n\nTo do that ranked matchmaking needs the numbers to work with. it needs players playing the game consistently throughout the season.\n\nThe \"grind\" is for two things really:\n\n1 To earn your rewards, yes.\n\nbut there's an important second side to it\n\n2 You need the progression system (the ranking up, the grind) to keep people playing to in turn have enough people queuing at all times to get a good even skill lobby of 60 people, no matter when in the season you play, and no matter at what skill level (or rank).\n\nIf you give people their rank after 10 games, that directly discourages that and will lead to bad matchmaking.\n\nUltimately ranked isn't \"to get the reward at the end\", instead it's a place to provide competitive games.\n\nThe ranked progression, the grind, is a means to that end as well. it helps ranked provide consistently competitive games throughout the whole season. That's what it did in season 18 and 19.\n\nNow it doesn't, because matchmaking doesn't care about skill, because the ranked system resets everyone to bronze which produces a mess in matchmaking. But the grind is still there, and always will be.\n\nYou just seem to think the grind is more acceptable because a lot of it is stomping weaker players (until you get to a rank where games become difficult). That's really a bad approach. These are really games that shouldn't be taking place in ranked. More like pubs. There shouldn't ever be matchups with such high skill disparity in ranked. And it's also wrong to make the grind more appealing to people by giving them easy games to  stomp in in ranked.\n\nWe don't get good enough matchmaking in ranked now because people just abuse ranked to smurf in low ranks. They stomp rookie, bronze, silver, gold.\n\nHere's a guy who was diamond+ last season (top 1-2%) and then went on 2 smurf accounts to stomp low ranks for 400 games with a k/d of 3 (1200 kills).\n\nThese kinds of people spend 100s of games below their rank, but they never show up in matchmaking for high skill games in diamond or master lobbies. Instead plats and gold players are filled into these games, while people like this are starting over on another account in rookie or bronze.\n\nSo tldr the grind is a necessary part to ranked in any system, because you need people constantly playing the game and not stopping after 10 games when they earned their rank. They should consistently play the whole season to earn their rank but also so ranked is a good environment for competitive games and matchmaking has the numbers to make that happen (if it's actually sensible matchmaking, and not based on your RP / rank which you can easily manipulate to play below your rank)",

            "Everything here is just my opinion on the matter. \n\n1. Early on OG Fortnite didn't have SBMM and the experience for avg players wasn't good. It's why they added it eventually. The companies look at so much data and it was determined it was a good business decision.\n\n2. I mean the companies collect the data (they just don't share it) and given the majority implement SBMM these days (even XDefiant up to a certain level) I think that speaks for itself.\n\n3. I would argue most smurfs are mostly to get easy lobbies/not have long queue times. I mean every streamer does this. It's not so they can play with friends and well, monkey see monkey do right. \n\n4. This exists because of a poor matchmaking system because they don't want to alienate the top players. I don't think it's reasonable of them to do that personally as the majority is where the money is at, but they try their hardest to appease the top 1% and if that means sacrificing lower skilled they do it. Personally I think it's smarter from a business standpoint to not appease the top because the game over time gets a high barrier to entry as everyone's skills go up over the years. That's what we see with Apex. The only way a game thrives is to constantly be bringing in new players and Apex is bad at this because that skill gap isn't handled very well (and it's a game with a lot of skills to learn). Removing SBMM would only exacerbate that.\n\n  \nxDefiant is a well done game for sure, but it's 55th in viewers on twitch at the moment and it's a new well done game, plus, I don't think the avg player plays it because it doesn't have SBMM over a certain level. If anything I'm willing to bet over time the player number drops because once ppl start getting over that level value they see a lot of ass kickings happening (even more obvious in a game style like that) and that'll get old real fast. It shot up in popularity because it's a well designed game, it's a new and nice looking game, and it's free. So I think it's too early to use it as any sort of case study in SBMM.",

It was something I've often been advocating for though within this system. IMO if you reached master at some point (in a season where it means master at least), you should really never drop lower than diamond. You'll never become a plat player or worse magically by not playing. You should never have to proof you can make it out of silver, gold or plat.\n\nSimilarly someone who made diamond in a normal season will never become a gold player again.\n\nBut what is true that ranked resets haven't been as extreme as they are now ever.\n\nIn season 20 everyone was reset to rookie, and then again reset by 1.5 ranks mid season 20.\n\nNow in 21, it's effectively the same with everyone dropping to bronze iv (unless you didn't make it out of rookie last season, then you are rookie iv).\n\nNormally you were reset 1.5 ranks at the start of the season and mid season. Not a full reset (say diamond to bronze is 4 ranks, master to bronze 4 is 5 ranks, that's crazy when matchmaking just looks at rank and then puts masters in the same game as silver peakers).\n\n>do we need matchmaking too opaque and complex to manipulate?\n\nI want MMR based matchmaking back in ranked.\n\nIt made smurfing virtually impossible, it was virtually impossible to manipulate the matchmaking and at the same time it made sure you get competitive / sweaty games from the start of the season.

There is no basis for expecting a huge influx of players. Most people don't care they have to play with people on a different input and aren't actually quitting the game because of it. In reality you just split the queues now and even if there is a slight bump in player numbers, it will not outweigh the split.

            "20 years? That's amazing! You get paid to work as a programmer? What projects have you worked on? I'd love to know more about the day to day life of an employed programmer.",
            "I agree that it's not a punishment. I was just pointing out that that is how the three stacks will see it. They will see it as being penalized for grouping up because they start out with a higher cost. You know it's true.",
            "This is easy to argue against\n\nIf you want to argue against Steam's own stats, go for it but I don't see why they'd lie about that.\n\npc has higher framerate\n\nTell that to people playing on an older computer averaging 60fps or less. Where's their bonus aim assist boost? Oh wait, aim assist is not tied to performance at all. I have no idea who first made up that lie, but it's completely irrelevant to the aim assist discussion.\n\n(I accidentally replied on mobile if u got 2 notifications)",
            "I'll reply to this one and try and hit on all 3 of your comments u left.\u00a0I will no longer be discussing AA itself after being banned for it this weekend lol. In terms of the 90% stat, that's overall play sessions across steam which is pc's biggest gaming platform. Another version of that I found from RPS is \"12% of players regularly use controllers\".\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0The reason this is indicative of some possible theoretical imbalance is that you'd expect FPS games to be amomg the most mnk favored of all genres up there with like RTS. So if 90% of game sessions use mnk, which accounts for genres like RPGs, platformers, racing games, sports games, where you'd expect a lot of controller use, FPS games would be expected to be even higher than that 90% mnk.\u00a0So it is odd to me that apex legends specifically has such a tiny mnk minority left playing.\n\n\n\u00a0 As for profits, recent quarterly reports actually suggest the opposite of what you're saying, and respawn/ea is pretty desperate to increase Apex's profits to what it used to be\u00a0 https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1afdz35/ea_quarterly_results_apex_legends_did_not_meet/",
            "If AA is tied to fps, how come low fps pc players don't get more computer aim for free?\n\n\nAnd if .6 isn't a problem, why is it banned in competitive play where the game is marginally more fair? Perhaps because if it wasn't, most pros would feel forced to switch to console or miss out on 50% bonus computer aim?",
            "I agree that the majority percent of people should not have to accommodate the tiny 10% of people... A world where the greater percentage has to accommodate the smaller percentage is just crazy but that's where we find ourselves in more than just Apex. And Apex seems to be all about accommodating the smaller percent. Especially since their profits have just been steadily increasing..",

            "It is a restriction, there's no arguing that. That's a mathematical fact.\n\n>and when making teams you prefer to pair quitters with other quitters and pair non-quitters with other non-quitters but otherwise the matchmaking works the same.\n\nYeah that needs more players in the queue to achieve the same matchmaking quality because now you have an additional criterion that needs to fit. aka it's a restriction.\n\nOverall rage quitting makes the game worse and they should find ways to reduce it. Not stuff that has questionable effect like \"putting quitters together\". Whenever I read this kinda stuff (similarly \"don't ban cheaters, just put them together in the same lobby\") I can't help but think what a meme and how backwards this is.",
            ">How? It's the same people in the same lobbies, just sorted differently. Sorting 60 players along a one-dimensional axis based on a single criterion won't affect queuing times even for a split second.\n\nNo.\n\nYou're not understanding how matchmaking works and what the resources relevant for matchmaking are (queuing population and time window).\n\nMatchmaking has a time window in which it collects players to then see which of these can form a lobby.\n\nAn additional requirement on those players means it 1) either needs a larger number of players (increased queue time) to achieve the same matchmaking quality (how closely people in the lobby are in skill) or 2) it keeps queue time the same but then has worse quality because statistically a lower number of players results in worse matchmaking quality. \n\n>Besides not all quitters are griefers, a lot of them just want a fast paced game\n\nIf you serially quit prematurely (before you are eliminated) you are a griefer. You grief lobby after lobby after lobby. People can get a timeout if they do it twice in 5 games for instance, without penalizing every abandon (like ranked does or mixtape). Overall it just makes people not quit. People who are sitting in an abandon penalty missing from matchmaking queues isn't a problem, because they aren't playing the game anyway. Even if matchmaking puts them into a lobby based on their skill (and other parameters), when they abandon on knock or similar they aren't what matchmaking is looking for, when it looks for people who will play a full game together and are of similar skill. It's like leaving a slot on the team empty almost. It's good if rage quitters sit in abandon penalties and can't grief 20 games an hour with serial rage quitting.\n\nOverall you're not entitled to serially griefing other people's games so you get to grief the next game a minute earlier. Pubs has consistently deteriorated from what it was 2-3 years ago when it wasn't time for an abandon penalty yet. Ultimately I wouldn't be surprised if pubs gets abandon penalties as well.\n\n>Hell, there are even people who quit straight after a win and turn to death boxes\n\nCool story but no one cares, because they aren't abandoning the game, they are free to do that. If you do that in ranked you don't get a penalty either.",
            "I'm a physicist so I write code for research. This tangent arising from you personally attacking me because I called out your suggestion is straying further away from topic though. Stick to the topic please. You haven't addressed any of the on topic stuff.",

            "Why would you expect FPS games to be among the most mouse and keyboard favored of all genres? I personally expect the opposite.",
            "Input latency is the major disadvantage, and console players have much worse input latency than PC even at the same FPS. Seriously just go play both, this wouldn't even be a debate worth having if you've spent much time playing each. Some pros have tried out console 60 FPS and said they were shocked how much harder it was to aim.",
            "No. You can treat this as a restriction, which would require additional players to achieve the same matchmaking quality, or you can treat it as a preference that when possible pairs quitters to quitters and non-quitters with non-quitters otherwise it doesn\u2019t. The downside is that you may not notice a significant difference in how often you get paired with quitters because the matchmaker may need to ignore it most of the time.",

This would be an aspect of team balancing, which occurs *after* the lobby is already created.\n\nFrom the dev blog on matchmaking: \n\n> # MATCHING\n\n> Finally, the matching algorithm is responsible for determining who\u2019s in your game. Using the skill rating, it will group players together to form a match. Squads and matches are formed based on player availability. This algorithm must balance speed vs quality\u2014should we form a match quickly but with higher skill differences, or should we wait a bit longer for more closely matched opponents?\n\n> Once we have selected the possible players going into the match, there remains two big questions: \n\n> 1. How do we form squads?\n\n> 2. How do we pair squads against squads?\n\n> There are several methods that matching can be done, but let\u2019s explore this in the next section!\n\nThis would fall into category 1, how do we form squads. As you can see, it would have no effect on the matching algorithm finding eligible players for the lobby, so the concerns you brought up are not relevant since they specifically relate to finding eligible players for a lobby. As they said, it\u2019s the same 60 players in the lobby, you just form the squads in a different manner.\n\nEdit: just realized you are the same person I already explained this to, so this comment is probably pointless :/",
            "Based on the fact that most pc players play mouse and keyboard, I conclude that opening a pc game up to mouse and keyboard players would increase the player count of the game by a lot. That's a pretty logical conclusion, no?\n\n\n\u00a0And for your last part, is that really that surprising? I thought it was well known. Do you know where you first heard that lie that AA value is actually based on FPS and not arbitrary?",
            "Aiming in shooter games is a lot like moving a cursor on a screen. A mouse offers a lot more precision for a task like that than a joystick can, so most fps games have been intended and designed to be played with mouse. There's definitely big console shooter IPs but those have generally not been super popular outside of north America. And for shooters built for PC, they're almost exclusively better played with a mouse",
            "There's no \"or\" here. It factually affects matchmaking. There's no arguing here.\n\nIt's an ineffective idea anyway that does nothing to the rage quitting issue.",
            "There is no point in balancing teams to put quitters together. It doesn't do anything about the problem at all. It doesn't reduce the amount of rage quitting.\n\nrage quitters are a problem even when they are on the other teams. they make the lobby die out too fast, they make their remaining teammates too easy to beat and they render ring pressure irrelevant and a proper end game nonexistent. something needs to be done that works to get rid of most of the quitting."

You may even have a small chance to obtain a Blue or Purple kitted weapon! Unfortunately, Tridents are too small to squeeze a fourth on board, but let \u2018em walk. If you\u2019re more of a team player, there\u2019s always Evac Towers or Valkyrie\u2019s Ult.

Those are locked in before the Ranked Rumble becomes available. How will YOU stack up against everyone else in your Rank?\n\n\n#PATCH NOTES\n\n**BALANCE UPDATES**\n\n**Care Package**\n\n- Purple light mag added\n\n**Gold Weapons Rotation**\n\n- Nemesis Burst AR, Triple-Take, Peacekeeper, Prowler PDW, Longbow DMR\n\n**End Rings**\n\n- End rings now have more even distribution through the map\n\n- Each quadrant of the map now have roughly 25% chance of getting selected\n\n**Survival Slot Items**\n\n- Survival slot items have been redistributed to low tier loot zones\n\n*Dev Note: Survival slot items were not spawning in all our loot quality zones. This adjustment maintains a similar number of survival slot items in a match but more evenly distributes them across the map.*\n\n**WEAPONS & ATTACHMENTS**\n\n**G7 Scout**\n\n- Damage increased to 33 (was 32)\n\n- Rate of fire increased\n\n- Adjusted recoil to be more consistent when firing at max fire rate\n\n*Dev Note: The G7 has felt a little underwhelming and our data backs that up. When we were evaluating its rate of fire we realized its recoil could use a pass as well so we\u2019ve smoothed out what we think the roughest spots are and given it a little more damage. This should help the G7 be competitive with the rest of our marksman and sniper roster.*\n\n**Havoc Rifle**\n\n- All mag sizes reduced\n\n    - No Mag: 20 (was 24)\n\n    - White Mag: 24 (was 28)\n\n    - Blue Mag: 28 (was 32)\n\n    - Purple Mag: 32 (was 36)\n\n*Dev Note: The Havoc is a force to be reckoned with, even without all the bells and whistles of mags and turbochargers it still puts in work. However, 36 rounds in a kitted Havoc, even with the firing delay, represents high damage up time and forgiveness for wasted rounds (often experienced during prefiring). Pulling back on mags allows it to remain deadly, but requires a little more precision.*\n\n**Longbow DMR**\n\n- Headshot multiplier increased to 2.25 (was 2.15)\n\n**R-99 SMG**\n\n- Reduced hip-fire randomness \n\n*Dev Note: Over the last few patches we nerfed the R-99 because it was a significant outlier, performing well above the rest of the pack. Those nerfs were substantial and the R-99 has fallen a little too far for our liking and is feeling unreliable. These adjustments intend to bring up its consistency without directly increasing its damage potential.*\n\n**Rampage LMG**\n\n- Firing animation has less vertical movement while in ADS\n\n**Weapon Rarity Sets**\n\n- Peacekeeper (Blue and Purple)\n\n    - Optic updated to 1x Hcog (was 2x Bruiser)\n\n- Charge Rifle & Sentinel (Purple)\n\n    - Optic updated to 4-8x (was 2-4x)\n\n    - Gunrun will keep a 2-4x\n\n**4x-10x Digital Threat Scope**\n\n- Will no longer provide threat vision through smoke or gas\n\n**LEGENDS**\n\n**Alter**\n\n- Void Passage: Crypto EMP will now affect all players phased by the Void Passage\n\n**Bangalore**\n\n- Smoke Launcher: all players within smoke will now have a white highlight visible to other players in smoke within 20m\n\n*Dev Note: Fighting inside Bangalore's smoke has never been a pleasant experience for players or viewers (aside from you Bloodhounds) as it makes fights messy and hard to read. We are leveling the playing field now by making all players inside smoke clearer targets to one another with a white highlight. This highlight is not visible from outside the smoke: all of the rotational and sight-blocking gameplay are kept in-tact. However, while playing inside the smoke will be more clear, it will also be more risky and resets will be much harder if the smoke is challenged.*\n\n**Bloodhound**\n\n- Beast of the Hunt: threat vision is no longer visible through smoke or gas\n\n- Upgrade: Level 2\n\n    - Raven\u2019s Blessing: Ult charge reduced to 20% (was 25%)\n\n- Upgrades: Level 3\n\n    - NEW Sighthound: reduced Tac cooldown by 50% while Ultimate is active\n\n    - NEW Flock: remove enemy range requirement for White Raven spawns\n\n*Dev Note: Sometimes even the best teams break up and go their separate ways. Bloodhound's Ult has always had a strong synergy with Bangalore\u2019s smoke, but the pairing has recently become dominant and a singular answer to the \"can't see stuff\" meta. With the removal of threat vision through smoke, Bloodhound will need to rely on their Tac scan like other Recon Legends. This should remove the necessity for the dynamic duo to pair together and allow for new roster compositions to form in its wake.*\n\n*We were noticing how much the White Raven passive would fall off in the late game as enemies are naturally closer, making Raven\u2019s Blessing upgrade much less valuable after the first ring. The new Level 3 upgrade will allow players to play off White Ravens across the match and fuel their Ult more effectively.*\n\n*Alternatively, players can now tap back into some of Bloodhound\u2019s old scan potential while in their Ult. These changes aim to shift power away from simply securing knocks for late game benefit and into more opportunities to use the Ult or the Tac through new upgrade choices.*\n\n[see full table of updated perks on original article]\n\n**Pathfinder**\n\n- Upgrade: Level 3\n\n    - Down & Away: Tac will now refresh on BOTH knocks and assisted knocks within a 3s window\n\n**Revenant**\n\n- Upgrade: Level 3\n\n    - Grim Leaper: Tac will now refresh on BOTH knocks and assisted knocks within a 3s window\n\n**MAPS**\n\n- PUBS: Broken Moon / Kings Canyon / Olympus\n\n- RANKED: Broken Moon / Olympus / World\u2019s Edge\n\n\n**MODES**\n\n**Quads**\n\n- Replacing Duos Playlist for S21.1\n\n- 15 Teams of 4 Players\n\n- Loot Improvements\n\n    - Chance to find Blue/Purple kitted weapons\n\n    - Increased ammo in Light, Heavy, and Energy ammo boxes\n\n    - Increased chance to find ammo, health, shield, scopes, and deployable items\n\n    - Increased Replicator starting count 12\u219215\n\n- Lobby supports a 4th player for inviting and \u2018Previous Match Squad Members\u2019\n\n- Legend Ability updates to support a 4th squad member\n\n    - Mirage Decoy shows 4 squad members when dropping from the dropship\n\n    - Valkyrie\u2019s Ult allows for up to 3 additional squad members to attach\n\n    - Vantage Passive can spot the armor on all enemy teammates when in ADS\n\n    - Loba\u2019s Ultimate has UI to support a fourth player\n\nNOTE: Quads is the only mode that supports queueing with 4 players.

Ranked entry cost, placement, and KP tuning updated to:\n\n- Lower entry cost above Bronze Tier\n\n    - Gold: 35 (was 40)\n\n    - Platinum: 55 (was 60)\n\n    - Diamond: 75 (was 80)\n\n- Placement RP Tuning now follows ALGS rules that all Top 15 will gain points\n\n    - 15th: 5 (was 0)\n\n    - 14th: 5 (was 0)\n\n- Kill Point Tuning\n\n    - 8th: 14 (was 12)\n\n    - 7th: 14 (was 12)\n\n    - 6th: 16 (was 12)\n\n*Dev Note: we have received valuable insights from last season's data and community feedback and made slight adjustments based on both. The entry cost above Bronze has been lowered slightly, all of the Top 15 players will now receive corresponding placement points, and increased the KP for players in the top 6th-8th positions. With the potential for more updates to come as we continue to monitor.*\n\n*We reward players for excellent strategic choices in placement and for outstanding combat performances in Kills. Achieving Top 5 placement in many ways is your strategic choice, but we won't reward you with additional points; you must validate your placement with eliminations.*\n\n\n**BUG FIXES**\n\nLooking for something else?

            "I find it funny how Bangalore was like the pinnacle of balance for like 4 years and now in this past last year she's had more changes than her entire inclusion in the game along with impacting so many other changes like  dig threats and bloodhound.",
            "> Added a settings option that adjusts the gameplay volume when spectating\n\nOMG, yes!\n\nSpectating sounds were too loud all the time for some reason.",
            "There is now ZERO reason to pick up the '4x-10x Digital Threat scope' sniper optic. It'd be perfect if it was a 2-6x or 2-8x, becoming the only scope to useable at two extremes... it has to the most useless legendary pick up in the game, 10x vs 8x makes no difference and I prefer the blue 6x or basic 2x compared to 4-8x.",

            "Feels like Revenant, Conduit, Lifeline, and Caustic all had their personalities mixed up lol.",
            "Just give Ash even a 1% buff. It's insane. They pretended for years like making her tac 1 handed would break the game and it literally barely buffed her.\u00a0 Her passive is useless 98% of the time, and anytime an Ash scans my kill I'mjust happy to know where she's coming from. Add one or both of her blue perks into her passive and give her new perks. That alone would be interesting an a nice qol and she still wouldn't be good but we can't even get that",
            "The nerf to Bangalore sounds horrible on first reading, but on second reading it's like hm? If smoke still disables Aim assist, then we now have Bang with wallhacks on her smoke, with double time to make it harder to hit at close range and enemies with diminished aim on controller. while a MnK Bang has literally all his aim plus wallhacks.... This sounds like an incredible unintentional buff.",

            "Can someone please explain to me how WarZone and Fortnite are able to have solos,duos,trios and quads as well other playlists and still function perfectly yet this game somehow thinks that's impossible? This will be by far my least played season since like season 2. Being forced to play trios with a random is borderline impossible, be it in ranked or pubs. First it was Respawn forcing their shitty LTMs on the trios pub playlist, now they get rid of a playlist for a whole season. Whoever is calling the shots over there is just lost. Hope the player base keeps going down and this event doesn't produce the numbers they are looking for. They need a kick in the ass to maybe wake up.",
            "No duos AGIAIN?! WTF. Maybe I\u2019ll try back next season \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
            "As always, nothing for Ash \ud83d\ude11.\n\nJust rework her level 2 perks, do you know how situational is it to find a deathbox and the killers still being alive AND near you? Its great for pubs and terrible for ranked. The other perk is underwhelming because most of the time, i already know there is another squad near me. Give her something that actually helps her in combat.",

            "Still no duos? Been waiting for it to come back for 6 weeks and was excited to play, but guess I'll have to skip the whole season",
            "I was really hoping duos would be back :(",
            "Why THE HELL can't they leave duos alone?\u00a0\n\n\nHoly shit does that make me angry. It's the ONLY mode I enjoy, playing with a buddy.\u00a0\n\n\nWaited all season for it to end just to find out we're getting quads.\n\n\nSeriously, this is f**king annoying.",
            "Don\u2019t even bother with this ranked rumble shit if you\u2019re on console. The whole leaderboards will be dominated by teamers the same way it will be dominated by rage hackers on PC.",
            "So now we have solos, trios, and quads. No duos, still. \n\nMakes no sense. Sometimes I only have 1 friend online to play with. Why are you doing this respawn",
            "Lifeline's prestige skin looks more like Caustic than Caustic's prestige skin lmfao. I know that's the point of the event, but seriously? I was really looking forward to a good prestige skin for Lifeline.\n\nAlso, the nerfs to Bang and Blood seem like such a desperate attempt to squelch the Bang/Blood meta in ALGS. I get watching every single team play Bang/Blood is boring, but damn, y'all are killing two legends for the sake of pro play.",
            "Man keep duos! Quads and solo is cool but make it LTM or add them to it. Me and my friend wanted to play together this season without randos but we CANT.\n\nThis is so dumb.",

            "How out of touch can a dev team possibly be with a playerbase. Not bringing Duo\u2019s back???",
            "I\u2019ve completed every batttlepass since release and this will be the first I miss since duos was taken out. Maybe it\u2019s for the best. RIP DUOS",
            "NOBODY ASKED YOU TO REMOVE DUOS\nNOBODY ASKED YOU TO REMOVE DUOS\nNOBODY ASKED YOU TO REMOVE DUOS!!!\n\nAbsolutely no one is going to play quads after 2 weeks but here we are!\n\nThere was even a happy medium of pubs duos and quads with ranked trios but nooooo let's screw over duos again!",
            "Why can't these fucks have solos, duos, trios, and quads going at the same time. Definitely not redownloading this",
            "Well there is no duos so I will continue to not play I guess. This is by and far my least played season because of the duos removal. Really hope they bring it back next season",
            "no cheater updates at all. At least tell us we are working on implementing a new ban system or have banned x amount this season. nothing.",

            "I have never been more disappointed in patch notes for any game. No duos for an entire season ? Wtf",
            "No Duos, worthless havoc nerf, No mention of SBMM, No Aim assist nerf... Just another useless cash grab for sub par cosmetics with even worse color schemes.... Atleast OW has a new season we can all go play instead.",

            "If they're going to nerf bloodhound again at least give them a skin",
            "damn they can't let World's Edge go from rotation huh",
            "The only thing I'm excited about is quads. Honestly, it should just replace trios at this point.",
            "A freaking W lets goooooooooooooooo.\nBang Blood dead, thank you Jesus !",
            "Buffing the G7 because its been \"under performing\" seems wild to me. Arguably the best marksman gun even pre these buffs, definitely the best in category now.",
            "Aaaaaand still won\u2019t be playing it because you refuse to bring duos back. \u201cLet\u2019s make them add yet ANOTHER random to their squad, because they loved being forced into trios\u201d",
            "I wish all scan abilities were reworked. Blood scans, seer scans, leave crypto alone. I know that can't happen bc it fundamentally changes legends but scanning can't ever be balanced.",
            "When is Valks jetpack recharge going to be fixed? It still takes forever to recharge after using, and jumping, mantling of falling pauses it and restarts the time delay for the charging.",
            "Fixed bug that caused high polling rate mice to occasionally encounter high frame stutters. High polling rate mice users should now see little to no frame stutters from mouse input.\n\n* Input and window processing now occurs on its own thread instead of the render thread\n* So this game does have a input delay bug on mouse and keyboard I thought I was losing my mind.",
            "I like these patch changes overall, but idk I'm really REALLY confused on the Bang nerf.\nLike yh I understand that her and bloodhound were a problem TOGETHER but you've removed bloodhounds Ability to scan in smokes too(and digital threats entirely aswell)\u00a0\nBut now you've given enemies the ability...to fight and see other players in smoke...which defeates the whole purpose of the smoke concealing you and your squad.\u00a0\nSo now using smokes provides little advantage, cause if you use it on your team...it won't help you cause enemies with a 20m radius can see you. And so it only conceals at kid to long range which is fine...but most good players can get cover or avoid shots from those ranges\u00a0\nIdk I feel like this is gonna have far more of a negative impact on bang overall than they intended\u00a0",
            "How has Rev Ult still not gotten nerfed? It's the most low risk high reward crutch ability in the game",
            "I really wish I could get a refund for this seasons battle pass, or that it could be applied to the next season. Because they removed duos, I not been able to play, so I just threw away the money I spent on it.",
            "So happy about bang smoke changes. Won't be completely blinded by panicking players who smoke and gtfo. Also competitive would be worth watching",
            "I ask again, swap the right side of Loba's upgrades. 25% range is great for late game while 3 items is great for early game. 3 items on purple makes no sense and simply means I will always pick shorter cd on tactical.",
            "Why should Bang even have smoke at this point? They give legends abilities and then become determined to make you use it less(e.g. bang smoke, caustic gas, etc) but have no problem with all the weird physics defying mOveMeNt mechanics in the game.",
            "G7 BUFFF LEEEETSSS GOOOO that's what I've been waiting for! \n\nThe hound nerfs gonna hurt ngl,  no smoke see through I understand but no more ult extend or heal on ult massive, I guess 50% reduction on tac is nice but the ult is completely gutted.  \n\nBang change was a long time coming honestly, I still think bang Should be fairly dominant however.",

I asked if the Octane rushed me. He said no. He just stayed in the same spot and that shot randomly went through the box, though it looked odd that he kept shooting at me in the first place.

If you're both inside the smoke, both of you will have comparable vision. This hopefully eliminates some of the visual bugs that happen with smokes at certain angles or when entering/exiting the smoke.\n\nThis doesn't change most interactions that enemies will have outside of your smoke. The only interaction that will be worth noticing is if the enemy uses another smoke to see through their smoke into your smoke. Which would admittedly be super weird. If you want to revive close to enemies. Choose to either smoke your feet and hope they don't push into it, as usually. Or, smoke yourself outside the smoke.\n\nOutside of that, smokes are going to play almost the same. Just think of it like Valorant smokes, or your own personal team vs team mini arena.",

There's far too many legend designs that are so so heavily favored by their abilities (lookin' at you valk) that you can't neuter some folk like Bloodhound and still have healthy balance overall. \n\nUltimately the issue they're trying to avoid looking at is the balance between inputs (controller/mnk) and the issues with Auto-Aim. Bang smoke is used particularly because of the AA. SMG nerfs were done in part because of the AA. They're changing a lot of the fundamentals of this game to cater to a design decision that should've been walked back seasons ago.

Like rev sucks in comp, but has a super high pick rate in pubs and ranked.\n\nPlus their role has been slowly overshadowed. You used to practically require a skirmisher to get around and avoid ring and gatekeeping (see: valk's historical dominance), but now everyone has pocket balloons for that. Additionally assaults just offer a lot of utility now as hybrids. Bang's a hybrid support/rotator, ash has a rotation ability, fuse has scanning and ring consoles, and maggie and ballistic have teamwide mobility. The need for skirmisher ults is greatly diminished and that's all they really provide aside from raw fragging potential.",

The havoc spun up has comparable DPS to the bullet hose SMG, but with significantly more range and uptime. By every metric it's an SMG with assault rifle range and mag size, which is pretty stupid",
            "Honestly, yeah. My wife and I play together and loved duos. We can either play trips or ranked. Trios we get a teammate that hot drops only (not our play style) and leaves the millisecond they are downed, basically making it no fill. Why would we want to play 2v3 on purpose every single fight? Either that, or we play ranked, where I\u2019m almost Diamond and every lobby is insane, people don\u2019t miss a single shot, people are shooting through smoke like it doesn\u2019t exist, etc.",
            "Yeah I've played enough of this game at this point.  Been playing since season 4 I think.  I used to play with randoms for the first 10 seasons or so but I've tapered off from it.  The game is still fun but I'm not addicted to it like I was in the beginning, so really it's just a fun way for me to hang out with good friends who I don't get to see irl as much as I'd like.  Playing with my friends is just such a better experience at this point that I don't have any desire to play solo.",

            "That\u2019s not the point I was making. I didn\u2019t say I couldn\u2019t tell which mirage is the real one. I said he adds the most visual clutter to the game. They reduced muzzle flash for this same reason. Too much going on on screen.",
            "Of course those aren\u2019t exact numbers. But let\u2019s not pretend they\u2019re changing bang/blood because of casuals. It is strictly due to ALGS and how the pros have the Respawn team on speed dial.",
            "Yeah quite possibly.",
            "Yes but in most other shooters, everyone has access to smokes. Giving that option to only one character is the reason everything is getting imbalanced.",
            "Yeah but as you said,it's a must have,so having it tied to one character force everyone to play this character even if it's stats are terrible. They need to find a way around it which is not making scans useless",

            "I tried it for the first time the season before they removed double tap. Was killing people in .1 seconds. Had never really bothered with it in thousands of hours of apex but I realized what I missed out on. Same way I abused double tap EVA after finding out how broken it was on Winter Express and then they took it out 2 seasons later.",
            "HAVOC has more DPS and higher damage per mag than the Flatline, R99 and R301 for YEARS. It had more range and uptime than R99 for YEARS, only when R99 had 12 damage per shot, R99's DPS was just a little higher than HAVOC. \n\nSo HAVOC would have been stupid strong for years, but today is the day we decide it needs more nerfs. DPS is part of its strength, so is its mag size. -4 is already a reasonable start. It decreases the braindead spray and pray one-clip chances, it hurts its hipfire reliability. Time will tell if it's enough. \n\nLastly, let's not forget without Turbo, there is a spin up delay on HAVOC. In tight situations, that delay can be fatal. \n\nHOWEVER! I agree. HAVOC needs more nerfs, keep it coming, lower it to 28 mag size please. Also, lower its fire rate or DPS, remove its spin up delay to compensate even. Remove its relevance in the game, let my LSTAR shine. Thanks in advance, Respawn.",
            "I can understand not wanting to hot drop.  \n\nPersonally though I don\u2019t mind 2v3. Me and my buddy use it as training sometimes.  Our biggest issue is forgetting it isn\u2019t duos and being surprised they have a 3rd member lol.",
            "Nah I don\u2019t really play solo either, I just meant you\u2019d rather not play at all than to play you + buddy + random in trios?\n\nI mostly run with a duo, and our 3rd is whenever one of our other friends are available (3ish person rotation), but it\u2019s often just us 2.  We vibe out similarly but I would rather us and a random than for us to not play at all.",
            "Look at last year and the year before then, we bottomed out at around the same amount at least once per year. Usually happens earlier in the year, but this year its been seemingly pushed back due to a popularity surge at the end of last year. \n\nPeople like to call this game dead or dying but in reality it has proven capable to bounce back bigger and bigger each time, unless it starts dropping below 200k there isn't really any proof that the game is seriously losing players.",
            "I mean, look at the steam charts the evidence is right there. (It's also kinda funny since it also shows that this past year has been the game's most successful one yet in terms of player count)",

            "what's 911, i'm in europe.\n\nnot having one of the modes in the game for a few weeks or months, doesn't mean you can't play. the other thing they mentioned is way more extreme of an example, a terribly bad comparison. it's a strawman argument. i can't believe you buy into that argument.",

            "I mean really what I want a nerf is the brain dead aim assist hipfire gameplay which has completely infested the meta. It's why the havoc is a high DPS smg that out competes everything, it's why smgs have been nerfed so much making the havoc even harder to compete against, and it's why bang is a huge deal despite being previously considered balanced. But I'll take some havoc nerfs too. The hipfire spread needs to be hard nerfed, keeping it as a mid ranged gun so people have to actually use as an assault rifle and where the recoil and spin up it's balanced around actually become a factor. That's not even that harsh a nerf, they did the same shit to the 301 back when it was a psuedo smg, everyone bitched and moaned about it and said \"but it's been like this for years\", and guess what it was fine and people stopped using 301 every game while hypocritically claiming it was balanced.",
            "I don\u2019t mind either typically, but I don\u2019t know about you, the MM is absolutely fucking cranked and almost every single squad we fight is rocking 4k/20 bomb badges and triple stacked. Like almost every single squad, so it\u2019s not exactly a fun experience lol.",
            "I'm in the same boat as the dude. Anytime we play with a random, 95% of the time they're trash. Just, not following basic tactics trash. It just isn't fun when your roll the dice for if you have fun or not.  After 17 seasons, yeah, Id rather play fewer but good sessions than more but mediocre ones.",
            "I'm not saying it's dying, it's just stupid that they killed off duos and that's likely where the missing players are.  They could just skip this dumb Quads shit that no one cares about and bounce back right away instead of next season.",
            "Am I somehow comparing two situations where Respawn forces people to choose between either not playing the game, or playing in a way they don't want to? Yes.",
            "911 is the number for emergency response in the U.S., but since you're from Europe, you're likely more familiar with 112. Other countries and regions use different numbers, like 999 in the UK, 000 in Australia, 111 in New Zealand, and 119 in South Korea.\n\nYou're right that I can still play Apex Legends, as there are modes like Trio, Mixtape, Solo (which will soon be replaced by Quads for the rest of the season), Ranked, and occasionally Limited Time Modes (LTM). However, when I say \u201cI can\u2019t play,\u201d I don\u2019t mean I literally can\u2019t play. I'm expressing my frustration that the mode I play the vast majority of the time, Duos, will be unavailable for the rest of this season, and I\u2019m quite upset about it.\n\nI simply don\u2019t enjoy the other modes. I don't like playing with random players, which I don\u2019t think will improve with Quads, as that will involve two random players. I could play Trios with a friend and use the no-fill option, but then we would be up against teams of three. While being the underdogs could be fun, I don\u2019t find it enjoyable in the long run.\n\nMy preferred mode is Duos because I rarely have more than one friend online at the same time due to geographical differences and time zones. Most of the time, it's just me and one other friend able to play together. Time zones aren\u2019t the only issue; other factors include work conflicts, family time, household chores, etc. This affects not just me but my friends as well.\n\nWhile I could find others to play with, it takes time to find someone with a matching schedule, chemistry, skill level, and other factors that work for both me and my friend or other teammates so we can play Trios or Quads.\n\nThese are the reasons I say \u201cI can\u2019t play.\u201d The amount of time I can play and enjoy the game is drastically reduced due to Duos being unavailable until the next season, which also makes me regret buying the season pass.",

One of our good buddies we used to play a lot with is on PS4 and every time he comes to our lobbies he complains about how much harder it is, ranked and pubs.

Time your med kits when you take 4 ticks of damage (round 4 only, round 5 is hard to time your heals).Just go through ring from said rail station then go north then go for the crossroads of Alpha base/apartments of alpha base. The intersection has cover (rocks and the jump pad railing).\n\nHope this helps.",

I still remember arguing with my friends how we should've just sticked to the other side when we had the chance. The second time I was the last one alive and people chasing me got deleted with me. Only after I started avoiding that area completely and had better luck where I won once and got 2nd twice in that exact ring.",
