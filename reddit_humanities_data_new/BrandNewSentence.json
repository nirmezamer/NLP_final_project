We get about one person show interest per month at best and I just felt like maybe reposting would help us find more people.\n\nNone of us exactly like how some things are handled on this subreddit, so you can use the comment section for your complaints. I would gladly take criticism on what to improve if such criticism is provided. However, expect most of them to be ignored if you have no solution in mind, or harass others for no reason. Remember we are people with lives outside of internet so stuff like this report just upsets more than anything. We can't check thousands of posts that get posted weekly, especially when most of us don't have time to go on reddit daily.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xm8c1xxfp9xc1.png?width=244&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3902aef7d25c1b845d1c660be649f353f92cb4b\n\nIf you are interested in applying, send me a DM with the following (I'm not doing a google doc this time since everyone forgets to check it)\n\n* Your discord name (required for communication, none of us use reddit chat. It's not the greatest way to communicate)\n* Why are you interested in modding this subreddit? Where did you find this post?\n* Are there any rules that you'd change? If so, why? If not, say \"No\"\n* Which problems you aim to fix by being a mod & any suggestions on how you or we could fix them\n* What is some content you would remove from the subreddit? Ex. check the \"hot\" or \"new\" tabs and link an example. Explain why it is bad for the subreddit\n* What is some content you would like to see more on the subreddit? Link an example, maybe a favorite post of yours and explain why it fits the subreddit (if you can)\n* Do you agree with rule 9? Elaborate.\n\nIf you don't know English or are a powermod, do not apply. I think both are self explanatory for a witty text based subreddit\n\nHope everyone has a great day :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Society places into us all sorts of cravings about what we must have or be, and we hyperfocus on our unfulfilled needs that manifest themselves stronger than enjoyment, and as a result lose the ability to enjoy actual process of living.

On the layman level, which is what we are, this research matters only as a source for actual tactics in therapy, something that informs professionals that interact with patients. Narrow data is not a solution, the interpretation and conclusions and practices are\n\nMeanwhile, cherry picked research and lopsided non representative data sets can be used by propagandists to abuse our insecurities and our narrow focus to promote their agenda as if that's solution, and us having the blinders on and not seeing the larger forest makes their agenda feel right\n\nYou already fell for it and took it literally and started burrowing into what it wanted you to burrow into, while for me it made that general point and wasn't even connected to the specific situation that they wanted me to feel insecure about.

None of the food on the plates is identifiable, just vague shapes. The biggest clue it\u2019s ai for me tho is in panel 1 where her hair just fades into the pillow on the left.

Here, it didn't work, and the human who published it didn't bother to filter the AI output to select parts that work, to essentially use AI as a source of meaningful human made collage with that underlying consistency\u00a0",
            "Honestly the biggest clue is that the backgrounds match the text, except in the fourth panel where they\u2019re just in a slightly different restaurant.\n\nThat\u2019s not a mistake a human artist would ever make.",

            "This isn\u2019t true unless you\u2019re listening to a baroque orchestra. In modern orchestras, most players use synthetic strings as they\u2019re a lot more stable and project better.",
            "Your strings were some combination of nylon, silk, steel, and/or nickel. Real gut strings are expensive and fragile, so were not used for student instruments once alternatives were available.",
            "Catgut actually has nothing to do with cats, so no worries about people having killed cats to use their intestines. Catgut was made from animal intestine, yes, but at least it was animals that the entirety would end up being used for food and materials. So their deaths weren\u2019t wasteful.",
            "Why? Cars hit a bunch of cats, will you throw up upon seeing a car?",
            "What a stupid thing to say. What is it with reddit and its hate for people that cause no harm to them nor animals?",
            "Damn those vegans and their \\*checks notes\\* no desire to cause direct harm to animals.",

            "Vegans usually don't eat honey, even though bees are awesome and aren't harmed in the process.\n\nI really do my best to understand the ethics about non humans animal suffering, and I adapt my diet accordingly (I just like meat and my omega 3 from fish too much to go vegan...), but honey? Come on.\n\nIt's a mutually beneficial interaction for bees, humans and the flora. It deserves a pass imo.",
            "The reason they need to be sheared to be healthy is because humans have selectively bred them to produce so much wool that it negatively affects their health.",
            "I didn\u2019t forget because I didn\u2019t know lol. Now I do. I\u2019ll need to get the bow repaired, I would like to experiment randomly with it in my office when I feel burnout",

            "Because I played an instrument that I thought was partly MADE OF cat guts. As in, part of the cat was there, being strung and used by my hands. The cars that hit cats (in most cases) don't do it on purpose, it's not part of what makes a car a car. But to answer your question, yeah, if I see a dead cat smeared on the front or tires of a car, chances are I'd throw up.",
            "What you eat is none of my concern. Vegans are like religious people, imposing their views under a misplaced sense of superiority.",
            "I know someone who started breeding horses for their meat just because they met a French person who was interested in buying it and reselling it back home.",
            "Fries? You mean that thing we dip into fermented egg sauce?",
            "Honey is an animal product that could theoretically be obtained ethically, but common practices in industrial honey production include:\n\n\n* replacing the honey with a sugar substitute which is less healthy for the bees\n\n\n* selective breeding to increase productivity, leading to more susceptibility to disease. \n\n\n* clipping the queen\u2019s wings\n\n\n* accidental harming of bees when obtaining the honey\n\nThe point is that a business will always prioritise profit over the wellbeing of the animals. But like I said, honey is one of the few animal products where I could imagine an ethical production; but you certainly won\u2019t find that in the honey at the supermarket.",
            "Also, bees are literally free to leave at any time. It\u2019s not like there are gates around them - and they are known to leave shitty beekeepers.",
            "Bee vomit should be vegan kosher",
            "It is not mutually beneficial. European honey bees which are used for honey production are really good at collecting nectar and terrible at spreading pollin. When they're imported to an area they're not native to, they endanger the local pollinators (bees, butterflies and humming birds) and they destroy local flora.\n\nHoney production upsets the ecological balance. Animal exploitation is not a form of conservation. There's far too much conflict of interest for bee keepers to actually give a shit. The same applies to any hunter you hear claiming to be a \"conservationist\". It's bullshit and you fell for it.",
            "Depends on the vegan. My aunt is pretty heavily into vegan culture and she will use honey occasionally, she doesn't like the taste though. She will also wear wool because as said above it is often a painless and necessary process.",
            "Just wait until vegans find out about figs",
            "The problem with bees is more that honey bees are an invasive species. They drive away other pollinators that are extremely important for the ecosystem! The more honey bees there are the smaller the diversity in wild pollinators is, which is terrible for nature. Some of these wild pollinators are crucial for pollinating certain plants that honey bees are not pollinating. With honey bees around the diversity in plants is going down.\n\n\nBee keeping is in fact not helping \"the bees\", its endangering a lot of wild species.",
            "Add cheese to that too. \u0130ts made from milk no animal is suffering from it.",
            "Yep! My point was that vegans avoid animal products overall, not just in cases where the animal is killed (meat, leather).",
            "Only if they're not regularly sheered. Ideally, it's a symbiotic relationship where they provide wool, we provide food, shelter, and protection.\n\nDon't get me started on factory farms twisting that equation, because fuck factory farms.",
            "That's the way! I can see it working actually, fight off your own impending burnout by basically insta-burning anyone nearby",

            "Can't you really see the irony in your behaviour?",
            "Oh yeah, don't get me wrong, I don't excpect ethical supplies from supermarkets. Even non animal products. A lot of that stuff is grown thanks to toxic agricultural products. \n\nI mentioned honey because, if done right, it can be cruelty free AND have a postive impact for the environment. Also,, I like bees. They are so cute.",
            "Isn\u2019t the same ethical production an issue with vegetables at large scale? Such as pesticides killing bees, overuse of fertilizer polluting groundwater, shitty working conditions for farmers. \n\nLast time I heard, corn is not a environmentally friendly crop. Not to mention it being used as cattle feed and HFCS being put in most US food products. \n\nIndustrial food production is a crapfest.",
            "Similar to caged eggs and free range eggs, there\u2019s the opportunity for legislation to dictate the standards necessary to be called (insert new term here). Then only those that routinely meet those standards can call their honey (that same term).",
            "Businesses *over a certain size* will. Especially when they're publicly traded.\n\nI'm not vegan, but I do buy my honey from local bee-keepers, and my meat and dairy from a coop of local family farms that treat the animals far better than corporate factory farms would. It's more expensive, but while I'm willing to kill and eat an animal I draw the line at torturing them first.",
            "They endanger wild pollinators, thats the biggest problem with the massive increase of honey bee populations. They have a terrible impact on the enviroment",
            "That one really took me by surprise tbh. Even being omnivorous, I haven't been able to est a fig since.",
            "What about figs?",
            "Uuhhhh. . . You may wanna look into industrial dairy farm practices. . . Dairy was sorta one of the reasons the divide between vegetarian and vegan exists cause shits a little fucked . . .",
            "Dairy is one of the most cruel and disturbing industries lol. Go watch some videos of dairy farms in action and look into how they deal with blood and pus in the milk (hint: they don't, it stays)",
            "You know that cows don't just give milk all the time? They are artificially inseminated and their newborn calfs are taken away immediately after birth. The females are raised to be milking cows themselves and the males are slaughtered as soon as economically viable. Cows, like any mammal, have motherly instincts and will cry for their children. This cycle is repeated until the milking cow is too old or ill to give birth and milk at the pace the farmers require to make money. Then she's killed as well, usually long before her natural time. \"NO animal is suffering\" \n\nYeah, cheese is fucking awesome. It's the last thing I let go. But I just can't anymore after seeing where it comes from.",
            "Dude dairy is up there with veel as some of the worst of the worst in terms of how we treat animals.",
            ">Ideally, it's a symbiotic relationship where they provide wool, we provide food, shelter, and protection.\n\nDon't forget the murder aspect. People don't look after their slaves once their production rate slows down.",

            "Need more of them then lol",
            "Oh man that's heavy for a comment on Reddit. Dude let it go",
            "Yeah we got some bee farmers around here that are small scale and everyone kinda loves em. Their bees pollinate crops, and in turn we all get delicious local honey where each one is different based on where the bees are and what\u2019s around em. Only downside is I have to rescue lost bees from gettin stuck inside the barn windows lmao.",
            "Honey bees have a terrible(!) impact on the enviroment as they are the cause of eradication of wild pollinators that are extremly important for a healthy ecosystem",
            "I feel like it's crucially important to specify that because it's the difference between environmental preservation and environmental carnage.\n\nAnother example of this would be farmed bivalves versus wild bivalves. Farmed bivalves consume all the pollutants in the ocean and clean it up. Wild Bivalves are terrible because they're harvested by dredging the ocean floor. If I went around saying bivalves were good for the environment and vegans are dumb for not eating them, I'd be wrong unless I specifically specified bivalves in areas like the EU where you can be sure that they were farmed and not dredged.",
            "It's only a specific species of fig. You're probably fine.",
            "There's wasps in the figs",
            "Fair enough, and very considerate, but I wouldn't worry bout the cats. Those guys have appalling taste. They probably vibing to that shit. No doubt sounds literally like an alley cat love song to them. Cats.\n\nMeanwhile, back in my head canon, you're still giving everyone rapid-action burnout.",
            "Again, not a single vegan is doing anything here. Just you parroting against them.\n\nCheers.",
            "Sadly they are endangering wild pollinators and drive them away from their territory. Which in turn is harming biodiversity and the enviroment",
