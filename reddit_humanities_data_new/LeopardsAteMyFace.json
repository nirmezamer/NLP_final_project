        "content": "Recently, we noticed an increased amount of nonsensical explanatory comments with no relation in any way, shape or form to the theme of this subreddit.\n\nThe \"_leopards ate my face_\" theme is embodied by this quote in the sidebar.\n\n> \"_I never thought leopards would eat **my** face_\", sobs woman who voted for the _Leopards Eating People's Faces Party_. Revel in the schadenfreude anytime someone has a sad because they're suffering consequences from something they voted for, supported or wanted to impose on other people.\n\nThis statement made out of 3 parts.\n\n1. **Someone** voted for, supported or wanted to impose **something** on **other people**.\n2. **Something** has the consequences of **consequences**.\n3. As a consequence of **something**, **consequences** happened to **someone**.\n\nIn your explanatory comment, answer these 3 elements and include the minimum amount of information necessary so your post can be understood by everyone, even if they don't live in the US or speak English as their native language. If you fail to identify them, it will be difficult for a moderator to understand if this post fits and it will probably be removed. If you complain about it, we'll just send you back [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/lt8zlq).\n\nThe explanatory comment is not the place to write a pretty poem nor is it the place to promote books. Copying this post, copying large parts of the article and nonsensical comments will get your post removed under rule #3. Keep it stupid simple.\n\nTo help you get started, here's an example.\n\n1. Helen, Roberto Beristain's wife, voted for Donald Trump, who vowed to impose deportation to illegal immigrants such as her husband.\n2. Voting for Trump, who vowed to deport illegal immigrants such as Roberto Beristain, has the consequence of having illegal immigrants deported and families separated.\n3. As a consequence of voting for Trump, Roberto Beristain got deported and Helen's family was separated.\n\nYou should absolutely make sure that it is easy to match your explanatory comment with the provided format or your post will be mercilessly removed. If, however, you can't match your explanatory comment with the format, then you should just delete your post and save us the effort.",

They support a policy which obviously screws over a group of people but the person supports it without any regard for the possibility that it will affect him or his loved ones. \n\nHere are some examples:\n\n* Bob is a rich guy who supported cutting public aid to the downtrodden because it costs him taxpayer money. Bob later found himself going from riches to rags.\n* Sally largely blames victims for rape. She later became a victim of rape.For an inverted example, Matt thinks that due process for rapists should be eliminated. In his mind, they are guilty until proven innocent. He eventually got accused of rape.\n* As a matter of fact, this includes any time a law a politician helped to pass which is later used to prosecute them.\n* Sam thinks that businesses should be able to serve whomever they want. His son, who's gay, was denied treatment at a hospital because he's gay, leading to his death.\n* John opposed federal aid to areas which had gone through a disaster. John's hometown got ravaged by a tornado.\n* Dale is an affluent person and is a staunch democrat who believes that the government should do more to help the downtrodden. He was surprised to learn that when the democrats took office, his taxes went up.\n* Alice supported tariffs because she supports \"buying American\". After tariffs get passed, Alice noticed that goods cost more.\n* Josh works a low wage job and wanted to increase the minimum wage. Josh was well aware that the increase would cost some jobs but didn't think that he would be affected. As it turned out, he got laid off.\n\nNot examples:\n\n* Bob, a rich guy, supports policies which screw over the lower and middle classes only to find that nobody likes him.\n* Sally is a conservative who got cancelled for her views.\n* Dale is another rich guy who votes democrat. He doesn't like high taxes but supports them for being pro LGBT.\n* Josh didn't work hard and got fired.",

            "After looking at the flowchart, and reviewing a *number* of topics in this very subreddit, it seems that many users continue to misunderstand the intended goal of this subreddit, or perhaps (as these topics are upvoted in the thousands anyway), it would be wise to expand the definition of what this sub represents.\n\nYes, the sub specifically sets out to emulate the example laid down by one specific tweet, but the banner clearly states the *goal* is **Schadenfreude.**  This can be experienced in a variety of ways, and although there are many subs that are designed to deliver Schadenfreude as well, I still think there is a place for many of these aforementioned posts in this space, if may I suggest another form of \"consequences?\"\n\nIn America (and typically worldwide), Politicians *rarely* face the consequences of their own actions, save for being called out on social media / in the media. Very, very few ever go to jail or actually suffer consequences beyond a blow to their reputation. Nevertheless, seeing politicians being called out for taking the opposite on stances they previously held, or looking to have egg on their face (basically every topic about the Roe V Wade leak) does offer us as humans Schadenfreude; hell, according to a Harvard study, [we hate hypocrites more than liars](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jillianjordan/files/why_do_we_hate_hypocrites_-_evidence_for_a_theory_of_false_signaling.pdf).\n\nThis is my suggested change: ***Allow Politicians being \"called out\" on social media / in the media to count as the \"consequence of their actions\" clause of the LAMF flowchart.*** Indeed, some of the [top](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/skpi8m/mike_pence_breaks_with_trump_president_trump_is/) [voted](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/rku9ih/trumps_supporters_booed_and_jeered_when_he/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/of4l17/illegal_aliens_suck_except_when_its_my_family/) [over](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/oxrwh7/qanon_followers_are_now_accusing_evangelical/) [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/oo19tv/and_the_award_for_most_hypocritical_douchebag_of/) [last](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/rtb2he/mtg_gets_attacked_by_qanon_folk_for_owning_pharma/) [year](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/ucsjpb/desantis_gets_a_taste_of_his_own_medicine/) [were](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/ugqqkj/gay_conservative_commenter_says_hes_getting_a/) [exactly](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/rsb1oz/alex_jones_threatens_to_dish_dirt_on_trump_for/) these types of [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/o6a4y6/trans_news_presenter_surprised_to_find_her_new/). I think we all understand that being called out is *barely* a consequence for your actions, but that's about all the recourse we have these days against politicians.  \n\n\nEvery once in a while, a politician(s) actually maneuvers themselves into a place where they [actually are LAMF](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/se2q8c/republicans_wont_be_able_to_filibuster_bidens/) (as I understand it to be now), but you'll be waiting a while between posts for the next time a politician actually faces any consequences.\r  \n\r  \nHalf the Content on this sub was laughing at Covidiots who died / suffered from not getting vaxxed.

            "(tldr at bottom)\n\nOne thing that's kinda sad here sometimes is when whole regions are grouped together as though all the people voted for the party that screwed them over. Even in area that is 60/40 voters in favor of one party, there are still 40% (and maybe more, if you include those who didn't vote) who are against said party. \n\nFor example, there was a train derailment and environmental disaster that is endangering people in Ohio. I see a lot of posts kind of implying that Ohioans are surprised to be getting what they deserve, but those posts apply to like \\_\\_everyone in rural Ohio\\_\\_, as though they all supported what caused the thing harming their communities/families. It really adds insult to injury and makes the people brave enough to resist this sort of stuff invisible. \n\nTLDR: I think this sub is strongest when posts don't consist of the low hanging fruit of \"people in this region tended to vote for this party, and look, tragedy struck bc of deregulation and they all got what they deserved!\"   Would there be a way to add to the guidelines that posts should be about -specific- people or groups?

They made this bed.\n\n**Edit:** looks like the Rittenhouse-defender-munchkins have entered the thread.\n\nNot sure why it's such a difficult concept for some, but just because you *can* be somewhere, and are *allowed to* be somewhere, doesn't mean you *need to* be somewhere, or indeed have any business being there, particularly if what you are planning to do is 100% geared on making the situation worse and more dangerous all around.\n\nIf you need to have it explained to you what the difference is between someone who protests for whatever reason, and someone who a) specifically gets guns to b) specifically drive to a protest where he doesn't care about supporting either side, but just wants to c) be able to murder people by d) claiming \"self-defense\" when he went in as an aggressor, then you aren't the kind of person who is actually willing to understand the difference anyway. \n\nSame goes for the difference between the latter person and those who turn regular protests into violent ones because they enjoy chaos and violence \u2013 I don't condone that in the slightest, but between that and the mindset of using such protests as your personal shooting range that enables you to use living people as your targets is still a world of difference. \n\nIf someone specifically goes somewhere only to have an opportunity to \"self-defend\" and also sets everything up to do so in as lethal a way as possible (and to also do it in a way where he is not likely to actually get close enough to any person to actually need to defend himself from anything, though that is just an additional thing) then that person is a murderer. \n\nThat US laws are so screwed up around gun use and the definition of self-defense that that person can get away with doing the above may mean he can murder without seeing real punishment, but it's murder all the same.\n\nAs a side note, I'm also curious if all the people jumping in to defend him would also be happy to have Rittenhouse as their neighbour, and how comfortable they'd find the idea of him getting cross with them over something. But since it was \"just self-defense\" what he did, I'm sure it wouldn't be at all unsettling to have someone with a mind and emotional capacity like his right there next to you and all your loved ones, including pets. \n\nIf you find you would mind having him there, ask yourself how that works with seeing him justified in his actions and worthy of release. Maybe you'll be able to appreciate that something that is defensible by (US) law can still be morally abhorrent, and leave someone to go free without being innocent at all.",
