A community moderator here in the Notion subreddit.\n\nI have recently been given the privilege & responsibility of stewarding this community for the foreseeable future. In this introductory video, I wanted to share a few words about what you can expect, along with a healthy encouragement for you all to share your feedback here on this post.\n\n***What to Expect:***\n\n* Reasonable consideration on your feedback about how r/Notion can improve\n* Transparency on what changes or decisions we might make moving forward\n* Ideally, a renewed sense of excitement & value being shared here within our community and amongst one another.\n* NO mod interference on talks about any leaks from Notion\n   * I took it upon myself to get clarity on this, and I will take accountability for the previous discussion on Notion Calendar being hushed, but you all no longer have to worry about that from here on out. After speaking to head of Community at Notion, I can resolutely state that the Notion team had never sought to request, encourage removal of or interfere with the community talks about the platform leaks.\n   * EDIT \u2014 I have published a separate, [**Clarifying Statement about Leaks here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1c74jxp) & down below.\n\nTruly, it is my hopes that with an open ear to your feedback & a nudge in the right direction, this subreddit and the individuals within can truly reap the rewards of having such a large community to lean on.\n\n***Some ideas we can try to achieve that:***\n\n* **AMA Sessions** \u2014 to ask your top voted creators\n* **Industry Flairs** \u2014 for finding others in your niche\n   * EDIT \u2014 I started working on the draft for Industry Flairs, and [**have a question**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1ca1gxk) for you all.\n* **Opportunity Flairs** \u2014 for those open to work & those seeking it\n* **Monthly Community Contributions** \u2014 a collaborative service to help organize Notion finds for one another! (One example could be contributing to a database Full of Notion Gems & build tricks, amongst other things!)\n* **Community Polls** \u2014 for gauging feedback & gathering opinions, and thoughts on best practices\n* **Recognition** \u2014 implementing a way to better recognize community contributors & rewarding them in some way (TBD)\n\nWith that, I and my fellow Moderators are looking forward to hearing your thoughts on all of this.\n\nLet us discover together, a way to nurture genuine value & reciprocity here, while creating more avenues for us to learn, share & inspire one another.\n\nAll the Best,  \nMr. Wildenfree \ud83d\udc3a\ud83c\udf75\ud83c\udfb5  \nu/mrwildenfree  \nCommunity Mod",

            "Additional idea suggestion:\n- Some form of a open-ended roadmap\n\nThere are some people who have been using Notion and have been worried about security, or things like offline mode.\n\nHaving an understanding of whether Notion is even putting those issues on a roadmap of like (considering/technical challenging etc) would be helpful and great to many users of Notion.",

            "I like that there\u2019s some changes happening in the sub! I\u2019ve also been using Notion since 2018, and one of the things I would love to see happen in the subreddit is differentiating between self promotion/blatant selling vs people simply showing off Notion builds.\n\nI know it\u2019s a thin red line, but there definitely is a difference. The current subreddit filters has it so that only super amateur Notion builds end up staying up, while experienced builds get taken down.\n\nThis is detrimental to the community for a few reasons, but one of the biggest tragedies is all of the cool ideas from experienced Notion users getting taken down because it looks like it could be a paid template.\n\nThis sub used to be great for generating ideas and seeing what other experienced Notion users were building. But the posts that rise to the top these days are people complaining about the app.\n\nThink about that for a second - for a new user of Notion, they come to the Notion subreddit to see maybe what\u2019s possible with a little experience, and the top post is about how useless this app is without offline mode (its not btw). Not a great look for the community.\n\nThat\u2019s my 2c!",

Congratulations on your new role at Notion! \n\nIt\u2019s a great task and responsibility to undertake.\n\nI\u2019d appreciate it if you could please provide some clarification; I currently run my business using Notion and I have training materials that need to be password protected.

            "This all looks great! The direction this sub took from Notion nerds helping each other (be unproductive in our tweaking) to haters trash talking everything from Notion to how others like their dashboards was getting old.\n\nI love the idea of industry flairs. It would also be nice to have like a feature thread that changes prompts or something to show how people use Notion in their industry but also in more specific focuses, like holiday planning or parenting. We see so many vaguely broad LifeOS options but I wanna know  how you keep track of your housekeeping.\n\nI might be alone in this but I would also love a weekly thread like the showcase one but that's literally just a showcase. Not the same spam sales posts, but where people can show what they've built without being spammed for template requests and called a gatekeeper when they say they built it piece by piece and don't have a template.\n\nThe last thing on my wishlist would just be ELI5: Notion Pricing, as a FAQ or a video or something. So many people get so confused on the pricing and adding guests vs members that having a place to direct them both before signing up for paid and when they come here to claim they were scammed.",

The feed is often so choked with negative monologues that it\u2019s hard to find the posts I care about. I come to the sub to nerd out, learn a thing, or help someone else learn a thing. \n\nPerhaps there can be a \u201cNotion Feelings Thread\u201d to contain the darkness? Or just straight up not allow Notion breakup posts or rants? Most of them are because the features of Notion are not intended for the use case that person has been trying to support.

            "\u2592\u2592  \ud83d\udece\ufe0f  IMPORTANT 'LEAK' CLARIFICATION  \ud83d\udece\ufe0f  : \u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\n\nWhile I have mentioned that talking about \"**leaks**\" is fair game, I want to be clear that this is not a permission slip for those of us who are Notion Ambassadors, Champions, Consultants, Partners or even Notion Staff, to Break the [**Notion Code of Conduct**](https://notion.notion.site/Code-of-Conduct-9399b74373b94181bb1026d8afb11800) \u2014 specifically the line that states \"*Publicly sharing information explicitly intended to be private*\". This will be included in the Rule amendments to come.   \n(In an ideal world as Notion lovers, we could all be upholding the Notion Code of Conduct, but I digress).   \n  \nNevertheless, the goal of being able to talk about public leaks freely here, is to REDUCE the amount of support requests that go in to the Notion team directly. Ideally, we talk amongst ourselves, speculate & compare notes, but not presume that what we find will directly translate to a feature becoming official or available for all.   \n  \n\ud83d\udca1  It should not be used as a permission slip to bombard the Notion support lines to try & verify speculation.\n\n\ud83d\udca1  Localization & A/B Testing are legitimate contributors to the differentiation we might see amongst our unique Workspace setups. Do keep in mind that there is no guarantee that features you see in your workspace were intended for everybody, nor is it always likely a feature will be rolled out to everyone in time. Fair play to talk about though.\n\n\u274c  **It is still not permissible to share insider information that didn't have public exposure** \u2014 accidental unintended publicly exposed leaks \\[*like the Calendar details on the official website*\\] **will have to be fair play**. *Insider details that were either entrusted to us as specified members of the aforementioned groups, however, will not be permitted.*\n\n\u274c  TALKING about leaks is okay, however, if it is discovered that you are actively trying to leverage this leaked information or feature as some kind of financial gain or lead into some kind of gated access, it will very likely lead to your ban after a single warning, along with a flagging & removing of the post.\n\n\ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udffd  Obtaining insider information through other means such as some form of digital sleuthing is NOT encouraged. If this is abused and we catch wind of it, we will flag it. Further rule changes may go into effect if we notice this getting out of hand.\n\n  \nThis concludes my current clarifications on the subject of Leaks and the fair game talk. Please be mindful from here on out, and be ready to adhere to these clarifications to the rules once officially amended.\n\n\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592",

Privacy/security at the level you\u2019re speaking of, is more often than not.. a foundational, first-principle consideration. While there is a chance Notion might blindside us with an overhaul of amazingly generous security features\u2026 I am certainly not holding my breath for that. I know what it is & I willingly accept the compromise I have to make by using it.\n\nMight be strange to make another recommendation here, but if owning your own data is truly top priority for you, might I suggest Obsidian or Anytype?

We were never permitted to share insider information. That\u2019s very different from a leak.",
