I have a consistent play pattern that I'd like to break - that play pattern being, I only use one army until maybe i reach my T5 buildings, then any subsequent armies are my endgame setups. I find I do this because in the beginning hero slots tend to be in short supply, and it takes time to build up buildings. I also find it more entertaining to stick with my initial army since they'll have the better units and my lord to make battles more interesting.\n\nHowever, I know other people will have multiple armies really quickly.

So for example 19 units, 4 engineers, 1 lord means 15 units shooting with +60% damage. Something around there. Baseline I think probably 3-4 heros would be right for maxing dmg but ultimately up to you to find the balance.\n\nFor example in practice I did an ironblaster doomstack here and figured they would do the most possible DPS with 1 lord, 8 hunters and 10 cannons + healer in the army because any more heroes started to reduced my dps by more than the remaining cannons gained.

(And for Bretonnians this is good practice, you want 2 Lords accompanying every real stack to get vows done safely early.)\n\nI split them off (read: leave them behind) when I reach a border I don't want to advance further and have them start recruiting a few units to act as a border guard while recruiting another freshmeat Lord to walk around with the LL. Or if I reach say 5k+ surplus they'll also just start recruiting to let me push in another direction with a real army.",
            "I usually do it when I see the opportunity for expansion and I have a way to pay for it.

            "As soon as your economy allows.\n\nYou try to make your army comp around more \"economically efficient\" units.

Skaven early game comes to mind.  The moment my LL crosses provinces I start a second army as close to the border as possible.  With them from like turn 2-3 onwards its going to be rolling 2 armies deep (but the units are trash) until I've rebuilt my main settlement and go back to get a real army.\n\nBasically the crappier the units the earlier you do it, and having a second half stack follow your main stack to slam auto resolve is a solid tactic if your econ can fund it.\n\nIf I had to come up with a TLDR I'd say when your turn economy doubles the cost of your most expensive army you're safe to make a new one.",
            "Yeah CA have an official website, forum, and Discord.",
            "I'll keep it to my 2 main pieces of advice I give here. If you have any specific follow-up questions, feel free to ask! \n\n1) It's not save scumming, it's practicing. The best way to learn anything is to do it multiple times. On the campaign map, if you find yourself in a position where you don't fully understand what's going to happen, ctrl + S is quicksave and ctrl+L is quick load. In WH3, battles have a rematch button at the end, and in WH2 there's a quicksave button on the pre-battle screen. Especially if you really think a fight is winnable, try it a few times and test out different strategies. I'll add here that there's no shame at all in pausing to catch your breath or just playing a battle mostly in slow motion. The time manipulation is there for a reason. \n\nAlso, practice is deliberate. Pay attention to what you're changing and what is helping. Try to critically identify which units are performing really well and why. You might win a battle, but if you don't know why then you're likely to lose the next one. \n\n2) Have a plan. Winning a battle starts when you're building the army on a campaign map. To win, you need to deal more damage than you receive, so what are your damage dealers? What are theirs? Are you going to win with ranged superiority? Then you'll need a lot of ranged units and your frontline needs to be optimized for defense. How do you plan on dealing with cavalry that try to flank? What about a dragon? A siege? How will you form up? My usual mid-game dwarf army is 6 dwarf warriors/longbeards as a frontline, 2 slayers in reserve to catch flankers, 2 artillery pieces, and 6 quarrelers and 2 thunderers for damage (non-AP and AP). If I find my frontline is getting out of battles unscathed, I'll cut one or two to pack more ranged units in there. I find a good defensive spot and the artillery makes them come to me, making sure to pick off their ranged units with mine first. The main thing though is that each unit has a role that directly contributes to winning the battle. If I'm playing Archaon, I know my Chaos Warriors/Chosen are slow but unstoppable in melee, so I make sure to have good cavalry support so their ranged units and artillery don't tear me to shreds. \n\nAs a last thing, don't play on easy battle difficulty. Play on Hard and set the AI stat bonus slider to be in your favor. The auto resolve is actually way too generous when set to easy or even normal, so that's why you see close and then fight it out for a pyrrhic. I consider myself a veteran player and if the auto resolve says \"close defeat\" on Very Hard I can usually fight that out to at least a pyrrhic victory.  If I move the battle difficulty down to Easy on that same battle, it will auto resolve a close victory - better than I could do. It's purely psychological, but it sounds like it can help you.",
            "Youtube is going to be the resource I recommend in most scenarios but a few tips.\n\n1) Skirmish mode- By default many ranged units have this turned on and basically once a melee unit runs into range of them they'll run away.  Unless you know you want it on, you should always select all your units and turn off Skirmish mode.  Nothing ruins a fight faster than your damage fleeing formation right when the real fight starts.\n\n2) Control groups-Select unit(s) hold control press number.  Number now controls that set of units. When you have an elaborate tank and gun line and you need to make it move, you can click the little lock in the top right hand corner (of the number tab) and it will attempt to move that group with that relative spacing and positioning.\n\n3)Guard mode- something enters and leaves gun range and you've targeted it while it was in range but you don't want your ranged to chase them.\n\n4) Archers/Artillery vs Gunline-Simple note here. Gunline needs line of sight (up on hill or an opening in the melee frontline to fire through)  Archers and artillery fire in an arc so you can close the frontline in front of them.\n\n5) Run at them vs Defensive line.  I haven't played Chaos but it sounds like mostly a run at them army.  I apologize for the first 4 lines being about units you probably don't use but the combat style varies greatly if your army is full of melee brutes and cavalry vs ranged heavy damage. From the start of the fight you want to organize your army based on what tactics you'll be using into the battle.  You'll generally know based on what you've recruited.  If you're running Grimgor and 19 cards of Black Orcs, congratulations you're running at them.  16 cards of Lotheran Seaguard? line em up and await the charge.\n\n6)Run at them. It'll end up kinda blobby no matter what. S et your formation to have the tanky units hit  the front line and then try to get your damage-dealy ones into the back.  Cavalry you'll want to be in one or a few control groups.  You can send them out first to try to provoke the army to get out of formation, or you may need to send them far around and wait for the clash then bring them in onto the back line.  While lines clash you really need to watch for the ranged in the back that will shred your guys and work to get at them.  A ranged unit that gets collapsed on by melee will be devastated and stop being a problem real fast.\n\n7) Defensive Ranged lines-  You need spacing for guns protection on the front for all of it and a plan for enemy cavalry.  Artillery you need to check the enemy's range vs yours.  If your artillery outranges and out damages the enemy's then you'll force them to come in or get blasted for 1000 years.  Common practices for these armies is to find a corner of the map so that you can't be flanked.  If you set your line in the middle and the enemy has cavalry, they will absolutely seek to flank you and you need to have a formation/plan for it.  A few cavalry goes a long way in these lineups since in order to run at your defensive line the enemy has to travel quite a bit.  Artillery is slow and if you can get behind them you can shred cannons/catapults with your cavalry.\n\n8)Pause button and time slow.  They exist, use them often.  Managing cavalry alone is a lot of micro and on top of all the rest of your army you may need to pause and adjust.\n\nThere's like a lot of stuff, too much to really go into.  I usually build to auto resolve hard, but if I see a fight I'm gonna for sure win, but lose important units, I might fight it anyway to save them.  Those are good fights to learn (really any fight you opt into is) and practice tactics.\n\nAlso I'm a Normie gamer take all this advice for the casual advice that it is.",

            "The chorf units are, yes. The hobgoblin units, no.\n\nChorf caps are increased by paying \"armaments,\" which are a resource you can create from a specific building chain.

            "Crisis isn't what I would call a balanced end game.  It just  spawns 4ish stacks in each area (It might also increase their cap so that those stacks keep getting made, not sure)and leaves you to deal with them.  Ambush, or some really good manual resolves to preserve units, maybe kill multiple armies by rolling up reinforcement points.\n\nMake a big force and punch in. sometimes in crisis you can't protect everything and you just gotta be okay losing some stuff. But pick whatever faction is closest/smallest and when you blow through the offensive just do your best to take out any single one of them.  But crisis is just like that, you go from kicking down everyone's doors to massive fights with multiple armies a whole lot till you crush them out.",
            "Crisis armies are no pushovers, you can't just use your generic stacks to roll over them or take on 2+ stacks with your 1. If it's dwarves, you're going to need lots of armor-piercing and ways to take out their flying units and artillery. Their torpedo units will also be a major problem. For Nakai, this means you need ripperdactyl/coatl units to get on them fast and late game dinos to jump on their dangerous missile units. Magic can be a huge help to you as well.  \n\nIf you've got armies still out there conquering new territory, put a pause on that and focus on stacking up 2 or 3 armies yourself and building up a counter-army to take them on. If they're bringing 4 stacks to every battle, you're simply not going to be able to win against that much force with 2 or 3 of your own.",

Playing as Malakai, Astragoth launches an invasion with a full 20 stack against a completely unprepared border (already in wars in numerous fronts). Well, I ceded a few settlements to fall back so I could recruit the basics. Got a thane, 3 dwarven warriors, 2 miners (blasting charges) 2 quarrelers, and some grudge settlers (quarreler, slayer, grudge throwers). The last turn before he reached me, I also managed to recruit 2 gyrocopters and the skybomber RoR. His army consisted of a Frontline of tier 1-3 units, mostly t2. His back line was a mass of goblin archers. Auto resolve told me it would be a close defeat but it normally fares better than I do so I didn't feel great but wanted to try.\n\nThe battle starts and the first big swing in my favor was the terrain. I started on top of a hill at the perfect range for my grudge thrower to get some hits in. I focus down his tier 3 units pretty well before they reach my Frontline.\n\nThe second big swing was baiting his lord on a flying mount in range of my quarreler using the gyros. He charged straight after them and then got baited into combat way to early. He had died before our lines were fully engaged.\n\nThe deciding moments came at the line clash however. I didn't want to expose my copters to missile fire so I held them in reserve until the lines were engaged and the missile infantry had started exchanging fire with mine. Fortunately, they deployed their missiles in pretty much a straight line. I took the bomber, lined it up and dropped all 5 bombs on one pass of his missile line. 3/6 instantly routed. 2 of the others were wavering. I then took my missile troops to focus down their last and used the bomber and 2 gyros to fire straight into the backs of their Frontline, which was superior in both numbers and quality to mine.. Ended up being a heroic victory! Probably one of the most fun battles in recent memory. I will now be pausing all offensives to retool every army to include at least one bomber and two copters.

            "The changes they made to Gyrocopters/Gyrobombers were perfect honestly, I always keep 1 bomber(its more than enough, but can go 2 if a battle needs it) in all armies with 2 Gyrocopters(sometimes i use the trollhammer torpedoes one from the Grudge) and honestly they delete stuff easily as long as you distract the enemy units.\n\nThey are very strong but at the same time very weak if they get focused.",
            "Unpopular opinion:\n\nWhile I absolutely enjoy the Gyro changes (increased ammo, entities, engineers buffing them like crazy), I believe CA went a little too far and they are overpowered from a balancing perspective.\n\nYou get them super easily on T2, as well as Engineers who buff them to an insane level (speed, weapon strength, ammo, ammo restocks). In a Malakai campaign especially, you can have a doomstack with 3 Engineers and filled up with Gyros by turn 10, absolutely unstoppable for the AI on any difficulty, because AI can\u2018t counter them. Malakai\u2018s campaign ofc also makes this more exponential through the adventure mechanic and giving him additional recruit capacity for engineers in skill tree + an engineer as quest battle reward + gyro buffs through the first adventure you can run.\n\nIf you want easy mode campaign, there is almost no reason to recruit anything else for Dwarfs, I\u2018m sure its the same for all dwarf campaigns wven if Malakai\u2018s is \u201emost broken\u201c.",

            "Nothing like flying over enemy frontline with 15 gyrocopters and then bombing shit out of them.\n\nThey are great, saved my ass from Skarbrand raids many times.",
            "Dwarven airforce single handedly saved my ass against the College of Pyrotechnics when they spawned and attacked me a second time. (first time I beat them by reinforcing behind them and using Slayers). Turns out Hellstorms struggle to hit helicopters, grenade launcher cavalry have the \"can't hit air\" trait, and Steam tanks can (eventually) be killed.",
            "I haven't used them since ToD, but I did try gyrocopters in a few campaigns well before the dlc and my god, they were awful. I'm glad they got buffed. =)",
            "Yup, they should always fire from the side because their attack is a straight line one so firing from the side is the perfect way to deal maximum damage to the enemy units.\n\nIt's the same way you use Dragon Breath as you said.",
            "Good to know! I will make sure to do that going forward!",
            "> I believe CA went a little too far and they are overpowered from a balancing perspective\n\nYeah, same here. \n\nWhile i started a Malakai campaign, i thought \"damn, these gyros are crazy good, lemme spam them before the inevitable point where i see why that's a bad idea.\" Except that moment never came. \n\nThey are simply great units that the AI has no idea how to handle or straight up has no solution (chaos factions with poor ranged options).",
            "problem is people confuse overpowered content with good content. when CA releases power creep it makes everything else in the game worse. the new dlc feels good because everyone you fight is just weaker and has less capabilities so why play anything but the overpowered content\n\nI'm sure there will be more fun dlc but the game is cooked from a balance perspective and I doubt ca is going to update every race to get them on the level",
            "I will say I was surprised at how good they were for a tier 2, 1 turn recruitment unit. I avoid doomstacking so I can enjoy their op status without going overboard!",

In the Table top the models even had some different armor and other odds and ends. CA has simply the reused assets here. The main difference between Mournfang cav and Rhinox cav is not their riders  but thier mounts. I think the mounts themselves are visual distinct enough for clarity, but hey on that note I'd welcome some white furred mournfang too!",

Fact is, right now, the only helmeted Ogre model is Ironguts !",
            "Yes, they could. They could also use Flagellants models for Reiksknights, but why would they ?\n\nCA use a clear, simple visual guide for units tier. Ironguts > Bulls, then Ironguts cavalry > Bull cavalry. The point is, the only Ogre models with those helmets are Ironguts, and they are armored to match, both visually and stats-wise.\n\nSo if you pop them on Mournfangs, then you need to give the unit Ironguts stats.",
            "Yeah, ogres were one of the factions where the model did a bad job showing their armour value back in TT. \n\nI guess the Rhinox Cavalry being older models also had to do with it too since it predates 8th edition armybook by a few years.",
