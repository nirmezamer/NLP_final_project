            "Even when he's a vampire, Wong will do everything in his power to save and protect his best friend. \n\nAnd when in doubt, go to Baron Mordo.",
            "This was a great tie in issue, fun to focus on Wong",
            "Poor Wong, man. He is in a no-win scenario where he CAN beat Victor in Stephen's body but doing so would mean literally killing Stephen's body again. And they don't want to go through a Death of Strange again.\n\nI am confused about Blade showing up in the crypt THAT early though. Victor's plot to escape was happening with the halloween stories each year, long before this event. Are they saying Blade was possessed for a long time now? Because I thought it happened during and after Adana stuff in the recent book where he embraced his darker side and that allowed him to be possessed by whatever ancient Vampire that has been around since old Atlantis. Maybe it is to hide the real form of the villain and that Blade panel is the most recent one? But even that, Victor escaped before Blade was dealing with Adana.\n\nI dunno, it is weird and gonna need answers for all that.\n\nFinally though we gonna have Bats teaming up with the snakes and MORDO of all people to escape the Crypt and save the day. If Mordo does save the day, Strange will NEVER hear the end of that. More realistically, Mordo will try to kill Victor in Stephen's body but Wong will work to prevent it.",
            "Soo Buri/Tiwaz definitely knew that riddle and played along to let Thor win, right? He seems so smug when he's like \"Hmmm I wonder where your father got that riddle from\" lmao",
            "I don't know why, it's just hilarious that Al Ewing is literally the only person so far who tried to connect his comic to GODS lol",
            "I will say, having learned of Tyr through the Norse God of War entries and *then* that his status therein as, well, the Norse God of War was hardly in line with the original myths outside of an extreme interpretation of a single line, it surprised me that he's apparently always been the God of War for the pantheon in Marvel (I assumed God of War 2018 was the first to depict him like that). Anyway, this is a long-winded way of saying I love Al Ewing and everything he does in this comic because holy shit",
            "The Odinson family face off against Oblivion to save one of their own!\n\nI kept expecting Hermod to come back somehow...is he completely done? I kind of hope not, he was one of the cooler siblings.\n\nSeeing Tiwaz again and being reminded of the Simonson run was fun. We're past Father's Day but this was a great-grandfather issue. \n\nI was thinking they shouldn't have brought the baby but she can spew hellfire so...cool? Kind of gave me bad flashbacks to her War of the Realms tie-in. \n\nThis is an Al Ewing Thor comic, of course Thor wins not with his power or hammer but with his wits and it's nice to see Odin mentioned in a positive light for once. \n\nHa, Bragi is the only sibling that seems to like Loki at this point. I guess he would considering their shared positions. \n\nAnother death of Thor to look forward to? Well, I'm sure Ewing will do interesting things with it and have it play off myths and storytelling. Plus there's the final fight with Atum I feel like they keep foreshadowing.",
            "This series took a huge hit losing Martin Coccolo. The art is ugly now and is killing my interest in the series.",
            "It is always good to see Tiwaz involved, especially with all the other Elder Gods testing Thor. Quite enjoyed the battle of wits and how Thor 'won' by making Tiwaz laugh, probably by telling the story Tiwaz himself came up with I guess. Shows to Tiwaz that Thor does have wisdom to carry the title of the All-father. And the sub-plot of what Loki is gonna do, with all these teases, thickens. Also nice that they learn Tiwaz is their grand-sire.\n\nOblivion tried to possess and we lost poor Hermod to Oblivion's hand. But knowing the comics, even 'Oblivion' is not permanent. After all, if comics exist, Oblivion simply cannot. And Thor don't care for all these 'true and final end' stuff and he has seen already MANY of them. None of which will be true.\n\nI honestly want to see more of the Children of Odin as they have quite the potential going forward. We get another 'Thor's gonna die!' vision but with Skurge's plan to take his place still going on, that will surely gonna change too. \n\nBefore all that though, we gonna have Herc and Thor having an adventure! That is one to look forward to.",
            "When Ewing retconned Tiwaz/Buri's origin to an Elder God, I got annoyed because it's just adding to the list of possible origins. Thank god he cleaned things up.",
            "Can someone explain how Oblivion was the hidden threat here and not In Betweener?\u00a0",
            "Am I stupid or was the last vision a misdirect Ullr isn't Gaia's son right?",
            "Good issue im very much glad roxxon has gone away for a while and i hope it stays like that as the roxxon stuff made me want to drop the book. \n\nThe focusing on the gods and mythology is what i want from a thor book and this is more like it.\n\nThis is still no where near Al ewings best work but its still good.",
            "love how bad Peter is at this",
            "The pacing continues to be weird, but that's baked into the 6160, and it has pros and cons to it. \n\nCurious what exactly is up with Fisk's power-tats (magic?) but making him physically as well as visually imposing is a good move. \n\nI appreciate that part of MJ's reaction to Peter's reveal is that she's...*ahem* excited. It's an honest adult feeling, and probably was a big part of the 616 dynamic too, but they couldn't really spotlight it in older comics. She loves him because he's a good man and a good father, but what wife hasn't wished her slightly dweeb husband weren't faster, stronger, *heroic* and ripped? The scary consequences come later. \n\nI like that the family reveal here wasn't overly melodramatic, but the idea that neither Peter nor MJ would be more scared for their kids is a false note. \n\nI guess one way of thinking about it, is that everyone, on some level, knows that something is deeply wrong with the world, and wishes they could do something about it, and so no one critiques Peter too hard for doing something, as long as he's 'careful'. You get the sense that MJ always knew that Peter had more in him, and maybe hoped he would do more with his life, so she can't really be harsh with him for actually doing something, but never expected it to be *this*.",
            "Loved it, glad we have Marco back and glad the whole family knows, that last page was perfection",
            "Kingpin kicks their ass 1v2 and that's to be expected. Nothing really action-packed happens in this first arc, but it's probably necessary set-up that Hickman likes to take time doing. It'll probably pick up by the time the Sinister Six are introduced.\n\nI honestly thought MJ would be a lot more pissed about Peter going around behind her back, but at least it's cute she gave him his superhero name.",
            "Amazing issue. The art, the dialogue, the plotting, showing how ill prepared both Harry and Peter are while making Kingpin truly menacing, it is all amazing. \n\nMy one gripe if I feel like MJ accepted Peter being Spider-Man a little too quickly for my linking, but is such a small gripe that I can easily look past it. I do love MJ coming up with his codename.\n\nThis book is just a giant repudiation of the post-OMD *status quo*, and I love it.",
            "Damn, King Pin is cool as hell here. Great scene.",
            "This will honestly read weird in a trade. It doesn't feel like the ending to even the first chapter in the story. Good issue, but positioning it as the end of first arc? Eh.",
            "MJ not being mad is very obviously a bit of an overcorrection from all the garbage forced on us in ASM. Makes little sense narratively, but I understand why Hickman wanted to skip it in general.",
            "I know all these Ultimate comics jump from month-to-month in real time but this is the issue that made it really feel out of sorts pacing wise because they want you to believe six months have passed yet it only feels like two at the most. Which would've made the family discovery and May accidentally blabbing feel more realistic than believing that Peter had been successfully keeping it from them or May could keep it a secret for that long. Also I'm surprised in 6 months this is the first time he's been that beat up. \n\nAlso it's been 6 months but it feels like they've barely done anything. Maybe that's why they jumped to the 1st boss even though they're obviously under-leveled. \n\nThis adult Peter really isn't 616 Peter. I don't think 616 Peter has ever been all that worked up over breaking and entering when necessary and he also is obviously out of his depth fighting major Supervillains.\n\nAh yes, the classic \"I didn't ask for this codename but I like it so I'll keep it anyways.\" \n\nIt's also setting up the division between Peter and Harry that Harry is more willing to bend the law or break it than Peter is, and Peter noticed him mentioning he got info from Bullseye so that'll probably come up again.  \n\nHonestly I wonder if 616 Kingpin could tank a laser without super-powered tattoos. \n\nIt's funny how after reading the preview people were all set for family drama but everyone is surprisingly cool with it, even MJ. Which, yeah, it's great to see Peter's family supportive and accepting of his new Superhero pastime but realistically I feel like there should be more issues on MJ's side that he lied to her for so long and is putting himself out there like this and the impact it could have on their family, but maybe when it finally starts impacting them will things take a turn for the worse. \n\nI did love how she asked him to put on the suit so she could check him out...and I imagine they went to bed straight after web-slinging. \n\nYou can tell this was designed to end for the trade because it took six months and the last issue that will be in a trade for him to get called \"Spider-Man.\" But it took six months to get there? I kind of like the idea of MJ doing it but at the same time she even points out how obvious a name it is so why didn't anyone else come up with it?",
            "Huh, so MJ really didn't know.\n\nNot quite sure what to think about this issue. Checchetto's art is amazing as always, and the fight scene with Kingpin vs Harry and Peter was cool. The cat is finally out of the bag and the Parker family knows Peter is Spider-man, and they are all mostly okay with it (for now...)\n\nBut as an ending for the first arc, it lacks a certain...pizzaz? Or maybe hook for the next part is the right phrase.\n\nOh and does anyone know if Kingpin's new Super-strength tattoos are a deep cut to anything?",
            "I dont know about anyone else but Harry's Goblin costume is really growing on me. I like that the purple coloring on the helmet makes the shape of the ears. Checchetto drawing Harry probably also helps a lot. This was a solid issue for the action alone but I really hope we get back to Ben and Jonah as they were the standouts in earlier issues.",
            "This is everything I wished for and more. Secret is out and it is handled reasonably. MJ being scared but also proud is fitting...along with other numbers for other feelings. Settle down Mrs Watson-Paker! She earned that swing! And her job/speciality just fits great too. After all, Peter will probably need all the PR as Spider-man can get and MJ would be perfect for that role. AND to handle 'keeping the identities a secret' thing too.\n\n Poor May was so scared that she blurted out the secret. Yea, seeing her father beat up like that would be scary for any young girl.\n\nGets his costume's look from his daughter. Gets his hero name from his wife. Perfection. Though now I am wondering what he is gonna get from his son. Please don't be angst.\n\nPeter already having quite the friendly dynamic with Harry and him getting the Green Goblin codename from the internet stuff...figures.\n\nThe big fight with Fisk sets the stakes quite high. Fisk by himself was bad enough but this version decided to 'enhance' himself...which makes him an actual super-powered threat now. One that can beat both Peter and Harry together ( though he was expecting them and setup a trap. Could go either way in a fair fight with more experience for Peter and Harry. ). The dynamics with Kingpin will be quite different just because of that AND the fact that Fisk is still being a rather 'small fry' compared to Maker's council above him. So it is an extra motivation for Fisk to 'improve' himself. Hell, I can see Fisk even doing an 'enemy of my enemy' stuff to get himself free of the council and team up with the Ultimates for an alliance of necessity. Because Fisk we know would never accept being under someone else.",
            "I liked the fight scene against Kingpin, but this issue is kinda meh(and now that this first arc ended, i can speak that MJ is by far the most boring character in this book and this Peter is a dumbass).",
            "Well look at that, you CAN write Peter and MJ like functional adults! Sure, naive but with nobody having an idea who he is yet, it's understandable. But she's there and supports him!",
            "I wish this was perfect. Or an amazing conclusion to the first arc.  \n  \nBut unfortunately it isn't. There is a lot of amazing stuff here, chemistry between Harry and Peter, amazing art and action.  \n  \nBut MJ and Richard were disappointment. Richard feels like a non-character and MJ feels too perfect. There is no struggle, no doubts, not even worries or arguments. Just text-book perfectism, which is nice, but not exciting.  \n  \nI don't want massive argument or anything, but something. Right now I have gotten very little from MJ as a character and I hoped this would give us something.  \n  \nI love MJ. I love her and Peter together, they are my favorite couple in comics and one of my favorites in fiction. So I wanna see her more, as three-dimensional character, not just as \"perfect wife\".  \n  \nBut I know we have only seen 6 issues. My expectations were high because this series overall has been so good. So we might get more out of MJ and Richard later.",
            "So the whole thing about peter keeping his identity a secret from his wife and son comes to an end, which is great, but the pay off from it was lack luster. Now dont get me wrong Im not asking for an amber from invincible show situation here but the reaction from mj especially reinforces a criticism i have for her: she isnt anything beyond a supportive wife. I also dont really understand what the point of having peter keeping it a secret before was if you were going to resolve it this early in the run and this easily.\n\nWith the first \"arc\" of this series finished I have to say im a bit disappointed and I really dont feel hickman brought his A game. This run thus far feels like it is carried more by the frustrations of spider-man fans and great art rather than a compelling story and characterisation. We have a peter parker who has more agency in his decision to be a superhero but less of a compelling reason to do it. We have a family that while nice to see are barely characters. We have supporting characters that are more engaging than the titular character (namely uncle ben, jonah and harry). Overall I dont think this book is bad and it always has the potential to turn things around or maybe this is sn intentional choice to build to something fantastic or maybe im missing something, regardless it doesnt change the fact that these last 6 issues have not been great reads for me.",

Jonathan Hickman has done a great job on Peter telling his family about his Spider-Man life, with his family supporting him with little worry because they know he\u2019ll be okay. Let\u2019s hope that the family will get to see Peter in action as Spider-Man. Overall, this comic is great!",

I love a well executed lore dump and I think the team told a really epic story that expanded Wakanda and created immediate stakes for T\u2019Challa. Now that he has more control of himself we can see him turn the tide against Blade/Varnae while whooping some Atlantean ass.\n\nAnd is that MCU Attuma in the background of the final page?",

Daredevil was a decent choice to get her to understand things somewhat and wanting to make her own decisions about the current situation. You also see though how veteran heroes react to the situation after being through it so many times and just going along with the toughest decisions as 'comes with the territory' and of course that would be off-putting for Brielle when they ask her to kill her dad that she just got in her life. And Dracula being the one at the forefront does not help either.\n\nGuess 'Blade' is entering the fray to take her personally now. I am wondering when the 'switch' happened for Blade because he could've easily got Brielle put in a safe place when he needed her before enacting the whole plan. So I assume whoever possessing him was not aware or recently took over while she was away. Because all this planning for this big plan but forgetting the one of the key parts, means something prevented him aside from Dracula.",

But both her book and here, it is not referenced as far as I remember.\n\nYea, I guess Tony deserved that punch but from what we read, a bigger punch gonna come from splitting with Emma I guess. Not gonna lie, I liked them together. It is more interesting than whatever they planned for Emma with From the Ashes relaunch.",
            "A nice birthday gift to see the quality of the book pick back up with this issue. I'm glad that we got to see Rhodey getting some spotlight, as well as an extended look at the Mysterium Armor in action. That display of power of beheading a Stark Sentinel with one punch? Good stuff. Speaking of the Mysterium Armor and the action, Di Vito really knows how to make it look good. Well, he knows how to make anything look good. I wish he had been the artist for the last few issues as well.\n\nIt's still a shame that the book is ending, but the \"backdoor pilot\" feel to this issue is making me hopeful for the future. Maybe the reason there haven't been news of the next run is because Marvel didn't want to spoil this development? Maybe we'll get an announcement later today if not tomorrow? I hope what I'm saying is not just wishful thinking with a side of copium. Either way, there's no way Iron Man is actually getting the axe with a tease like this. If the next book is not \"Iron Man ft. New Team\" it's gotta be \"New Team ft. Iron Man\" at the very least. And since I'm on the topic of this new development, I hope what it's leading into is a Force Works revival. The idea of making a team with villains is really good, and it speaks of Tony's precedents of giving bad guys a second chance.\n\nIf I have a major complaint about this issue, is how unrealistically smooth everything went with Rhodey's plan. Tony's narration mentions that, after finishing the Orchis clean-up, they collected the weapons cache and the villains went their merry way. You mean to tell me that none of them even tried to squirrel away with a few WMDs? C'mon... I mean, the idea of giving villains access to all of these weapons was beyond reckless, so I guess that everything went well is a silver lining. That being said, I have to give Duggan credit for having some fun and featuring some established Marvel Universe equipment in the weapons cache, like the Sky-Cycle or the Spider-Slayer. Those are fun continuity nods.\n\nAll in all, fun issue. The feeling of closure is already present, so with the next isssue being oversized, I'm hopeful the conclusion won't feel rushed. Looking forward to the finale and whatever comes next. Just wish we didn't have to endure this radio silence first.",

There are some villains who are barely evil and just do it for money rather than for the thrill of it that could be turned. I\u2019m not caught up with Spider-Man but I feel someone say miles and rhino have a good relationship. \n\nAre we meant to assume that feilong is buried fucking alive because Jesus. Surely the raft or whatever is more humane. I mean he is essentially a serial killer who never showed even a small fraction of remorse but wow talk about dark. He should have just killed him. \n\nI\u2019m on my hands and knees praying Emma frost and iron man continue",

            "Ok, we are (sort of ) back boys!!! This issue was actually pretty good. The previous issue was a bit mid, but this one is really solid. Great stuff.\n\nRhodey assembling team of bad guys (and my boy Rhino being one of them) was amazing. Tony and Rhodey had a really funny moment lol, but then we went right into the cool handshake moment between two friends.\n\nInteresting to see, what they are planning with the Rhodey going West and making a team full of reformed bad guys with Tony leading them. This is why I wish Duggan stays on the book and they just relaunch it. I feel like the next writer will just ignore this. But fingers crossed, Tony and Rhodey revive Force Works (But for the love of God, call it something else lol. Force Works doesn't not sound cool). Plus, I think it works the best, since Rhodey gave weapons to supervillains like Rhino, Stilt-Man, Sandman etc. These guys are not really evil. Douchebags? Sure. But not evil. This is not him giving weapons to Bullseye or Carnage lol\n\nI actually love Feilongs fate in this. I know some people would have been like \"Tony should have killed him, ripped his balls off, shoved his foot up his ass\" etc lol, BUT, I think that would be an easy way out. Plus, come on. Tony at the end of the day is a superhero. He defeated Feilong and he is no longer a threat. He Avenged the lost lives. Now Feilong gets to experience torture and suffer for what he did. Killing him is just getting rid of him without having him pay for what he did. He deserves to be punishment, not a quick relive.\n\nLastly, Tony and Emma's little moment was sweet. They do look cute together, and it's nice seeing both him and her, drop the mask and act like they usually are. Emma is very caring, and Tony is not afraid to express his true feelings. I will stand by this, their romance is great. Short, but great!\n\nTLDR. Good shit. TonyXEmma are cute together.",

It is not like they are unreasonable villains. I mean if Tony can still work as best friends with Cap and Carol after TWO civil wars with literal deaths, they can easily move past Jack of Hearts being alive and hell maybe even find a better solution for his dilemma. I get it is being used for drama but it has quite the easy solution so it doesn't work as well for me.\n\nEither way, hope we see She-Hulk in more Avengers adventures etc. And I do hope we see more of our favorite Eternal/Deviant duo.",

Though, I can see how someone like Maverick falling for Alyssa's ploy.\n\nThey play on the knowledge of Blade being behind all this and how that effects Logan's thinking and Louise too. I mean, yea, she would question herself after hearing how the most famous vampire hunter suddenly revealed to be behind the whole vampire apocalypse after possibly giving into his darker urges. If it that can happen to Blade, what chance would she have?

No sources, or archeology substantiate any further claim he makes. But for a few noteable mistakes:\n\n1. Tiwaz is a rune/letter and the first in T\u00fdr's name and thus connected to him, but nothing suggests it was his actual name any more than J is the original name of Jesus.\n2. Nothing beyond vague etymological connection to a completely different religion suggests Tyr was ever a god of the sky.\n3. He claims Christians mixed up Tyr and Odin's positions but this is impossible, because we know Odin was equated to Mercury and the Roman Tacitus mentions Mercury as the main god of the germanics before Christianity was a thing.\n4. He claims that it is actually Tyr and not Odin leads the gods during Ragnarok, but neither is clearly depicted as leading the gods in the final battle, with several tellings not even mentioning Tyr.\n5. No depiction of Tyr holding the sun and the moon exists.\n6. Odin is very clearly not the father of all gods in Snorri's works, neither Njord or Ullr who were very major gods were sons of Odin.\n\nThis guy is a complete hack.

Besides, Marvel had the perfect way to use him by having him and Eve go on a criminal anti-hero duo road trip full of murder, chaos, and revenge as they hunt down Beyond's upper brass while killing its henchmen and destroy their bases and resources.",
            "Yeah, it's only a few. I just meant that there's nothing really unifying them other than they all came together in Utgard after the fall of the Elder Gods.\n\nI forgot, actually, that he wasn't even one of the five Utgard gods- he was just called the Utgard-Odin as a \"Boy, that's a terrifying though, huh?\"",
            "At the moment, this is the start of the \"Utgard gods\" as a pantheon, unless Utgard-Loki, Toranos, and the other 3 mentioned are \"Those Who Sit Above In Shadow\" (which... there's 5 of mentioned gods in Utgard and 5 who are part of TWSAIS, so it's possible), who were from Utgard, but have rarely appeared and not been particularly elaborated on beforehand.\n\nTWSAIS appeared first in the 80s, during *X-Men/Alpha Flight*, when Loki tried to win their favor, but his gifts of power to humanity were rejected (the recipients didn't want to have the side effect of losing their creativity), and TWSAIS were not pleased when he tried to force it on humanity anyways. Loki also tried to trick the twins of Alpha Flight (Aurora and Northstar) into thinking they were elves, not mutants, or something, and punished him.\n\nThen they appeared at the end of Thor Vol. 2 (during Thor's \"Ragnarok\" arc, part of the wider \"Avengers Disassembled\" event), where they were revealed to be feeding off of the deaths of the Asgardians in a continuous Ragnarok cycle, where every Ragnarok is followed by rebirth. Thor became \"Rune King Thor\" to end the cycle- seemingly killing them.\n\nThey didn't die, turns out. In *Loki: Agent of Asgard*, also written by Al Ewing, *Immortal Thor*'s author, they showed up to warn Odin that reality was ending (this was just before Secret Wars 2015, in the lead up to the destruction of the Multiverse), and then later demanded Loki hand over the essence of the Asgardians after he managed to exit reality to avoid destruction, until Loki scared them off with an existential crisis about their existence and source.\n\nAll of that took place in... 7 issues. That's 2 issues for *X-Men/Alpha Flight*, 1 issue of *Alpha Flight* for the Loki-twins, 2 issues of *Thor* for the Ragnarok arc, and 2 issues of *Loki: Agent of Asgard* for the Secret Wars/end of the multiverse appearance. So... not a lot of actual involvement in the past. Assuming they even are the same deities as the current Utgard-Gods of *Immortal Thor*.",
            "They didn't really exist like this before Ewing. They showed up a few times as \"[Those Who Sit Above In Shadow](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Those_Who_Sit_Above_in_Shadow_(Earth-616))\", nebulous, spooky beings who were said to be far more powerful than the Asgardians. They had no names or backstory, and they only acted as a unit.\n\nEwing himself made a couple possible explanations for them at the end of his Loki series, but neither of them fit with the backstory he's established in this series.",
            "I've read the primary sources of Norse and germanic mythology as well as the related Sami mythology, including the icelandic Eddas, the danish Gesta Danorum and the roman Germania. So I have a good idea when people presents speculation as facts. \n\nI'm curious as to what concrete proof you are refering to because actual historians and linguists have also called into question the entire Tyr as the original top god as pretty unsubstantiated. For example Old norse linguist Jackson Crawford [has a video on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=387cIw-Hf6k).",

Just that I'd be bummed if that happened because I enjoy her as a character, and she's an archetype that usually only men inhabit in stories, so that's neat IMO. But I do agree with you generally that Wells has been weirdly risk averse despite continually seeming to tease big dark srs consequences in this run; the only person who's died thus far has been Kamala, who...y'know. Immediately got better, lmao \n\nOh, and I guess if we're counting technicalities, *maybe* the kids from the Paul Dimension? lol",
            "Well Ben was an expert in shady companies since he ran one that was a predatory snake oil scam. I wouldn't have had the audacity to try and steal Peter's superhero identity. Shoot i don't thing I would have the nerve to come back to New York after causing a zombie plague.",

SMS who made GoW made thorough research said Tyr was at least held in higher regard than Odin in BC era.\n\nI'm sorry if I sounded like I don't believe you :(\n\nI believe you and I love talking about IRL mythology. We can DM so we don't derail the thread if you want :)",
            "You keep calling her shallow in every thread, but she just hasn't had a lot of focus yet. Just because you don't like her doesn't mean the \"quality standard for the fanbase is awful\". If anything it just means you're impatient.",
            "Ironically, his resurrection thing worked, its just that he was crazy and being controlled by someone else.",
            "Then again if she hasn\u2019t had any focus in six issues I think it\u2019s fair to call her a shallow character (so far).",
            "I am patient and agree that she didn't have focus, but this lack of focus impacts her characterization(and by quality standard, i mean that to hail this version as an great character, even though she barely received focus and as a consequence didn't receive a lot of character because she was just seen among Peter's family plot and barely did anything, besides support and give him the codename, wich i think is a very interesting and unique idea).",
            "They didn't pay for unstable clones, they wanted him to treat their loved ones.",
            "Look, after the last couple years, I think it's fair that Spider-Man fans are just happy to have a supportive MJ again, admittedly she's not super fleshed out yet, but the small stuff we do get from her is still nice and that support does add a bit of character on its own.",
            "I mean so far it's basically just the Peter and Harry show during this first arc setting everything up. Ben, Jonah, the kids, Gwen, Fisk- the entire supporting cast has had about the same quantity/quality of characterization as MJ so the focus on her being the \"shallow\" one just comes off as a personal gripe. Hickman's famously a slow-burner when he gets to have his way and as much as the phrase is over-used at the moment, let the guy cook for a while.",
            "The fact that they\u2019re downvoting you for simply explaining your position and expanding your critiques just proves to me the fan base is in rabid mode right now.",
            "While i understand the sentiment, i still maintain my position(and my complain about the fanbase is also based on the reaction that Insomniac MJ have).",
            "I would say jonah and ben are above everyone else except harry because of how they handle kingpin buying the daily bugle. Not only does it give them their own little subplot but also helps characterise them by how they choose to move forward. The others on the other hand barely have anything going on that distinguishes them or makes them interesting. Maybe the supporting cast becomes more interesting later but you cant just use the potentiality of it becoming better to deflect from the fact its not good now.",
            "My focus is because issue 6 is the last issue that i read and the first arc is over, so i think the time of me being nice to this comic is ending, that is the reason why i am being more harsh(and about MJ, i already spoke that while she has this shallow character for now, the praise she gets just for having one character trait is really annoying, and this makes me think that maybe the quality of the writing isn't the priority for a vocal part of the fanbase).\n\nAnd about Peter, i will admit that he is kinda mid too, and in fact his writing really deserves more criticism because he is the protagonist of the comic(but i hope that the second arc develop them way more, because Harry is the one carrying this story).",
            "There was a time where the fanbase wasn't in rabid mode?"

            "Yeah seriously. Frank is SO FAR down the list of people the Avengers should even blink at that it's not even funny.\n\nNot condoning what he does, but Frank goes after gangsters, heinous criminals and the like. That sounds like the responsibility of the FBI ffs.",
            "Okay there's some logic. I haven't read this specific comic, but there is somethings you're missing: Peter is always flagged in the media as a vigilante at best or an outright criminal at worst.\n\nThere is a power in public perception. He knows he is not, but he also knows that \"innocent* lives may be lost because of a lack of faith in superheroes. \n\nPunisher isn't just hurting criminals, he is hurting the perception of heroes and thus endangering many civilians who won't trust the heroes when they need to.\n\nThink of it this way: cops in the USA. The vast majority are good people, but there are some total douches who take the law in to their own hands. Because of this people are hesitant to call cops even when doing so can save lives. Not all cops are bad, but the good ones who let bad cops keep going, well those are bad cops too.\n\nSpider-Man is the cop who would call out other cops for police brutality. Punisher is the cop who would kill instead of arrest, and the rest of the avengers outside of Steve are the cops who will sit back and let the bad cop kill someone and cover it up.",

Villains can\u2019t take him. Heroes let him do his thing. Even worse, he does it right under their noses in NYC and has been doing so for a loooong time just because they turn a blind eye. They need a better answer to him.\n\nOnly thing I don\u2019t get is Spidey going to them for help. Ask them to construct the prison, sure. But Spidey could handle Frank himself and show up here with him webbed up. Frank is definitely a street level issue, so no need to go to Thor for him when Spidey himself is already overkill. I think Spidey just needs a better answer to incarceration, but I feel like a genius like him could figure that out too.",
            "They literally spend the next four issues hunting him down and locking him up. But yes, Punisher being a popular character means he will always have ongoing stories.",
            "I mean, Black Widow not having a problem is reasonable, she was an assassin and government black ops. But, other than her, no one should turn a blind eye to it.",
            "> I don\u2019t know, the whole none killing rules doesn\u2019t make sense\n\nI mean, this is comics.  Thanks to 60+ years of continuity, nothing makes sense.\n\nThe Avengers used to have a fairly strict no killing code.  Hawkeye famously divorced his wife for 'letting' a villain die.  The Avengers had a major schism when half the team decided to 'revenge kill' the Supreme Intelligence for killing billions.\n\nOver the years and as media in general has evolved, this stance has evolved.  Some of it in ways that make sense -- if Captain America incidentally kills a terrorist when stopping them or if Thor kills the Sentry as the only way to stop him when he's out of control, they don't sweat it too much.\n\nBut you don't seem them planning to murder people in groups, and killing is usually either a last resort or unavoidable.    (Though this isn't always consistent, for example certain writers like to make Hawkeye try to kill Norman Osborn.  Or have him kill Bruce Banner.)\n\nBut overall, the Avengers are either private citizens, or government adjacent.  As you mention elected officials can choose to bomb people -- the Government has a monopoly on force.  They decide when it's applicable or not, within the guidelines of our laws (at least optimally).\n\nWhat the Punisher does is straight out mass murder.  He doesn't try to arrest criminals, he sets out to kill them.  He ambushes them, tortures them, maims them... murder is the main course.  Spidey is basically right, he is a mass murderer and it makes sense the the Avengers would try to catch him if the circumstances were right.",

He keeps order and has strong morals although his methods are extreme he showed Cap that Cap was bending his morals here.

He had to watch, helpless to do anything. Also, in Cap\u2019s case he ended up frozen while performing a mission, something with inherent risk. Punisher was at the park.

            "Fair point. My replies are sloppy today, thank you.\n\nAs imprecise as I was, what I mean is that it's disingenuous to say that all he's ever killed are bigots and undead Hand ninjas. Logan has 100% killed regular people. But I also don't think it really matters aside from informing his views on killing.\n\nHonestly, and this is open to interpretation, I don't think Logan has outright murdered many people. Killed, yes. But murdered is another story. I can recall countless times he's tried to avoid even fighting and only killed someone when pushed into it.\n\nAnd then you have Frank who will 100% ambush someone and shoot them in the head if it gives him a tactical advantage.",

            "> You\u2019re not making a point.\n\nYou might disagree with my point, but if you're just going to pretend it's not there because you don't like it, we have nothing left to discuss. Have a nice weekend.",
            "Well, it doesn't look like there was any world shattering events at that particular moment. Looks like Peter came to them on their day off and was like hey this guy is a serious problem with everyone in this room we could do a half day trip and be done by dinner time.",

            "Thor - You loved the movies and were happy that they made him a better character as a result.\n\nSentry - You chose this one to be different, didn't you?\n\nSpider-Man - This is the correct choice, well done.\n\nBlack Cat - WE GET IT YOU'RE HORNY (we all are too it's okay!)",
            " It\u2019s clear that you really enjoy characters with redemption arch\u2019s as one of their defining arch\u2019s. Thor being casted out and becoming worthy again, sentry trying to do good as a hero and recover from his past traumas, Spider-Man with him letting the thief go who proceeded to kill uncle Ben (and I mean who doesn\u2019t like Him), and black cat who\u2019s almost always \u201ctrying\u201d to be more of a hero. Like in Dan Slots Big time. These are all hero\u2019s who have done bad or allowed bad to happen. But ultimately the rise above it and serve the greater good rather then letting their past define them. I think it shows that you may have some what of a guilty conscience and that you\u2019re always looking to do better or be better. It could be that you hurt someone in a way you didn\u2019t mean to, or maybe you used to be highschool flash Thompson and now you\u2019re trying to be agent venom. Either way I believe this shows you\u2019re willing to grow and that you\u2019re over all a person who seeks to earn forgiveness and trust.",
