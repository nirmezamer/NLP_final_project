Got my motorcycle licence, became a race marshal, spending almost every weekend on a racetrack. I even got an XBox (i know, i know ...) and tried Forza in multiplayer yesterday. It was actually fun (solo mode is terrible though).\n\nI want to keep it casual (not gonna happen, but i'll try). What are my options ?\n\nMy \"priorities\" (if not \"requirements) :\n\n* Simulation, not arcade\n* Safety rating is good, but it's ok to not be as strict as iRacing. There are a few \"wreckers\" in Forza but they are ridiculously easy to spot and fun to see them miss their target. Sure, it makes me lose the race sometime but that's ok as long as it's not destruction derby.\n* \"quick join\" is a must. i don't want to spend time setting up team, private server, schedule, ... keep it casual whenever i feel like it. it's ok if the matchmaking is \"meh\".\n* I'd love to see \"endurance\" race (longer than an hour) but it's ok if it's not possible\n* racetrack ! not a rally or open road game.\n\nI'm not a console gamer (i pretty much use it exclusively for diablo4 and some casual gamepass game) and i don't know what are my racing game/sim options. i tried Forza because it was on Gamepass.\n\nI'll probably stay on gamepad because if i start setting up my sim rig, i'll end up playing iRacing all over again.
