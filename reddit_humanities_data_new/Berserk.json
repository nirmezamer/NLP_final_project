            "We about to head back to war, boys and girls.",
            "I literally cheered when they completely skipped the boat ride lmao",
            "Is it just me, or has the art in the past two chapters been way better than before? 365-374 looked decent, but characters would sometimes look a bit wonky and everything also just looked very grey. 375 and 376 look really good in my opinion, and honestly don\u2019t look much worse than Miura\u2019s art (obviously Miura\u2019s was better, but it almost certainly never will be as good as his). If Studio Gaga can keep up with this quality, I\u2019ll be very happy.",
            "RIP to all the strugglers who didn't make it to see this moment. \n\nIt really feels like we're approaching the end game and the team is doing an absolutely fantastic job! The art is absolutely fantastic and it seems like the team has really come into their own style while maintaining Miura's. Not only that but we skipped the boat ride!\n\nI'm really curious to see how this war progresses. It's a bit curious to me that the Kushan have Guts chained up for now when the rest of the crew is being recruited to fight. I get their logic but I can't wait to see Guts and the Kushans bring the fight to Griffith.",
            "Finally the new chapter has come! While it's a short chapter, the pace is fast, they skip another boat arc, \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. I hope it doesn't take another 6 months for the next chapter to release. Young Animals really need to fix their schedule, because Studio Gaga was already finished this chapter months ago.",
            "The pacing is pretty good for such a short chapter, alot has been answered and more questions have arisen in the same breath. Excited for the new chapter whenever that drops.",
            "Congratulations to studio Gaga and Mori, i love how they are able to capture the essence of Berserk.\n\nAltough a short chapter im glad the story is moving with a good pace, i wonder how they plan to wage war\u2026",
            "I don't see how the Kushans could possibly fight Griffith. We in trouble.",
            "This reminds me of the Battle of Minas Tirith. Under normal circumstances, there will be no victory... In the end, I hope, win or lose, Guts takes one or more steps forward. I don't want to see another one-sided war with that fucking Griffith smirk!",
            "This chapter, while many definitely foresaw the story heading to this point, did more to move the story of Berserk than the past 2 years. Well done studio Gaga and Mori",
            "I guess for now the story progresses in an expected manner for the foreseeable future.",
            "Mommy Morda is back baby",
            "Final war arc coming soon!",
            "So they are headed for the final fight? It seems too soon for them to fight Griffith. For sure Guts needs some kind of power up... but maybe the moonlight boy is going to be a problem for Griffith soon enough",
            "What i don't really understand is how Puck doesn't remember Rickert. I remember when they arrived on Elfheim he remembered his other elf friends and other people even though he was away for a long time. Maybe he doesn't want to discuss heavy things near Isidro or the group.",
            "The building they're in is based on the Hagia Sophia in Instanbul/Constantinople! It was the largest church in the world for 1000 years and then it was converted into a Mosque when the Turks conquered the city. Had the pleasure to be there in person! So cool they incorporated it into Berserk!",
            "Art was amazing ong",
            ">!I liked this chapter. The art definitely looks better than the previous chapters. I like how at the start of the chapter we see Schierke waking Guts up, so now Guts is finally awake. The scene where Schierke woke Guts up also reminded me a lot of the great roar of the astral world. I do like the stuff that was shown in the chapter. I predicted that the Kushans were going to go to war with Griffith, and now it\u2019s become true. I\u2019m excited to see what\u2019s going to happen in the next chapters, especially with Daiba taking everyone underneath his wing. I hope we get to see Daiba talk to Guts about the Kshatriya Of Durga soon. Also it\u2019s good to see that Hanarr is still here. If the theories about Guts learning to control the Berserker Armor comes true, then Hanarr will have a big role to play in it.!<",
            "The art is impressive and this chapter, with all the due respect, is even better than some of the latest Miura ones.\nThey also skipped the boat trip, added lots of dialogues and improved on everything. We cant ask for more.\nThe ONLY thing I dont like is how fast they skip over important things, like Rickert meeting Puck and than letting it go without an answer.\nOr, after everything we have seen from Guts falling into desperation, the way he wakes up with the usual Schierke panel touch his hand.",
            "Well, it appears Guts is not lost. Schierke is stepping up. We may be getting a set up for them to find Casca together.\u00a0\n\n\nI was a little nervous about Guts being a dungeon, but when Salit said he is \"danger to himself\" I got it.\u00a0\n\n\nBut, we are going to war.\u00a0 They said the vol 43 will be out this year, so we might be seeing four more chapters, at min before 2024 ends.\u00a0",
            "Have any of the usual twitter leakers said anything about when 377 is coming out? There's nothing in the last page. I sure hope it's not a six months wait...",
            "Cool seeing decade old predictions coming to fruition. I remember thinking I can't wait to see Daiba and Guts fight on the same team. Berserk needs more powerful mages that aren't afraid to get their hands dirty.",
            "Good episode, the story is finally starting to progress. Hope we don\u2019t have to wait another 6 months for the next one tho",
            "To me it seems like the Kushans are going to completely screw things over for themselves if they stick to their current plan. Not only are they supressing their most valuable assets but because they're treating them like rank-in-file members, they won't know how to fully and effectively utilise them",
            "I wonder what Silat is plotting, if he is trying to take on the griffith head on",
            "Nice plot speedrun, welp see you guys in 2025",
            "Just hoping for the war between kushans and Band of the hawk",
            "The art in this ep looks better than it's ever been, they're really stepping it up! Everything else is...more or less about as good as I expected\n\n(I get the feeling people misinterpreted the last part of my comment based on the upvotes I've gotten. I expected this chapter to be subpar at best in terms of everything but art)",
            "They finally got the courage to write real dialogue.\n\nWhen they first took over it seemed like they were too scared of the task to actually write dialogue.\n\nI think the art looked great + the dialogue felt right.\n\nGlad they found their groove.",
            "can\u2019t believe guts is still sad and they join forces with the Dank Kush squad",
            "The panel of Schierke holding Guts hand is so beautiful \nThe friendship and trust between these two is so pure and underrated, she won't let him fall in the Darkness.\nThe art in this chapter is Amazing, great work by studio gaga and Koji Mori",
            "It feels like we're starting to reach the beginning of the end and I am all for it. A bit concerned about Schierke, but maybe Flora will help her out to navigate through the deeper parts of the astral realm. Afterall I think Flora said that she wouldn't be really dead and it's more of a transition.\u00a0\n\n\nOr as Vampire Hunger D said, we are but transient guests.",
            "You know when i said \"See you guys in 6 months.\" I ment it as a joke, i didn't actually mean it. I'm sorry.",
            "One interesting thing about the world here is that we assumed for a long time that things must be totally apocalyptic outside of Falconia, because of the Roar of the Astral World, but clearly the Kushan are able to still have a functional society and defend their people from monsters even though they lost their God-Emperor. It puts lie to a big argument for Falconia, that only Griffith can bring safety to society as a whole. It makes me think that Guts getting revenge on Griffith won't necessarily mean society will collapse and that there might be other civilizations out there still surviving",
            "Man Schierke is so goated",
            "hypeee",
            "I hope Schierke's deep dive leads to a chat with Flora about the causality spiral of her past that the current party is living through",
            "I totally forgot that Miura didn't draw these panels. Was a great chapter, I'm glad we are finally making real progress in the story. RIP. Studio Gaga is doing an amazing job.",
            "Man the chapter was great, Im excite for where it will all go to. I really wish Miura himself was still here to finish up his story... mad props to studio Gaga for doing this still.\n\nWith that said I gotta ask.... am I the only one who REALLY does not trust Daiba? Silat seems like a decent guy, hes leader of an opressed group or people back in his own land... but Daiba was the right hand man and advisor to the very leader of that land, I feel like right now hes working an \"enemy of my enemy\" mentality, but I dont really find him a trustworthy ally in the slightest.",
            "So Griffith destroyed Elfhelm because he was wary of it, he is going after Kushan next for the same reasons, but Kushan is fighting back and joining forces with Guts and co.\n\nThe way things stand now it will most likely be imo:\n\n  -  The Kushan empire\n\n  - Elfhelm (all remaining mages and creatures) unter Daiba's lead\n\n  -  The Skull Knight\n\n\n  -  Guts and friends (among them Farnese who could move the Holy Iron Chain Knights to join)\n\nAgainst Griffith and his Demons. Probably with some kind of upgrade for Guts.\n\n  Zodd, who appears to be unhappy in Falconia, is pretty much the wildcard who could decide the battle.",
            "The art in this chapter has reached Berserk level art. Congratulations to the artists for getting at this level so soon. Their work ethic is obvious with the release of this chapter. I can't wait for the future of Berserk, It's in good hands. Thank you studio Gaga, this chapter was a masterpiece both art and dialogue wise",
            "[removed]",
            "They are really letting go of chestnut puck, when Miura had puck just floating around he was always chestnut form, but not anymore",
            "We're confirmed to be getting volume 43 this year in Japan by the way, so they'll probably 'speed up' with chapter releases for the rest of the year.. But that isn't really saying much.",
            "So Silat has taken charge of the Kushan Empire then......\n\nI get his reasoning for why they need to attack Griffith, but I don't see how they can win. Mages or no mages.",
            "One thing that irks me. Did the plot point about going to the Bakiraka Hidden Village get dropped or did they change it to going to the Kushan capital after Daiba joined Rickert's party? Like If Rickert and Silat and all were sailing there it'd make sense but it seems they're just in Kushan's capital now.",
            "Seeing Guts chained up \ud83d\ude1e",
            "So, what's wrong with Puck? Why can't he remember Godo and Rickert? Not sure if I'm thinking too much into it, but felt a bit like they were trying to set something up here with him being sus. Would be weird if he's just stupid",
            "Considering what happened to Ganishka i hope the Kushan army has some real strategy to defend it\u2019s borders against Griffith.\n\nOr maybe they\u2019re just going to scream \u201cdeath\u201d  Rohirrim style and charge at their enemies.",
            "This chapter was, simply put: amazing. \n\nAlso: [Mordussy](https://ibb.co/CpjCzWd), so that's a plus.",
            "This must be Studio Gaga's best chapter yet. Atleast artisticly speaking.",
            "Rickert's interaction with Puck has been weird as hell. I don't get why they wouldn't recognize each other, especially after the important heart-to-heart talk they had in Godot's place. Why's Puck ignoring him? I hope he doesn't act that way towards Erica too.\n\nBut aside from that, I'm glad that we're finally getting some exposure to the Kushan rebellion and their intent to go after Falconia.",
            "I\u2019m glad they decided to show some non chestnut puck! I want to see him talk with Guts again",
            "The new chapter was worth the wait, I love the art style and seeing the gang with Rickert.\n\n  \n>!I hope Schierke will live to the end of the story, with her ability to be within the astral realm I know Griffith will target her. I am thankful she helped Guts once more to gain consciousness.!< I'm curious since the Kushan are prepping for war against Griffith will the story switch over to Casca in Falconia now.",
            "I want to see kushan magic and witchcraft imbued on guts sword. Hoping to one day see that shocked griffith face",
            "A lot of people are talking about how Kushans are not playing their cards right in terms of planning, but i think 99% apostles can be handled by the magic squad under Daiba. I'm pretty sure Rickert has maybe figured out how he was able to harm Griffith, or they have an idea. \n\nOther than that, I'm pretty sure we will see Farnese strengthen her magic prowess to wake Schierke up. I love the pacing, now we wait.",
            "[removed]",
            "One thing I found odd was that Silat also doesn't recall Guts' name. When in chapter 43 he says, \"Guts was it? I'll remember your name.\" \n\nHe recognizes him again when Guts kills the Kushan in chapter 134 and says that he knew him at one point. Perhaps it's Silat being coy or something, but I found that a little strange.",
            "anyone realize the castle they are in is like a exact replica of the hagia sophia?",
            "What does Silat have that Ganishka did not? Rickert's inventions and a few mages? I feel like Griffith will win this battle, but lose the war, if there is still a happy ending. \n\nGreat episode, can't wait to see Rickert and Guts back together.",
            "I am SO stoked on Daiba being back, he was a favorite. \n\nI'm wondering how Guts will take being used as a pawn again for someone else's cause, even though that cause may be the same as his own.",
            "Good chapter. Interesting stuff with the Kushans planning to take the heroes in and declaring war on Griffith, although I'm not sure how a war between the Kushans and Griffith is going to be anything other than a massacre.",
            "Our first real glimpse of what the end is going to look like. What a phenomenal chapter. The birth of a new story arc for the first time in about 15 years since Elf Island and Fantasia began. I genuinely feel like crying when I think about everything it's taken to get to this point, especially about Miura. It makes me so happy that I'll likely get to see the end of this story someday,",
            "So glad Puck isn\u00b4t chestnut anymore",
            "As a vedic astrologer, the way that Miura brought up Rahu and the nodes, I have a weird feeling that this story is going to end on a Lunar eclipse.  I found it amazing that he used Rahu as the node that the Eclipse took place under instead of Ketu. You can tell that Miura in the manga from that note that he is well versed in Vedic Astrology.  A Solar Eclipse would symbolize the void, singularity, absolute, inhuman, etc.  A Lunar Eclipse would signfy blood(known as a blood moon), humanity, duality, freewill, etc.  I expect downvotes for this, but you only live once :D.",
            "I am pretty sure that the much needed upgrade to face the God Hand will be delivered by Daiba and his deep understanding of the metaphysics and dark arts. \n\nWas really happy to see this old lad again.",
            "Solid pacing, Beautiful Art and healthy flow. Always grateful for the Berserk chapter!",
            "Hey it's my birthday today and I got a new chapter of berserk for it thanks big man miura in the sky <3",
            "Real tear jerker chapter. The art is AMAZING! Studio Gaga just continues to impress with better and better art. I feel like the writing and the dialogue has improved a lot too, there's just enough talking and it feels very Berserk. I love it SO much. \n\nCan't tell if Puck is ignoring Rickert because Puck or if him surviving the fall of Elfhelm was somehow a fluke and he's about to start going thru it. Really not ready for the \"Fan favorite silly elf gets dementia and slowly dies scared and alone\" arc so lets hope and pray Puck is just doing silly Puck things.",
            "the kushaan being portrayed in a slightly better light is very interesting, maybe they have more understanding of griffith or the god hand",
            "How will a shitty chain hold a guy who can swing a 400 pounds sword? I know Guts is depressed and won't try escaping, but still a non-sensical move by Kushan. Giving him a cozy bed is probably a better idea.",
            "[removed]",
            "I feel like an eclipse situation could happen. Cascas gone again but regained concisousness, and going to war with Griffith could result in several deaths.\n\nAnd who knows how long schierke will be asleep.",
            "Pretty good the art is fantastic in this chapter i\u2019m excited for 377 so hopefully it comes out this year",
            "Sounds like a free ride to Falconia!",
            "Wait so the Kushans know about elfheim?",
            "It\u2019s going to be ragnarok type of deal. Guts will be their general leading the war",
            "To war then",
            "Any whispers of a new issue?",
            "[removed]",
            "Holy Mother Fucking Shit, the Blacksmith that made the Berserker Armor is with gut's party.  let's fucking go, upgrades!",
            "That's a nice little touch to make Silat's eyeliner and Griffith's helmet visor holes the same shape.",
            "Goddamn the art has gotten a major glow up. The hard outline style is back, Gaga has gotten far more comfortable with Muira's style.",
            "Man, the catharsis of absolutely inhaling another chapter after a long wait is like the rush you get from finally beating a boss in a FromSoft game",
            "Short chapter but I like where it's going. Guts it's finally out of the Berserker armor, which will probably help him a lot. The gang seems to be in no danger for the moment. I think chestnut puck should be the one to forget Rickert being more of a comical moment. And I cannot express how much I can't wait for Isidro to finally learn that Guts was in the band of the Hawk and the 100 men slayer. I don't think that we should mention the art anymore, but for the record it's great!",
            "The art is fucking perfect",
            "Solid chapter. \n\nThis is the first Mori chapter that feels like proper Berserk, it advances the story forward without much flash but only with dialoge. After many chapters that felt rudderless, this one shows a clear path. Worth the wait.",

            "The Republic Alliance of Berserk",
            "Shit got me hyped, WAR IS UPON US",
            "A big hope I have for the next few chapters especially with Guts awake that he and Puck will talk and we can see more of them interact.",
            "The art is AMAZING",
            "Man I already lost track of the story .\\_.",
            "If 8 head doesn't die in this war its not gonna be worth it",
            "Honestly was impressed by how the art looked this chapter. The dialogue stayed true to the characters as well, and finally the story is moving forward. 8/10 overall, Mori and the team are improving, love to see it.",
            "at least we're out of boat arc",
            "I've been waiting for all the warriors to come team up together and kick Griffith's ass alrwady for the longest time, so I thoroughly enjoyed this chapter. I'm only getting more and more hype with each new Berserk chapter because it really feels like we're reaching the beginning of the final climatic arc for this long story. I have faith that Mori and Studio Gaga will be able to deliver on the conclusion Miura would've given us. I can't wait to see how it ends.",
            "I gotta say I adore the art, they are nailing it rn. The pacing is also great, it really feels appropriate considering where the story is at. I'm confident they'll be able to pull of the (I assume) final arc well, especially considering how well Miura set this all up",
            "Even with the team Guts and Elfheim residents in their ranks, Kushan is a clear underdog I can't wait to see this battle. My theory is that they will figure out Griffith and Moonlight Boy's conundrum and pull an \"Avatar Solar Eclipse spec ops mission\" where the moon goes on a special phase every 567 years to separate their souls, attacking while Femto is at its weakest.",
            "I hope for the best for Guts \n\nIs it wrong to pray he has some peace at the end?",
            "Ngl I thought the manga went back on hiatus for some reason.. the last chapter I read was 370. At least now I get to read a few chapters",

            "Holy shit we\u2019re getting close, shits getting serious now",
            "this war is gonna be insane i can\u2019t wait!!!!!",
            "Pacing was really good \ud83d\udc4c they seem to understand that its time to approach the endgame.",
            "I liked this chapter a lot, the stakes are raising, a war is brewing.\n\nI suspect (and this is entirely my theory, and I'm not saying it's bad) this is because Studio Gaga and Mori don't really have much detail on the ending of Berserk other than general stuff such as \"there will be a war\", so after wrapping the last arc they're not entertaining no nonsense and jumped into the first steps of a war between the Kushan as proxy for the mc group and Falconia.\n\nI feel that Studio Gaga is finally being more confident with drawing, previous chapters had been criticized because some of the characters looked like Miura's design and composition but a bit weird, in this chapter I don't see that, they've certainly improved in a lot of areas and I also see certain shy redesigns instead, I guess Gaga is finally appropiating Berserk instead of trying to emulate someone else's artstyle (no matter how used to aiding in that style they were, and it's not like Gaga's artstyle is that different from Miura's, they were his trainees at the end of the day). I'm loving that a lot.\n\nI also like the Kushans are going to apparently be allies (even if temporal/until the main characters can escape) after being portrayed consistently as monstruous and brutal.",
            "Really solid chapter, character art is looking really really good. Backgrounds still feel a little washed out at times but this was another great step in the right direction.",
            "Wow! I was really sceptical towards Gaga cuz they managed to copy Miura style mostly but not perfectly. But this is majestic! It seems they really grasped Miura style. I hope it will continue like this from now on.",
            "I\u2019m so hype guys. Final arc incoming",
            "I liked this chapter, it has great dialogue with enough information, the art work is getting a look better with some very good panels and Guts looks better, so is a W for me.\n\nI only wish they could deliver the chapter more often, but it is what it is.",
            "What a wonderful chapter, the series is going to end soon, so happy to see Miura\u2019s work being continued.",
            "I might be wrong and it's gonna be wild, but after this chapter I see things very straightforward now. \n\nKushan Empire vs Falconia = Falconia wins. New eclipse using Gut's beherit and here Casca or Guts will become a God Hand. It will be God Casca/Guts vs God Griffith, and Griffith will die for good, ending Fantasia and returning the worlds/dimensions to its places. Demons will be gone, the fairies will be back.\n\nLE END.\n\nDumb theories apart, I'm sure I'll regret not seeing far more about the God Hands. Feels like they could have their own standalone stories.",
            "goated chapter. Studio gaga and Mori are doing a phenomenal job. all that talk about \u201cberserk should\u2019ve ended at chapter 364 \u261d\ufe0f\ud83e\udd13\u201d go fuck urself. this manga lives on",
            "So overall the chapter imo was a solid 7/10\n\n\nSome positives-\n\n\nGreat Art(I love the art with this one, puck, rickert ,silat, schierke and the initial astral layer scene with guts and schierke\n\n\nPacing. They are not wasting time and addressing plot points which is good to see story progress considering the long 5-6 month.\n\n\nNegatives-\n\n\nThey definitely aren't trying to weave the story properly.\u00a0\nExcessive use of plot conveniences like the ship getting drifted away, and how did guts end up in astral realm?Simple answer- We don't know and I don't think they are going to address a lot of points too.\n\n\nStupid character reactions. Weird it had the best artwork so far yet had very odd facial features. When silat announces war...the faces of serpico and farnese like it feels so weird.\n\n\nA nitpick but i just dont like the village of kushan is very \"indian enough\".\n\n\nThe entire thing with rickert and puck. what's up with isidro too? He was initally heartbroken and now he feels like he is going to fight in a war,pissed off from everything. Puck forgetting rickert? Like yeah Miura didn't use puck to fullest since Lost children but let's be honest Puck forgetting about rickert is really stupid.\n\n\nI am still hyped up with Guts and dragonslayer reunion but I want more CASCA scenes!!!",

            "They are drawing much better, especially the city and Serpico(he was awful in the old Gaga chapter). The story is going where i thought it was going and it's nice that they're talking to each other",
            "it was so worth the wait!,  the art its absolutely incredible, and this is most noticeable in the desing of guts, which at the beginning of the \"mori-gaga era\" was so sketchy but now is so good. Im so ready for this war, i hope this is not the end tho, i remember miura saying that there are going to be multiple battles between guts and giffith in the future, so i hope this was taken into consideration by mori. \n\nFinally, I HATE GRIFFITH.",
            "Berserk never lets you down! It was a long wait, but it was a very rich chapter both in terms of drawings and content, I didn't expect the Kushan to be marching again against Griffith, I thought they might be building up defenses waiting for the Falconian army to attack, now I'm really curious to see what the current state of their army is.",

            "Not seeing a lot of people talk about this but I find it sad how they have based the Kushan City off of Constantinople whereas before they have always looked based on Indian and Central Asian cultures. Ganishka's palace and throne room looked gorgeous and were both based on some Indian styles uncommon to see in fantasy but now the city is just shown as regular oriental architectures like you would see in any other 'regular' fantasy.\n\nI am also not sure about what they are doing with Puck, his with interaction Rickert just seemed... strange?",
            "Why did Silat need to double-take when saying Guts' name? Didn't he literally say in Golden Age 'I'll remember that name'? Pretty shitty memory",

            "The art is really good, I'm glad",

It's the only way to address all these major opponents in a timely manner.\n\nI'm still betting on an individuation process with the beast of darkness and getting a power up to the berserker armor. Then the power of friendship from his DND crew pulling him out of his slump.",

            "Given how Miura loves to repeat themes and events it's a little disquieting to me that Guts is in prison with his spirit and body broken after having a loved one leave him so suddenly.  Though the circumstances are different it's similar enough to Griffith's story that makes me think that history is about to repeat itself.  Maybe Guts will sacrifice his friends in the next big battle to get back his dream of being with Casca?\n\nAnyways, a great job by Mori and team.  I can't wait to see what's next.",
            "Could anyone possibly tell me (perhaps remind me) what Farnese is holding with her left arm on the 10th page?

            "I was very pleased with this episode. The art is great (not Miura great), and as far as the plot there was actual sense of time passing. I'm not referring to the skip of the boat to Kushan, but that there were scenes after scenes that felt like in real time would be the span of an hour or so - the episodes of Elfheim felt like they were just the span of minutes with very minimal dialogue. I'm just glad that there is a bit more depth now.",

            "I loved what studio Gaga did so far but not this chapter I have to say, because it rushes the story waaaay too much. I would have prefered two or three chapters for what it had to say.\n\nMiura didn't hesitate to draw several pages with no dialogue whatsoever, just to show architecture, people, animals, landscapes... It created the sense of a living city. Now it just feeled we teleported right into the castle and the kushan people just don't exist.\n\nWorse, the character of Silat : he says to Roderick \"I have something to discuss\" but in fact he doesn't want to chat, just stating the obvious \"fairy island vanished bla blah\", note that he doesn't even ask a question so what's the point of saying that he has something to \"discuss\" ? Also note that it's not even slightly important to him, if he's in the room, it's only because Daiba requested him to come.\n\nThen, after Daiba claimed Gut's party and convinced Silat to explain the situation to them, Silat says \"follow me\" to explain a few meters later in another random hallway. Therefore why the need to follow him ?\n\nMaybe I didn't understand something... I hope",

She is not ready to \"go to war\" right now.\n\nThey *need* a time skip, probably 8 to 10 years.",

It's not dissimilar to mirua but certainly their own in its own right.\n\nMy main gripe was mainly shading which, this chapter they have drastically improved upon. \n\nAnd is it me or did Griffith get hotter which is unreal to me.",

            "I think they hit their stride here. I was impressed by both the character and scenery art. I was always happy that studio gaga decided to continue Berserk, but this was better than expected tbh",
            "I was thinking the same thing. There was only like one Rickert face that I noticed was slightly off, otherwise everything looks pretty amazing.",
            "I was very critical of the drawings in the early chapters, but with this one and the previous one they have really come to a very good level. I would even respectfully say that they are better than some of Miura's chapters when he was still transitioning to digital drawing.",
            "Only thing that throws me off is Puck is never a chestnut \ud83c\udf30 anymore. I prefer normal Puck but Miura pretty much stopped drawing him like that for a long time.",

            "Still an overall visual downgrade but as weird as it sounds I'm almost happy about it. I mean if muira had to draw those city scapes all the little buildings in the back would be 10x as detailed and the chapter would be out in September. I've accept the new art and just really want to see the story.\u00a0",
            "the art has improved a ton as has the paneling",
            "Genuinely close to what Miura was doing during Millennium Falcon. This chapter was incredible.",
            "All they have to do to make me happy is emulate miura's godlike use of really dark shading.\n\n I thought when they drew enraged guts attacking griffith they fell short because the only actual black on the page was guts' head. Everything else was more grey or just completely white\n\nThis chapter, guts in the cell is looking very good. The shading is much more on point i think\n\n\nThe real test will be when the beast of darkness comes out next",
            "Looks incredible. The Goober patrol who complained about it were super rude to not give them time to find their feet. Hell, Miura mistepped his first steps when he made Guts F that demon chick which is super out of character. No one is perfect straight away.",
            "Could have been a scanning issue but I do agree the art is more crisp this issue. \n\nKouji\u2019s previous issues felt too white. Everything now looks defined. Obviously he can\u2019t match Miura\u2019s shading but he does a damned good job at making it look good and faithful to the original art style.\n\nAlso I enjoy Kouji\u2019s faces way more than Miura\u2019s faces",
            "Imo they are definitely better than Miura\u2019s first few digital chapters but they\u2019re not anywhere near his peak.\n\nBut it\u2019s very good yes. I think they\u2019ve improved significantly on the characters. I hope they can get Miuras poses and panel layouts down.",
            "Think giving them more time has definitely helped. Letting them put the chapters out whenever rather then to a specific schedule would\u2019ve helped a lot . Plus I\u2019m sure they prob read criticisms of the art and wanted to work harder and make it better. And they 100% have upped their game",
            "I really believe that's because this chapter was during daylight. It made all the difference.",

            "I think the slight quality drop was due to the hiatus and then Miura\u2019s passing. That probably threw a massive wrench in everything logistically and emotionally, when they got back to work they probably turned it what they had without a lot of fine-tune edits in order to keep to a schedule (\u201cshow must go on\u201d), but now that they got their groove and Mori has his routine/timetable down for what he needs and expects out of the team it\u2019s back where it\u2019s at.\u00a0",

Literally theres not point in making art better at a certain point, it's just more baggage to the overall progress\u00a0",

            "Kshatriya is part of the class system in India, the warrior class to be precise which is the upper class (the class kings and knights belong to). Durga is Durgamata, which is a divinity, seen as one of the highest manifestation. She is the embodiment of all female forms, both beautiful and terrible. In her terrible form she is known as Kali or Kalimata. She is the combination of the female forms of the Trinity (Parvati, Lakshmi, Saraswati, the female forms of Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma) and, which leads to the context of Berserk, she is known as the Slayer of demons. Both mighty, beautiful and terrible, she triumphs even the greatest of Gods (the Maha deva, greatest deity Shiva himself). \n\nGuts being called the warrior of the demon slaying Goddess is quite fitting though I am wondering if this will lead to anything further. Daiba also mentioned Serpico as warrior of Vayu (the powerful vedic god of Wind of which Hanuman was an incarnation according to Hindu lore, probably because of his cloak and weapon) and Isidro as the warrior of Agni (vedic god of the sacrificial fire, because of his dagger).",

In order to ensure that this final battle isn't just the Kushan getting steamrolled, Gaga have probably A) mapped out the size to be India across to Turkey, and B) chosen Istanbul as the capital both because of the iconic Hagia Sophia (which we see in the chapter), and the fact that it's a very defendable location - possibly one of the most defendable in history (it's why the Romans initially founded Byzantion at that location in the first place). \n\nThe final battle is absolutely going to be the Kushan holding out at their capital (Istanbul to us).

That results in Zodd turning coats and helping the Black Swordsman Party in their war against the Godhand - with his objective being either to break his curse (which logically comes to thought when Void, the one who does the ceremony of sacrifices, dies, or something to that effect) or die (**in combat)** trying.",

And by most, I mean vast vast majority. \n\nMost people just don't have the critical thinking skills or honesty to look deeper. They are content with the \"outer beauty\". \n\nJust look at this USA election as an example. Trump, a huge moron. And his opponent? Biden, who was once also a moron. Now, he is literally brain dead. \n\nA brain dead idiot who was a moron before his brain rotted away, vs another moron. And these two are the most popular.",

            "Indeed, the boat trip was very gray, which I think was due to the cloudy weather and the lack of light inside the boat since they had to depart in a hurry. In Chapter 375, there are more light sources from torches used by the Kushan, as well as more reflective material, such as Kushan armor, resulting in generally more well-lit panels. In Chapter 376, we see more contrast with black in the cell because the only light source is a small window above Guts.  \nI don't deny that the art style improved, but I think the lighting from Chapter 370 onwards was more of an artistic decision rather than a consistent improvement.",
            "I think Daiba is training Schierke to absurd levels, along with more Flora appearances and some lore leak of the Proto Godhand and past Skull Knight/Gaiseric events.\n\nRemember how Flora stated the Brand of Sacrifice isn't something definitive but rather just atrociously strong magic that even she couldn't undo? Maybe with a lot of training from the notably strong Daiba, Schierke can improve her magic to levels like that.",

            "I think so, because Silat doesnt actually ask for the name, just pretends to barely remember it.\nAnd Puck doesnt answer to Isidro when he asks if he seriously doesnt remember Rickert.\nI think that is just a case of mutual distrust from both parties, considering the 2 empires have been mortal enemis throughout the whole manga.",

Or how you have to sacrifice your loved ones to become an apostle/God Hand member. \n\nDoes Sonia even know what an apostle is? Does she know Griffith is one of the \"angels\" from the Abyss? I feel like Sonia just think of Griffith and the apostles as people with strange powers, not monsters who have sacrificed their loved ones to gain their power. Not so many people in the world of Berserk understand the nature of being an apostle.",

Do you think Donald Trumpists don\u2019t know he is a crook and a disgusting human being, completely unfit to rule even a bathroom seat?\n\nIn some level they know this.

It's a meme used to bait people who feel passionate about the series or as a joke because of how untrue it is.\n\nNow, there are some people who do believe \"Griffith did what a lot of people would do in that situation\" and may be using \"nothing wrong\" as a short hand/poor articulation.\n\nI do think there is something to be said about everything that led Griffith to that point and how many people in that same position would actually do anything differently than him.\n\nWhile I'm sure everyone likes to believe they'd reject the offer to sacrifice, I know I'm certain I wouldn't do it to my loved ones. How certain I'd be after being tortured for a year by that little gremlin shit after losing all ambition and ability to exist free and on my own, and relying on a person I see as a betrayer to me to continue the meager existence that is my new life of agony? \n\nI don't know what would be going through my mind then. I sure hope I'm better than griffirh. (Note I'm not saying Griffiths feelings are correct, just outlining what they are. They're wretched because Griffith is a bad person.) \n\nMany people don't think straight after an upsetting week, let alone a full year of agony. Now have that person who has lost everything but the ability to painfully breathe and require constant aid and care whinwas ne a very successful and talented person, and offer him not just a full restoration of his health and being, but also the closest thing to Godhood he can imagine? All while being manipulated and gaslit by fellow \"gods\" to join them at his lowest and weakest state.\n\nThe truth to it all is that Griffith did everything wrong, but there's a lot of wrong people in the world who would do the same thing, especially after going through what Griffith did.",
            "Not saying he did nothing wrong, all I say is his decision  was understandable. It was not an easy decision to make. In the end he decided to sacrifice everyone for his sake. U can say that's Evil, OK. But I cannot really hate him just because of that decision & knowing what tortures he went through and his physical condition make me wonder what we would gave done if in his shoes. \n\nDoing what he did to casca was too much though. To this day I still don't really get it. Why was that necessary? Maybe it was a godhand thing. But if that was just Griffith doing it, way out of character imo ngl.",

            "I think it\u2019s a valid point for a few reasons. We\u2019re constantly shown the worst of humanity through berserk, including Guts. By comparison to the atrocities we\u2019ve seen other characters do, he really hasn\u2019t done anything that bad. The only thing people seem to have against him is assaulting Casca and sacrificing the Band; but both of that was after he was supernaturally transformed into a fucking Demon. The actual Griffith rescued Casca from that very situation in the past. And, as much as I like them, the Band did pledge their lives to battle and Griffith. I don\u2019t see it as any different from them dying in some pointless mercenary skirmish (which again, Griffith seems to have done much more than any other military leader to try to prevent needless deaths).\n\nHe is my favorite character and I guess my reasoning relies on separating Griffith from Femto, but even then I acknowledge he didn\u2019t do *anything* wrong; he has flaws, but I don\u2019t hate him like most the fandom seems to.",

People understand Griffith wasnt all there when he S.A. the princess (kinda like what happened w Casca)\n\nThey focus so much on Griffith they unironically ignore Donovan, Wyald, Snake Apostles and the little insect girl (all involve violence against children) and the Genocidal Rapist Genishka (defeated by Griffith) who used pregnant woman to corrupt their unborn to create demon soldiers.\n\nAs for why he did nothing wrong\n\nHe created a Utopia that is used to protect all humans affected by the actions of Genishka (merging both worlds)\n\nHe stopped needless war between humans and provides a place where they can live happily \n\nHe subjugated the Apostles and forbid them from eating/harming humans.

            "Well, i am not a troll and i am really on the side of griffith. To say he did nothing wrong is a bit much, but i think he had less of a choice. I think the loss of Guts hit him incredible hard. Guts were his only real friend and not just that he left him behind but also he looked at him full of pity after they rescured him after 1 year of torturing. \n\nI think Guts is not \"the good guy\" in this stoty and Griffith is not the bad guy either, it's not that simple and that's what berserk makes such a great story. \n\nGriffith did a lot of good decisions for the falcons, he even went in bed with that gross king to get the support without his men being in danger. \n\nIn the moment before the eclipse begun, he was about to kill himself, Blood hit the Behelith and his friends came close to him while he wanted to shout them to stop - but he couldn't. \n\nWhat happend was destiny, deep unchangeable destiny, it couldn't be any different from the moment he got the crimson behelith. There were no mean plan of him to lead anyone in this gruesome fate. I doubt that he was fully aware of what exactly will happen - but he might got the idea and that why he wanted them to stay away, but everyone came to him when the blood hits the behelith.\n\n  \nWell, what he did then to casca is nothing what i want to defend and i think who sais she enjoyed it might be really a troll. but I think griffith this this maintainly to punish guts. In this moment he was no human anymore. it was not griffith, but femto. You can not turn to one of the godhand and expect to have the same point of morality like before\n\nCascas position is difficult as well, there was a moment of decision, right after they rescued griith when she could decide to  go with guts or stay with griffith and take care of him. She couldn't left him. She choosed to stay with griffith and it was this moment of pity which griffith saw.",

Casca lost every single thing in that eclipse.\n\nSo even if anyone justifies Griffith making world as better place, stopping wars and new world with collateral damage of sacrifice. They can't justify Griffith's action towards Casca",

            "Way out of character? Imo it sounds like you don't understand his character. I agree that ultimately his decision of whether to sacrifice his band to regain his strength and ability to chase his dream, after a year of torture that left him completely disabled, would be a difficult decision for most people. At that point he didn't have any good options, although, I think in the moment where he said \"I sacrifice\" he was getting pleasure from the idea of sacrificing all of his friends for his own gain. It would be a difficult decision for most people and is somewhat understandable, but Griffith isn't like most people. He was gleeful in his decision.\n\nHe did what he did to Casca not because his heart was frozen when he became Femto, but because as a human what always mattered most to him was having power and control over other people. It's why he hated Guts for leaving him, it's why he slept with Charlotte, and it's why he taunted the king leading to his year of torture. He tried to force himself on Casca once already, in the wagon. It was revenge on Guts and a way to establish his sense of control and power over both Guts and Casca. Which is totally in character for him. Imo at least",
            "He wanted Casca and he wanted Guts and he wanted the life that they may have had together for himself. He perversely stole everything he could from them because he wanted what they had. That\u2019s all it is. He wanted, wanted and wanted. And he took it. That\u2019s all there was. We can argue its symbolism but that was his pretense.\u00a0",

            "He was psychologically damaged from being tortured for a year straight and the influence of the godhand at that point. And I\u2019m still willing to admit that was egotistical of him, but again, far from the worst we\u2019ve seen in berserk.\n\nHonestly I think that was more about him just wanting the past back more than anything, he knew casca was into him and wanted to feel that again. Not defending it, just saying. I think that\u2019s part of the point of Femto doing it too, a dark inversion for his ascension.",

You are completely wrong taking Femto\u2019s actions as Griffith\u2019s.  \n\nRegarding the sacrifice, I am confident to say that every human given the choice to abandon mortality and become a higher being, would do so without looking twice at the price he/she has to pay.\n\nAnyone of those who were given a behelit ever turned down becoming an apostle. Then again, Griffith did nothing wrong, for every human would do the same.",
            "Basically it's two guys not telling each other what they really mean or want..because guys don't talk about these things to each other.",
            "I also differentiate between griffith and femto but this doesn't work here, because the majority doesn't, not even guts does. \n\nI also don't differentiate them as two completely separate beings, just as an altered being. Griffith also tried to force himself on casca befor the eclipse but wasn't able to do so. Him raping casca was a direct consequence of what Griffith wanted to do.\n\n\"Griffith did nothing wrong\" is especially used by people who defend rape. If you want to be be associated with those, then this is on you. But as I said, if you think killing all your loved ones isn't wrong, then there isn't much to talk about. Don't apply your own standard onto others, apparently you would have done the same but that's just it. The statement \"griffith did nothing wrong\" is wrong in itself.",
            "Lol yeah",
            "Well I do consider Femto and Griffith as completely different beings, even if Guts nor the majority here does not, because I think that was the autor\u2019s intention all along.\n\nYou think Femto raped Casca because Griffith wanted to force himself on her? I think Femto no longer feels any kind of lust and the raping had absolutely nothing to do with earthly desires. It was him testing the reach of his newborn being, exploring how far could he break into humans idea of evil. He raped casca just because he could, and that has nothing to do with how wrongful raping is for us humans. \n\nI think that if any of us, you or me, were given the choice of leaving our mortality behind, we would take it. No matter what were the cost. If you say you wouldn\u2019t, I think you are either lying to me or to yourself.",
            "Well okey this is just sad. I hope you are just 15 or something like this.\n\nThis really shows why people who defend griffith are indeed problematic in social matters and not just some trolls."

So much so that Guts leaving made him spiral.\n\nNot to excuse what he did at all, but Guts was the one person to make him forget, to make him ok with never reaching his dream....he's the one person who, not being his equal, wasn't a deal-breaker for being his friend. \n\nIn this panel I see Guts, happy Griffith got what he wanted, but ultimately unfulfilled, and Griffith happy that his friend got him to where he was, having no idea Guts felt how he felt. \n\nIt's ultimately tragic because there is an outcome here where Griffith gets what he wants and so does Guts, but it's never discussed, neither think they can.",
            "Are you talking about the Zodd fight? I do concede that he risked his life but in my view he did it because he thought they could kill him. If Griffith truly knew how invulnerable Zodd was, he might not have risked his life to that degree, that's my view anyway.\n\nIf you're referring to something else then by all means.\n\nI said \"obedient lackey\" because that's what Griffith seemed like he wanted when he was furious about Guts leaving and he was even willing to kill him rather than let him go. A friend doesn't do that and even if he wasn't a friend (which I mantain he wasn't considering his speech to the princess) if he even cared a little bit about Guts then he wouldn't have considered doing that.",
            "Who was top and who was bottom in Guts and Griffith's marriage?",
            "Well he saw all those bodies Zodd left behind. He knew that even Guts couldn't stand straight after meeting that monster. I actually think that Griffith didn't think at all at this moment, he just went for it, because it was Guts who he was so eager to protect. Any sane commander, especially the one who seeks only his dreams, would leave the scene, yet he was ready to die only for Guts alone. \n\nI just don't think he felt nothing towards Guts. And i also think that fandom is too trusting about something Griffith says. He once told Casca that he didn't make his dying comrades follow him, yet he's self harming. He tells Charlotte that nothing is more precious for him than his dream, yet he completely abandones his dream when it's Guts we're talking about, he's ready to die, that's what i call abandoning a dream. People don't usually say as they feel. I personally think he wanted Guts to be just a soldier to him, but never achieved this want. You can see it in every little scene with them, even in the page OP posted: there are so many people around Griffith, noble, rich, powerful, but the one he's looking and smiling at is Guts. This is literally the last time when he smiles to someone sincerely with sparkles in his eyes or whatever. You won't see it again in the whole manga. Just a little fact i noticed. \n\nMaybe it was too long, sorry, i just think that we often underestimate Griffith before Eclipse. He's scary and cruel, but he is a human, who seeks compassion and  acceptance even in his own cruel doings. Because it is a  human nature. Look at how he asks Guts (after murdering the queen): \"Do you think I'm cruel?\" And Guts just casually replies something like \"Nah i get it, I've done worse\", and just look. Look into his eyes. He hates himself for his comrades' deaths, for Gennon, for everything, and Guts just accepts him. Not Casca, who got scared as hell at the sight of Griffith's breakdown after Gennon, not anyone else. This is one of the reasons why they formed such a strong bond. \n\nAnd, i mean, how can we even consider that he never cared for Guts after \"You are the only one who made me forget my dream\" monologue? Sure Femto-Griffith is a senseless jerk. But before he was Femto, he had feelings, he was just a person, who wanted to be strong enough, but was made weak by Guts and their friendship (and maybe something more). This is why at the Eclipse we see his \"last tear\", as he loses his human nature, and this is why all that Griffith and Guts duo is so tragic.",
            "Griffith is top Guts is bottom obviously",
            "I agree with this, and that's what makes the showdown where Guts beats Griffith and leaves so tragic. If Griffith had been willing to speak instead of cross swords, if he'd just said that no matter what Guts heard or thought, they were partners in this thing together to the end, that he needed his best friend at his side, and just asked him not to leave...\n\nThat's all he'd have needed to do. Just be forthright instead of pushing away his feelings and trying to force his will.",
            "While I'm willing to agree that Griffith had \"feelings\" for people, for Guts specially, before the torture/Eclipse, my personal view is that his selfishness, pettiness, callousness and his anger at things not going his way represent much more of what he is than his other more humane parts.\n\nOne of the reasons why I've always thought he was a truly evil man before the Eclipse is his attitude near the beginning of the Golden Age, when Corkus and the other soldiers try to rob Guts. Rather than dissuading them or ordering them not to attack an innocent man, he kept quiet. You could even make the argument that he knew Guts was strong (since he was him fighting in the castle before) and deliberately threw his men to their deaths for a chance at making Guts one of his own. While he got what he wanted, his actions speak volumes as to his character and his morals.",
            "This. If only he spoke to Guts, just said a few effing words to him, _nothing_ would've happen. Well maybe god hand still got to them, blah blah casualty, but the old witch told our skull man that fate is like a spiral and the young aren't obligated to follow the same path. This is so sad chat.",
