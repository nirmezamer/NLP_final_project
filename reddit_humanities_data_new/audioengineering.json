I plugged the microphone, I downloaded and installed the drivers, I turned the Audio interface ON (of course), but for some reason no sound comes out of it from the headphones. I selected the mic output correctly because I can clearly see from the settings that the audio is coming out of it (the audio bar receives sound), and I tried selecting the playback as an OUT of the interface, but even if I select my own monitor as an audio output, I can't hear anything. I even recorded it thinking that perhaps I can't hear the sound at the same time, but nothing comes out of it, only a distant and very faint whistle. Any help..?",

            "I've always had issues with lots of noise when using my Shure SM7B. It's never really been too much of an issue since I would just use the noise compressor filter with OBS, but l've recently started using it more for singing and the noise compressor filter loves to cut out a lot when holding notes. Because of this, I can't record with it, but if I don't use it I get constant and very noticeable noise. The microphone is quiet so l have to bump up the gain to 26 (which is the most OBS lets me) but ofc that bumps up the noise as well. I've tried combatting it in Premiere Pro and Adobe Audition with various filters and effects but they all have some very noticeable draw back like making me sound like I'm underwater or making the audio scratchy bc its too loud. A few months ago I saw something about the mic not being plugged in right, so I fiddled with it and plugged it into a few different USB slots in my desktop which helped but only the tiniest bit. My microphone also seems to be a lot quieter ever since then for some reason; I used to be audible but now every quiet sound effect like opening up a new tab seems to overtake my voice. I've tried using a cloud lifter, and maybe I didn't use it correctly, but it didn't seem to work. I haven't seen almost anyone with this same issue, and every video I see on it seems to work extremely well with no noise right out of the box. If anyone can help me, please explain your solution to me like you're talking to a 3 year old, as I have next to know knowledge about audio and different audio terms. I'd send a clip of what it sounds like but it won't let me attatch a video :/",
            "Hi friends, the time has come for me to expand the studio. I am currently doing 2.1 with KRK Rokit 5's and KRK 10S. I'm considering 5.1.2 or 5.1.4. I have questions. If you are kind enough to reply, please feel free to reply to any combination of these.\n\n1. Are there other brands of speakers that compliment the KRK Rokit's or ones that I should avoid due to different tonal characteristics? I've read I could just get an additional Rokit5 and turn it sideways for the center?\n2. Is there practical arguments to be made for or against in-ceiling vs on-ceiling speakers?\n3. My home office is 14' x 8.5' with 8.5' ceilings. Does this make it impractical to go for 5.1.4? FWIW, I will be here for at least 5 more years, if not more, and we own the space so holes in the ceiling are A-OK.\n4. I have an Audiobox 1818VSL I purchased in 2018 that I'm pretty sure is going to do the job here, but I'm open to looking into any other recommendations from y'all for a newer audio interface. I constantly switch between my Macbook (with 2 OP docks lol), PC (has SPDIF out, and 3.5 inputs for Rear, C/Sub, Mic in, Line out, and Line in), and my LG C3 42\" for reference and casual media watching.\n\nI am currently using a 15-year-old Audiobox USB and just moving the USB between PC and Mac when needed - it's not compatible with my TV but looking forward to better mixes when I finally get this 1818VSL set up in this space!

            "Hi!\n\nI need some help into trying to get a decent recorded audio from [this mixer](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/15068/Behringer-Eurorack-Mx802a.html#manual) into a computer while reserving the main output for an amplifier.\n\nThe goal is to record the audio input from the microphones of conferences which have to be amplified in a room full of people at the same time of the recording.\n\nAs i said the MAIN OUT is connected to the stereo, and after doing some research i thought the most effective way to record the input would have been connecting the TAPE OUT (like the main out but with flat volume) of the mixer directly to the PC. The problem is it doesn't record well at all. It's still better than what we used before sometimes but, depending on the mic, how far one talks to the microphone etc the noise is still sometimes incomprehensible, even after high passing, compressing and normalizing loudness to -16LUFS in post production.\n\nI don't really know what i can do next, perhaps i should check the microphones (they are all pretty old) and the equalization on the mixer, but i'm not sure i might achieve a better quality if the TAPE OUT > PC isn't a good set up on its own. I would like to achieve a podcast level type of sound, not a super high quality, ultra crisp and clear sound, but just a nice sound that can be listened to comfortably for more than an hour.",

            "Hi everyone. Is there a sensible way I can easily switch between 3 studio monitors? I have a home studio and have just added a DJ setup in the same room to the left of my studio desk.

Everything is battery-powered, and we walk the gear into local woodlands, so low weight, low power draw, and small size are important, as is cost.\n\n**Issues:**\n\n1. **Loudness Matching:**\u00a0The XDJ's dB meter is good, but we need a consistent readout of perceived volume. The TC ELECTRONIC Clarity M looks ideal but costs \u00a3260, and needs an optical converter. It draws 6W, which is fine but lower would be better.\n2. **DSP/EQ:**\u00a0The Behringer FBQ8000 EQ is okay, but my unit's connections are dodgy (need to open and solder/fix) and its outputs are unbalanced. I\u2019m considering a small programmable EQ. I have a Focusrite Scarlett Solo but prefer not to take a laptop into the woods.\n\nI love the 9 bands and +-12dB range on the FBQ800, which sits at the front of the DJ table for easy tweaking. I considered the Douk Audio T8 PRO for its XLR in/out and sexy tubes, but its 25W draw and +-6dB range aren\u2019t ideal.\n\n**My Research/Guess:**\u00a0Sticking with/fixing the FBQ is the easiest option.\n\nThe 'best' improvement might be using a laptop to monitor loudness and set EQ, perhaps with a MIDI controller for easier EQ control. Maybe use a phone as a small monitor to see loudness and EQ bands with the laptop closed (laptop might draw 25W? Ryzen 4800H, no GPU). But this is complex.\n\nA higher cost option is buying the Clarity M with an optical converter.\n\n**Summary:**\u00a0I\u2019m looking for suggestions on a small, low power, in-line EQ/DSP and loudness meter.

            "# Focusrite Octopre to PreSonus 1824c with Mac - Tons of hissing, static, video game sound noise on both monitoring and playback\n\n  \nHi there!\n\n\n\nI've scoured the Googles and I'm dumbfounded to see this combo hasn't been mentioned very often but I'll try to be as concise as possible here. I just purchased the Focusrite Octopre 8 channel mic preamp and hooked it up via ADAT optical into my PreSonus 1824c audio interface via a MacBookPro going into the Studio One 6 DAW.\n\nI'm tracking drums, so I'm using 8 channels from the Octopre and 2 channels from the 1824c. My IEM are connected to the PreSonus 1824c 1/4\" headphone jack.\n\nI've set the Octopre's clock to \"Internal\" at 44khz, set the PreSonus 1824c to 44khz via Universal Control, and have set the Mac Audio Midi Setup to 44khz with both Input and Output. (Side note, when I attempt to do all of these at 48khz, Mac's Audit Midi Setup auto-switches this back to 44khz for some reason.))\n\nMy problem here is that, when I start up Studio One and play back audio that I've recorded, it sounds like those super old NES game audio. I can get this to go away by closing Studio One entirely, then reopening - which temporarily it stops. (However, there still exists some unwanted audio artifacts.)\n\nThe best case scenario here is that when the 1824c monitoring volume is about at 12 o'clock I hear this faint hissing in the background, the recorded audio sounds fair.\n\nWorst case scenario is that the both the straight monitoring of the mics (via drum hits) sounds like blown out speakers for each drum hit. And then during playback it sounds like super old NES music.\n\nI'm at a loss here. When I was using the 1824c by itself, it was totally fine. No hissing when the monitor volume was up, no weird NES sounds from the mics etc. everything was totally solid.\n\nSince I've hooked up the Octopre it's been a nightmare and I don't know what to do.\n\nLast thing I'll say and then I'll shut up is that... It's FRIDAY and I just want to make some music and I'm in fetal position crying because everything sounds like garbage, and both Focusrite and PreSonus support isn't open until Monday.\n\nPLEASE HELP (and hopefully this helps any future travelers!)",

It is a fuzzy digital distortion that sounds very much like a bit crusher. Very similar to the distortion problems described by other users having problems with Windows 11. I finally ran LatencyMon, and there are several drivers that are presenting absolutely stratospheric latency values, even when NO audio is being played over the device output. These values seem to get better if I unplug my USB interface from the USB port, but I still get a message saying that my system isn't set up to deal with real-time audio processing.\n\nThe following drivers are presenting problems in LatencyMon: \n\nDrivers Tab:   https://imgur.com/oknTd4R\nMain Tab:  https://imgur.com/a/PlYP26I\n\nLatencyMon message: \n\n''Your system appears to be having trouble handling real-time audio and other tasks. You are likely to experience buffer underruns appearing as drop outs, clicks, or pops. One or more DPC routine that belong to a driver running in your system appear to be executing for too long. Also, one or more ISR routines that belong to a driver running in your system appear to be executing for too long. At least one detected problem appears to be network related. In case you are using a WLAN adapter, try disabling it to get better results. One problem may be related to power management, disable CPU throttling settings in Control Panel, and Bios setup. Check for BIOS updates.''\n\nHow can a network adapter be the problem? This isn't a reasonable solution, as I also use audio applications while surfing the internet, like Youtube, Spotify, etc. Am I expected to simply sacrifice the ability to watch anything while on the internet while playing audio?\n\n**I've tried**:\n\n- reinstalling USB interface drivers several times, rolling back driver\n- changing the ASIO buffer size, changing sample rate, and bit-depth\n- updating window several times\n- updating system through Lenovo automatic update on the website\n- gone through every possible tweak setting for optimizing audio in Windows 11\n- tried different power and battery settings\n- tried all updates and troubleshooting audio through Lenovo Vantage and Commercial Vantage\n- checked BIOS update \n\n**What I've found**:\n\n- messing with USB device ASIO buffer settings seems to solve the problem temporarily while distortion is happening\n- changing output settings from USB device to laptop speakers, then back to USB output seems to work temporarily\n- opening Lenovo Vantage seems to have an effect on when distortion starts (I opened Vantage and distortion immediately started)\n\nI also found that something might be wrong with my battery settings, as Smart Charge over Lenovo Vantage settings seem to change randomly, without having changed anything. Battery was set to stop charging at 85% and resume at 75%, but it was stuck at 84% even though the settings were applied. It's also worth pointing out that I encountered a weird error in Lenovo Commercial Vantage, saying that one of the battery driver was missing. I tried installing the driver manually, and got a message saying that all drivers were already up-to-date. The message eventually disappeared, and now the battery issues continue, were the battery level just stays at ''fully smart charged'', even though it's supposed drain until it reaches the lower threshold, then charge back up.\n\nI found forums where people are saying this might be a CPU problem related to core configuration, however, this is beyond my expertise and I'm afraid of messing up my laptop even further. I've run out of options and feel like I'm on a wild goose chase. The laptop is brand new and I shouldn't be having all these issues playing audio over an USB interface. What are my options? The folks over at Lenovo suggest downgrading to Windows 10 (suggested by Lenovo Support), but this seems like an unreasonable solution.\n\nAny help is much appreciated, as I've hit a brick wall. I am deeply frustrated, as nobody seems to have a solution that doesn't involve doing something crazy, like downgrading, or tweaking CPU settings, which seems risky.\n\nI'm almost throwing my laptop out the window and buying a mac :)\n\nThank you!",
            "Are iLoud Micros still the best in their class?\n\nI've been eyeing the\u00a0iLoud\u00a0Micros for years, and now that I have a proper job, I can finally afford them. When I last checked a few years ago, they were pretty much unrivaled as small form active monitors --or rather consumer+ grade speakers that can also be used as monitors, especially if you're okay with mixing on headphones and/or can't do acoustic treatment, which I am.\n\nThat said, there's a huge price difference between the Micros and their competitors: budget offerings from PreSonus, Behringer, Swissonic that can also be used as desktop speakers in their 4\" form, priced between \u20ac100-175. Edifier MR4 has great reviews&measurements and goes for \u20ac99, there's also competition from JBL 104 for \\~\u20ac200, KRK GoAux 3\" for \u20ac190, even Yamaha has 3\" (\u20ac230) and 4\" (\u20ac270) models still cheaper. Current common price for iLoud MM seems to be \u20ac299, but it looks like IK may go for another hike as it's \u20ac350 on their store. I don't remember the price difference being anything like this before, feels like the competition got cheaper and more diversified while Micros got more expensive.\n\nMy main problem is that the reliable sources for reviews are still heavily focused on high-end, while most recommend iLoud MM as the bare minimum/small form option, they're outdated and do not account for the iLoud price hike, and Yamaha/KRK have weirdly no reviews. From what I've gathered, it looks like Edifier MR4 provides the best value (maybe even the best quality compared to budget monitors) at that size/price point, but cannot reach to iLoud for sound quality. JBL 104 also underperforms, so does KRK GoAux 3 (literally just 1 review), but no comparisons exist for Yamaha HS4.\n\nI'd greatly appreciate if anyone can offer any thoughts or resources on this!\n\nNotes for autorepliers:\n\n* I know headphones are the best for untreated mixing, I already do this, this will be for complimentary listening and multimedia use, I still heavily favor a flat sound profile.\n* JBL305P MK2: yeah they're great for price, but I definitely do not have the space for them.

            "Hi,\nI have some trouble understanding the huge price range of microphones. On the one end, there is, for instance, the AT 2020 which costs like 80-90\u20ac and, afaik, has been used in professional audio production that hit the charts (I think, there first album by Billie Eilish had the vocals recorded with one of these...).\nI totally understand what the a piece increase up to 10x gets you. Pads, filters, flexible patterns and audio probably better built quality and a better capsule. The LCT 640 would be an example here. \nBut what justifies the price for something like a U87 (2,5k\u20ac) and then a U67 (7k\u20ac). What parts make these so expensive? Or do they just have the electronics so well figured out that they deliver a superior frequency response characteristic? Something else? \n\nTo be clear: I'm not looking to buy a mic, I'm very happy with my AT2020. I can understand that there are settings in which the extra features of lewitt come in handy.

            "I'm just a Mechtronic Enginnering Technician, but it sounds like a design issue to me - needing to reboot points to a firmware/DSP issue, or possibly losing driver sync.\n\nSeriously dude, return it and buy something used. Theres just no case where something like that is worth it. If you can be bothered to tell tell me what you can find for the same money, i'll help choose something better",

            "its not about telling apart, its about matched sets for multichannel, and about engineers and artists being able to go from studio to studio, across the hall or across the world, and get identical results reliably. In general the best gear is the gear you know like the back of your hand.\n\nIf youre talking about the difference between the U67 and U87, they both have the incredible manufacturing tolerances, but the U67 has a complicated valve pre-amp that runs at hundreds of volts and hand wound transformers, the U87 is a FET with simple to make cct. With either you definitely pay for the Neumann name and heritage manufacturing techniques. (Honestly something i dont have a need for, personally)",
            "I cannot return it anymore. Yesterday was the last day for me to do so, but I kept searching around for technicians and eats to fix it, since I really don't want another one.\n\n\nI don't have enough money to buy another one, even if used, and nor am I planning to sell this one in this condition, so to fix it it is.",
            "Ok, I'm already getting smarter, thanks! \n\nBut what I still struggle with is: you say, they need to match in a multichannel setting and when switching studios. I get that. But if one cannot tell apart two of them in an a/b test (maybe you can, but most people cannot), isn't that a contradiction? \nAnd, assuming that also 800\u20ac mics are quite well built, wouldn't other differences in the setup across studios (preamps, converters etc) have a higher impact than two 800\u20ac vs. two 7000\u20ac mics?",
            "Did you consider telling them it has an issue, and asking nicely if they can help?",

            "Mhm, I have. And they kindly said no.\n\n\nAccording to them one of the issues may be a bad capacitor caused by using the volume too high/using a dynamic mic in the port because it's meant for condenser mics (in my defense, the manual straight up says \"MIC\" without specifying which one it Is).",
            "You're right, I'm not. I'm an amateur and considering my skills (singing, editing, mixing etc) and the very limited time I have to produce and improve those skills, it's not my gear that limits my results \ud83d\ude09\n\nThis is why I asked for opinions of more professionals. And I thank you for providing it!",
            "Honestly, its a kind of dumb thing to buy for a home studio, imho - unless you are a pro muso and basically made of money and just dont wanna think about what to buy (ie Rihanna).

It's either too harsh or too dark\n\nIt's also pretty noisy IMO (surprisingly because it's supposed to only have 9db (A) of self noise using an RME UCX II preamp and I often find myself in RX trying to remove some of the hiss so it doesn't pump up with compression \n\nAny recommendations on other mics that have a modernly bright but not harsh high end? \n\nAnd for those owning an OC818 have you noticed the same things?

I have 40 cm thick bass trap clouds, panels on the sides, corners, and in front of my desk + a few at the back: I'm talking about hiss in the background of the recording (not sure that comes from ambient room noise)  \n\nYeah I was wondering about people who have both the oc818 and C414 about their experiences \n\nI just listened to Lewitt's pure tube audio examples and it's also pronounced in that area, maybe a tad smoothed but still to bright IMO\n\nwhat's your favorite vocal mic?",
            "Yeah i'm sure",
            "Yeah white noise is everywhere, when you take all the noises and all their reflections that everything makes in a city, it all blends together into white noise. Being in a shared building ith whooshing ventilation etc will make things worse. Theres not a great deal you can do about that without building a suspended room in a room (ie an isolation booth) and even that will only do so much (literally be cheaper to rent a room in the country, too).\n\nThe one thing you can do is use pickup pattern and the inverse square law to your advantage. Make sure you (emitting the signal and blocking the noise) cover as much of the pickup angle of the mic as possible by using a mic with as tight  as pattern as possible, and being as close as practical. \n\nMy favorite mic is probably the C414 XLII, my fave vocal mic is probably the Electrovoice RE20, but theres no mic thats going to be right for everything, and honestly i dont own either as my home studio just isnt good enough for the C414, and i dont need the Re20 sound (and modular synths cost too much lol). Honestly my fave mic on \\_my\\_ voice is an AKG D5, had it a long time and know how to use it. I have technically better mics, it just suits my boomy, somewhat nasal voice.",

            "If you\u2019re hellbent on not spending a single more dollar then I\u2019d find a place in front of the kit where the rhode picks up the bass drum and enough of the toms, experiment with a spaced pair overheads with the 58s, and 57 on snare.
