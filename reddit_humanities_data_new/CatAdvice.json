        "content": "My cat suddenly got very weak over the last month. Not being able to jump high, not eating much, having bathroom problems. We took her to the vet almost every  two days for the last couple weeks.\nYesterday I heard her screaming at 5am outside(my dad let her out and she didn't want to come back in) I ran outside and she couldn't move. After putting her in her bed she calmed down. She still wasn't able to move basically at all.\n\nWe took her to a specialist and we where told she most likely has cancer and won't survive. The most humane thing to do was to put her to sleep. After about an hour of her being there I was told she has gotten worse and has very little chance of survival.\nI felt like I had to put her to sleep.\nWhen I saw her she had things like IV's on her and a mask helping her breath.\n\nAs they did it I saw she started to cry.\nAnd it's that. I know that what I did was the most reasonable thing. But I can't get the image of her eyes watering out of my head.\nI don't know what I'm expecting from this post. I just had to put this somewhere.\nI feel horrible everytime I think of her.",

            "If it helps, I did a quick google and cats don\u2019t cry tears for emotional reasons but because of medical ones. The best I can understand from what I read is it was related to her health issues. So it doesn\u2019t mean she was upset about what was happening or that you were wrong.",
            "I'm sorry for your loss. It's especially hard when it happens so suddenly... cats are so horribly good at hiding their illness.\u00a0\n\n\nIf it helps...\n\n\nVocalizations, running/ fighting, and tears are a common part of the euthanization process and don't signify any pain from the cat.\u00a0\n\n\nI think you're protecting your human experience onto her. As another poster said, cats don't cry because of emotions, their tears are purely a physical reaction. And that injection to her was the same as any other needle in her life,\u00a0 not any more significant or scary.\n\n\nIt was only scary to you who knew what was happening. But for her, she was sick and in pain, and then she wasn't.\u00a0\n\n\nWhenever you remember that moment, try to remember 3 good times with her as vividly as you can. We need to do that to overcome the inherent negativity bias in our brains.\u00a0",
            "I am so sorry for your loss. You absolutely did the hardest but kindest thing you could for your kitty. \n\nI also get you. I made the mistake of looking at my kitty Peanut when they gave her the shot, and it broke my heart. So I've learned: if you have to do this again* ask to hold your pet and close your eyes. Tell them you love them, and let your touch and voice be the last thing they experience.\n\n*I said after Peanut that she was the last cat I would have ... and then a month later, I was crying, \"I need a cat!\" My family adopted rescued kitten brothers off of Craiglist, and they were the best. It didn't mean I had forgotten Peanut -- it meant I loved cats and wanted them in my life.",
            "I am so sorry.  But I think cats eyes do not water quite the way humans do, so it wasn\u2019t the sadness/fear so much as illness.  \n\nYou did the right thing not making her suffer.  Try to take solace in that.",
            "I don't know if this will help but I will share my experience. My Kagemusha was eleven when I saw blood in his box. I took him to the vet and they called me to tell me he had a mass in his stomach. The vet said that he probably would not survive surgery and I finally came to the conclusion that it was better to let him go. \n\nI will always be grateful to the vet and their staff. I went down to the vet and they put me in a room where I could play with him for as long as I wished. In the past Kagi would be terrified to go to the vet and would often shit himself. But when I saw him he was alert and happy. He came up to me and I held him in my arms and we just spent about half an hour playing and cuddling. I felt like he was telling me that he knew what was happening and he was telling me it was right and ok. Finally I called the vet tech in and she gave me the option to leave or to be there. I chose to hold him in my arms. She gave him the shot and I just held him as he went. I was in tears. I held him for awhile and then handed him over to the tech. \n\nMy belief is that your cat knew that you were doing what was best and the crying was involuntary. I am sorry for your loss. You did right.",
            "oh my god i\u2019m so sorry. i had a similar experience with my own kitten who fell very sick & i know it must be heartbreaking for you rn. grieving is a long and tough process. if you\u2019d like, you can make a little memorial corner for her.",
            "I'm so sorry, reading this absolutely broke my heart.",
            "I would guess that was related to her health. Kitties show their distress differently than us. My girl has cancer right now, one of her side effects at the moment is that her eye tears up due to where it is located, but this isn\u2019t related to pain itself.",
            "All the strength in the world to you. As others have said it\u2019s normal for this to happen during the process, and doesn\u2019t indicate emotion. \n\nYou did what was best for your kitty, try and take comfort in that if you can",
            "You did what was best for her. You saved her from the pain. Going through this is very difficult, saying goodbye so suddenly. She was in pain and I don\u2019t think cats can cry like humans do, I don\u2019t think they cry when feeling sad. It was probably her body malfunctioning.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure she loved you and she knows you did it to help her. No one wants to suffer.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you had to experience this, may she rest in peace and you take care \ud83e\udec2",
            "She got to see the eyes of her loving, loyal servant looking into hers.  Up to the very end, you were there for her.",
            "You did the right thing OP. You loved her and she loved you. She is waiting by the rainbow bridge, and my cat Sheriff will keep her company until you arrive ok?",
            "I'm so sorry to hear about your cat.  It sounds like you went through a really tough ordeal, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling horrible.  The image of your cat crying is heartbreaking, but it's important to remember that doesn't necessarily mean she was in pain.  Cats can tear up when they're stressed or scared, and that vet visit must have been overwhelming for her.",
            "Awh what you did was the ultimate act of pure love. You didn\u2019t allow her to suffer needlessly and this is the meaning of true love. Cats are not capable of crying. Her little body was shutting down and you ensured she was loved and comfortable in her final moments. She crossed over the rainbow bridge and she will definitely be waiting for you on the other side. Hugs",
            "You were present. She was not alone.",
            "Thank you, that does help a little bit."

            "I'm sorry for your loss.  I myself lost my furbaby last month and recently went to the shelter and adopted 2 kittens (8 weeks).  I was devastated when I lost my last cat, and said I would never get another cat again.  That feeling only lasted a short time because I missed having a little buddy around.\n\nHere's how I see it.  I didn't replace him.  The kittens aren't him.  But I had a house full of cat furniture/toys ... I have food in the cupboard and LOVE in my heart for cats.  I am honoring him by helping his little furry bretheren, giving them a safe life full of love.  Why would my little soul fur-baby be mad at me for that?  Would he want me to be lonely and sad?\n\nThere are shelters all over the world that are bursting at the seams with cats that need homes.  You gave your previous pets a great home ... do the same for others.  Don't let the love die with them.",
            "Not a replacement. Just paying the love forward. Let yourself love.",
            "No kitty ever replaces a kitty. But I like to allocate my kitties so that they overlap so that I'm not getting into lonely cat phases, and I don't think that's bad of me or anything. So in turn, I think you are absolutely fine! Consider your new baby and snuggle them times 100.",
            "Your cats led you to the new baby. They want you to find peace with another cat cuz they know you\u2019re hurting. Sometimes you have to trust that the universe is guiding you to what you need, even if you don\u2019t feel ready for it.",
            "Maybe I\u2019m just weird, but every time I\u2019ve lost a pet I\u2019ve gotten a new one within a week. Feel sad when it\u2019s their time to go, but plenty of pets out there that need homes. I don\u2019t always do rescues/ shelters either, far as I\u2019m concerned there\u2019s a good chance people giving away/ selling pets locally (that aren\u2019t breeders, I don\u2019t buy from them directly) will eventually have their pets ending up in a shelter/ on the street anyway. It\u2019s all the same to me, get them all fixed after I move them in. Shelter in my town has become too rigorous (both adopting and surrendering) to be worth the time which I think is causing the increase in strays I\u2019ve been seeing.",
            "I\u2019ve found that the best solution for grief from a cat\u2019s passing is to get another one. You\u2019re not dishonoring your previous cats. You can\u2019t ever fully replace them because every cat is an individual. Good luck.",
            "Please don\u2019t feel guilty.  You gave your babies a good, long life and can do that for more kitties.  I lost my 21, 20 and 17 year old cats and said the same thing. No more; it\u2019s too hard to lose them. Well, 3 kitty sisters were born in my backyard and I fell in love.  13 years later with no regrets.",
            "Someone once told me that when you lose a cat the silver lining is that it makes space in your life to give another cat a loving home. Your babies aren't feeling sad that you've replaced them, they're probably proud that another new little guy gets to enjoy your love",
            "Grief is a long and different process for each person, the situation you are in is quite painful and it is okay to feel everything you feel. Perhaps you feel that making room for a new kitten is taking away the place of the previous ones and in no case is that possible. You don't need to preserve your sadness to honor them, because they would be happy to see you smile again, that's for sure. Maybe it helps to make something that makes sense to you, like an altar or a small corner un your house where you can remember your beloved kittens, and thus deal with that feeling of guilt a little.

You know yourself they all have there own we personalities and your relationship with each is unique, so they really cannot be replaced.",
            "I started resenting my surviving cats when my dearest cat died. It took time for me to move through the emotions. I\u2019m writing this on the 1 year anniversary of his passing while my other two are cozied up in my lap and thinking I never thought I\u2019d move past the pain. The first 3 months I swear my heart was ripping apart but slowly through grieving and mourning I\u2019ve made it here. I believe in the cat distribution system and they find you at the right time. Maybe this kitten will help you and Chai heal. Whenever you feel guilty actually pause and look at it. In such cases I believe it\u2019s nothing more than misplaced pain or rather overflowing pain that starts to touch the core of everything we think and feel. And don\u2019t forget we are stewards of these magical beings, you wouldn\u2019t feel guilty for taking care of an animal in need right? That\u2019s part of taking in a pet. So while the pain distorts your thoughts just think you\u2019re taking in this kitten to help it and slowly your mind will settle again.",
            "I'm having this same issue at the moment - my cat, who was just absolutely my soulmate, died on 3 June (six months to the day after my mother). I miss him desperately, but I also miss having a cat, but if I got another cat would it mean I didn't love him? Would it be a betrayal?\n\nMy friend, who's been in the same position, passed on a saying from her friend: 'When cats die they always send a new cat to join their old home if they were happy there. It's the old cat looking out for you.'\n\nHowever literally you take it, I think that's a good way of looking at it. There are so many cats out there that need us, and love isn't a finite resource; we can love and care for a new cat and still remember and love those that have passed.",
            "I lost my soulmate cat in 2021, and then lost my grumpy old lady in December 2023. For the month of January I didn\u2019t have a cat. I almost didn\u2019t make it. I finally stumbled across this little guy up for adoption and I just didn\u2019t think about it, went to meet him, immediately adopted him and then almost threw up when I got home from feeling guilty. But then I\u2019ve been trying to remind myself that my cats didn\u2019t like it when I was sad, and my grief from losing them will never shrink, but the love I have for another baby will grow around it and make it seem a little easier. I\u2019ve always had really chatty cats, and new guy is just the same. So I talk to him about them. I honestly, to my core, feel like they sent him. Basically all I\u2019m saying is I get it and I\u2019m so sorry, but your heart has room for more love and you and your current baby deserve to have someone come in and help you heal \ud83d\udda4",
            "I think that\u2019s one of those things where you\u2019re always going to feel a little guilt. I remember when I was a kid and my cat died, 5 months later my mum surprised me with a kitten. I was so excited but that night I went to bed and cried, I felt like I was abandoning her. \n\nBut the new cat became my absolute world, she\u2019s 15 today and she\u2019s the sweetest lady ever. I just liken it to relationships, after a long term relationship you\u2019re always going to feel a bit weird the first time you move on, but you can\u2019t just give up.\n\nRemember you gave your cats everything they could want, they lived long happy lives, and now you have the resources and capacity to do the same for another one who is in need of a home. You\u2019ll be so glad you did, but don\u2019t feel bad for feeling bad, let the feelings happen, it\u2019s just lingering love for your old kitties.",
            "Grief hits everyone differently, and you have had a very rough year losing the ones you love in an awful short time. It's okay to grieve. It's okay to cry. It's okay not to be absolutely in love with your new family addition, as your heart is still healing.\n\n\nAs long as you can take care of your cat and kitten, the hurt will lessen with time, and your heart will allow new feelings of love in. You're not replacing your lost cats. You're opening your home and eventually, your heart, for another.",
            "What's to feel guilty about?  Think how the cat or kitten would feel to get adopted into a loving home.  Shelters are bursting with cats and kittens who need homes. They may die if not adopted.  You have a home to offer. Your deceased cats, guaranteed, would not want you to suffer and grieve.  Get the kitten or cat that connects with you. Life goes on.",
            "Getting another cat isn't replacing the one that you have lost..\n\nIf you have the resources and the love in your heart by all means offer your home to a new kitty. You would be doing the cat World a disservice if you did not.",
            "Oh love, I'm so sorry for your losses. I think everyone is different, some people need to find a new companion right away to deal with the pain. It took me almost two full years after I had to euthanize my Mia to feel ready to welcome a new cat in my life. If I think about her too long I still tear up now. \n\nI adopted Aske a little over a month ago and there are moments that I get a surprise guilt pang. When I tell him I love him, or when one of his behaviours reminds me of Mia. Sometimes I compare him to her and then I feel even more guilty because it's not fair to him.\n\nBut... Getting to know Aske has been really great. It hasn't changed how much I still love my Mia, and how much I still miss her. But he has brought a breath of fresh air to my home that I hadn't realized I needed. I don't feel like I've replaced her with Aske, I'm simply moving on with my life and giving love and care to someone that needs it right now. Sometimes I wonder what they'd think of each other \ud83e\udd72\n\nYou should get a kitten when and if you feel ready for it. It has nothing to do with replacing your babies because that's simply not possible. Nothing can really replace them, right? They're irreplaceable, and will always hold a very special place in your heart. Love is not finite, lucky for us we have an infinite supply of it in our hearts \u2665\ufe0f \n\nI wish you healing and health, and may you find the best solution for you and your current cat.",

            "Last July, I lost my beloved soul cat, Sally, after a 2 year long battle with advanced kidney disease. Devastated doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it. Her brother, Pudd (also my soul cat, even more so for my husband) was now living alone for the first time. 6 months after we passed, we decided to adopt a little girl kitten for company for him, but also for us. I was so nervous that I would \u201ccompare\u201d the two. But I promise you, I didn\u2019t. We spent a few months looking and met 4-5 kittens until we found \u201cthe one\u201d that would be a good personality for Pudd. Shes amazing. We love her so much. It\u2019s so strange, I feel like the love is just as strong, but it\u2019s completely different. I still think of Sally every day. Sometimes Honey reminds me of Sally. But we have our own routines and silly little bonding things.\n\nOne month after we brought Honey home, we unexpectedly lost Pudd to quick growing lymphoma. It was so painful. So now Honey was all alone. \nHaving a kitten alone is very sad. So, we adopted Fish (long story short, he\u2019s her brother, but he wasn\u2019t caught until a few months after she was, with their mom, so the rescue reached out to us and said they\u2019d give him to us if we wanted)\n\nBottom line is that we are never REPLACING. We are merely expanding our hearts to love another. The most beautiful thing we can do, is love another and give another kitty a good home, in honour of the kitties we\u2019ve lost.\n\nYour happiness matters, and a new friend will help you out in more ways than you realize.",

            "I actually think this happens. I deeply loved my first cat, and I was devastated when he died from a stroke at age 16. I went to the shelter that day, just to look, because I didn't know what to do with my time now, and I connected with a gray Oriental type kitten who abruptly stood up and talked to me as if he'd been waiting for me.  I adopted him. We had 22 amazing years together.  I swear he was *sent* my way by my first cat, to heal my broken heart. While at the shelter, I was standing looking at the gray cat and wondering if I should adopt his cagemate when I felt a tap on my shoulder. Turned to see a very shy orange kitten making biscuits with a look in his eyes that clearly said \"Pick me. Please pick me!\"  So, I adopted him, too.  We had 17 fantastic years together.  Those two cats and I *loved* each other.  My advice to anyone deeply grieving a deceased cat, is: Switch it off.  Look for the opportunities for happiness. Think like a cat.  Live in the moment.",
            "I knew my baby boy was the one cuz he was brought in with his two other brothers and our last two cats were also from litters of three. One of his brothers also had the same name as one of our rescue dogs, so it felt like the universe was screaming at me to get this kitten I had my eye on, even if I told myself I would wait a little bit after I moved out on my own before I got a cat. But the universe knows what you need sometimes!"

The last one lived to be 17, and was with me from the time he was 10 weeks.\n\nThe newest kitten came to me at 5 weeks.  I did my research and he ate kitten food for about a month, but it made him really gassy, and I suspect he was uncomfortable because of it.  He inevitably figured out the adults were getting different food, and once he got a taste of it, he wouldn't touch the kitten food anymore.  We gave in and let him just have the adult food, and he's been eating it ever since.  His gas cleared up, and he's strong and healthy, and almost a year now.\n\nSo, I'm on the fence whether or not kitten food is \"required\".  It's probably not really, but it's not any more expensive than the adult variety, so it's a good route to take just in case.\n\nI still vehemently push an all wet food diet on people, but even that's a struggle in reality.  I have 3 very regimented cats right now.  1 prefers dry (but he'll eat cheap wet food, I think he's just a carb junkie), 1 prefers wet (the kitten), and only 1 eats what I consider a healthy combination of both wet and dry.\n\nYour kitten will most likely be fine.  \n\nI recommend just watching for any changes in bathroom habits, as they're usually the first indication of a problem, and if your cats must eat dry food, look for something grain free.",

I also talked to a friend who owns two cats that she adopted years after each other, and she provided some really good insight too. I\u2019m absolutely going to do my best to keep her, because tbh I\u2019ve never loved anything enough to wake up in the morning and wipe their butthole before haha! My main focus will be getting the kitten and dog used to each other asap, and I\u2019ll be letting her sleep in my room! Thank you guys sm!!**\n\nMonday I adopted a 10wk/2.5 month old kitten. I love her. She\u2019s incredibly sweet and absolutely adorable. Im back home from college so ima how to spend most of my day with her, from around 10 am to 10 pm she\u2019s with me nonstop unless my mom or my brother feel like playing with her. At ten, I put her in her safe zone in the bathroom with a litter box, toys, food and water for the night. When I wake up in the morning the first thing I do is check up on her and wipe her butt bc she was taken from her mom a little too early and struggles with having a few crumbs there. \n\nThere\u2019s just 2 problems. \n\n1. My family has a dog. We\u2019ve had her for 5 years now, going on 6. The dog is super curious about the cat, and constantly wants to go where the cat is and begs to see her. However, the Kitten absolutely hates her. I never have them running around at the same time because I\u2019ve read up on her about introductions and it being a gradual process. But, now I either have to deal with the cat meowing because it\u2019s wants to run around or the dog whining because she doesn\u2019t get as much free reign of the house as she used to. \n\n2. I keep having this looming feeling that I made a mistake by adopting her. At night when I put her away im immediately combated by thoughts that I\u2019ve made a mistake, that I can\u2019t care for her, and that she should not be here. I only have these thoughts when im not with her. Im a person who really struggles with depression and mental illness, and before I got her I spent most of my summer sleeping and unable to leave my bed. My family and I don\u2019t always get along, so I never really interacted with them either. I spent all my time alone and/or playing the sims in bed. Now, I have an obligation to fulfill and barely spend any time alone.\n\nMy parents are giving me  2 week period/ trial run to adjust. \n\nWhat should I do?? Should I give her back? Getting another kitten is not an option for me at the moment. Support, advice, or anything of the sort would be highly appreciated. \n\n\n\n",

I would concentrate on getting  the dog and cat used to each other... they could become buddies, and that will expand the kitten's world. You sound like you are feeling pressure... having a new pet does come with some stress, but it should lessen as the kitten grows, especially if the dog and kitten become buds. Try to relax a bit. Of course, if you continue to feel overwhelmed, think about returning or rehoming the kitty. Maybe just give it a few more weeks or a couple of months and see how you feel then.",

Lots to get used to, lots of extra stress\n\n\n2 - it's a kitten, has high needs, and without other kittens to play with will become bored quickly (even destructive). This puts a lot more burden on you compared to 2 kittens or an adult cat\n\n\nGive yourself a few weeks to get out of the transition and see how you feel.\u00a0\n\n\nI was debiltatingly depressed and anxious when I got my first cat. He helped me a ton. I wish the same for you. (That said tho, I got an adult cat who was very easy, and came from a house with dogs so he got along with everyone from day 1 pretty much)",

As long as your kitten has appropriate food, somewhere safe to sleep, interaction and love, she will be fine.\n\nI have a single kitten who is nearly 10 weeks old now and I live alone and work. It's tricky but she was on her own and it's better for her to be with me than where she was. I don't like leaving her when I am at work but she mostly sleeps (I have a camera on her) and when I am not at work, I give her lots of attention. I play with her and she can sleep in my bedroom if she wants to (she sleeps under the bed). I do worry about single kitten syndrome etc but I am doing my best and I am not going to stress myself out because a relaxed owner is better for pets. \n\nYour kitten will be ok, if possible let her sleep in your room and introduce her slowly to your dog.

Also with the fact it\u2019s a kitty you pretty much have a newborn where the whole world is new and exciting, which can mean more stress on you for monitoring them.

You've obviously got a good heart.\n\nI would ask yourself if you will be able to provide for her as she gets older, in terms of the cost of food and healthcare, and whether you will be able to provide a good environment for her if you move from your parents' house. Cats need stimulation, exercise and in my opinion they benefit hugely from having access to the outdoors, so long as it's reasonably safe. Did you get her from an animal shelter? What would happen if you returned her? If you truly want to care for her I'm sure you'll find a way of doing so, and with regard to the dog, she'll probably have it trained in no time :-)\n\nWhen I was at uni in my early 20s I rescued two kittens that had been abandoned in our back yard. They stayed in my room for several weeks whilst I juggled going to lectures with looking after them. After I left uni one of them (we sadly lost his brother) lived with me very happily for another 18 years.",
            "I also recently adopted a new kitten ! He\u2019s very vocal and 3 months old. I will say it\u2019s a transition period FOR SURE. Kittens require more needs but playing with them as much as you can and they will nap , I take that time to do my things and clean and sometimes I get some other automatic toys going so he can play with them by him self . I always always keep my eyes on him even from afar . I currently am being treated for anxiety/panic disorder and have been away from work for the past month so this is a lot for me as well and I know this kitten phase will be gone in a blink of an eye.",
            "Can you put the kitten in a carrier and put her near the dog? Once she realises that the dogs not a threat she should feel calmer around him however it's safer for both kitten and dog. I did that when I got my kitten with my cay and within days they were fine with each other I couldn't cope with thw crying from either of my cats and I panicked as well but 4 weeks on they follow each other absolutely everywhere can't be without one another",
            "Give it some time. My cat lost his shit and tried to run off the first time he met my dog but now they\u2019re best mates. The kitten will get used to your dog but you have to give her more than 5 days to adjust. Make sure to give your dog attention too so she doesn\u2019t feel left out and whinge.\n\nKittens are a lot of work and can be exhausting but they\u2019re so worth it. You might be feeling like you can\u2019t care for her and that all your time is spent looking after her. That\u2019s just because you\u2019re adjusting to having her there. You\u2019ll adapt in time as the kitten grows up and learns her routines/learns how you like things to be. Then you\u2019ll wonder how you ever lived without her.",
            "It does seem that you didn't think it through, responsibly before getting the cat. \n\n1. Kittens should not be separated from their mums before 12 weeks. They might develop issues like the uncleanliness you described or they might not be socialised enough and show destructive behaviour or violent play that will bother most owners and is unfair to the cat.\n\n2. Kittens should never be adopted without a buddy of the same age. For the same reasons of socialisation, not being destructive and violent but also not being bored and depressed. Keeping two kittens is actually easier than keeping one because they can stay alone for a few hours with each other's company without you having to stress about them being depressed.\n\n3. While it can work out with dogs in the house, it's usually not recommended to bring a kitten into a dog household as they're rough players, loud and will stress or could even harm the cat. \n\nI would make my decision depending on how long the kitten has been separated from its mother:\n\nHas it only been a few days? I would try to take it back to its mum and see if the mum still accepts it, so it can have more baby time and learn kitten things. I don't think the mum would take it back after two weeks. \n\nYou said you can't get a second kitten but this would be a good second option. \nI lived in my parent's house when I got my first kitten (it was a stray that had lost its mother) and we were struggling with all the mentioned social issues. My parents were absolutely against a second cat but I still did what was best for the kitten and got him a buddy. All issues disappeared immediately. \n\nI think that you're asking those questions shows that you are learning responsibility even though the process of getting the cat was a bit ill-informed. A responsible cat owner can give them a good life. If you have depressed phases in bed, the cat(s!) will snuggle up with you. \nBut you do need to change the current situation in order to provide a good life.  \nIt sounds a bit cruel to me to have a baby taken from its mum too early and then lock it into the cold dark bathroom all by itself, when it still needs to care and warmth, I would let her sleep in my room. \n\nWhat will happen to her if the mother won't take her back?  What will happen to her psyche if she keeps living in this exact condition? I think you will find a good solution. Just don't wait too long, until her character is out of place due to the above reasons and then decide to give her away. Do what is fair :)",
            "Also, my kitty was taken from his mom too early and couldn\u2019t clean himself or use the litter box properly. I got a second one, introduced them slowly, and now they\u2019re friends. The interesting thing is my Siamese taught my other baby how to clean himself and use the box among other things. It isn\u2019t much work to have another cat as others have said, and it improved his life so much to have someone else to chill with if he\u2019s lonely, let alone teach him all the ropes",
            "At one point I had 2 cats and 2 dogs, one cat ended up being more friendly with our dogs and the other cat just drove everyone nuts. The cat was a 5lb Siamese and she bossed around a husky, German Shepard and main coon cat\u2026introductions do wonders",
            "Aww what a sweet pie . I used to feel the same about my cat . But o love her to much . To give her back . She gives me a lot of cuddles. You don\u2019t have to let her be with you all of the time . But she think you\u2019re her mother or dad . She is going to want to be with you . I let my baby cat sleep with me.",
            "Let the cat meow and whine for a while she\u2019ll be fine till they can adjust",
            "yea but also be careful with the dogs you can't be too trusting esp now bc it's a kitten",
            "Not to mention the kitten being in solitary confinement all night they need company.\n\n I had 2 dogs and 8 cats plus 2 more that lived outside couldn't be tamed to be brought in they managed to get along I think the introductory period isn't working whatever you're doing isn't working so you have to look for another way to do it the dog can be leashed you can put a collar breakaway collar with a bell on the kitten.  The only time I've ever had cats or kittens locked in my bathroom was doing some sort of quarantine or when I first got them because they were trapped on the street and so it was for the safety of everyone in the house but once that part was over the introductions have to begin somehow",
            "Yeah I have an anxiety disorder and was never the most comfortable around pets. In two weeks, I became used to the kitten. (The kitten wasn\u2019t mine, but lived with us) and now we\u2019re inseparable. I love him so much! \ud83d\udc95",
            "Oh thank god it\u2019s a good sign. My dog is typically uninterested in other people and dogs, but has never been around a kitten or cat before. She has been around a smaller dog through, as my childhood dog was with me since for 12 years until she pased. My childhood dog hated her until the end, but my larger dog strolled adored her lol. Thank you sm :)!",
            "If i move from my parents house, i have two options. My mom is willing to keep her there because she\u2019s also fallen in love with her, or I can take her with me on campus as an emotional support animal! I don\u2019t go back to school until mid August, I have a job at Twin Peaks there so im not really worried about not being able to afford her, haha. Thank you dm for the advice :)!",
            "I know that they shouldn\u2019t be separated from their mother until 12 weeks, but her mother had already been adopted from the shelter :(. The shelter advertised them together, but I guess because her mom was a purebred Siamese and the kitten was a mix, someone decided they only wanted a cheaper purebred cat.  If I could\u2019ve let her be with her longer, I absolutely would have! \n\nAnd I\u2019ve been talking to a friend who owns 2 cats, and starting tomorrow night, and she suggested letting her sleep in my room while also having free rein of the house so she doesn\u2019t get bored while I\u2019m sleeping. The dog sleeps through the night like a log in a kennel, so that\u2019ll keep them from interacting where she could get to her. So that\u2019s what I think im gonna do moving forward! \n\nThank you for the advice though, I really do appreciate it! I love this kitten sm, and after thinking through I\u2019m gonna do whatever I can to help her develop the best way I can :).",
            "She\u2019s only ever alone after 10 pm. So far she\u2019s really good at sleeping through the night until she hears someone walk past. If she hears someone she starts meowing really loudly. I\u2019ve gotten her on a schedule where at 9 we start playing to tire her out, then I put her up to eats at 9:45, I play with her again until a little after 10 when she gets exhausted and then leave her alone for the night so I can sleep. During the day I sleep on her time, whenever she naps I nap, but she only sleeps for like 1 1/2 hrs at a time. \n\nAnd my biggest focus going forward will be getting her used to the dog. I\u2019ve been scent swapping a blanket between them, and allowing them to sniff each other whenever my dog is in her kennel. I would bring her in my room at night too, but im afraid she won\u2019t let me sleep :(",
            "I think that sounds like a great plan for now! I'm surprised the shelter did that,  that's kinda illegal in shelters around Europe to separate them manually that early!\n\nIf mum is no option, don't bring her anywhere where she might end up with less reflected humans than you, I'm sure you will try your best!\n\nDon't cross out that thought of a second kitty though altogether. \n\nCats can become very naughty if bored or restricted too much, so giving her more space sounds like a great idea.\nIf you don't want her on the kitchen counters for example, give her a great alternative in the kitchen that she's allowed on, like the windowsill. That way she can learn rules but also live out her curiosity and have an overview of the place. Same with bed and basket etc. But who can resist snuggling up with kitty at night anyway?! :)",
            "I've been rescuing cats/kittens for around 20 years and have had to do more introductions than I can count. One thing that has worked reliably is to feed each animal with the door between them (the dog on one side of the door and the kitten on the other side of the door). The door is there for safety but also to block the visual of one another.  When they are in that close proximity of one another, and each are fed treats or food they begin to associate the smell of the other with good things like treats and food which makes the scent of one another related in their brain as a good thing. I've done this I know at least a hundred times and it works great it takes a little time but it works great. Also the scent swapping that you're doing with the blanket excellent idea",
            "Oh man - reading things like this makes me feel so lucky. Our little void sleeps through the night, and always has. \n\nShe\u2019s about 5-6lbs and we have a 90lb dog. Since the cat was super brave and the dog is always gentle, they got used to each other so fast. They sleep together, the kitty likes to be bathed by the dog and the dog loves giving her kisses.",
            "It sounds like you are doing a great job and taking your commitment to both of your pets very seriously. I agree with the other comments re: this part not being a very accurate assessment of what cat ownership will be like *long term*. My cat is about 6 now and I wish he would be needier, LOL, because he is very independent, as many cats are. Change is always uncomfortable, but you guys will likely all adjust and be able to share a happy life with lots of love. Dogs are social creatures, and Dog will probably enjoy having another furry four legged member in their crew once they get used to each other. \n\nI think the advice about feeding them on opposite sides of a closed door is great advice as well. And you are doing the right thing by asking for advice and feedback because you encountered a situation where you don't quite know what to do. I think you likely have what it takes to be a great Cat Parent. If you start to introduce them and it seems like you aren't making ANY progress and it's turning into a potentially dangerous situation for one of them or one of them starts showing signs of fear and anxiety that doesn't abate, OK, you may need to reassess the idea, but I think you are on the right track. Don't be afraid to reach out to your vet for advice, as well. Your local shelters would probably have some good suggestions, too, if you start to feel stuck.\n\nGood luck to you and your family. Hoping for the best for all of you. Be blessed.",
            "There\u2019s no laws against it in America as far as I know, or at least not in my state :(.\n\nThankfully she\u2019s incredibly confident about exploring the house. On day two she escaped through a crack in my door when I went to answer it and immediately started exploring. I love snuggling up with her! We nap together during the day, I think the only problem might be to teach her Im allowed to sleep without her.",
            "Why would you want to \ud83d\ude05 jk\n\nI have two cats, one sleeps on my feet (to my dismay) every night and one sleeps somewhere on the bed occasionally. But I move the one from my feet (or he gets accidentally pushed in the night) and he still loves me and comes back every day. My point being they can learn that you need space too, without being offended or stop wanting to sleep with you. Just careful you don\u2019t squish her lol.",
            "I just mentioned that, not because you have to stock to laws (animal protection laws are pretty horribly miserable everywhere), it's just an info to wrap one's mindset around. If some counties are starting to realise there's an issue to an extent where they make rules to prevent it, one should ask if the issue shouldnt be taken more seriously in my soundings. \n\nBut in the end you already adopted a kitty from the shelter and that's already a great thing! Also there's nothing better than never having to sleep without it, haha!"

        "content": "My dad and I had to euthanize our 16 year old cat yesterday. She had pleural effusion and we were only given three options: drain the fluid then and have her get some relief but then she could have died at any point, admit her to a pet hospital where they still would have had to figure out the issue, or euthanize her. The vet said that it could have been congestive heart failure or cancer. But she said that the prognosis for surgery at this point would be poor because of her age and the fluid could return. My dad wanted to admit her to a hospital and my mom said euthanize. The vet said the most humane thing would be to euthanize her. But ultimately they left the decision up to me. \n\n\nIt killed me inside but I didn't want her to suffer. I loved her so much and to watch her go through pain and not be able to eat, drink, or go to the bathroom hurt me so much. Did I want to do the surgery? Absolutely. But I feel like she would have been suffering more if I had just let her go. And I didn't want her to have to go through a life on medication or dealing with the fluid coming back. So I signed the paper to have her euthanized. \n\n\nNow I'm dealing with a bunch of guilt and regret. I don't know if I should have figured out another solution. If I should have gotten another opinion. My friend said I should have taken her to the vet monthly and they probably would have caught it earlier and saved her and that made me cry harder. I feel like a terrible pet owner and I feel like I gave them permission to kill my cat. I miss her so much. It feels like I lost a sister. ",

            "Firstly your friend is wrong, no one routinely takes their cat to the vet monthly, so it won't have been caught earlier.\n\nSecondly as has been said cat's don't look forward to tomorrow, they don't think that way but they do know pain. So it's better to ethanise a day, a week, a month too early than a day too late.",
            "Hi, I had the almost exact same decision to make last year with my 16 year old cat.\u00a0\n\nWe went with draining (to take her home so my daughter could say goodbye), and then euthanizing a few days later.\n\nThose few days were progressively harder for my little cat. He was in pain by the third day, and I wished we had euthanized sooner.\n\nAs a cancer survivor, I have had pleural effusions myself, and it feels like not being able to catch a breath. I knew what my cat was feeling.\n\nYour cat was suffering, and you did the right thing!!!\u00a0",
            "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through so much, but you helped end your cats suffering in the most humane way without letting her suffer as you waited to make a choice. \n\nCats do not fear death, they fear pain and discomfort. They do not know today or tomorrow, they don\u2019t look forward to another day like we do. All they know is what\u2019s here and now. If her quality of life was diminished greatly then you gave her a great kindness by ending her pain.",
            "I went through this earlier this year. My girl was struggling to breathe in late January, the vet said her lungs were full of fluid and said I could not take her home, that we had to intervene. The vet suggested euthanasia right away but since I'd come in there suspecting something like asthma, I was not prepared for news like that. My cat was only 11. I opted for further diagnosis and she was determined to have heart failure. She stayed overnight and I took her home with medication the following day. To make a long story shorter, she was on twice daily meds, weekly vet visits and it was a daily rollercoaster for me and her. Some days were good and others I was an anxious wreck, constantly worrying about whether she could breathe. After 2 months she stopped eating all together and I had to let her go. So to your experience, the right answer isn't always doing more. It could've been equally as hard to watch daily struggle like I did and to the person who suggested it could've been caught earlier, I asked my vet the same question and beat myself up over how I didn't know. The vet simply stated that even vets aren't catching heart disease and cats are very good at hiding their pain. Allow yourself to grieve and miss your kitty. I'm sure you did the best you could.",
            "It\u2019s one of the hardest decisions I ever have to make and I\u2019ve done it multiple times.  I\u2019m a 52 year old guy and had to make the call ago for my beloved 19 year old Willow and I broke down for weeks.  It\u2019s always hard, I wish I could that the decisions get easier but they don\u2019t.  But I wouldn\u2019t trade those years with my pets for anything",
            "You made the hardest decision out of love, not guilt. You did what's best.",
            "You call this person a friend but they are not being one right now. You did your cat a kindness. There\u2019s nothing that guarantees they would have caught it earlier - they would have probably told you to stop bringing her in so often.",
            "I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through this. Making that decision is so hard. I made a very similar decision back in December. My sweet baby girl was likely dying of heart and kidney failure and had fluid built up on her lungs. My vet said the most humane option was to let her go, that she was so old already it would just torture for her. And I agreed. We cried as she did it and she told me she would have chosen the same route for her animals. It\u2019s never going to be easy, but you took her pain away and are carrying it yourself now. Which is a selfless thing to do. She\u2019s bouncing around across the rainbow bridge waiting for you, free and happy and not in pain. I hope you find some peace soon, much love to you \ud83d\udda4",
            "I just had to make this decision Monday for my 8 year old cat. It boiled down to 2 of the three options were for my benefit alone, only 1 was for his benefit and that was euthanasia. And I just keep telling myself that. It was one battle he wasn't coming back from, and that's OK. The guilt will linger, especially when surgery is offered, but you have to decide what's more important quality or quantity?",
            "Such a beautiful little baby. God bless you for the years of love you had",
            "We don't even see our own healthcare staff monthly. Weird statement from a \"friend\" who's supposed to be consoling and reassuring you that u did the right in which in FACT YOU  DID and I think you know you did youre just hurting and feel a little guilty because someone had to physically do the deed rather than naturally and then on top of that they had to have your permission to do so. Those are normal feelings. My mother had pancreatic cancer. My mother didn't want to be resuscitated if it ever came to that point and unfortunately it did. my sister and I had to make the decision to allow the doctors to pull her life support after she became non responsible and unable to breathe on her own. I know what we did was the right thing to do but in the end I was always left feeling like maybe she would have woke back up but that's normal to feel that way and there's no way we would ever know that for sure. but what we do know is that in that moment we made the decision that we felt was best and i wouldn't change a thing my mother left this world peacefully and surrounded by her family members and love instead of at home sick and suffering. You did the right thing you just gotta process that guilt. And just know that feeling of guilt just shows even more how much you loved your fur baby. You'd only do what's best",
            "\"So it's better to euthanise a day, a week, a month too early than a day too late.\"  \nWord cannot express how much I needed to hear this - six years later and I STILL agonize over losing our precious boy before the suffering got worse, but this helped me SO immensely, thank you.",
            "My little one had bloodwork done 6 weeks before I had to make the decision. She saw the vet less than 2 weeks before I noticed her having a hard time breathing, and I took her back and got the news (she was getting regular arthritis shots). Yes, I'm only going to that vet now for basic stuff and making the drive for the big stuff. My kitty was keeping secrets, I didn't notice till it was way too late to treat it, and the vet feeling her during the visits didn't notice either. I've given myself permission to not feel guilty, but the what ifs are still there.",
            "Thursday for me, also 8 years old. He had a brain tumour and we did surgery, hoping it was a begign meningioma. Turned out to be an incredibly rare form of an incredibly rare cancer, so much so that they had no prognosis because there\u2019s no protocol. We tried several different things but he started seizing on wednesday night and when the vet told us how much it took to stop the seizure we made the call to let him go and said goodbye on Thursday. \n\nI couldn\u2019t keep him alive for me, cause that wasn\u2019t living it was existing. My happy boy was gone, the tumour took him. Postmortem MRI showed it had grown significantly in the 5 weeks since the surgery.",
            "I'm glad it helps and I'm so sorry you have been struggling with your decesion.  Just know in your heart you did the hard thing but the right thing by helping your boy to suffer.  That is so much better than giving him a short extra period of life only to suffer at the end.",
            "I get you, i had to euthanise my loving furball a year ago almost to the day. For a whole year im torturing myself if i could have done something differently for a better outcome. Its really hard letting it go.",
