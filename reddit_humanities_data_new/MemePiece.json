Most of us have this idea that 18 yo are adults, but we only think that because it was stabilished as such. The human brain development goes through the mid 20s etc, so something like 25 would be justifiable. Not 18 yo, nor 16 yo.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is that 18yo is not different from 16 yo. I guess there must be some brain development etc, but definitely not something that would justify a person being aware of their relationships or not. There's nothing special during the 16-18 period, so it's understandable for other countries to have 16 yo as age of consent, for example.\n\nEdit: I missed that you mentioned the power imbalance, sorry... if the main issue you see is the age gap, I agree 100%. 16yo with a 19yo, in comparison to 18yo with a 21yo, makes more sense.",
