I will not fight but discuss and the baseline of calling me anti-semitic for being against an ethnical cleansing and an apartheid state is not a baseline I can accept for discussion.\n\n**I condemn Hamas** but I condemn Israel even more for how they reacted to it and what they did since 1948. Regarding 7.10 how can you (being a democratict state recognized by the west) argue to kill 100 children for 1 child killed by a terrorstic organisation? How can you argue to let people starve? To not provide people medicine? To not provide people shelter? To destroy civil infrastructure? To use human shields (yes there are reports even confirmed by the IDF see below) and there is so much more.\n\n\n\n  \nHuman shield part I mentioned:  \nThe Israeli Defence Ministry will appeal against a supreme court ruling banning the use of Palestinian human shields in raids, officials said.The Israeli supreme court ruled last Thursday that the 'human shield' procedure used by the IDF when detaining Palestinian terror suspects is illegal and violates international law.Israeli Defense Forces made use of 'human shield' procedures on 1,200 occasions over the last five years, officials said.",

Some of them were reportedly holding white pieces of cloth when they were killed by the Israeli army or affiliated forces,\u201d the experts said.\n\nThe experts expressed serious concern about the arbitrary detention of hundreds of Palestinian women and girls, including human rights defenders, journalists and humanitarian workers, in Gaza and the West Bank since 7 October. Many have reportedly been subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment, denied menstruation pads, food and medicine, and severely beaten. On at least one occasion, Palestinian women detained in Gaza were allegedly kept in a cage in the rain and cold, without food.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly distressed by reports that Palestinian women and girls in detention have also been subjected to multiple forms of sexual assault, such as being stripped naked and searched by male Israeli army officers. At least two female Palestinian detainees were reportedly raped while others were reportedly threatened with rape and sexual violence,\u201d the experts said. They also noted that photos of female detainees in degrading circumstances were also reportedly taken by the Israeli army and uploaded online.\n\n  \nSo yes - Israel is telling us lies without any evidences and after things are checked there is no evidence.

            "In May, the UN admitted that the death toll was not accurate as it relies on Gaza's health ministry, which is controlled by Hamas. There are various issues with this, the major ones being that they count Hamas combatants as \"civillians\" and the fact that having an accurate number takes time - it took Israel over a month to have an accurate death toll number for the October 7th massacre. Also, a 16 year old kid with an AK is jot a kid if you ask me, no matter the nationality, religion, or anything else.\n\nHere's one of many reports on it: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/05/17/un-death-toll-change-gaza-fact-check/73737102007/\n\n\nThis alone proves that the UN's current way of working is lacking integrity. If the case was the other way around, you'd agree with me, I assume so...\n\n\nIn 1948, the British (that controlled what's Israel today) declared there will be two states,  Israel and Palestine. Israel then got attacked without provocation by Arabs from what was supposed to be Palestine and from Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, and more. So in 1948, after the Jews were almost exterminated by the Nazis, Arabs tried to finish the job in the Middle East. \n\n\nJust look at arab countries and tell me how many Jews live there nowadays.

Can you explain me how that logic works?",

But of course I use those reports if I find someone to discuss those past events and want to show valid sources.\n\nso both points form me stand:\n\n1) UN is too slow which makes many reports irrelevant\n\n2) I use the existing reports for past events.",

            "Britain controlled the land, like or not. This is a historical fact, not an opinion. The Jews went to Israel as they had no other place they would take them, even though the British did not always allow them to enter. We're talking about people being persecuted during an active genocide. \n\n\nI did not defend anything done by Israel, I just pointed out that Al Jazeera is biased and not reliable, and so os the UN as they rely on Hamas for data without doing anything to validate the data themselves. If tomorrow Russia says that Ukraine killed 10,000 kids by bombarding schools, will they just believe it or actually investigate it? \n\n\nLike I previously said, any crimes committed by an IDF soldier or unit should be investigated, and they should be prosecuted. This has happened countless times already, like in many other armies in civillized Western countries.\n\n\nIsrael has it's issues and like in any war, people will die. There's no other documented case where an army dropped panflets prior to an attack, telling people to evacuate. This has been done over the past decades by Israel, yet some will say the IDF is not moral.\n\n\nWhen other terrorist organizations operated from within a civilian population, people died. If you check the numbers, the Gaza death toll is not hugher than the average. I would've preferred that no one died on any side, of course. As opposed to most other cases where terrorist operated in civillian populations, in this case, they went into another country and massacred civillians, women, children, and babies.\n\n\nIf a terrorist organization crossed the border from, let's say, Mexico to the US and did this, no one would say anything when the US destroys Mexican cities. No one would mention the casualties as they look for kidnapped civillians (including women and children) knowingly the women are being raped systematically.\n\n\nImagine this happened in YOUR country. Imagine the grief and the rage. Imagine getting past that rage and just wanting your people back, while the terrorist decline any agreement offered to them.",

On the other hand many war crimes have been commited by Israel and those have been proven.\n\nDon't get me wrong I'm not taking sides with Hamas as these guys are terrorists that kill civilians I'm taking sides with the innocent victims of this war which are mostly victims of Israel's crimes."

It was not longer a, \"If you see somebody being racist, stop it or ignore them. But live normally otherwise.\" Versus the \"Remember there is racism and any time you see something in society, think of how race is involved.\" It was pushed as a regular thought. I believe it was well intentioned, but ultimately, it resulted in more racism by way of some pushing this idea too aggressively and some becoming so annoyed by it that they pushed back in a destructive manner.    \n    \nWhen I later moved to bigger cities, that was when this push to \"always think about racism\" was truly amplified. And then with cities like San Francisco, Chicago, DC, Philly actively avoiding police arrests of certain age and race demographics to avoid them \"ending up in the system\", you can see why some of these once great cities are struggling.     \n     \nHonestly, had I stayed in my small Midwest town forever, I would've probably had less reactionary, intrusive racist thoughts than I would have otherwise because racism was a relic of the past to many of us growing up.

Both sides are using **heavy** propaganda. And both sides are getting their propaganda reinforced by explosions. I'd probably hate a people if I were taught to in school every day, then heard the iron dome go off once or twice on my way home. I'd probably hate a people even more, if instead of the iron dome, I saw the bombs strike, saw buildings crumble, heard the screams of survivors.\n\nMostly, I want your answer on one question: Where does it end? When every Palestinian will have lost loved ones to indiscriminate bombings, will you expect them to want anything other than the eradication of Israel? And when every Palestinian wants the end of Israel, how will Israel choose to respond?\n\nAt the current trajectory, genocide is **the only** end I can see to this.

            "Its a tricky predicament, on the one hand Israel doesn't want Palestinians inside the border because of the security concern and leaving them on their own is only making the situation worse. The best case solution in my opinion is Israel taking over the Gaza and rebuilding under a liberal caring Israeli government that won't police and brutalize the Palestinian people until we can work things out because a people who want to destroy a country with every fiber of their being should not have their own government because though elected will only care about said countries destruction rather than boosting their economy or modernizing their infrastructure. \n\nI agree with a cease fire to bring the hostages but something has to be done about a military force hiding among a people waiting to cause as much damage as possible.\n\nWith Hamas in power Gaza is doomed. The fact that it is run by an extremist group automatically makes negotiations 10000X harder",

Even if it's extremely unlikely there's still a chance. Not my problem, not my place.  \n  \nThe comment:  \n  \n> This comment will get buried, but it's a story worth telling.\n\n>In college, my best friend and I had a summer job culling trees from a property 50kms (30miles) from the nearest hospital/ambulance station.  We both got the job at the same time and worked there for almost 3 summers in a team of 5 guys.  We were all very skilled with equipment and had been through extensive training.  Two of the guys on the team were professional arborists. We had all the gear, but as anyone with professional experience with chainsaws will tell you, unpredictable accidents can happen.\n\n>On a late August morning we had just finished downing a 30 foot white pine and were in the process of removing the branches.  My friend was working his way down the trunk when he hit a knot in an oddly formed branch and the chainsaw kicked and due to the admittedly awkward position he was in sliced into a seam between his chaps and his belt.\n\n>The blood started flowing immediately and everyone stopped.  While the others stabilized him, I ran to get my car knowing in any case we'd have to drive.  While trying to control the bleeding we loaded him into the back seat of my car and I started driving as fast as I could towards the nearest hospital. 10/50kms in we got cell coverage and arranged a place to meet the nearest ambulance.  I knew we had to get him in fast as we were having trouble controlling the bleeding. When I reached a 4 lane highway I started going faster than I had ever driven before.\n\n>While in the middle of nowhere most people would see me coming and move to the right lane (slower traffic keeping right), but as we got closer to town we started coming across packs.  It was 25/50kms to the hospital that we came across a white Nissan Altima and a Subaru Forester that blocked us in just like the OP likes to do.  I can still remember the license plates of those to cars to this day.  She was doing everything to ensure I didn't pass.  She slowed up down from 90-75km/h (speed limit is 100km/h - ~60mph).  We were stuck.  It was this way for a solid 10minutes. It wasn't until we got to the next exit ramp that I was able to pass on the inside and get by.  By this point most of our clothes had been used to help soak up the blood/applying pressure.  \n\n>Frustrated one of the guys threw a T-shirt that was dripping in blood out the window as we passed and hung out to give them a wave.  He, like all of us, was covered in blood. The blood soaked T-shirt landed midway up the hood of the white Altima leaving a streak as it slid/rolled up and over the windshield. \n\n>5kms (3 miles down the highway) we were joined by a highway patrol officer who matched our speed and helped to clear the way to the ambulance waiting a further 2 miles down the road.  By that point the bleeding had slowed and my friend had a very weak pulse.  The ambulance crew was ready and waiting and transferred him within seconds of our arrival.  I jumped into the ambulance and we all took off. Sadly the friend died a few minutes later, 1km from the hospital. \n\n>My friends were at the side of the road explaining the situation to the police officer when the white Altima showed up. I wasn't there for this part, so I'm going by the stories they told me.   Anyways, she stopped and approached the officer in such a way that she couldn't see the blood soaked guys. She was shouting about dangerous driving and going to kill someone, yadda yadda yadda.  The officer brought her around to look at the inside of my car which was covered in blood, and then pointed to the other two guys from my crew who were covered in blood from head to toe. He explained there was a medical emergency and asked if what we had said about her impeding the flow of traffic was correct.  He cited her for a number of things including unnecessarily slow driving and dangerous driving.  While he was writing the ticket he was informed of the death of my friend in the ambulance.  The guy stopped writing the ticket to come over and tell the guys what happened.  He opted to not tell the lady in the Altima, but the other guys on the team sure let her know.\n\n>The guys got in the car and came to meet me at the hospital where we were going to meet with police to explain the situation.  On the way they passed the Subaru Forester, which had been stopped by another officer.\n\n>Your best bet is to get out of the way if you can.  While the driver behind you may just be an asshole, it may also be someone with a medical emergency; a partner in labour, a child having a diabetic attack, or a tree surgeon bleeding to death.  In any case, letting them past you doesn't affect you in any way and may save a life.  These scenarios aren't likely, but they also aren't impossible.  It ultimately comes down to how you decide to process the situation.  If you want to operate on the default mode of assuming you're right and everyone else is wrong, you're going to have a terrible time functioning in society. Lines, traffic, call centers, and dealing with big business or government will always seem tedious to you.  On the other hand, if you can view the world from a more understanding perspective you'll be able to relax and stop being such a dick.  Have a good life!\n\n\n>Watch [this video (this is water)](https://youtu.be/eC7xzavzEKY), it isn't perfectly related, but the intentions of the OP are in line with someone who **hasn't** embraced this philosophy.  \n\n\n>________________\n>Edit: So this comment was reposted and I got a TON of messaging asking about the video link at the end.

            "Here's the chainsaw story for y'all. (NOT MY STORY.)\n\nIn college, my best friend and I had a summer job culling trees from a property 50kms (30miles) from the nearest hospital/ambulance station.  We both got the job at the same time and worked there for almost 3 summers in a team of 5 guys.  We were all very skilled with equipment and had been through extensive training.  Two of the guys on the team were professional arborists. We had all the gear, but as anyone with professional experience with chainsaws will tell you, unpredictable accidents can happen.\n\nOn a late August morning we had just finished downing a 30 foot white pine and were in the process of removing the branches.  My friend was working his way down the trunk when he hit a knot in an oddly formed branch and the chainsaw kicked and due to the admittedly awkward position he was in sliced into a seam between his chaps and his belt.\n\nThe blood started flowing immediately and everyone stopped.  While the others stabilized him, I ran to get my car knowing in any case we'd have to drive.  While trying to control the bleeding we loaded him into the back seat of my car and I started driving as fast as I could towards the nearest hospital. 10/50kms in we got cell coverage and arranged a place to meet the nearest ambulance.  I knew we had to get him in fast as we were having trouble controlling the bleeding. When I reached a 4 lane highway I started going faster than I had ever driven before.\n\nWhile in the middle of nowhere most people would see me coming and move to the right lane (slower traffic keeping right), but as we got closer to town we started coming across packs.  It was 25/50kms to the hospital that we came across a white Nissan Altima and a Subaru Forester that blocked us in just like the OP likes to do.  I can still remember the license plates of those to cars to this day.  She was doing everything to ensure I didn't pass.  She slowed up down from 90-75km/h (speed limit is 100km/h - ~60mph).  We were stuck.  It was this way for a solid 10minutes. It wasn't until we got to the next exit ramp that I was able to pass on the inside and get by.  By this point most of our clothes had been used to help soak up the blood/applying pressure.  \n\nFrustrated one of the guys threw a T-shirt that was dripping in blood out the window as we passed and hung out to give them a wave.  He, like all of us, was covered in blood. The blood soaked T-shirt landed midway up the hood of the white Altima leaving a streak as it slid/rolled up and over the windshield. \n\n5kms (3 miles down the highway) we were joined by a highway patrol officer who matched our speed and helped to clear the way to the ambulance waiting a further 2 miles down the road.  By that point the bleeding had slowed and my friend had a very weak pulse.  The ambulance crew was ready and waiting and transferred him within seconds of our arrival.  I jumped into the ambulance and we all took off. Sadly the friend died a few minutes later, 1km from the hospital. \n\nMy friends were at the side of the road explaining the situation to the police officer when the white Altima showed up. I wasn't there for this part, so I'm going by the stories they told me.   Anyways, she stopped and approached the officer in such a way that she couldn't see the blood soaked guys. She was shouting about dangerous driving and going to kill someone, yadda yadda yadda.  The officer brought her around to look at the inside of my car which was covered in blood, and then pointed to the other two guys from my crew who were covered in blood from head to toe. He explained there was a medical emergency and asked if what we had said about her impeding the flow of traffic was correct.  He cited her for a number of things including unnecessarily slow driving and dangerous driving.  While he was writing the ticket he was informed of the death of my friend in the ambulance.  The guy stopped writing the ticket to come over and tell the guys what happened.  He opted to not tell the lady in the Altima, but the other guys on the team sure let her know.\n\nThe guys got in the car and came to meet me at the hospital where we were going to meet with police to explain the situation.  On the way they passed the Subaru Forester, which had been stopped by another officer.\n\nYour best bet is to get out of the way if you can.  While the driver behind you may just be an asshole, it may also be someone with a medical emergency; a partner in labour, a child having a diabetic attack, or a tree surgeon bleeding to death.  In any case, letting them past you doesn't affect you in any way and may save a life.  These scenarios aren't likely, but they also aren't impossible.  It ultimately comes down to how you decide to process the situation.  If you want to operate on the default mode of assuming you're right and everyone else is wrong, you're going to have a terrible time functioning in society. Lines, traffic, call centers, and dealing with big business or government will always seem tedious to you.  On the other hand, if you can view the world from a more understanding perspective you'll be able to relax and stop being such a dick.  Have a good life!",

            "No shit, as in I'm pointing out that it's fake. Nothing about it is realistic or believable. I'm saying that I agree with you.",
            "I think you're embarassed that I figured it out before you.",
            "*You* should be embarrassed because I figured it out before you.",
            "What the kindergarten fuck are you on about? \"How WOULD he not,\" not \"How DID he not,\" dipshit. Implying that I'm not buying the bullshit. Do you need every single concept explicitly spelled out for you? Because there are therapies and pills for that.",
            "Telling someone else to take therapy. Ironic coming from someone who needs anger management. If you get this mad on the internet, i can\u2019t imagine irl. I just feel bad for your loved ones."
