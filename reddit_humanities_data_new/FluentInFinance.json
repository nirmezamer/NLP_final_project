        "content": "We've received many questions for **recommendations on books for Investing & the Stock markets.** We've curated a list of our 13 favorite books on Investing & the Stock Market, and explanations on what the books are about. I've learned a great deal from these books. All of these are by really great investing legends/ gurus. These books offer a few different approaches to the stock market. Different investment styles will help educate you on how to make successful long term investments, minimize risk, and analyze stocks more accurately. All of these books can be purchased used very cheaply ($1 to $5)!\n\nAs your income grows, your investment portfolio should also grow.

[You Can Be a Stock Market Genius](https://amzn.to/3meewnv) by Joel Greenblatt\n\n&#x200B;\n\n#  Book Descriptions & Covers:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**How to Make Money in Stocks**](https://amzn.to/3ujiApd) **by William O'Neil**\n\n* This book is about growth investing. O'Neil explains what most successful stocks have done to be successful. He explains his 'CANSLIM' method, which is an acronym for 7 fundamental criteria which you can use to pick stocks. An AAII 8 year study of different strategies showed O'Neal's CAN SLIM with a 860% return from 1998-2005 (Second place). First place was Martin Zwieg's returning 1,659.3% (we will get to Zweig on this list too)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xqsteucgng191.png?width=195&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce61da8980efdfe0ecef663ab05a97f4838182dc\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [The Little Book That Still Beats the Market](https://amzn.to/2OfR4d9) by Joel Greenblatt\n\n* The idea of this book is to buy undervalued good businesses and hold them long-term, which will eventually beat the market index.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qmrq2minng191.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=46dd18b57e2bdc7afb8fa1f5e1ff025615d16a76\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [A Random Walk Down Wall Street](https://amzn.to/3ud6E8A) by Burton G. Malkiel\n\n* This book covers investment bubbles, fundamental vs. technical analysis, modern portfolio theory, index funds, etc.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7t5gloong191.png?width=329&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d43edcd511ef371a506419cec2ac8462a7d844a\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Principles](https://amzn.to/3wk9CtU) by Ray Dalio\n\n* This book provides the insights from one of the biggest hedge fund managers of all time, and I think there are many great lessons to learn in this book!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cwv7dc4png191.png?width=333&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b5d86b9f669f59e1240f53628e59daf3ae97323\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [One Up On Wall Street](https://amzn.to/3rEN9E9) by Peter Lynch\n\n* This book emphasizes the advantages that individual investors hold over institutional investors (when it comes to finding investment opportunities). Lynch also gives many of examples of mistakes he has made, and how he has learned from them.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a3hze2lpng191.png?width=326&format=png&auto=webp&s=e94cbc8e20e50f7cd9b92a67c140952529bd0d04\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [The Big Secret for the Small Investor](https://amzn.to/3fHyJ3I) by Joel Greenblatt\n\n* Greenblatt explains why index funds can be better than actively managed funds. The big secret is maintaining a long term perspective!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qvhszg2qng191.png?width=347&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dc31f381276a372d5cb2eeb1c0afa91fb253454\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Winning on Wall Street](https://amzn.to/3rH4TyH) by Martin Zweig\n\n* Zweig's success came from his ability to predict the bigger picture (such as trends in the broader market). The combination of his stock picking skill, general market understanding, and market timing, made him one of the great investors of stock market history. Zweig was more interested in growth than value. Unlike Buffett, Zweig isn't a 'buy and hold' investor. An AAII 8 year study of different strategies showed Zwieg's returning 1,659.3% from 1998-2005. He was #1 out of 56 others, including Buffett, Lynch, Fisher, O'Neal's CAN SLIM, Motley fools, and using ROE, P/E's etc. Second place was O'Neal's CAN SLIM with a 860% return.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tysdlflqng191.png?width=313&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d8ce17fd8550c7fd873d563fa3b90cd82b8c005\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Irrational Exuberance](https://amzn.to/3mbTjKQ) by Robert Shiller\n\n* Shiller makes strong argument that perfect market theory is flawed. The Idea of perfect market theory is basically that the markets are all knowing and completely rational, and in the long run can't be beat. Therefore , you can control costs with index funds and diversification. (You can't beat the market, therefore controlling costs and diversifying seems like logical strategy)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l01rs20rng191.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=151c657fc6b320267ae031848aa220565c024e7b\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://amzn.to/3uaehfS)\n\n* The key concepts of this book are risk tolerance, asset allocation, a balanced portfolio, tax efficiency and cash management. This book explains many of the pitfalls of investing. The Bogleheads and Jack Bogle preach the power of compound interest. Investing in low-fee index funds and holding them long-term is the method. This book gives an excellent, detailed rundown of how to implement this kind of investment plan.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mqmzqqerng191.png?width=335&format=png&auto=webp&s=942f56ed1175ccb9c7e5652f647b7ad24dd17228\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Common Sense Investing](https://amzn.to/3ucV0dW) by John Bogle\n\n* Great information for anyone who is trying to make sense of personal finance and basic investments. This book explains why passive investing is a worry free, long-term strategy that consistency wins over time, and why active trading always returns to the mean.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h7aw2btrng191.png?width=354&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d706a714a567b2e59a27f840328cce4496408f0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [The Intelligent Investor](https://amzn.to/2PqdzMQ) by Benjamin Graham\n\n* This is a great book for anyone who is interested in introducing themselves into the world of investing, or wants to get better at investing. This book gives lots of valuable information to help one understand the basics of value investing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jux3a18sng191.png?width=325&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ca28ae1e0affb69e1c1717da5d18b86660c4642\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need](https://amzn.to/3ugMSJu) by Andrew Tobias\n\n* This is a book for people looking to learn the basics of investing and saving money\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8odacksng191.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1b6ef78987fd43e278b18f267c8ce8621ef4d5f\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [You Can Be a Stock Market Genius](https://amzn.to/3meewnv) by Joel Greenblatt\n\n* This is not a book for beginners. Greenblatt gives a nice exposition of some more \"special situation\" investment styles & areas of equity investments (mergers, spin-offs, rights offerings, etc.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mjm6kxzsng191.png?width=333&format=png&auto=webp&s=80d6fb469143339516c9012b6b7d60162ffab565",

            "Surprised to see Psychology of Money, and Millionaire Next Door missing. Also Benjamin Graham is an awful read, even though the ideas are great. You can find a better version of his teaching written for a broader audience in other books.",
            "Which one would you guys recomend as the starting one? Nothing too heavy ideally",
            "It would be awesome if some one picked the top 10 stocks according each book this year 2024 !!",
            "Recently finished the \"Principles\" by Ray Dalio  and it was a great read!\n\nBack in the days I read \"The Intelligent Investor\" by Benjamin Graham and it was a though read... may I should revisit it...",
            "Trading for a living by Alexander Elder \nThe disciplined trader & Trading in the zone by Mark Douglas\n\nThese should be on top of the list if you even consider trading. Everyone is capable of learning the fundamentals of basic trading and even the advanced trading techniques, but the market is never 100%, you\u2019re going to lose sometimes. You have to learn to manage your feelings. These books teach you the psychology behind trading. Having self awareness and discipline will help you to make better trades and retain your portfolio.",
            "I've read The Little Book and it's pretty good but I can't help but think that value trading is not the best idea in the current market.",
            "Great book to read-you won\u2019t believe it when you do.\n\nConfusion de La Confusions. 1688\n\nInvesting advice-buy the longest term options on the market you can afford.  People will always try to advance the market.",
            "I\u2019m gonna get Irrational Exuberance audiobook and listen to it",
            "Thanks for sharing..",
            "Add The Masters of Private Equity and Venture Capital to your list",
            "![img](avatar_exp|175728865|bravo)",
            "actually read The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing - good book tho, but probably outdated. you should pick some new ones since the markets are changing everyday",
            "You spoiled brats don't know what poverty is...\nHow many of you idiots have ever lived in another country?  If you did you would know how easy your life compatlred 95% of the world.  \n\nIf you want nice things, get real skill sets that apply to the job industry outside fast food!",
            "Thank you for making this list.",
            "Bogle's Common Sense Investing has been my fav . It prompted me to start investing back in 1987 when most funds required 3k or 5k to start Vanguard Star fund could be started for $1000 . in my 20's i coundnt afford to buy a fund for 3k but Bogle made Star fund an affordable gateway fund for invester to get started and be in the market. I still invest in STAR fund  and also Wellington and in a total market fund from Fidelity FZROX.",
            "Great list. Read all of these solid foundation.",
            "Graham is all you really need (besides loosing few k$ on options:\\] )",
            "ok",
            "what books would your recommend that capture graham's ideas?",
            "It\u2019s not on the list but I thoroughly enjoyed \u201cpsychology of money\u201d it\u2019s not too heavy and it\u2019s a great start to understanding more about how people think when money is involved",
            "Good question!",
            "Start with classics if you know nothing. A radmon walk down wall street is great. The chapters on margin of saftey is still the gold standard and maybe the most important investing concept that nobody seems to want to follow.\n\nGranted I have only read two of these but both are top notch based on the research out there. But its a great list. If you want to get into real estate investing Irrational Exuberance is the gold standard as far as I consider. His ideas hyper apply to real estate markets. I mean he created the Rober-Shiller Index which is the index for the housing market.",
            "Actually the version they show there is a great version - it is annotated by Jason Zweig. Yes, the original Graham book is dry and a boring read, but Zweig annotates every paragraph and makes them relevant. Also, the original book is from 1949 and while the principles apply, it\u2019s super dated. Zweig gives recent examples and shows how the advice still applies today.",
            "Thanks for the tip! Will look that one up"

No more money flooding into lawyers pockets. No more malpractice insurance to pay out giant settlements.\n\nGet rid of health insurance and make cost available upfront. Insurance is a business model that is incentivized to not do the very thing that you pay them to do. Most businesses take their revenue and spend it on the supplies and labor necessary to provide goods and services to the consumer. Insurance takes your money for doing nothing, and spends it on trying to find ways to deny your claims so they can keep it. Dumb system.\n\nThe primary reason healthcare is expensive in this country is because of insurance. Insurance haggle with hospitals over what percent of a claim they are willing to pay, and the hospital often eats the rest of the cost. If a hospital gives you a medication that cost them $1 to get, they will charge the insurance company $100 to get $5. If they charge the insurance company $5, they will only pay 25 cents. So the hospital charges to $100 to get $5, but if you don't have insurance then you still get a bill for $100. These are fake prices, and need to stop.",

This is due primarily to people with health risks not living as long (healthcare for the elderly is exceptionally expensive), as well as reduced spending on pensions, income from sin taxes, etc.. \n\nIn the US there are 106.4 million people that are overweight, at an additional lifetime healthcare cost of $3,770 per person average. 98.2 million obese at an average additional lifetime cost of $17,795. 25.2 million morbidly obese, at an average additional lifetime cost of $22,619.

Obesity prevention may be an important and cost-effective way of improving public health, but it is not a cure for increasing health expenditures...In this study we have shown that, although obese people induce high medical costs during their lives, their lifetime health-care costs are lower than those of healthy-living people but higher than those of smokers. Obesity increases the risk of diseases such as diabetes and coronary heart disease, thereby increasing health-care utilization but decreasing life expectancy. Successful prevention of obesity, in turn, increases life expectancy. Unfortunately, these life-years gained are not lived in full health and come at a price: people suffer from other diseases, which increases health-care costs. Obesity prevention, just like smoking prevention, will not stem the tide of increasing health-care expenditures.\n\nhttps://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/46007081/Lifetime_Medical_Costs_of_Obesity.PDF\n\nFor further confirmation we can look to the fact that healthcare utilization rates in the US are similar to its peers. \n\nhttps://www.oregonlegislature.gov/salinas/HealthCareDocuments/4.%20Health%20Care%20Spending%20in%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Other%20High-Income%20Countries%20JAMA%202018.pdf\n\nOne final way we can look at it is to see if there is correlation between obesity rates and increased spending levels between various countries.

S'good.\n\nYou didn't need coverage for a doctor office visit.  \nThat might cost a mere $2 in the mid-1950s. Yes, really.  \nThat's around $22 today.\n\nBut a half century ago we got into the habit of wanting and expecting coverage for nearly every medical event.  \nAnd where there's a vast pool of money to pay for things, there are hands open to taking it. Prices skyrocketed.\n\nWe need to ELIMINATE medical insurance.  \nThat's not easy. That's REALLY difficult.  \nBut I see no alternative.",

If one party causes another party harm the harmed party will always be able to sue for damages, even if the harming party is found not guilty in a criminal trial.

Doctors actually take a vow that prohibits them from behaving like health care executives!  What executives can - and did - compete with effectively was bribery and corruption to lock out their biggest potential competitors from entering the playing field.\n\nThe point isn't to compete for the best health care - its to compete for the maximum amount of profit at the bare minimum deliverable amount of health care possible.  This isn't just how ownership of hospitals works - they also have price fixing built in to insurance schemes to make sure prices remain high and health care doesn't get too affordable.

Starting 2024, they have now demanded that an RD get a master's degree.  There's no reason an RD should need a master's in order to work.  All they have done is prolonged students from getting into the workforce and causing them to obtain more debt.\n\nThe accreditation agencies also require bullshit filler classes instead of streamlining.  When I was obtaining my nursing degree I had to take BS electives that had nothing to do with learning the skills I would need when I entered the workforce.  Eliminating those BS classes would have allowed me to graduate 1 year earlier and with less student loan debt.\n\nIf the Biden administration could meet with the accreditation agencies and instruct them to cut out the requirements that are not directly useful for the job requirements.",

The FDA didn\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat company, Abbott Nutrition, remains one of the largest infant formula manufacturers. \u201cNobody from that company was sent to prison. Nobody was fired.\u201d Yet this factory \u2013 a factory supplying one-fifth of the US\u2019s baby formula \u2013 was being run \u201cin completely unsanitary conditions.
