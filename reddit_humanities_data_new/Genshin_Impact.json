            "Moment of Syzygy is getting the red exclamation mark everyday.  I already did the abyss this cycle (only 33 stars but w/e) any reason why I am getting the exclamation mark every day even if I cleared the mark yesterday?",
            "is anyone else seeing accounts named \u2019111\u2019 that also have a lumine profile picture? I\u2019ve seen at least 5 today when looking for co-op worlds to join and I\u2019m just wondering what it is (America server btw) \n\n  \n((update: they are mostly level 25-35 from what I\u2019ve seen))",
            "If Furina had a counterpart in the Honkai universe (Honkai Impact 3rd and Honkai: Star Rail), who would it be?",
            "Hey guys so i just came back to playing after almost a year of break and i want to rebuild my acc, which artifact domain is much more efficient? EoSF, GilDream, Maracheusser (whatever that artifact name is). Mainly my goal is to build furina, yelan, and if the other artifact set can be used by my other units like yae, kuki, fischl or whatever then i can put them on that piece. Thankyou!!",
            "Changing from phone to pc (laptop), what should I take note of?",
            "A friend of mine gave me his account cus he has like thousands of them and i wanted to explore new characters, so I open his account and see neuvi and kazuha, I started looking for furina and fishcl and didn't found them but instead I found xingqui raiden and yae, so now i am using neuvi, kazu, xq, raiden. Does this team work? I haven't done much research on neuvi",
            "I wanted to ask if am the only one lagging in Sumeru because before 4.7 I were doing fine in Sumeru without lag now even the sound suthering i don't understand why this happening i don't have any problem with the others region\u00a0",
            "Should I pull for furina or alhaitham? My characters are kazuha cyno keqing and the only decent healer I have is Bennett (c0)",
            "I took a break from the game since sumeru (so i obviously don't have any character past sumeru), who should i go for Alhaithem or Clorinde, they're both cool looking so i'm fine with getting whoever\n\nCharacter of note that i do have is : Zhongli, Kazuha, Raiden, Venti, Yelan, Hu Tao, Kokomi, Ayaka,etc... That said i don't have any dendro character aside from traveler",
            "Sorry for dumb question \n\nBut I really want to know how I can get 4 five stars character of my choice asap\n\nSo, I came back to genshin again after almost 3 years and I don't know where my new account is, so started with a fresh account recently \n\nNow I have played genshin back then, for a year before leaving and I had 6-7 five star characters\nAnd without paying anything \nPlus 4-5 weapons by welkins and battle pass I bought \n(Yes I was really lucky) \n\nSo now I don't really care about collecting characters anymore, however having 3 or 4 is quite a necessity, otherwise the game feels boring after a while.\nWith those 3-4 characters you can pretty much complete the whole game. Well that's exactly what I used to do.  \n\nSo, now the game has much more content than it had back then , so I want to know the fastest route to get my choice of characters\nAlso, I can buy welkins too\nNot crystals tho, those are scams",
            "I got 36 stars but it still gets remarked. Idk, mihoyo broke something",
            "The latest patch broke a few notification errors, which they have since fixed, but this is a new one. \n\n\nI guess they missed it because it's the first full month Abyss, so we didn't get to see this issue until now. I would expect it to be fixed some time in the near-ish future.",
            "Do golden troupe for furina, yea, and fischl and strongbox emblem for yelan",
            "ig furina and neuvi share same domain for artifacts so that domain is the best, also gilded is still one of the best if you are using dendro based teams",
            "hold Alt to make mouse appear when you want to press buttons on screen? cant think of anything else",
            "Raiden can work but not optimal. Miko would work better unless you are playing hyperbloom. Xingqiu absolutely does not work since his rain swords trigger on NA while Neuvillette spams CA. Double hydro Neuvillette is also not advisable unless he is C1 or the other hydro is Furina. Better to bring along a shielder instead.",
            "Furina is soon, Fischl is in starglitter shop in july",
            "Furina works well with Noelle who will be on the banner, and some other off field dps\n\n or on a team with Gaming and Bennett, youd want Xianyun ideally, or another healer, but Barbara works if you really lack options\n\nAlhaitham would like Xingqiu/Yelan optionally for hyperbloom  and off field electro for quicken or hyperbloom. you only mentioned on field electro",
            "Lowkey neither...? Or Furina and just plan to get more healers.\n\nAlhaitham is great, he's one of my favorite characters to play, but Cyno and Keqing will want a LOT of the same supports he wants and they'll end up fighting over teams.  \nI think you could use a main DPS who *isn't* locked into dendro-related teams, or some more 5\\* supports.\n\nEven with just Bennett (and ofc if you have or get Charlotte, Mika, Jean, Kuki, and even Barbara) Furina is quite strong, and she's used on Cyno's best team if you want to work towards building it. Or just wait and get a character in 4.8 or 5.0.",
            "Alhaitham is generally stronger, so I'd recommend him if you like them equally/don't prefer one's gameplay over the other's.",
            "if you have Raiden/Kuki and Xingqiu/Yelan, Alhaitham might be the better choice for easy hyperbloom\n\nboth like Nahida\n\nClorinde best teams tend to include Nahida and Fischl (starglitter shop in July). Alhaitahm quicken teams as well though\n\nbut for Clorinde i personally went for Chevreuse overload team who is one of the rare cases of (pyro and electro only)  res shred that isnt anemo, with Thoma who's on the banner, and Fischl. basically the character trial team. \n\ndo the character trials",
            "For Clorinde, DMC is already enough. and you also have Collei whos good enough \n\npair with a second electro(generally not Raiden) and an anemo, most commonly",
            "there isnt a fast way\n\nyou gather and wait. thats it.\n\nsome characters can take a year or more to come again",
            "oki ig ill be stuck in that domain for months:)",
            "can you explain why raiden doen't work, and also don't i need another hydro for the hydro resonance to increase his hp and give him some er",
            "I have Xingqiu and Yelan but their both kinda glue to Hu Tao and Zhongli now, are there any alternative for hydro like kokomi in case i need 1 side to have Hu Tao team",
            "Outside of hyperbloom Raiden's off field damage is very bad, and you have no dendro so no hyperbloom.  \nYae or *tbh* likely even Lisa can do more purely off field damage than Raiden's skill on taser.\n\nNeuvillette has a passive where (at c0) he wants the team to trigger three *unique* hydro reactions to buff his damage, and maxing out that passive will do a lot more for him than the hp buff from hydro resonance. Furina's buff is strong enough to make up for it, but without her double hydro is usually kinda bad for him at c0.\n\nNeuv + Kazuha + Yae + any shielder (Zhongli, Layla, Diona, Kirara etc) should work better.",
            "the best alternative would be furina, who is running next. You could use her inb either team to replace one of the hydro's. \n\nkokomi is a fair bit worse, but not completely unusable with alhaitham. You could also just go for a spread team for alhaitham instead of hyperbloom.",
            "Kokomi is pretty much never used alone as a hydro slot unless shes the on fielder which doesnt work with Alhaitham\n\ncould just go for Quicken with some electros",
            "ohk thanks I understand now, so what artifacts should i use for taser yae",
            "alright Alhaithem and Furina it is, thanks",
            "Ideally 4p golden troupe, crit electro% atk%. If that set isn't available then just use 2p2p combos with those same main stats (golden troupe, atk% sets, TF all work).\n\nShe still has some EM scaling but without dendro it's not enough to prioritize EM over attack. Her burst is also *nice*, but on this team most of her damage is from her skill, so don't bother building ER. Just burst every other rotation/whenever it's available and focus on her skill.",
            "Cool, though I probably should have mentioned in case you aren't familiar with her kit, furina has a teamwide hp drain mechanic so she will make the teams survivability worse. She is often used with teamwide healers because they help her stack her buff more/faster. But she is still good in that alhaitham team even without one. It will be less comfy due to the hp drain though.\n\nAs a sidenote, if you do pull furina still, kokomi furina kazuha yelan is also a pretty strong and comfy team.",
            "oh i see thanks"

            "\\[Alhaitham/Furina\\]\n\nI have a bit of choice paralysis here. Mostly F2P here (if you don't count Welkin Moon which I don't), started really playing heavily right when Sumeru dropped and took a very long break from the game. Please note that I'm still in post-Liyue progression (I'm exploring that one area with all the lotus leaves and stuff now) so I have lot of world to explore.  \n  \nI have C0 Diluc as my main damage dealer (lost pity on Ayako a long time ago), C3 Diona, C2 Sucrose, C0 Xingqiu as my main team (occasionally swapping in C0 Bennett for one of those). Waiting in the wings for when I finally get off my ass and progress through Inazuma: C0 Nahida, C1 Kuki, C1 Xiangling, C2 Faruzan.  \n  \nI have a couple of other C0's/C1's that aren't really remarkable/I don't have any interest in, or from what I gather they all require teams that I don't have. (C1 Mika, C0 Layla (who seems great but only at higher Constellations), C0 Yun Jin, C0 Gorou, C0 Collei, C0 Barbara, C0 Candace, C0 Lynette, C1 Dori).  \n  \nI'm not counting chars like Lisa/Noelle/Amber b/c lol no. All that being said who should I roll for? I'm leaning toward Furina since she seems to be pretty universally used in a lot of teams but I really don't know if I should just go for Alhaitham instead.",

            "Hi! I'm quite lost here after quitting for about 2 years.\n\nQuestions are:\n\n1. I'm very outdated on team building. Given I don't like 2 current banners, who in 4.8 should I target? (I've guarantee in stock) For background, my main DPS was Ganyu and I have Noelle and Razor built (lvl 80). For support, I've FIshcl, Barbara, Diona, Qiqi, Bennette. Xingqiu is half-built.\n\nMy others 5\\* are: Yae Miko, Raiden, Wanderer, Ito and Jean. Most of them are from my short comeback \"pull for fun\" so not built at all).\n\n2. In order to built newer characters, I've to go to so many places that haven't unlocked yet. Can I go straight (walk) to them or they are locked behind story quest?\n\n3. Is there any good guide for \"comeback\" player? So many things to do and I don't know which to focus first.\n\n4. I'm at the beginning of chapter 2 (next destination is Inazuma). How far until I get Dendro MC? \n\n  \n-- \n\nedited - correct words, and add 4.",

Should Clorinde use Thundering Fury or Harmonic Whimsey?\n2. Should DMC be built with enough ER to burst every time she is on field?\n3. Is Sucrose's best in slot weapon for a team like this TTDS?\n4. If Harmonic Whimsey is optimal what is the best rotation? DMC EQ, Fischl E or Q (whichever isn't on cooldown), Sucrose E, Clorinde Q then her E combo until it runs out? I'm guessing Sucrose should only ever burst if Clorinde doesn't have enough energy recharge so you need to stall for a second to get her skill back up.",

Chlorinde has high electro application and just decent talent damage which makes her ideal in Aggravate teams.

Down the line replace DMC with Nahida (if you want her) Bennett with either an anemo off-fielder or Furina (I personally don't like them but they are objectively good) and Lisa with Fischl (the most important replacement).\n\nIf you have any More questions I'd love to answer",

Zhongli or an electro healer is ideal, but Barbara or anyone else who won\u2019t ruin reactions is fine (just probably avoid pyro).\n\nIf you get Kuki (or Raiden) you can start running hyperbloom teams with him, with hydro units like Xingqiu. Getting Yaoyao, Kirara, or Baizhu will also open up more teams. Also consider getting Nahida, since she\u2019s a huge upgrade over dendro traveler.",
            "1. (long answer sorry lots to cover) We only *just* got some leaks on the leak subreddit about 4.8 banners, so info about that here: >!we're getting **Emilie** (a new dendro character who specializes in burning teams), **Navia** (a Fontaine geo DPS who *doesn't* want mono geo teams and does skill nukes on a short cooldown), **Nilou** (great AoE team enabler if you run all dendro + hydro), and **Yelan** (5 star Xingqiu). Out of those, Yelan can be good on a variety of teams, Navia is a fun DPS if you like her, and I'd avoid Nilou since she needs good dendro characters to work. Emilie could be *interesting*, since she'll likely work great on burnmelt teams! If you like her design, you could play melt Ganyu with her + some pyro/anemo supports.!< All that said, you could *also* go for Furina in the second half of 4.7. Furina is a strong hydro sub DPS and an *incredible* buffer, and she likes to be paired with healers. Jean, Barbara, Noelle, and in some cases Bennett will all work very well with her, and she's very likely the most \"top meta\" character rerunning between now and 4.8. You could *also* just wait for 5.0 and see what the new region has to offer.\n2. The only *entire* region in the game that's locked behind a quest is Inazuma, so you can build Sumeru and Fontaine characters just by walking there. For Arlecchino specifically, her world boss is locked behind the first \\~15 minutes or so of a world quest, but you don't need to finish the whole thing to get to it. Some sub-regions are questlocked, but you don't need to enter them to gather mats.\n3. Not that I know of! Keqingmains remains the best guide for building characters, but in terms of what new content to focus on (exploration/story etc) it's really up to you. I'd start with the main archon quest plotline to get caught up and be able to do limited time events without being spoiled, then backtrack and do exploration, world quests, and character story quests in whatever order interests you.",

            "Actually, I think they can work together. Beidou's ultimate will trigger when normal/charged attacks land, and Clorinde's skill should count as a normal attack. So you can run them together and worry less about defensive utility thanks to the damage reduction from Beidou. \n\nYou should be able to use Xingqiu as well for a taser comp, since his ultimate triggers when you perform a normal attack (it was shown in her collected miscellany). \n\nThen you could either run a dendro unit to add hyperbloom/mayybe aggravate or an anemo unit for grouping/resistence shredding.",

You can clear the game with sub-par teams quite easily right now, after all, so may as well invest in characters you'll still want to play even once you have more options.\n\nIf you find Xiangling's energy needs annoying or just want to play someone else, you can replace her with Yanfei on the same team.\n\nYou can also try Kaeya Xiangling Lynette Bennett with Kaeya as the main damage dealer triggering melt, if you're a fan of his.\n\nFinally, Beidou Fischl Xingqiu Bennett can be a fun taser team if you're a fan of those characters.\n\nBeidou, Kaeya, Fischl, and Xiangling all work notably well with Bennett since they can \"snapshot\" his attack buff and keep it even if they leave the circle/his burst expires.",

You can use him a few different ways.\n\nIf you're using full EM main stats and focusing on his swirl + chain reaction damage, Mappa Mare (or Sacrificial Fragments) will be better.  \nIf you're focusing on his raw anemo damage (building him with attack and crit) and just triggering swirl on the side, then Solar Pearl will be a very big boost to his DPS.\n\nWolf Fang is also great for Alhaitham, and Alhaitham is generally a stronger character than Heizou, so if you're torn I say start by upgrading him since it'll give you a stronger overall team. (On the other hand though if your Alhaitham team is doing great but your Heizou team is struggling, upgrading Heizou's weapon may help him *catch up*, so it depends what you value rn).",

Furina will be running with jean, as her buffing requires a strong healer to enable the buffs.

It's a good habit to get into.\n\nFor Clorinde teams specifically, Clorinde's skill duration is actually very short! Shorter than most DPS characters, so you *definitely* want to switch off of her as soon as she starts doing physical damage, which is a great time to summon Oz again.  \nWith Fischl, you also generally alternate between summoning Oz with her skill and her burst, so your rotation would look like:  \nSet up supports, summon Oz with E, Clorinde, refresh other support effects if they've expired, summon Oz with Q, Clorinde again.  \nIf you're using Nahida and Furina you only need to use their abilities once at the beginning, but if you're using characters like Collei, Kazuha, or Sucrose you'll want to use them twice just like Fischl.",
            "If you manage to put oz in a good place you dont need to move him again, tends to have a decent range even if you move a bit away.\n\nBut if you consider this for overload teams, i did this current abyss with clorinde-xiangling-beidou-chevreuse, where beidou (with decent er, near 200) can be totally fine considering her burst will trigger with your E-normal attacks. \n\nIts just anorther option if you want to try it. Beidous burst does quite some dmg, so is a good alternative to fischl.",
            "Personally I\u2019d use:\n\nAlhaitham - Fischl - Dendro Traveler - Zhongli\n\nSucrose - Xingqiu - Xiangling - Bennett\n\nIf you get Yaoyao, Kirara, or Kuki you\u2019ll unlock some other team options for Alhaitham, but for right now that\u2019s what I\u2019d recommend. Both teams are fairly popular and should be pretty strong if built well.",
            "It depends what supports you have. If you want to link a picture of your roster I can give more ideas, but the teams below should be a decent starting point.  \nFYI, Nahida can be replaced by dendro traveler in any team she's listed in if you don't have her. Collei also works, but imo feels a bit worse for Alhaitham.  \nKirara can also be used in the Yaoyao/Baizhu slot, but only if you *aren't* running Furina.\n\nIf you have Kuki or Raiden and a full EM build available for them, running *quickbloom* (with a mix of quicken and hyperbloom) is often his best team:  \nAlhaitham - Nahida - Kuki - Furina/Yelan/Xingqiu  \nor Alhaitham - Furina/Yelan/Xingqiu - Raiden - Yaoyao/Baizhu\n\nIf you *don't* have Raiden/Kuki, then you should run a pure quicken team, or a \"spread\" team (which is the dendro version of aggravate).  \nAlhaitham - Fischl/Yae - Nahida - Zhongli (or another healer/shielder)  \nAlhaitham - Fischl - Yae/Beidou/Sucrose - Baizhu/Yaoyao\n\nBloom is only worth running if you have Nilou.",
            "Any character you run on that team can use basically the same build: ideally a Marechaussee Hunter vape DPS build.\n\nGive him a pyro% goblet and a crit circlet, 4p MH, and balance his stats around all the free crit rate you get from running MH and Furina.  \nAn attack% sands and an EM sands both work, but with Bennett and Xianyun I'd say EM is more valuable. Choose whichever one has better substats though, and consider running an EM weapon if you use an attack sands and are lacking EM substats.\n\nAny crit polearm will obviously work great, but if you want *non*-crit options:  \nDragon's Bane, especially at r5, is fantastic and maybe his best option that isn't crit  \nLithic spear is solid if you have it, with two stacks of the passive  \nMissive Windspear and Kitain Cross are your craftable f2p options",
            ">Clorinde is not doing much damage with atk% sands but when I swapped it with hp% she started doing a bit better.\n\nClorinde has no damage at all in her kit that scales with HP%, so something else is going on here. HP is useless for her, and her attack on her current build is extremely low.  \nYou may have had different buffs when you compared damage, or may be misunderstanding something else about her kit (or comparing crit damage to non crit damage or something), but *definitely* don't run HP.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Raiden and Clorinde basically do the *same* thing \u2014 they're both on field electro main DPS \u2014 so they don't work well together. You'd probably get more out of your team replacing one of them with Fischl or Xiangling, since as-is they'll just be fighting over field time.\n\nClorinde's best teams are also *aggravate* teams, which include dendro. You can run her in Chev overload comps, but imo you may as well run Raiden with overload and Chev with aggravate so you can have independent teams for both of them.\n\nThere's some good info on Clorinde's build and teams here: [https://keqingmains.com/q/clorinde-quickguide/](https://keqingmains.com/q/clorinde-quickguide/)",
            "Gaming and Clorinde together is a bad idea.  \nThey're both main DPS and neither one of them does anything off field, so they'll just be fighting over who gets to be the real DPS.  \nSethos is ALSO a main DPS, so he won't be any better unfortunately.\n\nTbh I wouldn't *really* recommend overload teams for Clorinde if you aren't using Chevreuse. You can see some resources about her teams here: [https://keqingmains.com/q/clorinde-quickguide/#Teams](https://keqingmains.com/q/clorinde-quickguide/#Teams)  \nHer best teams all involve dendro, currently, but she has other options.",

If you have Baizhu, Yaoyao or Kirara to fill the role of dendro support *and* defense you can bring both, and electro resonance will let you generate some extra energy.\n\nAvoid Sara, her buff doesn\u2019t last long and she has zero off field electro.",
            "Right now I\u2019d say your best option might be a Tighnari team! He\u2019s a pretty strong single target DPS.\n\nTighnari + Fischl + dendro traveler (using the deepwood memories set to shred resistance) + a defensive option of your choice, like Barbara or Noelle.\n\nSucrose + Xingqiu + Xiangling + Bennett is a fantastic team, but without Bennett it\u2019ll be a lot weaker, and Xiangling will also need to build a *lot* of energy which can be annoying.",
            "Keqing + Fischl + Collei/dendro traveler + Barbara can work. Ideally you\u2019d use anemo instead of Barbara, but that leaves you with no healer. If you like Sethos or Lisa more they can replace Keqing.\n\nNeuvillette + Furina is an amazing core, and you can put a LOT of things in the last two slots. Kaeya, Lynette, dendro, and Fischl all work, or Xiangling or Lisa with the caveat that they need a lot of ER on that team. Noelle isn\u2019t awful if you need a shield. Try to bring 2 different elements that aren\u2019t hydro to stack Neuv\u2019s passive, and bring healing/shielding if needed.\n\nBarbara + Furina + Xiangling + Bennett is also a pretty solid vaporize team, and Xiangling + Bennett is a great core in general. Bennett has issues until c1 though, be warned.",
            "The other comment lists some good options, but just wanted to add:\n\nSethos - Fischl - Dendro traveller - Flex \n\nSethos is relatively easy to build and pretty good at C0. Just give him Slingshot and 4pc Wanderer's Troupe (or 2pc2pc EM/Electro if you don't have a 4pc set).",

I\u2019d go with Kaeya, since otherwise you\u2019re running 3 healers.\n\nNingguang, Bennett, Geo Traveler, and a flex slot to fill with whoever you want would also be decent.\n\nThat said, with that few characters I *really* wouldn\u2019t worry about building the best team possible. I recommend you just focus on leveling up characters you genuinely enjoy, so that once you have enough options to make better teams they\u2019re ready for you. Bennett, Yaoyao, and Kuki are prob your strongest characters right now, but they\u2019re all healers, so maybe pick one of them and just add damage dealers you enjoy, for now.",

            "Still testing out clorinde, but theres some teams where she fits well:\n\nClorinde-Electro-anemo-dendro as a classic aggravate team.\n\nClorinde-electro-hydro-hydro/anemo/zhongli for an electrocharge team\n\nClorinde-electro-hydro-dendro for hyperbloom\n\nClorinde-electro-doble pyro for overload.\n\n  \nElectro choices are mostly fischl, good ER builded beidou, yae or kuki. In general, and outfield electro applicator.\n\nHydros are mostly outfield applicators. XQ,Furina, yelan, even kokomi.\n\nAnemos are there to use vv set and shred def. Kazu is top, but sucrouse or other ones are ok for the role too.\n\nDendros need to constat apply outfield dendro. Nahida, kirara (probably c4), yaoyao, dmc....\n\nIn this abyss rotation i used in the first half overload with 2 pyros. Xiangling is probably top for the constant application, but because clorinde moves around alot, its not always viable to use bennet, and using chevreuse, dehya, or thoma are ok picks too.\n\nYou didnt metion your roster, but with those guidlines you should be able to built a team around her. Al teams are decent, the only thing i want to notice (as main beidou), is that clorinde in E \"stance\", her attacks are considered normal attacks, which trigger beidous burst, xq burst, yelan burst.... Which is a good point for a big outfield subdps characters.\n\nAbout geo, leave it for now. The only \"great units\" are navia and zhongli. You can made a superpowerfull noelle MH set with furina and gorou, but requires C6 noelle. Other than that, most of geos are usually use on monogeo which is not a really good team.\n\nYour current teams are totally fine, so if you manage to accomodate a new one for clorinde will be better, letting you have a 4th good team.",
            "Personally I wouldn't use a shielder at all!\n\nEven on a full EM build Kuki heals for quite a bit (if you level her skill up), and Xingqiu is already providing decent stagger resistance and damage reduction. I'd prefer Nahida, Dendro MC, or Collei in the last slot.\n\nIf you feel more comfortable with a shielder, I'd *probably* still use Zhongli tbh...? Dendro resonance is nice, but Zhongli also has universal resistance shred which is imo nicer than a small EM buff, and he can hold Deepwood even if the 2p effect is useless.  \nZhongli may have issues with Deepwood uptime if his pillar gets destroyed, but Kirara *also* has issues with uptime unless she's c4+. If she *is* c4, you like her, and you find it annoying to manage Zhongli's pillar (or if you'd just rather keep him on a different set for your other teams), then go with Kirara, but Zhongli should get you more damage if you *can* consistently apply the Deepwood effect with him.",

Just walk to Sumeru and interact with a Statue, unlike Inazuma you can go there any time.\n\nFor your healer/shielder, I'd probably use Barbara, since a *little* hydro isn't a bad thing and she can hold TTDS to buff Alhaitham or Fischl, but Diona, Qiqi, and Jean are all decent too. None of them are the *best* option (which is Zhongli or an electro healer), but they're all fine.\n\nIf you get Kuki (or Raiden) then you can use Xingqiu and run quickbloom/hyperbloom comps, and if you get Yaoyao, Kirara, or Baizhu you can easily run a second electro sub DPS alongside Fischl (such as Beidou).  \nBut for now, stick to a simple spread team with Fischl, a dendro support, and a defensive option.\n\nMake sure to give your dendro support the 4p deepwood memories set to shred resistance.  \nAlhaitham will ideally be on 4p Gilded Dreams, but 2p2p combos work too.  \nFischl will ideally be on 4p Golden Troupe, but 2p2p are fine for her as well.  \nBuild your healer/shielder as you normally would.\n\nMore information here: [https://keqingmains.com/q/alhaitham-quickguide/](https://keqingmains.com/q/alhaitham-quickguide/)",

If you insist on using him in that team, how much em and on who depends on the reactions. If you generally have a Dendro aura, build him like normal. If it's a hydro aura most of the time, try to shoot for 200 more em than normal. Though honestly it might be more damage if you instead switched the hydro to one that applies slower.",

Dendro is ideally Nahida, the second best option is DMC and it isn't that much worse. The electro slot is ideally Fischl, but second is Yae, third is Beidou (c2+ and not single target), 4th is Lisa, it is worth noting that the gap between Fischl and Yae is much bigger than the gap between Yae and Lisa.

For Arle, you can go for her, Chevy, Bennet, and Fischl (get her next month from star glitter shop) or pull Furina, replace Xingqui with her in your Alhaitham team, and go her, bennet, Xingqui, and Sucrose. Of course outside of abyss you can just use Xingqui in both but if you do get Furina the difference between her and Xingqui is close and they do slightly different things, so it would be up to preference. For pull recommendations, Furina is a good choice, generally you are better off having at least 2 off-field hydro appliers on your account, so many teams need that skill set. If you miss her Yelan would be a good choice as well. Direct upgrades to the teams I've talked about would be Nahida for Alhaitham, and Kazuha for Arle, beyond that it's getting into new team entirely territory. \n\nNote on what the other guy said, you are not in a position to worry about imaginarium theater yet, focus on overworld first, then abyss, and only then use resin to fill out for imaginarium.",

For rotations, if TF have him look it up, it's better to learn from a video, for Whimsy however, simply go Clorinde Q if available, Nahida EQ, Fischl E or Q, Kazuha QE, and back to Clorinde for her e and repeat.",

Furina just doesn't use the mistsplitter very well despite the elemental dmg and crit dmg. In addition, it's forcing you to run ER sands or else you're not meeting her ER requirements, meaning lowering your HP for more potential damage than what you \"gained\" with the mistsplitter.

Any electro DPS + Fischl and dendro is a potent combo.\n\nYou can look up \u201crational \u201craiden hyperbloom\u201d and \u201craiden aggravate\u201d online for video examples of how the teams play, if you want to get a sense for them.",
            "Eula/Raiden/Nahida/Kokomi or Yelan. Use Nahida's skill, Kokomi skill or Yelan's skill+burst, Raiden's skill, then just attack with Eula. Very straight-forward. You could also use Neuvillette/Fischl/Beidou/Anyone you want. I'd recommend Kazuha for the last slot since he reduces sprinting stamina and basically has a double jump (good for overworld exploration) and can buff some damage.",
            "If you really want the build to be interchangeable best option is probably to farm deepwood and strongbox either clam or tenacity. If you\u2019re playing any team that deals dendro damage, you definitely need to pick deepwood, and it\u2019s generally the number 1 pick for Baizhu and Yaoyao\n\nIn terms of the strongbox, if you really want an interchangeable build, you\u2019d probably strongbox clam, since it\u2019s useable on both Yaoyao and Baizhu. I\u2019d personally recommend tenacity though since it\u2019s useful on way more characters than clam is. Issue with that is that 4pc Tenacity is useless on Baizhu, the 2pc is fine though. Pick whichever you think suits your needs more.",
            "Klee/Bennett/Xiangling/Zhongli can take on anything that's not immune to pyro. If you don't want to run Klee, Diluc/Bennett/Xingqiu/Sucrose is good as well.

If you're struggling to deal with enemies, it may be less a team issue and more a build issue. Leveling up your weapons, character talents, and artifacts can help a *lot*. You can't farm endgame artifacts until ar45, but you can still look for pieces with useful main stats like atk% and elemental damage% and level them up (you can use them as fodder to level up better pieces later, and not much exp is wasted in the process).\n\nI actually still use Kaeya to this day since I just *like* him lol, and you could build a team around him too if you like.

If not, she's likely not the best option, and could be replaced with a sub DPS or a different buffer.\n\n**Cryo:** VERY good when it works, but also limited. Freeze is often countered by enemy lineups, this specific team is kinda AoE locked, and Mona's hydro application is pretty bad. Kokomi (on TTDS and tenacity) may be an upgrade for better freeze uptime, or Furina + Charlotte.\n\n**Pyro:** Hu Tao - XQ - Yelan - Zhongli and Hu Tao - Yelan/XQ - Furina - Xianyun are both upgrades imo, especially the latter. I really *like* VV vape Hu Tao with Thoma, but it's not her peak comp.\n\n**Anemo:** Looking good! You could replace Layla with Zhongli for his resistance shred and superior shield if you want, and def get Faruzan c6 if you don't have it.\n\n**Dendro:** Kazuha is almost 100% useless here. Replace him with any hydro unit, Rosaria, Fischl, or another dendro unit for better results. Sucrose would also be better since even if she can't always swirl she'll buff team EM. Yelan and Alhaitham are the most notable upgrades imo.\n\n**Hydro:** Solid! I'd say Kazuha + Zhongli (or Baizhu/Charlotte/some other healer) is likely an upgrade over Fischl + Jean, but your current team is already very strong.\n\nSo tldr: Sara cons, Faruzan cons, Zhongli, Yelan, Xianyun, and possibly Kokomi and Alhaitham are all potential upgrades.",

As long as you have Tighnari + Electro (Kuki or Lisa) then you can make a team from that can carry you all the way to AR 60. You just need to like his playstyle.",
            "Furina. She's one of the best suppourts in the game.",
            "1 - You at least have 3 good teams from your roster from your levelled characters - Sucrose or Kokomi electrocharge, Ningguang/Zhongli + 2 flexible slots, Nahida+Kuki hyperbloom. If I may say these teams are convenient for overworld because their damage is not burst dependent.\n\nMy suggestions are for building characters: Nahida and Kuki up to LVL90 to maximize their reaction damage. If you want to maximize Zhongli's shield also he can be levelled higher to 80 or 90. I think Zhongli can be not prioritized for now though to give way for the other characters.\n\nMore in depth character guides: this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRq-sQxkvdbvaJtQAGG6iVz2q2UN9FCKZ8Mkyis87QHFptcOU3ViLh0_PJyMxFSgwJZrd10kbYpQFl1/pubhtml#) and [KQM](https://keqingmains.com/)\n\nBtw Xiangling or Diluc + Xingqiu makes a vaporize team. Having Bennett in the team would be a damage upgrade so you can do this team better when you get him.\n\nNote: Be careful with Nahida's level material (fungal spores). Fungi drops have 2 options - 1 for character, 1 for weapon. Using pyro/electro characters to defeat fungi will give you weapon fungi drops. I suggest using teams without pyro/electro when you explore Sumeru to prevent getting the wrong drops.\n\n2 - Alhaitham and Furina are both good characters but they work differently. If you want a DPS, Alhaitham. I suggest doing his test run several times though because even if he is strong, his playstyle wants timing on his skill/burst/charge attack use to maximize damage. Furina is a great support because of her burst's damage buff. Using her usually means skill > burst > switch to teammates > repeat. She wants a team wide healer for her kit to be utilized.\n\nThough you said that you do not have primos. Wanting to pull will make you do quests fast for primos. I suggest weighing if you really want to get either of them enough to do that. Though you can also just try using the pulls you get as you play and see if you get an early 5\\*. If you do not necessarily like/want them now, skip. You can work on your current roster instead. If Furina will join the usual back-to-back archon rerun marathon, we might see her in the middle of Natlan patches again.\n\n(this got very long sorry \\^\\^;;)",
            "That's in part why she isn't considered that great a grouper. A large part of her grouping comes from inward stagger, which means you'll need to have first broken the enemy's poise. Sucrose's own skill poise damage is fine for lighter enemies like hilichurls, but larger enemies pose a problem. \n\nHistorically she's been put in taser teams since electrocharged steadily drains enemy poise and makes them more susceptible to her grouping. Other than that, not sure if there's an easy, short cd way to break enemy poise given how quickly the slimes spawn in. Perhaps supplementary crowd control or a taunt could suffice. Or slow playing the chamber so that you can wait for Sucrose's skill to come off cooldown between slime waves.",

The few instance I see where Hu Tao has a healer in the team is if Furina is with her.\n\nAside from the KQM link, I suggest searching for Hu Tao Spiral Abyss runs on Youtube. Even if you will not be doing Abyss yet, the videos can be helpful to watch for info on builds, teammates, and how to use them altogether.",

You usually want to Xingqiu EQ then Bennett EQ; however Xingqiu's orbital rainswords is very likely to wipe out Bennett's pyro before you can swirl it (Bennett yeets himself at the enemy when he bursts, putting them in contact with the rainswords). What I do is Bennett E, dash away, then Q and hopefully land somewhere a small distance away. Then immediately go to anemo to swirl.\n\n^(- There's a trick you can do with Lynette at C6, combined with Bennett C6. His pyro weapon infusion and her anemo weapon infusion mix to give you a free pyro swirl when you Lynette burst. Makes it a lot easier.)\n\n^(- Kazuha also has a trick where hold E will wipe Xingqiu's hydro and then plunge will swirl the self-pyro from Bennett.)",

One of them + traveler + Lynette + Barbara should be good.  \nYou can also run freeze with Kaeya + Layla + Lynette + Candace or Barbara, or maybe a melt team with Bennett.  \nNoelle + Gorou + geo traveler + Bennett is also a good option.\n\nYour strongest characters in general (who are worth investing in for the long run) are probably Bennett (great healer and buffer) and Layla (great shielder). Noelle, Sethos, Lisa, Kaeya, and Lynette are all pretty decent as well, but they show up less on endgame teams. Gorou is strong in his niche but *very* niche, so he's hard to evaluate tbh.",

She can provide hp% through hydro resonance and a hydro damage% bonus through her c2. Kazuha is there for resistance shredding and buffing.\n\nXiangling and Bennett meanwhile can abuse free vaporize reactions versus pyro enemies, and Sucrose can buff the team's EM to make those reactions even stronger!\n\nYour flex slot options for both teams are pretty similar tbh. Pyro, cryo, electro, geo, and dendro characters will all fit in fine without ruining reactions.  \nAny non-hydro, non-anemo character is fine for Neuvillette to trigger his passive. On the Xiangling team: Dehya can trigger *more* free vapes if she's built for damage, Lisa can add overload and EC, Kaeya can add some limited CC via freeze, Yaoyao and Collei can get you some free burgeons, and traveler + Ningguang can give you some added protection with crystalize shields.

The 4\\*s that run alongside them are *not* exclusive, but you\u2019re a LOT more likely to get them when they\u2019re featured.\n\nThere is a pity system, meaning after a certain number of wishes you\u2019re guaranteed to get either a 4\\* (10 wishes) or 5\\* (80-90 wishes IIRC, but it usually doesn\u2019t take that long).\n\nThere\u2019s also a 50/50 system, which means every time you get a character, there\u2019s a 50% chance it will be one of the featured characters. If you lose the 50/50, then you\u2019re guaranteed to win it the next time. That means if you roll a 5\\* but it\u2019s *not* the featured 5\\*, then the *next* 5\\* you get is guaranteed to be the featured 5\\*. The guarantee carries onto the next banner of the same type.

Also, crit rate is only valuable when you have Crit damage and vice versa, so in the early game where you can't get enough of both for it to be worth it, get the characters stat that they scale off of, for most it's ATK, but not for all. As for set vs stats, generally a 4pc set is a little more valuable than 1 mainstat, but you have 3 mainstats in a build, not to mention the substats.",

Your friend is correct as you most likely put on a set that doesn't increase the travelers damage. The characters who deal damage just wants damage. As others have said, theres a lot of information to learn and it can be a little complicated, the best way I can describe it is that you want to give each character as much of the stats that they want, and this will come with experience and research as its not completely obvious unless you've played games with similar mechanics in terms of stats.",

As for Furina, be ready to make decisions on who to pull based on the fact you have her, some characters lose value, and some gain value based on whether or not you have her on your acc, whereas Yelan just kinda fits in to already existing teams. As for getting Yelan AND Furina, I'd only do that later in your acc unless you have a clear plan on how you are going to use both of them and Xingqui. I will say, that until you get Nahida, Furina in the  Alhaitham team will be nerfed because one of the reasons she (barely) outshines Yelan is due to the split uptime rotation working better.",

Then there's Barbie and her burst heal even though her skill needs her on field to get the most use out of her heals.\n\nSo just have at least 1 healer and the rest can be whatever you want and you're good. Just make sure you put as much ER on your healers as possible so you can burst heals as necessary. \n\nAs for comps? Clorinde/Layla/Sara/Sucrose seems fun. Layla shield, Sara for buff, Sucrose for VV shred, and Clorinde to dps. Also got Heizo/Sucrose for swirl too if that's what you want to play. Just make sure you at least have one healer and add more as necessary, or use Layla if you want to play Clorinde.",

            "So she scales off of HP and all of her individual damage comes from her skill, so her ideal 4pc set would be 4pc golden troupe. Her skill has two forms, one which does damage to enemies but in return drains the whole teams health, and one that heals the on-field teammate. In most situations you always want to stay in the form that deals damage to enemies because she actually wants the life drain from the whole team.   \n  \nSo the way she works is her biggest upside is her ultimate where it provides a massive damage bonus buff to the entire team based on the amount of hp gained and lost during the duration of the ultimate. Every 1% hp gained or lost will give her 1 fanfare stack, and assuming lvl 10 talent on ultimate, each stack of fanfare will be converted to 0.25% damage bonus. She can have up to 300% fanfare stacks which converts to providing the whole team with 75% damage bonus. This amount is more than 1 goblet and a half worth of raw elemental damage. Because her ultimate is super important for providing the whole team a massive damage boost, you need to be on the lookout for ER and pay attention to your ER requirements, while there are guides about it, ultimately you should test the team and see if you need more or less ER as casting ultimate every rotation is very important. The stats she wants is hp%, ER%, crit rate and crit damage. \n\nShe is preferred in teams with good healing sources or healers, because you want to stay in her damage form of her skill, it will constantly drain your teams hp, so having a healer to off-set that is preferred, and it also helps provide fanfare stacks more quickly. Neuvilette is one of the better units as he can easily lose a bunch of hp AND heal it back within seconds. I assume you've experienced watching your neuvilette quickly losing half of his hp quickly then healing it back immediately to full within a few seconds, if we translate this to fanfare stacks, losing 50% hp then healing 50% hp will get you 100 fanfare stacks, which converts to 25% damage bonus at level 10 furina ultimate, and do this a few times and you'll easily hit the 75% damage bonus max very easily. Neuvilette also appreciates the damage bonus buff from her a lot as many elemental carries obviously do.",

            "1. Nope! Her CA is the only part of her kit that generates *energy*, but at c2+ she has two other ways of triggering her buff. Her c2 leaves behind a buff field just like her CA after she initially uses her skill, and even at c0 her burst buffs the whole team. If you give her enough ER that she doesn't need to use a CA, you can just use her burst and nothing else.\n\n2. See above, tldr yes!\n\n3. It's an *option*, but kind of niche. It also conflicts with her burst only playstyle, since you'll have to hit enemies with (I believe) her CA or c2 field for it to trigger at all. If you skill into burst, TotM will also already be running out by the time her burst is over and you switch to Raiden. I'd honestly just stick with 4p emblem or a 2p2p combo since idt it's worth farming tenacity, but if you *have* a tenacity set with high enough ER on hand it's an option.\n\n4. Raiden Lynette Sara Bennett should be fine! Kazuha is *better*, but the main point here is resistance shred, and any anemo unit can do that. Chevreuse can also provide resistance shred, but I'd prefer her with Xiangling instead of Sara since otherwise the team lacks off field pyro application and the res shred may have iffy uptime. Furina is also *great*, and I'd probably replace Sara with her if you want to use her (and keep Lynette since again resistance shred is really important).",
            "**For Xiao:**\n\nIf you get Furina, you should definitely spend some time prioritizing the Marechaussee Hunter + Golden Troupe domain.

Get Kazuha full elemental mastery viridescent pieces while strongboxing them for Jean, and at some point farm or strongbox a good 4p emblem set for Xiangling. Bennett will be usable with just a ton of ER, but eventually he wants to be on 4p Noblesse.

For your second team, I suppose you enjoy playing hutao, she is still a solid choice and you have some lv chars to go with her. Furina is best played with team-wide healers (baizhu, jean, charlotte, xianyu..), on-field healers(qiqi, noelle, kokomi) or fast healers like benny. She won't bring too much to the alhaitham team without baizhu, but you may change your hutao for something like xingqiu/yelan, furina, jean and ignore her passive (or try using diluc here).

            "yeah, I've felt the same way. The team as a whole feels more squishy with raiden, and I've had better experiences with Charlotte, so I think I'll stick with a Hyperfridge Clorinde team. I don't exactly want to cut back on Nahida's EM by changing her weapon to Prototype Amber for some additional heals. and yeah, Clorinde is hitting dendro cores in her Noght Vigil State",

Up to now Barbara (hold E) + Heizou were a pretty reliable combination for swirls but I know it can be better.\n\nProbably it will be triggering swirls on the side since I plan to replace Barbara.\n\nWill go with the Solar Pearl since I haven't got most of Alhaitam's team mates yet, thanks for the advice!",

            "Thank you!",
            "Yeah I guess that's fair, but I was saying the idea of the non crit dmg circlet because I don't think it's crazy to reach a 60 prob (+20 from passive) and 200 crit dmg without the crit dmg circlet. And maybe sacrificing not reaching to the 240 crit dmg in order to get more atk or em might be worth? You get me?",

These are my characters: [https://imgur.com/a/3FEpgVY](https://imgur.com/a/3FEpgVY)\n\nI like running hyperbloom in general, but I don't have many of the chars people say are best for any of these teams, which sometimes makes looking for guides a little frustrating. have Nahida and a flower from the deepwood set already equipped on her\n\nDo you have any advice on how I can improve my skill level in general? I feel like being so weak at AR 40 is preventing me from enjoying the game as much as I could be, but I don't think have a good enough understanding of the game mechanics or the in-game resources to fix that.",

I definitely enjoy pairing Neuv more with Zhongli in my experience so far, but I'm still building my Baizhu as I just obtained him in 4.6.\n\nHyperbloom vs Quickbloom, hmm. I need to improve with my efficiency with this games mechanics; however, I got Alhaitham during the time I was still grinding Artifacts so I believe mine is serviceable.  \nNoted either way though, I will see what works better for me.\n\nFingers crossed for **Furina**!",

And about DWM, cuz i cant see this debuff, can Alhaitam proc it with his skill or must Dendro MC to activate It?\n\nTy in advance for your time!",

Not sure if it's because I don't have yelan, but i assume it's a hands problem ahah.\n\nI kinda forgot about tighnari's aggravate team so that's an actual possibility aswell hmm\n\nMight end up just building dps raiden since I have engulfing and also navia for now, since I can at least pair them with xl/bennet and then xq or zhongli depending on which of the two I use. That shoukd give me some flexibility for now at least until I get some solid artifacts so I can then make other characters stronger aswell.\n\nAgain, really appreciate the help!",

Chances are I will put Furina with Raiden because raiden's team is currently weak. \n\nI tend to put xia ling, Nevillet and kuki in same team. Furina will fit perfectly with Bennett, Raiden, xingqiu. I think",
            "I want to pull for either Yelan or Furina, whom do you suggest?",
            "Don't suppose you could point me in the direction of whatever website does that?",

            "OHHHHH okay, omg thank you so much I finally understand!!! that's also why she would work with Xiao since he loses HP during his ult. So her ult is what makes her a really good support! would a good rotation or order be her ult, healer, then dps like xiao or neuvillette?",
            "Yeah I did it once , but after my second reroll I was about to uninstall this game\ud83e\udee0.. so ig rerolling is not for me",

Fischl is also just a great unit in general.",
            "Clorinde - Fischl - Sucrose - Yaoyao would be a decent team. Sucrose is also low investment. \n\nHope you get Jean soon!",
            "I could be wrong but I believe in c1 Hu Tao teams Bennett outperforms Xianyun and Jean,",
            "I mean you can make a cope hyperbloom team with Lisa Barbara DMC, but it won't feel good to play.",
            "Hard to say since there are so many options!\n\nIn general you could really use a good anemo support, since they\u2019re important on a lot of teams \u2014 Kazuha is probably the best for that, but may not rerun for a while. If you see the 4 star Sucrose on a banner she\u2019s great too.\n\nIf you like dendro, Nahida is *amazing*. Fischl and Kuki are 4 star electro characters who also show up on a ton of dendro teams and are worth grabbing.\n\nFurina (who has a banner this patch!) is a really strong buffer and off field damage dealer, and works great with healers like Jean so you\u2019d be able to make some good teams with her.\n\nImo you could also use a 5 star main DPS, but for *that* it\u2019s really up to you. There are a lot of strong options, and they\u2019re way more interchangeable than supports, so I recommend looking up some gameplay footage and seeing who looks fun to you.",
            "The \"lv80/90 is fine\" tip is still true for most characters!  \nIn general how important lv90 is goes like (from most to least important)...\n\n1. Characters who use bloom related reactions or swirl as their primary source of damage\n2. Electro and dendro damage dealers on quicken teams\n3. HP and Defense scaling characters\n4. Characters like Bennett and Sara whose kits scale with *base* stats\n5. Everyone else\n\nImo, for categories 1 and 2 it's p much *always* worth leveling them to 90. For categories 3 and 4 it's nice but not *vital*, so it's up to you and you can just do it for favorites of yours. For 5, don't bother.\n\nGood luck with the grind, and happy to help!!",
            "There's a few but Genshin optimizer is probably the easiest,  running it through simpact is more accurate, but unfortunately they are having issues implementing her."

Nahida was good and bad, most was cookie cutter that dragged but the time loop was very cool with a tease of trajedy. They finally did some tragedy with the abyss backstory interlude, although they took a bit too long to get there. Furina was a slow build up that finished really strong and gave a lot of sympathetic internality to the character, relative to genshin's normal work.  Only criticism is like most of genshin's work, it took too long to get there with a dull and bloated prison mini-arc, which proved inconsequential. But every time furina showed up throughout the main quest, even when she was more of an antagonist or just serving as more of a background player, she just stole the show.  It all did feel like a better Raiden story (hidden private archon, fake public archon twist) so they shouldn't go back to that well again even though the second time was significantly better.  \n\nGreat casting choice to grab lelouch's older brother VA and make him the good guy sovereign dragon.

It gave rise to shine for Kuki and Ayato, the latter in dire need of actual involvement.\n\nThe music event on the other hand, while not bad to be Itto-centric, didn't really feel like the other Inazuma characters contributed much to get a spotlight, Kujou Sara sidelined again while Yae Miko and even Ei showed up.",

            "Thank you TT these super long descriptions with tonnes of different aspects always throw my brain for a loop lol",
            "It's definitely very bad lmao. And, if you are pulling this for Yelan -- don't. She can only get 1 stack, which is a meager 12% HP. You're better off using an Energy weapon on Yelan anyways (unless C1 where you have an extra skill, which lowers energy requirements quite a bit). This weapon is absolute trash. I'd say 3rd worst, after Kok and Snek.",
            "Favonius on yelan is so good that they made one of the best weapons in game JUST for it to be occasionally better. You need really good Yelan build(s) to justify changing Fav for Aqua, which means croissant is borderline useless.",

            "yum",
            "Yeah, I just remembered Yelan \ud83d\ude2c my bad",
            "It is not... compared with other 5* stars is not rational but as the only 5* weapon, it really ie good eith this insane amount of hp.",
            "Ah right! Diona! I haven\u2019t used her in forever\n\nBut Favonius Bow or Sacrificial is probably a lot better than this Cupid Bow \ud83d\ude02",

            "HSR has entirely different system If we break it down. I think that it is a better model for both sides (though it's a bit more predatory with THAT amount of FOMO), but GI would need a whole game revamp if they would ever decide to introduce that. Not to mention, that content in GI is just bound to be more expensive to make, thus, HSR's model could just be less efficient here.\n\nAnd let's be real, they make dirty amount of money as it is. Changing anything with how it is, is just not what you do in business.",

            "C6 Furina with pipe.... lets gooo.. till mihoyo give her a decent weapon banner.",
            "That\u2019s how I got Baizhu\u2019s donut when I was wishing for Furina\u2019s weapon.",
            "Furina and Wanderer mains are gonna get shafted",
            "That's not what they meant. They meant that they want more signature weapons that work well on multiple characters, unlike Sigewinne's bow that only works on her.",
            "That's not at all what they meant.\n\nThey're quite explicitly asking for signature weapons that can also be very powerful on a good number of other characters.",
            "With the introduction of mono hydro with Furina, purple donut now has a team where it is (just barely) bis for Kokomi, which is one more team than Vortex Vanquisher, so I\u2019d put that over kok donut in top three shittiest weapons.",
            "A single HP% sands gives about 46% HP. This buddy alone grants 78% HP. You simply switch to ER sands that gives 52% ER to solve the energy problem and still have about 32% extra HP% by replacing HP sands. And yelan is mostly played with other hydro chracters like Xq and Furina so her Energy is not that much of an issue with ER sands.\n\nFav bow gives 10% extra ER over the sands while sacrificial bow gives 21% less ER but enables 2 skill uses. Replacing  fav bow by it will will mean you lose 10% ER and a passive while you gain 32% HP which imo is more than fair. The only 5* that can outmatch it are her signature weapon and elegy and both of these weapons get fights on who uses them.\n\nNo, i am not pulling it for yelan but those who are pulling for furina weapon may get it. And Ofcourse it is not her BiS nor the best 5*, but it may be better than most 4*. We still have to test them and see the results.",
            "It is not \" i am pulling for it\" but it is \" i got this by accident\".\n\nSo unlike the other HP weapons, this one can be used on a powerful character.",

            "You could probably do some stupid shenanigans with giving this to Diona and Finale to Ayaka to get all three stacks, but I doubt it'll be worth the buff.",
            "Same here I have 2 green donuts to go with a blue stick as a result because of that banner",
            "Now imagine if you main both of them \ud83d\udc40",
            "Vortex Vanquisher is weird cuz it's not best at anything, but it's a decent option for any on-field dps polearm + Shenhe. Even if it's outclassed by Primordial Jade Winged Spear, it's still a decent option for people who don't have PJWS.\n\nJust please don't go for it intentionally.",
            "The bar is on the floor. Literally. hahaha",
            "Just because vortex isn't someone's bis, doesn't means it's shit weapon, it's still a decent weapon for many characters, the donuts are just useless for most",
