Most of my library is 480p from DVDs and 1080p from Blu Ray. I've seen posts here with people saying they have hundreds (or more) of 4K movies. \n\nFor reference, I've got a relatively \"beginner\" library with about 400 movies. I doubt I'll ever be a thousands kind of guy, but I do appreciate high definition for what I've got.\n\nDo you buy them all on disc? I just flashed my drive to handle them, so that's not an issue anymore. The 4K discs seem somewhat rare though, and the cost adds up quickly...\n\nIs there some kind of legitimate web store without DRM? Or are people using \"alternate\" downloading sources?\n",

All housed in a 36-drive server chassis. \n\nDepending on how many drives you want, how much upgradability you want, budget, number of streams, etc., you might reach different conclusions. \n\nAn N100 has a decent bit of power these days, and with hardware transcoding, it should be able to handle several streams (quality dependent). However, I have seen some reports of them struggling with subtitle burning (YMMV). You will suffer from upgradability and flexibility. The N100 does not have many PCIe lanes to spare and is usually found in NUCs, which don't have space for many drives or other upgrades. \n\nA used Dell/HP/etc mini-PC connected to a storage array like a DAS or your NAS would give you a good bit more performance and can be found relatively cheaply. You will find some out there with 8th gen+ intel i3/i5/i7 T series processors which will run laps around an N100 in raw power. Transcoding, depending on the iGPU should be on par or better than an N100. However, you will suffer from the same issues of upgradability and flexibility down the road.\n\nIf you did a custom build with your own parts, you would gain more flexibility and features but cost a bit more in space, possibly money, and very likely power.\n\nIf you are like many of us and constantly adding more content and needing more disk space, it might be worthwhile to consider building your own setup to avoid future upgrade woes. But that is just my 2c.",

            "> I burn a lot more electricity\n\nIf you consider ~20 watts a lot I guess.\n\nModern CPU's are stupid power efficient.\n\nI have an i7-11700 & an i7-13700 with lots of RAM, multiple higher end NVMe's, 10Gb networking, and either lots of fan area (11th gen) or an AIO (13th gen) - they both idle around 35w.\n\nThe 11th gen can transcode 10+ 4k HDR ~35Mbps streams to 10Mbps 1080p and stay well under 100w.",
            "When hardware acceleration is being leveraged, the Dashboard session boxes will show (hw) for the video decode and encode sides of the transcode.\n\nLike this: [https://imgur.com/a/pms-dashboard-4k-transcode-with-hw-9q6kSM9](https://imgur.com/a/pms-dashboard-4k-transcode-with-hw-9q6kSM9)\n\nThere are scenarios where it shows up for only one or the other, which would mean only one of the two is being done in hardware acceleration and the other is being done in CPU in \"software\".",
            "Are you using the LAN port (direct connection) or wireless for your connection? Your issues could be around the bitrate of the file or speed of your connection to the Plex server. I assume the Plex server is on the same network as your TV here. \n\nWhat is the issue you are seeing? Is it video corruption, buffering? \n\nDo you see the same issues on other devices where you play back the same file? \n\nDo you see the same issues if you lower the quality to 1080p?",
            "I have no idea. It's literally the same file: 1 video track, 2 audio tracks, and the subtitles.\n\nNo idea why changing the audio track interfere with the subtitles.",
            "So switching h265( HEVC) to H264 might solve all my problems... worth a try for sure! Thanks!",
            "Mine idles ~30W. I suspect either an issue with Ubuntu Server and/Docker is keeping it from going lower. Maybe the 32GB RAM or 2TB NVMe? Not sure. Looking forward to upgrading to Ubuntu 24.04 to see if it improves things.",
            "Because it's causing subtitle burn-in when the audio needs to get transcoded. The server is painting the subtitles over the video frames to maintain sync with the audio.\n\nThis forces not only software transcoding instead of hardware-accelerated transcoding, I believe it also has a single-threaded choke point in there. It also causes tons of data to get shuffled back and forth across memory buses.\n\nWith 4k content, subtitle burn-in brings most CPU's to their absolute knees.",
            "Are there any other differences in the video portion of the file (Dolby Video, HDR, SDR, video bitrate).",
            "Not necessarily!  Keep in mind the container is being transcoded because of the incompatible DTS audio track and NOT because of the HEVC codec",
            "No, switching to HEVC would actually make the problem worse in this particular case. What\u2019s happening is that Plex is falling back to software encoding due to subtitle burn-in, so using a more processor intensive codec like HEVC will in this case not work well.\u00a0\n\nThe cheapest fix for this is to use a better media playback device.",
            "Ahh make sense. Well, I guess my issue is not power then, but prepare my files better",
            "No, but I just learned that because it's packaged as h265, plex cannot handle it for licensing reason, so it's forced to convert the video to h264.",
            "Well yeah, I have converted those files to add an AC3 track (that's why I was saying I had 2 audio tracks). I just got to figure out the proper standard to use to make Plex happy and ensure my entire library follows that standard.\n\n  \nOR, build a very powerful transcoding machine and have no issues for plex to transcode h265 to h264 in real time.\n\nOR change my LG OLED C1 to an LG OLED C3.\n\n  \nIf anything this post made me realize the problem was not so much the lack of power, but the format of what I am trying to view. For that I am very thankful, and it brought some clarity to my situation.",
            "I agree, but I think you missread what I said. ;)",
            "Yes. Plex will direct play HEVC, but only transcodes to AVC (H.264). \n\nI have a LG CX TV. I can normally playback 4K disc rips, but I do have issues with some higher bitrate files. I normally use a Shield Pro device and that will usually Direct Play everything. \n\nIt might be a better option to purchase a streamer versus the N100 PC. The Nvidia Shield Pro, Walmart Onn devices, Amazon 4K Max, and the Apple TV 4K devices are highly recommended on here. I've only had experience with the Shield Pro. I love the devices and they will play most everything. There is a slight red push on Dolby Vision videos, but it's not overly obvious to me. \n\nIf you have a lot of people outside of your home that you want to share with that would need to transcode 4K, the N100 would have better performance. Based on what you have said, I don't know that the N100 would fix the issues you are experiencing on the TV. You are already hardware transcoding and direct playing the files. \n\nIn saying all of this, I do have concerns that I don't have a Celeron J4025 to test. I also don't know if the other things the NAS is doing are causing the CPU to spike and causing issues with playback. Based on my experience with my CX and an N100, I usually don't have issues playing back files over wireless. I have seen a handful issues with high bitrate files showing as pixelated or garbled. This could be related to the file.",
            "You could also get a streaming box that handles Plex better than your TV\u2019s app, like a Shield Pro or an AppleTV."

        "content": "I'm so confused. I recently started using Plex. I have been trying to get local trailers to work (to appear with the clickable trailer button in each film's listing.) To do that, I have been using the Plex guides to add a \"-trailer.mp4\" file to specific folders.  Anyway, I have discovered some of the tv shows seem to have automatic trailers. Trailers I do not have locally. I also experimented with playing trailers before movies and it keeps playing automatic ones I don't have locally! But all the options and resources I find about this says those automatic trailer-sourcing features are for Plex Pass only? (which I don't have.) It's annoying as I only want to do my local stuff but it keeps automatically sourcing stuff which is supposed to be a Plex Pass only feature? But it's happening lol. Am I doing something wrong?",
