I recently discovered an incredibly simple yet effective hack for cleaning your microwave, and I just had to share it with you all.**What you'll need:**\n\n* 1 lemon\n* 1 cup of water\n* Microwave-safe bowl\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Cut the lemon in half and squeeze the juice into the bowl of water.\n2. Drop the lemon halves into the bowl as well.\n3. Place the bowl in the microwave and heat on high for 3-5 minutes. The water should boil and the microwave should be steamy.\n4. Let it sit for a couple of minutes to cool down slightly.\n5. Carefully remove the bowl and wipe down the inside of the microwave with a damp cloth or sponge. The steam will have loosened any food splatters and the lemon will leave a fresh scent.\n\nThis hack has made microwave cleaning so much easier for me.

            "It\u2019s a tampon string, built for the job.",
            "Thought this sub couldn\u2019t afford it \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
            "Yeah it seems really suspect to me as a method for getting a seriously stuck ring off. You're adding another layer of material the ring has to pass over when it's already too tight. Lubricant seems like a far less dangerous bet.",
            "The best life hack, wow. What else can you go to the fire station for, I wonder?",
            "The jewelry store where I got my rings told me to use windex. I complained about my medical condition giving me slightly swollen fingers and making it hard for me to take off my wedding bands and they said oh use windex- it helps slide it off and cleans the rings at the same time!",
            "Yup, work with jewelry, Windex works best period.",
            "Try using dental floss.",
            "Has he considered not putting the ring on again?",
            "Worst case, they cut your finger off and try to reattach it.\n\nThat's why rings made of steel are bad. There's a saw they can use that cuts off rings made of soft metal",
            "I mean... you do have a whole ten of them...",
            "Yeah, how the heck do you get the cotton thread under it in the first place?",
            "Are the silicone rings replicas of your actual rings?",
            "That's sales puffery that should never have been publicized.   \n\nSure, if you miss your hammer swing and hit the ring it'll shatter; but if you hit the end of the finger and break the bone the swelling will cause the ring to cut of circulation to the rest of the finger and ultimately lead to necrosis.   \n  \nIn the ambulance and ER we will not be swinging a hammer at the ring, and I've never heard anyone mention those \"special vise grips\" I see mentioned on the web. We will be trying a cutter, the string method, KY jelly, etc. \n\nWith tungsten being so hard, the steel ring cutters will fail against it, and while tungsten may have a low shear strength, it's a lot higher than the pressure swollen flesh will exert. \n\nI understand the myth, I used to believe it wholeheartedly, then I got into emergency medicine and saw what really happens.",
            "Usually, it's the knuckle that's the obstacle to get past, and while I have never used this string solution to get my wedding band off, you usually can just push one side of the ring against your finger and a small gap will appear on the other side that can be used to thread the smaller string through.  For me, that small gap is usually enough to get my band past my knuckle, but I also usually run my finger/hand under cool water to help the skin contract enough to let me slip my ring off.",
            "I thought maybe it was thin wire which would possibly be easier to get through than a flimsy thread \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
            "They weren't remotely asking what it was. They were asking how they passed it under the ring. \n\nBrush up on your reading comprehension, dude. Jesus.",
            "I was thinking the same thing when I saw that string. You can do this trick with dental floss, but it doesn\u2019t work all the time.",
            "We have special electric dremels with finger guards to cut steel/titanium rings off, tungsten rings you can shatter with mole grips, for soft metal (gold/silver etc.) rings my trauma shears have a ring cutter bit and you can just snip them off.",
            "Can't we melt the steel?",
            "Nah, just cheap ones we got on Amazon in the correct sizes",
            "My experience with injuries caused by rings comes mostly from machine shops, I think that's where your misunderstanding of my comment came from. I never said that the swelling is enough to crack the tungsten ring. My point was that if it comes to it, it's better when a tungsten ring gets stuck in a press or a million other machines rather than a steel ring. Not that a tungsten ring is somehow better than a silicone band.\n\nThat being said, even if it comes to swelling, a pin and a relatively soft hammer blow will shatter the ring long before an ambulance with ring cutters would even need to come. Hell, in an emergency, fuck the pin just hit the ring with a hammer in your other hand. It will crack easily.\n\nI trust you that there are freak accidents where that can't happen, but generally something ductile enough to be easily formed by a machine, but not ductile enough to be formed by a human seems like a much bigger no-go to put on your body.",
            "I see a bit of dental floss put through to pull the string.",
            "It\u2019s called a joke. Must be a real fun person to be around.",
            "> We have special electric dremels with finger guards to cut steel/titanium rings off\n\nThat's awesome! When I talked to a surgeon (probably more than a decade ago) he said they didn't have a way to remove steel rings. It's good to know that there are better options available",
            "Sure we can, but I do not think you would enjoy it.\n\nEver touched the hot bit of the oven? That was not melted yet so I assume melted steel is worse",
            "Um. *Ok?*",
            "Generally, yeah. \n\nAnd you're terrible at making jokes. \n\nThe setup and punchline aren't even there..\n\nIt's basically just - tampon string = funny. \n\nWhich it isn't. \n\nGood luck out there.",
            "Imagine making a low effort joke completely unrelated to the topic that basically equates to toilet humor and then telling everyone who doesn't think it's funny that they're no fun to be around. Pathetic.",
            "Not creative enough. A decade ago I cut off a steel ring off a dick with a Dremel I borrowed from Engineering. Dick water everywhere.",
            "Yeah man it\u2019s not looking so good. Thanks for  your help.",
            "Ah, take it easy on him. He tried. Seems like a nice polite person.",
