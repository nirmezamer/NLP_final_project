            "Everyone should be trained or by simply using and abusing software will anyone \"get\" the nuances sufficient to be a professional.\n\nI don't know how anyone edits without instant response to commands.  That's the reason I use AVID.   When I want to do something it responds in kind.  Effects or details be damned. Hell rendering be damned.\n\nI am editing. I have an intrinsic understanding of framerates and can pinpoint a frame where I want a cut in realtime.   Extend edit and move on.  It's such a chore to select, add edit and delete things out of the timeline when I just want them to do the thing I want them to which is roll the cut to the emotionally significant point I chose.\n\nFighting one fits all software wastes more of my time than the cool shit Premiere can do.\n\nAnd no. Don't tell me how to Premiere. It is inferior from a pure editing standpoint. I don't need to know all the other shit. I just want to edit without waiting for the program to take a half second to catch up.\n\nI should be able to make a trim and then playback as fast as I can hit L as if nothing ever happened. That is not true in Premiere by a long shot. I can't count because it's in the thousands of times I wanted to make a cut and review it quickly, iterate on it and review again. Such a damn chore to wait or play it 3 times so I can know that what I intended was correct.\n\nLike I said in a different thread. Editing in Premiere is like playing Megaman with latency.",

            "That\u2019s very apt. I edit long form content. And premiere has been a nightmare lately. Have been using Premiere since 2011 but the last few updates have broken the software. \n\nThe timeline shutters. \nThe playback shutters. \n\nIt\u2019s a mess.",
            "So you normally use AVID? Have you tried Resolve or FCPX?",
            "Omg! I'm not too fond of Premiere Pro and Adobe in general. Always outdated and behind. Effects and colors graded are way behind compared to Davincii's resolve. Not to mention that mobile editing is way behind compared to capcut, which Adobe illustrates is hard to compare with Procreate. Adobe Express is so bad and has much fewer template options and functions compared to Canvas. I wish colleges and universities would stop partnering with Adobe by teaching young students with Adobe outdated programs, so they students won\u2019t regret it like myself. Now I realize I can use other software and do it 10 times quicker and faster than adobe.",
            "you've literally put my feelings into words. it's getting to the point editing in premeire is like cooking an egg with a hair dryer. I hate that resolve auto scrolls the timeline to the playhead if you don't pause. i like to hear the film continue playing while editing. do you know if avid does this?",

            "Resolve is awesome. It's a fair bit slower to use than I can think and decide while cutting especially when everything I want is in the timeline assembly wise but sans pure editing (please for the love of god can we get a predictable extend edit), what it brings to the table is nothing short of amazing.  I've done whole projects with it but after consideration, I finish projects in Resolve now, add graphics and VFX there and if it needs further grading or editing, super easy transferring sequences around.\n\nFCPX -- it's its own beast. It's relatively easy for beginners. Packs mediocre features and is a chore to use at best 10% the speed of thought. You just have to drop out of your thought pattern, manipulate things so they are not going to break later and then continue on through the sequence.   It's like cutting in fits and starts like back when you had to actually stop and cut film, splice it together and then adjust. Same thing with Resolve cutting.\n\nContrasting both of them with Avid on purely editing. I don't need to go back and check to see if a cut works. I know it does. It might not work down the line and a second pass is necessary to tweak but I am confident in the choice I made because it already felt good and can run down a whole sequence roughing things out to a pretty close to polish on the first pass unless changes to the story arise.\n\nI am thankful using Avid and Resolve. Both high quality and high skill ceiling especially with Studio and Fusion. Stupidly powerful tools.\n\nYou'll most certainly re-visit the cut later and kill or rearrange whole scenes but you didn't have to analyze it over and over again to have made it good in the first place. If two scenes later don't work together, all it takes is that intuition and brain speed editing to make a client happy while they're in the room before it gets shipped back to graphics and final polish.\n\nPremiere is just another tool. It is what it is and I am forced to use it on occasion. I wouldn't build a workflow around it. Future AI stuff might come in handy.\n\nIf you are DIY on your own and don't need to git gud to Avid, Resolve 100%.",
            "Resolve is amazing. I only wish it was as fast as Avid to edit. I round trip edits seamlessly with Resolve. I can do an assembly in Resolve and then port the sequence to AVID. Do the hard work pacing, Making the emotions and characters stand out there. Then right back into Resolve to polish, make minor adjustment and Grade so intricately I've never used a piece of software which can do so much.",

            "Your video is about semantics. The TOS apparently use some words that people find intrusive but according to your explanation they are simply the words that are necessary to describe normal user directed functions.\n\n\nI think a lot of people hear a corporation say \"we don't do these bad things\" and interpret it as \"we say we don't do bad things but we probably do some bad things anyway.\" The people who write the TOS probably look more like Patrick Bateman than you!",
            "So prior to this TOU update, Adobe was doing all of this stuff anyway - creating copies on Cloud Server, allowing publication and sharing, compressing images to use as thumbnails, publishing on Behance, etc.\n\nThe license permission is - as far as I can tell - new to the TOU.\n\nAdobe was doing all of this without explicit user permission before. For years.\n\nWhat changed?",
            "I feel like a lot of damage control could have been avoided by releasing this video a week prior when people were canceling memberships (allegedly) across all forms of social media. \nI do appreciate a short video, that gets straight to the point that addresses the concerns of users, i did not utilize any software nor cancel my services during the limbo of TOS clarification. As something that is too good to be true, it probably is, this seemed too bad to be true, so although i had to kick the can on two projects, premier pro is the software i want to use, and im glad i held on. \n\nThanks again for the direct no bs clarification. Its what the people crave.",

            "The team has definitely seen the feedback around the label colors (and I've reported internally to extended teams). Did you trying using the 'default' label color preset? I know it's not quite the same, but it's close-ish. Not what you want, I know, but if you haven't given it a go, it'll at least put you back to similar <softer, muted> label colors unlike the really vibrant ones that are the new default. I'll keep you posted if I have more to share around that. Thanks SB.",
