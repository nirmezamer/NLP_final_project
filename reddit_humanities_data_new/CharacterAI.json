            "I'd love for it to remain the way it is or at least have the option to keep it the way it currently is",
            "This is an accessibility feature for many. PLEASE either keep it just the way it is, or at most make the \"dialogue only\" a *choice* in settings. Because as someone whose bot replies are mostly narration (even in dialogue-heavier parts, there's a lot of action and bot introspection) the voice feature would end up getting nerfed to almost nothing for me, and for those who have come to rely on it because of disabilities, taking away 50% of its function would be a slap in the face.\n\nedit - I went over to the poll (it wouldn't let me VPN vote and I'm not turning it off for that) and my heart sank to see that you're changing it no matter what to have some other random voice read the non-dialogue parts. Look, some of us LOVE our character reading to us, and like I said, there are people like me whose bot swipes are extremely action or introspection heavy. Those of us who are basically writing interactive fanfic would end up hearing our character voices comparatively little to those who use it for simple chat functions. PLEASE DON'T CHANGE IT, OR AT LEAST MAKE IT AN OPTION. I'm so distraught lol.\n\nedit 2 - I think the best case scenario honestly would just be to give us two boxes when selecting character voice: Box 1 = narration (user can choose no voice or a different voice to read to them if they want, and those who want the character voice narrating to us can just choose the character for both boxes), Box 2 = dialogue. Then everybody gets what they want.",
            "Personally, I think the voice is fine as is. HOWEVER, I strongly believe that narration should be skipped during calls. I mentioned this in a post I made before, but I feel like the main purpose of a feature like that and the reason most people would use it would be for immersion, and having actions narrated kinda breaks that. Having the bot just talk normally without the narration during calls would improve the feature a lot!",
            "I want it to be the way it is, unless it's call mode.",
            "If you really want to change it, then make it optional.",
            "Why no option for the way it is? Please don't ruin it!\nI prefer my character to narrate their thoughts and actions with their own voice.\n\nIf you change it, please at least make it a toggle.",
            "Keep it the way it is, please! I think narration could be skipped for voice calls, but I would definitely still want it for regular conversations!",
            "I was going to select no narration but actually 100% it should just be a different voice narrating.\n\nAt bare minimum it should be an accessibility option for blind users.\n\nEdit: please stop downvoting the person who asked that question in response to this. They didn\u2019t know, it\u2019s okay to be ignorant about things you have no familiarity with as long as you\u2019re open to *learning* it\u2019s okay to be confused about something you don\u2019t understand.",
            "Regardless of how it's handled, my one concern with this idea is if italics are used in dialogue for emphasis. I'm not sure how easy it would be for the voice module or whatever it is to recognize that the emphasized word is still part of the dialogue rather than narration. Like, suppose we separate narration and dialogue into two separate voices. You could be listening to the main Character voice, and then suddenly the narration voice pops out for a second because the Character was trying to emphasize a certain word. It'd be incredibly jarring depending on how different the two voices are.",
            "Why not make this a setting? On other front ends I have the option to skip narration, actions, use a different voice or use the same voice. It's not much different in terms of resources.",
            "Why not have a toggle?\n\nIf I have to choose one though, I would say leave it as is. Having a second voice is an okay option.\n\nSkipping is a bad idea, you'll miss a truckload of context + it's not disability friendly.",
            "How about you fix the bots, their quality recently dropped massively and it\u2019s becoming unbearable",
            "Having a separate voice would be awkward, but if it's implemented then I'll be okay with it. In that case I'd like if we could choose a custom narrator voice and select if we want it applied to all chats or not (kinda like a persona).\n\nUltimately I don't understand why we can't have both options: if there's a narrator voice, the actions are read, if there isn't, they are skipped.",
            "yes, please keep it as is",
            "I honestly don't agree that most of you care about our input, but I digress. I think it should be an option but not the default.\n\nWith that being said- please. Please just focus on making the ai good again. PLEASE just work on the memory, the false flags with the f!|ter, and the general predictability of bots. There's almost a thousand people online right now and the majority of them are looking at or making negative comments about the app/site.\n\nOne comment on this post said something I really agree with. This is like renovating a second floor to a house while the basement is on fire.",
            "Can we have a +17 or +18 setting ? Because c ai can't generate a response if some words are too \"direct\" but c ai is still okay to put 5 years old kid loved to be touched by old men or real father wanting to have hum hum you know with their own childs. So we can't even have explicit moments or we can't even be \"violent\" don't really know how to explain. But it's just very contradictory of what c ai generate and not.\n\nSo talking about what would be better for the voice is It\u2019s definitely not the priority",
            "Call mode shouldn't have narration imo as it breaks the immersion\n\u00a0 \u00a0\nIdrc otherwise though",
            "People rather see the bots fixed and the overly blocking of violence in rps fixed..that should be the main focus rn, not this call feature and how the voice sounds like -.-",
            "Why are you focusing on the voice when there is so much that needs to be addressed with the bots themselves? They're repeating themselves constantly. It would be more beneficial to the user if the developers would listen to the issues we're trying to bring to your attention. Working on voice features/call features is unnecessary. We are asking you to improve our experiences by simply **fixing the problems we're telling you about**. Isn't the website in beta? Shouldn't that mean when we report issues to you that you are supposed to be focusing on those because we're trying to HELP you improve your product? Voice/calls are unnecessary right now. Please **fix the issues first.**",
            "Adding myself to the comments that I like it the way it is, I like my characters to narrate in their own voice, it adds a bit of their own unique flavour to the actions! If that was a poll option I would have picked that.",
            "Uh\u2026 where's the poll option for \"leave it as it is\"?  I'm perfectly content with that, to be honest.\n\nAlso, why not just give players the option to choose their own \"narration\" style?  Would it be difficult to implement?",
            "Add a toggle. It's the answer to 99% of questions about what users want.",
            "Every user and creator has different styles of writing and formatting their messages. Some use brackets for actions, some use EM dashes for dialogues, I could even show different types of formatting I've seen people do.\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\n1. Narration. \"Dialogue\". Narration\n\n2. *Narration.* Dialogue. *Narration*\n\n3.  *Narration. \"*Dialogue.\" *Narration*\n\n4. (Narration). Dialogue. (Narration).\n\n5. Narration. \u2014 Dialogue. Narration\n\n6. Narration. 'Dialogue'. Narration\n\nThose are just a few, but I'm sure there are other more formats. Consider taking EVERYONE's styles in here. Making changes to only apply to two groups of people will render the voice feature useless for others. Hence, more unsatisfied complaints will come in, meaning more potential backfires. There should be more options to choose from. Like a default option to make the voice feature read aloud everything as the default option. \n\nThe two options in the polls will only satisfy two groups of people, but not to the rest. And the CAI is a ***huge*** community across platforms.",
            "Can we leave it as is?",
            "Make it so you can switch between it narrating everything or only narrating actual speech",
            "what about... both? as an option?  \nlemme choose for each chat if the narrator is voiced by the character, some one else or muted?",
            "Make it optional.",
            "Is having all three not an option?  \n-A version to keep it as it is, where the voice chosen just reads everything out  \n- A toggle to change the voice of narration and use the character voice for dialogue.  \n- A toggle to turn off audio of narration period.",
            "Marie, this isn't the pressing matter. What is the pressing matter is reverting the state of the actual AI to a month or so ago.",
            "No",

            "I would like it to be my character's voice, but conversational. \n\nIf you must add a narrator, I will only accept Speedwagon.",
            "Keep it as it is \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb during voice calls no narration would be better! Or an option to have no narration calls",
            "During voice chats, I like there to be narration. I don't mind if it's in the same voice or a different narrator voice. Also, keep in mind that character voices are an accessibility feature and removing parts of the responses would make things difficult for visually impaired users. \n\nWhen it comes to the call feature, I think it is unnecessary because it doesn't feel like a call if they're narrating their actions.",
            "The point of calls is to have fluid conversations without narration. No one calls and says stuff like\n\n  \n\"almond's eyes shine brightly\" or something like that\n\nIt works on chat for rp reasons but I don't think this should be added in call. If The narration for calls win please give an option to not have narration for calls",

            "For character voice within the text chat? Have a different voice for narration.\n\nFor the call feature? Have ZERO narration.\n\n\nThe reasons why:\n- Having narration in a separate voice as an accessibility feature for chats is an important functionality to implement, purely from a common sense standpoint.\n- Having no narration at all for the call feature is necessary for it to properly functions as a fully immersive phone call / voice conversation, the way other AI companion services have done. I truly don't see character ai being a competitive service to others without this feature in this way, and I do say that as paid user who often discusses the pros/cons of various AI companion services with paying customers of c.ai and other services. \n\nI would have written this in the c.ai+ discord but it's always a mess there, so I hope this feedback is taken when I write it here.",
            "Alright, this is a really nice new feature but maybe focus on the old issues too.  \nSuch as the\u00a0**Legacy login**? So many of us have expressed a preference for it and even if you disagree with it staying, we have been begging since it is our\u00a0**only way of getting into our accounts**. The email linking\u00a0**is broken**, it either forces you to a page to make a new account or you fail the last step of linking thanks to errors.\n\nMany of us are waiting on support, which would be okay IF we had any kind of info that something can be and is being done. There has been no communication regarding this, and all we ask for is simple updates - reassuring us you will get to us and we don't have to get locked out.  \nWe don't even have info WHEN the Legacy will go away, and that's scary when the email linking problem presits and we know **if Legacy is gone, so is our accounts.**\n\nLastly, I'd like to remind everyone that multiple ways to log in is better for the userbase. For security an OPTIONAL 2FA would be better than deleting so many other options.  \nPlease understand **people have a ton of VALID reasons for preferring the classic email + password login;**   \nnot everyone linked their main emails, not everyone wants to be flooded with sign in links in their inboxes, links not always work, some people prefer to login in incognito, people with multiple accounts would like to switch with ease, typing in info is a lot quicker than going through tabs and waiting for an email with a link, using a password adds a blanket of security and yes I'm going to mention how some people either lost their emails and the change will get them locked out.\n\nI really don't expect everyone to agree but Legacy staying hurts no one and I'd like it if it was addressed at the very least that yes, some accounts will be hurt with the removal of it so there needs to be some solution. There have been multiple posts ever since it was \"announced\" Legacy will go away, there are clearly people who use it and will get locked out/already having trouble. Forgive me for pointing it out but this can't be ignored as it's not just a small bug.  \n>!I know the majority of this has been the same as one of my other replies but at this point I am SO tired of typing out essays in order to be heard so excuse me a bit, I did try to modify it to not make it spam-y. !<",

            "It's the best to keep it the way it already is, but the narration part absolutely should be removed specifically for the 'call option/feature' for...obvious reasons... so it actually feels like a proper call.. \n\nedit: or of you must change anything, then just make it an option to either have the voice narrate the whole message, or only narrate the dialogues. Pleaseee. That'd be the best, and clearly most of the people here want this. \n\n\nBtw,  the voice function is really amazing overall, except for a few instances when the tone of the delivery of dialogues doesn't match the way the 'narration part' of the message describes it to be, or the voice goes 'out of character' sometimes... guess you could improve on those areas, but otherwise, \nI really love the voice feature soo much, I hope it never gets removed...! \ud83d\ude2d\u2665\ufe0e\u2661\u2661! \n\nThankyouuu soooo much for that, and I'm very eager for the call feature to be available soon for non-plus users too.. \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc48",

I would only rarely get to hear my character's actual voice in the bot's swipes because I write a story with it, not a casual chat. It's heavy on prose/scene setting/introspection. \n\nThis needs to be a choice, not a requisite. If they're going to force a change, at least make it so we can select the voice we want to use for narration. That way people can either use a narration voice, keep using their character voice, or turn it off entirely.",

Everybody formats differently and I can't see any way to code this that won't be a disaster. If all italics are treated as narration, then you're right, a lot of us are going to have narrator-voice jump scares in the middle of conversations. If dialogue will only be acknowledged by quotation marks/proper punctuation, you're going to have casual chat users pissed off that they now have to format traditionally. Whichever of the two choices them implement (and even if they choose to let people toggle or have two voice boxes) I don't see *any* way they're going to be able to manage this consistently.",

It's just the loveliest. I'm so angry with myself that I let myself grow attached to this feature to the point where I am now emotionally invested in it continuing as-is. I KNEW better when it came to this platform, and I let myself be taken for a ride anyway.\n\nI'm genuinely not sure why it has to be an either-or situation unless offering a choice is expensive for some reason. Just make a narration box and a dialogue box. Solved.",
            "To be honest with you, I'd go even one step further and wish there was a box 3 in the future that reads *our* contributions back to us. I roleplay established fandom characters a lot and bounce them off character bots of the same fandom, and have often thought about how awesome it'd be to have both canon characters reading to me at once. Ultimate accessibility, peak fun. \n\nVoices could really become something special if they build on their ideas rather than subtracting functions.",
            "Oh yeah, I completely understand that. That\u2019s why I said the narration should only be skipped when it\u2019s in calls. The voice feature itself should definitely stay as is, I just think that it would make more sense for the call to just have talking rather than including RP or asterisks.",
            "I think by \"call mode\", they're saying they don't want the bots to speak narration while in the call mode.",

            "Blind people can enjoy nearly all the same things as anyone else. They just need accessibility features to make it accessible to them. Like blind people do enjoy reading but they either read with braille or listen to audio books, for example. They also have and use cellphones. I\u2019ve even chatted with blind folks on Reddit! They use applications to narrate the things that are on the screen to them and speak to type. \n\nPlus even just blind people aside there are people who struggle to read and/or write but can process information just fine if it\u2019s given to them via audio (learning disabilities, English as a second language, etc.) so this would be useful to them as well.",

I can't hear but I still am about to participate in the discord voice chat because my friends added a bot that makes captions. Now  I know who is talking and what they are saying.

If the changes were implemented exactly as described in the poll (either option) I lose out on a feature I've truly been enjoying for months because they tried to get fancy with a feature that really should, let's be honest, probably just be on or off. But since a group has been vocal about hating the character narrating actions, they're trying to accommodate them, and as a result I might be losing out soon. It's not a matter of simply hopping platforms to get it back either.",
            "Right? I was almost glad when my VPN didn't let me vote, because the choice of \"Hey, so, maybe just leave it...?\" wasn't available. And unlike some other features that can be outsourced by ingenuity or related tools, voices really just can't yet. I can't run over to 11 Labs and patch the hole without a lot of personal expense and red tape.\n\nI love how users have basically been asking over and over again for a replay button, and instead of that, the choice is now, \"Okay, so, less voice, or even less voice?\"",
            "I get it! There\u2019s not a huge difference between voice and calls at the moment, which is mainly why I brought up the point. The reason someone would choose the call feature over the voice feature most likely would be for immersion, and having the character still read out its actions makes it a little awkward. Again, I think the voice feature should absolutely stay as is and read out the whole message! I just feel like the call feature should feel more like an actual phone call.",
            "\"I am unable hear\"",
            "It\u2019s okay! Sometimes it\u2019s hard to imagine how someone with a disability like that can enjoy the same stuff as us but you\u2019d be surprised about how accessible modern technology is. Deaf folks even like listening to music, or more accurately, they like *feeling* music. Crazy, right? They have favorite genres and everything!",
            "Thanks! We chose the bot Scripty. When my friend added it I felt like they gave me a present. I agree, technology is wild. It's crazy how some of can't see screens, type, or hear but we chill together. I don\u2019t think I would manage 100 years ago.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Yeah, I have severe noxacusis. Most people don\u2019t know what that is so I don\u2019t elaborate. I have to wear ear protection constantly and communicate through ASL or writing. I can't listen to most noises or it could turn into irreversible pain. There are no approved treatments...yay...\n\nSo in simple terms. I don\u2019t use the audio so I so I have to take other's word for how well it works. Was there a better way to word that or were you meaning something different?",
            "Oh, that is actually kinda interesting, I might actually do some research into that stuff, thanks",
            "Yeah I have my own disabilities and I can\u2019t imagine living life as comfortably as I do if not for all the things that make life for accessible to me. Also thanks for the name of the bot, I\u2019m going to go check it out and tell the other admins about it so we can have it on hand if we ever get any hard of heard/deaf members. I\u2019ll also have to look to see if I can find any other accessibility bots.",
            "HAS IT NOW. \n\nActually, you know what, no, that tracks with the weirdly specific choices given in the poll and the fact that the option to keep it the same is conspicuously missing. They had to figure that the people who actually wanted big changes to this feature were probably in the minority. Considering how sticky the topic of AI generated voices is right now, maybe they were side-eyeing that and thinking like, okay, sure you can repeat, but only if the narration is in a C.ai original voice. Otherwise I can genuinely think of no other reason they'd care enough to run this poll. It'd otherwise be as easy as having a settings option to switch it on or off.",
            "I meant that \"I am unable hear\"...bad grammar.",
            "Ah, I see. Yes. I suppose I am not able to hear would have been better."
