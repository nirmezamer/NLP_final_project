I never wanted to go back because it all just felt bad to me. \n\nI can't imagine being a child and an adult making you feel like you are going to drown in a regular pool, it's absolute helplessness.

            "\"Liz Lupus,\" who attempted to drown children and interrogated their mother about her origin and language, should be prosecuted at the federal level under 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 249 for hate crimes. Her actions go beyond attempted murder; they are driven by racial and ethnic hatred, making this a clear case for federal jurisdiction.   \n\n\n### Push for Federal Charges:\n- Advocate for prosecuting \"Liz Lupus\" under 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 249 for hate crimes to ensure the case remains at the federal level.  \n- This avoids potential state-level pardons, ensuring only the President can issue a pardon.  \n\n### Take Action:  \n- Contact Your Representatives: Urge them to support federal prosecution for hate crimes to prevent state-level interference.  \n- Sign and Share Petitions: Promote petitions advocating for federal charges.   \n- Raise Awareness: Use social media to advocate for federal involvement.  \n- Support Advocacy Groups: Donate to, or volunteer with organizations like the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), or the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) - all of which play pivotal roles in fighting hate crimes.   \n   \n\n\n\n### Focus on the Issue:\n- This case isn't just about a specific ethnicity or nationality. Attempting to murder children based on their country of origin is a hate crime, regardless of race or creed.\n- Advocating for justice in such cases helps ensure that hate-driven violence is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\n\n\n\n---\n&nbsp;  \n\n\n\nIANAL (well, just the armchiar internet kind) but if pardoned by Abbott:\n\nUnder 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 249 (Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act), hate crimes involving bodily injury or an attempt to kill carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Given the context of attempted murder with hate crime motivations, federal prosecutors could argue for severe penalties. Federal law allows for multiple charges arising from a single act, provided they fall under different statutes and elements. This means \"Liz Lupus\" could face additional charges beyond the hate crime offense without violating double jeopardy rules:\n\n1. Attempted Murder Charges:\n   - Attempted murder is a distinct offense from a hate crime, involving the intent to kill and actions towards that goal.\n   - Federal law allows charging for attempted murder under 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1113, with penalties of up to 20 years in prison, and more severe penalties if life-threatening injury occurs.\n\n2. Multiple Charges and Sentences:\n   - The separate sovereigns doctrine permits federal prosecution even if state charges have been filed for similar conduct, as they are considered separate offenses under different jurisdictions. Precedents exist for this in various civil rights cases; which includes cases where federal authorities stepped in following inadequate state-level charges or acquittals\u200b.\n   - Federal prosecutors can charge \"Liz Lupus\" with both hate crimes and attempted murder if her actions meet the elements of both offenses. This is not considered double jeopardy because each charge addresses different aspects of the crime: one for the intent to kill, and the other for the hate-based motivation behind the attack.\n\n3. Potential Sentences:\n   - If convicted of both hate crime and attempted murder, the sentences could be served consecutively, leading to a significantly longer prison time.\n   - The DOJ can seek to impose maximum penalties for each charge, reflecting the seriousness of the hate-motivated violent crime.",

That is the House.\n\nThe president is not in charge of who we have treaties with.  Those are voted on by Congress (years ago), then signed by the president (the one from years ago).\n\nThe president does not have the power to randomly forbid a company from selling their wares abroad.  He can't just, individually, wake up one day and say that Pepsi can't send soda over the border into Mexico (thereby forcing Pepsi to break a business contract).  And by Pepsi, I mean Boeing.  And by soda, I mean bombs.\n\nI wish things were different.\n\nI am physically ill over the plight of the Palestinians. \n\nBut please be aware that what you are saying is misinformed. \n\nIn the meantime, two things are true:\n\n&nbsp;\n1) Almost anything that Biden wants to work on must be done in secret.  He saw and learned as VP to Obama for 8 years that if Obama announced that he wanted to achieve XYZ, Republicans and all of their media would hysterically lament how XYZ would ruin the American Way.  Obama learned to keep his mouth shut until things were a done deal, and Biden had a front row seat to those lessons. \n\n&nbsp;\n2) Biden had secretly submitted a peace plan that focused on stopping the killing, withdrawal of Israeli Forces from Gaza, return of hostages, and a f*ckton of aid for Palestinian refugees.  Channels ran through 3 counties to offer the plan to Hamas.  \n\nHamas agreed to come to the table to discuss the plan.  They found most terms agreeable.\n\nNetanyahu rejected the plan.  \ud83d\ude20 \ud83d\ude21 \ud83d\ude20 \ud83d\ude21 \ud83d\ude20 \ud83d\ude21 \n\nEff Netanyahu!\n\nBut this also implies that Biden's terms were MUCH more favorable to the Palestinians than to Israel. \n\nTL;DR:  Biden has less power in this situation than you think.

I was half black and taught many prejudice beliefs (against my own self!) that I had to unlearn in early 20s. And I was actively experiencing bullying and discrimination for being 1 of 3 black people in school. And I still believed the narrative of \u2018racism is far in our past and is not an issue any longer\u2019 **while experiencing that racism almost daily!.**\n\nBut most white people are taught that if it isn\u2019t a lynching or the n-word, it\u2019s not racism so they don\u2019t recognize it as such. So when black people started getting all uppity and shit during the BLM protests m, they went \u2018nuh-uh! We don\u2019t execute them blacks anymore and let them lives their lives (faaarrrr away from our small white town), so how dare you call me racist! \n\nBlack people were raised by the kids that got spit on for going to school and beat up for using the wrong fountain. So they heard history differently. For example, my FIL is black and is 74/75. He was born in the late 40s. He remembers segregation, he remembers the Civil Rights movement, and he heard stories as a child from his great grandmother, who was a slave. \n\nBut the white people were raised by the people that used to spit on black kids, chased them out of restaurants, and their meemaws and papas? Yeah, some of them were an active part of the lynch mobs. So their version of history is very skewed to make them look better - and their kids, grandkids, and nieces and nephews got **that** version of their life. \n\nAnd so when black people started asking to be treated equal, white people don\u2019t want to accept that what they were taught is racist. They don\u2019t want to imagine that their grandparents and parents and uncles and aunts did outright participate in things that they can\u2019t even deny are racist. And so they blame the black people for causing problems because it\u2019s easier mentally and emotionally for them.\n\nThe racists - and their children and grandchildren that were raised and taught by them - were still around, just quieter because they knew the world had changed and they weren\u2019t allowed to act like that.

We'd have people screaming it's a scam to stop us using hairspray for some insane reason because they wouldn't be able to see the problem with their own eyes. I've even recently seen people use the ozone layer hole problem as evidence of a conspiracy theory because 'nothing bad happened in the end', totally ignoring the fact that's because we all pulled together to solve the problem. I fear that just wouldn't happen today. We've even got the hard of thinking denying we live on a globe, a fact we've known about for centuries!! I worry for our future generations."

            "So in case anybody isn\u2019t aware, FTM transition is not a concern for the vast majority of transphobia. Transphobia has very strong roots in misogyny in three particular ways.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s just establish the core of misogyny that is that women are inferior to men. Therefore, a man choosing to become a woman via transition is choosing to be inferior. This provokes cognitive dissonance in the misogynist mind. How could you ever want to become something that is inferior to a man?\n\nSecond, women have sex with men. If you become a woman, that means you are automatically gay because you are still a man and now you\u2019re having sex with men. And of course, being gay is like being a woman so we are right back to misogyny.\n\nThird, you might encounter a woman who you are sexually attracted to who turns out to be a man. Therefore, you were sexually attracted to a man, therefore, you are gay. \n\nNone of this applies to female to male transition because you are going from being the worst thing to being the best thing. And of course, regardless of the private parts involved, they now look like a man and so you are not attracted to them because you are not gay, so it doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\n\nEdit: to be clear, trans men do absolutely experience oppression and harassment, but statistically speaking, trans women are victimized at higher rates.\n\nEdit 2: you know what, I\u2019m just gonna say it. There\u2019s something highly ironic in people racing to comment on this to \u201cdefend\u201d trans men despite this comment literally being pointing out how trans women objectively, statistically have it worse. Literally. They\u2019re killed five times more than trans men. Five times more. And Black trans women are the single most murdered group per capita in the LGBTQ+ community. And at no point did I say anything remotely resembling the notion that trans men aren\u2019t also harassed and victimized, but that it is fundamentally different. So hey, kudos for looping in a twisted form of misogyny that crosses the cis/trans barrier, kudos to you for that accomplishment.",

            "Well, there is a biological component to this actually, it's in the the brain (also in the body with a lot of intersex trans people) which developed in a certain way, because Probably some hormonal imbalance which changed the brain sexual dimoprhic nature in the certain way. (The same reason why some people are gay and bi too). It's also something that's really random how much it effects certain individuals. Some people have low dysphoria and mainly want to achieve euphoria with their transition, while some have really high dysphoria, and for them, transition is more of survival instinct, then just search for happiness, in my case I'm feeling weird about my genitals since I can remember, feeling it as something alien and wrong, as a kid obviously i didn't understand that feeling, it was normal to me because that's what I've ever feeled in my body, beside I've kept haveing phantom feelings of parts I don't have, which also was really confusing as a small child. For me when I finally accepted myself after decades of putting so much energy, just running away and trying to keep myself from completely falling apart, the choice was easy, either this or no point of living, because all I've ever know was feeling discomfort and pain, if I can finally feel normalish in my own body then this is the only way currently. For some, it's not that harsh, but I've also have to say that no matter what, every trans experience is valid, but for some, biology is also big part of our transition, that's why we take hormones and have surgeries, to change the biology somewhat and hormones kinda do the heavy lifting, because all the sexual dimoprhisum in humans caused by hormone leves, that's why is important to help trans kids to, so they never have to through the wrong puberty which is a body horror to a lot of us and ruin their body beyond saving for some.",

It has been something that has depressed me something significantly. Unfortunately for some it isn't so easy to change or get the body they want.

And I hope you can continue to find comfort in your body. \n\nI'm just don't know what to help change the whole situation. The world is seemingly growing into a worse place to live. I'm in the UK, and the shocking rise in transphobia is sickening and I've seen soo many tiktoks and videos of transpoeple breaking their hearts because they've been denied this and that which could improve their lives.

Violent crime is at an all time low, even in large cities that Donald\u2019s friends at Fox News will tell their viewers every night are gang-infested wastelands. Inflation has been on a steady decline since I took office, after Donald oversaw trade wars with China, tax breaks that gave money to the wealthy and the corporations for stock buy backs, but we\u2019ve turned that ship and will continue to turn it around to bring down grocery prices for every American. And let\u2019s not forget those prices went so sky high because of a pandemic that killed a million of our citizens, while Donald told people it would just go away, and they didn\u2019t need masks or social distance or even a vaccine he himself took. And finally, the Biden \u2018crime family\u2019: Donald\u2019s friends in congress have tried repeatedly to find evidence of crimes I have committed, and they found nothing. So they went on the attack after my son. He is not perfect, none of us are, but I love and support him like a father ought to. But just remember. One of us up here is a convicted felon.

A win for Trump would be the opposite.\n\nBiden \"Won\" the first debate in 2020 simply by coming across as coherent and functional (thereby dispelling the \"Biden has dementia\" narrative) while Trump came across as unhinged.
