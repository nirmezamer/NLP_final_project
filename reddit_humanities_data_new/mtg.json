        "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nLet me introduce myself: I'm a new mod.\n\nAnyways, now that this is out of the way let's get to business. There was recently a call for moderator action. This got us thinking about what the community needs and wants. There are currently three principles that we follow:\n\n1. No violating Reddit's Terms of Service or sitewide rules\n2. No content that is not Magic-related\n3. Team has as little involvement as possible\\*\n\nThese three principles will stay. The sub will remain as open as possible. We can build on top of these. There are other subs that have stricter rules \\[enforcement\\] and if that is more your cup of tea we suggest you try those subs out, too!\n\nHowever! As mentioned before there was a call for more involvement from the team. This is where you come in: \n\n# What would you like to see the team do?\n\nGeneral discussion, concepts and guidelines, please. Keep real life examples to a minimum in order to avoid needlessly going on unrelated tangents. This post is\u00a0*not*\u00a0intended to be a political forum, rather, a brainstorming session.\n\nWe wish to retain the open atmosphere here, which means there won't be strict rules nor will there be strict rules enforcement. This doesn't mean we let the sub go haywire. This does, however, mean that the power is yours! Reddit's guidelines suggest that downvoting is intended as a tool to hide irrelevant information. It's widely used as a sign of disagreement but remember that if a post or a comment gets enough downvotes it gets hidden. Use this to your advantage.\n\nMost egregious cases that aren't caught by the extensive filters we have in place should still be obviously reported. On top of that you're also always welcome to approach us via modmail. (There's currently a bit of backlog so bear with us.)\n\nThank you for reading and looking forward to your opinions and ideas!",

            "All new mods should make a post about their nice new pulls from their most recent box opening to summon this subs resident spooky man and let him know you in fact did not draft the cards with friends. They're apparently dangerous, so be sure to bring a helmet.",
            "The vast majority of posters here want a certain user to stop posting their repetitive spam messages regarding limited play. \n\nIf those messages were the sum total of their contribution to the subreddit, I don\u2019t think we would have an issue. Unfortunately, their aggressive and hostile demeanor to honest correction, open debate, and constructive criticism is tantamount to harassment. \n\nThe moderators need to have a conversation with them about his contributions to this community. I would love for the user in question to share draft resources, deck building tips, and ways to play limited in threads that don\u2019t involve someone posting their play booster pulls and don\u2019t target specific individuals with judgment and insults. \n\nMy read from this post is that you\u2019re not planning on taking any action on this, however. You\u2019re not going to get much buy in from this community for your \u201cwe want to run an unmoderated subreddit\u201d approach, whatever supposed principles you use to justify it.",
            "Just out of curiosity, what separates this mod team from r/Freemagic\n\nThey are both low moderation subs, but they have very very distinct cultures. Is this just based on the users, or is there a different moderation philosophy. I\u2019ve always been curious about why this huge difference exists",
            "This sub doesnt have a purpose. There is already the Main sub, joke subs, card pull subs, subs for each format, proxy subs, custom card subs and rules subs.\n\nWithout rules and mods on this sub its descended into a pretty crap sub full of low effort posts and the same questions day in and day out most of which could be found with a 2 second google search.\n\nThe only thing this sub has is a better name and the drinking game I created",
            "I think it's funny that a whole new mod had to be brought to this sub just because the other two mods were too lazy to just ban a user causing problems.",
            "1. How about a sidebar, with maybe like *a rule at all of any kind whatsoever*. Some FAQs? Links to resources? \n\n2. Post flair and user flair. \n\n3. Daily/weekly posts for things like FAQs, rules questions, community engagement/creator spotlights.",
            "a major sidebar update would be helpful.",
            "It does seem that a lot of people offer their opinions or rather judgements about many questions. These can often be patronising, non-constructive, and may push people away from the mtg community in general.\n\nNew players should always be encouraged and helped in every way possible, and as new players, they may not know about the best ways to find rulings, interactions, card searches, etc.\n\nRemember, we were all new to the game at one point or another, and without patience and help from more experienced and knowledgeable players, we may not still love this crazy cardboard game.",
            "Remove any post for good pulls and put them in one long thread.\nSame with deck building advice and ruling questions.",
            "First order of buisness, I need a flair for being the coolest guy here all the time.",
            "I will get flak for this, but maybe keep EDH and commander post to a minimum. I'm a bit tired of everything being about that format, it's a bit tiring after a while",
            "Best suggestion would be to kill this worthless sub",
            "This is no longer an issue. :)",
            "Ya he went from annoying to unhinged very quickly",
            "This is not the case. This particular issue has been dealt with and actions have been taken.\n\nEDIT: I do want to be a little pedantic about this... We specifically avoided the word \"unmoderated\" because that is not where we want to go from this point onwards. We quite literally mean \"open atmosphere\" which is code for not having restrictive rules enforcement. There are other subs that already fill this purpose.",
            "That is a very difficult question. People probably find this sub first because it's big and has a more fitting name than r/magicTCG or r/freemagic. A lot of new people come here and then branch out to other subs is my theory. I do not know for certain.\n\nFor the sake of transparency I am also a mod for r/magicthecirclejerking which has a high level of rules enforcement and BracerCrane is a mod for r/freemagic which has a low level of rules enforcement. So there's overlap with other subs but I believe the biggest difference is how people discover this place first before other subs. BracerCrane has been here for a long time so the cultural difference cannot be tied to a person / mod.\n\nI've seen people being genuinely confused when they're being told that r/magicTCG is the \"main sub\" thinking that this is the main sub which goes to show that this could potentially be their first point of interaction on the Magic-related Reddit.\n\nIf my theory is correct it's good to have a newcomer-friendly entry point sub where you can ask all the questions you want. There is currently a slight problem with snarky and aggressive comments to very basic questions but I'm 100% certain we can figure something out.",
            "> Is this just based on the users, or is there a different moderation philosophy. I\u2019ve always been curious about why this huge difference exists\n\nKindred spirits like kindred spirits. People like to participate in communities that they can vibe with, and there's nothing that moderation (or the lack thereof) can really do about it. \n\nAnother point to make is that Freemagic also has historically been the designated \"protest subreddit\", which means that metareddit discussions (i.e. drama) and hot takes on hot button issues and culturally taboo discussion topics get talked there in volume. As a direct consequence, because Freemagic occupies the \"controversial topics go here\" space in the wider MTG community, other communities can remain relatively free of \"culture war\" topics. \n\nIdeologically speaking there is no difference between r/Freemagic and r/mtg to me. Free speech is an ideological maxim to me and I genuinely believe that free expression is a human right unparalleled in importance. The second personal motive why I joined the Freemagic moderation team when it was formed was to be a canary in the coalmines if moderator abuse starts to happen and I fully intend to do the same here.",
            "Okay, let's give it a purpose. The main sub is definitely a thing but their rules are much more restrictive than the ones here. Downsides include low effort content but also it's an opportunity for new Redditors and Magic players to start from somewhere.",
            "Both other mods have a decent number of mod actions (=housekeeping) and especially BracerCrane is taking care of a robust automod ruleset. I believe the issue as a whole is related to the massive growth this sub has experienced recently. This is why an additional mod was added to the team.\n\nI'd much rather look at this debacle as \"a whole new mod was introduced to ease the work load\" but I also understand your perspective.",
            "1. I will discuss this with the other mods!\n\n2. Post flair I'm pretty sure we will have some. User flairs I don't see a problem with either.\n\n3. Some of the most posted archetypes should be easy to do.\n\nGood suggestions overall! I'm personally all for these but as said I need to discuss these first.",
            "Sure. Contents?",
            "This makes sense and I agree.\n\nCould this for example mean selectively more mod actions in threads asking for help?\n\nEasy fixes: a post tag for \"help wanted\" which would trigger automod to leave a reminder message.\n\nOther ideas? (For everyone in general, not just you.)",
            "Put commander and edh posts in one thread too.",
            "What would even be left after that? Lol there would just be 3 threads",
            "that could be said for any post on this sub",
            "Unfortunately this is true both ways: everything is about that format because so many people play it. Unless we start enforcing strict guidelines it is incredibly hard to control what people post. I get your frustration, though.\n\nTwo solutions you can try by yourself for starters:\n\n1. Downvoting repetitive posts so that they get hidden.\n2. Visit another sub. I don't know what you're into but maybe r/magicTCG or r/MagicArena are more appropriate?",
            "Huh? What for? Kill it, then what?",
            "Who will I laugh at if this place is gone?",
            "Were they banned?",
            "But there are subs that do everything better than this one, so what's the point of this one? Answer there isn't one",
            "It's difficult to find a balance between discouraging low-effort posts that can be answered by googling and encouraging new players to come for support that they may not know how to find.\n\nA post tag and auto-response would be a great start- both to remind the poster of the common places to find answers, and to remind other posters to be kind and supportive of people looking to learn.",
            "Leaks, interesting wins/stories, discussions about the future of the game, community discussion, ect.",
            "One person sees a cool post format, they post a thingy with that fad. Many other subs have very strict guidelines in place to prevent this. The downside, of course, is that you can't post about everything related to Magic.",
            "Not really a public matter, but I mean I guess you can tell that they're not here, so... Yeah.\n\nI've yet to have a full conversation with them but that's one of the next things on my list. Also this ban wasn't issued by me, just to be clear.",
            "What do you want us to do? I'm serious about this. We really want to see this sub flourish. What kind of a sub would you like to be a part of?",
            "You know what this sub doesn't have? A goddamn thread for every single leaked card every time a new set comes out that floods my front page. It's literally how I discovered this sub, because I couldn't deal with the main sub anymore during every spoiler season.",
            "God please no individual threads for leaks, that's literally what sent me here from the main sub",
