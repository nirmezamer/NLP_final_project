            "Just offering my perspective as an Indigenous person: \n\nMany people are not aware of the history of the land they inhabit. There are many reasons for this that I won\u2019t get into here. \n\nLand acknowledgments are a step in the right direction towards acknowledging this history. They are an imperfect tool, as they often carry a sense of \u2018waving of the hand\u2019 to them and are, at times, incorrect in their information. \n\nI went to a tribal college. We had land acknowledgments. It was very simple as only one tribe had inhabited the land the college was on. There were a variety of perspectives on having one, but we wanted it, and fought for it. It was easier at a tribal college, as you can imagine, but it was still a fight. \n\nA few years ago, my former partner did an REU at a very influential and progressive biological research lab. They were very proud of the history of their location as an abandoned mining town that the intrepid settlers had bravely secured in the wilderness. \n\nThis was, of course, incorrect. The land they were on was inhabited by the Ute prior to settlers encroachment and forced relocation. My former partner procured the documentation for this and was met with a great deal of resistance. Now, they have a land acknowledgment (for whatever that\u2019s worth to you). \n\nI now work at a large public research university in the United States that is on land that was inhabited, in part, to my people. The public education in the state I am in is extremely misleading (this is intentional) regarding the nature of our forced removal. Few students and faculty are even aware that the history of this university includes bloody battles between settlers and the Indigenous peoples who lived here. \n\nI am one of three Indigenous faculty enrolled in federally recognized tribes here (the federal recognition is important). Late last year, I met with one of my fellow Indigenous folk for coffee. He is the former head of the anthropology department and also belongs to a tribe originally from the area where we now work. This university did not have a land acknowledgment, but after years of resistance, wanted to get with the times. \n\nHe told me he had been invited to the meeting to discuss it. He thought they wanted his help crafting it and was a little bit excited. We both had our reservations, but we were intrigued that it was happening. \n\nI met with him after that meeting. They only wanted him to verify that they were citing the correct treaties. The land acknowledgment itself was crafted by a team of non-Indigenous people. It was disappointing for both of us, but hey, at least they had a land acknowledgment now. \n\nSo I think you are, in some ways, correct. There are limitations and problems with these land acknowledgments, and who they\u2019re actually serving. \n\nEven so, from my own experiences and those of my peers, know that each time you hear one, it was fought for. That matters.",
            "I'm from Australia, and the indigenous beliefs and customs are going to be different from where you're from in Canada.\n\nAs others have pointed out, Indigenous people aren't a monolith. Australia, Canada, and the US are all comparable in size to Europe. Just as we don't expect a Portuguese person to have the same language and culture as a Lithuanian person, neither should we expect a person from Wajuk country to be the same as someone from Yuggera. Same goes in Canada: Gitxaala lands are a continent away from the Mi'kma'ki.\n\nThat's a very long way of saying: we're talking in very broad generalisations here. Things that are true of one indigenous group aren't necessarily true of another, and that's before we even get to individual differences between persons within that group.\n\nWith that in mind, there is a tendency across many of the indigenous cultures I've interacted with to have a religious connection to the land itself. \n\nLand acknowledgements are culturally important to people to whom land is religiously important. Just because something isn't important or offensive to you doesn't make it insignificant to someone else.\n\nIn Anglo-Western culture, we have certain rituals around death and burial. You may, understandably find it offensive if a person urinated on the gravestone of a loved one of yours. Anyone, regardless of if they participate in our culture, and bury their dead, marked with a stone or not, should understand that this is an offensive behaviour. You can understand why it would be offensive to spit on the holy book of another religion.\n\nThis doesn't mean we need to live our lives by the religious standards of others. I'm not a Christian, but I'll refrain from blasphemy while in a church for a wedding. I'm not going out of my way to be a jerk on purpose. I'm not going to bring pork to a mosque.\n\nWith that kind of cultural understanding in mind, consider that for some indigenous groups, the land itself *is* religious in the way that a church is religious. Taking two minutes to pay lip service to the cultural and religious heritage to a historically disinfranchised people isn't harming anyone. At worst, it's doing nothing. At best, it actually makes some people feel respected.\n\nI say lip service, because, so often these Acknowledgements Of Country feel insincere. Running through a script because it's become the accepted norm. A matter of procedure. Even this - a white politician trying to rush through a 15 second acknowledgement so as to seem like he actually cares, but really doesn't - isn't a bad thing. It shifts the Overton Window, just slightly. It keeps the ideas of Indigenous lands and their issues relevant in people's minds, even if just a little.\n\nIt's not a magic wand that will go and magically fix all of the generational trauma inflicted upon the Aboriginal peoples of our countries. Telling a room full of white people that you acknowledge the land will not do much to address issues affecting the people being addressed, who often aren't even in the room. That doesn't make it pointless. It's still an ongoing reminder of past, present and future.\n\nThe indigenous people of my country face many problems. There are no simple solutions. These problems aren't going to just go away. Acknowledgments of country are for now, one tiny piece in a much larger puzzle as to how to heal some deep intergenerational wounds.",

            "The reasons these land acknowledgements exist is because some natives wanted and asked for it. Natives disagree with each other, sure. It doesn't mean rich white or Asian people are telling everyone else what natives want.",

            "I see the benefit in that it is a response to 5-6 generations of indigenous erasure.\n\nWe also have a ton of immigration to north America who don't understand the context of how treaties were made, then broken.  They need to know so that they have an understanding as to the how and why indigenous communities still face so many challenges.\n\nI do agree with you in that these acknowledgments often feel like they are some sort of \"least amount of effort\" to show that we are a progressive society... We need more substantive change.",

            "Where do you live?\n\nIn Australia, the act of Welcoming to Country was and is a traditional way of declaring peace when people from one nation visit the land of another nation. It says \u201cWe, the caretakers of this land, invite you to be here and we trust that you won\u2019t seek to harm us or the land that sustains us\u201d. \n\nA Welcome can only be given by an individual of the nation who traditionally lived on the Country where the event takes place. They usually take the form of a short speech about the history of that place and the individual\u2019s family/nation. Sometimes there will be a smoking ceremony, which symbolically cleanses the area of bad spirits. \n\nFor large or official events, it is quite a powerful gesture of reconciliation to have that event sanctioned and blessed by someone with an unbroken connection to that Country going back tens of thousands of years. It reminds audiences that trust goes two ways and that non-Indigenous Australians have a duty to act with respect towards the land and its traditional people, and do what is within their capacity to work towards reconciliation. \n\nHere\u2019s a [video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZleZy8N0EFE&pp=ygUSd2VsY29tZSB0byBjb3VudHJ5) of a Welcome to Bundjalung Country (North-Eastern NSW).",

It\u2019s like when some fringe interest claims each black family should be entitled to $300 million each and then everyone just argues over it. \n\nExtreme demands and claims are designed to maintain the status quo because these things will never happen and it just enraged people on every side.",

But most do support them. \n\nBut a lot of places use them because they are easy. They don't do real work on the others, many of which are far more important. \n\nThe reason for them is that a lot of people don't realize in particular how Canada gained these lands. It is usually visualized vaguely or some variation of Terra Nullis where therr weren't people living in the areas where we have modern cities. The history of how modern a lot of treaties are isn't well understood either.",
            "I find the plethora of these posts like \"CMV: gestures toward social justice are uniformly hollow and disingenuous\" perplexing. Obviously a groundswell of social change reversing centuries of injustice would be great, but it's not always possible to do in a quick and thorough way, and a verbal gesture is what can be done quickly. I'm sure that some are actually cynical PR stunts, but many are doing the thing that can be done right now when massive change can't.\n\nI mean, I had a friend complain about his boss recently, and, instead of going to his workplace and planting meth in his boss's office so he'd be fired and my friend's work situation would improve, I just said, \"that sucks, I'm really sorry to hear it.\" By your standards, I was being stupid, and maybe even offensive, but he didn't seem too upset.",

I am not here to say that land acknowledgments are good or bad but I think it's important to remember that native people are not a monolith on their opinion on the topic. \n\n> \"we hereby acknowledge that younger generations have no way to get a house thanks to us but we aren't changing anything and the pyramid scheme will continue\",\n\nI mean, I *would* appreciate if boomers acknowledged that we cant get a house because of them. Many refuse to do so. Would it be a fix to the actual problem? Of course not. But it could be the start of a conversation.",
            "I'm going through to be a teacher in Ontario. I am not in any way indigenous, but I have been responsible for crafting and giving several land acknowledgements during the program. We have been trained to make these acknowledgements meaningful when they can so often fall into something that is done routinely, without meaning. The land acknowledgements that we have been giving are more than just a paragraph of text to read. We start with that for certain, but during or after that we try shine a light on an aspect of current or past indigenous culture/history. For example, I gave one earlier this week and as you know, Friday was National Indigenous Peoples Day in Canada. For this acknowledgement we focused on the celebrations and festivals that were going on for that day. We pointed our students towards pow-wows, markets, and festivals across the province, but obviously focused on the GTA where we were. In other land acknowledgements we have highlighted actions students could take to stand behind Indigenous groups as allies, or learn more about indigenous history. For example, we pointed them towards documentaries, highlighted news articles that may have been missed, and highlighted Indigenous activists to follow or donate to. The major way that we are working to make them meaningful is to attach action to them, so acknowledgements are not just empty words. \n\nFrom what I have seen, the land acknowledgements in my in-school placements have been totally disappointing. They are short and insincere. This is something that many of those in my cohort are determined to change. I am graduating as a history teacher, as are many of my friends, so we have the expertise and ability to make it happen. My overall point here can be summed up in the idea: \"Don't let the perfect, be the enemy of the good\". Land Acknowledgements aren't perfect, but they're an improvement. They aren't there yet everywhere, but they can be done right, and they can be done well. \n\nI'd love to hear what you think about this take on the land acknowledgement.",

Gives the same energy as having one POC character in an entire move.\n\nOn the other hand, I think some Native Americans want it because for so long a lot of people wouldn't acknowledge that they land we live on belonged to Native Americans.",

This allows for learning about the land but also infuses a lot of meaning and uniqueness into every land acknowledgement in your organization.\u00a0\n\n\nIn this case it is not a reminder but a learning experience and sharing amongst the group so as to understand historic injustice.

            "Part of what pisses me off about land acknowledgements is your last statement - they were fought for. It gives me an actual wtf. People had to fight tooth and nail for THIS? This garbage virtue signaling, minimal effort, abhorrently inaccurate brushing off of the real history of this nation?\n\nMy university is infuriatingly... shallow with out acknowledgements. \n\nFor example, once a year, they raise the flag of the tribe that the land belonged too before US encroachment. They do it right next to the US flag, and have a tribal leader speak for the cameras. And after the cameras are turned off and they get the PR statement, the flag comes down. And it stays down for a year. It isn't even left up lower than the US flag or sooooomething. Anything. It's literally just an annual PR stunt that lasts an hour at most.\n\nAnd then the actual acknowledgements. I hesitate to give the details as I don't want to dox myself, but my university is in the Algonquian region. Many tribes who lived in my area were forced to migrate here due to Iroquois movement West into their native lands - a migration caused by European settlement in the East. So they were forced into harsher lands and found a new subsistence after massive suffering, a subsistence that relied both on  the land and tapping into French desires for partners in the fur trade. And they maintained that subsistence for multiple generations, hundreds of years, and then they once again were forced off their land by encroachment from the East.\n\nIt's a fucked up story, and our acknowledgement doesn't even consider it. It just says \"these lands have been the home of this tribe since time immemorial.\" Wtfman, no it hasn't. The suffering of this tribe is way deeper and far more profound than that. But that takes thoughtfulness and education. They don't want that. They want a 10 second sound bite to signal how virtuous they are and then to move on.\n\nAnd people had to fight for THAT? it's disgusting, man.",

But I am going to share my perspective and see what you think.\n\n\nI am a scottish/European mutt who was born a third generation immigrant to Canada. My ancestors were displaced innumerable times. I have no great claim to ancestral land.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd you know what? That doesn't matter to me. It absolutely could - I could make myself care about it, do research, fight about it, etc. But I don't have a cultural narrative driving me in that direction, and I don't want one. I'm Canadian now. I was born here. And, you know, I might not always be one. I've got plenty of cause to leave.\u00a0\n\n\nI am where I live, and my people are the people of my community. I don't need to be part of a storied lineage or the rightful owner of a contested land. Those narratives/perspectives create conflict with people I have no real conflict with. I don't want to fight about whose land this is because our ancestors fought over it (though mine did not). I want to start clean, say this is land we were both born on, and move forward united.\u00a0\n\n\nThe tragedies of the past can never be truly righted. Acknowledging them can open old wounds and create ill feelings between two groups where neither side was directly involved with the tragedy.\u00a0\n\n\nI accept that I was born into a world with no ancestry or holdings to my name, partly due to conquerors of the past. I work to make the best of what I can in a world that doesn't owe me anything. I hope I can contribute to a community of multiple cultures that embrace each other as if we were all part of the same cultural group. But every time we focus on our differences, or seek entitlements based on our differences (even if they could be justified), it seeds division and resentment.\u00a0\n\n\nI envision a future where we are not a society made up of indigenous people, Africans, Indians, whites, etc. But where we are all just human individuals who respect each other and want the best for each other. I know that's idealistic, and there's a taboo inherent to it because it will likely lead to the dilution of separate cultures.

Unfortunately, I think I'd still conclude that for the most part, these acknowledgements are essentially virtue signaling to *tell* outsiders that they care about the land history when they really don't. When your colleague wasn't used as a resource to craft the acknowledgement despite his integral ties, it says all it needs to, to me. \n\nI never learned much of the atrocities committed by the settlers as they expanded across North America in school. Most of my learning has happened in more recent times as brave members of your community and others like yours continue to speak out, and then I follow up on the stories. This started to happen about the same time I've begun to expand my professional career. Much of this expansion includes going to events, golf tournaments, seminars, etc. Most of these are preceded by a land acknowledgement, but I can't really help but hear \"Na na, na na naaa!\" In every one of them. \n\nIt's clear that the acknowledgement doesn't say that the tribes have been consulted in modern times, to help them deal with the loss of the land. It doesn't say the referenced treaty was amended to include protections or compensation this time around. All the acknowledgements do is say, as you said, acknowledge the treaties that \"gave\" the land away in the first place. \n\nI feel this is disingenuous to the intent. If the treaty was signed due to coercion, or under threat of bloody genocide, then the treaty should be void. Why are we still referencing them?? If we wanted to make amends for what's happened in the past, include in the acknowledgement some sort of affirmative action that the land owner is doing to make the land acquisition slightly less painful. \n\nIn my white person biased experience, I haven't heard a single acknowledgement that tells me the people reading the passage actually care about making it better.

            "I'm quite ignorant about both, to be honest. I know a little of Australia, between general education, friends, and some light reading. I know far less of Canada. Though I understand there are some superficial similarities in certain areas - I might be wrong, but I think some Canadian indigenous groups have beliefs about the Land, in a vaguely similar way some Australian groups talk about Country.\n\nAs a certified non-expert, here are a few things I'm reasonably confident in knowing:\n\nThe word \"aborigine\" is considered offensive in Australia. It's recommended you don't use it. There's nothing intrinsically offensive about it, it's just got a lot of historical baggage. Kind of like \"retard\" is a valid word without being *intrinsically* offensive (the water was used to retard the fire), but it's no longer considered acceptable to throw as an adjective for people. \"He is retarded\" is considered offensive. It's cultural baggage, but you probably shouldn't use \"aborigine\" in an Australian context. \"Aboriginal\", \"Indigenous\", or even \"First Nations\" are entirely acceptable here.\n\nTribe is not used much. \"Mob\" is much preferred. \"How does your mob do it?\"\n\nThose are more \"how does white Australia interact with Aboriginal Australia\" facts. The following are more regionally specific.\n\nThere are actually to different groups of first nations people in Australian territories.\n\nIt's often \"Aboriginal *and* Torres Strait Islanders\", who are considered to be culturally distinct. So even though the indigenous peoples of Perth and Sydney (a whole continent apart) are both considered Aboriginal, the Torres Strait lies between the very north of Queensland, and the island of Papua (shared between Indonesia, and the nation of Papua New Guinea).\n\nI'm even more ignorant about Torres Strait folks than I am Aboriginal Australians. It's my understanding that genetically, linguistically, culturally, etc; they're far more similar to their northern neighbours in Papua than their southern mainland Aboriginal neighbours.\n\nMany Aboriginal cultures have rituals around death that are unfortunately incompatible with the Western culture brought by the Europeans when they came to colonise. This isn't me saying these rituals are bad or wrong in any way, just that they have some core incompatibilites. A devoted Muslim can simply just not eat pork, and skill live their life among neighbours who do. It's not a problem.\n\nSorry Business, for some groups involves not saying the name of the deceased for *years* after their death. The belief is that by saying their name, you'll call them back from their trip to the afterlife. Effectively, stranding them in purgatory. It's serious business if that's your religion - you would sincerely believe that you were harming the soul of your departed loved one.\n\nThe problem is that intent does not matter. If you lived in the central Australian city of Alice Springs, and your sister named Alice died, you cannot say the name of the city you live in for several years.\n\nPresumably, pre-colonisation, this cultural practice did not create problems. For an Aboriginal person living in both worlds - one foot in their ancestral culture, and another foot in modern white Australia - working a job, paying taxes, etc; this creates a serious conflict. How can you work certain jobs if you cannot say certain names at all?\n\nAgain, not a value judgement of this particular death ritual, it is just unfortunate that it's incompatible with the culture brought by the Europeans. It's one of many examples faced by Aboriginal people who don't want to abandon their heritage. I don't know what the answer is, but I'm glad I'm not the one being forced to choose.",

The words can and will change whenever the government (democrats vs Republicans change). To me, it\u2019s a distraction to fight for small acknowledgement. Instead I would fight for larger things that directly improve people\u2019s lives.\n\nThere is a concept called \u201cdouble speak\u201d where people appear to advocate for an issue while in fact doing nothing to actually improve things. An example would be the \u201csingle arms shipment\u201d Biden delayed to Israel to protest their war actions.

Are you really shocked that that hasn't happened? Is it rank hypocrisy that the US and Canada haven't ceded whole states or provinces back to native populations despite a poetry reading's very earnest land acknowledgement?\n\nIt's true that most people aren't really contemplating returning land, because most people don't have any significant amount of land to return, and the powers that be didn't become the powers that be by ceding their wealth. \n\nI think the reason this gets branded as hypocrisy is because the whole spectrum of liberal-coded institutions are treated as a monolith, and thus the disconnect between what some people say on twitter and what massive governmental organizations do shows that the whole enterprise is false and cynical, instead of being, you know, millions of different people thinking, saying, and doing different things.",

I really only learned the history behind colonization when I went off to university to pursue a history degree. School had touched on it, but there was nowhere near the focus it deserved. It's something that I hope the next cohort of educators can correct. \n\nAnother reason these actions are important is because it is important to not simply treating indigenous people as past people. People who were wiped out, or only exist in the fringe of society. We need to know that indigenous people are victims of colonization, but we also need to acknowledge that they are so much more.

I assume you don't think that raping your enemies is ok, or wonton murder of those below your social hierarchy is fine. You likely don't have raist ideologies about human brain sizes, capacity for reason, humanity based on skin color.

            "My experiences in real life differ drastically than those online.  \n  \n**Real life:**   \nSay it's a social gathering, someone gets offered food, vegetarian says , \"No thanks, I'm vegan/vegetarian\" in much the same way someone with a food allergy would say \"No thanks, I'm allergic to \\_\\_\\_\\_.\" They may get some questions why, but I've never had anyone try to counsel me on why I, personally, should or shouldn't be consuming meat. \n\nJust like them, though, I'm pretty up front about my food allergies (tree nuts), of course I'm going to be vocal about it, because consuming it could kill me, but you don't see people making the same jokes/memes out of it. \"A vegan walks into a bar....I only know because they told everyone.\" If I were a vegan, yeah, I'd be the same amount of vocal about it, \"hey, what ingredients does this have, i'm vegan.\"  For some reason, this upsets some people for reasons beyond my understanding. I've never seen a carnivore/omnivore actually get mad at a vegan/vegetarian in real life, I did experience a boss of mine make fun of a vegetarian coworker, but neither came off as preachy, and both seemed to take it in good fun.\n\n\n\n**Social media:**  \npeople seem to like this blanket feeling of anonymity, they don't care whose feelings they hurt by expressing their opinions in the psuhiest ways possible. \n\nUsing a popular group on facebook as an example, where people are creating floods of crappy AI images for every random thought they have. I see more posts making fun of vegans/vegetarians than I do the other way around, and normally these people seem to want to fight EVERYONE in the comments section. It's like they are offended and physically repulsed by someone who doesn't want to eat meat. It's like their entire existence is built on tryint to either make someone else mad or bully them.\n\nOn very rare occasions do I encounter a \"preachy\" vegan/vegetarian, that actually elaborates on WHY they do it (cruelty, slaughter practices, animal rights, etc)",

It's fine, and I don't mind doing it.\n\nI visit that same vegan friend's home, they INSIST that I eat whatever vegan meal they decide to make.  Also, they do not want me to bring my own food because they don't want the \"smell of meat\" in their home.  I acquiesce without complaint.\n\n* I've never personally met a vegan to make carnivorous food for their carnivorous guests.\n* I know many carnivorous allies who gladly make vegan food for their vegan guests.\n\nSo, there's that difference, and that can make one group feel much more \"rude\" and \"pushy\" than the other.  I know vegans have good reasons for why they refuse to prepare meat for others, but this \"refusal\" creates a perception of them treating others differently than they expect to be treated.",
            "I feel like this is some sort of weird straw-man where vegans and vegetarians are being lumped together and criticism of vegans is being treated as criticism of both vegans and vegetarians. The stereotype of \"pushiness\" or \"preachiness\" or \"feeling superior\" is primarily about vegans, and not especially about vegetarians. (To see that this is the case, look at the number of google search results for \"pushy vegans\" vs \"pushy vegetarians.\") And I think this reflects a real difference in how pushy/rude vegans and vegetarians are about their diets.",

If you went vegan because of these reasons, you believe someone else eating meat is morally wrong. It is logical to assume you have a moral duty to stop them from doing something morally wrong.\n\nA non vegan has no reason to change a vegan. The only time you tend to hear a non vegan doing stuff like that is mainly due to ignorance (which has lessened a ton over the years) or to be malicious.\n\nBig caveat that this probably varies based on your location. I live in a big liberal city which is very vegan friendly.\n\nI will also say that most vegans are not super aggressive about it. I did have the... pleasure of having a sibling who was a very aggressive vegan growing up. Thankfully they mellowed out. It did educate me a lot on vegan food though and i do consider myself 60% a vegan (i like dairy mostly). Part of this is because it is really important of me to support their beliefs when i cook for them, so i have cooked vegan quite frequently.\n\nAlso keep in mind that reddit is likely to overrepresent the really aggressive people or people who are just trolling.",

            "In my experience, vegans and vegetarians are both far less tolerant of ARFID. If I go to a carnivore friend\u2019s house and they want to serve me a meal - I just explain that I have ARFID and that it\u2019ll just be easier if I eat beforehand. Sometimes they try to ask a million questions about what I can and cannot eat to try to accommodate me. It comes from a good place but it drives me nuts cause it just adds to my anxiety. But they aren\u2019t *offended* that I want to eat beforehand and their responses are typically well intentioned and in good faith. \n\nWhen my vegan and vegetarian friends offer to cook for me and I explain it\u2019ll just be easier if I eat beforehand - they get offended and think I\u2019m making ARFID up to get out of eating vegan food. My friend\u2019s boyfriend actually refused to hang out with me because I wanted us all to get coffee (at a vegan friendly place) instead of having him cook for me. I went to coffee with my friend (without the boyfriend) and she drilled me for 20 minutes about what my problem is with vegan food (it\u2019s not vegan food per se that is the problem. It\u2019s just that I eat very limited things and it\u2019s easier for me to prep food myself). \n\nThat\u2019s just an anecdotal experience from someone with a pretty intense eating disorder. But it\u2019s another aspect of this topic that I think is worth exploring. I\u2019ve also experienced vegans telling me that their restrictions should be catered to over mine even though my restrictions are a diagnosed medical disorder and theirs are a choice (not saying we shouldn\u2019t cater to them too. I\u2019m saying - why not both?).",

            "Most of the vegans in my circle are pretty insufferable about it. They seem to take it as a personal affront that I am not vegan and frequently don't feel like I need to follow their path when we get together.\n\nAn example from recently, we go out to a restaurant. It was picked because it has both vegan and non-vegan options. I order a beer and get a 10 minute lecture about how I should order the cider because it doesn't subjugate animals. We move on to other topics of conversation. I order something with chicken as my entree and get another lecture. It was what looked good to me on the menu.\n\nSo, is it rude and pushy for me to order what I want? They seem to think so. Some of our friends just order vegan to avoid the conflict. We go to expensive but solidly mediocre restaurants to get a menu that caters to everyone and they behave like they get to sit in judgement over the rest of us.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, the vegans are otherwise great people who I enjoy having in my circle. Except when we go out for dinner.",
            "My experience might not change your view but here we go.\n\nI find that people get angry when they discover I am a vegetarian. For that reason I always try to keep it quiet. I was even called a child abuser once by someone who didn't like that I was a vegetarian. I dont talk about it. Definitely don't tell others what to do with their diet.\n\nSo my experience tells me that they're not just pushy, they're aggressive about their food preference.\n\nI have rationalized it by considering that my being vegetarian presents them with the idea that what they do is wrong. So even if I say absolutely nothing about it, they are feeling attacked and respond with hatefulness.",

Its like saying \"CMV: My dog barks\"",
            "Just a thought here as I agree with you that generally, most vegetarian/vegan types are pretty quiet about it, and generally, it's omnis who are assholes about the situation.\n\nCould this be because the vegetarian crowd really doesn't have to say anything. At this point, we all know the main reasons people choose these diets. (Environmental concern, health benefits, and animal cruelty). Like without even asking most people can just ascribe views to them that they see from radical vegans and the like so without realising it omnis become closed off without ever actually engaging with the individual and their own reasons for the diet they have. Although they'll probably be one of the three reasons I've said already but they may well not be concerned about anyone else's dietary choices.\n\nYou stack that on top of the fact that there really aren't many credible arguments for the people who eat meat aside from just selfish enjoyment (which is fine, eat what you want. Im not your dad). So the only answer is really to either accept the shame of \"doing something wrong\" or make it the other person's fault instead. Generally people are gonna deflect blame and so we end up with bitchy omnivores who are upset they are the bad guy and lash out.\n\nIn saying all of that though, there is also a little unspoken snobbery that goes with a vego diet just because, well, it is a statement. And they have picked that diet for a reason which challenges people",

I've said it before, because personally I am impressed with people who can give it up, especially when it comes to veganism, and never look back.\n\n\n>.

People normally cite reasons actually relating to health and fitness when they talk about eating meat.\n\nVeganism's morally superior attributes range from reducing animal suffering to saving the planet and reducing carbon emissions. In some versions Veganism is even the preferred diet to save your soul so that you can escape the cycles of reincarnation binding us to this Earthly plane of existence. These are great reasons to be vegetarian/vegan but has absolutely nothing to do with health and fitness so you'll excuse the non-vegans and non-vegetarians who get annoyed with Vegan reasoning.",

            "As an Indian, I think you have got the beef thing completely wrong. The beef thing with Hindus is like the pork thing with Muslims - it's a type of meat Hindus don't eat. So both Hindus who eat meat and those who do not eat meat would not touch it.\n\nMost Hindus in India to the best of my knowledge are not being forced to eat beef. Hindus being forced to eat beef is not the problem.\n\n The real problem is that the veg eating Hindu population tends to impose their views on the non veg eating population. You don't get murdered and discriminated against for eating beef - you face that prejudice for eating any meat (or non vegetarian food=) in general.\n\nIf you are interested OP, this has a lot of association with the caste based system that exists in India. The caste system is a class based system based on a person's birth. Of course like any other class based system, it considers certain people to be inherently better by virtue of their birth.\n\nPeople who eat veg tends to belong to the \"upper castes\". These people through years of oppression now hold most positions of power and money. From a religious and societal perspective, they are seen superior to the \"lower castes\". Naturally, these people have a lot of power to impose their views and food choices on others. \n\nIn some states, the situation is so bad that people eating non veg are not allowed to rent houses in apartments and complexes in good areas. It essentially creates a ghetto system where people belonging to certain castes and religions are forced to live in localities specific to them, just because of their food choices. \n\nThe situation is of course more complex and you need to understand the system in depth. But I can assure you OP that in India at least, you can get socially discriminated and shunned against because you eat meat in a lot of places.",
            "The thing about India is that a large amount of the population are Hindu, and that religion says that cows are sacred. So yeah, a lot of people in India would get very offended about being served beef, but that's because it's a religious belief, not necessarily because they're vegan. \n\nNot trying to argue your point, just thought that example needed a bit more explanation.",

            "There\u2019s a pretty common joke of \u201chow do you know if someone you meet is vegan? Don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll tell you over and over!\u201d While this is obviously a stereotype and generalization, I know several vegans, and they tend to make it part of their identity. This isn\u2019t as much the case with other groups such as vegetarians or gluten free, etc. A random example would be like if you meet someone and you give a 30 second intro to yourself, many would say things like their job, hobbies, if they are married or otherwise have a long term SO, maybe if they are a parent, etc. But most vegans will mention in that intro that they are in fact vegan. While as mentioned above, gluten free people or vegetarians aren\u2019t saying that\u2019s who they are, it\u2019s just how they eat. \n\nAnd it\u2019s more than that, with many of the vegans I know, they find ways to work it into a conversation. Someone at work has a new shirt and gets a compliment, and a vegan coworker will say out of nowhere unprompted when hearing that \u201cyeah but he is wearing leather shoes! I would never wear leather shoes!\u201d\n\nMaybe because it is being vegan is a lifestyle versus just an eating choice. It does require more thought on more things than just what to eat. But this bringing it into seemingly irrelevant situations makes many people feel like it is \u201cpushy.\u201d  \n\nAnd I will admit, that I am guilty of hearing when someone is vegetarian or vegan, I will say \u201cman I could never do that I like bacon too much\u201d or something like that. However, when I hear things like that, it is framed more as \u201cthis tastes too good to pass up\u201d and surprise that someone else doesn\u2019t feel like that too. While when a vegan especially, but a vegetarian sometimes says something like that, it\u2019s more with judgment as if someone who does eat meat is some villain for \u201cmurdering animals.\u201d",
            "So for many years I worked in the black market cannabis industry in Northern California. Doing so brought me into contact with lots of people from alternative lifestyles.

A lot of them would drop it after the first or second time but quite a few would keep pushing it.

I can buy an entire chicken for pennies. That's a real life life, that's the price.\u00a0\n\n\nWhy wouldn't they be vocal? Why wouldn't that make people uncomfortable?\u00a0",
            "You're not wrong. Non-vegetarians are just quieter about it. You rarely hear about a vegan pushing a vegan dish on someone who eats meat. On the internet vegans can be really vocal, but I haven't really had that kind of interaction IRL. A lot of vegans recognize that not everyone can be vegan, and realize it's a personal choice. \n\nOn the other hand, you hear about non-vegans pushing meat onto vegans or vegetarians pretty frequently, or tricking them into eating a dish that includes meat. It's not right that they do that. But they rarely have to be vocal about it either, because it's considered \"normal\" in the States to eat meat. And the States kind of set what's \"normal\" on the internet. \n\nI think vegans are kind of seen as pushy because they're constantly having to defend their side online. But really forcing someone to eat meat when they don't want to is a lot worse than just being pushy. \n\nI would probably never go completely vegan, since there's some pretty major restrictions that I disagree with. But I would try being a vegetarian if I found enough recipes that I like and can make regularly.",
            "I think the difference comes from popularity of veganism Vs religion, and the general attitude that religion is more \"valid\" than a lifestyle choice. Also even if it is fully understood as valid and reasonable, any kind of restrictions will lead to additional work or less choices for everyone around them, which might lead to annoyance. Additionally I feel like religions are way more homogeneous in each culture so people are way more likely to deal with vegans than other religions, and most of the resentment towards other religions for being pushy simply doesn't focus on food so vegans are more likely to be attacked specifically on that front",
            "I think the difference is that most western people consider meat central to a meal and may not even like any non-meat alternatives on offer. To some degree an invitation to dinner at a vegan\u2019s house isn\u2019t really a dinner invitation to a good chunk of people, it\u2019s an invitation to hang out for an evening around food you can\u2019t stomach.\n\nI get the rationale from a vegan\u2019s point of view, but people eat three times a day for their whole lives and if meat is at the center of those meals then technically you\u2019ve spent more time at the alter of meat than any other person has spent at any religious institution.

            "I don't think it's *just* the popularity issue, but also the universality of it.\n\nA religion is generally seen as something to restrict your own actions.  Even in religions where they attempt to convert you or enforce their religious views on you, very rarely are they attempting to enforce their dietary restrictions.  Like a catholic won't tell you that *you* can't eat meat (except fish) on fridays during lent, because that's a restriction that only applies to catholics, even if that same catholic will tell you that birth control is immoral and that any sex engaged in without the intent of procreation is a sin.\n\nIn contrast, veganism is generally agnostic of such a larger moral system.  And the moral arguments that come from it (eating meat evil / raising animals for meat is animal cruelty) tend to be applied much more broadly.  So there is not this same sort of distinction of 'this is something for me' vs 'this should be followed by all'.  And if someone has come to the conclusion that eating meat is unethical, then it's hard to understand what moral reasoning would say that it was unethical for person A but not person B.\n\nFurthermore, there is a vocal minority of vegans who go full \"that vegan teacher\" and only reenforce this view by saying that all flesh eaters are immoral animal abusers.  And the vocal minority effect is even stronger when you don't see that group very often.  You and I probably know dozens of catholics, so if one of them came up and said that eating red meat on a friday during lent was a sin, we would brush them off as a member of the minority fringe.  But when the first 5 vegans you met were all in full tilt, the 6th 'normal' vegan starts seeming like an exception.\n\nIt's also the case that it's easier for me to acknowledge and reject someone's view when it's clearly based on some other underlying beliefs that you don't share.  When it's a standalone view, it somewhat implies that this thing doesn't require a deity or holy book to convince you of, but that it's something everyone should be doing.",
            "IMO, if your vegan friend can't make you a palatable meal, it's either that they simply aren't good cooks or your palate isn't very broad. I'm an omnivore but cook lots of vegetarian or vegan dishes, including for friends. I think it is a mistake to try to do things that try to replicate meat unless you really know what you are doing. I think a vegan cook needs to look globally- many cuisines are a large part or primarily vegan or easy to make vegan, be it Indian, Greek, Romanian, Syrian, Ethiopian, Chinese, etc. Meat is expensive so many poor cooks figured out incredible vegetarian or vegan dishes over time. There are some really good recipes out there for meat replacements that I think many meat eaters would find to be fulfilling. I took some friends to a vegan restaurant in Milan and did a tasting menu. They were skeptical at first because they had a negative assumptions of vegan food but it ended up being one of the best meals we had on vacation throughout northern Italy. Cotoletta alla Milanese (basically schnitzel) made with seitan instead of veal was the winner of the night but everything was incredible.",

I\u2019ve known a lot of people who breed very small scale, just by the chickens natural breeding seasons, allow the hens to brood in their nest, and let the chicks grow with the hens.

To take an analogy, think about professional sports; the reason it's easier to play offense is you control the first cut and the defenders have to react to you.\n\nThe other variable is whether the person actually means to kill and is going to squeeze the trigger at the first moment of an action. I would think a robbery just wants to get the transaction done and isn't thinking to pull the trigger right away.\n\nEven in a situation like a home invasion, it's true that many home owners are killed over their own gun. It's because we think people will act like you do in videos or movies, but the part where someone is disarmed is because people aren't as primed to shoot to kill as you imagine and the difference in reaction time specifically in the disarming action. \n\nI think if you were just measuring someone's speed at pulling the trigger the first time they see a movement towards them then you're largely right -- it's also why I think cops who are involved in shootings, from what I understand, are trained to make that split second decision to shoot and do so.",

Always direct the muzzle away and then side step while advancing on them (to avoid exactly as you stated, a retreat to re-aim). You want to be past the gun and go for an eye gouge, head butt, upset to the solar plexus, elbow to the face/solar plexus, pressing kick to their front knee, etc. before you attempt to wrestle the gun from their arms because you need the gunman thinking about something else while you attempt to break their grip on the gun. \n\nTake downs are also effective at disarming a gunman because it's really hard to aim while falling, and being flattened to the ground will stun an attacker and slow their movements giving you enough time to get the gun out of their hands and the assailant into a hold.\n\nEven after years of drills I'm not confident in my ability against a practiced gunman and would likely comply to an armed person's commands. I would only attempt it if my life was genuinely in danger or the gunman wanted to move me (usually to a quiet place to kill you).",
            "In most police academies and CQB instructors will tell you to never get in arms reach of who is at gun point. They'll also teach you to keep your pistol tucked in if you're sweeping doorways so it doesn't become the first thing the defender can grab.\u00a0You aren't faster than a gun, you might not be faster than the guy reaching for it. It isn't about taking the pistol away, it's about grabbing it so it can't cycle, and in a capacity that it fires away from your direction. The pistol jams and becomes a very interesting paperweight and you turned a surrender into a fist fight.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThat all said, it's also taught if you're at gun point, don't attack unless your attacker is distracted, unless dying is your jam. Like everything else in life, it's all a balance.",
            "I 100% agree that people should not try it. Give up your valuables and don't really even look at them (they might shoot you just for getting a good look at them)\n\nWith that said,  the vast majority of people awho would every point a gun at someone (outside of War or the police or whatever) are not trained killers and don't want to shoot anybody. The goal isn't to get them to not fire the gun,  the goal is to get them to not fire the gun so it will hit you. In that way, any lapse in concentration could lead to an opening long enough to move out of their aim and grab for the gun.\n\nAgain, don't do it and dont believe those videos but it's not impossible.",
            "As someone who was a military police officer, I want to say that you are correct in saying that your first option should always be to give them whatever they are asking. However, we used to do training on gun disarming, and I would say that while you are correct that a gun can shoot faster than anyone can punch, it is also not relevant as you are trying to beat the other persons reaction with your action. Action is always faster than reaction.\n\nAs part of the training I went through, we would use simu-nition rounds (essentially chapstick rounds that would sting but not injure you when fired) that were fired from stock Beretta m9's. The shooter would be instructed that they cannot fire until you move and to only hold the gun with one hand (broken fingers were a risk otherwise), you would be instructed to strip the weapon from the shooter by grabbing the upper portion and turning it inwards to break the shooters grip. 9/10 times the weapon would be stripped before it went off. Of course, this is with the weapon more or less in your face and with your hands up in a surrender pose. The same was done when the shooter was behind you while pressing the gun against your back and only about 4/10 times did the shooter fail to fire. \n\nStrength is not particularly relevant in this as you turn the gun to the inside of the shooters grip, it's a natural break point that does not require strength, the grip is weak because of the way the gun is held and really to stop the gun from firing you only need to be strong enough to slide the chamber back if they are using two hands to grip it. Speed is helpful but ultimately, action beats reaction, so you would only need to be as fast as the other person or even slightly slower. \n\nI do want to point out that the conditions of the exercise were what allowed the weapon to be stripped regularly. Without your hands up and the gun within reach, it is logical to say that your chances decrease. \n\nTo summarize; taking a gun from someone is possible under the right conditions, but not worth betting your life on. It should only be attempted if you assume they will kill you anyway.",
            "You should know that just because you are shot with a handgun, doesn\u2019t mean you are dead.\n\nThere\u2019s a few things about semiauto pistols people should know - one is that grabbing it by the slide as hard as you can jam the gun. This works because the slide needs to travel back all the way and move forward in order to chamber the next round. There\u2019s a high likelihood that if you grab it, the first shot will go off and then the gun jams. It requires 2 hands to fix the jam.\n\nThe other issue is that the slide needs to be fully forward in order to fire a shot in the first place. This means if someone were to jam the gun into you as hard as they could the slide can \u201cslide\u201d back a few millimeters disabling the gun. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s possible to do what they show, but I am saying that semiautomatic pistols don\u2019t work 100%, a 100% of the time.

            "No one will hold a firearm close enough for you to take it? I have to disagree there. Most of the people who are going to use a gun for non lawful purposes have no education on the distance needed to keep your firearm in your own hands. It may have been decades ago, but I was taught the ten foot rule. If you are less than 10 ft away, don't reach for the firearm, as the defender has time to close the distance before you could pull it, aim it and fire it. After a quick google, they say a person charging toward you with a knife or other sharp-edged instrument can travel 21 feet in the time it would take you to recognize that there is a threat, draw your firearm, and fire two shots. I think this modern, researched by scientists info supports the old 10ft rule fairly well.\n\nIf you already have the firearm out, I would say 5 ft. Stay at least 5 feet away and don't blink or turn your head or point the gun anywhere else. Still safer at 10ft, a lot of people can cross that 5 feet in a blink, like if you were to sneeze or even look the other way one half second.",

The attacker has to basically be an idiot, threatening you with no intent to kill, they have to be close to you, and you need to catch them off guard. If the gun is already pointed at you it's probably too late to try anything. You would need to catch the attacker as they are moving about. These are super low percentage techniques and this scenario is so rare that I wouldn't bother ever training this to the degree needed for proficiency.

            "I generally agree with you. Giving up your valuables and/or training to be a fast runner are better bets than trying to disarm a gunman the vast majority of the time.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, in a purely hypothetical exercise, if you're going to fight back, it's not impossible. First, you need a distraction. Any competent person holding a gun can shoot you way faster than you can disarm them. Thankfully, muggers aren't very competent, and they are relying on getting this over with quickly to not be caught. Mind games can work here. Look over the assailants shoulder and say, \"What do you guys want?\" In a frightened tone. A lone mugger is going to shit his pants if you sell that right. No way he doesn't turn his head to look behind him. That's your 0.5-1s distraction to close the gap.\n\n\nFor actually disarming the guy, you either need to be armed, much stronger, or be quick and well trained. If you have a knife or strength on your side, disable the hand. Grab the barrel of the gun to control it with one hand, then stab the wrist, hand, fingers, whatever you can reach. You dont have to be stronger if they can't actually use their hand.\n\n\nIf you're unarmed and you don't outmatch them in strength, your only chance is overwhelming them with one or two blows. That's all you will have time for in the space of a distraction. Your best bet is a thunderous kick to their nuts. Kick harder than you ever have, ideally controlling the barrel of the gun with one hand at the same time. There's no way 95% of people could take a righteous slam to the family jewels and still wrestle a gun away from another able-bodied person. Their strength advantage goes out the window.\n\n\nThat said, you know what is way safer? Giving them what they ask for. Most muggers are not killers. Surprising them by doing something they don't like is the best way to get them to act irrationally. Running away can also be a strategy if you're a decent runner and you both start with some distance. Very few people are good at hitting moving targets at any amount of range, and one hit probably wouldn't take you down. You only need to get somewhere where there are other people.",

If the guy shoots you, it's almost a guarantee he will be put in prison for it. On the other hand, if you just give him your stuff and let him go, there's a high liklihood he'll just end up shooting another innocent person some day.\n\nA high price to be sure, but I don't doubt there are some who believe it may still be worth it just to cut that cancerous tumor out of our society forever, making our streets just a little bit safer.",

            "Gun defense can be understood with the acronym RCAT. (Redirect, control, attack, takeaway) The most important part of a gun disarm is redirecting the weapon to not point at you. The amount of movement necessary to redirect a firearm is quite minimal, and it's entirely within the realm of possibility for someone to learn to do with a reasonable amount of training and practice. As others have mentioned, there is a significant first-mover advantage, and most attackers aren't expecting you to go for their gun.\n\nOnce you've redirected the weapon (and often as part of that redirection), you establish control over the weapon's line of fire so it can't be easily pointed back at you, attack the wielder to put them on the defensive, and use biomechanics to take the gun away. (Most means of redirecting the weapon/controlling the line of fire aren't especially pleasant for the person with the gun, so people can generally be convinced holding onto it is no longer in their best interest once fingers start getting bent in directions they're not supposed to go.) While being stronger never hurts, with an understanding of the biomechanics it is far from necessary to disarming an armed assailant.\n\nYou've correctly identified that any self-defense situation comes with the questions of \"could you?\" and \"should you?\" If it's possible to defuse a situation without violence (such as handing over your wallet) or if trying to disarm an assailant might put additional people in harm's way, you're probably better off picking another option.",
            "TLDR: They do work, it's just not a one-size-fits-all solution. It's not about strength or speed. It's about their concentration. If they are distracted, you can beat them consistently. It's an option when the conditions are right, and it's worth knowing how to do it and when the time is right, and when it's not worth doing at all. Don't learn disarms off of youtube.\n\nLong:\nYou say \u201cnobody would X\u201d but in fact people would and do. You assume that anyone who would hold someone up at gunpoint is competent with a weapon which is not always the case. There are tons of videos of people holding up liquor stores or knocking off randos in dark alleys with 0 inkling of weapon retention or range advantage. People mistakenly believe \u201cI have a weapon, I have power\u201d, and this can be exploited in a lot of ways if you know what you\u2019re doing. If you try to take a weapon from someone, they will generally focus on controlling the weapon, leaving them open to be attacked in other ways (eye gounging, groin kicks, whatever). Now they're blind and also not in full control of a weapon.\n\nA disarm can work consistently well against someone who is nervous/scared/chemically altered/bad with guns/not paying attention, which is the point. It's not a \"solve everything\" option. It's a tool to use when the condition is right, and as the person wielding the weapon, something to be aware of and protect yourself against.\n\nFor example, even as professionals (ie: SWAT) doing room clearing it takes practice to make sure you\u2019re not putting your weapon through a door frame in such a way that someone hiding can\u2019t attempt to take it from you from a position of surprise (because even if you expect it going through a doorway, you don\u2019t know if/when it will happen). \n\nA one handed grip is weak on a handgun and twisting it in the right way can break your hold, especially if you're unprepared, because imagine holding a stick and someone trying to twist it out of your hand - its two hands against one thumb. On a carbine or rifle, the longer barrel can give more leverage to at least control a weapon. You have mechanical advantage when trying to take a gun from someone because all guns are levers and you're using the long end to your benefit. So strength is not explictly a factor.\n\nAt the end of the day, when it\u2019s gun vs. hands, you already have a significant disadvantage, and unless you are trained at disarms and good at identifying competence and timing, and have absolutely no choice, disarms are not worth your life for an iPhone and a credit card. But if the choice is to die after digging your own grave or roll the dice, I know what I'd choose (because fuck all that digging). You can consistently win if you know what you\u2019re doing against an inferior opponent if you are calm and confident against a person that's holding someone up for the first time in their lives and is an absolute mess emotional mess. Act scared for example and the person may come closer to double down and threaten you, which gives you that moment where you can exploit the situation.\n\nLike most fighting, if you have equal or lesser training and one person has a weapon or some other advantage, it\u2019s bad. If you have sigificant skill and knowledge advantage, the other person\u2019s physical size or equipment might not be enough of an equalizer to make an easy win for them. Tons of historical data to back those facts up. But also any fight you get away from and live is the best fight, even if you just ran for it. Most fights guarantee you'll get hurt in some way unless you have overwhelming advantage (see: knives).\n\nMy favourite disarm story was on a basic army course, an instructor gave a troop a blue (training) gun and said \"point this at me, and yell BANG when I make a move for it\". The troop was standing about two arm's lenght away (about 5 feet). \"Ready?\" the troop says \"yea\", arm extended pointing the blue gun at the instructor's face just within reach if someone tried to grab at. The instructor just straight up slapped the pistol out of the guy's hand with his palm against the side of the handgun and it went flying without the troop even moving a muscle. It was the funniest thing we ever saw. The troop knew it was coming, was \"ready\", and yet 0 retention (because he had no experience). I wouldn't try it except for laughs during training, but it did work. \n\nSome people don't know how easy it is to get a weapon off someone and they are your candidates for disarms.",

Which means it can also kill faster. You could not beat that even if you tried to. Nobody will just hold their gun out for you to grab. If you try to grab the gun, they will pull it back and shoot you.\n\nYou're over estimating people. Most people in a situation like that are stressed. Gunman included. All it takes is you trying something or someone walking around the corner to make the situation volatile. If there's 3 or 4 of you that also means split focus. You're not faster than a bullet but you could be a fraction faster than the hand that pulls the trigger. Still immensely stupid to do but not as silly as outrunning bullet fire.",

Others have noted reaction times, and that gets even more significant in a serious situation where tension is high for the attacker unless they are well trained. The key to speed is being relaxed.\n2) You don\u2019t need to move very far to dodge. Most techniques involve pushing the weapon one direction while moving your body the other direction. The expectation is that you may got shot, but not critically, as you are moving the weapon away from your core toward the distal parts of your body.\n3) They key to disarms is usually not strength but leverage. Once you grab the weapon, you don\u2019t pull on it, you twist, attacking in a direction that your opponent\u2019s wrist is weaker.\n4) People who do this train.

        "content": "TL;DR - the way that the UK passed the laws to make the Rwanda plan work undermines sending people to Rwanda as a deterrent against seeking asylum in the UK  \n  \nFor those not in the know, the UK's Rwanda plan was as follows:\n\n\"On 14 April 2022, the UK government announced that it was going to send certain people seeking asylum in the UK to the Republic of Rwanda, where the Rwandan government would decide their asylum claims. If their claims were successful, they would be granted asylum in Rwanda, not the UK.\"\n\n[The Migration Observatory](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/commentaries/qa-the-uks-policy-to-send-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda/#:~:text=On%2014%20April%202022%2C%20the,in%20Rwanda%2C%20not%20the%20UK)\n\nRead the link for a more detailed overview\n\nThe reason the policy is stupid is because it obviously is the UK shirking its responsibility when it comes to asylum. International human rights law is very clear on this point. Everyone has right to claim asylum wherever they like. It does not specify that you have to get to the nearest \"safe\" country or anything like that.\n\n[This is true in the UK as it is elsewhere](https://fullfact.org/immigration/can-refugees-enter-uk-illegally/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=advert&utm_campaign=immigration&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwydSzBhBOEiwAj0XN4ESq2_G0gADLf7T4JqAdesBOfkTmW9BOy0V6b-pyj6Ie-PYjXm2eqRoCqP8QAvD_BwE)\n\nHowever it is more than just stupid, it's self contradictory.\n\nThe logic behind the plan was a deterrence. The idea being that people would not want to seek asylum in the UK because they would end up getting sent to Rwanda instead. This only works as a deterrent if Rwanda is somehow a \"Bad\" place, somewhere that it would be bad to go to etc.\n\nWhen the UK's Supreme Court ruled on the initial Rwanda plan, they concluded that it would breach the UK's human rights obligations because Rwanda was not safe enough to have people effectively processed there (the Migration observatory link explains this in more depth).\n\nThe UK government's response to this was to then pass a law saying that for all official intents and purposes Rwanda was to be classified as \"Safe\". This was the government's way of circumventing the supreme court.\n\nLeaving aside the asinine nature of going about things this way, surely the fact that the UK Government has in fact specifically legislated that Rwanda is indeed \"safe\" now undermines the deterrence factor of the entire plan in the first place. After all, Rwanda is safe - so says the house of commons itself! So... how is that a deterrent. If you claim asylum in the UK, you will be sent somewhere else that's just as safe?\n\nSo... can someone explain how this policy ever made sense?\n\n",

            "Yeah but the people abusing the asylum system don't want to live in Rwanda. They want to live in the UK.\n\nYes sure most of the real asylum seekers won't care. But they are trying to deter the economic migrants posing as asylum seekers. Which is a decent chunk of them.\n\nFurthermore international law does not trump the countries domestic immigration law. If their immigration law says no migrants. Then that is what it is.\n\nYou will be seeing a lot of this in the near future. The experiment has been tried and it's an utter disaster.",
            "You may see it as immoral, but it was perfectly logical. A person is crossing to UK from France and France by all standards is a very safe country. Therefore we may assume that lack of safety is not their primary motivation for the journey. They take the boat because they want to live specifically in the UK for some different reason.\u00a0\n\n\nTherefore promising to send them to Rwanda is a perfect deterrent. They know they will not achieve their goal of living in the UK. And if Rwanda is truly safe, the channel crossing would neither improve nor decrease their safety. So there is a very little incentive to cross.\u00a0",
            "It\u2019s a deterrent for economic migrants that come under the guise of seeking asylum, this is not all asylum seekers but likely a significant enough portion of them. The point being that if your goal is to get into the UK for the economic benefits, then the possibility of ending up in Rwanda might discourage you from attempting in the first place as while Rwanda is not a bad place, it\u2019s definitely not on the level of the UK economically.",

The source you used relies on decision made in the UK, but that's not how international law regarding refugees works. \n\nThe UK can legally return the refugees to wherever they came from, assuming that was a safe country. \nThe responsibility is definitely on the \"nearest\". country because they can't send the refugees back (that would violate international law).",

            "Not stupid at all. The vast majority of asylum seekers are themselves abusing the UK having passed through many safe countries to reach the UK.

            "# Laying out the problem\n\n**Point 1)** It is well established that a large proportion of those that claim asylum after small boats crossings are from safe countries. Please see home office statistics published here to verify. \n\n**Point 2)** As others have noted, the fact that asylum seekers are crossing from France and have often traversed much of Europe to get to Calais before making the boat crossing also implies they have decided not to claim asylum in a number of safe countries along the way. \n\nThese two points quite naturally lead many to conclude that a significant (not necessarily majority) proportion of those crossing by small boats are doing so for reasons other than their safety. It seems a fair assumption that the majority of those that travel from safe origin countries are in fact doing so for economic reasons, or to join family. \n\nWe also have an enormous backlog when it comes to asylum applications. We should carefully consider anyone who is offered the right to live in our country from a safety and fairness perspective (i.e. legal migrants). \n\n**My claim:** Migration can put a burden on indigenous communities\n\nWe should also respect the expectation of UK citizens to not have their homeland changed significantly by outside cultures if they do not wish to do so. This is not a question of rejecting outright different cultures but controlling the numbers and concentrations within the UK so that the character of our country does not change drastically. \n\nUnskilled migration also puts more strain on our shared public goods e.g. NHS. More people in general also means more cars, homes, schools are needed. \n\nI would finally make the proviso, the asylum system is a good and moral standard that we have committed ourselves to under international law. Offering genuine asylum is a noble ideal. \n\nI hope we can agree up to this point. \n\n# Rwanda Scheme Logic\n\n**Economic Deterrent -** As noted Rwanda is poorer than the UK. Economic migrants should not wish to go to a country that is potentially poorer or close economically to their country of origin. \n\n**Safety -** For this scheme to work Rwanda must be a safe country otherwise they could never offer genuine asylum. Personally, I think this is the weakest claim of the government's. As a country that suffered a relatively recent genocide I am not convinced of how safe it is and clearly this is contentious. IMO the logic of an economic deterrent is sound and not immoral, however a clearly safer country than Rwanda would have been a better option if one could be found.\n\nBut let's assume that it is a safe country for argument's sake. Your claim that by choosing what might be considered a safe country the Rwanda scheme is contradictory is false. The point is not to put asylum seekers in danger, rather it should be to deter economic migrants whilst also offering a safe and welcoming new homeland to those who have fled the most desperate conditions. \n\n**Shirking asylum responsibility -** This would not be true if Rwanda were indeed safe. If every rich nation in the world having such an agreement with poorer countries such as Rwanda lead to all asylum seekers being granted a new home in safe countries then then the moral intent of the asylum system would have been fulfilled and the world would be a better place.\n\nWe have a moral duty to help those in need, that does not necessarily mean the only way to do so is by helping them in one's own homeland. Unfortunately, Rwanda does not appear to be a de facto safe country so in that sense the plan was doomed to failure. However, I hope I have convinced you that its logic was not self-contradictory.",

Rwanda can be a \"bad\" place, while still being \"safe\". plenty of countries are \"safe\" in the sense that there is a functioning government and no civil war but still a \"bad\" place in the sense that they have a lower standard of living, far less generous welfate etc.",

The nature of asylum is that they will return in the medium term when the threat is no longer present.\n\nFirstly I readily understand the distinction. My point here was simply that people who come here for the long term will have an effect and require adjustment from the local populace. If we believe a significant portion of those arriving on our shores are in fact 'economic migrants' this does invoke this part of my argument. Lastly, I think you are mistaken on the reality of asylum seekers ever leaving. In reality asylum seekers can gain Indefinite Leave to Remain after 5 years in the country and then full citizenship after a further 1 year from then. The vast majority of asylum seekers are going to settle in the UK after they are granted asylum. Furthermore, very few of the sorts of conflicts and crises that lead to people claiming genuine asylum are going to be solved anywhere near to the sort of timeframe of 5/6 years. I simply point this out as a matter of information. I'm absolutely fine with genuine asylum seekers being granted asylum in the UK. \n\n>This contradicts your earlier statement, namely\n\n>\n\n>Why would the \"migrants\" here put less of a burden on Rwanda than the UK?\n\nMy full argument is that there is an upper limit on the number of both migrants and asylum seekers that any one nation can be expected to receive (those may be two separate limits rather than a combined limit), after that limit there are significant issues in integration of cultural norms and for infrastructure - that is the burden I refer to. A small percentage of net migration is not going to have a noticeable impact on your culture/quality of life. Some level of migration is probably a net positive for a country, but it is increasingly felt in the UK that we have had too much immigration since the 90s. People arriving on our shores  by small boats are relatively few compared to legal migration i.e. people simply coming here to work/study etc. and then becoming full citizens. I do not think Rwanda has had anything like the levels of migration we have experienced so assuming their populace is comfortable welcoming new cultures there will be relatively little burden placed upon them. Furthermore, this ignores the fact that the UK government is paying quite a significant amount (\u00a3100s of millions) for this deal to ever begin. So there will likely be a net positive to the Rwanda economy.",

            "If you traveling to live with family or have special language preferences, you\u2019re not asylum seeking, you\u2019re immigrating. If you need to flee a country, then flee",
            "By this logic the US must be a shite country.",
            "You've not answered the question. Should we punish white people as a group? They cause a much much higher percentage of crime? Is it okay if I take away your rights because of the crimes that *people like you* commit?",
            "Yes you can.",
            "You can't deport citizens because of international law, which according to this thread isn't relevant if a country passes a domestic law allowing it.",
            "From like three replies up the thread:\n\n>I would love for them to give criminals a choice between time in prison or citizen revocation and a one way ticket to Rwanda. Or wherever long as they are out of our hair. Regardless of race.\n\n>You must think I hate only criminals of certain races. No I hate them all.

            "Is it though? Violent crimes are terrible but they also tend to be pretty minimal in terms of actual lives impacted. White collar crimes on the other hand frequently impact thousands of people. And when you consider the real world impacts of white collar crimes, they are often just as if not more atrocious in terms of the harm they cause as \"violent\" crimes. Starting a bar fight is a violent crime, embezzling charity funds intended to provide life saving treatments to sick kids in 3rd world countries is a \"white collar\" crime. Personally, I find one of these actions FAR more objectionable than the other.",

            "You are just repeating racist talking points. When you say \"certain populations\" exactly which populations are you referring to? Is it, business owners engaging in wage theft? Multi-millionaires committing tax fraud? Police officers who abuse their spouses??? Or are you only worried about crimes when they are committed by asylum seeking immigrants?",

            "You don't want them to migrate, you don't think it's acceptable to live where they are, so what do you want people to do. Based on your previous answer you seem to think the best solution is mass suicide. Please point out how this isn't logical based on your own responses?",
            "You can't immigrate legally without filing paperwork through your country. If you have to flee your country, there is NO WAY TO LEGALLY IMMIGRATE ANYWHERE.\n\nSomeone who is genuinely fleeing their country for good reasons should be allowed to claim asylum in the country they have connections or speak the language.\n\nEvery country should do their part to help refugees who are forced to flee - ESPECIALLY the ones who contributed to causing the wars these people are often fleeing. The UK takes less refugees than most countries do. We shouldn't be trying to offload more."

A presidential election poll in swing states are the only ones that matter. \n\nAny focus on how California or Wyoming will vote is just extra fluff.  This type of election doesn't care if you win 100-0 in California.  It alone won't garner a candidate victory.\n\nThe only thing that matters is swing state polls.

            "Swing states change fairly frequently so the problem isn't that only swing states matter, which is true, but rather predicting which states are going to be the swing states.\n\nFor example Indiana was not considered a swing state in 08 since it's dependably red and yet went to Obama narrowly. There are innumerable instances of this.\n\nPolling outside known swing states can help determine how close to being a swing state (in past elections) a non-swing state (in future elections) is.\n\nEDIT: Didn't see this bit at the end:\n\n> the current projections are going to result in an incumbent losing while winning the popular vote for the first time.\n\nThis is not the first time the EC elected someone who didn't win the popular vote. It also occurred in 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016.",

If the President is fine with being 7 million votes underwater and winning on a technicality, there\u2019s nothing in place to actually stop him from doing that.",

            "You're correct but I didn't think it's the \"incumbency\" part of that comment which is important so my comment doesn't mention that aspect.",
            "But they said she was probably going to win but then she didn\u2019t win so therefore all polling forever is wrong.",
            "And many will. I would bet my life savings that ny and California vote biden this election.",
            "That's a misunderstanding of what polls said. People were predicting Clinton had a higher chance of winning based on polling. There's still a margin of error and pollsters also had up to 30% chance of Trump winning which is almost 1/3.\n\nAnd now I see the sarcasm. You got me."
