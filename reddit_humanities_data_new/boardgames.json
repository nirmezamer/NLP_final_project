            "Me and my boyfriend love 7 duel we have all the expansions we also have some cute games like sabobatage. My personal favourite that we have played together is Watergate. He enjoys complex and strategic games and I do as well, we like war themes or something with a good story that plays at around 2 hours or so. We aren't really looking for a quick 20 minute game but one that plays longer with more strategy and depth. Looking to buy one today has anyone got any recommendations? Thank you! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nWe are looking for 7/10 complexity\n\nWe have enjoyed:\n7 Duel\nSabobatage \nWatergate \n\nWe have not enjoyed:\nMusket and Pike\nPandemic (we are not into cooperative more competitive games!)",
            "Twilight Struggle might be right up your alley.",
            "**War Chest** is a great chess-like game with a unique bag building mechanic and satisfying weighted poker chips for pieces. Each player controls 4 unique units that are different from what their opponent has. A pregame unit draft makes things even more enjoyable. Games take an hour or so.  \n\n**Targi** is a 2P worker placement game that any fan of 7WD should try. It\u2019s completely different gameplay, but both games have this nice tension between choosing something that\u2019s good for you and something that hurts/blocks your opponent. Targi combines these two forces in a really interesting way. 45-60m playtime.\n\nBe careful asking for a \u201c7/10\u201d complexity game around these parts of the internet; people might start recommending Lacerda games. BoardGameGeek complexity/weight ratings for 7WD and Watergate are both under 2.5 out of 5, aka 5 out of 10.  \n\nHere\u2019s a BGG search for games that support 2P, have a weight/complexity of 3 to 3.5, and take 1.5-2.5 hours to play: [LINK](https://boardgamegeek.com/search/boardgame?sort=bggrating&advsearch=1&q=&include%5Bdesignerid%5D=&include%5Bpublisherid%5D=&geekitemname=&range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmin%5D=&range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmax%5D=&range%5Bminage%5D%5Bmax%5D=&range%5Bnumvoters%5D%5Bmin%5D=&range%5Bnumweights%5D%5Bmin%5D=50&range%5Bminplayers%5D%5Bmax%5D=2&range%5Bmaxplayers%5D%5Bmin%5D=2&range%5Bleastplaytime%5D%5Bmin%5D=90&range%5Bplaytime%5D%5Bmax%5D=150&floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmin%5D=&floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmax%5D=&floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmin%5D=3.0&floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmax%5D=3.5&colfiltertype=&searchuser=sideburns&nosubtypes%5B0%5D=boardgameexpansion&playerrangetype=normal&B1=Submit)  \n\nSo maybe check out Terraforming Mars? Or one of its slightly more approachable siblings, Ares Expedition or TM Dice Game. I would not buy Scythe for 2p. And games like Puerto Rico and Power Grid also need at least 3p to work, and are best at 4.  \n\nThere\u2019s a tier of games just slightly lighter than the above search results, which would include things like **Lost Ruins of Arnak** and **Great Western Trail** and even classic worker placement games like **Agricola** and **Castles of Burgundy** - maybe check some of those out?"

            "After nearly 20 years of faffing about with an electric guitar and getting almost nowhere (I can manage about 4 chords, suck at changing from one to another, but can pick out a simple melody reasonably well), I finally realised where my guitar heart truly lies. I bought myself an acoustic guitar this week, and I am so excited about playing and learning again. I love the way it feels and sounds.\n\nWhat musical instrument can you play? Or what instrument do you wish you could play? I'd actually love to learn the violin but don't think I'd have the staying power to get through the squeaky phase.",
            "Thanks to an unexpected couple of flights and not having wired headphones/having a laptop with no BT, I got a bunch of reading time and finally made it through *The Silmarillion*. I'd started it a couple times in the past and got totally bogged down in it, and... well, I still kind of got bogged down and feel like I should have been able to finish it much more quickly. I have the 2nd edition, which includes a letter from Tolkien where he was trying to justify to his publisher that they should publish it alongside LotR and describing what his vision was. In that context, I see what he was doing, but... I don't know, in the end it was a little too dense for me.\n\nAnd then, for something much lighter, there was [*Help Fund My Robot Army!*](https://www.johnjosephadams.com/projects/help-fund-my-robot-army-other-improbable-crowdfunding-projects/) \n\nBut mostly at this point I'm excited that my hold of *Tidal Creatures*, the newest in the series that started with *Middlegame*, is marked as in transit at the library.",

Well I'm 40 now, and I can now play Claire de Lune and a few Ghibli tunes, compose my own music, etc. Highly recommend just chipping away at it! Helps to have lessons just to force yourself to practice once a week :)",
            "I play all the things! Kind of. I'll spare you the rambling details of my history on various instruments, but in no particular order, I will at least pretend to play guitar, bass, drums, and piano, and have recently been messing around with mandolin and banjo. (Guitar is the only one I'm relatively competent at, but I've recorded with most of them.) \n\nThe one I most wish I could play well is a [Chapman Stick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2NpYDRwNo8), but I just haven't been able to get it to click. And yeah, the struggle with violin is real... I was working on something last summer that I really wanted a violin on, just one held note, and after probably 10 minutes of not being able to get a good take I decided the track didn't really need it that badly.",
            "It's very dense - you really have to be a \"lore\" person to get through it I rkn. It might help to pick up one of the newer \"revised\" versions of the stories from the Silmarillion which were published by his son, Christopher Tolkien; The Children of H\u00farin, Beren and L\u00fathien or The Fall of Gondolin. I recently read the standalone \"The Fall of N\u00famenor\", and while it is somewhat dense, it was a better read than my first time through.",

            "I really want to be able to play chords too, but have accepted that for me it will be a long and painful struggle. I'm getting there, just very slowly. Melodies come more naturally to me.",
            "Life is a bit hectic at the moment so lessons aren't an option. But I'm aiming for 10 minutes meaningful practice a day (by which I mean picking something to learn or improve and working on it). Sometimes 10 minutes turns in to half an hour once I get started. I did the same with learning to draw 5 years ago and went from awful to okay in that, so I'm hoping the same approach will work here.",
            "Yeah, I was at one bookstore or another a couple days ago and they had a bunch of copies of The Children of Hurin, and it was an interesting comparison of it being ~250 pages vs The Silmarillion having probably an overview of the tale in 20-30 pages. \n\nI also wonder if it's an age and/or time priorities thing. I first read LotR when I was probably 12 or 13 and I remember really enjoying it and presumably getting through it reasonably quickly. But then I decided to read it again in 2017 and it took me probably 7 or 8 months to get through, just feeling like a slog. I might've had more energy to try to be a \"lore\" person back then.\n\nThe Children of Hurin, Beren and Luthien, etc are kind of interesting in the context of that opening letter in this edition - the gist of it (as I recall anyway) was Tolkien saying England needed its own proper fairy tales/legends, because all it really had was Arthurian legend which is more Welsh, and so The Silmarillion was kind of intended as a broad legendary framework for a world that other people could write in. I'm not sure how to reconcile that vision with the estate though; I don't know how tight a leash they keep on Middle Earth, other than recalling that Peter Jackson's movies had only licensed the content that was actually in their respective books and weren't supposed to be able to use Silmarillion content to flesh it out.",
            "It certainly is intimidating... I had first tried to read it in high school and my recollection of it was there was a lot of Middle Earth equivalent of Biblical genealogy, which I got totally bogged down in. I had recently read that \"yeah the first 50 pages are like that but then it gets good\" so I resolved to get through it this time, and... I'm not sure that categorization is accurate. The first sections introduce a bunch of the Valar and Maiar, but most of them don't meaningfully feature throughout the rest of the tale. And there's plenty of genealogy throughout the rest of the book, complicated for me by various elves taking new names after things happen. (And maybe men, too, except at some point I also lost which were elves and which were men.)\n\nOn the other hand, last year I read John Rateliff's [*The History of the Hobbit*], which ties together a lot of things between The Hobbit, LotR, and The Silmarillion at least, and so it was interesting to finally fill in some of the gaps in topics Rateliff mentions. And I also have heard that there Amazon's *The Rings of Power* series hints at things in The Silmarillion, so maybe having some familiarity will help there too.\n\nSo...I don't know, for me it probably depends on how much you're interested in being a Tolkien/Middle Earth nerd. If you only have a passing interest, you might find the [Wikipedia synopsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion#Synopsis) sufficient to satisfy your curiosity on the history of the world and the rise of Sauron.",
            "Yeah that genealogy description is also what I've heard haha. I have an interest in that but I also know myself well enough to know I'll have a hard time remembering who's who if I don't write it down. Thanks for the breakdown!\u00a0"

In my opinion they should have made killing monsters not make the timer move. Instead it should've just taken more time to do combat (2 or 3 hours for each combat round). Then fighting too much would still run you out of time, but it would feel less arbitrary.",

You have a mission, and getting side-tracked by random monsters is not helping you achieve it. You are simply wasting time playing the super hero. Taple top RPGs and video games have taught us that you can ignore the main objective to focus on random side quests without any consequences, but that's not how it would work in real life.",

Only your band of heroes stands in their way. Will you succeed in defending the castle and protecting Andor?\r  \n\r  \n\u201cLegends of Andor\u201d is a cooperative board game for 2\u20134 heroes. Each hero takes on the role of a dwarf, archer, wizard, or warrior\u2013each with unique skills\u2013and all must work together to battle the ever-encroaching enemy forces.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Legends of Andor is a cooperative board game for two to four heroes. Live the legendary tales as you unite to battle ever-encroaching enemy forces.\r  \n\r  \nAfter the first Legend, more fantastic adventures ensue. You must find the witch and obtain a medicinal herb to cure the sick king. Help the prince repel the evil powers of the dark mage. In the ancient mines, you seek out precious gemstones \u2014 and uncover grave dangers. And finally, you must pit your skills against the mighty dragon, awakened from an age-old slumber. Can you triumph against these challenges? Only if you work together will you have the strength to be the true heroes of Andor.\"",
            "I feel like you're being ever-so-slightly deliberately obtuse.  Granted, there are no rules about types of gameplays being associated with certain themes, but there is a vast history to base \"preconceived notions\" on.\n\nIf you see a box with speeding race cars, you expect a certain thing.  Playing with a customer's expectations isn't a trick, but don't blame people for having very, very reasonable preconceptions.",
            "What part of that description are you drawing attention to? \n\nThe last paragraph reads:\n\n> \n> After the first Legend, more fantastic adventures ensue.\n> \n> - You must find the witch and obtain a medicinal herb to cure the sick king.\n> - Help the prince repel the evil powers of the dark mage.\n> - In the ancient mines, you seek out precious gemstones \u2014 and uncover grave dangers\n> - You must pit your skills against the mighty dragon, awakened from an age-old slumber.\n>\n> Can you triumph against these challenges?\n\nThere's no particular focus on combat, and I remember doing all those things. It felt epic and a fun cooperative puzzle. There's any number of thematic reasons why combat costs you time/resources, ideally avoided but sometimes necessary.\n\nYour complaint is so bizarre. Watching or reading any spoiler free review would have told you what to expect, mechanically. We can empathise that you feel hoodwinked but can't imagine you'd feel that way if you did your due diligence and research. Are you new to the hobby? Or at least new to the purchasing side of it?\n\nA second factor might be that this game has probably not aged so well in the face of more appealing modern designs, but it's been a long time since I played it so maybe it holds up better than I remember.",
            "I'm not trying to say that going into a game with preconceived notions is wrong. But if a game uses its theme in a way that you didn't expect, that's usually not an attempt at deliberately tricking you (as OP seems to imply). If every game could be judged by its cover, the hobby would be a lot more boring.\n\nI also don't think that expecting a fantasy themed game to automatically be sandboxy is necessarily warranted. There are lots of popular fantasy games that are more puzzly and have some sort of timer such as Gloomhaven, the Lord of the Rings LCG, Warhammer Quest card game, the Dark Souls / Bloodborn adaptations, just to name a few."

            "Somewhere Richard Garfield has a really excellent article discussing the design of it, starting with how quickly players are expected to gather mana and how everything about the game spins out of that. I haven\u2019t played in years and looking at the current cards confuses the hell out of me, but that article is probably essential reading for any game designer.",
            "I mean, honestly, it's pretty legendary. It innovated on so many gameplay mechanics we take for granted today and other games have built on top of - collectibility, the mana resource system, the color pie.\n\nIt's flexible enough to have lasted for 30 years and counting, and still have new innovations being built on top of it today, but the core fundamental mechanics are still clear enough that you could easily open a starter deck from decades ago and play it.\n\nThe only thing I would probably count against it is that the color pie occasionally gets imbalanced at any given period of time. I believe right now green is probably right now the more \"overpowered\" color, but at given times throughout Magic's history, it's been blue or black too. Some better Magic historians might know, but I can't think of a time off the top of my head when white or red would have been considered the dominant colors.",
            "I think it's very impressive how solid a system it is and that it hasn't completely buckled under its own weight. My positive feelings about it boil down to respect/admiration.\n\nAs a modern day game it's not at all my cup of tea though and kind of the antithesis of what I like about games. It's overly complicated, has lots of keywords that are constantly added to keep the game relevant, a million little micro-phases, awful mana system, boring combat, has necessary homework to understand new sets, is a TCG.",
            "I legitimately think that the mana system is a straightforward mistake. Nobody should lose to mana flood or mana screw as often as happens in MTG, and more modern similar systems (like Lorcana or Star Wars Unlimited) are straight-up improvements.",
            "For most games, the adage \"if I have seen far, it's because I stood on the shoulders of giants\" applies.\u00a0 Almost every game out there is building off of other ideas, which isn't a bad thing, generally.\u00a0 Using good ideas to make better ideas works great.\n\n\nFrom a game design perspective, Magic was standing on the shoulders of toddlers.\u00a0 It's absolutely incredible how seamless the design was given how little like it existed when it was made.\u00a0 It's like if the first movie ever made was Shawshank Redemption.\u00a0 Like, that's totally crazy that the first try for a TCG is inarguably top tier.\n\n\nPeople hate on the mana system, but it's actually really good.\u00a0 It creates so much variance in gameplay that you don't get in the other TCG's that \"improved\" on the system.\n\n\n\nAnd all that's not even touching on the fact that it's completely modular.\u00a0 There are dozens of ways to play, and you can even essentially use Magic as a framework to design your own games.\u00a0 It's called \"cube.\"\u00a0 You put together a pile of cards that you think will be cool, and you (and all the other players) draft from just that pile and pretend no other cards exist.\u00a0 It completely changes the power level of each card because it's always dependent on the cards around it.\u00a0 How many other games is that possible with?!\n\n\nI won't claim that Magic is perfect, but it's great.\u00a0 The designers make a lot of mistakes, but they make a lot more hits, and they've honestly had a pretty good track record.\u00a0 You can't get too mad when Tom Brady throws one interception, you know?",
            "Initially it was great. Unfortunately the rules drift from decades of expansion has made the game way too complex, IMHO.  If someone were to make a board game that is like a stripped down version of revised, I would buy that in a second.",
            "From a design gameplay perspective, it's a game where the biggest part of the gameplay, deckbuilding, happens outside of the actual game. Knowing how to play your deck is important, but owning a powerful deck is even more important.\n\nOf course it has financial reasons, but as we set this subject aside... Well, I think playing a game should happen during the game itself.",
            "It\u2019s the greatest TCG ever built. Mechanically it lives and evolves on today. It\u2019s a solid system with tons of constant creative innovation. It has its drawbacks and issues, but very few of them are mechanical. It\u2019s wild because even with the power creep of recent years, some of the most powerful magic cards of all time are the old cards. That\u2019s impressive game development.",
            "Magic is an incredible game. It wouldn't have been as successful as it has been if the base game wasn't fun and if they weren't good at refreshing it several times per year. If you are at all interested in games in this genre, and familiar with Magic, you could easily buy some carefully-chosen Magic cards, put them in a box, treat this as a board game, never buy another card, and have it be a 10/10 game... and one for which there are many many expansions available if you ever want them (though this might not appeal to players who are completionists). (You can also achieve this with proxies, if you want the expensive cards)\n\nIt is several games in one - for example, each new set is created for limited, competitive constructed, and casual constructed formats - and this means that some of its design choices are not ideal for any one of them. For instance, there are powerful rares for constructed that make limited less fun, and cards that are necessary for limited that won't be ever played in constructed. Though on the flip-side, it's pretty impressive that the same set of cards can be used for so many different formats. Some similar sacrifices are made due to its business model, for instance putting various necessary cards at higher rarities.\n\nThe mana system is often complained about, to the extent that there have been tens or hundreds of CCGs that have attempted to fix it. Most of them are dead.\n\nUnfortunately, it's both an expensive game, and one with a business model that has some problems... but this is tied to how great a game it is. Wizards is willing to spend a LOT of resources on making Magic a great game (seriously - it has whole departments of people working full-time on its design, compared to individual designers for most board games), because it makes them a lot of money, because it's selling gambling to kids.",
            "I love it. I mean there are TCGs out there that had better gameplay IMO, but they died out, VS being the most notable one for me. I think the most enduring thing about it is that it was created without being tied to another IP so they had no issues with licensing and other problems that other TCGs had",
            "Loved it as a kid. Haven't played once as an adult. Still have a decent sized collection dating back to 3e and Ice Age.\n\nThe game length and format is excellent. Ran some tourneys for fellow young people at the time. But even then I felt the need to sometimes do things differently eg 6 or 8 players at the same time to change things up. \n\nI think it's a genuinely great concept and game. But it's sat on my shelf for decades.",
            "I'm just a casual player, but I think overall it's great. My biggest complaint is complexity. There are so many ways to build a deck, so many cards to know and understand, so many mechanics and interactions to know and understsnd that it quickly becomes a chore. I have boxes of cards I'll never use simply because I don't have the time nor do I want to spend the time learning them all and figuring out how to use them in a deck. When me and my friend play I'm pretty sure we never play right because we forget half the things that should be happening as more cards are on the field.",

            "In terms of ideas for mechanics etc it is a goldmine. Have to put some respect on there.\n\nThe gameplay, rules clarity, and balance is a travesty beyond belief, same as any TCG. They got to sell the cards, so then balance goes completely out of the window. Players may spend a long while trying to get the rules right and interactions correct. Gameplay can drag as players set up infinites or have very long turns. I don\u2019t think any game of MTG will ever have half the balance or meaningful interaction between player that a game of say\u2026 **Baseball Highlights 2045** or **Air, Land, & Sea** might have. There are dozens of better competitive cards games that don\u2019t have the money problem that MtG (or any TCG) has, all while being easier to understand and imo more fun to play.\u00a0",

I've been looking into EDH recently, the moment to moment tactics that come from singleton decks is much more appealing, but there's still a hefty chance of becoming a slog.",

People just want to play what other people play, so that they have people to play with.",
            "Copy paste of a previous comment I\u2019ve left, slightly modified:\n\nWhen the pandemic started I got into Arena because it was something to sort of scratch the itch losing my weekly board game night created. I first started playing Magic when 4th edition came out (just missed the damn boat on having cards worth anything). I think I stayed in it for a couple sets but really didn't have many people to play with. So over the years off and on I'd get back into it for a set or release. Time Spiral. Innistrad (my favorite). I never played competitively but did do a few drafts and release nights. Drafts are fantastic and we'd do booster drafts with a group of friends occasionally. The Commander format came out and that's a ton of fun for casual players.\n\nI was familiar with the digital format due to having some previous versions of the ipad game that they discontinued, so I fell back into the old grind it out habit on Arena. I wasn't going to invest money in it at the time of the pandemic, but could earn my cards and rewards, visual upgrades, etc. So from March to probably September or so I played every day, got my daily rewards, and stopped. I reached Mythic 3 times, and almost a 4th at the end when I stopped altogether. I was playing a creature Gruul deck, and was very proud of myself since not many played that (it seemed anyway)\n\nI love Magic, but there are definitely problems with it: I\u2019ll speak to my arena experience more.\n\nArena basically forces you into the competitive . . . . arena. If you play for rank you're gonna get squashed by the netdecks. Then you think, ok I'll play unranked and still get my daily quests and wins. Then you realize that many netdeckers have the same idea. The Commander lite (forget the name) is fine, but the matches take longer, and 15 wins takes AWHILE. So you can't really escape this if you're playing to satisfy these \"free earnings\" to gain cards. In short: you gotta get your ass kicked a lot. If you never net decked before (I had not), it will push you to. I didn't want to netdeck, so I began playing a Gruul deck with Domri that very few were playing. This deck was steadily neutered thanks to all the card bans. But I was still getting to Mythic with it. Then the sets rotated out. I lost Domri and just about every power card that made the deck work. There were some new Gruul strategies introduced but they weren't the same style of play that I wanted.\n\nWhen I started Arena the life deck was big with Heliod Sun Crowned. In the middle it was the stupid cat (hate that fucking cat) and the sac decks. The insufferably long matches vs blue players who wanted to drop Agent of Treachery. Everyone playing Uro. When I quit it was mostly rogue decks but then Omnath hit and I just threw up my hands. I had just created the total anti-rogue deck which was fun as hell to play (pumped up stuff by banishing cards from your graveyard which the rogues were stacking), but Omnath on top of all the cards that were rotated out just broke the rest of the fun I was having. EVERYONE was playing Omnath. puke.\n\nIn short: Wizards has turned the game into a four round game. EVERY strategy outside of control counter seems aggro/ramp. Then whatever cards are powering that new four turn netdeck get banned. Looking at the number of cards banned pre 2000 and post 2000 is eye opening. (They obviously know these huge free economy cards are an issue but they release them anyway, only to ban them after making their money). \n\nBut aside from all that, I have to say it was the control and counter decks that just made me irrationally angry, and are why I keep walking away. I don't want to sit there for 15 minutes and have everything i do canceled, returned to hand, or taken. Who wants to play a game where they get to do nothing? Yeah you can play around the counters but blue was too strong when I quit. With 2 mana counter cards available and your opponent never tapping their lands on their turn (while continually dropping a land every turn) . . . ughhhhh. NO ONE is as smug as a blue magic player. At this point if I were playing casual I'd ask my opponent if blue was their main color and just not play them if it\u2019s a counter control deck cause I find it that un fun.\n\nThese days I really think magic is producing too much and flooding their market. There\u2019s no possible way people can keep up with the releases even if they wanted to. They\u2019re tying in so many IPs these days and pumping out the cash grab products. They did the whole ONE RING card release which was a first. Wizards also took a fan made format in commander and monopolized it. I have mixed feelings on that. Commander is a great format overall. There was the recent ai artwork scandal as well as the ceo stepping down (not as a result as far as I know), so I\u2019m curious to see where the game is headed. \n\nI think magic is a great game. I still love playing it casually, but it\u2019s definitely something that wears out its welcome at a certain point in a variety of areas.",
            "Love it. I know the rules of MtG are legendarily elaborate, but I much prefer having that level of detail than the opposite. I\u2019m part of a Frosthaven group and while I\u2019m really enjoying the game, I wish it had a more developed rulebook, a stack, and phases of priority. I think most games would benefit from a more rigorous approach to defining the rules.",
            "Easily one of the best games. Yeah there\u2019s a component of luck but also just insane strategic expression, from deckbuilding to sideboard decisions, bluffing, etc. I remember listening to a podcast a long time ago when I still played (I believe Gerry Thompson\u2019s) about all the intricacies of making one of the simplest decisions - do you block your opponent\u2019s attacking 2/2 creature early in the game? They spent an hour talking about it, when it was correct, what information it conveys to your opponent about your hand/intentions, etc. And there are dozens of these types of decisions (plus more complicated ones) in every game.\u00a0\n\nI believe one of the biggest design criticisms of the game is the mana/land system, which some describe as antiquated since the typical deck has like 1/3 of its being lands that you want to draw a certain number of early but then basically never draw them again after that threshold. But I think the system is amazing because it creates so much interesting design space around land cards, including enabling ramp decks, allowing for the existence of lands that are win conditions in themselves, and/or decks with the main strategy of winning from just lands. It also provides design space for cards and mechanics that smooth out mana/lands and gives the player agency to take the more conservative approach and include these smoothers or be more greedy. Also, it makes really efficient or powerful lands exciting cards. \u00a0\n\nAll that side, it\u2019s not perfect. It\u2019s hard to teach new players, especially if they\u2019re not highly motivated to learn. It has a ton of rules and very complicated rules interactions, to the extent that people have to essentially study and be certified as having a sufficient amount of rules proficiency to run/judge tournaments\u2026and even the best players in the world get rules wrong or don\u2019t know how things interact when new sets come out. Kinda like chess and a lot of 2p/abstract board games, it has a very steep learning curve (which has pros and cons) and it can be not fun to play someone of a much lower or higher experience and skill level of you. It\u2019s also gotten progressively rules complex and text heavy in their efforts to innovate as they have exhausted a lot of the simpler ideas/mechanics. And sometimes you win or lose due to pure luck, but ultimately the game boils down to how well you make decisions given the information you have and cards you were dealt. \u00a0\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s also a game I\u2019m unlikely to play again despite being hugely into it at various points of my life (I quit around four years ago). These are for the financial and TCG elements you mentioned, as well as all the horribly greedy and predatory decisions and practices from WotC that have increasingly gotten worse, and that they jumped the shark a while back when they started mixing Magic with other IPs.",
            "MTG is incredible. Now, for me personally, I think the game way too fast and powerful, now. Even in booster draft, which my favorite way to play, the game has become incredibly high power. Some people like that. I preferred the game in both constructed and limited when the power level was lower, but everyone's sweet spot on that is going to be different. Even so, the game, as a system, is undeniably great.",
            "I wish I could say I loved it. I'm not a huge fan of lands even if I think they provide interesting deckbuilding choices. Mechanically the design space is huge and MTG has done as much as possible to explore it which is an incredible feat. \nI just don't think it's that fun to play. It's a more interesting card game than most, especially other card games that try to fix its mana system, mostly because those games fail to create fun games, not because of their mana system. I'm a YGO player so my idea of fun is very different tbf, but Digimon is probably the best \"mana-like\" card game I've played since the decks themselves are fun to play.\n\nIronically, I think the card game with a card called \"Magnum Opus\" by Richard Garfield is his real magnum opus.",
            "I don't play standard or modern but commander. \n\nFor those who don't know the difference and haven't played magic:\nIn standard/modern you have a minimum of 60 cards and can have for copies of the same cards (excluding basic lands). These two formats only use the more recent sets with standard using the most recent and modern having a bit broader set base to build from.\n\nIn commander you choose a legendary creature that is \"your commander\" the mana cost of the commander restricts what colors you can use, the rest of the deck has to be 99 cards (so a 100 cards total, no more and no less) and you can't have two of the same cards except basic lands. This format is not restricted in the same way of what sets you can use but you can pretty much use any card that's ever been printed with a handfull of banned cards.\n(For people feeling inclined to bring this up, I exclude partner commanders and cards saying different, but this is the basics) \n\n\n\n\nSo with this in mind I really feel that the game is one of the better games out there. Two people can have the same commander but wildly different decks. There is almost no limit to what you can build and there is always one deck that can defeat another deck. There is no ultimate deck that can't be beat. And that in mind makes the gameplay pretty balanced in my opinion. \n\nThe mechanics has so much depth that playing standard and then playing commander is almost like playing two different kind of games. \n\n\n\nBut everything is ofc not always great. \nThere is ofc some unbalanced cards but my point is that in commander format many cards loose their super powers. They are strong but there are often many different ways of handling those cards. That said some cards are just broken still. \nThe new releases always contain some cards that are ridiculously strong, so strong that they are banned in standard and modern before release which is a strange practice to say the least. \nThis impacts the commander format but it does not break it. \nA cheap but we'll designed deck can still win a good amount of games against a 100$+ deck. So commander, due to its very wide selection of cards and deck designs, still balance itself out thanks to this. \n\n\nIt is a little bit like the boardgame Dune. You have these basic rules and them every faction breaks these rules in a broken way. But since every faction breaks the rules in broken ways the game balance itself out. \nIt is a bit the same in commander. \n\n\nThe most negative part about commander and magic in general is that you can get stuck in a loop wanting expensive strong cards and struggle with Fomo a lot since they sort of use that to get more sales. But gameplay mechanism I think it is pretty great.",

There's many card battles and it goes over the changes in meta in the competitive scene from the beginning. Explaining the various decks and how further editions banned/balanced cards.\n\nPersonally I really loved the game when it was more simple. I feel too many cards were overpowered and needed direct counters. And now it honestly degenerated for my taste. It used to be \"target creature gets +3/+3\" and  that was it now you need to read what feels like a space rocket manual printed on a card to understand its ability.\n\nI feel when a straightforward card battler gets to the point you need a magnifying lens to read the text because otherwise it won't fit on the card something has gone wrong\n\nGiven i haven't played it for almost 20 years, i gavr it up when i felt it was getting out of hand. so i can't say much of the current scene just my impression",

There\u2019s just so much fantastic card art. \u00a0The whole mini game of collecting art outside of the actual game makes you emotionally link to your cards and decks in a satisfying way.\n\nThe game has some issues in the learning curve being insane and the mana causing non-games. Those are extremely glaring downsides that limit who the game can be played with.

            "Richard Garfield original design is very different from the current one in terms of balance and power. Spells were overpower and creatures a joke for most of the early years for exampl; now that's not the case and there's a general power creep to force you to keep buying new cards. Garfield made a CCG for the thrill of getting a rare card from time to time; now the only \"sane\" option is to buy singles.\n\nI love MTG and it's a classic for a reason, but nowadays it can be separated from the hungry monster Hasbro is. Netrunner on the other hand, is the superior game from Garfield, and now is managed by the community with a non-profit profile. And designing wise is super interesting, completely asymmetrical but balanced.",
            "I think it's excellent. For some reason it's the TCG I always come back to.\n\nThe land/mana system looks clunky at first, and it causes mana screw. But it's actually brilliant. It allows you to either make a dependable 1 color dekc, or add as many colors as you'd like on your deck... if you feel confident you can draw the exact lands you need. It adds an element of risk/reward to deckbuilding. It makes things like deck manipulation important.\n\nMany other card games tried to fix this system and it always ends up less interesting. I've played Hearthstone for a long time. And in that game... well the palyer who drops the strongest cards on tempo often wins. Yeah, getting mana screwed feels bad, but losing because your opponent drew and palyed the perfect 1 drop, 2 drop, 3 drop and 4 drop also feels bad. It's also luck.",
            "I know it's enormously popular, but I find MtG's gameplay underwhelming, despite how gorgeous the artwork is.\n\nI guess if I'm playing a game where so much luck is present, I want it to be cooperative against the game\u2014or at least make it so one player can't suddenly do an obliterating amount of damage to the other.",

A competition modern deck is $500+ don\u2019t even look up legacy. \n\nAlso as a game, my rank order is:\n\n1. Cube drafts \n2. Sealed drafts \n3. EDH\n4. Modern \n\nEDH is really interesting and I love that so many people have a deck in their bag, but it suffers from major balance issues and a large game of EDH is dreadfully slow and boring.\n\nBasically I have loved magic for 20 years and it\u2019s always going to have a place but it\u2019s almost never as fun as a top board game. Overall I\u2019d give it like a 7/10 at this point.",
            "Commander (EDH), which is a casual format, is by far the best way to play Magic the Gathering currently.  I know this opinion is subjective, but more players are leaning towards Commander, because the product that releases nowadays, is mostly Commander pushed.\n\nThat being said, Commander has a ban list, but can use cards since the beginning of magic.  It's a little easier to get into, because it's a singleton format, so you don't need to seek multiples of cards.  It's also a deep format because of it's huge card pool.\n\nI have made more friends and had more fun playing Commander than any other MTG format.",

Rarely is the game truly balanced and reaction-based.. \n\nIf your deck relies on powerful, expensive spells but your opponent has a counter deck, too bad, you're probably gonna lose.\n\nIf your deck relies on many, many shitty creatures but your opponent has lots of spells for dealing with such a thing, too bad, you're probably gonna lose.\n\nIt just feels bad to get hard-countered like this simply by pure luck of your opponent having a build that specifically counters yours but is otherwise average.",

            "If the expectation is: \"Win in 4 turns or your deck is trash\", I want nothing to do with the thing.",
            "First of all, I do like the mana system.  I like ramping up from weaker spells you would play in the first few turns to stronger spells as the game progresses.  Outside of crazy combos, it is designed to keep games from running away early for one player.\n\nWhat I don't like is that every turn, you only get to draw one card.  I feel that it causes games to stall by the mid game.  When you build a deck, you typically have 40% of the cards be land or mana generating cards on average.  That means that a bit more than half of your cards are spell cards.  When you get to a point in the game where you are top decking, I just feel that with only 60% of the cards being spell cards, you can have too many turns where you don't draw anything worth playing too often.\n\nI personally think that players should draw 2 cards per turn.  Each turn, you play a land and play a spell.  That is the tempo you want each turn.  By the mid game, you can play more than one spell each turn.  Also, by drawing 2 cards per turn, there is less of a chance you get mana screwed early.  Right now for duals, the player who plays first skips his draw.  I think that if players draw 2 cards per turn, you can balance the card advantage better by having the player going first drawing only 1 card.  That way, players take turns having a one card advantage at any given point of the game.\n\nThere have been many games that came out since MtG was first released that are very similar.  I think some of them have some good ideas that would improve MtG.\n\nI played WoW:  TCG for a while.  This game is very similar to MtG.  One mechanic I love about this game is that any card can be played face down as a resource.  That way, you never get mana screwed.  I would have loved MtG to have a similar mechanic.  Play any card face down as a colourless/generic land card.  Being mana screwed is something that happens too often.  This one rule really helps minimise being mana screwed.\n\nI recently tried Star Wars Unlimited.  One thing that I loved about it is that player start off with the equivalent of 2 lands in play at the start of the game.  Then on the first turn, you play your third land.  I would love to see MtG have a similar rule as well.  Again, this helps minimise the chances of being mana screwed.  It would also help the tempo in the early game.  Maybe draw an opening hand of 9 cards.  Then lay 2 land down right away before the first turn.  You can play any card face down as a generic land.  This way, you could minimise or potentially eliminate the need to mulligan.\n\nAs for the power of cards, that has changed throughout MtG's history.  There are going to be cards that are too weak and those that are too strong.  As there are multiple different formats from limited to various different constructed formats, there are cards that are more geared to some formats than others.  There are also cards for different types of players as well.  There are certainly broken cards.  However, I feel that MtG does try to push things.  I appreciate that it is a difficult task to create cards and whole sets with different audiences in mind and keep everything balanced.  There are only so many development resources and they won't catch everything.  They have made mistakes, but I feel that overall, they do a pretty good job as is.\n\nMtG has been around for such a long time that I don't think that they could make significant changes to the rules.  As much as I would love 2 card draws per turn and being able to play any card as a generic land, I don't think they can make such rule changes.  I would love to try it sometime to see how it plays.",

Legends of Runeterra has the same problem, it rewards linear gameplans of who can turn their mana into the most tempo far too much. The spell mana system in that game is not a fix, because designers then proceeded to make spells stupidly overcosted.\n\nAnd also yes, there are significant benefits to using colored mana as an organic deckbuilding restriction instead of the mountains of uninspired designs and broken \"color\" identities we see in HS and LoR.",

            "Completely agree with this. Mana screw/flood definitely feels bad. But if it\u2019s happening to you a lot, it\u2019s almost definitely because your deck is designed suboptimally. The number of lands you put in your deck versus the mana curve of the cards you put in your deck is a deckbuilding decision that needs to be accounted for. \n\nAnd there is a risk/reward element there, too. Sometimes decks play fewer lands as a form of \u201cvirtual card advantage,\u201d since they\u2019ll draw a higher ratio of impactful cards versus lands, but those decks will usually have a lower mana curve so they need fewer lands to operate. And even then, they can be more susceptible to mana denial strategies than decks playing more lands. \n\nI play the Legacy format, and the kinds of lands you decide to play makes a huge difference too in terms of risk/reward. You can play lots of dual-producing lands that far more consistently allow you to meet the colour requirements of the cards you play, but those lands are way easier to disrupt and destroy than basic lands which only produce one colour. Mana denial strategies are viable partially because of the inherent variance in access to mana. I\u2019ve seen it suggested that using a separate mana deck would eliminate mana issues, but it would also remove a huge component of the strategy involved in the game, and make it much more difficult to attack opponents on the axis of mana production. \n\nTo each their own, though. I certainly have my issues with Magic from time to time, but mana screw isn\u2019t one of them. Biggest issue for me currently is that power creep is getting way out of hand in the last four years or so.",

Chess is pure memorization. Hidden information adds a tactical element.

For instance, you never get any games where you have to hold on until you draw your fifth land, or games where both players are having different kinds of mana issues. \n\nThis feels more to me like good variance arising from the mana system (which I acknowledge also produces bad-feeling variance sometimes), than it does Magic's design being warped by the mana system, but it's hard to know what the world looks like where Richard Garfield instead designed a game with Hearthstone's system.",

            "Magic being 1st had 2 major advantages for it that are really difficult for anyone else to dislodge.\n\n1) **You'll play a worse game that has players over a better game that you can't actually find a match for.** Simply put, if you want to get into a TCG, Magic just has players everywhere. This is a huge reason why WotC has focused on things like Friday Night Magic and generally pushes more content for casual (i.e. Commander) than competitive play. If people in your area have cards, you don't need to teach them, and shops are running events, you can actually enjoy the game. Being around forever gives them a huge advantage here. It's really hard to actually establish a foothold as a new head-to-head TCG.\n\nYou could argue that players could switch en-masse, but there needs to be some kind of catalyst other than just being a better product. We've observed this with social media now, where despite companies like Facebook and Twitter being reviled, nobody will leave the platform. And there's also another element keeping Magic players around...\n\n2) **People are pot committed.** Magic is exorbitantly expensive, and players treat it like a mini stock market with tons of \"investments\" in the form of cards. Magic players don't want Magic to die because their 1000s of dollars they've put into the game go up in smoke. As much as they might gripe or moan about mechanics, at the end of the day, they've sunk too much money in to go away now. Plus, the competitive formats are built to require you to constantly buy new cards to update your deck.\n\nThese 2 factors both play off of each other as well. Say a new TCG shows up, but you've already spent $1000 on Magic cards to build the decks you like. Not only is this a lot of cash, but it's also just fun to have more cards to play with. But then, when a new TCG comes along, do you really want to spend another few hundred to get into that game? You'll have less cards to play with, so fewer options of decks means most people will get bored faster. And with point 1, what if you spend that money and there's no events or things to give you opportunities to actually play? What if your friend ends up not liking it? What if the local scene dies? You're not likely to spend a lot of cash on a game that might not make it.\n\nThis is the big reason why most card games that are successful nowadays focus on cooperative/solo play. It's easier to get people to commit when they know they'll always be able to play.",

        "content": "There have been a few posts the last few days of people having negative experiences with Arcs. While of course it is perfectly okay to not like or even hate the game; in both instances the original poster played their first game with an expansion and then got frustrated when not knowing the rules or basic strategy. \n\nTo clarify, there are essentially 3 \u201cmodes\u201d that you can play Arcs in. **None of them are a training mode or a tutorial**. \n\n1) Base game Arcs\n\n2) Arcs + Leaders and Lore\n\n3) Blighted Reach Campaign Expansion \n\n\nBase game Arcs without Leaders and Lore is a complete game. You could very well play the game this way every time. This is not a tutorial, it is not a walkthrough, it is not a watered down version of the game. This version of the game is not asymmetrical. Everyone has the same rules and no one has any special powers or abilities. **This should be the way you play the first 1-3 times you play the game**. If you prefer a game that has less rules overhead and no asymmetry then you could always play this way. I don\u2019t know how this thought got out there that this is boring/watered-down/training version of the game. It\u2019s not. \n\nLeaders and Lore is an add on you can play with with the base game (there\u2019s some L&L cards in the base game and an additional expansion that adds more). As is stated in the rule book in big bold letters, **You should play and understand the base game before you add Leaders and Lore**. Leaders and Lore gives players special starting positions/pieces and special powers/abilities/perks. While some might look at the cards and think they don\u2019t add too much rule overhead and so start with this mode, L&L does add asymmetry that can make it much harder to know what to do or stop other players if you don\u2019t know the base game. **Even if you have played asymmetrical or heavy games before, don\u2019t start with this mode**. As stated above, this isn\u2019t the \u201cfull game\u201d mode. It\u2019s just additional asymmetry and variety that you can add if that is something you want.\n\nThe Blighted Reach Campaign expansion turns the base game into a 3 game mini campaign. **Do not play this expansion until you feel confident with the base game + Leaders and Lore**. Seriously, starting with the campaign is not going to be a fun experience. The campaign assumes you have mastered base game +leaders and lore and throws a bunch of wrenches and craziness at you. Again, you might assume that since you\u2019ve played heavy games before that the rules aren\u2019t too crazy, but to enjoy the campaign you really need to understand the strategy and nuances of the base game. There also seems to be this idea that Blighted Reach is the \u201cfull game\u201d and the base game doesn\u2019t stand on its own. This is not true, they are very different things.\n\nTl;dr:\n\nBase game: always start with this. Best continued play for players who want a tight / strategic game without asymmetry (think Pax Pamir) \n\nBase + Leaders and Lore: add it in when you know the base game if you want something with more variety and asymmetry (think Root)\n\nBlighted Reach: should only be played after fully grasping L&L. Play this if you want a branching mini campaign with crazy rules and swings. (Think Root and Oath mixed with more story handholding) ",

            "I really enjoyed the interconnectedness of the base games systems. The utilization of the rescources while they are at the same time important for scoring, was a quick realisation. The importance of control was a little bit lost in the first game.\n\nSadly the emotional rollercoaster, that Arcs is, was a little bit too much for the group that evening. It goes very fast from \"OH, YES!\" to \"OH, FUCK NO!\" and the opportunistic mindset one has to enact, adapting from round to round and board state to board state, wasn't everyones cup of tea.",
            "My favorite game is Twilight Imperium. I played my first game of Arcs using just the base game (and without breaking the rules like some other negative reviews have done).\n\nI am so glad I did. I love the game, but leaders+lore would have resulted in a much worse experience thanks to the asymmetry.\n\nI also love how Leder has created 3 experiences here that all play nicely. I can ease people in with the tight base game, get them excited to try leaders+lore, and then work folks up to doing a campaign. Unraveling the game is a genuinely nice experience because the game continues to surprise.",
            "I agree with OP\u2019s general sentiment, but I don\u2019t think Leaders and Lore is a necessary step to the campaign. Leaders and Lore is great way to add asymmetry to a one off game, but it doesn\u2019t really teach you anything you need to know about the game to step into the campaign.\n\nThe base game, with or without Leaders and Lore, is a complete experience in and of itself. I think a lot of people who haven\u2019t followed the game might view base Arcs as a lesser experience because you\u2019re not using all the stuff, which I suspect might be why some go straight to the campaign. As a completionist who\u2019s into very heavy games, I get it, but it\u2019s not the right approach here.",
            "Pssh ya right why would I listen to the game's designers? \n\nI know what I'm doing and th- wait what the fuck how does this part work? These rules are confusing I don't understand how these systems work together and this strategy seems broken after one play. \n\nShit game 0/10",

Having an easier to get into, but with still deep mechanics game like arcs is great. And the possibility to make it meatier for people who have the time and motivation to go deeper down the rabbit hole is great. Doesn\u2018t mean it makes base game redundant by any means. \n\nDefinitely going to play base game everytime a new player is there.",
            "I appreciate this post. Played my first (base only) game last night and had a blast. \n\nI was certainly glad that we didn\u2019t add in Lore and Leaders. There\u2019s so much to learn (not necessarily rules, but strategy and interactions of players and mechanics) that adding in faction asymmetry would have surely melted my feeble mind.",
            "I get and agree with the sentiment, everyone should probably follow the recommendations in the rulebook but this post feels a bit like gaslighting:\n\n>I don\u2019t know how this thought got out there that this is boring/watered-down/training version of the game.\n\nThe big selling pitch of the game during the Kickstarter when most people bought it was a limited campaign and Cole was clear this was his original vision of the game. They also said they found it works really well without it but one of the few early reviews, from Space Biff, was not exactly glowing. \n\nI mean base Arcs from what I understand is lacking in the titular arcs that the Blighted Reach adds. \n\nIt's pretty easy to see where this idea comes from, hopefully the fans appreciate that the game has developed alot since then and that includes the best way to get into the game but for so many people buying in, they bought it for what the Blighted Reach adds.",
            "Starting with the base game is probably a good idea. That being said, I started with Blighted Reach and absolutely loved it. Sure, I had no idea what good strategy was but doesn't change the fact that it was super fun.",
            "I\u2019ve only played the base game so far and I found myself enthralled by the interconnected systems. Definitely looking forward to putting it thru the paces and gradually adding more stuff to it.",
            "Makes total sense to me. I followed guidance and played vanilla arcs for our first game and thought the game was fascinating, where complexity wasn\u2019t from complicated actions, but more from the ramifications of your choices.",
            "I didn't even know this game existed, and now I want it so much!",
            "There are plenty of games where I prefer the base game, even if expansions are available.  Often expansions have a bad complexity:interesting decisions ratio for me.  I often prefer to just play different games than piling systems onto a game I already think is good.\n\nNot a universal rule, but I feel like there's often a \"more is more\" vibe in this hobby.  I'm of course also guilty of that; I backed Arcs for the full boat even knowing I usually don't crack the extra content from kickstarters.  I just add these KS exclusives to my \"investment portfolio\" shelf, kept in the shrink of course to preserve their value.",
            "As someone who is excited for Arcs, but hasn't done a tonne of digging, I have a question:\n\nI understand the proposition of Arcs is \"what if we started with identical factions and ended up with divergent asymmetrical factions?\" I understand this to be a major element of the blighted reach. Is this the proposition of the base game as well? If not, what _is_ the proposition of the base game?",
            "I wholeheartedly suggest jumping straight into Leaders & Lore.  Our first game (3 players) included someone new to heavier games in general and it both included L&L and went great.  I think you need at least one person who's actually read the rules ahead of time to MC, but that's our method regardless.\n\n---\n\n- Having that touch of asymmetry really livens up the game.\n- Having a character with narratively consistent abilities makes the stories better.\n- And, when in doubt or stuck in analysis paralysis, you can fall back on roleplaying as your character.  This is super helpful while everyone is still learning and winning isn't as important.\n\n---\n\nOf course, if you're less confident that your group can handle it, don't do it.  For us, we're primarily composed of experienced players and a few hobbyist designers; our time is limited, and playing 3 games of base arcs before playing a few games of leaders and lore before playing the campaign might mean we don't get to the campaign for months.  so we explicitly chose to accelerate, knowing the risks.  ymmv.\n\n---\n\ntl;dr the ***context*** that leaders and lore adds is better to have than not.  anecdote / opinion.",
            "I didn't get frustrated with basic rules or strategies. Those were assumptions. I won.\n\n\nAnd did not enjoy the experience.\u00a0\n\n\nDownvotes away. But save the explanations on why I didn't enjoy my experience to yourself. You'll just assume anyway.\u00a0\n\n\nI won't reply further. You can up vote all the mocking comments to your hearts content like last time.\u00a0",
            "I feel like the designers should have picked one mode and made it the game instead of setting players up to fail.",
            "Was the base game released before the expansion? If not I can see where the confusion comes from. Releasing a game for the first time with an \"expansion\" included is just a semi-scummy sales tactic, because that's not really what \"expansion\" means, and that's bound to lead to misunderstandings. \n\nThis whole thing is a mess of bad communication born out of marketing decisions rather than design decisions.",
            "Yeah I'm a big fan of the game but there are a few elements that will definitely turn off players:\n\n- Demandingly tactical. Your hand impacts the boardstate which then informs your hand management. You must be able to pivot and adapt constantly and this will absolutely *wreck* those players with deep AP\n\n- For a designer known for mean games, Arcs legitimately could be Cole's most *aggressive* title. Several elements add to this but most especially the Raid mechanism. People that can't stand their stuff getting messed with will be upset. \n\n- The map design, component limits and setup encourage vulnerability. This means players can't turtle and defend their prized possessions, especially since the player-driven scoring will incentivize declaring ambitions away from opponent's strengths. That runs counter to typical \"space opera\" tropes and will cause discomfort.",
            "Our first game switched very quickly from board area control to resource control to court control from round to round based on the ambitions. It was wild.",

            "Right?\n\nI've played Twilight Imperium exactly twice (3rd edition, this was pre-4).\n\nI found it just too big a game to learn properly. It's like 8 to 12 hours each time, so if you want to experiment and learn what works and what doesn't, that's a huge investment. And then you play like twice a year because of having to block off an entire day, and don't remember any of the specifics like techs or action cards. It's just so much, the learning curve is so steep, and getting through that learning curve is a much bigger time investment than I want to make.\n\nArcs... Oh hey, you can play the basic game in 2 hours and get comfortable with the main mechanics and learn the main set of cards with no real investment. You can play on a weeknight, you can take it to random meetups, you can play it with anyone. Like if TI had a version where all you did was build ships and fight.\n\nAnd then once you're comfortable you add in stuff that makes the game more varied. And then you can jump into the campaign and spend those 10 hours and *know what you're doing from the start*. It makes the barrier to entry so much lower, it's great.\n\nAnd then the way you can split that 10 hour game up into pieces too. It's clearly a game by a TI lover who respects your time and busy life as an adult",
            "I think people should really try to understand that base Arcs and Blighted Reach Campaign are essentially two totally different games, despite sharing the same core rule set.\n\nBase Arcs is immediately confrontational and opportunistic, and with experienced players very snappy.\n\nBlighted Reach Arcs features a lot of indirect conflict and competition and a lot of politicking. I've witnessed some games of Blighted Reach Arcs start off almost as a semi-cooperative. Over the course of the game it may escalate into full-blown conflict, but it kind of depends. It can also be snappy, but can also slow down as the players evaluate which paths to go down.",

Leaders and Lore is great way to add asymmetry to a one off game, but it doesn\u2019t really teach you anything you need to know about the game to step into the campaign.\n\nI fully agree with this.\n\nI played the base game with some friends a couple of times and we *were* going to do leaders and lore next until I realised all the extra overhead in the campaign came from campaign specific stuff which L+L didn't have at all. So I guess if you're not used to asymmetric games or relatively complex games at all it's a good stepping stone, but not necessary at all.",
            "I agree. I don\u2019t dislike L&L and I am glad it exists but my preference after 6 plays of various configurations is \n\nCampaign > Base > L&L. \n\nL&L feels like a quarter step towards the campaign and to me makes the player agency feel more prescriptive without the narrative payoff of the campaign.",
            "It's a shame that people can't just say \"oh wow, yeah we messed up, we'll have to try it again without all the expansions\". But instead they INSIST that the way they played was correct and that the entire world is wrong, even the designer.",
            "Yeah, it\u2019s kind of bonkers that people would just drop in 175% of the game\u2019s content and then act butthurt when there are \u201ctoo many rules\u201d. Like what were you expecting?",

This is a learning game\".\n\nIt always happens this way, and it never happens when everyone has played their faction. It's simply the nature of the game. \n\nYou can start with Blighted Reach, but the whole 3-6 hour campaign is going to be like that first game if Root of you're new to the game.",
            "Honestly it's a terrible terrible idea to start with the campaign. The base game is sooo tactical and every move is too full of subtle consequences that OP is right here you need to MASTER the base game before jumping into the campaign. \n\nI almost think Leder games could've waited 3 extra months to ship the campaign box. to low-key force payers to play the base game, see that it's amazingly deep by itself, and then ship the campaign (I know twice the shipping cost was never gonna happen, but some people are just too thick to understand)",
            "Anyone who does this gives up the privilege of writing a negative review after one play.",
            "It cost that much more, because it adds that much more. Think of it as 2 separate games, you have Arcs, and you have the Blighted Reach Campaign. The blighted reach campaign just happens to require the base game to play.",
            "You get material for a 3 game campaign where everyone gets a \"fate\" at the start that gives them asymmetric powers and may alter base game rules. It also adds neutral player pieces in the form of neutral cities and an NPC antagonist force as well as \"imperial\" ships that can be used if you remain a member of the empire, but then you face a resource tax.\n\nEach starting fate can progress through each game, deepening the rules changes and asymetry, or you can \"multiclass\" into a fate that can only begin in the second game and has more dramatic effects. You also keep your original fate. In game 3, you make a similar choice with a third set of fates that only enter in game 3.\n\nThe box also comes with an involved storage solution so you can save your progress more easily and also store all the base game components.",
            "I think the expansion costing twice as much as the base game is completely valid honestly. It has a TON of content. The box is like 3 times the size of the Oath box. \n\nAs for what you\u2019re missing: honestly it\u2019s just a very different game than the base game, as someone else said in this thread, it\u2019s almost a different game completely. The base game is a tight, strategic, zero sum, very mean game. It\u2019s a fantastic game just by itself and you\u2019ll get as much value of it as getting Root or Pax Pamir or something.\n\nThe expansion is a whole different experience entirely. It turns it into a 3 game mini campaign with roles, branching stories, free cities, political summits, blight reaching across the board, flagships, etc. The campaign is amazing and I think if you like the base game and have a group to play with consistently it\u2019s 100% worth the money. But I think it\u2019s also valid to stick with just the base game",
            "The blighted reach box is double the size of the base game.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 There's all these roles that people can choose, which can change in game 2 and 3.\u00a0 So to make a game that can accommodate entirely different role switching needs to be fairly robust in handling all these rule breakers.\u00a0 Every role comes with their own stack of cards and usually some tokens.\u00a0 There's pieces for the old imperial fleet, blight, and player flagships and board (if the chosen role gets one).\u00a0 In addition, the court cards are switched as well.\u00a0 That expansion box can hold all these components PLUS the base game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is why the expansion costs so much more.\u00a0 It's not just adding 2 new rulesets, player pieces, and a few overlays like most expansions.\u00a0 It's almost an entirely new game per role that is chosen.\u00a0 I don't think it's like different root factions, but there's enough variability and openess to the roles that make the game more varied than Root and all the expansions combined.\u00a0 That's pretty wild.\u00a0 And they didn't use as many components as they could have meaning it's pretty streamlined for the most part.\u00a0",
            "It's like buying Pandemic and then later buying Pandemic Legacy, but you got to use all the components from your original base Pandemic game in the Legacy version. Also, the Legacy campaign is shorter and infinitely replayable with lots of variety.\n\nI was shocked when the two boxes came and the Blighted Reach was so much bigger then the base game, until I opened them up and realized that's because the base game just fits inside the Blighted Reach box and you can throw the base one away (unless you want to hang onto it for bringing just the base game places).",

Sure if you have been following the game since before the kickstarter opened then you might think that but most people will not know that. \n\nAs for the original intention for them to be one game, yes you are correct, that was Cole Wherle\u2019s intention years ago. But for a LONG time that has not been the intention of the game, the base game is a full game by itself. Space Biffs review of the finished base game is very positive.",

While this seems like nothing it has major consequences : suddenly player B didn't rule that planet anymore, couldn't tax player C's planet, therefor couldn't take a captive, and couldn't tie for the tyrant ambition. Player won that ambition with just that move. with was brilliant cause everyone expected player A to try to influence and secure to gain more captives, but there were other ways to accomplish the same goals.\n\n  \nWith the campaign elements I feel like the game will be overwhelming if you don't already understand perfectly how to navigate the base system and position yourself to succeed.",
            ">Sure, I had no idea what good strategy\n\nYou have to all be the kind of people who are OK with that (personally I love games like that). But some people just aren't capable (or willing).",
            "The main concern here is you're going to be dealing with so much detail and complexity from the Campaign that you might miss learning the subtleties of the card action system. The timing of when to surpass or seize, the effects of declaring an ambition, the tactics of movement on the map, and the variability of the dice types are all a bit *weird* out of the box for a lot of players and take getting used to.",
            "It\u2019s a great game! Would highly recommend!",
            "For sure, I find that many or even *most* expansions that add mechanisms and extra Stuff don't actually make the game better. Rather, they take a perfectly nice streamlined elegant game and add Faff. Great now you have a corner board to set up, three more piles of components to sort out, and each round you have to heat your house, clear bogs and forests off your land, and raise horses *without any extra actions* in a game that was already tight.\n\nI'm a big fan of pure content expansions, like Root's that just add different factions to plug in, or Imperial Assault's that just add new missions, heroes, and enemies.\n\nBlighted Reach is if anything a \"here is a new game with the same base rules\" expansion. Closest I can think of is Cyclades Titans. Really kind of gives you a choice of which game you want to play.\n\nAnd hey on the bright side since you backed it, you got the $100 expansion for $40, so unlike most of those \"investment\" boxes, this one will pay off! Your wife can take her boyfriend out for a couple drinks from the profits.",
            "The base game is a very fun area/resource control game with variable player-set objectives, an interesting action selection system indebted to trick-taking, and a fairly quick playtime when you know what you are doing.\u00a0",
            ">I understand the proposition of Arcs is \"what if we started with identical factions and ended up with divergent asymmetrical factions?\" I understand this to be a major element of the blighted reach.\n\nThis isn't the case.\n\nFrom the start of the blighted reach you have asymmetrical factions with competeing objectives but also the same overall goal.\n\nThe winner of the campaign will probably be the person with the most power (VP) after 3 Acts (games). However, each of you has a \"fate\" which js basically your character. That character has powers and goals, but achieving those goals only let's you stay as that character on the next game.\n\nThere is come cross over between these two because you lose power at the end of the Act depending on how far you were from achieving your fate, but largely speaking you can fail your fate goal twice and still have a good chance to win the last Act and win the entire campaign. I know this because it's exactly what happened to me in my first play through!\n\nArguably the game gets \"more\" asymmetrical as you continue because the fates introduce wilder and wilder goals and rules, but the game starts pretty asymmetrical.\n\nBase Arcs is totally symmetrical with everyone doing the same thing, the only difference being the resources on the planets you started on.\n\nLeaders and Lore adds asymmetry to an extent because you all have different powers/abilities, but ultimately you share the same possible 5 goals.",
            "I would say the main conceit of the base game is: take a fairly straightforward area control game then  have the action selection be done by a trick taking like card actions. I find it super interesting as in a normal game you have this set of actions and you just decide which ones are best in any scenario. But in Arcs you might not have those cards in your hand so you have to pivot your strategy to something else for this round. Or you might want to be aggressive and attack people but if you lead with an aggressive suit then everyone else is likely to also have more actions to attack. It\u2019s a really interesting dynamic that I haven\u2019t seen in other games. \n\nIt\u2019s also fairly unique that the point conditions are different each round and chosen by players so it\u2019s not like you can just decide \u201cI\u2019m going to be the militant player all game today\u201d. Your strategy has to be flexible and be able to change each round",
            "I gotta second this opinion. Despite what most of the people here have said, there is certainly a case to be made to start with L&L, or at least just a Leader. Role-playing aside, starting with a Leader gives you a strategic direction, as opposed to having to figure one out from scratch. And most of the Leaders aren\u2019t exactly rocket science\u2014they\u2019re usually things like collecting extra dice, free repairs, bonus resources when taxing, etc. Basically, your Leader ability tells you whether to lean into combat, economy, or court. And if you do draw one of the few more complex Leaders, who cares? Let them draw a new one, it\u2019s a learning game. We did L&L in our first game, but rather than bogging things down with the full draft, we did a simple Draw 2 Pick 1. No point in drafting when we barely knew the game and had no metagame to speak of. Everyone had a couple different options as far as complexity, it gave everyone some strategic direction, and it was quick. was perfect.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s group dependent. Without L&L, you have a few less rules to consider, but the strategic space is much more vast and you have a lot more responsibility to figure it out and carve out a niche yourself without any initial direction other than the hand you drew. You almost need a *deeper* understanding of the system to be effective, because you don\u2019t have a Leader card saying \u201cyou\u2019re extra good at x-strategy, but bad at y-strategy\u201d. But for some groups, having one less thing each to think about is worth that cost.\n\nTl;dr, here\u2019s what I would suggest:\n\n-If your group wants the absolute lowest rules overhead possible, and don\u2019t mind a wide strategic sandbox where you have many angles to consider and valuate, play without L&L. This is also the rulebook suggested way to start, and they\u2019re known for exhaustively playtesting, so it\u2019s a safe bet.\n\n-If your group wants to have a general strategic direction to get you started, and doesn\u2019t mind a tiny bit more rules overhead, start with a Leader. If your group is already savvy with Cole\u2019s games or studied up, also start with a Lore.\n\nJust my two cents. I definitely understand why they suggest starting without L&L, but I was very happy to have some direction in such a robust system as Arcs.",

I did not enjoy the base game that much either. Just not the game for me I guess.",
            "Fair enough, I could see that being a fair criticism. \n\nHowever, a couple counter points: \n\n1) it\u2019s not really setting players up to fail. The rule book is very clear to learn the base game before playing Leaders and Lore or Blighted Reach. Really my post is kind of self explanatory if you read the rule book but apparently some people are just ignoring that suggestion which is why I made this post\n\n2) it really is just more content and choice for players. If you had to play with Leaders and Lore than it would be a much more complicated teach and players who don\u2019t like asymmetry wouldn\u2019t like the game. There\u2019s a few posters in this thread who say they prefer the game without Leaders and Lore. So making it separate just gives players a choice.  Same thing with the expansion, if you only had the expansion game, the game would be $100+ more expensive and you\u2019d have to play a mini campaign. For people who just wanted a quick 90 minute game or don\u2019t play often with the same group, they\u2019d no longer have that option",
            "They released at the same time. Tbh I don\u2019t really see how it\u2019s bad communication, they are very clear everywhere that the campaign is more complicated and should only be played after learning the base game. (And to be honest, this is true of pretty much every game with an expansion, I\u2019m struggling to think of any game where it would be a good idea to add an expansion before learning the base game.)\n\nAs for why they are sold like this: Originally the idea for the game was that it would only be the campaign, that would be the whole game. But throughout development they realized 2 things: 1) the campaign became way bigger than expected and they\u2019d have to sell the game for $140  if everything was together which would be very prohibitive 2) the game had a lot of depth and strategy just as a base game and could stand alone without the story elements",
            "Yep, it was pretty brutal. As said, with a better utilisation of the control mechanic one or the other catastrophe could have been delayed or lessened, but it was soul crushing nontheless. Especially after one players nearly entire fleet got wiped and there was no warlord claimed. They had to play one and a half chapters with basically no ships... \n\nI mean, Root is already pretty mean but Arcs definitely is on a whole new level.",
            ">For a designer known for mean games, Arcs legitimately could be Cole's most aggressive title.\n\n100% agree with this, though I suppose in some respects JoCo will always be top line aggressive because of the real world subject matter.\n\nArcs is constant swingy pressure all over the place and if you have difficulty pivoting (heh) when your plans go sideways you might struggle a bit (or a lot).",
            "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s counter to space opera tropes, I think it\u2019s the most true to it. It\u2019s counter to 4X tropes, but Arcs is not a 4X game even though most space opera games are 4X.\n\nDune starts with the Harkonnen betrayal. Star Wars starts with the destruction of Alderaan. Most great space opera stories start with early aggression, but that core tenet of the fiction is lost in a lot of turtle durdle board games.",
            "It's a subtle shift but I'd argue not. In Root your scoring capacity is almost entirely dictated by actions during your turn, with seat binding playing a big role. \n\nIn Arcs actions are diffused across rounds and everyone shares the same types of actions. Scoring also occurs simultaneously for everyone, with high potential for massive swing rounds (via city bonuses). So I'd posit it's probably more advantageous to push your scoring agendas versus necessarily targeting the apparent leader.",
            "Since it's a game that ends when a player reaches a certain amount of points, in 3-4 player games there will often be a 'stop the leader from scoring' approach.\n\nDue to the scoring conditions, especially if you're just shooting for 2nd place, being rather simple, and the uncertainty of what's possible because of the card-action mechanic, it can be quite hard to completely and reliably shut someone out of scoring.",
            "Personally I don't find the two comparable at all. I love TI for the cold war negotiation it delivers. Arcs has none of that AFAIK.",
            "Absolutely. I really liked how, in my first Campaign with 2-players, we each basically went different directions around the core, fighting Blight and accomplishing our Fate goals while trying to get the edge on Ambitions when we could, and at the end realized, as we met on the opposite side of the galaxy with nearly all the Blight gone, that we never fired a single shot at each other.\n\nThat changed in the 2nd and 3rd games, but a game like that would have been hard to pull off in base Arcs because of the lack of Imperial ships locking you out of Rival aggression, and Blight/Free Cities not being around to give you targets of combat/taxing.",
            "It is important to be critical, but to posit that an extremely reputable designer like Leder Games hasn't relentlessly playtested their game and it's getting released wildly imbalanced is brazen ignorance. \n\nI'm all for negative reviews but yeah if it's starts from a place of \"I know better than the designer how this should work,\" you've lost my attention.",

            "There's definitely a lot of \"I know better\" type people that get into board games.  The people who try to put everything in the game at once despite the game making it clear to add it gradually are the same people that will start proposing house rules after 2 plays.",
            "I've played one 2p game since I got mine, there was so much going on without leaders and lore cards that we'll probably do a couple more bone stock games to figure out strategies before adding them in, then it's going to be a few games with it before trying blighted reach.",

            "Yeah Arcs is in a way highlighting a problem of the crowdfunding model - you get the whole game, expansions and all, at once, and there's a temptation to try to dive into all of it immediately\n\nTraditional retail releases you get the base game, and it does well, so they make an expansion for it, and most of the audience has had time with the base game by necessity. Even Root, the Kickstarter came with one small faction expansion. Delivering it as it is now, with six expansion factions, two extra maps, a second deck, and hirelings would prompt some similar overwhelmed responses.\n\nWhen a Kickstarter arrives with expansion boxes larger than the base game, it's very easy to bite off too much at once. You have to make a conscious decision to just open the base box and leave the rest on the shelf for a bit.",
            "To add to this, don't feel like you are missing out, it is very different. If you really enjoy the base gameplay of Arcs and you want the campaign feel, then get the Blighted Reach campaign, but you absolutely are not missing out.",
            "Might be a dumb question but how well can you access just the base game content if its all in the big box? Does it all mix together?",
            "I agree but everyone playing the game currently either purchased or have a friend who purchased it during the Kickstarter well before it evolved into what it is now. I don't blame them for wanting to get into one of the central hooks as quickly as possible, even if it is a bad idea to dive right into. \n\nIt's just one of the quirks of crowdfunding, the heaviest marketing push is for an unfinished project.",
            "Yes and no. The pitch in the first couple of designer diaries was very much that Arcs was a micro campaign game, original split over 1, 2, or 3 sessions. The last designer diary is industrial cause he says: \n\n> For the vast majority of folks reading this, the fact that Arcs will sometimes be played as primarily a single-session game will be largely incidental. I suspect you\u2019ll want to get the game with its campaign mode. When it arrives, you\u2019ll stack everything together in essentially one box. After getting your bearings over a few one-offs, you\u2019ll probably mostly play the campaign game. If you were the only folks we were making this game for, we\u2019d probably bundle everything together.\n\nSo it's clear he already meant the single session to help people learn the game but he knew the most exciting part was the campaign for the group that was very actively following the game and most likely to Kickstarter it.",

There are some groups who are fine with diving headlong into a game like that and being fine if they lose because they were learning strategy as they went and missed opportunities to score/stop others from scoring.

Hell, it\u2019s probably more common than not for Kickstarter games to release with an expansion.\n\nDo you really not see it? Do I really have to spell this out? OK.\n\nYes, Kickstarter games are notorious for using these kinds of shitty sales tactics. This comparison is decidedly not doing your point any favors.",
            "Ah, makes sense!",

            "They didn\u2019t chop up the game. The original\nIdea by the designer was it to be together. But since the start of Kickstarter it was always two separate things, it was never marketed as one game. It\u2019s almost like things change in development. To cite one of the biggest games ever, Seafarers was originally supposed to be part of base Catan but was taken out when they realized it would be too expensive and too complicated for the base game. \n\nI like how you just ignored that the price is now the same or even cheaper than it would have been together. TIL that giving people choice is shady business decision! You should teach a business class! Let\u2019s force people to pay $140-160 for a campaign that they might not have the group to play it with, instead of providing a base game that\u2019s easy to get to the table and an optional purchase of a campaign for the same price!",
            "The ambition tension is fantastic. Sometimes you have a lot of trophies or captions so you want to score, but sitting on those is good too, so you don\u2019t.\n\nSometimes you don\u2019t have any trophies or captives so you don\u2019t want to score, but you need to get them back, so you do.\n\nAnd that is axis is great in its own, but then you cross it with \u201cwhy\u201d?"
