Despite actively job hunting for four months, I haven't landed any DS or ML offers. I received an offer from a top 5 CS school in the EU for a 1-year MS AI program.

I found bioinformatics a bit boring so I shifted to machine learning instead. \nI started off with simple python coding then learning about machine learning algorithms using YouTube videos and online courses and I also studied about different statistical concepts used. Then I learnt a little SQL and I ended up getting two internships - one industrial and one for a research project. I learnt a lot more during these internships with real life projects. \n\nI applied for several jobs related to data analytics and data science after this but all ended up rejecting me or not replying. I don't understand what I am doing wrong. Is it my degree? Is it my resume? Is it my lack of knowledge?

Mainly with python np/pandas, have done with R and SAS in past.\n\nMore and more finding myself in situations where rather than go to the \"true\" developers, it's easier for both the business (and myself) to just write up a script to solve the immediate need.

            "# Thoughts about pre-interview Data science challenge? \n\n  \nHi - This has been a trend for long time, but I have seen that many companies ask you do some data science project on their data and return with multiple artifacts. They absolutely don't give any feedback and in my experience it definitely takes more than 5-10 hours to make a perfect notebook and other deliverables. Given that we want the opportunity to work, I appear for it, but it sounds really ridiculous that they reject without any feedback.\n\nWhat are you thoughts about it? How do you deal with such situations? How to pass these tests?",

I am currently working full time as a lab technician, and frequently work 9-10 hours because of the massive workloads they keep dumping on me. I'm really struggling to keep up with my studies while working full time with the occasional overtime, and I'm often so tired at the end of the day that I feel unmotivated to study and I'm in danger of falling behind. I am applying for remote data entry jobs, because I think they'd be easier to balance with my school work. Should I stay at my lab tech job so that I have something current (but unrelated to data science) to put on my resume, or quit since it's eating up all of my time to study my master's?

            "Hey! wondering if anyone could give me a clear direction of how to go about studying Python & entering the field of Data Analysis. What courses, subjects etc should I brush up on along side learning? I have a Marketing degree so I have experience with statistics, SPSS, data analytics etc but i graduated 3 years ago and went into management instead so I definitely forgot a lot of what I learned on what I learned on coding side. \n\nIf you're wondering why now, I am going through a quat-life crisis (F, 25) and after spending the last few years pursuing a corporate career in digital marketing/content strategy & dance, I'm really re-evaluating what I want to do. I've always been naturally pulled to learning and understanding the 'hows' of things existing and thats what always pushed me to learn. I thought my self how to forex trade for fun and literally only stopped because i learned all I wanted to learn which was how to read the graphs, how to predict, bears and bulls, what it meant to buy or sell etc. In university, one of my if not the highest grade I got was in SPSS and web design using DreamWeaver, my first introduction to coding and I loved it so much. I've started a course on LinkedIn and am looking into a course online too but I just want some direction from those already in it. Thanks in advance x",

I've thought of ways I could maybe implement SQL in this, by either storing it into a DB using SQL, or cleaning most of it using SQLalchemy then doing the rest in python, however I feel as though overcomplicating it more than it needs to be will instead have a negative impact.

I don't doubt your familiarity with them, but make sure you can answer most questions that an interviewer would ask you about ANY of the technology you listed.\n\n4) I would take off the work permit from your resume. Just answer that on the online application/when a recruiter is doing the phone screen. There is a chance that some companies are filtering you out when they see that. It's not right, but companies are not always ethical.\n\n5) You don't have to put when you started college on a resume.

If I tell myself \u201cI\u2019m going to work on this for x amount of time\u201d then it helps me stay focused - after that I can take a short break.

After doing that a lot, nerding simply became synonymous with being an escape.  Now as an adult, there is always this floaty (in the bad way) region of time where I no longer feel the knee-jerk pull of nerding to drown out the trauma, but don't quite yet feel the softer and more sincere pull of simply enjoying using my mind in fun ways.\n\nInternally, I reduced this to a mental of model however deeply triggered I am as being the steepness of my own emotional error landscape.  Softening that landscape breaks all of my old features.  Most easily, I could re-trauma myself to give life texture again.

            "I'll look into that for sure, thanks. I've never specifically asked my doc about it, but it's worth asking for sure. Thank you!",
            "Yeah, I get that. I am struggling with momentum lately. Just need to keep going and not go back to Reddit. Haha. Good luck!",
            "Do you actually get to see your projects to completion? That\u2019s what\u2019s killing me. I haven\u2019t actually accomplished anything in a couple years now. \n\nI\u2019m not just here for a check. I\u2019m a good engineer. My projects get killed and I get swirled around. Makes me lose interest.",
            "lol same",
            ":)  \nI'll give that book a look!",
            "Ive got pretty bad ADHD. It manifests badly in the form of procrastination on big projects, so I understand the struggle.\n\nThe best thing I've ever been asked when facing a seemingly insurmountable task is, how do you eat an elephant?\n\nThe answer is one bite at a time.\n\nTry to break your project down into smaller, bite-sized chunks. I start with easy tasks first to get some momentum and I eventually get to a point where I'm fixated on the problem and won't stop working even when I'm supposed to.",
            "I don't know enough about it all to use the right words (PMs please correct me!), but my team uses agile 2 week sprints. I was suuuper worried about this at first, but now I really like having the work for 2 weeks planned out and I can see down the road what the backlog has in store. It has actually been great for my work anxiety even though -ironically- I had a lot of anxiety when our team adapted to jira/agile/sprints.\n\nbut, yeah, breaking a project in to smaller tickets where each ticket has a weight, priority, and (something resembling?) a deadline. Has really actually helped my sanity.",
            "Going back into an office for a few days a week was great for me. Honestly, the only reason I would recommend hybrid over full remote is this. \n\nOne of the tricks I have found is taking one of my ambitious junior people who wants to climb the technical ladder, and essentially pair coding through some of the higher end technical work I had to do. Our code quality improved significantly too, when we started doing that.",
            "I think they are responding to the bits where you are having trouble with focus, but if it is a recent thing only then it seems unlikely that you were ADHD all along.",
            ">Just need to keep going and not go back to Reddit.\n\nI know I need to keep my phone out of my office but I have been failing at that lmao. That's definitely going to be a goal for me!\n\n>Good luck!\n\nThanks and back at ya!",
            "Lol, feels like I wrote this comment myself. Sucks because other potential employers seem to judge you on what you've done. I haven't tried telling them I can't finish projects for reasons outside of my control but I imagine that doesn't come across well.",
            "Damn I'm sorry you're in that position. I would be crushed. \n\nI am very lucky in that I am in charge of the data science portion for one of our most important products, I do indeed get to see it used successfully in production.\n\nFeel free to PM me your resume and interests. I can't guarantee we have any open positions for you at the moment, but I'll still take a look",
            "That's actually exactly the same format and schedule we recently moved to. I didn't think it would be helpful so I haven't given my full effort to following the agile and Jira stuff. It's worth a shot! Thanks for your perspective",
            "Pair coding is a cool idea. Can you give me a cliff notes description of your process? I don't want to take up too much of your time",
            "Agreed but I figured it's worth inquiring about",
            "\u201cAre you familiar with X?\u201d Let\u2019s go build this feature/do this model fitting/etc together. I\u2019ll sit basically next to you/over your shoulder, and we\u2019ll talk through it as we go. When you get to the usual trouble/niche technical points, I provide the inputs/expertise on what the tradeoff is, and talk through some of the more nuanced strategies. We make a decision, and keep moving on."
