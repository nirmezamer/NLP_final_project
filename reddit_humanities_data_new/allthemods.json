There is a lot missing, and more mods will be added over time. The pack is only for people who want to test out early 1.21 mods on Neoforge. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nATM9/NF is still in active development and will be getting updates about once a month. \n\nATM9 TTS is also in active development.\n\nGravitas 2 is also an option if you want to try something new.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TLDR:** If you want to play a long term pack with friends and have a good time play ATM9/NF/TTS/G2. If you want to help beta test and watch the pack grow from the beginning play ATM10 once it comes out.",

Every post I've ever read on here about the update of Draconic Evolution to 1.21 is people hoping it won't be added to packs, especially this one..\nIs it worth taking a poll to check the temperature before too much work is done, or having an optional script to add quests and progression if a player manually adds it like with E2E and adding RS?",

I only have one or two seeds of everything (my MA farm is the hypercube; the space is precious) so speeding that up can be beneficial.",

So I use it for the stuff you need a royal fuckload of, like nether stars, and try to find other generation for other resources. I just set up a few stone work factories to get myself some concrete and some sand products. Gonna get started on making my actual base now that concretes in the works."

            "There\u2019s nothing really difficult about the ATM star. You either know the mods or you don\u2019t. You can make a star in 40 hours, or you can enjoy building and making factories and automating the Greg star for 500 hours.",
            "Depends. Are you solo or in a group. Do you count offline time while the quarry was mining for resources, or the autocrafters doing their thing. Will you use Greg... \n\nIf you're looking to play it and want to know how long it takes, then chances are, you will likely lose the motivation to finish it before reaching the star. But every small step towards it will still be fun nonetheless.\n\nImho 200 hours is slow, but my endgame playtime mostly consisted of joining the server once in a while to set-up autocrafting of the next thing. While my MA farm and quarry were doing their thing 24/7",
            "It really depends on how you play and what you do in your world. It took me around 127 hours to complete the star, but I also did other things like build a decent base and make op armor and weapons. However I could easily see myself doing a play-through for much longer.",
            "It depends on how you want to handle your star-making. I set out from the beginning to build a nice area for each of the mods that were required for parts of the star, and use that space to not only make the parts, but automate them (as much as possible). Even for things like Mj\u00f6llnir that can\u2019t easily be entirely automated, I tried to make it as easy as possible to make 18 of them in quick succession (9 for each block, to convert a bee and for its flower).\n\nIt took me around 250 hours for my first star, but I ended up with a base I was proud of, even if it wasn\u2019t actually that impressive. Plus, because I focused on bulk crafting since the beginning, I had enough stars to make the starry bee and have it produce more stars, less than an hour after I crafted my first star. That set me up with infinite energy and the like, plus with all the other automated resources, making things for the Greg star become a lot easier. I\u2019m not done with that yet, but I\u2019m at least 350 hours in now and in the insane voltage age (ah, chemical reactors\u2026).\n\nBut like another comment said, AlfredGG (a pack/quest dev) did it much faster, not bothering to automate things, using better/more time-efficient strategies, and focusing on one star rather than 18 (which is quite a large difference). If only all of my stinky classes weren\u2019t so demanding, heh. I\u2019ll get the degree eventually, maybe then I\u2019ll have time for the Greg star, in ATM 11 or something. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
