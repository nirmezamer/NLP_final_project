            "Thinking of playing a Sea Druid when my group does Dungeon of the Mad Mage, and the DM said I could use the subclass with the 2014 rules and do Ye Olde Tempest Cleric multiclass for Wis-based max Lightning and Thunder damage. Taking Metamagic Adept for Transmuted Spell Metamagic is a must, but what other Metamagic should I take? Twinned Spell? Extended Spell for 40d6 healing from Aura of Vitality outside of combat?",

            "Druids have a surprising lack of elemental damage spells, so transmuted spell is a good choice! I'd skip twinned b'c you'll only have enough sorcery points for lvl1-2 spells. I normally don't like extended spell, but druids have so many concentration spells it could work out well to extend heals or buffs. Even an aoe might worthwhile if you're powering through a dungeon and clear 2-3 rooms in succession with a two-minute moonbeam. Otherwise subtle spell is always a good option in RP situations or if you might get counterspelled.",

            "DM also said I could have Storm Sphere which could also be good for Extended Spell in a prolonged fight, though unlike Moonbeam I couldn't move it.\n\nMulticlas split would be Druid 18/Cleric 2, I don't want it to be super complicated. I know I'm gonna take Elemental Adept (Lightning) as well, since between that and transmuting to Thunder, I should be able to max damage against basically any creature in there (unless there's something immune to lightning and resistant/immune to Thunder). War Caster would also be good, although my group is generally inconsistent in how often we remember to call for/make our concentration saves. Aside from those 3 feats, idk what else I'd take",

I also use the drake to deter attacks against my allies. \n\nOut of combat, I\u2019m typically the outdoor survival and path finding expert, with the added ability to mask the movements of the entire group (pass without trace). \n\nMy character uses the Tasha\u2019s features.",

The second was much more fun though: an Aarakocra Beast Master with the Magic Initiate feat for Find Familiar and the Druidic Warrior fighting style for thorn whip. I'd combo my subclass companion with Find Familiar and Summon Beast to assist allies on the ground while I flew around trying to pull enemies in the air to drop them with Thorn Whip and grappling.",
            "Conceptually, Horizon Walker without question; unfortunately, they don't get the mechanical love that they deserve to really support the playstyle.\n\nIn practice, Fey Wanderer was a lot more satisfying and unique in that it's one of the few subclasses that really wants a great WIS score and has truly unique features that suit the theme. I imagine Swarmkeeper would feel similar in play, but has enough differences to be it's own thing",
            "I love the Tasha's Ranger with the PHB Beast Master.\n\nIt guarantees not only a mount through majority play, but a unique one. Now, of course, you must also choose a small race, but that's also part of it. And, in truth, I either like to go for a DEX build, dual wielding scimitars or else doing a STR build and building up to Dual Wield lances.\n\nAnd two of the best beasts to choose are Giant Crab (best AC) or else Giant Badger (burrow speed, and neither the enemy or their spells can target you through dirt), or else any beast with a 50+ movement speed (best for groups with DMs that use varied terrain with things to dart around/behind).\n\nFor giant crab builds, I like to go for halflings, since it's easiest to imagine them going into battle, standing upon their mount while using their oversized toes to grip onto the sides of the shell.",

            "Ngl, playing a melee based Horizon Walker was some of the most fun I\u2019ve ever had in DnD combat. Distant strike essentially gives you a free extra 10 feet for melee attacks, plus a free 3rd attack if you attack 2 other people first. Spectral defense, even tho it\u2019s locked to level 15, gives you free resistance to ALL of an attacks damage for a turn. Planar Warrior also converts an attacks damage to force, which is very rarely resisted by creatures, and gives you an extra 2d8 force damage on your hit by 11th level. Horizon walker is, imo, very clearly designed for melee in mind, and I think if combined with spells like Haste(you get it at 9th level) or my personal favorite, Guardian of Nature, it\u2019s a blast to play. You\u2019re basically a fighter that teleports all over the place and hits hard as hell while still actually casting spells if you want.",

The Hunter feature melee options for both offense and defense are very underrated, especially for a class that can get high AC without much issue.

Used a sling combined with magic stone and then swarm keeper feats for either damage or forced movement and crusher once I hit level 5 i was shoving people 40 feet a turn and dealing decent damage 2d6 magic stone 2d4 favored foe +10 sharpshooter.\n\nAfter 5, I took fighter till 3 and ran battlemaster, adding a d8 to hits and letting me shove even further or disarm someone. Took two more levels in ranger, then stacked the rest into Rogue because I like d6's\n\nMy damage looked something like this 2d6 (magic stone) 2d8 (shoving strike) 2d6 (favored foe) 5d6 (sneak attack) 2d6 (swarm damage dm let both hits have an affect) 1d8 (zephyr strike also advantage) and then the enemy gets moved 10 feet by crusher and 30 feet on failed strength save or if I drop the swarm damage then it's another 30 feet.\n\nI was hard to catch and pin down lol out of combat he was a hunter and a herbalist/alchemist usually feeding the group with his hunts or even making the party the few extra gold we needed by selling the kill or making some potions to sell though usually not because they were more useful to use than sell.

Today considered one of the most powerful martial builds in the game, competing at equal terms against the nearly broken Hexadins.\n\nI have two favorite and distinct builds:\n- A vanilla Hill Dwarf Hunter Ranger loosely based on Harsk from Pathfinder. He is a nature lover, self-reliant, expert in tracking and ranged combat. He built his own weapons, and his masterpiece is a \u201crepeating crossbow\u201d (XBE hand crossbow _reflavored_). Mechanically I made him more of a \u201cminion / swarm killer\u201d by attacking as much as possible with XBE and Horde Breaker, sometimes upcasting Hail of Thorns. He is actually doing quite nice as an improvised \u201cAoE\u201d niche in our party, completing quite well our casters. Goodberry, Pass without Trace and Silence are the most common spells I cast. Silence has made me one of the most effective counter against enemies spellcasters.\n- Githzerai Gloomstalker / Fighter, Sword & Board, Dueling and Defense. Here I make the most of my half-caster spell slots and the long duration of my concentration spells to really invest in the Shield whenever needed. I\u2019m a very effective melee tank besides using Half-Plate.",

The four arms makes two weapon fighting viable as you can also wield a shield, plus with un armoured bonus that\u2019s a great AC of 18.

GWM at lvl 5, Sentinel at 9, then STR, WIS, STR. Tactics: your Beast of the Land charges in, attacks (knocking enemy of any size prone with attack - 2 such attacks after lvl 11), then you move in, attack 2x with GWM Greatsword or Maul, then you back up with Beast, enemy attacks it with opportunity attack with disadvantage (he is prone) and you use reaction to do third attack with GWM. This all means 5 attacks in turn, 3-4 of them with advantage, 3 of them with GWM, total dmg can reach something like 2d8+8d6+54 every round with no resources used in tier III. If you later use Share spells with Guardian of Nature, all these 5 attack will have automatic advantage, yours deal bonus 1d6 dmg.\n\nCantrip Beastmaster:\n\nAir Genasi (small), pure Beastmaster Ranger. Druidic Warrior FS for Primal Savagery and Thorn Whip (or Shillelagh). 8/14/16/8/17/10 (or swap CON and WIS), raise WIS, you can then take Resilient CON, Warcaster, Sentinel.\nRide your Beast of the Land. Tactics: cast Longstrider on Beast for speed of 50. Charge with beast to gain Charge bonus and knock enemy prone (2x after lvl 11), then attack with either Shocking Grasp (gained from race - for hit-and-run), Primal Savagery (more dmg, or good against resistant enemies to lightning), or pull enemies closer with Thorn Whip if they run away or are too far (great against archers, mages). This means only 3 attacks at lvl 11, but damage numbers are quite good (3d10+2d8+2d6+12) and your cantrip almost always has advantage to hit. You use no resources for this tactics, so you can do it all day long easily. You are also extremely tanky (AC 19, great HPs, beast HPs on top). If you then Share Spells Guardian of Nature, you gain advantage for all attack, more HPs,\u2026 Moon Sickle helps a lot with attack bonus.\n\nPS: Thanks to strange wording of Primal Savagery, you can share this spell with your beast, which allows (at lvl 15) beast to attack 2x, knock enemy prone, then you sharing Savagery for both you and your beast attacking once with your claws (no action needed for beast).",

This means 3 attacks from lvl 5 in most battles!\n\nWith things like Multiattack Defense, AC 20, CON 16, temp HPs from lvl 10,.. you are extremely tough and spells like Zephyr Strike help with your mobility as well.\n\nWith 2HW you can later take GWM Feat and use it with Guardian of Nature so that all your attacks (3 or even more with Whirlwind) have advantage and each deal 3d6+15 dmg on hit!",

Half Plate, longsword (or battle axe), shield for AC 18.\n\nFeats: Slasher at lvl 4 (=STR 18), Shield Master at lvl 8, then STR, Warcaster (to do oportunity attacks with Booming Blade), WIS.\n\nPossible tactics:\n\n1. Attack enemy with Booming Blade attack, slowing it (Slasher), move ourself 5ft away with Swarm (no save needed), back up. If enemy moves (he needs to if he is melee), he explodes with booming energy.\n2. Attack enemy once (-10 speed thanks to Slasher), then use Shield Master BA to knock enemy prone (you have high STR and Expertise in athletics, so chance to knock enemy prone is cca 90%), then attack for the second time with advantage (enemy is prone) and either move yourself 5ft away and back up, or push enemy 15ft back against the same (your WIS is 16, so it should be high enough DC). Now that enemy is 15ft away (+ how much you back up), prone, his speed is -10, so he can't reach anyone that round and attack.\n3. After lvl 11 when your swarm not only pushes, but also knocks prone: 2 enemies - Hit one enemy once and slow it down (Slasher), then use BA to knock that enemy prone with Shield Master, attack second enemy with sword, use swarm to push him 15 ft away and knock him prone, back up. Now you have one enemy prone and 15ft away (+how much you back up), second enemy prone and with -10 speed (so for enemies with 30 speed, if you back up just 15ft back, they won't be able to reach you and attack).\n4. With Warcaster you can do opportunity attacks with Booming Blade, locking enemy prone, or dealing extra Xd8 dmg to them if they still want to move to attack your friend.\n\nAnd Shield Master also means better DEX saves and evasion, so you don't have to fear Fireballs or Dragon Breath\n\nIf you crit anyone (quite probable, because you usually have 1 normal attack and 1 with advantage, so 3 d20 rolls), they attack with disadvantage for whole round (Slasher).",

Again 4 attacks, but 2 with advantage and GWM bonus now.\n\nPossible tactics from lvl 7: Use BA to gain 10 ft flying speed, fly 10 ft above your enemy. You can attack that enemy, because your weapons have Reach, but that enemy can't attack you, because you are 10ft away and normal weapons have reach only 5ft. Move 10 ft horizontaly towards your party after 3 attacks - enemy either has to run all around your reach (he will not have enough movement to reach your party member) or run under you, so you get opportunity attack again from PAM feat.

A classic that can focus on power output with features like foe slayer for that extra d8 a turn.\n\nI've kinda dumped wisdom and left it at 13 or 14 in order to multiclass and just make sure not to take spells with a saving throw. Beyond lvl 5.\n\nCharisma was my main stat. So I multiclassed into warlock to get some extra spell slots and an aoe fear ability for when in close range with melee enemies.\n\nThen I took pact of the tome for some utility ritual casting including a familiar to use as a scout aswell as misty step from the familiars location as you need to see the location which you can through the senses of your familiar.\n\nThen I took some lvls of fighter for a second fighting style to up my ranged to hit bonus so I can use sharpshooter feat more consistently. Usually my first shot is with sharpshooter and only if I miss I use my second shot without sharpshooter to ensure at least 1 hit per turn.\n\nI took the battlemaster subclass for fighter to get those martial trick shots in there like menacing strike, distracting strike and trip attack. All of these can be flavoured as special arrows for cinematic purposes. An arrow with a faint purple shadow leaves the bow for the menacing strike. A whistling arrow(real life thing) will distract an enemy and a forked arrow will trip someone.\n\nSo now my ranger(dead-eye) can fill quite some roles as a face, social, scout, damage dealer, controller, battlefield control(plant growth, spike growth).\n\nAs his character development he had only 1 good eye. His patron granted him devils sight to improve on his vision, together with darkness and elven accuracy he was a sharp shooting beast. Hardly ever missing his target.\n\nNow to complete his feature kit and being able to fill any party role. Aswell as make him viable for solo adventuring as self reliability is one of his personal standards and ideals I took 1 lvl of twilight cleric. To get some healing capabilities. \n\nThe deity fully restored his shot eye up to improving it beyond normal capabilities, granting him 300ft darkvision.\n\nNow he and his moon druid partner were ready to hunt rogue dragons where the druid shaped into a flying mount, with extra movement from her monk training. With deadeye on her back they would hit a dragon from over 500ft in Complete darkness either fearing the dragon, hurting the dragon or tripping the dragon. If the dragon was foolish enough to persuit and not return to it's lair they were doomed before the fight even really started as even with dashing the dragon would never be able to catch up to this cloaked in darkness dragon killing duo.",

I use my drakewarden as my proxy in close range fighting along with my bestial spirit spell which has advantage when near my drake, so they make for a nasty combo.

            "I had the exact same thought as far as spell components.  Looked it up and spellcasting rules say you can hold a focus with the same hand you use for the somatic component, so as long as your Druidic Focus is also a Quarterstaff you are likely fine.\n  \nThe only argument I see is that the Club/Quarterstaff may be considered a costly component since the PHB gives it a cost (even if the spell doesn't) so someone can argue you have to have a free hand to access it.  Hopefully the DM will work with you, but component rules are super strange.",
            "Ah, okay. Then yes those are compatible with each other.",
            "It also has other material components so your Quarterstaff also has to be a Druidic Focus to make this work.",

            "I played a Shilleghlah + PAM + shield Swarmkeeper and my DM was happy for me to use that as my focus. It already used my bonus action on the 1st turn of combat to set up, and it's hardly an overpowered combo (very fun though!)"

        "content": "I wanted to play a bit of a shady conman in this campaign and my initial idea for this was a Changeling Bard. During session 0 another player was also already set on playing a Bard, so I decided to keep the concept but with a Warlock instead - Archfey patron (mostly for flavour), still going for the typical face skills, while supplementing it with debuffing/control and useful out-of-combat spells, plus all the rituals from Tomelock at level 3 later on. \n \nMy problem: I'm currently at level 2 and don't really get to use half of the stuff I built the character for. Two party faces is one too many, kinda should have seen that one coming. This is totally not the other player's fault, it's just that I'm less assertive and frankly not as good at RP. Plus, at the end of the day a Bard lends itself to this role better than a Warlock. Another player also decided to play a Wizard instead of their initial concept, so my non-combat spell utility is kind of redundant and unnecessary as well. \n\nOh yeah, I did not take EB, which is probably the single biggest mistake in this entire mistake of a build. \ud83d\ude2c So here I am in combat with a single semi-decent spell (Sleep) and not much else. The earliest point at which I could get to at least the EB + Agonizing Blast baseline is level 5 in a couple of months. \n\nSo, my question is: Are there any other ways ways to start \"fixing\" this that don't take 3 more levels? How much more would I screw myself if I decided to just drop the Warlock and multiclass into something else at level 3?\n\nEDIT: Originally forgot to mention this, but I did talk with my DM and he does not want characters to be remade in the middle of the campaign.

I thought I could make my idea work as a Warlock, but along the way I somehow overlooked 'Y' (the changes you'd like to see made to your character). Would it be ok if I made those changes?\" Make them understand that you got flustered when \"remaking\" your idea and forgot a couple of things. \n\nYou're level 2 and it doesn't sound like you're in a 'serious' enough campaign that would frown upon a little class restructuring.

            "Assuming that this whole situation isn't a dealbreaker for you, there are options available!\n\n1. Your DM says they're a fan of organic growth, so I'd try and find moments to organically have your character's story fit another class - play their game, so to speak. Now, I don't know your campaign, but there's plenty of options to go from Archfey to something else. Find nature despoiled, or some great tragedy? Swear an oath of the ancients, vowing to preserve nature and goodness. Maybe you could get into a major disagreement with your patron and lose your power, relying more on your rogueish charisma to make do? Or, perhaps, you meet someone else who is interested in the natural world like you, or you start using your fey powers to better your shapeshifting, so you can become a druid. Or, maybe your character starts a religion, with your patron diefied, and you switch to cleric (Nature cleric can actually be pretty good if built smart, as an example, but something like Trickery could easily fit, or even peace if flavored as more of like, a hedonism domain). If you've spoken to your DM, and you take actions in character that would lead you down another path, hopefully they would let you reshuffle once it fits like, the story narrative.\n2. If you still have to play warlock for the foreseeable future, at level 3, pact of the tome would allow you to pick up magic stone. Magic stone is actually a spell I would want anyway in a party with a wizard. Basically, for levels 3 and 4, you would create the stones and throw them. The damage isn't amazing, but it's better than non-warlock cantrip damage because you add your charisma to the damage already. At level 5, you can get agonizing blast and eldritch blast, but magic stone isn't obsolete. If your wizard buddy is willing to do some teamwork, they can pick up the spell \"tiny servant,\" which animates an object for 8 hours, and it animates 3 objects when cast as a 4th level spell later. The tiny servants can actually be told to \"Pick up and throw the stones \\[your warlock pc\\] drops at the last enemy one of us damaged,\" and they'll do so. This gives a nice little boost for damage at the cost of casting a bonus action spell every turn, which an eldritch blasting warlock doesn't mind doing that much.\n3. Alternative warlock option - Sprites! At level 3, take pact of the chain, and gain a sprite familiar. They're already the fey option, so easy thematics there, and there's one part of pact of the chain that doesn't usually see play - the ability to let your familiar attack when you take an attack. This lets you spend your action to have your familiar take a shot with their bow, which deals 1 damage and forces the creature to make a DC 10 con save. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned for 1 minute, with no subsequent saving throws, and if they fail by 5 or more, the target falls unconscious. Now, normally, when a warlock goes for this strategy, they also immediately get investment of the chain master at level 3, and I'd ask if they would allow that, but if not, it's a solid level 5 option - it allows you to have your familiar attack as a bonus action, and it makes it so the poison's DC becomes your spell save DC. Now, is this strategy amazing? Eh? It's really good debuffing and it feels really unique, but the sprite is super fragile, so you need to play smart. Because your sprite uses their reaction to attack, they can spend their action turning invisible every turn, and with a 40ft fly speed, they should always be out of reach of melee attackers, and be near permanently invisible. At level 4, I'd look into getting inspiring leader so they have some temporary hit points, and also ask your bard to learn the Aid spell and buff your familiar instead of you when they cast it. That can give the familiar respectable toughness for, well, a familiar. I'd also take full advantage of the fact that you now have a flying ally with a ranged attack - any combat encounter against foes that don't have ranged attacks, and aren't immune to nonmagical weapons, you can just run away from and have your sprite attack from the air over and over to secure what optimizers call a 'default kill,' a situation where there's no chance the enemies can survive and you win by default. Honestly, I mention it more as an acknowledgement that that is possible, than a serious recommendation - it sounds like your table culture wouldn't smile upon that. At level 5, you will want to learn investment of the chain master, and I'd personally take summon fey - it's a powerful spell that also doesn't take any action to upkeep, and it lasts a full hour so it shouldn't be hard to justify having the fey around for every fight. So, by level 5, that leaves you with your concentration on a powerful damage dealing fairy and a debuffing sprite that's poisoning people left and right. At 7th level, your summon fey will double in power, and you'll finally be able to get eldritch blast and agonizing blast yourself if you'd like. \n4. Next time your PC gets a big cash reward, have them retire. Set up some foreshadowing beforehand, ofc, but something like \"This adventuring stuff, it's lucrative, but too much for me. With this haul, I'll have enough to spend several years drinking the finest wine, and who knows, maybe I can start a family,\" can be enough for a hedonistic character to maybe relax and settle down for a bit. Then, you can bring in someone new. Talk with the DM of course, set up that this would be the natural end-point for this character's story arc if you can.\n\nAlso, until you level up, I assume you have a decent dex, since warlocks only get light armor? I would buy a heavy crossbow and some bolts, and/or some nets. Nets are a niche but powerful option, restraining foes on demand, and a heavy crossbow will be less accurate than a cantrip, but like, better than nothing. If you're not in an environment where you can buy things, see if one of your allies has a spare ranged weapon, or ask your DM if you can spend time during short rests weaving nets. Another option would be throwing oil flasks (or, if you have the spell, having an unseen servant pour oil on enemies) if your wizard is using a fire damage cantrip. 5 bonus damage is about as much damage as a firebolt would do on average, so that's another option to contribute between sleep spells. Hopefully stuff like that can tide you over until level 3.\n\nHope any of this helps!",
            "The DM should be the first person to talk to about this.  Tell them that you\u2019re not sure where you fit in best.     \n     \nAs far as party face goes, you could lean the other way from the bard\u2019s temperment.- Good cop/bad cop.      \n      \nIf you don\u2019t have a pet owner take Pact of the Chain.      \nIf you don\u2019t have a gish in the party, you can fill that role by taking Blade.       \nIf you want a control type vibe ask your dm to let you pick up EB(or wait till you get another cantrip) & Repelling\u2026 Warlocks imo are best at this.      \n       \nSurely you don\u2019t have every single niche filled by everyone else in your party except you.

            "If your set on fixing it we will need to know a few things, notably the other characters in your party. And your ability scores, as well as what goals you would have for the character and your current spells, if possible for you to write our your whole character background and such it would help",
            "You can definitely fix this character with pact of the tome you can get eldritch blast + agonizing blast + hex which will give you baseline damage the entire campaign\n\nPick up other cantrips like guidance, shillelagh+ booming blade or green flame blade (melee option) because sometimes you just get stuck in melee. If you prefer just ranged options I like mind sliver or chill touch for regenerating enemies. \n\nAs a known caster you are allowed to swap 1 spell on level up rules as written. Same with invocations. Swap out sleep when it gets out-scaled. \n\nYou have access to faerie fire as a fey lock which is always a great support option.\n\nWith book of ancient secrets you can pick up find familiar - always useful but if your wizard has it you can copy it into your spell book for 50 gp. Speak with animals, purify food and drink/detect poison and disease to stand out. Otherwise detect magic and unseen servant if your party doesn\u2019t have them for whatever reason. \n\nIf you have 14 dex moderately armored at 4th level can greatly improve your defenses. Otherwise I\u2019d go for fey touched for flavor and pick up bless, command, or silvery barbs if it\u2019s legal, maybe even charm person for flavor. \n\n2nd level spells options - mirror image for defense, shatter for aoe, misty step if you don\u2019t want fey touched, \n\n3rd level spells you can stand out with summons as the bard can\u2019t summon and the wizard likely will take fireball and counter spell.\nYou can pick up summon fey for flavor or undead or shadow spawn up to you - they always upcast well. Hypnotic pattern the bard will probably pick up but it\u2019s still a fight winning spell you can have every short rest. Fly and counterspell are always great. \n\nJust with those selections I think you will have a pretty solid character levels 3+.",

            "Next level you could get Chain Pact for an Imp Familiar who is quite helpful to a party face. Neither you, the Bard, nor Wizard should have much Wis for Insight. It has a +3 and can telepathically tell you when they think someone is sus. Both of you can take a stab at the check for pseudo advantage. \n\nThen grab Mask of Many Faces, and Friends at Warlock 4 to be a much better Changeling than a Changeling. We can play bad cop. We can play bad guy. Make the Bard look like a hero with the shopkeep as we attempt to steal, get caught by the Bard, book it out and Disguise into a sweet old lady round the corner. We can turn NPCs against NPCs by casting Friends while impersonating them. Tons of options. Try to brainstorm with the Bard out of session to get them in the mindset of tag teaming social encounters. If talking about plans out of character in a social encounter is taboo at your table, Message is an excellent cantrip to speak to an ally without others hearing what you've said.\n\nIf you get tired of this playstyle or it doesn't work out between you two that much then we can switch Pacts again at Warlock 8. Talisman is nice to just hand them extra skill check bonuses. Two party faces isn't overkill though. They're going to get unlucky even on their best Cha skills at times and roll something awful. Always nice to have someone step in and take another crack at it if possible. \n\nUsing the Help Action in these situations could also contribute to their social check. There are some rules about being able to improve the situation in order to qualify, and proficiency is definitely a qualifier most the times.

            "Sadly their GM has banned ALL swaps for invocations AND spells :\\\\",
            "The other choice would be to start putting levels into Sorcerer: either Abberant Mind, Clockwork or Divine Soul would work the best.",
            "One thing to look at as well, in the bottom part of Eldritch invocations, it says you can swap one out when you gain a level in this class. Not sure if that's what you meant but there is a part in there specifically about changing one every level",
            "This isn't something you're going to want to hear, but I'd leave the game. It sounds like your DM is sabotaging you (not necessarily maliciously). Let's break it down so you can understand what I mean. \n\nFirst, changing invocations is an option baked into the rules of the Warlock class. It's not an optional rule like multiclassing or feats. As your DM, he obviously has the power to overrule that, but there is literally no reason to do that except to be able to say no to players. Changing invocations (or any other class feature that is Rules-As-Written swappable) is part of the design of the Warlock class just as much as short rest spell slots or Mystic Arcanum.\n\nSecond, you have no role currently. This isn't inherently a problem, like if you're intentionally playing a jack-of-all-trades, but you're *not*. You're trying to play a party face while outclassed. You're trying to play a support/control caster while outclassed. Your character serves zero purpose in the party, especially since as you said you're a little less Gung ho about RP.\n\nThe DM's job is to create and/or tell a story/world where the players and DM can work together to write the ending. It is ALSO the DM's job to make sure their players are having a 'good time.' That definition changes from campaign to campaign, but the important thing is that you're *not having a good time with your character.*\n\nSo, to recap. Your DM has: \n\n1. Introduced unusual and unfairly restrictive rules that go against the design of the game.\n\n2. Allowed you to have a character that has, effectively, no useful actions to take in or out of combat, then when you realized the state of your character, \n\n3. Prioritized enforcing his own completely arbitrary rules instead of allowing you to have any fun with your character (or even a totally different character).\n\nAltogether, this sounds like either poor DMing or the DM is specifically against you having fun. Leave this game, you are 3 levels behind and you will not have fun.\n\nIf you're committed to staying with this party, I guess my best advice is bring a book or your Switch or something so you at least have something to do all session.",
            "Don't take wizard spells. Copy them from the wizard. Especially find familiar and tiny hut. If you can buy spell scrolls grab water walk,\u00a0 meld into stone and divination rituals to transcribe.\u00a0",
            "Tell your DM you're swapping them because that's how the warlock works. \n\nYou're not asking for some special exceptions from the rules. It literally is the rule:\n\n> Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.",
            "Have you tried asking?\u00a0\n\n\n\"Hi Mr dm. I am really enjoying the story and roleplay atmosphere you have built but I am struggling to find a niche in the party with the way others have built their characters. Would you mind if I changed my build slightly as it is impacting how I enjoy and engage with the game on a mechanical level? I don't plan on changing class or subclass and this would be a one time adjustment to fit the party.\"\u00a0\n\n\nYou aren't wanting to swap invocations each level to grab the most broken for each situation, you want to fix a build that isn't working in your party. Worst he can say is no. You could also ask for his help fixing your build and see if he can suggest changes, which might make him more open to adjustments.",
            "Your DM sees no issue with you having no actions to take in combat or out of combat (other 'face' does the talking) during the game, and refuses to allow any action to fix this for a reason that sounds random.  This is a humongous red flag.  Sure hope this guy is great in other departments because this alone puts him at like -6.\n\nYour DM is literally houseruling to avoid you being able to have stuff to do.\n\n> Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.\n\nLike in a vacuum this sounds suuuuper bad.\n\nMechanically, I literally dunno.  I cannot offer advice because who knows what your DM will houserule?  It's not an answerable question.  It requires reading your DM's mind to know what they think will be fine and what won't.\n\nGoing just warlock and accepting that you don't have mechanical actions you can take that will be of benefit to anyone, make sure you've got a book to read on your phone so you can snooze through combat etc is probably what you 'should' do?  Like multiclassing is unlikely to help hugely.  I doubt you've got anything big except charisma?  Without hexblade, something like paladin or what have you is not going to work.  Sorcerer would require 3 levels to get off the ground, and would want EB/agonizing to use with quicken as the point of the multiclass so you're probably just best going warlock at least to 4.  You could use your ASI to get agonizing blast via that feat that gives an invocation, but you'd be using up an ASI to do something you'd get at level 5 anyway.\n\nLike I dunno.  3 Levels of literally no mechanics you can interact with in a game of D&D just sounds... ugh.",
            "Mid game you are level two, you have had like what 2 sessions?",
            "Maybe it's time to announce that the warlock is retiring. He's realized he isn't cut out for adventuring. Your next character will be an arch fey warlock but this time with eldritch blast.",
            "If you find you want better armor, then you could take the feat for medium armor and shields at level 4. Also you could work with the wizard and get them to craft you a few scrolls of shield spell.   \nTechnically, you could still take pact of the tome and pick up Shillelagh, eldritch blast and booming blade so all your attacks come off of charisma and you've got a baseline for all distances. Only problem there is not getting extra attack...",
            "If not the best on lvl 1, imagine on lvl 5.\n\nFriend, this house rule is horrendous and crippling for you. Also crippling for the Bard as they pick spells as swapping is part of the growth of the character, but specially for you that have multiple things to swap as you level up.\n\nYou are insisting on dealing with this in a in game solution, but this is a out of game problem. You need to sit down with the DM and tell them you are not having FUN. If they say big deal, leave. A DM has to work with you on your enjoyment. Swap chars, swap subclasses, or swap features, they need to pull their head out of their asses and realize they will lose a player if they want to hold their world above fun.",
            "Yeah, I'm aware of that part, that's unfortunately exactly what is off limits due to house rules.",
            "To be fair, they're houseruling the whole \"no changes\" thing for everyone, it's not something that specifically targets me. As far as I understand it, there's no swapping for known spells, Battlemaster maneuvers, fighting styles, the whole list ...\n\nOther than that there aren't any other big house rules I'm aware of. We use variant encumbrance and are very, very precise about weight tracking, travel, rations and so on, but I don't think that's super relevant for character building. :D\n\nBut yeah, after reading all the answers in this thread, I think I'll just choose the route of sending this character off to a hopefully heroic death and rerolling something else.",
            "We're at around session 10 or 11 (leveled up two sessions ago I think), it's a very slow game.",
            "That's.... a bad house rule. It's not an optional mechanic, like multi-classing or Feats. It's a baseline feature.",
            "Naw man, you gotta stand up for yourself sometimes. You're playing a warlock and part of the warlock kit is the fact they can swap their invocations from time to time.\n\nWhat he force wizard to never change their prepared spells?? Unless he does that too, tell him to shove it. Politely of course.",
            "Their table their rules and all that... But have they at least given an explanation as to why warlocks can't do one of the baseline features?  Have they taken away action surges resting on a short rest?  Do clerics have to learn spells like a wizard? I'm struggling to find sense in their house rule",
            "Dauym, that's way too much \n\nIf you aren't enjoying the character then there is no reason to play and the session becomes a chore instead of immersive experience, Hell I even allow my players to change their subclasses/race by completing certain quests which are extremely fun to run for me and the players.\n\nObviously there are limitations and restrictions imposed so this don't turn into something that is frequently abused",
            "That's a pretty serious nerf, given that some invocations are locked behind a level progression barrier.\n\nWithout the ability to trade them out, you'll lose the opportunity to take many of them after level 5.\n\nFor example, there are 6 invocations that require level 15 to attain, but you only gain one \"slot\" at 15, and another at 18, so you essentially just miss out on the other 4 because you can't trade them out.\n\nYou'll be stuck using the more basic options at later levels, instead of allowing your character to grow as your options expand.",
            "Are they saying the bard can't switch out spells when they level?",
            "Damn... That sounds miserable for a lot of reasons. If you are unhappy though and he won't relent. Quit, it's a game you are supposed to have fun it isn't a job, sure you will have to do things you won't always like but if you don't even like your character, move on. Life is too short.",
            "And one specifically designed to solve this specific issue",
            "Action surges work as normal, so do Clerics. From what I can tell, it basically includes all features that let you swap out stuff between levels. I got explicit confirmation for known spellcasters, invocations, Battlemaster maneuvers, as well as all of the optional versatility stuff, but I imagine it'd also include other subclasses with similar features. \n\nAs for the explanation, paraphrasing a part of our conversation: They're a fan of organic character growth and \"building upon previous choices instead of flitting from one feature to the next\". They want to reward good planning and discourage chasing after something new each level.",
            "That is a very good question.",
            "Yes, same for all other known casters.",
            "Well, I am a fan of the story and the other parts of the campaign, it's just the mechanical side I'm not having much fun with with this character (and it's not like this is a very combat-heavy campaign). I think there's a lot of fun to be had here, maybe just not with my current character. So I'd rather reroll via suicide than outright quit.",
            "Sounds like time to find a new DM to play with. I'm all for the organic growth of characters but that said removing that kind of agency from your players... You might as well write a book.",
            "Organically \u201cgrow the story\u201d. Your DM has a limited mind. You have a patron.

They need to get their nose out of the adventure book and \u201corganically grow\u201d as a DM.",

Waiting until 5 is a significant delay.\n\nAlso, some of the higher level prerequisite invocations are essentially upgrades over other ones. Taking Master of Myriad Forms for example to replace Mask of Many Faces. You likely wouldn\u2019t want to dedicate 2 of your precious invocations to such similar functions, and progressing from one to the other does feel like organic growth for a character who likes to disguise themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, you find yourself in a situation where a house rule is nerfing your character and making them difficult to play. My advice is don\u2019t play a Warlock under these conditions. See if the DM will lift this restriction or let you change character. If not, politely drop out.",
