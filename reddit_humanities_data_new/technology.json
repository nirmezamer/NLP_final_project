Thank you for joining us!**\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally changed the relationship kids have with social media, which has become a space that teenagers increasingly turn to for socializing, trying out emerging identities and seeking advice. As the risk of mental health problems has risen with the time youth spend online, we looked at ways that parents, experts and young adults themselves have suggested to navigate better between digital and non-digital worlds. ***Join us today, June 18, at 12 p.m. ET.***\n\n**Who is here:**\n\n* Expert: Dr. David Bickham research director at Boston Children's Hospital's Digital Wellness Lab. Bickham\u2019s research explores media as an environmental factor that can influence children\u2019s physical, psychological, social, and academic well-being.\n* Barbara Ortutay, a technology reporter at the AP.\n* Jocelyn Gecker, an education reporter at the AP.\n\n**More from the series:**\n\n* [Keeping children safe on social media: What parents should know to protect their kids](https://apnews.com/article/social-media-kids-teens-instagram-tiktok-parents-safety-45df57c32384207ffedc463870b8a6d2)",

Do you think laws banning or limiting teenager access to these platforms could even be effective, let alone a good idea in the first place? I'm strongly of two minds on this subject, would really like to know what you think!",
            "As a millennial, I\u2019ve been able to be right in the middle of social media\u2019s exploding popularity and was caught up in the \u201csocial status\u201d of it growing up. I was worried about friends/followers/what I posted and how people would view me. \n\nAs I got older, I got out of that thought process and began to avoid it like the plague. It began to seem like a rat race to me that I wasn\u2019t interested in and looking back, can definitely see some of the mental health effects y\u2019all wrote about. \n\n*My question is, with it still being in the infancy of what we know about the long term effects, what can be done to address its impacts?* I just saw something recently about wanting to pair a warning with negative effects of social media just like smoking. \n\nI just turned 30 and have eradicated most social media. I recently got back on IG and the reels reel me in sometimes. *But more than anything, what I realize now is that the former want to check social media and what\u2019s new has proliferated into everyday life. I\u2019ll check my phone constantly now, that has minimal social media, like you check the fridge over and over again hoping something you want is in there* \n\n*Are there plans to look at long term negative effects down the road of social media/technology and its impact on teens as they grow older?*",

            "How many of the negatives are so ingrained into social media from the start? I haven\u2019t used some popular sites social media in over 10 years and the dark patterns definitely existed then. Can social media where most interactions are with people we don\u2019t know be healthy while still \u201cfiltering\u201d content to be what we\u2019re interested in?",
            "Any general suggestions to parents? What to look out for, what to do when the topic comes up with younger children, or even just general best practices?",
            "Do you see evidence or believe that certain major events or daily interactions would have been/be drastically without the presence of social media? Do the kids you talk to ever consider this? \n\nFor example, the recent campus protests. Protest happens, but did the drive to make content change the nature of SOME (not all but some) of the protesters to possibly go to greater lengths to stand out on social media? And what about more every day interactions? Do teens feel that arguments/incidents being filmed and posted are keeping people in check or do they see how it may distort the full version of what happened? I guess this is just a \"how much of social media do they see as real life\" question?",
            "At what point should society as a whole ban these types of applications because of the visible damage they do?   Can you picture a social media app that wouldn\u2019t have detrimental effects, and what might that look like?",

            "In our surveys of young people, they are pretty positive in terms of the perceived impact of social media on different aspects of their lives.\u00a0 They especially see it as enhancing their friendships and peer relationships, but even with issues related to mental health (we asked about their mood) more say that it is helpful than say it is harmful. \n\nThere are a couple important exceptions. Many young people said social media makes them feel worse about their body and worsens their attention span.\u00a0 Also more than 50% said they were at least \u201csomewhat addicted\u201d to screen media. 58% said that they use an app or tool on \\[their\\] phone or tablet that tracks how long \\[they\\] use it. So they seem to be working to be aware of their use and potentially reduce it. \n\nIn other studies and conversations it is clear that they are very thoughtful about the impact of these platforms on their lives. They can often give specific examples of pretty negative experiences (at least ones that they witness even if it doesn\u2019t happen to them), and they tend to want to find the types of online social spaces that are civil and not toxic.\u00a0 I\u2019m optimistic that the youth themselves will help drive change in this area as they move toward the types of places that give them the types of experiences they are looking for.\u00a0\n\n\u2014 DB",
            "This is a great question. Kids know that too much social media is bad for them. In our interviews with teens, we have found they agree with research that says too much time spent online makes kids feel anxious or depressed or lonely or sad. We have spoken with several groups of pre-teens and teenagers, and they all say they find it hard to put down their phones but they wish they didn't spend so much time online. Kids agree that there should be limits because it is too hard for them to control the amount of time they spend online.\n\nIf you want to know more, we let many teens and young adults share what they wish they\u2019d known about social media, here: [https://apnews.com/article/influenced-social-media-mental-health-advice-620e277528728498c1202690d0512f85](https://apnews.com/article/influenced-social-media-mental-health-advice-620e277528728498c1202690d0512f85)\n\n \u2014\u00a0JG",

            "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single answer for what apps are more harmful than others. Kids we spoke to had different answers. For some, it\u2019s TikTok because of its endless scrolling and addictive algorithm. For some it\u2019s Instagram, where posts from influencers promote unrealistic beauty standards. For some, especially boys, the answer is video games, or YouTube. Even location-tracking apps can raise concerns \u2013 for instance, is it healthy for teenagers in a relationship to constantly track each other\u2019s location? At the same time, kids also spoke about finding positive messages about body image on Instagram, about finding new hobbies through TikTok and YouTube. So the answer can vary from person to person.\n\n\u2014BO",
            " When talking about social media apps, while the platforms may vary, some of them share features which would be more or less cause for concern. For example, your question mentioned scrolling through videos vs messaging, which is a great comparison to start with! Some researchers call these active and passive social media use, and active social media use, like engaging directly with content and friends, might be more beneficial than simply scrolling through videos on something like your For You page. However, there have been recent criticisms of this model, like that it doesn\u2019t necessarily consider other factors like individual differences between users and of the content they see (examples of articles that challenge the active/passive hypothesis: [Does Passive Social Media Use Harm Well-Being?: An Adversarial Review: Journal of Media Psychology: Vol 35, No 3 (hogrefe.com)](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/full/10.1027/1864-1105/a000358); [Social Media Browsing and Adolescent Well-Being: Challenging the \u201cPassive Social Media Use Hypothesis\u201d | Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication | Oxford Academic (oup.com)](https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/27/1/zmab015/6413702?login=true)). \n\nThinking about content specifically, some topics may affect some users in more harmful ways \u2013 scrolling through cat videos might cause very different feelings than scrolling through videos of influencers with the \u201cperfect\u201d body; Our research shows that almost half of teens feel like social media can make them feel worse about their bodies. However, messaging with friends and making connections online can have great positive effects for young people, and in the same Pulse Survey, 69% of teens said social media at least sometimes made them feel supported by their peers ([Adolescent Media Use: Attitudes, Effects, and Online Experiences - The Digital Wellness Lab](https://digitalwellnesslab.org/pulse-surveys/adolescent-media-use-attitudes-effects-and-online-experiences/)). This can be especially important for those who might not feel like they have a strong support network in \u201creal life\u201d ([\u201cI'm Kinda Stuck at Home With Unsupportive Parents Right Now\u201d: LGBTQ Youths' Experiences With COVID-19 and the Importance of Online Support - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X20303116)).\n\n\u2014DB",

            "There has certainly been a shift in the last few years, especially since the COVID lockdowns accelerated teens\u2019 (and parents\u2019) technology use, and because there has been more attention from the public, the media and lawmakers about the dangers of social media. Young people we spoke to were very aware of the addictive nature of scrolling through TikTok or Instagram, about the negative self-views and social comparisons they invite, although nearly all of them still said this didn\u2019t stop them from using it. Some said they just couldn\u2019t.\u00a0 Older teens tended to be more concerned and more likely to try to put limits on their own social media use. Experts told us that tracks with young people\u2019s brain development, which is why they say 13 is probably too early for kids to get on these apps.\n\nThere is also a growing cohort of parents who are trying to limit \u2013 or even ban \u2013 social media until their kids are older, as Jocelyn explored in her[ story](https://apnews.com/article/influenced-social-media-teens-mental-health-e32f82d46ea74b807c9099d61aec25d5).\u00a0 But they are in the minority. There is an economic disparity in that families who earn more money and parents who have higher education levels tend to be more concerned about children\u2019s technology use. \n\nOne college student I spoke to pointed out that parents who work multiple jobs or are immigrants have a harder time giving kids social media lessons and teaching them how to place limits on technology. But there are a growing number of nonprofits that are trying to even out the playing field. Julie Scelfo, the founder of \u00a0Mothers Against Media Addiction, told me this: \u201cWhat I find is in talking to families who are poor, they want their child to have every advantage. And the perception is that technology is an advantage. And so they don't want their kids \u2018left behind.\u2019 But the work we're doing at MAMA is to try and sort of explode that myth.\u201d \n\n\u2014\u00a0BO",
            "On Monday, the U.S. Surgeon General called on Congress to add cigarette-like warning labels on social media. Pediatricians, parents, educators, even kids themselves have been asking lawmakers to regulate these platforms for years. After all, we have safety standards for toys, car seats \u2013 even the food children eat. And yet, the last federal law aimed at protecting children online was enacted in 1998, six years before Facebook\u2019s founding. It has become clear that tech companies, whose profits depend on keeping their users on their platforms as long as possible in order to make money from ads, are not going to self-regulate in a meaningful way.\n\nBut I am not sure bans and limits are the answer. Kids always find a way to get around bans \u2013 just ask them, or their parents. I talked to kids who say their schools ban phones, so kids get fake, old or broken phones to turn in in the morning. Then they keep tabs on their actual phone from their pocket or backpack or an Apple watch.\u00a0\n\nAge verification on social media can run into all sorts of privacy issues, and parents will still start accounts for their kids when they ask for it and lie about their ages. Some experts say it makes more sense to have platforms designed with kids\u2019 safety and mental health in mind. For instance, why can\u2019t Instagram shut off access to minors after 10 p.m.? Meta has limited how adult strangers can contact minors on its platforms (adults over 19, for instance, can\u2019t message kids who don\u2019t follow them). But there\u2019s a lot more to be done on this front, and there\u2019s general agreement among experts that regulation would help with that.\n\nAnother point that people forget sometimes is that there isn\u2019t some magic switch at 18 that turns people into responsible technology users. Adults, parents, have a lot of issues with social media overuse as well. So if we don\u2019t prepare our kids to live in this world, what happens when they turn 18 and suddenly have unlimited access to everything? I wrote about this[ here](https://apnews.com/article/influenced-social-media-teens-mental-health-5d6bcdccd154acd631ab09023e81b369).\u00a0\n\n\u2014BO",
            "There is considerable scientific research being conducted to better understand the impact of social media and other forms of technology use. Some of it is longitudinal: it follows the same people over time. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study ([https://abcdstudy.org/](https://abcdstudy.org/))\u00a0 is looking at brain development during adolescence and has some measures of technology use (although it would benefit from measuring more details of this use). \n\nSome early findings show how some types of screen use is related to sleep disturbances: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352721823000347](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352721823000347)\u00a0\n\nThere are other people who are doing shorter-term studies and looking more deeply into how different types of social media use and experiences impact mental health and development. Even this work, however, makes it hard to really understand if it is the use that causes these outcomes.\u00a0 It could be that underlying issues (like existing risks for depression or ADHD) lead to both more use of technology and worse outcomes.\u00a0 \n\nAll that said, we have enough information to start encouraging certain behaviors that are likely to reduce negative impacts.\u00a0 Using social media to connect with friends and develop relationships is likely a positive use.\u00a0 Being a critical and intentional user, has the potential to avoid some of the biggest pitfalls. We also work closely with the tech industry to translate our research findings into recommendations about design choices that can encourage healthier use.\n\n\u2014DB",
            "I\u2019m happy to be here to help support the AP team and chime in with some thoughts based on my research and experience! I tend to leave the job of writing post headlines and similar things to the journalists who are definitely experts in that kind of thing.\u00a0\n\n\u2014\u00a0DB",
            "Social media is not only constantly evolving, the definition is broadening. Sites like YouTube or TikTok might not look like typical social media, but they play key roles in how young people interact online.\u00a0 We just did a study on social gaming, which really needs to be considered more in this conversation in general since so many young people interact on these sites.\u00a0 So it\u2019s hard to say negatives are ingrained in anything since there are so many different platforms using widely different approaches to engage users. \n\nThere are even social media platforms that are designed to encourage authenticity and positive, encouraging posts.\u00a0 I would say that interactions with known friends are likely the type that hold the most potential for positive outcomes, so places where that is limited or not enhanced through design should be considered carefully. There are likely more and less healthy ways to utilize sites that are directing you toward content determined by algorithms.\u00a0 Being aware of the potential negative/extreme bias of this type of content and its associated comments can help people critically think about what they see.\n\n\u2014\u00a0DB",
            "You might have seen that yesterday, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called for social media platforms to have warning labels, like cigarettes do, saying that social media use can harm to teenage mental health. That would require Congress to pass a law.\n\nIn the meantime, experts have a variety of suggestions for parents. Many experts suggest parents delay giving kids smart phones and social media until middle school. And when kids are given access to social media, to start slowly. In other words, allow one platform, not all. And to set time limits.\n\nMany experts also suggest that phones not be allowed in bedrooms at night to ensure better sleep habits. Some suggest when kids are doing homework to keep phones at a distance, because of the constant distraction posed by notifications.  \u2014JG\n\nHere is an AP article with more tips for parents: [https://apnews.com/article/social-media-warning-murthy-tobacco-061a97b8ee95da1296fb2b7e09607c0a](https://apnews.com/article/social-media-warning-murthy-tobacco-061a97b8ee95da1296fb2b7e09607c0a)",
            "First, there are really good tools available that allow you to engage with how your child uses different platforms. These settings and tools are sometimes built into the device (e.g. the phone operating system like Apple\u2019s Family and Screen Time functions), and sometimes part of the platform.\u00a0 Unfortunately, they can sometimes be difficult to find and tricky to implement, but it\u2019s worth digging into, especially at key moments like a child\u2019s first phone or setting up a social media profile. Second, remember that children\u2019s media use is learned from watching how other people in their lives use it.\u00a0 Set up household expectations about use by modeling that use. Remember that adolescents are building autonomy and independence and will push against limitations to those. So be sure to include them in the discussion about what your family sees as healthy and beneficial ways to use technology, best to start these well before they are teenagers.\u00a0 Then create rules that are consistent with these discussions and, whenever relevant, follow those rules yourself (kids are much likely to break rules they consider unfair). Overall remember that the most beneficial approach to parenting is consistent, enforceable rules/expectations combined with an environment of love and support. Applying that approach in general is shown to lead to more positive and less risky online behaviors.\u00a0\n\n\u2013\n\nThe conversation can start when children are young, but might look different and focus on different aspects of social media as they grow.

            "Many of the teens and young adults we spoke with say they realize social media portrays life in a way that is altered or not real. They say they know that the beautiful faces, the thin bodies they see on social media posts could be filtered and altered. But they also say it is almost impossible not to compare themselves to what they are seeing online. Even the older teenagers we spoke with talked about how they are aware that what they're seeing is not real with 20-20 hindsight, yet it's hard to distinguish in the moment what is real and what's not. That wisdom also comes with age. Younger kids in elementary and middle school are not yet exercising the same amount of critical thinking. The kids we have spoken with say that social media also stirs a degree of drama at school and among friends that would not take place otherwise. Kids are more mean on social media than they would be in person. That said, social media also offers an outlet for marginalized groups that might not exist in their real-life communities. Kids who identify as LGBTQ+, for example, say they have found communities online that they don't have at school. \n\n  \n\u2014JG",

Even for like menial tasks, moving files into a queue and getting some QC / QA metrics on a dataset. I always say minimum a week for any task.\n\nThe time it takes to do something is 30% of the time it takes to do it right. The other 70% of the task is all the stuff around it. \n\nSo, because I work in tech I can kinda set the stage for you. No one, and I mean no one looks at the content on these pages. The developers for this website are not like organizing themselves daily or monthly to review the content. It\u2019s all reviewed by bots. Tens of millions of hours of content is streamed from these sites everyday. The bots are programmed to review for image manipulation, possible r***, dr** usage, etc. Until now, the deepfake is not illegal so these sites don\u2019t have monitoring in place for it. Face swap is very easy to tell the difference and can be identified very easily. But truly deepfaked videos are extremely difficult to tell apart from a regular video programmatically. \n\nSo, think about this at scale. Sure there is an underage girl, underage girl is face swapped, let\u2019s send a link, they remove the video. Seems easy, right? Okay, now scale it. 100,000 request coming in a week, you have hundreds if not thousands of videos to review. How do you know any of them are real or not just someone regretting doing a scene and then hoping to have it taken down? They sign away ownership and that video is being demonetized for the creator. The video is not deep faked and it is not that person or vice versa the video is deep faked and that it isn\u2019t them. There are like so many scenarios here that people shouldn\u2019t be doing this, bots do it. \n\nSo you program the bot to scan, all day, everyday for deepfakes, and remove them all. All the time, every video. But, that takes money and time, and training these bots take huge amount of compute. This ain\u2019t something they are trying to spend the money on until it is law. So, when the bill becomes law, they will probably have a grace period. As all corporations do to implement the changes. Then there will be essentially instant removal. It is do-able in the time you are asking but not by a human at scale. In an individual case sure. But at like hundreds of thousands of requests, no, two days is not even enough to verify the video is who the person says it is without a bot scanning it.",

Meaning that for Dell, the only thing that's keeping those people there is the idea that they can be remote, and even if they completely remove remote working, those people are likely just going to leave. \n\nWorse, Dell can't just go and mass fire a bunch of people because they might not be able to quickly replace those people. Even if we want to call up the economy and all the people searching for jobs, anybody with talent and worth would likely stay far away and not bother. Not unless they are going to be offered some ridiculous compensation, which then won't make the shareholders happy. \n\nA lot of companies now can't seem to fathom the reality that workers have absolutely no loyalty and see no future in any employer. They don't want promotions and especially managerial roles because all they see is that you get a tiny little raise and a ton of work. They'd rather stay in their lower position and if they need more money go out and do a side hustle. That, or just jump ship to the next company that won't add any new responsibility but give them a raise because they want to beat whatever they were getting before. \n\nThis is going to become a tough pill for many employers to swallow. They're going to be finding more and more people unwilling to take on more responsibility, and unwilling to be loyal because they just don't care. They will jump ship to a new company, they will change careers, they will do something else rather than succumb to the idea of working themselves to death. \n\nCompanies need to rethink how they look at all of this and adapt.

            "This is going to be an unpopular opinion on here, but IA brought this on themselves during Covid. \n\nBefore Covid, IA's library worked by creating a digital scan of a physical book they owned, and lending it out digitally one at a time based on the number of copies they owned. \n\nNo one really had a problem with that, although it was never really tested in court. \n\nDuring covid, they removed that one physical copy = one digital copy restriction. Anyone could check out their books, no restrictions. This is what got publishers pissed at them and went after them. \n\nI think digital preservation is important. I love the IA's overall mission. But my god was this such a stupid decision. And it has caused a massive setback to their preservation efforts.\n\nEdit: \n\nTo expand on a little bit on why I say I support IA, but not this specifically. \n\nI believe digital preservation is needed. But this went past digital preservation. \n\nPhysical copy = digital copy. A okay in my books. But buying one copy of something does not mean you get to give away unlimited copies. And that is not how a library works. \n\nI also believe that there needs to be massive overall of public domain laws. I think a work should be life of the author, with certain circumstances allowing something to enter sooner. If something is completely removed form purchase, and there is no legal way of acquiring something, I think it should be public domain and easily accessible. Books, movies, music, games, etc. \n\nTo me that is what digital preservation is. Protecting things from going away. And so while hypocritical, I do recognize that in order to do this piracy will happen. But I believe there is a difference between an actual mass attempt at preserving things, vs me just wanting something for free. I also think there should be some form of legal system setup to accommodate digital preservation.\n\nAnd none of this means that I think what we have now is good and that I am all just 'oh woe is the poor companies'.

Back then, it had some sense these licenses were so harsh cause nobody knew better (and companies must protect their interests, blah, blah), but these systems should have evolved by now to accomodate both the right holders and readers interest, allowing libraries (and the Internet Archive is exactly that: A DIGITAL LIBRARY) to fulfill their mission.",

So in essence, when you make a \"purchase\" on these platforms you are paying full price to have access to the thing you bought for as long as someone else feels it necessary for you to continue to have access. This is indisputably the consumer losing control of their ownership of the copy of the work they paid for. In previous eras when you purchased a form of media, say a book or a VHS Tape or a Music CD; legally you did not own the right to the work itself but you were granted ownership of the copy you purchased.
