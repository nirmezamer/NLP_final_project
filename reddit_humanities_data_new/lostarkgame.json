They're on the other side of the pacific.",

I progged thaemine on Friday and Saturday only on launch week and there were tons of groups fresh prog up to multiple levels from any gate in NM and HM. \n\nIf you're in a static that is so adamant about only doing prog immediately as though there's any difference doing it Wednesday morning vs. Thursday or even Wednesday evening, then it's probably worth finding new people to play with to prevent this issue.",
            "Yeah that's what I assumed would happen rather than a real merge is everyone still plays on their own servers usually, but the servers are connected and you can join a lobby from a different region, where you'll play on their server and you just deal with the ping.\n\nBasically how wow does it with OCE/SA/NA.\n\nBut now that they full on merged sa into nae that seems unlikely.",
            "I see, \"players,\" poor NAW players...",
            "Honestly, I regret rolling on NAW.  Fewer lobbies and half the people are from SEA/Oceania.  I would honestly server transfer if i could.",
            "The actual technical problem is the literally tens of millions of bots that have been banned but not purged from the database that will make a region merge take multiple whole days, they need to make sure if they purge accounts that they don't accidentally purge humans that were banned and may request an unban in the future, especially because of how many humans have been mistakenly flagged as bots in the last two months.\n\nIf SEA ping was the only issue, they'd just use the NAW datacenters over the NAE datacenters and tell NAE and SA to suck it up.",
            "Yeah it's weird cause you can only raid either like early morning (oceanic) or later at night (naw) anytime between 11am-5pm it's dead"

It\u2019s all pushing me away from the game that I enjoyed for so long because you need a decent static or it\u2019s just too inconsistent on a daily basis. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nMaybe we need to get back to Kayangel and Akkan level of Normal difficulty with total prog time = 5-10 hours or less. Then people can get on with their lives (I mean dailies), and don\u2019t need to push Hard Mode if they are casual and/or bad.",
            "They don't understand that normal, needs to be normal, they are making normal just a hard-light and it's terrible design.",
            "Looking at steamcharts, they are pretty effective with it. But many white knights here will tell you everything is fine xD. In my opinion Akkan is still a huge problem because it's also overtuned and new players wipe on it a lot. But they are reacting with solo mode, so we will see how that will turn out.",
            "You are missing another huge reason why it feels harder than it actually is. **Your average LoA player can't adapt if his life depended on it. Try to take someone's spot and see how quickly they'll have meltdown.**\n\nIn my 3k+ hours in LoA I've once come across a pug back in the Tranquil Karkosa where people just went through the prep zone and straight into the fight. They didn't waste time taking their positions, pinging empty spots, fighting who takes 1st and who takes 8th. None of that bullshit just to fail the gate because the mech started and someone was too far from their designated spot. Instead they picked their positions to collect orbs on the fly and did the whole dance with 1234 12334. **It was marvelous.** I've never seen another party that was this good.\n\nWe had charm mech in Vykas, you just throw a sleep bomb. It's not that hard. The only time someone dies to a charmed player is when your entire party collectively decides they are not throwing sleeps. Pay attention to that next time. There are always at least 2 people who are in range and not being attacked who could, but never throw. That's what you die to, **not to hard mechs, but to selfish unskilled bozos.**\n\n**I do agree that NM should be clearable with base line amount of effort and Thaemine NM especially is too demanding. But Echidna isn't half bad.**",
            "Normal modes should give all materials for progression, should not have wipe mechs or have them skippable with timestop, and should have like 2-4 revives.\n\nPeople should feel discouraged from clicking \"Find party\" for normal modes and just click \"matchmake\". MM system should also be smart and priorize having 1 sup on each party. Even have an option you can check to only mm with supports.\n\nHard modes, in turn, should give significantly more gold, so if anyone feels really confortable with mechs, they can do hard modes for the additional gold.",
            "The main issue with the charm mech is that a lot of people either don't know or don't respect the 4 or so normal moves that give a charm stack. All these moves do pathetic damage, so some people just pay 0 attention to them and constantly run around with 1~2 avoidable stacks. Then, they either get hit by the backstep->cone aoe move or get caught on an activated flower tile for that last stack and turn the whole thing into a shit show. But, sometimes, they luck out on the rest of the patterns or get saved by the teammates, so they carry on. It's pretty different from a good majority of Thaemine moves where you will either get killed outright or thrown offstage (and out of the group) if you don't know them.\n\nIf you're pugging and you see people regularly getting knocked up by the aoe->knockup->aoe move, which is probably the easiest one to avoid, you need to save your time/sanity and get out. If you're in a static and people keep eating that, you need to get them to learn to do them properly. You can't carry people who will keep rolling the dice at your expense in G2.",
            "Yea but if no one is mind controlled it\u2019s fine. Remember Echidna is a break raid, so make sure this doesn\u2019t reach Inven because if it does\u2026",
            "They are at least the west playerbase, didnt the playercount drop after each raid release?",
            "on my humble opinion, Thaemine Normal is highly overtune for what Normal should be. After clear it 6 times per week, I dont even know how many times i have clear it so far, feel like the boss have too much HP and hit too hard for normal at least, its fine for hard mode to be like it is, but for normal feel like need like 20% nerf in HP/Damage, and Reduce critical wound to 30 second.",
            "I'd definitely prefer if nm has no wipe mechanics or extra lives like Argos but that would have its own problems.",
            "Echidna raid is fine overall. It has learning curve but that's okey.  \nThe bigger issue is the timing of the release, Since T4 was announced and changes to the vertical progression systems like transcendence a lot of people quit normal honing parked at 1620 stop doing elixirs and transcendence.  \nThis resulting in underpowered characters. Now add the new raid debuff(players not familiar with the raid have lower uptime) And you end up with bunch of Zdps players trying to clear a DPS check raid. Even tho the normal mode DPS required is 13M,  That's assuming everyone is alive and this raid has high chance of someone randmly dying.   \nAnd the amount of people with sub 13m dps is just insane....  I've seen 6m DPS and 26m DPS.   \nUsually so far the lower skill level players were somewhat able to compensate by investing more in their characters but that's just waste of gold right now before the changes come into effect.",
            "I swear 90% of you people have never played a raiding mmo before. There is no way you complain that the raid is too hard after 2 days. And its not even a recent thing this stuff happens at every raid release and after 2 weeks nobody talks about it again because people got better at the raid.",
            "Bro the raid has been out for what? 2 days and you are complaining that it is too hard? Well no shit, it takes time to get used to it. Nobody is forcing anybody to do a kid nah. Just go on and do whatever raids you want to do. Play at your pace or don't complain about raid difficulties when you try to keep up with the latest",
            "just do gate 1 then. That\u00b4s a cheese with 0 IQ mechanics. You dont even need to know patterns, you can just tank stuff pretty much.\n\nIf G2 was like that, it would be like a chaos dungeon. The charm is pretty dumb tho, since sleeps doesnt work properly.\n\nTbh, those that do solo, will most likely end up doing Only solo.",
            "Idk what else you would expect. Lost ark has always been about hardcore raiding. Always. \n\nThaemine was expected to be very hard. They said so multiple times long before it ever released. Echidna is brand new, people have barely begun learning, so obviously it's hard right now. But its also only a 2 gatebraid you'll have on farm in no time. Behemoth is another 2 gate snoozefest. The 2 announced Kazaros raids are also only 2 gates.\n\nRaiding has never been easier. \n\nPlayers constantly complain about how hard it is for new players to get into Loa while simultaneously now wanting them to get to endgame too early. You don't get it both ways",
            "https://old.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1dl39yv/turning_down_elden_rings_difficulty_would_break/?ref=share&ref_source=link\n\nSame energy as the people being made fun of in that post ,except in the MMO genre players are used to devs cattering to all their relentless crying over actualy getting good like in every other genre that has dificult content.",
            "Then why still play?",
            "If you can't deal with raid - you need to learn raid and your character. All raids can be done by actual characters, but you need to know patterns. If you don't want to up yourself, so... Sorry, it's not your game",
            "i think the raid is not a problem in this game, the problem is  progression is only mandatory in raids with wipeout mechanics. that's shit, how about you can progress in islands killing event bosses or guild raid like you can have progression and golds exclusive for guilds who will defeat some damn bosses.",
            "I said this since the very beginning yet I had all these white knights looking dumb founded lmfao. Difficulty should scale like how other normal mmos do it, even WoW does this. One shot mechs in normal mode which easily encourages gate keeping is beyond me, what a shitty design decision.",
            "yeah normal mode should be normal and matchmake able like old Oreha day but slower reward / progression. Hardmode can have better reward/ cosmetic. They just keep very weird raid design for no reason. One person fuck up whole raid wipe, or one shot pattern should not exist in normal mode.\u00a0\n\nThier game frankly is not growing in KR currently as well. Game can not be both too grindy and hard.",
            "Problem is Koreans complained about this with Akkan. They want HMs to have a progression system of their own",
            "Valtan was peak goddamn",
            "Yeah, raid design hasn\u2019t been good since Valtan for your average gamer.",
            "that was a raid where we got each others back\n\nunlike todays find the \u00a0weakest raids",

            "g1 is a noob killer\n\nso many puddles",
            "Thaemine was harsh but a good teacher on what to avoid.  \nStand in a red mech? You are fucking dead.  \nIn echidna she tickles you with her normal patterns and then timmy sends his Brutal impact on your dome.  \nI think after people get used to the normal patterns echidna is not that bad but it will take longer to learn that thaemine because she does not punish you as quickly as thaemine did.  \nI have like 1 hour of G2 peog in me and the normal patterns are already slowly entering my brain.  \nExcept the grab, that shit gets me All The Time.",
            "It's not \"too hard\", it's not fair. Giga Echidna spawns flowers on the floor that you cant see? butterflies that spawn randomly which can easily cause a wipe 7 mins in? It's just frustrating that one player fuck up can cause a HW raid in the future resets, and the playerbase already sees this being the case.",
            "They havent ,this game is full of people who came straight from league having never played any other MMO's and it realy shows, dragon nest had wipe mechanics in raids as far back as 2010(using this one as gameplay wise its the closest to LA) ,wow several years before ,many games who had raids did have them before,but god forbid a raid isnt cleared 3 atempts into the firstday its out when we're gonna be farming it on autopilot for a year.",
            "It's not about that,yes it new raid and it's take to learn the mechanic,but it's about how much punishing if someone make one mistake and it's 100% wipe",
            "No you see hes strugling to prog a raid 2 days in thats gonna b\u00e9 and endgame raid for probably a year or longer,s\u00f3 it means the game sucks and no One should play it of course /s.\n\n\nThese are the same bozos complaining in the elden ring sub about the game being too hard",
            "I don't buy the 2 gates angle. It's 2 gates but one of them has twice the length and twice as many mechanics as a single gate. It's exhausting.",
            "The problem is you can't have an entire game built around hardcore group raiding. It doesn't work, there isn't enough of a population. Since launch, Lost Ark has lost like what, 95%+ of its playerbase? That isn't a recipe for success.",
            "Echidna is just terrible design - defend it all you want - doesn't make the encounter better - or change the fact that 1 guy getting charmed can instantly mean you have to re if he goes fast and slaps 2 players before a sleep nade hits. I've personally always hated charm mechanics but on vykas atleast it was very straightforward and not such a shitty rng fiesta. I even enjoyed thaemine 10x as much because if you died at least u know that you yourself fucked up",
            "I think you are  forgetting the fact that when this statement was true the raids were vykas and valtan, it went downhill from that.",
            "well except there is no gatekeeping and raid wipe by others messed up in Elden Ring. This is why I look foward to solo mode. You can not expect 7 other random bozos wont messed up the raid , then start to flame one another then vote quit after 30 mins if you just want to have a good time.",
            "And as it looks like its not gonna be anyones game in some time",
            "WoW even introduced that weird casual mode at some point as 3rd difficulty where the entire raid gets +dmg and -dmg taken buffs after each whipe up to 50% or so (I think its for normal mode machmaking ?).    \nThere should probably something similar in LostArk(+ less mechanics), just make sure that this mode is enough to progress to the next content (no need for high lv trans/bonus stats but ilvl should never be gated behind it).",
            "yea. normal, or \"easiest\" mode is too difficult for casuals. some 1 shot mechs are hard to balance, like falling off, you gunna die no matter what if you fall (even in wow), though i suppose they could tune the fight to have less knock out patterns in nm.",
            "those white knight would make good slaves back in the day",
            "Would hard mode having more mats & more mechanics not be enough of a progression system for them? Either way, MMOs need casual players to thrive and since Lost Ark's best feature is it's raiding they need to make it more casual friendly/approachable. \n\nIf they can't solve the gatekeepers ( they can't ) then they need to do it by changing the content itself.",
            "Coming from league makes the game easier (in my opinion). Never felt like something is overly difficult except getting into raid at the first place.",
            "I mean.. in league a single person can waste 20 mins of ur time xD",
            "Elden Ring bosses get easier when you let someone in your instance. \n\nLost Ark doesn't even let you play the boss and players gives you G0 treatment. Stop comparing these two games.",
            "Overlooked facts",
            "true with all the phases in gate 2\n\nfeels like gate 2 -> ghost phase (BOOBA) -> gate 3 -> ghost phase (razer ad)",
            "Honestly if they just seperate gate 2 into 2 separate gates it would relieve a ton of pressure on the fight.",
            "Maybe not in the west. But the game was not designed for the western audience. Loa has been doing just that for 6 years and, highs and lows, has always been a juggernaut in KR. \n\nIt seems a lot of Western players have a hard time coming to terms with the fact that this game wasn't made for them. They're far too used to playing Activision/Microsoft/EA games where the west is a priority.",
            "It's player issues only, if they don't want to learning. No need to cry about \"It's so hard\". Don't know, we just try raids in static, before all teammates don't learn raid in most cases. In some time we start to clear with randoms, because of work time issues. Ofc, can be gatekeeping, ofc raids can be not closed - nobody in save. But, we do everything for upgrade our hands and characters.",
            "This actually sounds like a good addition, the escalating buff thingy.",
            "Or tune every mech/dmg req. after knockoffs to be fine with 1-2 less players, or offer revives again (I think they do for the 16man raid anyways).",
            "Yea If your good at league most of the raids in this game are easy.",
            "Please ,not even a week from now echdina Will b\u00e9 in homework mode,plus id like to see yall playing without support,theres a reason you dont solo guardians despite having the ability to do so",
            "g1 feels like a mob phase with some mech from wow and id rather do 1 longer gate then a raid with 4/6 gates like vodis and old brell",
            "I don't think they're going to let the Western version of the game just die though, that's the thing. The American market in particular has a loooot of money, particularly the kind of person that Lost Ark tries to cater to. There's going to have to be some compromise between the KR and Western market, and that compromise is starting with the batch of solo raids. If they're successful, you're probably going to see solo versions creep into the newest content. Just the way it is.",
            "6 years? Yeah ok bro. Legion raids were introduced barley 3 years ago and the game is falling off since. From these comments you\u2019re just someone who has too much time and money invested so to cope with the regret you defend the game with all your heart, even if it\u2019s bad, but I don\u2019t blame you.",
            "Seems reasonable to me. I just hope the next time blood, zombies, skeletons get censored to accommodate China you'll be there to preach the benefits of accommodating other regions to bolster a games population and overall health. The western audience surely doesn't fight that every time and try to force devs to go back on their decisions. Just like I'm sure the KR audience will happily have their game changed to accommodate us",
            "You talk like a child",
            "Most games do censor that stuff for China (WoW did I know), but that's not really gameplay system related. I mean I don't know what else you want the devs to do, the game is/was dying in the West and when they launched the game they saw a huge profit increase only to see it dry up over the last year and a half because of the issues the game has. There's still going to be hard raid content, just maybe offered in both group and solo options. I don't think that's a problem.  Do you just want them to shut down the game in the West and lose out on all that market?",
            "I'm a Redditor on Reddit. I'm not qualified to think up meaningful changes. I have no clue how they could do it. And to be frank it's not my responsibility to think of these ideas. Additionally I never came here to start a plight to change the world.\n\nMy comment was to acknowledge the game was not made for us in mind. We are and always will be secondary and that people should fully expect that and not go all surprised Pikachu face when they get treated that way"
