If you don't have 500 comment karma yet, you can post here too.\n\n# Hot Topics:\n\n**Where can I read leaks?**\n\n>Read Rule #3 on the sidebar for where and when to find leaks on Twitter, Discord, and fanscan sites (TCB and Shishiso scans). DON'T post leaks outside of the pre-release megathread when you find them. Don't post them in this thread.\n\n**Where can I read the official Fanbook/Databook?**\n\n>Scans and translations [here](https://imgur.com/a/HGmL2zu) and searchable text [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FCbQq3YSqQkCuO1UitrlEXKEtjV8aepWgykeyjAe_ZE/edit). Also on the sidebar and sub wiki.\n\n**What is Uraume's gender?**\n\n>Uraume's gender is currently unconfirmed.\n\n**What would happen if Yuji ate another Sukuna finger?**\n\n>We don't know since the manga hasn't answered that question. Sukuna's fingers are Cursed Objects containing pieces of his soul so make of that what you will.\n\n**Is Gojo really dead?**\n\n>Yep, looks like he is.\n\n**What is Kenjaku's plan with the Culling Game?**\n\n>In short, he's using the Culling Games to produce a lot of Cursed Energy within its Barriers, with which he plans to use to evolve the human race. He wants to create a new golden age of Jujutsu. Kenjaku has apparently not revealed all his plans, Yuki cast suspicion on Tengen (the Culling Game plan infodumper) before they fought, and Kenjaku called Tengen his \"friend\", so it's unclear if Tengen was entirely truthful. We don't yet know how Sukuna fits into this plan, even though he and Kenjaku have been cooperating.\n\n**What is Ijichi's Cursed Technique?**\n\n>How naive of you to ask. He wouldn't cheat by giving it away.",

            "What is the significance of Sukuna using the Unlimited Void hand sign for his domain? I noticed it in the most recent chapter but I don\u2019t remember it ever being mentioned why it\u2019s different from what he used previously",
            "What exactly is Heavenly Restriction? \n\nI find it confusing that Maki and Toji have no CE, so they can't create curses like other non-sorcerers, but it's not like they don't have the emotions that would create CE. And they didn't choose the restriction unlike other Vows.",
            "Can someone with a simple domain use domain amplification?",
            "In the Shibuya arc, why did Gojo not even attempt to blitz Choso, Jogo, or Mahito after he popped his .2 second domain? It does state that the cursed spirits could've awakened at any moment. Gojo still likely would have had 10 solid seconds to try to dispatch one of them. \nWhy target the transfigured humans that likely would've been out of commission for a very long time after experiencing Infinite Void?",
            "How old are the disaster curses? \n\nMahito is the youngest at couple months, and Dagon is a bit older, but still relatively young.\n\nJogo and Hanami might be around Gojo\u2019s age since curses were getting stronger to balance out his birth. Maybe even younger because they didn\u2019t seem to know who Gojo was. They must not be around that long since they didn\u2019t make any big moves to further their goal of replacing humans. At least, moves that would\u2019ve gotten them registered by jujutsu society.",
            "why did multiple important members of jujutsu high not know that Sukuna could use an open barrier domain? This seems like an actual plot hole/gege forgot moment\n\nChoso knows kenjaku could do it, Itadori has the memories of it + Inumaki was inside of it \n\nThese two things together should at least prompt jujutsu high to be aware of the possibility instead of being completely befuddled.\n\nI find it hard to believe that they didn't discuss this during the month-long preparation considering their plans' depth.",
            "With the military guys, will the people that got captured ever be returned back? It wouldn't matter too much if they didn't, but just wondering what will become of them",
            "He doesn\u2019t have enough hands to do his normal hand sign",
            "I coukd be wrong but it's apparently cuz of all the binding vows he did + the lack of his other hands",
            "we don\u2019t know what it means in effect, but symbolically it shows Sukuna\u2019s resilience\n\nThe reason Sukuna is so strong is not only because he can make Binding Vows, but because he has so much, he can easily adapt to any disadvantages he faces\n\nHe was weakened in his fights against Maki and Higu (i think it was them) who cut off two of his hands respectively. He adapts to this by stealing what he \u201clearned\u201d from Gojo and using his domain symbol\n\nSukuna will steal whatever he can from whoever he can, and abuse it until he is literally forced by the power system to stop, only for him to trade it for something better. Him stealing Gojo\u2019s domain hand sign because he can\u2019t use his own is a perfect example of this",
            "We don't know, but it probably has something to do with only having to use one hand for a domain",
            ">What exactly is Heavenly Restriction? \n\nIt's a binding vow that is forced upon the body when they are born.\n\nNanami-says translation of Mechamaru's explanation of Heavenly Restriction\n\n>It\u2019s different from a standard \u2018binding\u2019 that you self-inflict upon yourself. It\u2019s a binding that\u2019s enforced upon your body by birth\u201d\n\n>I find it confusing that Maki and Toji have no CE, so they can create curses like other non-sorcerers, but it's not like they don't have the emotions that would create CE.\n\nThey don't contribute to the birth of cursed spirit, like non-sorcerers. They have 0 CE, so they don't leak any CE that would lead to the creation of cursed spirits. Yuki says that everyone having this type of Heavenly Restriction would lead to no cursed spirits forming.\n\n>And they didn't choose the restriction unlike other Vows.\n\nThat's what Heavenly Restriction is.",
            "A pact forced on you from the moment you are born, it sacrifices CE and CT usage for a strong physical body. Mechamaru's does the opposite",
            "Every skilled enough sorcerer can use domain amplification and simple domain. DA is harder to use than simple domain that's y there r only a few DA users. Even kusakabe ,who's probably the best ever SD user , can't use DA.",
            "I believe not because every person with DA have DE. And Kusakabe outright said he can't do that.",
            "Kusakabe specifically said that he can't, and he is the best simple domain user we've seen. Also, we've only really seen DA used by people who already have Domain Expansions, but could just bea coincidence",
            "Sure, SD isn't a CT after all.",
            "If he tries to go after any of the disaster curses for any reason and they wake up and start killing people again before he can dispatch them, that makes the whole endeavor worthless. He can\u2019t risk popping his domain again and permanently mentally damaging the citizens, and if the transfigured humans wake up in the meantime then way more people die since there\u2019s so many of them. He gauged the transfigured humans as the more severe threat, but ended up getting caught off guard by Kenjaku",
            "Gojo had to decide in an instant and focused on saving lives. \n\nHe also couldn't have known how long all the CSs would stay stunned, and knew he could beat the disaster curses.",
            "Gojo can\u2019t do *everything* so if he went after the Disaster Curses in that moment, he risked the transfigured humans killing the normal ones. \n\nHe didn\u2019t know how anyone would be effected by .2 seconds of his domain. If he could at least kill the transfigured humans there would be no one left to go after the regular humans since the disasters would be too occupied with him",
            "Because he didn't know how long it would take for them to wake up, this is literally stated.\n\nIf they woke up when he went to kill them, he would have to focus them, meaning the Transfigured Humans could wake up and continue their spree",
            "This is a really interesting question.  I didn\u2019t give it much thought before.  It\u2019s a wild idea that the sheer level of curses rose because the counterbalance was just that strong.  I knew that was the case for (some) sorcerers, but the idea that curses evolved too is crazy.",
            "Jogo is probably hundreds of years old, he seems like a very old man, set in his ideals\n\nHanami is definitely younger, but she seems pretty old as well\n\nTechnically Dagon is the youngest, only being around a few minutes old by the time of his death \n\nMahito is a few months old I believe, the anime makes it seem like he was born in the theatre, but that isn't actually true",
            "Yuji probably doesn't see it as anything special, his first ever domain was Sukuna vs Finger Bearer, then he saw Jogo's, then Gojo's, then Mahito's, and then once again, Sukuna's, basically, Yuji doesn't understand why it's special.\n\nInumaki wouldn't know that it was a DE\n\nChoso saw KENJAKU do it, not Sukuna",
            "Yuji only sees what Sukuna sees. He doesn\u2019t have any knowledge past that. He probably didn\u2019t even recognize the domain as having no barriers since the range was so big and it was only activated for a matter of minutes, if not seconds. \n\n Similarly Inumaki was only in the domain briefly. He immediately fled and was focused more on his arm/helping civilians rather than Sukuna\u2019s domain\n\nFrom there, even if they knew Open Domains existed from Kenjaku, they wouldn\u2019t know for a fact that Sukuna could do the same. \n\nI don\u2019t remember JJK high being shocked at Sukuna using an open domain, more so curious how it would effect a normal domain, but that might come down to translations",
            "I don't think they were surprised by the open barrier domain, they were surprised that it bypassed the barrier of Gojos domain and was able to attack it from outside.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThey knew it existed, they did not know how it mechanically interacted with other domains.\n\n\n\n\nI might be misremembering though.",
            "That is a good question. If Gegenever mentions them again we can probably assume that the military actually succeeded in their mission. This would mean that some jujutsu sorcerers would now be test subjects, which is quite scary to think about. Especially since they would need to examine the brain in particular. My guess is that they either died or escaped before the Shinjuku showdown. We saw the bomb dude attack the military, so perhaps some got freed or killed there? Otherwise Kenjaku may have killed them. Since we have no further info this is all I can come up with.",
            "They are already dead most likely, because they haven't killed anyone.",
            "Ah, should\u2019ve guessed that lol",
            "Okay, thank you for that explanation! I was thinking about the plotline introduced in Hidden Inventory where Yuki explains to Geto about the possibilities for ridding the world of curses by getting rid of CE and if that was possible in the story in the near term. The options she mentioned were:\n\n(1) was \"eradicate Cursed Energy\" with Toji being the model, but if they're unable to choose to be Heavenly Restricted, it doesn't seem to be a viable solution (but then again she said she needed to study him.)\n\n(2) Teach humans how to control their cursed energy - kind of like the situation at present in the wider world, with curses being public knowledge and growing, then \"survival rests on adapting to a jujutsu-sorcerer based society\" but it's not like non-sorcerers can learn jujutsu so this doesn't seem to work either. Other than it being a slow Darwinian version of Geto's plan.",
            "It might also be separate skillsets, Kusakabe has managed to develop Simple Domain into an aggressive offensive option rather than being primarily defensive/reactive, so he would have less incentive to try and divide his focus between perfecting simple domain, and also learning Domain Amplification on the side, since DA's obvious advantage is that it allows you to go on the offensive with pure physical attacks.",
            "To be fair it's possible DA requires a DE, or at least all DA users we have seen have had a DE.",
            "The disaster curses are gonna wake up regardless and start killing people. Offing one of the disaster curses is easily more of a priority than a catatonic transfigurred human that got 6 months of info dumped into their distorted brain in 0.2 seconds.",
            "Fair point, but there was still a lot collateral damage of normal people dying when it was just Jogo, Hanami, and Choso fighting Gojo. One disaster curses is easily worth 1000 transfigured humans.",
            "I would post the screenshots of the chapter but i can't, its 225 if you wanna go re-read it.\n\nFor most of this I'm just quoting Choso who brings up the possibility during the fight instead of before the fight who uses his experience fighting Kenjaku and Itadori's+Inumaki's info",
            "i would post screenshots of the chapter but can't so ill recap it (its 225 if you want to look at it)\n\n1.Choso intuits based on yuki+yuji's info that sukuna could do a open domain\n\n2. Cue next page of everyone being shocked\n\nmy qualm is that choso comes up with this possibility only during the actual fight and not during the preparation.",
            "I have no idea how to post images in comments. But in 225 Choso mentions an open-barrier domain and Kusakabe, Yuta, Hakari, and Kashimo are shocked.",
            "Gojo clearly didn\u2019t think so. He can easily take the disaster curses and he knows it, so he figured it was better to thin out the enemy ranks and then deal with the others once there\u2019s only like 3 of them left",
            "Honestly not that many people die in B5. They kill a few people before hand but while fighting Gojo not that many civilians die\n\nThat\u2019s because it\u2019s hard for the Disaster Spirits to kill humans while also dealing with Gojo. The whole point of the Transfigured humans was to attack humans while Gojo was distracted with the disasters so Kenny could catch him off guard\n\nThe disasters have no reason to kill humans themselves, since if they did it would give Gojo an opening to kill them. It was safest for the civilians to eliminate the transfigured humans first",
            "I just reread it, and you\u2019re kinda right. \n\nBest answer I can give you is Choso is a dick. No one else would know that open barrier domains are a thing. He\u2019s the only one that saw Kenjaku do it\n\nI stand by my point that neither Yuji nor Inumaki\u2019s would know it\u2019s barrier less, however they both clearly noticed something was up, since Choso mentions them giving information about the domain\n\nWhat likely happened is Yuji mentioned the domain being large, Inumaki mentioned not noticing the barrier or something, and everyone assumed his domain was just super fast and large until Choso faced Kenjaku and learned that Open Domains are a thing\n\nIdk why he didn\u2019t put that info together at any point between fighting Kenny and the Sukuna fight"

            " Yeah, it\u2019s weird that people call shrine boring but wanted Gojo vs Sukuna to not have 10S\u2026like in what world is Shrine vs Infinity better than Shrine + 10S and infinity? Round 1 of the fight is almost how a Sukuna mostly using shrine would fight the battle, but without DE, he couldn\u2019t really do nothing. Sukuna having a cursed tool or application of shrine that somehow can bypass Gojos hyper specific hax would be critiqued anyway",
            "Agreed. People act like Sukuna using Mahoraga is fraudulent but without Mahoraga, the fight wouldn't even last 6 chapters and would be pretty boring. Mahoraga or rather the Adaptation process is one of the key factors as to why Gojo vs Sukuna is so entertaining",
            "Yea the fight would definitely not be as long or fun if not for the shadows.",
            "Fax if there were no 10s the fight would've been finished at the domains.",
            "Sukuna's ultimate motive was to overcome the limitless CT as a whole by making his own CT even better thus Mahoraga and Gojo were really a means to achieve that\n\nRemember when Sukuna called Gojo \"painfully ordinary\" we all laughed at it but looking back it may have been more to it than him simply mocking Gojo cz by that time Gojo hadnt pushed sukuna far enough to  really force and upgrade on his CT\n\nAnd in 236 he remarked how happy he was and he wld never forget Gojo right after improving his CT and finally overcoming the limitless",
            "No matter which way Sukuna won, people (Gojo fans) will always be mad about it. If he was in yuji (let's imagine Megumi didn't exist, a 19 finger yujikuna in this instance) and the fight got to a point where they both didn't have their domains, then Gege gives Gojo 5 more chapters of him styling on Sukuna before Sukuna figuring out the WS then one shotting him, people will still be this mad and question why Sukuna is so smart in the first place. Gege knowing killing Gojo will make his fandom seethe and rage for years to come decided 'Hey, if they are going to be mad, let me find a way to maximize their rage!'. hence we had Gojo seemingly winning for so many chapters, feeding the narrative that he was so much stronger than Sukuna. Then the agenda also raised the egos of Gojo fans, making them even more sure that Gege would never give Gojo the direct L in that fight. They pretty much expected kenny to swoop in and take sukuna and run away or sum like he did with mahito. So when reality (236) hit, it was like a tidal wave came crashing on their perception of the fight. Egos were hurt, minds were bruised, hopes were dashed, and we haven't heard the end of it till now \ud83d\ude16\n\n  \nI imagine if Sukuna had the 10S and didn't use it to fight but still won, there will be crazy agendas like 'the limitless is so complex, even Sukuna knew and couldn't use the 10S to deal with it' and we'll start seeing some absurd infinity+UV scaling cross verse, and no one will be able to provide a good counter argument. But with what happened, it just showed us limitless is still a CT, no matter how complex it is, Maho just needed 4 spins to adapt fully to it. Kinda omega busted.",
            "I feel like  the fight would have been received a lot better if there was just a small extra thing to show gojos Death, Honestly if they had cut kusakabes speech bubble in half while he said gojo wins it would have been better, or the entire manga page having a line through it, (as he cut the world)",
            "I agree. Does that mean mahoraga was made specifically for Sukuna to fight Gojo on down the road?",
            "And yet the fight was still massively underwhelming because it ended out of nowhere. An unsatisfying conclusion sours the whole thing.\n\nThe middle part of the battle where Gojo was fighting against both Sukuna and Mahoraga was fluid and interesting. The problems arise in that, after the climax of the fight where a cool move puts the whole thing in Gojo's favour, we don't restart the momentum with the multiple gamechanging moves in Sukuna's arsenal we just cut to Gojo dead. Sukuna's can now bypass Infinity but he's effectively lost the ten shadows, they're both domainless and Sukuna still has a reincarnation in reserve that should be the start of the second cllimax of the fight, not the abrupt end. If Sukuna's way to bypass infinity which didn't instantly kill and let the fight continue to a more satisfying death for Gojo there would be 1000x less complaints.",
            "Hien sukuna without 10S would still beat gojo.",
            "Of course, HOWEVER, I expected Sukuna to have something in his own arsenal that could possibly bypass the limitless and Gege could have done that easily. \n\nWe never knew anything about Sukuna\u2019s CT aside from the slashing and the fire, Gege literally had the freedom to add another power to Sukuna\u2019s arsenal and it wouldn\u2019t be asspull. Also we never knew what Kamutoke and Hiten were supposed to do, so either of these tools could\u2019ve been a counter to the infinity. I always thought that Sukuna might had a CT or even cursed tool to bypass the limitless himself.",
            "big facts",
            "Well, yeah, and Gojo would've won.",
            "Heian Sukuna would have just won the fight in the domain battles.",
            "My best argument was always this:\n\n1- Gojo with his ultimate defense technique is slightly stronger than Sukuna just because of Hax. If we take the fight to the end, most probably the DE battles would have been the same, with exception to the first two where Sukuna could have burned Gojo, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily means he wins. \n\nThen if both of them lose their DEs, then the fight still continues the same, Gojo chases Sukuna, Sukuna fights back with DA and RCT, until the battle of attrition turns into a case where either Infinity is very easily suppressed, cannot be controlled automatically but still stays on (can\u2019t block everything essentially, since that\u2019s how it works by identifying different things and blocking accordingly automatically), or Gojo has to keep switching between Neutral, Blue, Red, and Purple. \n\nIn this specific scenario, the fight is essentially the same, given that in a DE Sukuna still can\u2019t use his CT to hit Gojo, since his Neutral would have been on, and post-DE, since Gojo kept chasing Sukuna and couldn\u2019t do excessive damage before the adaptation, then it would have likely continued like this forever, until fatigue strikes both fighters, and then the fight becomes on an equal scale. \n\n2- Sukuna with his ultimate attack is slightly stronger than Gojo - unless it is used abruptly with a BV that helps in making it hit; in this case Sukuna is massively stronger, because really if you have an attack that can bypass the strongest defense, then naturally that Hax overrules yours, and puts you on a lower scale. In this scenario, and let\u2019s imagine Gojo does not get ambushed, and while the attack does appear to be excessively hard to do anything against, it has pre-requisites and can be seen by Gojo. So in case he can avoid it once, then the scale goes back from Sukuna massively stronger than Gojo, to only slightly. \n\nBut even with all that, imo Gojo still remains slightly stronger than the King of Curses given the fact that this ultimate attack is non-existent in scenarios without the TS. Meaning we go back to ground zero, where if both lose their DE, it becomes a battle of attrition and luck, and where one wins the DE, then that battle was a battle of luck mixed with ultimate skill\u2026\n\nHope that makes sense. But tbh, with all that\u2019s happening, I think it\u2019s all to point out just how massively strong both Sukuna and Gojo are. Any person that is considered at the top of the power scale, or the strongest of strongest, regardless of who we are talking about, they are always a grade or two lower than the enlightened ones.",
            "No Sukuna was not trying holding back even tough he had to run a gauntlet, why would u hold back if you're running a gauntlet ? He obviously wanted to upgrade his CT cuz it's within his character to almost die mid fight like an idiot even tough Sukuna's plan ended in 230 when he got brain damadge and had to improvise with Mahoraga",
            "True. It's just a bit unsatisfying that we never really got to see if gojo was right when he said \"nah I'd win\". Because that statement was about Sukuna without Mahoraga. Alll we can do now is speculating.",
            "\n\n\nTRULY hilarious thing is how Gojo agenda is literally \n\n\"NOOO YOU CAN'T INCREASE YOUR STRENGTH, YOU HAVE TO BE OP FROM BIRTH WITH PRETTY EYES AND STUPID HAX\"",
            "I understand what you are trying to say. Gege had huge expectations to fill for the final fight and ending the battle with just domains seems reasonable but boring. Since domain is the peak of jujutsu and it makes sense you defeat anyone with it alone mostly. So using ten shadows spiced up the fight and kept it interesting. In that sense it is logical.\n\nMy personal opinion is that the ending of the fight was disappointing. As a sukuna fan, WCS was a huge power up and it definitely didn't suit the power system. It can't be properly defended and causes a lot of inconsistency. An alternative way for bypassing the limitless would have been better in my opinion. Like a modified domain amplification that diverts the CT that it comes in contact with instead of simply bypassing it. This technique is customised for only the neutral infinity, thus a binding vow is formed. \n\nThis would extend the fight a little further, ending with sukuna using this special type of domain amplification which he learned from mahoraga's first adaptation which he then modified to be able to use it himself. Sukuna can use his CT while keeping it active and pass through neutral infinity and defeat gojo. Though it can divert neutral infinity, it can't divert red or blue. This makes it balanced and interesting to use and end the fight with.",
            "> People act like Sukuna using Mahoraga is fraudulent\n\nPeople are just biased in general, same with Malenia using Scarlet Aeonia, as if Radahn would actually call her a cheater or some shit. \n\nIts a deathmatch baby, you should use every tool at your disposal.",

            "\"Mahoraga is necessary to make the fight entertaining\" and \"Sukuna is a fraud because he had to steal Mahoraga to stand a chance\" are not contradicary statements.\n\nOne is about how an action is good for the narrative the other is about how an action changes the perception of a character. It doesn't even make Sukuna weak it makes him smart but that is a change in his overwhelming portrayal.",
            "I don't know how anyone expected Gojo to win, for the story to move forward and Yuji to eventually beat Sukuna's ass (unless Gege's fucks that up), Gojo had to lose. Kenjaku jumping in and saving Sukuna, which wouldn't be plausible as Gojo could just beat him quickly as well, wouldn't serve any good purpose",
            "Holy shit keep cooking",
            "Megukuna without 10s would've won against gojo. Actually every form of sukuna would've won against gojo. \n\nGojo managed to damage megukuna without DA enough in 3min to have a stalemate. Because of all the damage he managed to hit megukuna with UV. \n\nMegukuna without DA = punching bag for Gojo ( megukuna can't touch gojo BC of infinity)\n\nMegukuna with DA is equal to gojo h2h( meaning gojo will need way longer than 3min to damage sukuna enough to destroy his domain) but sukuna already destroys Gojo domain in 3min . So gojo loses every domain, and won't be able to hit sukuna with UV. \n\nIf gojo managed to survive all those domains he lost ( which I doubt) he will be finished when his brain is damaged from RCT in 230.",

            "Sukuna was absolutely holding back with the intention of upgrading himself. However his plan backfired and that's why those near death situations happen. If his plan had worked the fight would have been over by ch 230, but sukuna would not have had brain damage, would have mahoraga and the 10S and the space slash on top.",

To say Gojo is stronger than Sukuna is fine, it's your opinion, no one's gonna change your mind, even your Gojo and Gege tried and couldn't do that lol, but to say Sukuna isn't holding back, or hasn't been, is kinda crazy \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

He waited to take over Megumi(after analysing Ten Shadows) from the beginning and after witnessing Mahoraga, taking over Megumi became even more of a wet dream for Sukuna. \n\nIt's sad that the skill showcased by Sukuna is overlooked by people calling him fraudulent for taking over Megumi.",

            "There are ways to write around this. Gojo could've defeated Sukuna and still ended up dead, incapacitated or heavily nerfed (maybe due to binding vow?), so he's not able to full solve everything. \n\nThe conditions for the merger could've been different for it to seem more attainable by Kenjaku and make him seem as much of a threat as Sukuna for the rest of the cast to deal with. Heck, maybe even now there could be a loophole that allows it to happen without having to kill everyone, so maybe not even that would have to be done. \n\nAnd I'm not saying that this is necessarily better, it's just that I disagree with the idea that Gojo had to lose for the story to still be tense and exciting.",
            "I still think it's cheap we weren't shown how Gojo lost. \n\nI accept he had to lose to move the story forward, but I would have preferred to *actually see* Sukuna beat him and not just be told \"it's done, w/e\".\n\nGege probably wanted us and him to have the cake and eat it too. Let the fans believe for a sweet moment their favorite character pulled out a victory.... and then move the story forward.",
            "Keep in mind, Sukuna was holding a hostage just by being inside Megumi. The fight could have played with a more emotional angle, make Gojo reminisce a bit about his adoptive son (and not forget about him in the midst of battle). Instead of Sukuna eyeballing OP techniques it'd be him negotiating with Gojo for Mebumi's release through an equivalent binding vow.",

            "Are you seriously comparing this f\u2019d up sukuna who has killed Gojo and run the gauntlet nonstop, lost his tongue and arms, a damaged brain & significantly reduced CE to a fully healthy heian body sukuna.. just delete your comment and try again",
            "His plan was never to improve, he wanted Mahoraga to disable UV so he could then trap Gojo in a Barriered MS which was his plan up until 230. Until \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udca5",

            "That's right. But I still want to know if he was right at first.",
            "Sukuna learned this a bit from seeing how mahoraga's adaptation interacts with neutral infinity and how neutral infinity interacts with other things during the fight.\n\nWell a DA that works on only neutral infinity is powerful but it is also vulnerable to red and blue, even weak ones. Once gojo realizes this, he would create some distance and start launching red and blue or close in and start spamming blue reinforced punches. So it is reasonable in that sense besides neutral infinity it doesn't block any other CT or extensions of the same CT.",
            "To add another thing, Sukuna also saw the potential of the reincarnation to be used as a full body heal by not completing the process. Gojo's undeniably strong because he is a genius combined with having the completely busted combination of Six Eyes + Limitless, but there's something more... satisfying in Sukuna's strength. He has a mid CT, but it's his understanding of jujutsu, his thinking outside the box and creativity that makes him a complete menace.\n\nSukuna's domain is the perfect example. The sure-hit is very basic, but it's the King of Curses' skill in barrier techniques that makes Malevolent Shrine almost impossible to overcome in a normal domain clash. Sukuna's domain barrier is not only open (called an impossible feat, a divine technique), but he also adds the targetting system to it as well having Dismantle attack anything with no CE while Cleave kills anything with cursed energy. Compare that to Gojo's... who literally has a seperate special attack he can only use inside his domain that at minimum can stun someone... and at maximum could makes your brain into a mush. Satoru himself commented when he lost the 1st domain clash and got sliced up that his sure-hit is much better than Sukuna's.\n\nAnother interesting thing to compare is Gojo and Sukuna's ultimate attacks. Gojo only has to combine Red and Blue to produce the insanely powerful Hollow Purple. Sukuna on the other hand has the fire arrow that had incredible firepower, but is slow and has small range, so he improved it with a binding vow. On top of that he combines it with his domain, displays his skill in barrier techniques once again by closing his domain to anything but humans and creates an air tight space. Then he charges the debree with an explosive-like CE and explodes everything by releasing the fire arrow, creating series of explosions, shock waves, compression and decompression that annihilates anything in range. I mean... if people can't see how that attack is a testimant on what level Sukuna's brain works on when it comes to jujutsu... I don't know what to say.\n\nAnd as to the main point of the TS technqiue... for me it was an obvious display of how skilled Sukuna is. People always look at it the wrong way. I always see it from the angle that Sukuna took over Megumi and in just a month of having TS pushed it to its maximum potential (as far as we know) and competed with the strongest Six Eyes + Limitless user who's mastered his CT to near perfection. I always say this... if TS is soooo busted and Sukuna got so very carried by it then give it to Kenjaku, Yuta or Yuki and throw them against Gojo, surely they'd do as good as Sukuna, no? I can guarantee you they wouldn't last a minute. People just have a hard time accepting that yes, TS has great potential, but it was because Sukuna was the one wielding it that it was possible to realize said potential. Mahoraga was just a suicide move for a TS user before Sukuna for a reason.",
            "Put the part where some how sukuna could hurt yuji is top tier bs though",
            "No proof he was immediately capable of fighting after the bomb. Also he completely lost all sense of self. In no way is that a win",
            "And Radahn was too insane to finish her off, making it a perfect draw. Being technically capable of fighting doesnt mean shit if youre too stupid to actually kill your enemy. \n\nAnd unlike Radahn, Malenia actually got even stronger after that fight.",
            "A scene where Gojo and Sukuna agree to some sort of binding vow where Megumi is free but Sukuna gets his full body would be great, if it involved Gojo being outsmarted somehow. Much more satisfying than the narrator simply telling us all of Sukuna\u2019s vows\u00a0",

            ">but could Gojo manage to break Sukuna's domain before the 3 minutes?\n\nNobody can break Sukuna's open domain since there's no barrier to break. For the domain to 'crumble' Gojo had to fight Sukuna and injure/hurt him to an extent that he couldn't maintain his domain.",
            "That\u2019s incorrect. Sukuna didn\u2019t need to get beaten up, he just needed time to pass for Mahoraga\u2019s adaptation through Megumi\u2019s soul\u00a0",
            "True that's fair.",
            "Not really. The adaptation was on megumi. He didnt need to get beaten up, he just needed to use domain amp enough to stop getting beaten up, and even that proved very difficult",
            "Not exactly. He wanted to adapt thats why even after Gojo's supposed defeat he still went for mahoraga adaption to infinity. Mahoraga adapting to UV was removing cards from the hand, but not the goal of mahoraga.",

He said, even after fighting him for 13 chapters, after getting his back in the corner multiple times, with 3 clear cut chances to win, he still CAN'T envision himself winning against a king of Curses who had no Megumi, a humbling statement that left even his best friend shocked. I don't know how you read that and thought Gojo said Sukuna definitely went all out. But hey, that's just my perception, Gege,Gojo and I might be wrong, who knows \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

            "Im stealing the guys role here but eh, basically heres the deal.\n\nIn the original fight, the domain clashes ended in a draw. Gojo couldnt use his domain anymore because he restored it too often with RCT. Sukuna on the other hand couldnt use it because he was hit by Unlimited Void. Meaning if Sukuna was never hit by Unlimited Void, he could open his domain, close his barrier and trap Gojo inside. It was stated multiple times in the fight that Gojo cant survive for a long time in MS, only for a short period.\n\nNow, how did Gojo hit Unlimited Void? Simple, he damaged Sukuna to a point he couldnt maintain his domain, then, while Sukuna was busy healing himself from his injuries, Gojo opened up his domain, giving him the advantage.\n\nAgainst Heian Era Sukuna this never happens. Heian Sukuna \n\n1. Isnt playing defensively during the clashes for Mahoragas adaptation -> he always uses DA\n\n2. He is physically more capable than Meguna\n\n3. He has 4 arms for Hand to hand\n\nGojo BARELY managed to break Megunas domain in 3 minutes, against Heian Era Sukuna with these conditions, he will never pull it off. Sukuna will always break Gojos domain first. This will end with Gojo being surprised by the sudden wave of slashes, giving Sukuna the time to heal up all his injuries, putting Gojo back to square one.\n\nThe fight goes on like the original, Gojo loses his ability to use DE after the fifth clash. Sukuna keeps it and the scenario I presented takes place.",

It's also kinda related that we don't know don't even know what is Sukuna sacrifing for his BV. Like what, now he can't eat cereals but can use his DE with only one hand sign? Cool, but at least lmk.",
            "The issue with that statement about Sukuna not going all out is that it makes no sense from what we where shown, which was Sukuna straining his powers so badly that he gave himself literal brain damage, very nearly dying more then once, and then after the battle he was in such a bad shape that he's been getting whittled down and more then likely soon to be beaten by sorcerers far weaker then him\n\nI can respect the narrative idea of making sukuna the real strongest and making him all badass and cool \"Hes so awesome he doesn't have to go all out even against the strongest sorcerer of the modern age\" but Gege could at least have tried showing that a bit better in the actual fight instead of just making gojo randomly say it at the very end. so i cant really blame people for arguing about it after so long",

If Radahn was in a condition to just go up and still be capable of fighting and finishing off Malenia, why didn't he just kill Finlay, when she was taking her away? The two must have been in close proximity after all, since Malenia nuked Radahn, while basically standing on him, according to that one trailer, so it's not like Finlay was picking her up at some safe distance, with Radahn too far away to do anything.",

He can also use Hollow Wicker Basket while still having arms to fight.\n\nGojo literally wonders why Sukuna didn't blow apart Gojo's new domain from the inside with dismantle and it's because he was using 10S which he wouldn't be here.

            "that statement alone cause majority of the Gojo fandom to cream their pants. Their GOAT had the advantage, and was 'beating' fear into the so called 'strongest sorcerer in history'? what more could they ask for? In hindsight, yes, people will be mad about anything, but if you go back and ask a gojo fan if he'll ever like gege to put that statement into the fight, the answer will be unanimous: Yes. Sukuna seemingly scared was a perfect way to hype up Gojo, and as a sukuna fan, I want that over any other iteration of their fight. At least in this version of the fight, Gojo fans have an infinite (just 13 lol) chapters of slander and memes to get at sukuna fans, Sukuna fans have one chapter to clap back, just like infinity vs WS, a perfect balance. \n\n  \nWe know what he sacrificed. To miantain shibuya level domain in range on top of being incomplete, his domain could only last 99 seconds. Now against yuta, he doesn't need to maintain the range, erasing the bindig vow of a time limit. Remember, on top of being an open barrier domain Sukuna maximizes his advanatage by making binding vows to increase shrines output past it's peak (at 200 metres), whenever he shrinks the domain. So if his domain has it's highest output at 200 metres, it goes higher, whenever he shrinks his domain. The binding vow is just to take advantage of the fact that he CAN shrink his domain, it (binding vow) doesn't shrink it for him.\n\n  \nThe modified hand sign wasn't included as part of the binding vow Sukuna made, till it will be specifically stated at least. The main assumption will just be of his ability to copy any application of Jujutsu he's theoretically capable of doing himself, since he's capable of modifying his hand signs, he did, after seeing Gojo's own. How far back as to when he might have copied it, we don't know. He might have even copied it when Gojo purposefully showed him everything about his domain against Jogo.",
            "But that wouldn't have created the hype around Gojo losing as much as it would have. Gege had the option of feeding Gojo fans what they wanted-Gojo looking like the G.O.D of JJK in that fight-because he always had the option of saying Sukuna wasn't going all out in his back pocket, and he took it. Not only did that create so much strong positive emotions in the minds of Gojo fans (till 236), but it prepared the stage for those strong emotions to turn to pure hate, which Gege wanted.\n\nIf Gege had made it fair battle, and Sukuna defeated him by overpowering him, Gojo will lose A LOT of fans, and I mean a lot. 'We are loved because we are strong': Sukuna, he was also talking about the fans to. Granted Gojo is more than just his strength, but the core of it all is still his strength. Gege understood the likes and dislikes of the fanbase of his most popular character, and he COOKED them a 10 star buffet.\n\nBut ultimately, Gege needed to continue his train of treating villians bad. He treated Mahito dirty, he treated Kenny dirty, and he's prepping the stage to treat Sukuna the dirtiest, and he's taken the first step: Garner enough hatred on him so that when he's taken out, it will only be pure hate and slander he receives. There are no redeeming arcs for villians in JJK, they all get treated like shit, and all we have for them after their death is slander. I must say, I haven't seen it any other type of manga, this is the first for me.\n\nI always imagine it like a football game. I am going to play the best player of this gen, + 10+ people, and finally an AI specifically created by the devs to wipe the floor with any human being. And after every match, my health bar stays the same way it is, everyone else has the chance to have fresh health bars against me.\n\nI have the advantage of having a star player (messi) on my team, the best player has (best keeper), and only God knows what players the AI has.\n\nWe begin playing and ronaldo hits the crossbar 3 times in the match, scaring me on the third one, as the match only remains 5 minutes. , At the last minute, With all my defenses stripped, when he's on the counter, I find the whole in his defense I've been looking for all game, and I scored with messi through that just before the final whistle.\n\nBut then fans of the best player watching the match say I cheated, I shouldn't have had messi, it's not fair that the best player had the most possession, hit the bar3 times and still lost, but then he (the best player), says I was holding back and he frankly doesn't think he would have won even if I didn't have Messi. Obviously his fans will disagree because they watched the game from a particular lens, but the best player played the game, and understood the intricacies of the game and the real quality of the game at which I played at that the fans couldn't see or feel.\n\nThere goes me ranting again \ud83d\ude16",

            "I hate to break it to you buddy, but in the japanse chapter, Sukuna used the kanji \u7121\u9650\u306e when talking about adapting, which is only used when talking about the Limitless-Technique, NOT infinity by itself, so what it actually said is that Sukuna will adapt to limitless while he carves Gojo to pieces",

Are they explained? No. You literally can't form an opinion on it. You just have to accept it.\n\nBtw i was referring to the part against maki and Yuji and Yuta. He does some stuff that can only be explained by him making continous binding vows. But since they are not stated, that's it.\n\nOn top of that, afawk, Sukuna can do that bc he is Sukuna. Nothing more, nothing less. Ik we will know why he is so strong, but that time must be near, bc it's becoming frustrating.\n\n\nAt the end for me it feels like Gege is pushing it to sell more copies. It's probably not even their fault, it's how the market works, but damn",
            "I don't find it farfetched, how right after being nuked, he would enter into a critical condition, which would be rapidly deteriorating, until his Great Rune kicked in, halted the rot's advance and gave him leeway to (eventually) stabilize.\n\nHis rune's description states: \"The Great Rune burns, to resist the encroachment of the scarlet rot.\", so it's not like he's just left there to be devoured from inside by the rot, but it's actively being suppresed by his rune.",

His chance to him them again like that is extremely low, and if he does get hit, Heian Sukuna is physically more durable than Meguna and is permanently using DA, he can reduce the damage of Red to some extent. Gojo gave his all to beat up a Meguna who played defensively for Mahoraga and he took 3 minutes. This is a fact shown clearly in the fight. Against a Heian Sukuna who is\n\nA. Not playing defensively for Mahoraga (meaning he uses DA all the time)\n\nB. Is physically more capable \n\nC. Has 4 arms for Hand To Hand combat\n\nHe just wont be able to pull it off",
            "TLDR: \u7121\u9650 refers to \"Infinity\", which is the neutral form of Limitless. Go back to Satoru's first fight with Jogo and you'd see that that's how he explains \"Infinity\". The word used for Satoru's Cursed Technique, Limitless, is \u7121\u4e0b\u9650, so your interpretation in that specific line isn't correct.\n\nShishiso's(previous members of TCB) translator's note regarding the use of \u7121\u9650:\n\nT/N: \u201cNeutral Limitless\u201d is Gojo\u2019s inviolable space \u201cInfinity\u201d. \u201cBlue\u201d is a reinforced \u201cInfinity\u201d.    \n  \nSide Note: Actually, the term \u7121\u9650 (infinity) is used in JJK either as a synonym/short for Gojo\u2019s \u7121\u4e0b\u9650\u546a\u8853 (limitless) or to refer to the concept of infinity itself. \u7121\u9650 (infinity) is not an established term in JJK nomenclature that refers to Gojo's inviolable space or neutral \u201climitless\u201d. Jogo used to call Gojo's inviolability \u201cinfinity\u201d, in which case it falls under the first category of being a synonym/short for \u201c(neutral) limitless\u201d. In the same sense, \u4e0d\u53ef\u4fb5 (inviolability) is also not an established term in JJK nomenclature. Both \u201cinviolability\u201d and \u201cinfinity\u201d are just common nouns that can be used to refer to Gojo's neutral \u201climitless\u201d depending on how they are phrased. These are some of the occasions where the term \u201cinfinity\u201d were used:  \n  \n(1) The inviolable space created with the power of \u201cinfinity\u201d. (In the Fanbook)  \n  \n(2) The barrier that manifests infinity and prevents contact. (In the Fanbook)  \n  \n(3) I just bring infinity into reality. (During Jogo vs Gojo)  \n  \n(4) The \u201cinfinity\u201d between you and me. (During Jogo vs Gojo)  \n  \nBut none of the above indicates that \u201cinfinity\u201d is an established JJK term, especially since many of them are not put under quotation marks. It's just used as a common noun (with some emphasis on some using quotation marks) here to refer to the concept of infinity that Gojo can bring forth into reality.  \n  \nBut since the English Fandom is already treating \u201cinfinity\u201d as an established JJK term referring to Gojo\u2019s neutral \u201climitless\u201d or inviolable space, then we're just going to do the same too.",

        "content": "A common line in other subreddits is \"I refuse to believe that Higuruma didn't encounter at least one cursed tool user\" or \"How did Higuruma not train with at least one cursed tool user during the month timeskip?\" \n\nHowever, I find this pretty easy to believe, based on the following pieces of evidence:\n\n1. There are very few existing cursed tools that already existed within the Culling Game barriers.\n -  No Culling Game colonies were created over the locations of known Cursed Tool stockpiles. \n - Kenjaku lost control of Juzo Kimiya's stockpile, as [Maki was able to access the workshop and take a tool from it.](https://i.imgur.com/0NUVSpu.png)\n - [The Zenin clan has a stockpile of cursed tools, and it was destroyed by Zenin Ogi in Perfect Preparation.](https://i.imgur.com/0NUVSpu.png)\n - Jujutsu High has a stockpile of Cursed Objects in general, due to Jujutsu Society wanting to centralise all cursed objects for safeguarding. This stockpile [may be tied to the Kamo clan](https://i.imgur.com/zTFCqo6.png), due to the fact that the Death Painting Wombs were likely property of the Kamo clan, but are stored in the Jujutsu High stockpile.\n - No colony was created in these locations.\n - Cursed tools worth their while are rare, and expensive as a result: Playful Cloud costs [500 million yen in 2018](https://i.imgur.com/gcpSj1Q.png), which is 4,560,600USD ($5,701,321.82 today, accounting for inflation of USD), at a bare minimum. This is a cursed tool that does not have a cursed technique. \n -  Even though Kenjaku has control of the Kamo clan stockpile, Kenjaku does not have any reason to distribute weapons to the Culling Game players. This achieves nothing. \n - Of the confirmed Cursed Tools that originate in the Colonies, two are part of the operation of a Cursed Technique: [Charles' staff fills with ink as his technique progresses, and is used to initiate his technique.](https://i.imgur.com/rnoKnhE.png) Higuruma's Mallet [is created by his technique](https://i.imgur.com/iZiYo2c.png), and becomes the Executioner's Sword. Kashimo's staff is a religious object, and isn't confirmed to be a Cursed Tool, and shows no indication of being one.\n - If a Cursed Tool is part of a Cursed Technique, then confiscating either the Cursed Tool or Cursed Technique would have the same result, and may in fact be the same thing. \n - Unlike the reincarnated sorcerers, the Cursed Spirits are not reincarnated into human bodies, but had formed contracts with Kenjaku, and retained their possessions. Kurorushi pulls a sword out of his body. It may be part of Kurorushi's Cursed Technique, but if it isn't, then it has retained it from prior to the start of the Culling Game.\n - Reincarnated sorcerers are incarnated into the bodies of ordinary people, who do not have Cursed Tools.\n2. Cursed tools are not easy to create.\n - We've only seen three people explicitly capable of creating Cursed Tools that extend beyond repeated use: [Juzo Kimiya](https://i.imgur.com/mGnI2im.png), [Zenin Mai](https://i.imgur.com/Ze086zC.png), and [Yorozu](https://i.imgur.com/CJqHc5I.png). Note that the last two individuals were only able to create high tier Cursed Tools by sacrificing their life.\n - Tools created via repeated use take more than several years to create: In Miwa vs Maki, Gege notes that Miwa's sword is a ['sorta-cursed tool' created from repeated cursed energy infusion](https://i.imgur.com/oYzIn4E.png). Miwa's sword is broken by Kenjaku with his bare hands. Nanami's Cleaver is another example of a cursed tool created through repeated use, over a longer period of time than Miwa, [but it was only a cursed tool after his death.](https://i.imgur.com/8hphe6G.png)\n4. For many sorcerers, there are reasons not to use Cursed Tools.\n - Modern Jujutsu society has a taboo against the use of weapons overall, which extends to Cursed Tools: Part of the reason for the heavy discrimination against Toji and Maki was because they *needed* to use Cursed Tools. [Naoya looks down on the other Zenin clan members for needing weapons, while pointing this fact out.](https://i.imgur.com/02Bwf45.png) The re-incarnated sorcerers are believed to have [a mindset that revolves around strength and battle.\n](https://i.imgur.com/EqqhHkd.png) It's likely they may have a similar form of taboo.\n - Cursed Tools require weapon training to use effectively, and most Jujutsu High sorcerers involved in the Culling Games only appear to have rudimentary weapons training at best.\n - Many have fighting styles that a weapon is unaccommodating to, such as Yuji and Todo. Using a Cursed Tool would require a total change in how they operate.\n - [Naoya's reasoning behind the taboo is sound: if you disarm a sorcerer who is wholly reliant on their weapon, or break their weapon, they will be helpless.](https://i.imgur.com/QdDnIqr.png)\n - [Against a Cursed Spirit of a significantly lower power than Sukuna, a blow from a Grade 1 sorcerer using a powerful Special Grade Cursed Tool on a weak spot was not sufficient to kill it.](https://i.imgur.com/coTGD7G.png) Even if the tool is worthwhile to use generally, it may not be useful enough to use against Sukuna.\n\n4. Higuruma has no reason to use his domain on a Cursed Tool or weapons user during the timeskip.\n - Maki is immune to his Domain.\n - There's no real training Higuruma can do with Ino, beyond casual sparring, Using his Domain on Ino would not achieve anything.\n - Mei Mei is a weapons user, but it's unknown if her weapon is a Cursed Tool, and she isn't the type to casually spar. Her contribution to training has been enabling switch training.\n - Yuta's sword likely isn't a Cursed Tool, given that he frequently breaks it. His other Cursed Tools aren't relevant to the plan, so he has no need to train with them.\n - Kashimo's staff probably isn't a Cursed Tool, and Higuruma has nothing to gain from training with Kashimo. Kashimo doesn't seem like the type to particularly participate in the training.\n - Kusakabe's sword likely isn't a Cursed Tool. The school of which he is a student is focused on allowing sorcerers who are disadvantage to succeed ('A domain for the weak'). It makes no sense for him to be reliant on a Cursed Tool, and he is able to respond [to his sword breaking by the use of one of his school's techniques.](https://i.imgur.com/XDQdDMO.png)\n - The other sorcerers who don't use weapons already have no reason to start to do so. Their time is better spent refining their skills or overcoming their weaknesses, rather than trying to pick up the effective use of a weapon (a skill that can take several years).\n\nSo, given that Cursed Tools are rare and mostly monopolised by Jujutsu society, it is unlikely that among the 20 sorcerers that Higuruma fought to gain 100 points, any of them had a Cursed Tool. Even if he did fight a Cursed Tool user, it may be that he did not need to use his Domain against them, as the type of sorcerer who is overly reliant on their Cursed Tool is likely one insufficiently skilled to take on Higuruma. During the 1 month time skip, he had no real reason to use his Domain on anyone who uses a Cursed Tool. In addition, sorcerers do not inherently know how their technique works. As of such, it is very easy for Higuruma to have never encountered anyone with a Cursed Tool, and not know this oddity of his technique, given how few battles he has fought, and the conditions they took place in.",

            "Honestly all it would've taken to make the convenience of the plot point better was to show Sukuna actually planning things out.\n\nCurrently Sukuna feels very passive in that encounter, i.e. it felt like he had no agency in what was confiscated and lucked into a situation that neither he nor Higuruma expected.\n\nIf instead Sukuna had monologued about how he saw the domain from inside Yuji, speculated about what would happen if there were multiple cursed techniques in the domain during the confiscation, figured out a Cursed Weapon with a CT imbued would count as a valid target for confiscation, and asked Uraume to drop off Kamutoke after his battle with Gojo, then it would play much better.\n\nWe'd have bought it. He's shown to be obsessive about figuring out the limits of CTs and he has shown himself to be unparalleled in Jujutsu knowledge with the exception of maybe Gojo.\n\nYou could maybe even throw some banter about Yorozu and her love being worthless in there as he sacrifices the cursed weapon.\n\nWithout agency the situation feels contrived because you can almost see the hand of the author carve a path for Sukuna to overcome specific situations.",

            "Good post but there\u2019s one thing I saw your confused about. In general, a cursed tool is just any weapon that has been infused with cursed energy consistently. Which means that any weapon a prominent sorcerer is wielding is most definitely a cursed tool. Nanami\u2019s blunt blade (while he was alive), Mei Mei\u2019s axe, Yuta\u2019s katana\u2019s are all cursed tools because cursed tools are literally just tools imbued with CE for a while\n\nAnything Maki wields before her power up is also most definitely a cursed tool, since she isnt capable of controlling cursed energy in the first place, all her weapons have been imbued with a decent amount of CE. This means that there are probably dozens if not more of readily available cursed tools for sorcerers to use in the storehouse",
            "I don't care. I just wanted to see sukuna beat everyone without his technique and show them that it doesn't matter what tricks they pull he's still leagues above them.

            "The fact that Higurama only found out during his fight with Yuji that he can also confiscate Cursed Energy should have prompted him to experiment with Domain Expansion more. The sorcerers should clearly be aware that not even Higurama knows the true workings of his CT so they should have started thinking what else his domain was capable of and trying it during the preparations.",
            "Good legwork dude. Great read. Agree with you. When I first read the chapter where it doesn't take sukunas technique, I was surprised yeah, but it kinda made sense at the same time.

            "OP, I get what you're trying to do here, and I hope this doesn't come across badly, but if I get a character setting of a \"genius lawyer\" who graduated from Toudai who's known for his intelligence, then I would really expect him to, I don't know, plan a little better? Unless he got his degree from [wish.com](http://wish.com), of course.\n\nThe HS group spent over a month making plans B, C, D in the event of Gojo's death (I have so many comments to say on this, but not the point here), but it's very...telling how most of these plans BCD just, naturally made a bunch of assumptions that they really shouldn't have made if you looked at things logically. Higuruma assuming that his CT would automatically take away inherent qualities such as CT or CE away from the judged, is really quite a huge reach, especially if, as you say, he's a new sorcerer who's supposed to be really really smart, who should've been aware of the limits of his knowledge regarding his own abilities. In fact, we see Higuruma planning for all the different crimes that they can use to charge Sukuna so they can get a definite conviction, but not his thinking about the limitations of his abilities. If he can have doubts about whether they can charge Sukuna successfully, shouldn't he have at least tested his own abilities then before assuming that this will be a surefire success?\n\nI'm sorry but it just doesn't really match up with the character setting. But like I said in a comment above, there's also not much I can do to complain against it, since Gege actually never said explicitly what Judgeman would take away. So of course he's free to fill in the blanks however he wishes, no matter how unsatisfying it can feel to the audience.\n\nEDIT: You also really shouldn't be using Playful Cloud as a basis of estimating the average cost of Cursed Tools, that's also a flawed assumption. We know that it's a Special Grade tool, but not every Cursed Tool is Special Grade. So assuming that all Cursed Tools, or the average cost of Cursed Tools, are all in the same ballpark of Playful Cloud doesn't really make much sense. \n\nAt the same time, I'm not sure why you're assuming that only \"worthwhile\" Cursed Tools would be confiscated. Based on what we know at this point, if used on Zenin Mai, it could very well confiscate one of her bullets. \"Worthwhile\" or not doesn't really, and shouldn't really factor into the equation.",
            "I think confiscating cursed tools is a 'hole' in Higuruma's cursed technique,a neccessary one.\n\nIf you think about it every cursed technique needs to have a weakness of some sort.\n\nTen Shadows-isolate and destroy the shikigami *pernamently*\nLimitless-insane CE consumption(without 6E),lots of destruction,hard to fight alongside others\nRestless Gambler-can kill the user in the domain,can take advantage of the punch and kick heal merchant state depending on your abilities\nCopy-5 minutes time limit for Yuta,low cursed technique count(without Rika)\nBlood manipulation-water,user needs constant refills of blood\n\nThis seems to be the case for Higuruma too,cursed tools are a way to fight against his CT.",
            "Thanks for this, I feel like I'm losing my mind every time people talk about the confiscation on Jujutsufolk. I could never fathom why people were so fucking worked up about it. It's not like the trial failed in any way, he still got the ES and the death penalty from his domain. Did they just want him to one shot Sukuna and end the fight right there with zero stakes whatsoever? We all knew Sukuna wasn't going down that easily, I was stoked to see Gege subverting the expectation of how it would happen (considering the popular fan theory at the time was Sukuna out-lawyering them at the trial somehow and ass-pulling his way out of the death penalty). Not to mention they would have been fucking COOKED if he still had Kamutoke since they had no way of countering that like Kashimo. I also couldn't care less that we never really got to see it in action, I'd much rather see the Sukuna we know and love using C/D than some lightning tool that just showed up. \n\nReading comprehension/awareness of good writing curse strikes again",
            "Agree with everything you say but also want to point out: why does everyone act like Sukuna losing his cursed tool is a bad thing? Yeah he\u2019s a badass without it but we would not be where we\u2019re at right now if he still had that thing. Getting punched down by Yuji? He could just lightning bolt him to death easily, it was VITAL that Sukuna loses that cursed tool.

Say Higuruma does know beforehand, what changes in their plan?\n\n- Doesn\u2019t even really convenience or help Sukuna like people argue.

            "TL;DR not having anyone to test on is a good reason not to know for certain. Not having any of our smart and experienced group consider the possibility when they have had nothing else to focus on for a month is the oart (at least for me) that seems like a stretch.\n\nI think the best argument is that they wouldnt know that Sukuna might have a tool, but given they had a month and nothing else to ponder on i find it hard to believe that they didnt consider the possibility.\n\nOn your first two points (scarcity and taboo) taboo was irrelevant at the skip as they all knowingly had the elders killed. Between Gojo and Ui Ui they had high level teleporters , theres very few locations they couldnt have reached. They did not need a powerful item, just any given cursed tool.\n\nYour third point is valid, not having someone available they *could* test on is a good reason not to know. They still could have discussed the possibility however - they have a large mix of extremely experienced and knowledgable sorcerers and a month to ask questions about abilities. \n\nTo believe the suprise at the cursed tool, we'd need to believe that no one in the group was curious enough or paranoid enough to ask Higurama about how his technique interacts with cursed tools.

Had to permanently hard nerf his newest, strongest ability just to be able to win against Gojo, making it much easier for fighters to see coming and actively avoid.  \n4.) Has lost both left arms making it effectively impossible to cast his domain normally, along with use the WCS at all.  \n5.) Is unable to heal at all as, even though he found the RCT circuit in his brain that Gojo used at the end of their fight, Yuji's punches and black flash rush made it more or less impossible for him.  \n6.) When casting a domain he had to limit its uptime just to maintain its damage output.\n\nAnd of course, while it happened much earlier, he did lose his cursed tool that aided him significantly against Kashimo (even though Kashimo gets low-diffed even without it).

Only when there's no CT will it confiscate the ability to use CE.\n\nGoing from that to the idea that Deadly Sentencing would prioritise Cursed Tools over CTs isn't unbelievable in the slightest and actually makes a lot of sense considering that Cursed Tools with a CT imbued literally allow a sorcerer to use a CT without spending their own CE, without using hand signs and chants, and the tool's efficiency isn't reduced even if the sorcerers output is lowered.\n\nAnd like, if anything what's convenient is the fact that Sukuna deliberately let's them pull him into Higurima's domain and confesses the crimes because he wants to see the executioner's sword.\n\nSukuna could have simply blitzed them all and donuted Higuruma the way he did Choso, avoiding the sword, and keeping his CT as well as Kamutoke.\n\nEven if Higuruma had confiscated Shrine Sukuna would have still folded them all, killed Higuruma, thus recovering Shrine, and then proceeded to keep folding everyone, this time wielding both Shrine and Kamutoke. And people then would complain about Higuruma doing nothing and Sukuna being too strong.",
            "I really would like this trend of \"this is logically consistent and that's why it's good\" to stop.\n\nThis is still a story to entertain, the issue with Sukuna during that stretch of the story was that he just got the best result out of every single tactic used by other character without him (seemingly) doing much.  \nIt may be logically consistent, but it's boring.  \nAnd that was the big criticism, everything else doesn't really matter and even that criticism is a matter of taste.\n\nLogically consistent storywriting is really not that important in the grand scheme of things, as long as a story is entertaining and interesting, an author can bend their fictional reality in canon-breaking ways without much trouble. Those things only matter when the story sucks.",
            "Hard to disagree with anything here, good job.",
            "I totally agree with your overall points, but some nitpicks I wanted to throw out there while going over everything: \n\n- Ogi didn\u2019t destroy the Zen\u2019in cursed tools, he just had them removed. Where he put them we still don\u2019t know, and presumably there was nothing in there better for Maki than SSK (which is easy enough to believe). \n\n- Kashimo\u2019s staff is almost certainly a cursed tool. It allows him to charge his CE into it and can be a source of a lighting bolt when he needs to make a connection between something other than his opponent to generate a charge. Kashimo didn\u2019t seem capable of just charging other items, I do believe strongly that this is an aspect of the staff that is a result of it being a cursed tool. Either way, it would be silly to think Higuruma would train against Kashimo of all people, so there\u2019s still no reason he would\u2019ve known about how his technique interacts with tools just yet.",
            "Literally read this and scrolled down twice to see a post in jujutsufolk that is about this exactly. And as you might guess it\u2019s filled with people agreeing about how much of an asspull it is",

Most of your points are *entirely* based on assumptions, some of them far and above more unlikely that others.

For that matter, there isn't reason given for why Gojo could heal his own RCT or how Sukuna could also do it just by seeing it's possible.\n\nI think the real underpining point is that there was no reason in the story Higu's domain had to have worked that way. It didn't matter for how the story progressed at all, on retrospect it just looks like an easy way to write out the cursed tool he now had without the cast having to deal with it. It was a variable in all this that blipped in and out of existence  for Sukuna to reincarnate, and even that's not been explained. Narratively, what was the point of it besides Giving sukuna so far unexplained outs? I'll take 'em if they come but there's no mystery or suspense in it.",

Lemme see what happens when we try Higu DE with some rare cursed tool from the chest the Zenin clan hid away before getting wiped by Maki.\" Yeah, they probably also lost that reserve of cursed tools cause I doubt Maki added another chore when she was busy cleaning house.\n\nAgree with your arguments.

Miwa's katana is described as a psuedo Cursed Tool, but also a cursed tool. We later see the language switch to 'special' cursed tools. IE, Yuta starts to worry about Yuji having a 'special' cursed tool, Yorozu is capable of creating 'special' cursed tools. It's probably items that carry a technique that are 'special cursed tools'. \n\n> This means that there are probably dozens if not more of readily available cursed tools for sorcerers to use in the storehouse\n\nOh, absolutely, there was, up until Gojo was sealed. Then Kamo and Zenin repossessed them (I link the panel a few times), and Zenin destroys their stockpile and Kamo's stockpile is under Kenjaku's control.",
            "You can't just use it for a while. Yuta's sword was broken by yuji, miwa's sword was broken from hittinh hanami, and kusakabe's sword was broken from hitting sukuna. On the other hand, megumi's sword (which was a legitimate cursed tool) didn't break from hitting hanami.\n\nMiwa at that time has used her sword for at least 2 years, and it was still just a \"pseudo cursed tool\" as stated by gege. That means that you need to imbue your weapon a lot to actually make it into a cursed tool.\n\nKenjaku says that the \"ritual\" of creating curse tools from the bath involves submerging toold into a solution of cursed energy for 10 months. That's 10 months of continuous imbueing with curse energy, when a sorcerer would imbue their weapon only while fighting (hence why nanami's tool is a cursed tool since he used it for about 12 years)",
            "but most of these common cursed tools wouldn\u2019t have techniques to confiscate, they\u2019re just charged with cursed energy \u2014 so even if higuruma tested it out, presumably mei mei\u2019s halberd wouldn\u2019t register for confiscation, for example",

            "This is a good statement towards the underpining reason why people get the misconception that Higuruma knew or should know how his domain works. It doesn't make any sense for him to not spend time thinking about that over a month while he does spend time thinking about which crimes to use for his 'case'. Especially not when he's such a legal prodigy. It's not just his intelligence but what he's intelligent in, this dude should and would be thinking of minor details obsessively.\n\nThe misconception and assumption is Higuruma knowing things intuitively. The reason people reach that conclusion is because it was a very unsatisfying sequence of events that ultimately lead to the unsatisfying end of Higu's story. There really was never an overall arc for him and his growth and death didn't do anything to propel characters or the story forward. His death had the same intention/feeling of Nanami's in passing things onto Yuji to finish, but none of the weight.\n\nA prodigy lawyer not even considering the limitations of his own understanding of his domain is out of character. That he discussed the Japanese legal system with everyone for planning but not one person questioned the specifics of his domain or asked to test anything is stupid.",
            "> At the same time, I'm not sure why you're assuming that only \"worthwhile\" Cursed Tools would be confiscated. Based on what we know at this point, if used on Zenin Mai, it could very well confiscate one of her bullets. \"Worthwhile\" or not doesn't really, and shouldn't really factor into the equation.\n\nI'm not. Worthwhile is a factor used to determine whether it is worth using. For many of the sorcerers we have, the difficulties that come with using a weapon aren't outweighed by the benefits that the weapon would bring, even if it's a cursed tool. \n\nI'm not using Playful Cloud as a basis for cursed tools as a whole. I'd use Demon Slaughter for that. It wasn't a big deal that Demon Slaughter went missing. It also isn't very powerful, which is why Gojo gave it to Yuji, so that he wouldn't grow reliant on it's power. \n\n> But if I get a character setting of a \"genius lawyer\" who graduated from Toudai who's known for his intelligence, then I would really expect him to, I don't know, plan a little better? Unless he got his degree from wish.com, of course.\n\nI think the point of this sequence is to show that intelligence and experience are a different ballgame. He has the raw talent of Gojo, and is smart to boot, but lacks experience, and that's why he fails. In fact, he literally says this: https://i.imgur.com/mwuhB6x.png\n\nThis is also a pretty common theme in Jujutsu Kaisen: people assume things, and they're wrong.

Knowing how to survive the deadliest Domain ever is a high priority for them, and mastering Simple Domain and RCT still wasn't easy, even for a genius. Higuruma never managed to get RCT in the timeskip, so probably more time was spent practising that than exploring the limits of his technique.",

I don't just think actually, I know, because yuta pretty much said so. \n\nThe low output nerf to sukuna would be petty much useless if sukuna kept kamutoke.  Sukuna didn't even care if shrine was taken away in the first place. He was ready to throw down without it. He  was capable of outspeeding a piercing blood and donutting choso before he even realised he disappeared. He avoided Yuji's  swing of the executioners blade at point blank range.

But he just didn't seem to have considered it entirely.\n\nDefinitely agree about Gege's trying to recreate the feeling of Nanami's death here. I think another part of why his death didn't hit as hard for me, is the fact that Higuruma had so little to do with any of the cast but Yuji, and even his interactions with Yuji were really limited and didn't really show us much of a bond. Meanwhile, Nanami's death for me hit harder, because Nanami is shown to have connections with other people in Jujutsu society (e.g. Ino, Shouko, Gojo, etc) so we can fill in the blanks on our own more of how his death may have impacted other people.",
            "But if Playful Cloud's cost isn't the average, and \"common\" Cursed Tools like Demon Slaughter are the norm, wouldn't there be more free floater Cursed Tools around? There's no reason to assume that the vast majority of Cursed Tools are only at stockpile locations, right? \n\nI get what you're trying to say here, with regards to experience v. intelligence, but like you said, which I also referred to, Higuruma knew from the very beginning of his appearance and from his encounter with Yuji to not be aware of the limits of his own technique. So why would he then repeat his mistake of keep assuming that he knows everything there is to know, especially since we see him planning with the HS school and not assuming that the crime they charge against Sukuna will surely work with Judgeman? \n\nIt just doesn't make any sense. Because you basically have people, not just Higuruma here, repeating their own mistakes again and again and not learning a single thing from them (see: Yuji). It becomes jarring when I'm being told as a reader that Higuruma is supposed to be intelligent and we see him plan for occasions when his technique doesn't work as he assumes, but then miss this spot completely when he was shown to have a similar experience with Yuji before? I would hope a Toudai lawyer would prepare more for his trials than Higuruma did here.  \n\nI just find it to be very poor planning on Gege's part. In addition, it brings up the issue of how Sukuna would know the limitations of Higuruma's technique, since he didn't seem worried about it at all. If he didn't know, then he was just operating on luck, which quite diminishes the claim of Sukuna's overwhelming intelligence. But there's also no evidence or thought process depicting how Sukuna knew about this. \n\nI hope what I'm rambling about makes sense.

            "If Sukunas CT got confiscated it would've ended the fight right there, he wouldnt have been able to punch all of them to death. \n\nA dissatisfactory ending of course, but he really should've just gotten Ten Shadows confiscated from him, it would've made perfect sense without being an asspull, wouldnt even restrict Megumi from using it since Judgeman targets specific souls, and it would avoid Sukuna breaking character. \n\nGiven what was at risk and his ability to absolutely fight back against domains or finding loopholes in other peoples techniques, it makes no sense for Sukuna to risk having his CT removed forever just to speed up the trial.",
            "You can literally erase Kamutoke, Higuruma and Kashimo from the sukuna fight and barely anything changes. There were like 3 months worth of filler/nothing chapters after Gojo died.",
            "Honestly, it would\u2019ve been an interesting way to see whether or not Higgy\u2019s CT would persist after death if Sukuna managed to kill him without Shrine and then immediately got it back. \n\nWait. Hold on. I had a thought mid-comment. But now I need to stir with it. I think I just realized why Gege elected for Higuruma\u2019s CT to prioritize Sukuna\u2019s cursed tool rather than Shrine. And it all circles back to Higuruma is alive cope (the agenda never dies)",
            "Yes but Higuruma's CT fading after his death at least makes modicum of sense. Why did the effects of confiscation persist, but the executioner sword didnt? Make it make sense ( hint: you cant ). \n\nThis crap only hapened because Gaygay wrote this bullshit tool into the story and didnt know what to do with it. Thats it.",

            "It would be like Kenjaku pre-gaming an encounter with Maki. There would just be no need to. \n\nLike imagine 2-3 pages of Sukuna's thinking deeply of how to counter Higuruma's technique only to show  him speed blitzing the fuck out of everyone in the next page. Imo that could make for a worse read and at least is a waste of pages.",
            "yeah i guess i was operating under the assumption that cursed tools ARE a manifestation of their imbued technique in some way",
            "But Higuruma was also worried it wouldve taken 10 shadows instead",
            "That\u2019s not right either. Since his domain is a part of his soul. Essentially it\u2019s just his hands, not a weapon. So taking away his cursed tool as opposed to his shrine. Is like taking a gun away instead of handcuff in him",
            "Nanami's death was also followed by a satisfying conclusion where Higuruma's was just another event in the midst of everything else.\n\nI really don't think Gege meant for anything to solely move the story forward, but a lot of things ultimately ended that way. Who Higuruma is or what his story was ultimately didn't matter, he could have been any kind of lawyer and fought for any other reason and things would have been the same. His own character never really drove his story, he was just in the wings waiting for Gege to give him purpose.\n\nSame thing with Kamutoke. Swap in any other explanation for how sukuna reincarnated and the story doesn't change. Make any other excuse for the confiscation missing MS and nothing changes. There wasn't any setup or expectation, save for us assuming about Higu's domain as much as he was.\n\nThat's why I mostly read just to see how my baby boy Yuji is doing. I hope his suffering ends soon.\n\nEdit: Same thing with Kashimo now that I'm thinking about it. Ultimately he existed to give a narrative reason Hakari chose to fight Uraume and to give Sukuna more screen time. There was no narrative purpose to the character of Kashimo Hajime at all; rename him Ser Gregory Gregor, a knight from England with the power of water and nothing really changes.",

There's no reason to assume that the vast majority of Cursed Tools are only at stockpile locations, right? \n\nKinda. I think we forget that a Cursed Tool is a cursed object, and cursed objects contain curses and attract curses. There appear to be two kinds of missions in Jujutsu Kaisen before Shibuya, which is to retrieve Cursed Objects, and to exorcise Cursed Spirits (the very first chapters and the detention centre respectively). \n\nIf we get a Cursed Tool that isn't sufficiently cursed to attract curses enough to attract Jujutsu society's attention, then it probably also isn't going to be that useful in a fight. \n\n> Wouldn't there be more free floater Cursed Tools around?\n\nFactions within Jujutsu society have it in their best interests to accumulate stockpiles: Jujutsu High, the 3 clans, the religious groups, etc. Combine all of these facts, and I think it paints a pretty good picture of why Cursed Tools are somewhat less common than maybe they could be.",

            "Why would it take Ten Shadows from him though? Wouldn't that need Fushiguro Megumi's original body since from what we know CT are engraved on physical bodies (according to Gojo at least)? But by the end of 237, Megumi's physical body is dead because Sukuna's Heian form incarnated fully. That's not Megumi's body anymore, so there's no Ten Shadows to take, it's gone permanently.\n\nIf we go by Gege's explanations of incarnations on Choso and Yorozu, once the sorcerer incarnates fully, the original person and their physical form is dead, correct?\n\nI get people's issue with this particular development however. I'm sorry, but people can write all the defenses for it they want, it doesn't change the fact it reads like an \"asspull\". CE and CT are both inherent possessions while a Cursed Tool is something completely external. There wasn't actually much clearly stated explanations for Higuruma's CT really, so I think it's very natural for most of the audience to assume that Judgeman would end up confiscating inherent qualities from the one being judged (This is actually one of my peeves with Gege, as he deliberately keeps things vague, so he can really write whatever development he wants to, and there's not many arguments/complaints you can make against it afterwards).",
            "... Guys contribution to a fight, even this one at the end of the series, isn't what defines a character or tool. Kashimo and Higurama BOTH had compelling characterization that was explored through the narratives.\n\nFailing doesn't mean there was no narrative purpose IMO. Sure, Kamutoke was deleted before it could be used against people who weren't immune but that single use gave a clear insight into how Sukuna could annihilate entire elite squads by himself. It's a point of characterization in how the apex of sorcery had no qualms about using a tool while modern jujutsu families looked down upon it with disdain.",
            "Executioner Sword is a far more potent ability and thus has an implicit drawback to it, like most techniques, in that it doesn't persist after death. For all the bitching about Gege \"telling not showing\" with Kamutoke, you people sure suck at understanding what he's showing you!",

Part of the whole staff was shoved in the ground, and that definitely included metal bits. This is why I strongly think it\u2019s related more to CE to be able to pull off the full lightning bolt effect - he could of course shock whatever he\u2019s touching in a given moment to make it electrical like he did the water, but I don\u2019t see that as the same as his use of the lightning bolts at range between himself and the object.",

The idea was to give the reader the same amount of information Higaruma himself actually had, not to trick the reader to make them feel stupid. I also wanna be clear that the process your describing is something pretty much every mangaka does, plenty of authors have talked about going back and reading further into something they initially did not plan. But the evidence to support that something like that happened here is entirely non-existent. There is nothing to suggest that Gege did not have this planned out the power thought out the whole time, not that he suddenly just made up a new power on the fly because he didn\u2019t know what to write there. Pretty much everything that has happened in the fight so far has been set up beforehand, whether it be Yuji developing Shrine and eating the other Blood wombs, Mahoragas constant adaptation allowing for continuous evolution in Shibuya, Megumis Soul being crushed vs , The possibility of switch training being shown by Itadori in Kusakabes body, etc. When you factor in that the creation of a manga is not just one persons will but the collective work of a team supporting an authors vision, it\u2019s likely that the entirety of this fight has been plotted out with at least one editor for over a year now.",

Showed me that the Gege cared enough to get it out the way to make an easier chance for his heroes. \n \nBecause as the fight went along and they made note of him losing output due the Gojo fight + Yuji\u2019s attack, that lack of a curse tool becomes ever so apparent to be an MVP moment for Higurama.",

            "Did you seriously just downvote me because I said Gege deliberately hiding things is my pet peeve? I didn't realise having pet peeves against creators while giving them hundreds of dollars is considered a crime now.\n\nIf he was truly trying to keep true to Higuruma's character, then Higuruma of all people, should've considered the possibility that Judgeman would confiscate extrinsic things as well as inherent qualities. Especially since we literally see him being surprised that his CT confiscated Yuji's CE, and admitting that he didn't know the limitations of his own abilities. So did that encounter just fly out of his mind very conveniently, so that he wouldn't make smart decisions on the most important battle here? When we see him being unsure of what crimes to charge Sukuna, since he's not sure which charges will actually stick?\n\nYou say that there's nothing to suggest Gege did not have this planned out ahead of time, but absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence here. You have no proof that he did plan it out properly either. In fact, plenty of mangakas also talk about having to think of things on the fly for reasons such as their manga ranking lowly and in danger of being cancelled. See Hori cutting short Kamino Arc, Tsukushi adding in Nanashi, etc. Planning out details a year in advance is extremely unlikely for any weekly mangaka just by the grueling schedule alone. Audience reaction, such as being enjoued, also is a large factor that any mangaka needs to consider. This is a commercial magazine, you thinking that audience reaction doesn't matter to creators is incredibly naive. \n\nI can buy Gege planning to have Higuruma's technique fail, but you really can't convince me that he planned much in advance this particular instance of having Judgeman confiscate an external tool such as Kamutoke here. If that were the case, then we should've seen Higuruma at least consider this as a possibility, the same way that we see Yuta consider the failure of him picking out Jacob's Ladder in his domain. That occasion is clearly to have been planned. But this one? Sorry, no.\n\nIn fact, Gege actually said in his own fanbook that he doesn't plan out the details ahead of time. He said that he has the general gist of the story and plot points in his mind, but what gets him from point a to b is usually left blank, and he likes to go with the \"what is the most interesting way things will play out?\" technique.",

            "Yes and no, I believe the confiscation *would* last forever, but theres always the option of appealing, which is actually fairer than it seems because eventually Judgeman will accuse you of something you havent done, or can at least argue your way out of.\n\nI dont know how high the range of an appeal is though, it might just break all rules and work from anywhere, since Higuruma didnt need to recast his domain.",
            "Definitely didn\u2019t downvote you bud. There are other people who may disagree with your opinion.\n\nI think it\u2019s been shown and emphasized since Higarumas entrance that he has a great gap of experience, that being his largest flaw. In the chapter before the incident in question, they spend about half of it going over various areas of knowledge Higaruma is unsure on, particularly about the degree to which actual legality plays into the outcome. The idea that he did not know the full depths of his technique were for sure set up. I would agree with a critique of the actual narrative consequence, as I would\u2019ve liked to gain greater understanding of Kamutoke, but I remember reading the chapter where they go over the plan thinking \u201cHm, I know there\u2019s something I\u2019m not considering here\u201d.\n\nYour absence of evidence point doesn\u2019t really make sense because your view, the one which was initially challenged, is the one that lacks evidence. You\u2019re making a claim, but the claim has no evidence to back it up. The idea that the author is \u201cdeliberately\u201d writing in the way you say has nothing to show that degree of deliberation.\n\nI also disagree that my points don\u2019t have evidence. The evidence is the plethora of other plot beats that have happened in close proximity to this one which have been set up well in advance. We can prove that because we can see that the chapters that set those plot points up were written years ago. Plot points being something that are set up happens with regularity. I don\u2019t disagree that Gege probably writes some shit simply because he thinks it\u2019d be interesting. But he clearly finds it interesting because he really likes the battle system he\u2019s created. That\u2019s why he spends so much time dropping information about it. The rules of the system itself are interwoven with the actual themes of the series. I have good faith that he\u2019s not breaking the rules because I can point to a lot of times he was extremely consistent with these rules. And he clearly has put a lot of stock in these rules as he hinges a lot of important narrative weight onto them. That\u2019s why he sets up many of the big technique lore drops in advance and reveals some as the characters discover it. Like he literally made the system. The narrative that he is always withholding information is not real, withholding information is just a real narrative storytelling tool that a ton of authors use. It\u2019s ONE way he delivers information. And it\u2019s not near the most frequently used one in this series.\n\nI haven\u2019t seen that quote from the fan book, but if you have an image you could share I\u2019d love to see it.\n\nI only push back on this so much because a lot of people say everything that\u2019s happened in this fight has been an asspull or bad writing, and it\u2019s just not true. And if we\u2019re all being real, this only really became a problem after Gojo v Sukuna. This community has been so overly critical, while offering critique that defies basic reading comprehension. Maybe it\u2019s a vocal minority, but it gets tiring. If this isn\u2019t you, feel free to ignore.",

I can understand a lot of people feeling burned out about it but it\u2019s one of the few series that takes the peoples opinion of \u201cIf *character x* did this then the fight would be over\u201d and proves that it wouldn't be the case the more chapters we read.\n\nOther than the super vague binding vow card being played for Sukuna\u2019s problems, this entire plan of taking Sukuna down has been really crazy to break down once you re-read through its steps.",

            "That's kind of hilarious because I'm not sure what exactly offended them. Was it me saying Megumi is dead, or that I have a pet peeve against Gege? LOL.\n\nI get the point about lack of experience. The problem with this particular development is that he already has experience with regards to how he didn't know the exact limitations of his own technique. He admitted to it, was surprised by it during the Yuji trial, so theoretically, he should've gained experience from this, right? But his experience with Yuji conveniently just didn't factor into his mind at all.\n\nIf say for example, Gege didn't show things this way, that Higuruma had already had a similar experience with Yuji of being surprised by his own CT, then I can buy him overestimating himself and assuming that Judgeman would confiscate only internal qualities. But once Gege actually demonstrated Higuruma's admission of him not understanding his technique well before the Shinjuku, then it becomes a lot less convincing why Higuruma, legal prodigy, appears to have learned nothing at all from his experience which was explicitly shown to the reader.\n\nI actually think my claim (that Gege deliberately keeps things vague, so he can more easily fill in plot points afterwards with the readers not able to complain against his logic for JJK world) has quite a bit of evidence to back it up. For instance, the Kenjaku vs Yuki fight, which was ended with the Anti-gravity technique that Itadori Kaori conveniently owned. We had no foreshadowing, no warning at all that Kaori ever had a technique like this beforehand. But conveniently enough it worked to cancel out Yuki's last stand (I'm not going to complain about the physics aspect here, I think that's been done to death already, it's not as a big deal to me tbh).\n\nThere's also the issue of how Yorozu wasn't able to have a full heal, but Sukuna was, which Gege put in as an author's comment later on after 237. This plot point regarding how incarnations work was also kept deliberately vague until the revelation of Sukuna's Heian body.\n\nThe other issue is Gojo's motivations. I've been doing a lot of thinking about this one, and I realised that Gege had actually intentionally kept Gojo's morality and motivations in the dark. Even though there's Hidden Inventory, there's actually precious little illustrating things from Gojo's POV. This one is long planned however, the more I think about it. But the point stands still that I think he kept this in the dark deliberately, so that the shock factor would be greater.\n\nThe quote actually comes from the afterword of JJK 0, my mistake.

But for my part, I had been having some issues with his storytelling for a while during the Culling Games, it's really 236 that gave me huge problems, which is why I started posting here. I'm guessing a lot of the complainers were the same way. For what it's worth, I do agree about how a fair amount of the complaints are just being nitpicky. But also, from what I remember, there were complaints for a long time during the Culling Games, they just pretty much all got downvoted and shouted down.",
            "I never said you weren't",
            "Arguement 1: \u201cThe manga shouldn\u2019t end at executioners blade, that would be stupid!\u201d \n\nArguement 2: \u201cwell of course it seems stupid because Gojo died in 236 and that wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. \n\nArgument 1A: \u201ckenjaku\u2019s death was horrible!\u201d \n\nArguement 2A: \u201cwell you only think that way because Yuki died to the black hole when she should\u2019ve gotten Kenny too, that would\u2019ve been a much better death\u201d \n\nStraw manning is, by definition, arguing against something that\u2019s not the main topic of the discussion",
            "You\u2019re mentioning that Higaruma should\u2019ve learned from the experience, but the issue is not that Higaruma does not learn from experiences. We see him learn and adapt on the fly after Judgeman does not work as intended. It\u2019s that his lack of experience creates gaps in his knowledge which cannot be bridged in a short amount of time no matter what because they are things that are gained with experience. Nothing from his experience with Yuji would give him cause to expect this. He\u2019s a prodigy because he\u2019s been able to advance this far in this amount of time with little knowledge of the strict ways in which the rules interact. And as the OP outlines, there are a myriad of reasons it would be extremely difficult to even lab this situation out, combined with the fact that this interaction is not the obvious outcome. This is not something most people would think to lab out, particularly when there are strict fundamentals he could be working on in that time frame. \n\nAs for Antigravity system, the fact that Kenjaku had a gravity based CT was already shown earlier in this same fight. He could have just as easily had said he was using RCT on the gravity technique, but neither outcome changes the fact that he already had a gravity based technique active the whole fight. The fact that said technique came from Itadoris mom is like an interesting piece of information but it\u2019s not as though the operable technique being used was pulled out at the last moment. He used an ability we already saw him using via RCT which we already know can be done to produce the inverse effect of what the technique was. Who gave him the technique is the only real new information revealed in that chapter, which doesn\u2019t actually impact the fact that he\u2019s been using the gravity technique the whole fight.\n\nNot really sure what you\u2019re referring to as far as the Yorozu fight. Also not really sure what you mean about keeping Gojos motivations in the dark. I\u2019ve been pretty clear on what his motivations are the whole series. \nI don\u2019t know if this thread is the best place to really get into it but I think Gojo is a superbly written tragic hero throughout the entirety of the series.\n\nI also just pulled out my copy of JJK 0 and you\u2019re taking that quote completely out of context. Gege is talking about how when he starts a series he doesn\u2019t have a particular theme in mind and how there are a ton of ideas from past projects that got cut that he fuses together. He talking in particular reference to the fact that he didn\u2019t force JJK to start, he wrote a One Shot and thought it was pretty interesting and so he decided to pursue the idea further. To use this as evidence that in the late game he\u2019s doing the same when he starts the sentence with \u201cWhen I start a Manga series\u201d seems improper, especially when all of this was written in 2020 since the volume of JJK 0 came out in January of 2021. That\u2019s at least two whole years before even the start of the fight between Gojo and Sukuna and I think literally before Higaruma had even been introduced into the series. His process for \u201ccoming up with a series\u201d before its even hit publication just doesn\u2019t make sense here.\n\nTo be Frank, most of the criticisms regarding Geges actual writing ability fall flat to me. I\u2019ve read a lot of manga of very varied qualities and this certainly is not bad writing. If you don\u2019t like the writing of the series thats you\u2019re prerogative, but I challenge you to consider what the author is trying to say to you as opposed to what you want them to be saying. Because Gege Akutami actually has some extremely interesting thoughts on society that I think are worth delving into.",

            "Non-sorcerers doing it would be pointless. Unless you can add on Cursed Energy or kill the curse a sorcerer can become, you\u2019re only making the situation worse.\n\nAs for conventional weapons for sorcerers? It depends on the character. Ancient sorcerers just don\u2019t know how they work and probably don\u2019t want to learn based on their mentalities. The Gojo squad more or less picks weapons they like for various reasons. And modern sorcerers\u2026 are (reasonably) scared to. There\u2019s always the factor of \u201cincreasing gun use will increase emotions associated with guns will increase curses\u201d. You stick with the tried and true methods cause any change could be disastrous.",

Neither did I.\n\nConventional weapons are cool and all and probably effective but they\u2019re like an agreement between HQ and the government on interventions as those weapons aren\u2019t infused with cursed energy meaning they\u2019d just make the problem worse.",

            "Gege did a horrible job explaining. But yes the leaders of the Japanese government, and the emperor are apart of the jujutsu shenanigans and helped keeping it covered up. The guy who angel and the others save in 209 or 210 (I can't remember) gives a vagueish explanation on why they aren't getting involved and why they haven't in the past. And also kenjaku having a seat at the table is another big reason. He essentially assured that no one would interrupt what is going on. \n\nAlso, despite kenjaku saying this, he later contradicts himself by saying the military never stood a chance against sorcerers and cursed spirits. Proven by the fact that grenades and snipers werent even enough to damage the helicopter head sorcerer (I'm assuming he was around grade 2)\n\nI'd love to give a less paraphrased and more detailed answer to your questions but then I'd have to re-read. \n\nAs for what Japanese military, or defense forces have been doing since shibuya, they've probably been working tirelessly for the population in making evacuation shelters and defending the citezens. Think about the scale of what just happened and how long it would take to make things right. They'd need longer than a month. Most nations in real life could barely deal with covid. They're probably leaving the jujutsu stuff to jujutsu sorcerers",

            "Because JuJutsu sorcerers must only be killed with cursed energy attacks or cursed weapons. If not then they will come back as vengeful spirits.\n\nIt was whole reason Kenjaku fooled the US to send their army into the culling games so that it would result in more cursed spirits being spawned.",
            "On the point of having sorcerers with guns, in universe, a lot of them are still minors, so gun laws probably still apply to them (even though they're technically like soldiers). Even if that wasn't the case or we didn't apply that logic, out of universe, it'd be kinda boring if everyone just had a gun, especially if it made things too easy in certain cases, plus it doesn't really fit the aesthetic of jujutsu sorcerers. Their society I'd also ruled by conservative oldheads who may see conventional weapons like that as beng beneath them, like with what Naoya said about those who rely on Cursed tools, so it probably wouldn't be encouraged.\n\nOn the point of using this weaponry on Sukuna, there's two reasons why that isn't a great idea:\n\n1.) Sorcerers and Cursed Spirits can't truly be neutralized without Cursed energy. In the case of sorcerers, they turn into vengeful Cursed spirits, and in Naoya's case, it only seemed to make him stronger, so you could imagine how terrifying that would be in Sukuna's case.\n\n2.) Snipers would have to be situated within Shinjuku in order to keep Sukuna in range (according to the two second research i did confirm the farthest recorded shot of a sniper and the size of Shinjuku) which would obviously put them in danger of getting in his line of fire. He could easily send off an insta-kill slash in their direction the moment they start firing.\n\nAlso, given how Maki was able to dodge a point blank range shot even before her awakening as well as Kenjaku being able to react to a sniper shot as in the panel you've shown, I've no doubt that Sukuna may very well be able to react to the shot before it ever hits him.",
            "Naoya came back like several times more powerful because he was killed without CE. It's a pretty bad Idea especially vs Sukuna the range on his slashes and the lack of CE from regular humans means he'd kill them in one shot. He could literally slice the buildings the snipers are hiding in and they get squashed by the debris.",

But how many soldiers do you think are capable of killing Sukuna? I'd say a fat zero. \n\nDoesn't help that Mai isn't remotely as useful as she'd be IF she was in Maki's shoes. \"It's wise to use conventional weapons when attacking a sorcerer\" but even Toji didn't bother using his Gun to shoot Geto when he easily could've dispatched him right there before shooting the Star Plasma Vessel. \n\nI think Kenjaku was mocking Mai.\n\nI mean... He caught the bullet while saying it... It doesn't get much more patronizing than that.",
            "I don\u2019t think the government involves itself in Jujutsu related incidents. That\u2019s more the job of the Jujutsu Society. Same goes for a lot of anime, governments never actually involve their selves into supernatural events, they always leave it to the sorcerers (JJK), devil hunters (CSM), hunters (Solo Leveling), heroes (OPM).",
            "The military intervention in the culling game makes it clear that while firearms are effective against sorcerers, there is a level where their efficacy drops off.

            "I think part of it is explained with Hakari being shunned from Jujutsu High based on the modernity of his cursed technique. Modern = bad, and they have enough influence to make sure the military doesn't intervene. \n\n If I was a higher up there's no way I wouldn't start a \"cursed tool\" ammunition factory so squads of non-sorcerers could get rid of small curses (maybe Grade 2 and below) and free up working sorcerers. But it also sounds like higher society is also slightly dismissive of non-sorcerers in a less extreme version of Geto. \n\nThe government actually is responsible for the budget of the high schools; comes from prefectural taxes. They got into it in the fanbook and light novel (Yuji has to follow Ijichi around and see him apply for traffic and encroachment permits to exorcise stuff that would need to be closed off)",
            "The Japanese government does not have a military after World War II.  Part of the constitution they made was to be a pacifist nation gave up their rights to a military Just the Japanese defense force, JDF.   I\u2019m not sure what rules apply to the defense force versus a normal military but every time I see them, they always have to get 186 levels of permission. They don\u2019t seem very  well equipped to handle anything other than post kaiju relief aid, standing by waiting for things to happen, and internal Japanese struggles.  \n         I do wonder though about the whole guns thing. Sure regular bullets would not be a good way to kill a sorcerer, but a couple shots to the leg will really slow you down.  Also can\u2019t any competent sorcerer imbue things with cursed energy at least temporarily. So if they have bullets with cursed energy, shouldn\u2019t firearms be effective??",

However, fighting a sorcerer straight on with a normal weapon would be useless as even haba (helicopter dude who was probably grade 2) was bulletproof. Mai in that scene used a surprise attack with a sniper (which failed miserably), but it was still a surprise attack\n\nThousands of soldiers getting decimated in the colonies was the answer for why the military doesn't really get involved.
