To address the acne, as you have sensitive skin I recommend a product with Azealic acid.\n\nBut if you want to change your routine, introduce the new products in slowly and wait at least 7-10 days before using another new product.

There\u2019s a few combinations, so it\u2019s hard to know which ones you are specifically wanting to know. Some basics are glycolic acid shouldn\u2019t be used with retinol or benzoyl peroxide, etc Generally you shouldn\u2019t use more than one acid, as it can be irritating (some products have it already together, but that\u2019s different as they\u2019ve created a safe combination, but it still can be too irritating for some people). \n\nIn terms of AM and PM, yes you can use products that shouldn\u2019t be used together at different AM and PM routine times, but be mindful it may still cause irritation from over stripping your face. For example if you use AHA during the day, using retinol at night might be too irritating, so it might be better to just use hydrating products instead. Everyone\u2019s skin is different, so some people it could be fine but others it might not be.",

            "That looks like a reaction of some sort, especially considering the itching. Given the placement, it could be from haircare products as well as skincare, laundry, etc. Your best bet is to have it checked by a doc for proper diagnosis and treatment."

Paraben preservatives are the stuff that keeps microorganisms like bacteria and fungi from growing. Unfortunately the more natural the preservation, the shorter the shelf life.

Parents Said its maybe because you are growing and once you are grown it will be gone. This year in January I went to a dermatologist she prescribed me some things. I used those and my acne went away. but The issue is She Recommended me Expensive stuff and I can't afford that again. So I need advice how to keep good skin and what are it's basics? also make it affordable too. ",

            "Can you list the name of the products the dermatologist gave you?",
            "1. You need to cleanse your skin: effectively but gently. Oily skin overproduces skin oil, that oil clogs pore and hair follicles, which then becomes a ground place for bacteria and then, hello, blackheads and pimples. \n\nDo not use soap for face cleansing. It\u2019s too harsh for our face skin. Use a special face cleanser: a cleansing gel, a cleansing foam. It doesn\u2019t have to be expensive. Just look for a gentle cleanser for oily skin. There is an Indian brand - Himalayan Herbals. They are sold in supermarkets and are not expensive. They have a cleansing gel with neem extract. Neem is very effective for acne, it helped clear my face. So if you can, try this gel. \n\nWash your face with a cleanser at least once a day, in the evening. And in the morning - simply wash your face with water. If you notice that it isn\u2019t enough and you are too oily, then wash your face with a cleanser twice a day. \n\nIf you cannot afford commercial face cleanser: \n\nin the evening cleanse your skin 1) first with an oil. Castor oil or sunflower oil is best. Put some on a cotton pad and gently rub into your skin. Wash your face with warm water. Then cleanse your skin with kefir or homemade yogurt. Both contain probiotics and dissolve oil and sebum. Or you try using only kefir /yogurt, without the oil, but I am not sure how well they can remove the sunscreen. Or you can try washing your face with soap after oil cleansing and then using yogurt/kefir as a toner after soap. \n\n2. Always use a clean towel for your face. Use many small towels for a face. After one use, throw it in the laundry and the next time take a new clean one. That\u2019s why it\u2019s better to buy several those small cheap towels or wash cloths. Or you can use a new tissue (napkin) or paper towel every time, depending on what\u2019s cheaper. \n\n3. Wear a sunscreen in the morning, that\u2019s not too heavy. If you are oily, you probably don\u2019t need a moisturiser in the morning. After washing your face, put on a sunscreen and that\u2019s it. \n\n4. In the evening, after washing your face, use some moisturiser. It should be light, not heavy. From time to time, you can just put fresh aloe Vera gel on your face instead of moisturiser. India is humid, so aloe Vera should work great. It\u2019s best to use a commercial moisturiser or cream bc it has better chemical balance. But I guess if you can\u2019t afford it, you could just go with aloe Vera gel for a time. A moisturiser doesn\u2019t need to be expensive. A basic moisturiser is enough for most people. There is only this much that actives in the moisturiser or cream can do, so a basic moisturiser is okay in many cases. \n\n5. If you have pimples or acne: \n\nneem powder is a traditional aurvedic ingredient. It should be cheap in India. Mix it with cosmetic clay powder and warm water and make DIY cleansing masks 2-3 times a week. \nUse fresh green tea extract 2-3 times a week (spray it on your face). \nLook for sulfur ointments in the pharmacy, they should be cheap. \nAlso ask for salicylic acid and zinc ointments in the pharmacy. They are also usually cheap. \nMake homemade calendula or camomile extracts to rub the face. These plants have antibacterial ingredients. \nSalicylic acid also can be naturally found in some plants. If they are available in India, you can also make homemade extracts for face. \nSalicylic acid helps with oiliness and acne, so check out the skincare products in the supermarket. \nBenzoyl peroxide is another ingredient that helps with acne. In US, there are a lot of over the counter benzoyl peroxide ointments sold in the supermarket or pharmacy and they are cheap. Maybe there are some in India, too. Look for active ingredient called benzoyl peroxide. \n\n6. You can make a homemade vitamin C serum, if you have time. Here\u2019s the link: \n[easy vitamin C serum](https://youtu.be/0JXu3_WHM08?si=uL4IQMZoV_KwxQDy) \nIf you make it, use it in the morning, after washing your face and before sunscreen. \n\n7. You need to exfoliate your skin 1-3 times a week - gently remove the dead cells on the top layer of your skin. There are special peeling solutions sold in stores but if you cannot afford a commercial peeling product, use clay masks 2 times a week for exfoliating and cleaning pores. You can also add charcoal powder into it. \n\nYou can also exfoliate and cleanse your skin with milk in the morning 2-3 times a week. Milk contains natural lactic acid.",

            "Cleanser, gel moisturizer, and sunscreen are easily replaceable and you can get for an affordable price. \n\nThe capsules and clindamycin adapalene you have to get from your doctor again since those are usually prescription.",
            "Second this. Keep the clindamycin adapalene gel and there are some good drugstore options for the other products. Check out the recommendations in the wiki for this sub. The adapalene will also help with scarring. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend doing anything extra about scarring besides moisturizer and sunscreen until your acne is pretty under control and you\u2019ve stuck with routine for a few months.",
            "dr. was also suggesting me a scar removal type cream to help remove the acne marks. but it was way too expensive so I didn't buy it. what can i use for that? any suggestions?",
            "will the scars go away? without any specific cream/meds for it?",
            "There\u2019s silicone scar gels but personally I like adapalene for fading acne marks which is already in your prescription",
            "One person who you may find helpful on YouTube is Dr Dray. She is a derm with a lot of videos on skincare and recommendations for inexpensive drug store products.",
            "The adapalene increases cell turnover which is great for scarring! Scars do take a while even with creams or meds. \n\nThe most important thing you can do is to prevent additional scarring by preventing acne and keeping acne lesions from scarring. I recommend hydrocolloid bandages to help with active acne lesions. I buy the Cosrx ones off Amazon but there are certainly other options.",
            "yeah the wagamicin gel is too good. but the rest is way too expensive to make a routine from that.",

I used the products because my skin was so sensitive and dry so it was pretty much a must.\n\nHowever, about 3-4 weeks ago out of laziness, some mornings I would completely skip washing my face and sunscreen and just using a very gentle cleanser when I got home from work with no moisturizer after. \n\nI noticed my skin was improving with this routine and now my \u201droutine\u201d is washing with Cetaphil gentle cleanser twice a week and the rest of the week I only wash with water and my skin is looking great. \n\nShould I keep this routine up or will I regret it?
