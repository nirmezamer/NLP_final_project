If you're planning to go to an island as well, from September going, and would like to go with me, please let me know and I will tell you more about myself. But this is a little bit about me now-I'm a 27 year old Black woman in Houston, who loves to travel, especially to islands with beautiful beaches.",

From there, after doing some research I've narrowed it down to two options. Must stay a night in San Jose at the end to catch a morning flight home.\n\nItinerary 1:\n\nSan Jose Airport to La Fortuna\n\nLa Fortuna (3 nights)\n\nMonteverde (2 nights)\n\nManuel Antonio (3 nights)\n\nSan Jose (1 night)\n\nItinerary 2:\n\nSan Jose Airport to La Fortuna\n\nLa Fortuna (2 nights)\n\nMonteverde (2 nights)\n\nSanta Teresa (2 nights)\n\nManuel Antonio (2 nights)\n\nSan Jose (1 night)\n\nRight now I am leaning toward option 1 since that would be fewer long bus rides. However, I want to make the most of the limited time I have, and it seems most people on reddit highly recommend Santa Teresa for backpackers. At the same time it seems the options are more limited in Manuel Antonio. Any advice or recommendations would be appreciated.",

I'm trying to use my first solo trip as a way of really spending time having fun with myself. National or international both work. Here's some info:\n\nInterests: food, outdoor activities, adventurous stuff (think things that someone trying to be more carefree and daring might do, like caving or zip lining, but also things like nightclubbing, etc.).\n\nPoint of trip: try new things, get out of my comfort zone, let loose...but not too loose.\n\nIdeal weather: warm but not going above 90F\n\nMoney: under $3k.\n\nLength of trip: a week or less.\n\nAny and all suggestions are appreciated.

I have seen a good part of the northern states already, so my focus would be places to stop from Northern Florida to Maryland.\n\nWhere would you recommend I stop for overnights? What would you recommend I do while there? How about places to stop, stretch my legs, and see some interesting stuff?

My thing is, I was thinking about obtaining night vision goggles, preferably those that attach to your head and you can walk with them on if need be, **that do not have default mode in zoom!!!!** That is I want Night Vision *GOGGLES* and NOT Night vision *Binoculars*. I've noticed almost every single pair on amazon in particular of attachable headgear, are *binoculars* with 4x zoom or greater as nearest zoom mode. IE, impractical for general use/travel.\n\nI know this isn't the best place to ask but figured I'd try! This is mostly as a backup but there are some nearby trails open to public I can access and walk on I'd like to try at night time prior to next years (hopefully) trail hike. I'd just like to test as much gear as possible before I'm in the field. Thanks!",

I have no travelling experience at all, but I'm slowly getting the urge to see the world (London, Spain, Italy - later maybe Egypt). Many girls on TikTok motivate me, especially with the message that the world is incredibly beautiful and has so much to offer and that you shouldn't wait for others, but simply go your own way and set off. My problem is that I'll be travelling alone - and I'm totally scared of that! Especially when you keep seeing stories and posts online in which women my age are approached by a group of men, sometimes even followed. My question to all female solo travellers: How do you do it? How did you start travelling alone? What do you pay particular attention to? Would a cruise be a good idea for your first trip?

There is something important that I need to keep checking that week and it only requires internet access so just a phone is enough, and I realized there's nothing stopping me from being abroad then rather than waiting till the end of the week to start the trip. Spending this week in a SEA city that helps ease into the region rather than wait at home doing nothing but check my phone would be perfect.

            "Miami is an interesting place\u2014 I live somewhat close to it so I\u2019ve visited numerous times and have had mixed experiences.\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019re a woman who\u2019s solo-traveling there (or maybe a man, but I can only speak for women), expect to be hassled by club promoters on the beach. On one group trip, a promoter legitimately called my friend fat because we very politely declined his offer for tickets.\u00a0\n\nThings can get REALLY expensive, REALLY fast. Take Club LIV for example. Super famous club, if you listen to rap you\u2019ve heard of it. But it can be nearly $100 just to walk into the place, and then very basic drinks (e.g., vodka soda) start at $25+. When I went, I was drinking beer all night just to keep it around $15 per drink. Plus, the music was trash, rendering it not even that fun!!!\u00a0\n\nOn the expensive point, most restaurants and bars in Miami Beach tack on an automatic 20% service charge regardless of party size. Which is especially frustrating being that Miami is home of some of the slowest, rudest service around.\u00a0\n\nDO NOT DRIVE THERE. I REPEAT, DO NOT DRIVE THERE. Anecdotally, I have been involved in several terrifying road incidents there (e.g., presumably-drunk drivers barreling toward you through 5 lanes of traffic at 120 mph), and statistically, I work in insurance and see an insane volume of fraudulent auto claims come out of Miami. Do not drive there.\u00a0\n\nLike I said, I\u2019m geographically almost a local so I\u2019ve had time to have tons of negative experiences. But on a more positive note! The beaches are just beautiful and I love the hot weather. Miami is a melting pot of many different Caribbean cultures which is a beautiful thing. The Cuban food and coffee is top tier. Drink a mojito! Go dancing! It\u2019s a lot of fun and I wouldn\u2019t keep going back if there wasn\u2019t something to love about Miami.\u00a0\n\nI would say to just be prepared to spend a little money, Uber/walk/take public transit, and just be wary of scams like you would in any other tourist hotspot. You\u2019ll be perfectly fine."

I know India is great but can be very overwhelming and as a solo female traveler unfortunately I do not feel ready for it. I am currently considering Bali or Kho Pangan. However, I am wondering if they have become too touristy and you would not recommend them for a truly spiritual and authentic experience. \n\nIf so does anyone have any ideas of where would be better?

I know and I admit, that is the craziest financial decision of my life. And my vacation was approved.\n\nBut that's not the point, I only have Sydney Opera House, Darling Harbour, Opera Bridge, Australia Zoo, Bondi Beach, and the Gold Coast. I haven't thought about New Zealand and Brisbane yet. Where should I go? Here's my plan:\n\nI'm arriving in Australia in November 3 from Houston since it's cheaper, concert in Sydney is on November 7, then I'm flying to Auckland on the 10th, then Auckland concert is on the 13th, and flying to Brisbane on the 15th, then back to Sydney on the 19th and flying back home. Enough time to scope the concert grounds out. So I have free 6 days in Sydney area, 4 in Auckland area, and 4 in Brisbane area. I have $5,000 saved up for leisure, since I bought the tickets and I'm not sure if that's enough, but I will save up $3,000 more until November, just in case of an emergency and just extra leisure cash.\n\nPlease leave any recommendations or any good advice on where to visit, eat, and experience, or just anything good in general. It's also my first time flying long haul alone. \n\nThank you and have a good one,\nJames D.",

            "Hi I live in Sydney. You definitely won't run out of things to do. Sydney is a huge city that also has nature on its doorstep. \n\nNot sure what kind of things you like though? \n\nSome ideas for Sydney:\n- day trip to blue mountains (nice views, Australian bush and nature, hiking). The \"grand canyon\" walk is a good one. \n- Sydney beaches. Australia has awesome beaches galore and that even includes Sydney. Bondi beach is the most famous and it's a cool place to people watch and get amongst the crowd. From there I also highly recommend doing the \"Bondi to Coogee\" walk if you don't mind walking. You will see nice clifftops, beaches as well as get a vibe for the Sydney beach life. \n- day trip to royal national park. The beaches mentioned above are more like \"city beaches\" (beautiful and enjoyable in their own way but not as wild/untouched). If you want more of the wild nature scenery go to the royal national park for a hike over magical headlands and cliffs and stop at a beach for a swim. I think the area between garie beach and burning palms beach is the most beautiful. \n- Newtown: a cool place to experience some of the alternative scene in Sydney. Good food, great bars, cool little shops, live music\n- to eat: Sydney brings a lot of cultures' foods together. Be prepared for immense multiculturalism and great food, especially from Italy and Asian countries. Try Rivareno gelato, Australian cafe culture (coffee and brunch), Chinatown, Surry hills\n- do a walk from darling square to Darling Harbour to Barangaroo to Circular Quay. Follow the harbour waters edge the whole way around (as much as you can). You can enjoy the city and water views, there are many bars, restaurants ,nice architecture and people of all walks of life enjoying themselves. \n- chill at opera bar for a drink and a prime viewing spot of the opera house.\n\nSydney is immense. I've lived here for 5 years and there is always something new to explore. \n\nHere are some other places I will just mention without going into detail: botanic gardens, Barangaroo, Surry hills, Kings Cross, Darlinghurst",
            "Only four days in New Zealand? And four days in our dreary boring-as main city. Ouch.\n\nAs one commenter said, look at going South to Waitomo caves, Rotorua and see what you can along the way. You'll need to hire a car. Public transport sucks here.  I would not even bother thinking about going to the South Island. Simply not enough time.\n\nI'm not based in top of the North Island so I'll let other people suggest activities. The main problem you've got is time. New Zealand is mostly about the outdoor geography-specific experiences - snow and mountains and Fjords in the South, beaches and swimming, hiking, scenery. A wide variety of geography in a relatively small area - but getting around is difficult. There is very little good or cheap or fast inter-city transport.\n\nTry posting in /r/newzealand/ for itinerary ideas",
            "If you go to the north island go to Waitomo Caves. Do the full experience. I had a fucking blast. I could have spent the whole day in those caves man.",
            "I live in Auckland, and even though it isn\u2019t the typical tourist destination in NZ there definitely are options for a good time. You could make a trip over on the ferry to Waiheke for a day trip, in November it will be lovely! Take a bus wine tour if you like wine, or zoom around on a scooter. Take hikes through the waitakeres if you like nture, head out to piha if you have transport to see a wild black sand beach.\n\nYou could also head over to tiritiri matangi island and see some endangered native birds and nature.\n\nOtherwise it is possible to drive over to Rotorua if you time it right, it\u2019s quite a unique town for tourists to visit.\n\nAnd as someone mentioned, waitomo caves if you can.\n\nRenting a car would be easiest (although it will be the opposite side of the road)",
            "There's not a lot to do in Auckland. As far as cities go it's super boring and spread out. In Auckland there are nice beaches and the War Memorial Museum is good (not all war stuff, promise), however I'd head out to one of the islands. Tiritiri Matangi Island is fantastic and well worth the price if you enjoy nature and want to learn about our native birds or Rangitoto for a good walk and view of Central Auckland.\n\nLike others have said I'd head south of Auckland. I took my Canadian friend around earlier this year and she loved it, was so happy we spent minimal time in Auckland. I did Hobbiton for the first time and while I'm not a LOTR fan, it was outstanding! Waitomo Caves are always solid. We did the glow worm and Rua Kuri caves. Rua Kuri was my favourite as it was a much, much smaller group and you had longer in the caves. Te Puia in Rotorua has an excellent tour, you can spend as much time in the park as you'd like and you get to see kiwi. I'm from that area and also lived for years in Auckland so feel free to send me questions you might have!",
            "Sydney you could take the ferry from Opera house area (circular quay) to Manly beach or Watsons Bay, both are beautiful and memorable. Only ferries I've ever been on in my life so I thought it was pretty cool.\n\nLike another person said, Bondi to Coogee is pretty incredible. No point in hanging around at Bondi though, the beaches south are better and less touristy. (I lived in Bondi for a few months)\n\nAustralia has a lot of high end fast food and that's always the type of place I liked to eat. Go to an actual sit down restaurant and you will cry at the bill, but the fancy fast food is good and not as pricey.\n\nAlso I saw Coldplay in Melbourne and it was an amazing show, I think you will love it!",
            "I\u2019ve lived in Auckland. A great day trip is to take the [Fuller\u2019s ferry](https://www.fullers.co.nz/destinations-and-experiences/destinations/rangitoto-island/) from downtown to Rangitoto island, and do the couple-hour walk to the top. The view is great and the island is a relatively new (600yo?) dormant volcano so the landscape is surreal.\n\nIf you have a couple of days spare, take a flight to [Queenstown](https://www.queenstownnz.co.nz/).",
            "I did an electric bike tour in Sydney and loved it! I try to do bike tours in any new international city I'm in because you can cover a lot of the highlights in a short time and get your bearings, then decide later which areas you want to go back to. I was glad to have an electric bike (was my first time on one). We got to ride to areas that wouldn't be as accessible for most infrequent riders on a conventional bike. \n\nI also did the Sidney Harbor Bridge Climb, which I highly recommend! It's expensive, but it truly is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. \n\nIn Brisbane, Lone Pine Koala sanctuary. I really enjoyed Brisbane. It has a completely different feel than Sydney. Also, took a ride on the Wheel at night.",
            "What are your interests? It\u2019s hard to provide recommendations without knowing this.\n\nCan you cancel the Brisbane leg of the trip? Taronga Zoo in Sydney is probably the best zoo in Australia and Brisbane is pretty uninteresting. Auckland Zoo is also excellent.\n\nI\u2019d suggest seeing a show at the Sydney Opera House.

            "I hope one of your rental cars is for Brisbane because honestly you'll need a car there.\n\nIf you're going up to Australia Zoo then have a think about driving up to Maleny or Montville as well.  I can recommend the walk around Mary Cairncross Reserve.  It's pretty well guaranteed to see wallabies there.  The drive from Montville to Mapleton has some lovely views. \n\nThere are also some day tours to Moreton Island for a fun day out on a sand island.  I also agree with the other person that Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary is worth the trip.\n\nGo for a walk around Brisbane city along the river at Southbank, ride the Wheel, check out the Botanic Gardens.  Walk up to Howard Smith Wharves along the river.  I really enjoy walking around the city it has a nice feel to it.\n\nBack up on the Sunshine Coast, I can recommend Noosa National Park as a most excellent coastal walk but I recommend going as early as possible because parking is a real issue up there.",

            "I used to live in Sydney and I go back multiple times a year\u2014I live in Dallas now.  Too bad you\u2019re flying United from Houston.  DFW to Sydney on Qantas is a great flight marred only by replacing the A380 with the Dreamliner.  Everyone has made good comments about what to do in Sydney.  Walk around Circular Quay to people watch.  See the Opera House and walk around the Royal Botanical Garden.  I also recommend walking through the Rocks and working your way up to the Harbour Bridge and crossing it.  Beautiful views along the bridge and from Kiribilli on the north side.  George St Mall is nice and so is the QVB (Queen Victoria Building) and I would definitely take the train to the Blue Mountains to Katoomba to see the Three Sisters and the waterfall.  Bondi Beach is nice, but the walk to Coogee is stunning.  Definitely take the ferry to Watson\u2019s Bay or Manly Beach.  Darling Harbour is nice but Circular Quay is always my go to spot to have a coffee and people watch.  If you want night life, go to Kings Cross and Darlinghurst.  \nIn Auckland I highly recommend taking the ferry to Rangitoto and hike up to the top.  Beautiful views in every direction.  The Auckland Sky Tower is worth a visit too.  If you can rent a car in Auckland, make the drive over to Piha.  It\u2019s worth it.\nIn Brisbane the botanical garden is nice and there is some nice shopping in the CBD as well.  I\u2019ve heard mixed reviews about the Australia zoo.  Taronga Zoo in Sydney is nice and so is Featherdale Wildlife Park.",

I would say you can also get great food at lower end restaurants / sit down places though. E.g. cafes, lots of sit down Asian restaurants are similarly priced to \"high end\" fast food. You can get things like quality stir fries, dumplings, curries, ramen for very decent prices. Also, authentic Italian pizza is great in Sydney (just choose an authentic one, e.g. Rosso Antico in Enmore/newtown) and while not super cheap it's still filling and good value if all you get is a pizza.",
