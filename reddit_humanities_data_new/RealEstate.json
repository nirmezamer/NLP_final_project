            "I\u2019m sorry for the news. They care about you and for many people, a house is the largest and most valuable asset they have. \n\n1. They paid $30k for it, but when the house transfers to you, you gain a tremendous benefit: the \u201cbasis\u201d of the house will reset to current market price. If you were to sell immediately, there would be no taxable gain since you\u2019d gain $0. Since the house never re-appraised, the residential property taxes will also remain set at theoretical last appraisal done on the house. Likely the property taxes owed on the house are substantially less than what would be owed if you bought the house new. \n\n2. If you rent the house out, you can sell the house in a \u201c1031 Exchange\u201d and transfer the built-up equity and basis into another house (or multiple properties) of \u201clike kind and value\u201d to keep renting out. Simply put, the money you\u2019d make from the sale of their house could be applied toward 1 or more rental houses elsewhere (even in Idaho or other states) so you could have a nice income stream. Note: 1031 exchanges are only for rental properties, not for a place you live in. You cannot commingle the gains in 1031 into a house you live in without paying capital gains / taxes. \n\nVERY importantly \u2014 you need to find out if the instrument that transfers the property WILL NOT be subject to probate. Probate is a court process to determine the deceased assets and liabilities and square them up before executing the last will and testament instructions. The proceeds of probate are TAXED in most places and it can eat a lot of your inheritance up. \n\nSkipping this mess can usually be accomplished by having a TOD (\u201cTransfer On Death\u201d) document witnessed and signed by all parties, usually recorded with the County Recorder\u2019s Office. This lets you skip probate (and costly probate taxes). Check with the County Recorder\u2019s Office where the house is located to inquire about a TOD. \n\nYou can do the same with bank accounts; you can make them POD (\u201cPayable Upon Death\u201d) and do something similar with stocks / bonds / CDs. Brokerage accounts, if they have any, usually have a beneficiary process. Each brokerage will have different forms and a slightly different method to confirm the account owner\u2019s wishes. \n\nAll of this is a tremendous gift. I doubt your grandparents want the tax man to take half because of some simple paperwork. Talk to them about it if it turns out there\u2019s no TOD and see if they are amenable to singing one and getting that in place else the tax burden could be quite substantial. \n\nOf course, consult with qualified professionals to make sure you\u2019re doing all this by the book and the right way. \n \nGood luck and I\u2019m sorry to hear your grandparents are in the years of their twilight. How wonderful that they think so highly of you.",

            "Pray that this property is in a TRUST.  Why? \n\nBeing the beneficiary of a +million-dollar real estate property held in a trust can offer several tax benefits. Here are the key advantages:\n\n 1. **Avoidance of Probate**\n- **Benefit:** Assets held in a trust typically bypass probate.\n\n- **Tax Impact:** Probate avoidance can save on probate fees and potentially reduce estate taxes, as the property is not subject to probate court oversight.\n\n### 2. **Potential Estate Tax Reduction**\n- **Benefit:** Trusts can be structured to minimize estate taxes.\n- **Tax Impact:** For example, irrevocable trusts can remove the property from the grantor's estate, potentially reducing estate tax liability if the total estate exceeds the federal estate tax exemption.\n\n### 3. **Gift Tax Advantages**\n- **Benefit:** Transferring property into certain types of trusts can be considered a completed gift for tax purposes.\n- **Tax Impact:** This can help in reducing the size of the taxable estate and may allow for leveraging the lifetime gift tax exemption.\n\n### 4. **Generation-Skipping Transfer (GST) Tax Planning**\n- **Benefit:** Trusts can be designed to pass assets to grandchildren or later generations.\n- **Tax Impact:** This can help in avoiding or reducing the generation-skipping transfer tax, which is applied to transfers to beneficiaries who are more than one generation removed from the grantor.\n\n### 5. **Income Tax Benefits**\n- **Benefit:** Depending on the type of trust, the income generated from the property can be taxed at the beneficiary's tax rate, which might be lower than the grantor's.\n- **Tax Impact:** This is especially beneficial if the trust distributes income to beneficiaries who are in a lower tax bracket.\n\n### 6. **Property Tax Benefits**\n- **Benefit:** In some jurisdictions, property transferred to a trust might be eligible for property tax exemptions or reductions, especially if the trust is structured to benefit a spouse or other close relatives.\n- **Tax Impact:** This can lead to lower property taxes over time.\n\n### 7. **Step-Up in Basis**\n- **Benefit:** For revocable trusts that become irrevocable upon the grantor\u2019s death, the property typically receives a step-up in basis.\n- **Tax Impact:** This can reduce or eliminate capital gains taxes if the property is sold shortly after the grantor\u2019s death.\n\n### 8. **Creditor Protection**\n- **Benefit:** Trusts, particularly irrevocable trusts, can protect assets from creditors.\n- **Tax Impact:** While not a direct tax benefit, protecting the property from creditors can prevent loss, ensuring the property remains in the family and continues to offer its tax advantages.\n\n### 9. **Charitable Deductions**\n- **Benefit:** Trusts can be used to make charitable donations.\n- **Tax Impact:** Contributions to charitable trusts or from a trust to a qualified charity can provide income tax deductions for the trust or reduce the taxable estate.\n\n### 10. **Special Use Valuation for Agricultural Property**\n- **Benefit:** For agricultural or family business property held in a trust, special use valuation may be available.\n- **Tax Impact:** This can reduce estate taxes by valuing the property based its current use and not the highest or best use.\n\n### Important Considerations\n- **Trust Type:** The specific tax benefits can vary depending on whether the trust is revocable or irrevocable.\n- **State Laws:** State laws can significantly impact the tax benefits associated with trusts, especially concerning estate, gift, and property taxes.\n- **Consultation with a Professional:** Given the complexity of tax laws, consulting with a tax professional or an estate planning attorney is crucial to maximize the benefits and ensure compliance with all regulations.",

After countless showings and 40+ days on the market we finally got an offer; recent reduction helped. \n\nIt was a low-ball offer but not so far away that we couldn\u2019t counter.  I countered\u2026. They countered.  Ultimately, I was around $5k away from my minimum amount I wanted to clear. \n\nI told my realtor, the sales price is acceptable if the buyers agent can take 2% (in other words, I would pay 5% commission).  My realtor responded with a thumbs up emoji at 7:15 PM and I didn\u2019t hear from him again until the next day at 9:15 AM. He texts me, \u201cI can\u2019t believe this agent can\u2019t get her clients up 6k. BS imo\u201d\n\nI\u2019m a little confused as I told him the sales price is agreed upon and it\u2019s up to the realtors to take a reduction of 1% in commissions.  \n\nI start heeding questions from my realtor about another buyer who visited the property the previous day\u2026. Almost as if he\u2019s avoiding the subject. Finally at 6:00 PM today, I ask about the buyer with an offer\u2026. His reply \u201cit died, they wouldn\u2019t budge.\u201d \n\nMe: \u201csales price was finalized, did the commission reduction kill it?\u201d\n\nRealtor: \u201cyep. No worries, we are moving on.\u201d\n\nMy wife and I are at dinner thinking WTF is going on and perplexed how our realtor and personal friend could be so nonchalant about the only offer we have seen in 1.5 months.\n\nAfter dinner, realtor and I exchange more text and it leads to me demanding a phone call immediately. I end up scolding him and corner him into him telling me that he never relayed the acceptance of the sales price offer with a 1% commission reduction to the other agent.  I called him a greedy fucker that lied to me because he couldn\u2019t fathom a $2500 reduction on commission also knowing I\u2019m about to use him to purchase a $850k+ house.\n\nI made him revive the deal and am now waiting to see if this will finalize.

Frankly, not even relaying the counter can result in suspension or termination of their real estate license in most states. \n\nI tend to agree that you are risking a deal on principle at this point and if there is too much pushback on your request to lower commission, it is prob still worth eating the $2,500 if you don\u2019t have other offers in hand. I would be cautious though about the buyers trying to re-trade after an inspection and further reduce purchase price. \n\nHowever, there are several ways to fix this, including using (or threatening to use) a different realtor for the purchase of your next house. Either way this \u201cfriend\u201d prioritized 0.5% of their own commission (assuming they would split the cut with buyers agent) over your guys relationship, which tells you everything you need to know about your friend going forward. \n\nSeparate the transaction and the relationship fuck up.

You're essentially asking your agent in a roundabout way to take a pay cut to get you your net figure.\n\nYou calling your agent greedy because he wants the fee you already agreed to in writing is the pot calling the kettle black. Again, you're essentially asking him to take a pay cut so you don't have to. Idk if he didn't explain this to you clearly and if he didn't, shame on him, but you killed the deal with that buyer, not your agent. \n\nLastly, calling people idiots on reddit for trying to explain this to you makes me think this probably was explained to you by your agent.",

He'd present it to the agent, who would more likely refuse it and not even entertain it. There was no offer to the buyer, because you didn't make an offer to the buyer.\u00a0\n\n\nThat's assuming presenting the offer was even legal, as others have pointed out it might not have been. Best way to present your offer is to then ask the buyer to cover 1% commission (which reduces their overall commission fyi), but buyer's agent refused that too - because that's effectively what you asked the buyer to do.",

That was the time to negotiate a lower commission, not once there was a deal on the table.  The honest thing to do would have been to either walk away from the deal or accept it.

They likely showed them the property. They submitted an offer and have been involved in counteroffers going back and forth.\n\n\u00a0Now, you are essentially saying \"I know I offered X% if you would do that, but I've decided I will only allow you to earn Y%\",  after they have put in the work. Realtors assume the risk of a deal falling through, but they don't assume the risk of you going back on the offer you made them.\n\n  \nIf someone made an offer to you \"I will pay you $X to do this task\", you performed the task and then said \"I have changed my mind, I am going to pay you $Y.\", how would you feel?\n\n  \nI agree that, in general, real estate commissions are too high. But that isn't the issue here. The main issue is you can't change the deal *at this time*. \n\nThe thing your agent did wrong is not telling you this.",

BS imo\" - because buyers agent refused to reduce commission, sellers agent isn't about to reduce his commission, and that means the only party who can make up the 1% difference is the buyer, because you won't pay it and the agents aren't willing to take a pay cut from the contract each party agreed to, and you don't want to pay it either.\n\n\nSo there's no deal with your counter.\n\n\nSecondly: Let's say your counter had been 0% commission to buyers and sellers agent.\n\n\nDo you honestly think your agent is at all obligated to take that offer and receive no compensation? Obviously they are contractually entitled to compensation, so someone's gotta pay it - either they *voluntarily* take a pay cut, buyer pays it, or seller pays it.\n\n\nWhy do you think reducing commission by 1% is acceptable without the impacted party's input?

Then again I don\u2019t know you and judging how you have received some pushback in this thread he didn\u2019t think you\u2019d take it well and as a result tried to brush it off. He should have been blunt with you I cannot ask a colleague to take less money because it will make me look unprofessional and greatly impact people wanting to do business with me in the future.

You\u2019re also counting his pockets saying he should take a haircut because he\u2019ll make it back in the next sale in ten he\u2019s doing the same to you, thinning this guy is about to buy a house that\u2019s 50% more in value and is worried about a measly 5k.

However, he decided to take a huge chunk out of my front yard, about 2-3 feet,  to extend his already huge driveway. \n\nIs it common for a builder in 2023 to give you 2-3 feet of land that isn\u2019t technically yours? I don\u2019t want to confront my neighbor just yet. I want to ensure I have concrete proof and facts in hand. I found a surveyor who is gonna charge me $900, so I am getting this taken care of just looking for advice from others who have dealt with this. \n\n",

If they deny the issue or make a weak proposal that doesn\u2019t make you whole, then to me, the convo would go like this: \u201cI understand. Neither of us want to be in this situation, but whether you meant to or not, this is a taking of my land. I have a legitimate property interest and I am within my rights to involve the permitting office, and they will demand a demolition of the driveway and return my property to its original condition. It\u2019s as plain as that.\u201d\n\nConsider if there could be a win-win alternative other than returning the land to its original condition *if* there is something more valuable that you could extract. For example, if your neighbor wanted to pay a much-more-than-fair price for the land (perhaps because that would be cheaper than the alternative of demoing and redoing all that driveway), and that would be a better outcome for you, by all means present it. Personally, I would not accept any sum of money less than the #sq ft taken divided by the total #sq ft of the lot X the Zillow estimate, plus $20/sq ft taken. This would be likely be a great return for you. It\u2019s a lot for the neighbor to pay, because you are charging a weighted averaged rate for sq ft that averages improved and unimproved land, but only \u201cselling\u201d unimproved land. And then that $20/sq ft premium probably ends up being less than what they\u2019d charge to tear it out and redo it (in a way that looks aesthetically consistent with the work already done). If they try to negotiate on price, just remind them, \u201cHey, it\u2019s my land that\u2019s been taken here. I don\u2019t feel very good about it. I\u2019m coming to you in good faith as a neighbor to see if you would like to return it to its original condition, or if you\u2019d like to pay the value that I place on this land because I want to preserve the relationship. I have the right to offer to sell my land, and you have the right to decline. If you have another idea I haven\u2019t considered, I\u2019m all ears. Long after this is resolved, we\u2019ll still be neighbors and hopefully friends and I want to make sure that neither us feels cheated. But right now, I do feel cheated, and I don\u2019t want you to walk away from this feeling the same way that I feel right now so I thought I\u2019d give you options.

            "How has been vacant since October, figure they winterized it by turning stuff off.",
            "since there's a cutoff (or should be at least lol) just before both of those there's no reason couldn't have one on and other off ...",
            "If they won't let you test the water, you need to budget for it being replaced.",
            "They have concession money and plans to replace the HVAC, so I don\u2019t think the HVAC is their concern. It\u2019s the rest of the stuff that the gas is needed for.",
            "This could be anything from a leaky $20 valve, to needing to replace all the gas lines. You should be able to get the system pressure tested for leaks without having to turn it on.\u00a0",
            "Single family home stand alone home of average size that is only 30 years old (that\u2019s modern) that 30k is probably 5-10x the actual anticipated costs of a really nice new hot water heater, plumbing and gas lines.  It\u2019s a negotiation point.",
            "What would you hope to gain? If the seller is being uncooperative then you walk and get earnest money back and then you're whole again.",
            "\"either you give us an extension AND turn on utilities at YOUR cost so they can be properly tested, as you indicated they would be when we last agreed ... OR agree to the following concessions /variations that include the full cost of replacement for ANYTHING we can't test/ verify.\"\n\n\"if the seller is dealing with us in good faith then surely none of this will be an issue...\"",
            "Yep same thing. Seems like the price needs to go down more to cover the cost of gas line replacements",
            "Have you tried calling the city and asking them what\u2019s going on?",
            "Ahh okay I purchased a few months ago and the seller hid a slab leak they painted over expansion material between the slab and stem to hide the evidence. Thankfully the location of the leak and the fact I have a solid friend that was a plumber made it less of an issue and he rerouted the pipe through the attic for me",
            "Fuck em. Pony up $300 or they pay to replace whole water heater",
            "You're being lied to. No one is jeopardizing sale over a $300 part. It goes way beyond.",
            "Plumber should be able to pressure test that, did they say why they couldnt?",
            "Seems like a reasonable response as to why they can\u2019t turn on the gas. They likely didn\u2019t know the city had locked due to code violations. \n\nBeing that the water heater is only 4 years old, it\u2019s likely in working condition\u2026however this property seems to have other issues involved. \n\nIf the city was involved in this, was the property condemned? \n\nI hope you understand the significant costs around bringing a property back to code. You\u2019ll need to hire professional contractors, pull permits and have the city inspector out after each item is brought back to code. \n\nSellers get out of these properties so they don\u2019t need to invest more into it. They\u2019ve made their money off the rental.",
            "I have done it lol",
            "Lol what",
            "Most likely yes. You may even be able to look it up online. If it's a small agency, walk in the front door and talk to them. They often love to talk to people that need their help. They may not tell you everything, though, so remain vigilant.",
            "Four years is not overly concerning typically they\u2019re worth at least 10",
            "Realtor as well. I agree with you! $2k less on the offer would be less than $10 per month difference on the mortgage. \n\nOthers have said the sentiment I share. Get an extension and let them know if they don\u2019t have the gas and water on by X date you will be terminating the contract, and if I were your realtor I would advise you to follow through with termination. Like u/rasperries-are-evil said, if there are defects it could cost you a lot of money.",
            "Agreed. But they appear to be unwilling to. The point of my comment was that I would be willing to pay the relatively minor cost vs the price of the house if the alternatives were to lose the deal or to go ahead with the purchase without being able to conduct the tests.",
            "Yes, but sometimes fire department or gas utility will cut off/lock gas meter if a plumber/HVAC tech red tag a piece of equipment because they know regular people can turn on the little valves at each piece of equipment. It depends on the regulations in the locality.",
            "You seemed to have missed the part where it\u2019s not just the hot water heater it\u2019s the entire HCVC system.",
            "Any rough idea how much it costs to replace/repair gas lines? I will also google it haha",
            "Would the city release information on a house we don\u2019t own?",
            "We had a plumber come do a hydrostatic test and it passed",
            "Frist time home buyer so do not know the expense to bring things up to code.\n\nElectrical needs to be brought up to code and the HVAC needs to be replaced, Has some rotted siding that also needs to be replaced.\n\nWe knew about the HVAC and budgeted for that. Got some quotes for siding that we can handle, but concerned if maybe we are under estimating the cost to repair/replace all of these things.\n\nIts an older home so not expecting it to be perfect, but want it to be safe",
            "Absolutely unreasonable. Hundreds of thousands if dollars being held up by $300? UNACCEPTABLE!",
            "Agree there, I guess my concern is about the gas lines, hot water pipes.\n\nWhy not tell us about the $300 before the first inspection or before the plumber came by?   \n  \nI dk if im being too negative but feels like they hid it from us.",
            "Fair point. I think sellers willing to lose a sale over $300 is insane. They are playing a bluffing game and their own realtor needs to snap them out of it.\u00a0",
            "The HVAC, as is clearly stated, was already an issue they knew about and was being handled by them Seperately.",
            "Whatever price you see, quadruple it.\n\neg if Google says 2-5k, you include concessions for 20k (4x upper limit) in case there are \"unforeseen works required\".\n\nSo either they cave and you can check it properly and go from there, or noone agrees to anything and you can walk away.",
            "The entire run? $2-5k",
            "Worth a shot!  Explain to the them your in the process of purchasing a house, what you were told, and that you wanted to reach out to get a handle on what that means for you moving forward so you know what to anticipate!",
            "That\u2019s for sewer but that\u2019s good. Some houses have there water lines under the slab it\u2019s the stupidest shit but it\u2019s common in anything from the mid 2000 and prior",
            "I would walk",
            "Electric will be tens of thousands",
            "Electrical is extremely expensive! This can get upwards of $70k+ very quickly. If it\u2019s out of code, this is a serious issue. \n\nYou need to get experts inside to inspect and give bids. \n\nHonestly, if you\u2019re a first time home buyer and do not have hands in knowledge and/or $100k to bring this up to code, I would be talking to your realtor on possible outs of your contract. \n\nLook, I totally get that this place was probably within your budget and this is why you chose it, but this home is going to need much more work than you anticipated. \n\nYou won\u2019t be able to live in the home until things are brought up to code. You won\u2019t be able to have utilities turned on until it\u2019s inspected by the city. \n\nI\u2019ve worked with plenty of first time home buyers who were looking for a good deal and Wi  the in budget. Sometimes you need to be very patient. Look for homes that need more cosmetic work, this requires a great imagination! But stay clear of properties that need electrical or plumbing unless you have a background in this type of work. \n\nSo, look for homes built 1950-2000, that are outdated, has paneling walls, old cupboards. Needs wallpaper removed, new floors etc. stay clear of major repairs like this one. \n\nAs far as getting out of your contract now\u2026\n\nHow much ED did you put down?\n\nDo you have any contingencies?  (Inspection, mortgage, etc) \n\nIt is very likely, a lender will not approve this property as is\u2026so a mortgage contingency can be your out.",
            "Walk my guy. This is a lot of work for a house you won\u2019t be able to live in until it\u2019s up to code. I know it seems like it\u2019s in your budget for the price but it\u2019s not worth it. You won\u2019t be able to close anyways without certificate of occupancy anyways.",
            "30 year old home is a very new home.  Old homes are 100+ years old and have interesting basements/crawl spaces around here (and no AC - that was introduced much more recently than 100 years ago)",
            "Duuuuude what are you doing!?",
            "It isn\u2019t just $300, it needs repair and re-inspection\u2026.its out of code.",
            "They did because they are actually hiding something else from you.",
            "I mean, you can run water through the pipes without the water heater being on gas line part could be a little concerning not major once they turn it on check the couplers with a little soapy water and make sure nothings leaking, but I would be willing to bet your house payment that you won\u2019t find I\u2019m not actually gonna do that though",
            "We are in option period so can walk away",
            "In addition, I highly recommend finding a realtor that will be advising you on the right property and can be on the spot when one comes available (meaning, getting you in the door within hours of listing)!",
            "Learning how to buy a home.\n\nWe are new to this.",
            "Yup. $300 is nothing.\n\nIf I was selling, I'd pay $300 myself just to get the deal done. \n\nThe only reason they're not is: *They don't want all of the other problems revealed if the gas is turned on.*",
            "Walk away. I rolled that dice once. It took ten years to financially recover.",
            "Okay, that\u2019s good. I would definitely do more research and yes, even walk away. Might not be worth hiring the contractors to come out for inspections and bids."

        "content": "Just a fun little story from when we sold our house. \n\nWe had a realtor no show for a showing, which was quite annoying since we had to vacate the house with a toddler, dog, and cat. Apparently the agent thought the house was vacant and she could just go whenever?? So five hours later she asks if she can come, we don\u2019t need to leave as the buyers aren\u2019t with her. Sure, whatever. Apparently the buyers had seen the house from the outside (???) and she was doing a video tour to show them the inside. I\u2019m in FL and they\u2019re in Cape Cod. \n\nWe did have a couple show up and knock on our door so I asked the agent if it was them\u2026. She didn\u2019t even know!! I was shocked. But anyways, she does the video. She loved our little house. Great. I was stunned at how unprofessional she was. Reeked of cigarette smoke and just her entire presentation, but I guess she wasn\u2019t meeting with her clients that might be why. \n\nBuyers put in an offer at list price. We\u2019re thrilled. Inspection happens, a few things come up, nothing major but definitely things here and there. Inspection period passes without a word from their realtor, they didn\u2019t ask for anything. Again, we were thrilled! \n\nThe day before our closing, their agent reaches out to our broker asking if we ever got anything on the inspection report fixed\u2026.. broker responds uh no, you didn\u2019t ask for anything to be fixed. Like what??? \n\nThen, closing day comes. We were buying a new house as well and using the same law firm for the closing. Met the buyers in the lobby, lovely people. The agent asks me, right in front of them, if the spa area of the pool and pool heater works (it said right on the listing that the pool is not heated, didn\u2019t work the entire time we lived there) so I said no I don\u2019t think it does, it didn\u2019t work the whole time we lived there. But then I tried to deflect and say that we don\u2019t like heating the pool anyways because if you need it heated then the air is too cold to enjoy swimming. Idk, I was just mortified she was asking this in front of her clients and scared they would walk.\n\nWhen I told my agent and broker that story, they couldn\u2019t believe it. It was just such a sharp contrast compared to my team, who are so professional, knowledgeable, and the best in the town. \n\nIn the end everything went through great. Worked out well for us that their agent dropped the ball since we didn\u2019t have to make any concessions or repairs, but I do hope they\u2019re happy in the house, it will be a winter home for them.

            "We bought from a neighbor and they had a pretty slimy, idiot agent. \nIn all honesty, if we had known the details of their house before they listed, we would have tried to do an off market sale but we didn\u2019t. We were the nosy neighbors at the Open House and ended up loving it.\nSo we made an offer above asking and included a letter because we were friendly with them. We call our close friend/agent who has represented us in other deals, she sends the offer literally hours after the Open House, and we don\u2019t hear anything for DAYS. By this point, I had talked myself out of it and hoped the new neighbors would be nice. Then, my agent calls. Their agent wants a rent back and an appraisal clause. I\u2019m like we can discuss a rent back but no won\u2019t do an appraisal clause. No response. Again, thinking house is gone. Surprise surprise she comes back that we got it! \nNeighbor comes over for something unrelated, but I\u2019m like hey while you\u2019re here, here\u2019s your earnest money, start chatting about inspections/timeline/etc. He shows us the house they\u2019re buying, all cordial. (Again we got along well so if they hadn\u2019t already listed with her we would have had zero issues doing an off market deal). I said I was surprised how long it took to hear back and assumed they just didn\u2019t want to hurt our feelings. He\u2019s like oh no let me tell you- we accepted day 1 but she was emailing the contracts to the wrong email address! I\u2019m like oh so what about the rent back and appraisal clause? He\u2019s like what? So apparently they had verbally accepted our offer but she was (1) trying to sweeten the deal for them (or her commission?) and (2) sending the info to the wrong email so nobody had any idea what was going on. \nThroughout the process, my agent had to explain multiple different very normal things to this woman, who is a prominent agent in our area!! Then, she didn\u2019t even show up for the closing. Now when I see her signs places I just roll my eyes.",
