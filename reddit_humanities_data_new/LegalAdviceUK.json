            "The Ramblers Association suggests there's no issue unless it's a banned breed or a guard dog.\u00a0\n\n\nhttps://www.ramblers.org.uk/go-walking-hub/rules-around-keeping-animals-fields-paths\n\n\nHowever, I would consider that there are a couple of risks\u00a0\n\n\n- your dog jumps, pushes someone over and they're injured. They make a personal injury claim against you. I would suggest ensuring you have pet insurance that covers third party liability - or, at a minimum, Dogs Trust membership which includes third party liability cover (but not health cover) at \u00a325 per year.\u00a0\n\n\n- someone brings their reactive dog along the footpath on lead, your dog is over friendly and gets bitten, and there's a hefty vets bill.\u00a0\n\n\nYou may wish to post a sign at the entrance to your property - something tongue in cheek - \"Please note this public footpath passes through our private garden. Golden retriever welcoming committee on duty, the committee welcomes butt scratches, new dog friends and cuddles. Their mum asks that you don't feed them, even if they beg\".\u00a0\n\n\nThis will give reactive dog owners and dog haters fair warning, and everyone else a bit of a smile.\u00a0",
            "A similar example would be a public footpath running through a working farm, surely? Sheepdogs are always out on patrol and no one would dream of telling the farmer to keep them on a lead. So as long as you're willing to accept some risk to your dog from a reactive dog (which may or may not be on a lead anyway) then I'd say you're clear.\u00a0\n\n\nA notice that includes the breed would be helpful to walkers who may be nervous around dogs. A Goldie is a very different proposition to some breeds.\u00a0",
            "Interested to see what the legal answer is here. \n\nAs an aside, it would be worth you putting a sign on the path entries saying \u201coff lead dog in this garden\u201d or some such. \n\nAt least then people are warned and have the chance to make their own choice about entering. I know a lot of dogs who would react badly to a \u2018friendly\u2019 dog approaching when they are on lead. If nothing else, it could result in your dog sustaining an injury, which it\u2019s better to prevent if you can. \n\nThen there\u2019s a lot of people who are terrified by dogs, and again a \u2018friendly\u2019 large dog greeting them might backfire if they feel like they have to protect themselves.\n\nGiving people advance warning seems fair, just as farmers do with cows in a field.",
            "Yes, you can have the dog off the lead *but* as with it being off the lead anywhere else, you're responsible for ensuring that it's not out of control or causing any sort of danger to others.",
            "Unless your dog could be described as dangerously out of control or is physically causing harm to someone or their property, then no, there is nothing against having your dog off lead in your own garden.",
            "Can you fence the footpath off?",
            "Legally there is never a requirement for dogs to be on the lead in the UK unless they are a banned breed or in on private land that requires it.\n\nPractically, this is a risk to your dog, if someone passes through with an aggressive or reactive dog and yours bounds up to say hello then he could be injured.  If a human who hates dogs passes through they might decide to kick him away or throw something at him.  Its rare, but it can happen.  Also your garden doesn't sound secure if there is public access to it so your dog could wander off into danger or be led away/tempted away by someone's picnic passing through/stolen more easily.\n\nYou might want to look at fencing in the right of way so that your dog can be off lead in your garden without any risk to him.",
            "You can apply to divert/alter/etc the right of way:\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/public-rights-of-way-landowner-responsibilities#creating-closing-upgrading-downgrading-or-re-routing-public-rights-of-way \n\nYou could then make a sign saying, \"This is the way\".\nGood luck.",
            "Yes you can let your dog off her lead.  Standard laws on dangerous and out of control dogs apply.  However, not everyone on the footpath might appreciate a dog running up to them even if you know its friendly. \n\nIf its not too long a path, you could fence, hedge, garden feature it in - ensuring the minimum widths are maintained - 1.5m for footpaths, 3m for bridleways. Thus allowing your pupper unencumbered free rein of the section separated off from the path.\n\nIf you have the time, and energy as it takes a lot going through all the legal processes, would it be possible to route the footpath around the edge and then fence it, keeping as much space for your pupper as possible? You would need to apply for permission (highways agency, local council, LDNPA, etc) to change the route, and have reasons for moving it (more than \"spoils the view\", \"disrupts the ambience of the garden\") and shouldn't greatly increase the distance.",

As long as it's not a threat and not encroaching spaces where there is farm stock and not under control. Being from the area you will know this \n..\n Keep gates closed.\n\nIf your dog is friendly then the person who accused you can accurately be described as an arsehole and I wouldn't hesitate to say as much, but at the same time take the dog away from them as they obviously have a fear.",
            "NAL. Clarkson Farm got a bull and they had to put up 'Warning Bull'.  Put up signs 'Warning Dog'.  Do the ramblers have climb a gate/fence into your garden?  If the rambler sees the sign and decides to enter your land it might change any issues ie they decide to move ahead after being warned.\n\nAs I say NAL.",

With a locked gate on each fence, so you can cross the footpath to get to the other part of your garden.  Plenty of things you could do with the far sector of the garden, you could turn it\n\n You knew you were buying a property with a footpath through the garden.  You could apply to the local authority to move the footpath to the far perimeter of your garden and fence it off, but you may  have to give up more land to the route as the new route would have to meet the old footpath. Into a kitchen garden, an orchard, put an office, art studio, workshop or a summerhouse  out there.",
            "You are not allowed to put an animal on land crossed by a public footpath with the deliberate intent of discouraging users of the footpath.\n\nDoesn\u2019t sound like that is the case so you would be fine to have your dog off the lead. \n\nThe other question would be about letting dogs off leads on a footpath which remains at the owners discretion, though recommended that users of the footpath only do so where the dog is under control. Technically your dog crossing onto the footpath without your supervision would break \u201cbest practice\u201d but no law is broken.",

            "Legally, you're fine but I do think it's rather inconsiderate. I've had reactive dogs in the past. An unleashed dog approaching can undo years of training in reactivity, and in cases of elderly or infirm dogs can also cause injury or significant pain. \n\nI'd also like to add that a lot of people are scared of dogs, don't want to be approached by dogs or even just feel intimidated even if your dog is friendly. \n\nI completely understand your position but yea, it really really sucked when I struggled so hard to be able to walk my reactive elderly dog or had our days ruined by such incidents. In her last year She had hip pain and absolutely just loved to go slow walks and just wanted to be left alone by other dogs. Instead she would become absolutely terrified because she was in pain, going blind and deaf and felt under attack.",
            "I have a reactive dog. He doesn't go for dogs but he's utterly afraid of dogs charging at him, friendly or not. \n\nA sign for walkers saying you have a dog would give people like myself time to prepare - put a muzzle on, loosen the lead etc.",
            "As someone with a reactive dog, I\u2019d be really grateful for the warning so it gives me time to grab some treats and be prepared to focus my dog away from yours. \nIdeally, if you\u2019re in the garden too, it might be helpful for you to be able to call back your dog in case there\u2019s drama, but we\u2019re used to dogs approaching.",
            "I would second this, but do not put a beware of the dog sign as this accepts liability if anything does go wrong. Just something like \u2018friendly golden retriever here\u2019",

If someone gets worried (even if they\u2019re stupid and it\u2019s just an excited dog) it would be against the law. \n\nI completely agree, get a fence put up or something, if nothing else, to protect your doggo. \n\n\n [https://www.gov.uk/control-dog-public](https://www.gov.uk/control-dog-public)",

            "Oh yea same. But to be honest I think the most polite thing would be to recall a friendly dog and ask if they can approach the people/person or dog first. I've had friends terrified of dogs too, it's not rational but yea. I agree if I saw that sign I'd turn around if I had my reactive dog but I'd think it would be nice for everyone in the situation to be happy and able to get along in their day/on a walk. \n\nPersonally I never leave a dog out of my line of sight and wouldn't let a dog off lead unless they had bulletproof recall or in an enclosed empty space and I wouldn't let them approach a person or animal without consent. I just think it's a considerate approach to take.",
            "That's okay to have a difference of opinion from mine. I'm not saying it's wrong, or unfair. I just think it's inconsiderate and I should be allowed to express my opinion on the matter. I've lived with a public footpath in my garden and I took my own approach to only have my dog leashed in the garden and off lead when enclosed or in an empty area. \n\nI agree people are free to do as they wish. I just know that I personally don't want to inconvenience anyone. And for me, again personally, the positive of having my dog off leash near a public right of way wouldn't outweigh the inconvenience it could pose to others. \n\nAs I said, if I saw that sign I would turn around because I'd rather not expose my dog to triggers so I feel we are actually in agreement on that front that it's unreasonable to expect others to cater to the triggers of others and not vice verse. But I also think it's considerate to do what we can, to the best of our own capabilities to accommodate others in life. A sign would be a good way to do that. Recalling a dog that approaches people is another. Restricting a dog without recall not to approach is another. It's all about finding a balance on works best for the person and it's also about how much of an empathetic or sympathetic (can never remember which is which) they are as a person.",
            "Sadly in this uncommon circumstances yes, I do feel it is. I think any situation of allowing an off leash dog to approach strangers (human or animal) is inconsiderate. It's just a shitty situation where they don't have an enclosed private space but I do think a considerate measure would be to put up a sign warning people of the off leash dog and allow them to make their own decisions rather than being caught off guard. But again, I want to make it clear that this is based on my own person standards and I understand and respect that others differ in this, and I believe it should be okay to discuss such things openly and honestly. I strive for the do no harm mentality, and I don't think it would cause any distress to prevent the dog approaching people but it could cause distress in allowing it to.",

It's common for people without children to park in the child/parent bays, it's common for people not to return their trolley, it's common for people to throw their used vapes on the ground. It doesn't mean it's not inconsiderate to others. \n\nI say this as a huge animal lover and someone who was a veterinary nurse. Unsupervised animals can end up in fights, getting injured or causing distress or issues. Not everyone loves dogs. If you want to leave your animal unsupervised around the public, you do you. But if your dog approaches others and it's unwanted, that's also on you. And some people/dogs/animals don't react favourably to that. \n\nI also just want to say, I respect where you're coming from, but I do simply disagree and feel my position is valid.

Especially if it's not enclosed.\n\n\nWhich conflicts with your latest statement\u00a0\n\n\n>If someone of the general public needs to scale a fence to gain access, then that would be considered a private enclosed space. Which I've said I have no issue with?\n\n\nIf your dog cannot be trusted not to attack, then I would suggest that a private hire field is more appropriate than a public footpath.\u00a0",
            "Yea, that paragraph means I believe your dog should be under your supervision at all times. As in you should be with your dog. In public or in private spaces. Kinda like a child, I wouldn't leave a toddler alone in a garden and I wouldn't leave my dog alone unsupervised either. I'm aware others don't share this opinion and that's okay, that's life, we all differ in how we approach things.\n\nAnd yea, in her 16 years of my dogs life I never had one fight break out because I was considerate of others and took steps to mitigate her reactivity and also intensive training. I quite frequently took her to private hire fields but I also took her on proper walks, keeping distance from other dogs, maintaining her attention and asking others to recall their off leash dogs. I kept her muzzled and she never posed a danger. She was my responsibility and I had a duty to myself, her and everyone else. She would ignore any dog that ignored her. She was fear reactive and just wanted to be left alone by other dogs after she was brutally attacked when younger. \n\nBut you seem fixated on this just being about reactive dogs. It's not. It's about considering other people as well. There are a lot of people terrified of dogs. I want to reaffirm that OP is well within their right to enjoy their garden with their dog. And I realise my opinion is unpopular but that doesn't mean it's invalid. That's why I'm staying it would be considerate to put up a sign, and the most considerate thing to do would be to prevent the dog approaching strangers in the first place as you don't know the person, their history or how they'll react to the situation."

            "I'd suggest he goes to HR, assuming it's one of the big supermarket brands then the buck doesn't stop with store management. Almost certainly they haven't handled this per company policy.",
            "Wow. Imagine their outrage and likely action if the sexes were reversed.\n\n\nThey should be taking action.",
            "You will have internal whistleblowing process for this.  \nIn the first instance contacting HR about both the assault and local management\u2019s failure to deal with it but there will be other channels given as well.",
            "Read the grievance procedure ( this should be openly available, either in your contract or within the workplace) with regards to \"prohibited acts\" these are things like sexual harassment violence etc \n\nIf it happens again after complaining then raise, a formal grievance as the informal one has not worked. \n\nThere is usually a standard procedure for this and at a minimum should follow the ACAS code of conduct.  I\n\nAnd speak to ACAS or citizens advice for free advice on the matter although they operate on a complete non bias way and can help with explaining how things should work.",
            "I feel like contacting the police would be a good option here. Imagine if the roles were reversed and he had done that to the female colleague.",
            "There\u2019s loads of good advice here but I would add, with him being so young it must be quite scary for him especially as he\u2019s being dismissed by HR/management. Please support him through or if you feel you can\u2019t, find someone who can so he doesn\u2019t feel alone. I feel like you may find they continue to not take it seriously until he escalates it and to keep pushing through the escalation will be a lot for a teenager.",
            "It\u2019s sexual assault. Contact the police in the hopes it will make the company take it seriously.\n\nIf it was a 50-something man doing it to a young woman they would rightly think he is a threat to the safety of young people working there. Which this woman also may well be.",
            "Before he does anything else he needs to read through his employment terms and conditions/handbook/whatever to see what exactly the policy regarding harassment/inappropriate behaviour is. \n\nIf the policy states that there is no tolerance whatsoever then he can raise a formal grievance against the offender and also against the manager who shot it down.",
            "Supermarkets will often be unwilling to take action in these cases unless you make an official complaint. Did your co-worker put their complaint in writing? Or did they just talk to the management?",
            "Management are dead wrong on this. The fact that someone \u2018didn\u2019t mean anything by it\u2019 is not a defence to sexual assault and it\u2019s not the responsibility of victims to create a sexual assault free work environment.\n\nYour colleague could try escalating this to a more senior level of management or HR, as they may not want the legal risk of casual sexual assault being normalised. Might be worth speaking to a union rep about this.\n\nYour colleague could report this to the police, although as a practical matter he may want to think about whether that will achieve his desired outcome of creating a better workplace environment.\n\nUnfortunately the reality that many people minimise sexual assault by women against men is going to be a hurdle to getting people to treat this seriously. Legalities aside, being an active ally to your colleague and calling out unacceptable behaviour when you see it will probably help him if he\u2019s being gaslit by management.",

            "Uk based HR graduate here. While I don't practice HR at the moment I feel like I can still give some advice.  Go to HR. If the manager isn't going to do anything about it then that's a massive breach of sexual harassment/assault laws and HR will want to take action. Demand it be dealt with. Try and arrange a meeting with the manager with HR present as a witness at least and outline everything that's happened, ask again if the manager is not going to do anything about it and see what they say because HR will take it seriously. If not, then go to the police and begin the process of taking legal action.",

He walked by her later on and slapped her back on the outside of her hip with the back of his hand as he was passing her by going in the opposite direction\u2026didn\u2019t  even hit her on her butt. She called police he was arrested. Lost his job, he had to go to court and now we are being civilly sued as well. Doesn\u2019t matter she did it first to him. Doesn\u2019t matter that we have several witnesses. It\u2019s been a nightmare.",
            "I don't know about other supermarkets but  tesco have something called protector line where incidents like this can be reported. I think this should be looked into and reported via that channel. \n\nIf he feels uncomfortable about it then he shouldn't just take it as banter and roles reversed with genders then doubt it would be so lenient.",

            "Wow, imagine if he had done that to her. There would be an outrage. This is why it is *so important* that men speak up too and be taken seriously. \n\nDoes your company have a union? If so he needs to join it asap and speak with them, i'd also suggest looking through your companies sexual harassment policy, as this is exactly what it is, then speak directly to HR, pretty sure all uk companies have an internal whistleblowing route. The manager is wrong for not escalating this. So they too will now be in trouble. ACAS are also really good, so might be worth contacting them to see what they can suggest. As he's young, he might need some extra support and guidance from you.",
            "This sounds like a problem HR should be aware of or your Union rep, you should be able to carry out your job without any fear or harassment, and that goes for any gender.",

            "Any union that can be involved? What she did was very illegal.",
            "Before going towards the HR or police route, can I suggest that you need to get some girls to teach him how to be assertive and say no. Find good practice from others to show him. Role play at break times in reverse, where he does similar to a girl who will then show him what she does and explain how she succeeds. He needs to gain confidence. Are there any local courses about this that he could attend? I guess these days there some stuff online too.\n\nHe needs the skills to defend himself, rather than 'cry' to management, or these sorts of things will happen again.",
            "That is sexual assault. It's a matter for the police and the assailant should be fired without hesitation. \n\nDON'T LET THIS SLIDE!!!",
            "Indeed. Look up the company policy on serious misconduct, look up the company process for raising a grievance and, for full belts and braces, look at what advice is listed on the ACAS website. \n\nWhen raising a grievance, it\u2019s important to be clear with HR on what he is grieving against. In this instance it would be that he reported a case of potential serious misconduct, namely \u2018X\u2019 (whatever is listed in your company policy), that was not appropriately investigated by management when reported. This inaction has made him feel \u2018Y\u2019.\n\nThe next step with the grievance is being clear on what action he wishes to be taken to solve the grievance. This would not be a Reddit favourite of \u2018omg they should be sacked immediately\u2019, he\u2019d be requesting something like an independent party following through with an appropriate investigation into the incident. It may also be whatever action needs to be taken to make the boy feel safe and at ease again (e.g. being separated from that team leader).\n\nStructuring it in this way will help HR pick up the baton on what should be done next and help them to understand the seriousness of the situation (if not immediately apparent). Don\u2019t listen to the numpty who says \u2018don\u2019t speak to HR, they only want to protect the company.\u2019 That\u2019s exactly what they\u2019d be doing in this scenario, protecting their organisation from the potential serious misconduct of its staff that has potentially been covered up by its management.",
            "In most companies HR is there to protect the company, not the employee. I would steer clear of HR in most cases *first i would seek external legal advice so you know your rights*\n\nEdit: wow a lot of negative and aggressive comments here. (Thanks to those who are polite and happy to debate/discuss). More info added for clarity.",
            "Suspension, investigation, and if the lad made a statement saying he was uncomfortable, ultimately dismissal.  \n\nI can\u2019t see my work place going another route.\n\nHow they dealt with this informally is a mystery. My guess would be manager was embarrassed speaking to a 50 year old women, didn\u2019t inform HR and chalked it up to banter.\n\nPretty fucked.  If that was 20 year old women this would make a local paper.",
            "It's sexual assault, company policy is largely irrelevant.",

            "This should be INDEPENDENTLY of going towards the HR/police route, not \"before\".",
            "This kind of response has been coming up more and more and while it is a good thing that people understand what HR is actually for, it does seem like we\u2019re at risk of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. There are problems that HR can solve for you - especially when the company\u2019s interests align with your own, as in this case. And if they can\u2019t resolve the issue, you\u2019re still free to pursue other options.",

            "While HR is there to benefit the company, it doesn\u2019t benefit the company to brush sexual harassment under the carpet and have that potentially get out into the public domain.\n\nIt\u2019s in the company\u2019s best interests to take these allegations seriously and deal with them appropriately. I\u2019d certainly be going to HR here",
            "This may be true for employee/employer relations but inter-employee relations can cause issues for a company. They won't want the potential fall out so they'll likely put a stop to it.",
            "HR's function is to ensure that policy and practice aligns with legislation. The reported behaviour does not align with legislation and the management response, I'm prepared to bet, does not align with policy. \n\nPeople are forgetting - in the UK, there is robust and effective legislation which protects employees. HR in the UK, unlike in the USA where no such protection for the employee exists (and most of Reddit's content is generated), ensures that these rights and protections are upheld.",
            "And in order for HR to protect the company in this case they'll want to do something about it. Having heard about this happening they need to protect the company from bad rep against sexual harassment by making sure it doesn't happen again. Imagine the backlash if it made the news that the company was knowingly letting it happen... Sometimes your own and the company's needs align and that's where HR works in your favour",
            "So are Finance and Comms but you wouldn\u2019t say that about them would you?",
            "As someone who works in HR I am absolutely sick of seeing this. Yes we are employed to protect the company, but that doesn\u2019t mean brushing anything under the carpet. If there\u2019s a case to answer any HR rep worth their salt will advise this. In this case I\u2019d be advising they speak to the employee, explain he is right and it has not been handled correctly, advise the grievance is on hold until initial complaint is investigated and should they not like the outcome then the grievance will continue. I\u2019d then suspend the female team leader as sexual harassment is sexual harassment regardless of gender and they\u2019ll be investigated.",
            "I used to be a manager for a well known telecoms company. HR did everything to protect the employee during any attempt to issue warnings or let go of staff.\n\n\nI cant speak for other large companies though.",
            "A good HR will understand that their role is to protect the company from legal trouble - which in this case means having a swift and decisive response to a sexual assault which doesn't involve telling the victim to just get over it because \"she didn't mean anything by it\".\n\nA bad HR is not a good metric for deciding your legal options.",
            "HR is there to protect the company, but at a far more holistic level than you're suggesting.\n\nAs such, it means stopping inappropriate behaviour like this, lest it give the company a bad reputation.\n\nIt also means not firing someone for something that they can then sue you for.\n\nOne of the big myths in retail is that store management is a big deal. They come with all kinds of titles - team leaders, managers, etc, but they're glorified low level supervisors who are just a couple of steps up from the very bottom rungs of the company.\n\nWhen my wife was promoted to store manager, she was concerned that she wasnt qualified to be a manager. Her regional manager snorted and said \"none of us are\". It's just a title with a couple of basic secretarial responsibilities like rotas and more fingers pointed at you whenever something goes wrong, but you're still as valuable to the company as a piece of chewing gum at the bottom of their shoe.\n\nHR won't blink an eyelid at taking action. The action will be petty - usually a demotion or relocation - but something will happen and it won't go against the kid here.",
            "It's up to the victim what they want to do. If they want a slap on the wrist because they didn't feel threatened that's a company policy angle. I agree with you though, they might do it to other people and it's entirely worth going to the police.\u00a0",
            "That's not quite true as there are ways of dealing with such matters correctly at a business. Ex there should be a route to raise a formal grievance as it clearly sounds like absolutely inappropriate behaviour. It would be reasonable to conclude that this could well lead to dismissal with such behaviour (and it may not be the first time this person has behaved in such a manner). It's important that internal processes are followed - but that the company also takes it with all the seriousness that it should.\n\nGoing to the police may also be an option / requirement, but don't miss out that there's a company process issue too that should be followed.\n\n(NAL but I have the misfortune from time to time to have deal with such matters in my role. Unfortunately, quick atypical Reddit reactions of 'go to the police' or 'get lawyered up' and the like are rarely helpful and can in fact be more difficult for affected individuals to deal with vs following what should be a well laid out and appropriate internal HR / disciplinary / grievance policy, that any vaguely respectable company should have - and is typically a lot less onerous than phoning 111).",
            "Thanks it\u2019s been super hard. Shes claiming sexual assault, her husband told people they can\u2019t wait for this to pay off their mortgage ( also have witnesses and statements) we\u2019ve spent a mortgage on lawyers. It\u2019s been insane.",
            "Just think of it was the other way around and it was an older male who slapped a teen girl on the bum. Gross misconduct and potential sacking right away. Other way around it's always down played until it hits HR as they understand it's the same no matter the gender",
            "I can only imagine it has and how much it has cost/put unwanted pressure on you both. What an absolute bitch to do that and then basically be rewarded for her behaviour. I only hope karma comes and smacks her really hard."
