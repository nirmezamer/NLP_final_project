        "content": "# I am NOT OOP\n\n#[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/s/KXXMbpjSr7) Posted 21June2024\n\nAm I the asshole for letting my daughter keep her room? \n\nMy (47m) daughter Stacy (15f) has one of the two rooms in my house with an ensuite bathroom. It's a largish room with a nice bay window, obviously very nice.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI've recently become engaged to my girlfriend of 3 years, Alice (33f), and her landlord has recently hiked her rent, so we're planning to have her move in with me. She has some kids. She has Two daughters (13F,10F), and two sons (11M, 9m). She is also pregnant, with our daughter due in about 5 months.\n\n\n\nI've made it absolutely clear to my daughter, as a condition of getting her approval on moving my girlfriend in, that she is allowed to keep her room, and she is also allowed to have a full lock on her door. For what it's worth, I also got my son's (24m) blessing to give away his old room, although that's more of a moot point, as he lives with his own girlfriend now. My daughter plans to go to school locally, and I have told her in no uncertain terms that she's welcome to live at home for the rest of my life, and after that she can inherit the house. I bought the house with her mother and paid it off in large part with her mother's life insurance 10 years ago, so it only seems fair. She says she's all right as long as she has her room and her bathroom and she's allowed to put a lock on her door. She has a toaster oven and a mini fridge in there, so I guess she's pretty well set up.\n\n\n\nStacy will be giving up a room that she's currently using as a studio/project space(she does art, videos and voice-overs etc) so even her larger room will become a bit more cramped, and she'll definitely need the extra space she has.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThere will be a bedroom for Alice's girls, Stacy's old project room, and Alice's boys will be getting my son's old room. I'm going to be putting in a finished nursery /bedroom in the basement for our new daughter.\n\n\n\nAlice thinks that this is unfair. She thinks it was wrong of me to make the decision without her, and she also thinks that she should move her two daughters into Stacy's room, and that Stacy should have to move to the smaller room that they'll be getting. The two of them already share a smaller room than the one I'm moving them into as it is, so they are getting an upgrade regardless. Alice thinks that it's not fair for Stacy to have a bathroom all day herself and that there won't be enough bathrooms for everyone else. She also disapproves of Stacy being able to lock everyone out. There were other smaller things she didn't like that I agreed to with Stacy, like the fact that she is to be paid for any babysitting, or the fact that my older car, her mom's old car, is hers when she gets her driver's license.\n\n\n\nWe'll have our own bathroom in the master bedroom, and the house has three other bathrooms besides, one on each floor, one near what will be her girls room, one not far from what will be the boys room, and one little basically be directly next to the new finished room.\n\n\n\nI told Alice that my deal with Stacy is non-negotiable; set in stone and that it's literally a condition of her even moving in. Alice is upset that Stacy and I both have spaces completely dedicated to ourselves. I have my office, which I need because I work from home and have projects besides, and there aren't a whole lot of other spaces to put people. I told her she can pretty much do what she wants in the living room, but that it is what it is and there's pretty much nothing to be done about it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nA bigger house is not an option unless Alice is going to start making a hell of a lot more money and buy her own bigger house. It's already a pretty big house, and housing is expensive. I told her that she's already getting a break by my only expecting her to contribute 15 or 20% to household bills. If we were doing it proportionately, it would be more like 25 to 30%. We keep separate finances, and we've agreed to a prenup.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAlice just seems upset that I won't change the setup even though there's no real way to change it, and she's accused me of treating Stacy like a \u201cspoiled little princess\u201d and letting her be \u201cqueen of the house\u201d.\n\n\n\nFrankly, my daughter comes first, she's lived here all her life, and I already know it's going to be a big adjustment having all these other kids move in. As much as I love Alice and as much as I want our relationship to work out, if it's a matter of choosing between the two of them, then my relationship with Alice is a sacrifice I'm willing to make. I've told her that if she comes into this with wicked stepmother vibes, and that'll be the end of things. She thinks I'm being unreasonable.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAITA?\n\n\n\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\u25aa\ufe0e\n\n\n#[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/s/7eKkbe87hC) Posted 1hr ago 22June2024\n\nUpdate: Am I the asshole for letting my daughter keep her room\n\nI got a lot of eye-opening insight and advice from my post, so I feel it's worth giving everyone an update, especially considering developments.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFirst, to address a few questions that seemed to keep coming up before I lost the ability to read each and every reply (although I'm still trying)\u00a0\n\n\n\nMy son (24m) is my child from a previous relationship before I met / married my late wife. He has his own provisions in my will, but he's quite aware that the house goes to his sister.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMy own sister is to become guardian of my daughter if anything should happen to me. I love my sister as dearly as I love anyone, and she and her niece love each other and get along great. I trust her completely if, God forbid, anything should happen.\n\n\n\nYes. The basement is an unusual place for a nursery, but I was just trying to make people fit where they could go. The move was supposed to be happening within a month, and Alice's older kids needed rooms now. Meanwhile the baby isn't going to be born for about 5 months, so she could go into the room that isn't made yet. I honestly figured we could keep a crib in our room for a bit, and after that it's no big deal for a kid to have her room in a finished basement. Also honestly, I didn't want to move my office. It's been where it is forever and I didn't want to move it. I can admit that. We've had the beginnings/groundwork of a finished basement since forever, but there was never any reason to really put a move on it. It was a big change to go from having more room than we need with just me and Stacy rattling around in the house to suddenly scrambling for space and to not having enough. It was the obvious spot where an additional bedroom could go, but not a spot where a bedroom is now.\n\n\n\nAlice and I had talked about marriage and children more or less in the abstract on many occasions, and we both wanted to get married, at some point, if things continued to work out, and I wanted to have more children, although this pregnancy was quite unexpected.\n\n\n\nIt was Alice's pregnancy combined with the rent hike on her place that accelerated the timetable on things. For what it's worth, the rent hike is real. I've seen the paperwork. And I have literally no reason to suspect the baby is not mine.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBut yes, the only reason why we got engaged so recently is because Alice got pregnant. The only reason why Alice and her kids would be moving in with me so suddenly is because she was likely to need to move somewhere, and I'd obviously like to be responsible for / be near / raise my coming daughter. To me, it made sense for my daughter to live with me. I never wanted to be an absentee/part-Time parent or to not have time or share space with my child.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe circumstances all made sense, at least until now.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI was definitely wary of Alice and paying more attention to her, especially after the many many comments that I read. I came to Reddit to get a sanity check on whether or not I was being an asshole about my conditions with Stacy, not to try to actually make any kind of major life or relationship changes. But I didn't want to turn a blind eye either.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt was Friday, and Stacy texted me, asking for her allowance. I was with Alice at the time, and I went ahead and let the subject come up.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI give Stacy $100 a week. Alice thinks that this is \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cexcessive\u201d. She thinks it's improper, and she's brought it up as an example of how she thinks I'm raising Stacy like a \u201cspoiled princess\u201d. She said as much again when I told her I was sending Stacy her allowance, but this time Alice also asked if her kids would get the same allowance after we get married. I told her that someday our new daughter would probably get an allowance just like Stacy does, but that there was no way I had any plans of shelling out an extra $400 a week for her other kids.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAlice got upset. She said that Stacy waste my money on shoes and makeup (she has previously criticized Stacy for wearing fancy sneakers, high heels, and makeup), and she said that I was showing favoritism and that that is a form of abuse. She complained about me letting Stacy buy things with my credit card and store my credit card on her phone when I don't even let Alice do that. She said that whatever money was going to go to the kids should be split evenly amongst them.\n\n\n\nWhen I shrugged and told her that that wasn't going to happen and that I wasn't going to cut Stacy's allowance, she snapped at me and said that a man living alone with his daughter and doting on her like I do is \u201ccreepy and incestuous,\u201d and she said \u201cYou've just replaced your dead wife with your daughter, and you need to stop.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat was it. Sure. I've ignored a lot of red flags up till now, but that was it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nShe started trying to tell me about how it's unhealthy for me to be so close with Stacy and how she didn't want her kids to be neglected, and how she wanted to be treated as an equal if we were getting married, but I interrupted her and I told her that I don't think we should be getting married.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI told her that I don't want her moving in and that we were going to need to work something else out.\n\n\n\nTo be perfectly honest, my sister, my brother, and some of my friends have expressed some of the same misgivings about Alice that I've read, although they were generally a lot more gentle about it. I was in love with her. In fact I'm still in love with her, and I wasn't seeing things clearly.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI told her that I would always and definitely make sure that our child had a roof over her head, but that she was going to have to work something out for herself and her kids on her own.\u00a0\n\n\n\nObviously, we had a huge fight. She screamed at me. She called me a heartless bastard. She blamed Stacy for trying to sabotage our relationship. She guilt tripped me about her cost of living and how I'm in an empty house all by myself. She also guilt tripped me about the stress on the baby, and I actually do feel bad and worry about that.\u00a0\n\n\n\nShe eventually broke down crying and told me to leave.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn the past 10 years, this was the first relationship with a woman I've had that became \u201cserious\u201d. I love her, and this hurts. It hurts a hell of a lot.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI told Stacy that she didn't have to bother moving her stuff out of the other room, that Alice wasn't coming, and we hugged. She asked if this was her fault, and I told her no. I told her I honestly feel like marrying Alice would have been a mistake even if the two of them could have been best buddies.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI always wanted to have a few more kids, and I've missed having a wife, but things don't always happen the way we want.\n\n\n\nSo I'm pretty sure my relationship with Alice is effectively over, even if we're going to be raising a child together for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\nMy new daughter can have my son's old room whenever we work out whatever custody agreement we end up working out. I'm not sorry to be having another kid, even if I really wish the circumstances could be better.\n\n\n\nThe red flags were always there. I guess it's better that I noticed them now instead of even later.",

            "Alice was using OOP to improve her and her children's lifestyle without working for it. Something similar happened to my cousin, he married a woman with 3 children, and went to live in her house with her children and her parents. After a short time he was paying the household bills and part of her children's expenses alone, which were her responsibility. And it only got worse when they had a daughter together. Unlike OOP, he ended up financially and emotionally neglecting his oldest biological daughter (from a previous relationship), who ended up staying with his parents, and they took on the child's upbringing and expenses alone. And today he still has the nerve to say that his mother (his father passed away) should give his biological daughter with his wife the same treatment she gives to the child she raised as her own since she was 4 years old (she is 19 now), after he abandoned her. I'm glad OOP remained loyal to his daughter.",

            "I was hoping OOP would see the writing on the wall via the comments, and thank god he did.\n\nAlice would *never* see Stacey as family, only as 'competition' that needs to be stomped out so that she can insert her own children into a 'real' family, and you can bet that when the baby was born, Alice would have been crowing to Stacey that her Dad 'replaced her' with a new baby, and that she (Stacey) was just 'leftovers' from 'that other woman'\n\nBut not Alice's own pwecious kids, oh no - no *Alice's* kids would be a 'breath of fresh air in a new family'. (I'm not speaking as if the kids themselves think that, but I know we all know Alice's type and how they think).\n\nStacey was also (to Alice's greedy view) a threat to the ATM supply that Alice sees OOP as.\n\nWhen the marriage came off the table, I doubt any of us were surprised that her mask came off fully to OOP. Alice went waaaay to far with her gross remark (read: screaming) about OOP and his daughter's relationship. \n\nShe lit everything on fire and then jumped in the blaze herself.\n\nOOP will have a slog ahead of him, and no doubt he'll get harassed by Alice's flying monkeys who got the 'he's a creep on his daughter' version of things from Alice.\n\nOOP needs to start screenshotting and recording everything now - shit like this can snowball badly.\n\nI wish him the best, when the chips were truly down, he stood by his daughter (not that he wasn't on her side to begin with). The security of knowing her father loves her and how much she means to him will go a long way to Stacey in this.",
            "Congrats to Alice for destroying the only chance she's going to get with literally the only financially secure single man with a big house who was willing to turn his life upsidedown and move her FOUR kids into his home. \n\nBased on her financial situation I have to assume her four children's dad/dads is/are deadbeats.\n\nWell done to OOP for recognising the toxic influence he was inviting into his home and shunning it before it was too late. Alice was obviously babytrapping him, and it almost worked.",
            "Man dude is strong but stupid for it to get this far, at least he got a sanity check and actually opened his eyes too it.",
            "I remember the original and I had immediately commented that there were too many warning signs from Alice\u2019s comments for him to truly feel safe living with her. In fact I said she would be making his daughter\u2019s life a living hell. He needs to get a paternity test asap- for the record. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she didn\u2019t get deliberately pregnant to help move up her timeline of joining their lives. Also why would he be financially responsible for her kids- where is her baby daddy? All in all, he gets a lifelong tie to her but at least it\u2019s not with marriage.",
            "If this were me, I'd get a paternity test and file for primary custody. That woman sounds unhinged.",
            "The relief after reading this update.  I was so worried for Stacey. Alice would have made that girls life miserable. \nA big round of applause for OP for finally putting his foot down and seeing the red flag.",
            "Under these circumstances I really feel for the newborn. Poor kid.",
            "I just saw this update! I commented that he should get a lawyer, communicate via text, record any calls and keep proof of any money he sends her.\n\nAnyone whose okay using a false claim of incest to try to manipulate someone is an awful human being.\n\nI also said I see a dirty lawsuit in his future.",
            "Talk about snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. She basically was getting an almost free house and chose the one hill to die on that OOP would never budge from.",
            "I'm glad OOP got away.\n\nBut the baby in the basement? Wouldn't it have made more sense for either the boys or girls to share that? When I was a kid I would have loved the private rooms",
            "I love OOP.  It shouldn\u2019t be this way, but after seeing post after post of people making excuses to let their partners mistreat their kids or having a new ready made family a year after their spouse passes, this was so refreshing.  When he said \u201cwicked stepmother vibes I wanted to do a slow clap.\n\nI don\u2019t really get the push for things to be exactly equal anyways.  These are not babies.  Of course you are going to treat your own kids somewhat differently.  They\u2019re your kids.  The stepkids have other parents.  It shouldn\u2019t be too lopsided but yea as a stepkid it never occurred to me that my stepdad had to give me everything he gave his own kids, because I\u2019m not his kid.  It\u2019s not like he\u2019s giving her toys she won\u2019t share.  The entitlement of expecting your new fianc\u00e9 to shell out 1600 a month (2000 for the months with 5 weeks) for her kids allowance which they don\u2019t get now so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re used to it.  Literally over *$20,000 per year*.  She\u2019s probably not even paying that much of the bills.    Not to mention her kids presumably have two parents, OPs daughter does not.\n\nThe ex really fumbled the bag.  She finds a guy that\u2019s a great dad to his own kids, happy to take her 4 kids on and pay the way but she\u2019s so selfish she still wants to take from his daughter.  She couldn\u2019t even hide the evil stepmother nature long enough to even move in.  She miscalculated: it\u2019s been dad and daughter forever and she\u2019s ain\u2019t special enough for him to lose his relationship with his daughter.  The fact that she literally told him he shouldn\u2019t be close with his daughter is mind blowing.  How can you be so dumb that after three years you clearly don\u2019t know this man at all?\n\nOOP really needs a paternity test.  The rent hike might be real but that just means that was why she decided to baby trap him.",
            ">She started trying to tell me about how it's unhealthy for me to be so close with Stacy\n\nAh yes, the unhealthiness of actually being close to your children The horror.",
            "She\u2019s looking for a sugar daddy for her and her kids, and what better way than to trap you with a baby, glad you opened your eyes.",
            "This is horrible. \n\nFlat-out, all of this is stupid and bad. How do people with children who start dating seriously and discussing marriage not immediately discuss having *five* children joined up?\nAnnnd a baby!. \n\n\nI think this is a story copied and altered from that other BORU about all the girlfriend's kids having to sleep in the living room while the daughter gets two rooms.",
            "Dodged a bullet there, OP.",
            "Oh man. I saw the post live yesterday and not surprised it ended up here so fast. It reeked of usage from Alice. So\u2026.I\u2019m glad op got out and that his daughter is safe.",
            "I'm glad he came to his damn senses,such a mystery why she keeps ending up alone. It makes me curious how her previous relationships ended.",
            "Three children with three different women.\nThis is kind of a red flag on his side. Especially having a child with a woman he obviously barely knows. He should be smarter at 47. And having a child at that age isn\u2019t always a good idea. \n\nI am glad that he isn\u2019t going to marry her.",
            "\u201cI, a person with one kid, got into a relationship with someone who had four kids, and we\u2019re having a SIXTH kid together. Am I the asshole for experiencing the inevitable consequences of this situation I knowingly put myself into?\u201d",
            "I\u2019m glad that you saw the light. Even though it\u2019s painful, you\u2019ve saved a lot of future heartache, for both yourself and your daughter.  I hope that the coparenting will go well.\n\nNagging thought. Are you certain that the unexpected pregnancy was a surprise to both of you?",
            "Evil stepmother just waiting for her Cinderella.",
            "I mean, I assume Alice is working now. Unless the plan was for her to become a SAHM, she could have used the money she saves from rent to give her children a comparable allowance and still would have come out in top. \n\nThe fact that she didn\u2019t come to that conclusion means she either planned on quitting her job without discussing it with OP or decided to work but bank all her money for herself. \n\nEither way OP was right to cut and run, especially after she made the relationship with his daughter creepy.",
            "OOP & GF were talking about marriage, but he wasn\u2019t getting with the timeline so she took things in her own hands by getting pregnant.  \n\nBut OOP needs to get his head together. It seems his entire family were concerned enough to tell him to hit the brakes and he didn\u2019t listen until gf showed her butt.\n\nBut also, he wanted more kids but those marriage talks really hadn\u2019t covered what it would be like to have what  6 or so children in the house, some of whom are treated  very differently in ways he hasn\u2019t even worked out.  (even though it is common for kids of different ages to get different allowances.) \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, he dodged a nuclear warhead but he was letting his looming empty nest syndrome and little head run his life.",

            "This is arrangement i have in mind: current house is belongs to stacy and nobody should have it.

But looks like this new wife have been planning to suck oop dries, just say byebye to her",
            "Wait. $100 a week allowance. Uhhh. Did anyone else get that growing up? My parents had my ass working when I turned 14. I still remember getting 4-something hourly.",

            "Right??? I was shocked that wasn't addressed.",
            "yup.",
            "Alice was an idiot. She had everything she wanted. She just needed to fucking chill. \n\nMy dad gave me $100 a week too\u2026 for allowance, and lunch money combined. My parents gave me my mom\u2019s car (she was alive) when I turned 16. I can promise you, privileged does not equal spoiled if you are halfway decent parents. Teaching a kid the value of money and hard work is the key. \n\nAlice is teaching her kids to spread their legs and find a new step daddy via surprise pregnancy. I\u2019m not worried about OOPS daughter or new baby. Those 4 kids though\u2026 yikes.",
            "Your analysis is spot on, brutal, but totally correct.",
            "I\u2019ve been thinking\u2026 that part about allowance, it could be that Alice was wishing for equity between the kids. She might\u2019ve wanted that happy ever after with each kid being given the same. Both hers and his. No differences. \n\nBut that would mean OOP would have to shell out a lot of money OR Stacey would get a whole lot less. Either way, it would be something negative for OOP\u2019s household. It makes sense Alice doesn\u2019t have that much money, with that many kids. But beggars can\u2019t be choosers.\n\nI\u2019m closer to OOP\u2019s position and I would understand if it was the wish for equity. But the way she went on about it is the worst way possible. Attacking someone\u2019s allowance choices as a single parent? Only having to pay 15-20% of the bills but expecting your FSD to switch rooms, while the new rooms for your kids will be bigger anyway? OOF.",
            "But he only woke up to red flags because Alice brought up the subject of \u201cyou spoil your daughter too much\u201d and \u201call children should receive the same treatment\u201d too early. If she had waited to address this after the move, OOP would have been tied up, since I doubt he would have kicked out his pregnant fianc\u00e9e, and his and his daughter\u2019s lives would have become hell.",
            "Honestly - four kids, no money\u2026 it would be best for all the children involved for OOP to have primary custody. Even if Alice (who yes we all hate) is a super mom\u2026 the kids she has will suffer with a new born in the house taking time, space, making noise, etc. The dad has a large support system and the money/space to give everyone, including Alice\u2019s four kids,  what is best for them by take primary custody",
            "He should also be prepared to fight sexual abuse charges since that is where she went previously. She will want a ton of child support and she\u2019s not afraid to go low when she\u2019s losing. I\u2019d hire a lawyer now and be ready to go for sole custody immediately.",
            "Oh for sure. Her kids and the new baby would be the only ones that counted, and his daughter would be Cinderella until she\u2019s 18 and gets tossed out. Alice sucks as a person and a parent.",
            "Do you have a link to that? The original was posted to a sub I'd never seen before on my feed, but my feed has been showing me all kinds of new stuff since Reddit went public. So I don't know if it's meant to be a satire sub based on recent posts or if this writer just copied someone else.",
            "Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. Not the one you posted, but the one from the perspective of a son who'd gotten a raw deal after his father married. It was similar enough in details that this feels like mining.",
            "To be fair number 2 died. Hardly a red flag",
            "If he were late 20s I would agree, but it sounds like he had a kid at 24, that relationship didn't work out then at 31 had a kid with his wife, who died when the daughter was 6 and got into a serious relationship 7 years later.\nI'm not saying it's a green flag, but this isn't a 25 year old with 3 kids under 5. If nothing else he seems to understand how birth control works.\n\nI'm not saying I don't see the issues with a baby at 47 but I think there are much more problematic issues in the world.",
            "And he wants even more children! He's in his late 40's. Time to appreciate what you have before adding ANOTHER baby mama to the list.",
            "This is a repost-sub, OP isn\u2019t the actual author of the post",
            "Same, but we were poor. My parents didn\u2019t have $100 a week for anything.",
            "You\u2019re right, I don't really like judging other women, but this whole development smells like a baby trap.",

            "My first thought reading this was, Jesus, stop having children.",
            "It's shocking that the OP STILL doesn't think he needs a paternity test. Like this woman can be absolutely deplorable in every other regard but not the cheating on him and getting pregnant by another man way.",
            "She's fine, she's in college now, she wants to be a lawyer like her grandmother.",
            "If you space them out right, you will always have one explaining modern technology to you.",
            "He can afford to take care of his kids though.",
            "If this was the only issue in an otherwise harmonious situation then I'd be happy to also genuinely encourage OOP to consider the implications of the lack of equity between the children, but the allowance issue was only one of a number of issues that Alice had with OOPs daughter. She put herself and her kids in competition with OOPs daughter in her mind. The argument over allowance was only the straw that broke the camel's back, Alice had already done plenty to show just how much she disliked the money, attention, and concern OOP was giving his daughter. Her kids can't just automatically get the same treatment, but OOP could've obviously gotten himself there as he clearly expresses in the post that he wants more kids, but Alice was doing nothing to help the situation along.\n\nWe can't discuss the allowance problem on its own, it has to be taken within the greater context of all of Alice's other words and actions.",
            "I agree, if she'd brought this stuff up after she moved in, her babytrapping plan would've worked. Heck, if she had waited a little longer and only brought it up after she was married to OOP as well as fully moved in, there would be no turning back for OOP as he'd be too deep in it to have any ability to make the snap decision to leave her, OOP would've probably eventually lost the house too in a divorce. Prenups are weak documents, and depending on your state or the judge you're dealing with, the court can just ignore it and give your wife what they feel is a fair divorce settlement - they will put the children and the mother's needs far ahead of the father or any prenup agreement in many places.\n\nThankfully OOP was able to partially dodge this nuke, he's still connected to Alice for the rest of his life through their daughter though. But even there, I'd highly encourage OOP to get a paternity test.",
            "I don't and I don't remember where it was.\n\nThe details that I recall:\n\n*Only daughter, dead mom.\n*3 bedroom house, teen daughter had two bedrooms because one was he study room because she has ADHD and wants to study (i think it was posted last year like 3 weeks before summer)\n* Gf had 3 or 4 kids, boys and girls, age range from like 9-16\n*Gf's apartment evicted her, they were facing homelessness\n* Poster refused to take away daughter's second bedroom for study reasons, ignoring that it was ALMOST summer\n* They were not close to marriage\n* Kids were going to sleep in the living room on couches.",
            "The wife sadly died, yes.  \n\nBut him wanting more children (plural) at his age with a woman he barely knows?",
            "Exactly.",

            "OOP should take legal action to ensure that the house stays with Stacy. He should put the deed in her name while he is still alive, because the will could be contested by Alice and her future daughter.",

The wedding was beautiful and everything seemed perfect until the reception. During the reception the maid of honor who has been my sister's best friend since childhood gave her speech. it was emotional and all but then she made a joke about how I was the family screw up who finally managed to do something right by not messing up my bridesmaid duties. Everyone laughed but I didn't find it funny.\n\nFor context I\u2019ve had a rough few years. I struggled with my mental health and dropped out of college for a while. I've since gotten my life back on track but it\u2019s still a sensitive topic for me. Hearing that joke in front of all our family and friends wasn't funny at all. My sister's best friend and I never really got along but still I never expected something like this from her. Especially the day wasn't about me at all then why bring me up in the speech?\n\nI tried to stay composed but I felt the tears coming so I quietly left the reception and went outside to collect myself. My sister followed me out and asked what was wrong. When I told her she said it was just a joke and she meant nothing bad. I tried to go back inside but I just couldn't and I ended up leaving the wedding early. My parents understand why I was upset but my sister is angry with me. I do feel terrible for leaving but I also feel like I had the right to feel hurt and humiliated.\n\nEdit: I said nothing at the moment because I didn't want to cause a scene on my sister's special day. And I can't reason with her right now because she will just ask me if I haven't been taking my meds lately because that's what she does when she's angry with me so I'm giving her some time to maybe realize how her best friend's joke was out of line.\n\nEdit 2: someone asked me if my sister's best friend and I argued before/did I give her a reason to do this. My sister's best friend and I never went past Hi. She told me before (few years ago) that she \"in general\" doesn't feel comfortable around someone struggling mentally because in her head God only knows what they're capable of. since she said this/to this day I just try to avoid her.\n\n**Relevant Comments:**\n\n*Info: have you given any reason for your sister or her best friend not to trust or like you? And if you have and aren't that person anymore, did you apologize for any of it?*\n\n*What she said was definitely petty for sure, but it may or may not have been deserved. And if you have hurt your sister and never apologized for it then you really don't have any leg to stand on to ask for an apology for someone else making a snarky comment about that.*\n\n*However, if your sister and her friend are just cruel for cruelties sake then you absolutely are NTA.*\n\n*I do really wonder what the other side of the story is here.*\n\n>Actually my sister's best friend and I never went past Hi. She told me before that she \"in general\" doesn't feel comfortable around someone struggling mentally because in her head God only knows what they're capable of. And since she said this to this day I just try to avoid her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update - 7 days later**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHi. Thanks to everyone who took the time to comment on my post and gave their opinion/advice without being too harsh. I apologize if my update is messy or confusing. I'll try to cover everything but I don't know when to add context for clarification. If you think there's any missing info/some parts are confusing let me know.\u00a0[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/AQpuIf1DX6)\n\nThe same day I posted my dad called to check up on me and see if my sister and I had talked things out. When I told him no he said it's better if we talk about it now and assured me that I have nothing to apologize for. If my sister thinks she has nothing to apologize for then the least she can do is make her best friend apologize or fully realize that the joke was out of line. By the way my brother and I met 4 days ago and he told me that BIL (my sister's husband) didn't like the way the MOH called me a screw-up in front of everyone and some of those who laughed voiced later that they did so out of nervousness.\n\nOn Monday my sister called me to talk. When I made it to her place, her best friend was on the phone and didn't put it down for a second. My sister started by saying that just a few years ago I would have laughed hard and not taken the joke as an insult. I told her maybe some laughed because they don't know the reason she called me a screw-up.\n\n(For context. When I was 16 something happened and that's why I struggled mentally really badly between 16-18. When I was 17 I was diagnosed with PTSD and later with depression and anxiety. Since then I don't like it when someone touches my head. Especially my hair and the back of my head/neck. My sister knows everything)\n\nDuring our conversation my sister did most of the talking. At some point I felt like my sister had called me just to blame me again without trying to understand my perspective. When I tried to talk she put her hand on the back of my neck and pulled me toward her with each sentence as if to say \"Do you understand?\" or \"Okay?\" I hated it and felt irritated. I honestly kept thinking if I pushes her away would I be in the wrong. Would they just call me mental and tell family I got physical. I tried to leave but she insisted that no one was leaving until we sort this out. She told her best friend to just apologize. She refused and reminded my sister that I was the reason her husband got angry at her on their wedding day because I couldn't take a joke and when I tried to explain why (EDIT: I told her if she had focused her speech on the bride/groom then maybe he wouldn't have had a reason to be angry. she refused to listen and brushed my words off) she said \"Yeah whatever. Sorry\" I was glad it was finally over and as I was about to leave I heard her say \"Can't take a joke that everyone knows is true\" Both of them laughed but my sister stopped mid-laugh and apologized. I didn't say anything and left.\n\nI think I've had enough. I mean I know I've had a few rough years. I dropped out of college for a while, fine. But I've since gotten my life back on track. My parents helped me through it all and never made me feel like a burden. At first, I was on some strong meds that made me feel tired/sleepy most of the time. After a while I started to feel a little better with therapy and my family's support. During that period it was me, my parents and my brother. My sister was three hours away for a job and used to visit sometimes and would often bring her best friend along with her. Looking back. I don't want to say she hates me but I know she felt ashamed to have a family member struggling with mental health issues. I don't know how to explain this.\n\nI've made up my mind and decided to go NC for now. If my parents and my brother who were there when I was going through it all never made me feel that they're ashamed of me then why would she? I'm still on some meds but feels much better than before. I have a stable job, my own place and friends who loves me for who I am. I can say I'm proud of myself a little. I love my family to death and tried to maintain a relationship with my sister all these years but I'm trying to improve myself not constantly be reminded of what I was a few years ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*New Update starts here\\*\\***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update - 13 days later**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHey. This happened a few days ago but It's been a busy week for me and I was a bit hesitant to update.\n\nI went to see my parents with my brother. My dad texted me before to to let me know that my sister was coming too. I didn't want to cause any problems between her and my parents by telling them about what she and her best friend did. But when she started the conversation with lies. I told them everything and made it clear that I'm not asking them to take sides and that I will still come to family gatherings but I won't engage with her in any way.\n\nMy dad couldn't let the fact that she grabbed me by the back of my neck slide. But my mother tried to make it seem like it was out of desperation, to make me accept her apology. What my sister said next did it for my mom. She asked them how is anyone still supposed to remember what exactly triggers me after all these years and that I already gotten over it since I didn't react. And what if I've been faking it all these years. I know I shouldn't have said this and I really regret it now but I told her I wish she go through exactly what I went through. Maybe then she could give me a better example of how I should've handled it all. She told me to get over it and stop begging magazines to post about what happened at the wedding and left. My dad told me later that her best friend's younger sister read about it in 'People' magazine. it was posted on their Instagram. And (get over it?) she's the only one who still brings up what happened.\n\nMy mother now understands why I decided to go no contact. My dad and brother are 100% supportive of my decision. But I can't stop thinking about what she said. She tried to trigger a reaction out of me and now thinks I've been faking it because I didn't give her one. It's been 11 years. Years of therapy and meds, of course I've gotten better. Not 100% tho since I felt irritated. And if it wasn't for already being labeled 'crazy' I would've shoved her away.\n\nI feel like I should've cut contact with her the moment she asked my parents why I didn't stay at the party and wait for my brother to come and pick me up. The reason I left the party was because some of the guys who were invited were much older than I was and they were getting drunk and loud. Two of them followed me. First thing my sister told my parents was and still believe that I left with them because I was naive and just scared/ashamed to admit it. Even after both of them confessed everything. But I was young I guess and cutting contact with her wasn't something I could do.\n\nI also want to mention how supportive my partner has been through all of this. From the day I told him everything. He has been incredibly understanding. Even though I never asked him to and he never told me but I know he still goes through each movie/series before we watch it together to make sure there aren't any scenes that could make me uncomfortable. When I put something on. he finds a way to distract me for a few minutes to check it before we watch. He has never made me feel like a screw up. He makes me feel like I still deserve to be loved.\n\nThank you to each of you for your kind comments and reaching out in private\n\nEdit: There's something else that happened in the last few days but I can't mention it. Since they found out I posted on the internet from 'People' magazine's Instagram. I assume they searched for the original post here on Reddit. I don't think I'm doing anything wrong though. I didn't mention any personal information in my original post or updates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SuccessfulSeaweed385**\n\n*It's so good to know that you have supporting parents and a fantastic partner. Hope your sister grows up one day, but that is probably unlikely.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Juggletrain**\n\n*Hey there OP, and anyone else that may need to know. If you go to doesthedogdie.com it not only tells you if a dog dies in the movie, but lists any other possible triggers including SA. Might help your bf to search through there too.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Loose-Chemical-4982**\n\n*I'm so glad you were able to tell your family about what your sister did, and that Dad and Brother support you 100%.*\n\n*I'm sorry your mom tried to make excuses for her, I suppose she didn't want to believe her daughter could be so cruel. But I'm having a schadenfreude moment here because your sister outed herself completely.*\n\n*Your sister doesn't really understand PTSD and chooses to remain ignorant and unkind. You don't owe her any performative behaviors to get her to believe you. She's really gross to victim blame you for what happened.*\n\n*She's just angry and lashing out again that you \"should be over it\" because the post got national attention on an infotainment media outlet and her husband will most likely see it.*\n\n*I truly hope he does.*\n\n*Be well. I'm so happy that you have a supportive partner that goes the extra mile to keep you safe.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\***Reminder - I am not OP**\\*\\*",

I am next of kin legally and also would like to state for the record that me and my father had an excellent relationship. She never mentioned the policy to us or wrote down on her form that my father (did not) have children which it clearly asks and instead sent the form as if she was his only relative.\n\nThe company found out that I existed only because I am the informant on his death certificate and has asked if I wish to make a claim. I contacted my aunt about this and she has doubled down and said that my father would have wanted her and her alone to receive this large sum of money and has told me not to put in a claim.\n\nI am putting in a claim regardless and told her this and it has caused a huge rift with her family. So much so that a cousin contacted me and said that my dad would be ashamed of me for putting in a claim and then went on to attack my autistic 24 year old brother, telling him that my father would have been ashamed of him because he was unable to carry his coffin at the funeral.\n\nIt just seems that this has gotten completely out of hand and I along with my brother are being attacked over money. Surely the company wouldn\u2019t have contacted us if it were his wishes to give her 100%.\n\n(Edit: I also forgot to mention that my aunt said she received an email from my dad\u2019s workplace saying it was his wishes to gift this money to her and she had a signed document from him saying this, but when I asked her if I could see the document she sent me a blank template of wishes from the company website which had no writing on it, no expression of wishes and no signature from my dad which is confusing.\n\nWe also told her that we may not receive anything in the final decision which we are fine with, but it potentially could be split even between me, my younger brother and her. She wasn\u2019t happy to even consider it going three ways either. And that is where the abuse began from that side of the family.)\n\nI just don\u2019t know and this has been keeping me up at night with stress. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE:** \n\nI phoned the company this morning and they have NO RECORD of an expression of wishes that my father wrote. Only that she was next of kin at his workplace. So she not only lied that it was my dad\u2019s wishes for her to have this money, but she also lied that she received an email from the company stating this. The woman on the phone said you are his daughter, you have a right to make a claim. And also to tell my brother to put his claim in which he will be doing now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FairyPenguinStKilda**\n\n*NTA - she is robbing an Autistic child of her own brother?*\n\n>OOP: Her daughter sent my brother vile voice notes telling him that my dad would be ashamed of him because he couldn\u2019t carry the coffin due to his autism, that he is lazy and should get a job when he can\u2019t work and that he is a thief. It has made my brother so distraught that he is refusing to put a claim in as he thinks my father hated him when this is not true.  \n>  \n>My dad loved the bones off my brother. Those words never left his mouth. All lies.  \n>  \n>My dad may not be here to protect him but I am, and I\u2019ll always protect him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BeardManMichael**\n\n*NTA*\n\n*Your aunt's family sounds like a bunch of greedy assholes. Do not let them bully you. Make sure you get the benefits that you are owed.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Beth21286**\n\n*Why would she even think she deserves it when dad has TWO children?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*Judgement - NTA\\*\\***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update - 2 months later**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHi everyone, I just thought I would give an update on the situation.\n\nMy aunt put in a claim to receive my father\u2019s death benefit from his workplace in April behind our backs and stated that my father had written wishes for his money to go to her and her only. She said she had a copy of an email with his signature signing over 100% of this to her but when asked she never sent us a copy of these supposed wishes.\n\nWe later found out this was a lie, there were no wishes and the only reason she was able to put in a claim was because she was listed as next of kin at his workplace. Not as a beneficiary of any kind. This caused a huge rift within the family (you will see details from the original post, and also a second post on my profile) and ultimately ruined relationships that will never be repaired.\n\nEven when we offered to split it three ways, she wasn\u2019t having it and doubled down on the fact this money was hers. Then her family began attacking us over social media.\n\nMy brother and I received nasty abuse as we put in a claim, were told my dad would be disappointed in us, that he would be ashamed and that the payment was to go solely to her. My brother who is autistic was told he was disgusting for not carrying my dad\u2019s coffin, even though this emotionally would have destroyed him beyond repair. \n\nHe was told he was nothing like my dad and that my dad called him \u201ca shit son\u201d which is a LIE. He is an amazing young man, and my dad would have been proud of him for even being able to attend the funeral. And also for cutting his hair for the first time in 11 years to make our dad proud. I\u2019ve reminded him of this as these nasty words have stayed with him, causing him emotional turmoil thinking that my dad hated him. He is getting better emotionally now with support from me, my mum and close family friends and realises our dad had nothing but love for him.\n\nWell, after a couple of stressful months I\u2019m happy to say that my brother and I received everything, and she got nothing. Not a penny. We have not split the money with her and will never speak to her again. My brother will live comfortably now, and will be taken care of which is what my dad really would have wanted.\n\nThank you to everyone for the support in the original post who put my mind at ease and reminding me that I was not in the wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**popcorn717**\n\n*Everything turned out the way it should have. I am happy for you and your family. Your aunt got what she deserved...nothing*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SoCalThrowAway7**\n\n*My petty ass would send her the breaking bad gif of the two guys laying on a pile of money. But that\u2019s a very bad idea in reality, I\u2019m happy you\u2019re away from this lunatic and her family*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I am not the OOP.

He survived and is doing great these days but it really shook him so he started discussing inheritance etc. He told us the bulk of his will is split three ways to his three kids with my uncle getting a smaller share as my Grampa bailed him out from bankruptcy in the past. Then the grandkids get a little bit each. However my mums share will be split between my siblings and I as our mum died when we were teenagers.\n\nUncle first tried to claim he should get an equal share to his sisters. Then said my mums share should go to him and my aunt. Then that if my siblings and I got mums share we don\u2019t deserve any of the grandkids share. Luckily my Grampa told him to shut up or he\u2019d cut him out completely.\n\nThen my sperm donor popped up and tried to claim he deserved mums share. He was an abusive dick who kicked me out the day after my mums funeral. None of my mums family have spoken to him since my youngest sibling grew up and moved out of his house.\n\nThis was all happening whilst my Grampa was laying in a hospital bed hooked up to life support.

It\u2019s causing major issues. How do we solve this?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - My wonderful BF has an odd soon to be sister in law that, I feel, acts inappropriately towards him and it makes me uncomfortable. We\u2019re trying to figure out how to deal with this in the least dramatic way possible so this doesn\u2019t go on forever.\n\nMy BF and I have been together almost 1.5 years. This is the best relationship I\u2019ve ever been in. He\u2019s a great person and we have no issues, except for his brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. When I first met her, I really wanted for us to be great friends, but that hasn\u2019t been the case.\n\nLiterally the first time I met her, she was wearing a romper, came out of the bathroom, specifically went to my BF to zip her up (butt to neck). I thought it was odd but we\u2019d just met so I didn\u2019t trip on it. Before I\u2019d met her, he described her as his \u201crelationship advisor\u201d and that he told her about me and how excited he was about our relationship. But each time I\u2019ve seen her (almost weekly in the 1.5 years), she\u2019s made me uncomfortable. She\u2019ll pull him away to talk one on one. She touches him regularly, has little inside jokes so I just sit there like an idiot, makes silly voices to him, makes weird double entendres jokes to him.\n\nSometimes she\u2019ll be super nice to me and sometimes she just straight ignores me. I never know which version I\u2019ll get, so I always act super friendly, but it\u2019s exhausting. One of the last times I saw her, she was being friendly, but did take the opportunity to say \u201cYou know, before you and XX started dating, we talked every day about all kinds of things. We were best friends. Now we don\u2019t talk as much anymore.\u201d\n\nIn the beginning, he seemed oblivious to how inappropriate she acts towards him. I\u2019ve pointed it out several times and gotten to the point where I told him if he doesn\u2019t shut down her weird touching, I\u2019m either walking away or leaving because I\u2019m uncomfortable. Issues with her have literally been our only relationship drama the entire time. We have never fought about anything else. Since making him aware, a lot of times when she starts touching him randomly or trying to pull him away, he\u2019ll resist, go somewhere else, whatever the case may be. But we seem to have an argument after each time we see each other.\n\nYesterday, she and the brother received an invite from a mutual friend to see some live music. She was mostly fine, friendly etc but she chose the seat beside him (so I had to sit a couple friends away from him) and was wiping his face, touching his face where he missed a spot shaving, weird stuff like that. At one point I just walked away and chatted with mutual friends. \n\nAfter we left, I expressed to my BF that I feel I can\u2019t talk to him about my concerns with her because he gets so frustrated and says she\u2019s always been that way, they\u2019ve known each other for 5 years, she\u2019ll be his \u201csister\u201d soon, whatever. He\u2019s doing his best to keep her in check but she does seem to come out of nowhere with her touching, and her snide comments to me that maybe only another woman could understand the rudeness behind. It turned into a loud fight, the likes of which we\u2019ve never had. He\u2019s super apologetic today (he made a hurtful comment in the heat of the moment and I\u2019m sure I did too out of pure frustration with this situation.)\n\nThough I don\u2019t like her, knowing that we\u2019ll both (hopefully) be part of the family soon, I know we need to sort out these issues. How do we go about doing this? I\u2019ve thought about going out for drinks with her and explaining my situation so she can\u2019t play dumb to how she makes me uncomfortable. He thinks he should talk to her solo, but that feels like I can\u2019t handle my own issues and would create more weirdness between the two of us. I absolutely love and want to marry him and really want this to resolve so our relationship can continue to flourish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA - my last relationship before this one was awful, cheated on, verbal and physically abused. I\u2019m incredibly grateful to have the good man I have now. It took me a lot of work to get to where I am emotionally, to be able to trust, control my anger in arguments etc just because of the last one that was so awful and changed my personality. I don\u2019t want to see bits of the old me anymore, but I see little bits when we argue about her and I hate that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cocoasneeze**\n\n>\" She was mostly fine, friendly etc but she chose the seat beside him (so I had to sit a couple friends away from him)\"\n\n*What did your boyfriend think about that? His SIL sat beside him, flirting with him, and you had to sit further away from him? Why didn't he tell her he'd like to sit next to you?*\n\n*It seems like your boyfriend is OK with her behaviour, he's not shutting it down. And when you call this inappropriate behaviour out, he fights with you. So he's not planning to shut it down at all. He's fine with the status quo of you just walking away and his brother's wife flirting with him.*\n\n*As often as you see his brother and his wife, this seems like a huge issue actually.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Absoma**\n\n*Sounds like he likes the attention doesn't it?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**grumpy\\_\\_g**\n\n*I am a sister and a SIL.*\n\n*This is not ok.*\n\n*And he doesn\u2019t shut her down. He just avoids her.*\n\n*Don\u2019t talk to her. Embarrass her in front if her partner. Don\u2019t you have a friend who could help with that? As a friend I would ask \u201eHey OP, is that over there your fianc\u00e9 (BIL)?\u201c And then act surprised when you say it\u2019s him (fianc\u00e9). \u201eOh really. With all the touching I thought it\u2019s her.\u201c*\n\n*What do the family members (BiL and parents) say about it? Have you ever talked to BIL?*\n\n*Edit: Don\u2019t marry till this is resolved.*\n\n>OOP: Thank you for your response! Sometimes I get so annoyed with myself like why am I making this an issue? But none of his close friends\u2019 wives or GFs act this way towards him. And I also can\u2019t imagine he\u2019d feel great if I was acting this way towards another guy.  \n>  \n>I haven\u2019t talked to the BIL about this. He can be nice, but is very work and himself focused. Honestly I get vibes from her like she feels she picked the wrong brother and regrets it. I\u2019m not trying to shame her or cause more of a scene that I already seem to do when I walk away in a huff (she\u2019s noticed it). But yeah, I agree that he needs to shut her down more than he\u2019s been doing or this will continue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update - Massive family blowout with my (30F) BF (29M)\u2018s family. I was the target. No clue how to proceed. - 5 days later**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is an update from my last post. TL;DR on the last post - my BF\u2019s (maybe) soon to be sister in law has always exhibited inappropriate behavior towards him (super touchy, possessive, raunchy jokes, tries to shut me out). My BF sent her a text saying it made him uncomfortable, requesting she reel it in, and hoping they can continue to have a good relationship. His brother (30M) got involved, screamed at my BF, said hurtful things, very dramatic. That was it for a week.\n\nNow for the updated craziness. Friday Evening I went to a female family gathering. Future SIL was there. She avoided me the entire time. I want nothing more than to get past this and move on, but was sort of following her lead and left her alone. She texted asking if we could talk. I said sure.\n\nShe said my BF told his brother I wrote the text (he never said that). She clearly didn\u2019t believe me and kept trying to find ways to prove that I wrote it. That I said no more family gatherings and we don\u2019t want to go to their wedding because I hate her. That I\u2019ll hate any future child they have because it came out of her. I was absolutely shocked because I never said any of this, and I know my BF never said any of these things either. So his brother is making up these cruel lies for some unknown reason?? She said how awful their family is and all she wanted was to make me feel included and now I\u2019ve stabbed her in the back. She demanded an apology. I refused and told her to have a good night and left.\n\nSunday, we go to the parents house for dinner. All of us were there. Things were fairly standoffish. At one point I was inside with future SIL and the dad, making light small talk. Their mom grabs me and future SIL to speak in a back room. She\u2019s a few drinks in, gets all teary eyed that her boys are in turmoil. Basically saying I\u2019m the root of all the issues so I need to get over it because she\u2019s not having her family torn apart. My BF loves both of us equally (hah!) and I need to deal with that because they\u2019ve known each other (5 years) far longer than we\u2019ve been together (1.5years). I can\u2019t come in and try to dissolve all female relationships in his life. She left and future SIL and I were talking calmly and I was expressing there clearly was miscommunication between the boys that seems to be ramping this up. She agreed.\n\nThen we hear screaming from the living room, glass breaking, so we go out there and that\u2019s when all the real drama started. The brother kept pointing at me with like a legit murderous look in his eyes, calling me a manipulative B and a psychotic bully, all kinds of things. It was a screaming match everyone telling each other to fuck off and his mom is like \u201cwell you started all of this and now you have nothing to say? Defend yourself\u201d His brother is like \u201cshe\u2019s playing a game. She manipulated my brother away from the family so she\u2019s sitting there all pleased with herself, the Fing dumb B.\u201d\n\nThe mom was trying and failing to moderate this because the brother kept screaming. He was telling her to go F herself, saying any awful thing he could think of about me. He came incredibly close to my face (idk if he wanted to hit me or intimidate me), my BF pushed him away and yelled at him. The brother kept making these moves like he was going to run at me, future SIL kept holding him back or telling him to take a walk he was furious. Their mom kept saying I need to grow up and deal with my insecurities, kept saying that over and over. At one point I asked her to stop calling me insecure and she said it was the first time I\u2019d defended myself and now she respects me a little bit because I stood up for myself.\n\nThis went on for 2 hours and because I don\u2019t deal with issues by screaming and name calling, I was frozen. My BF was saying a lot to try to defend me, that they were his concerns and didn\u2019t come out of thin air, which riled everyone up more. It was absolute chaotic madness that I\u2019ve never been a part of before.\n\nAt the end, their mom tried to laugh off the entire thing. I was in total shock because I\u2019ve tried so hard to be kind and respectful to the fam and always had a great relationship especially with their mom, so I was taken aback. My BF spoke to his mom the next day, cancelled all future plans with the fam, saying I was attacked, it was uncalled for, he was furious. His brother has legit issues and the mom makes excuse after excuse for his absolutely terrifying behavior.\n\nI seriously don\u2019t feel comfortable even being near his brother again. He sounds so close to really losing it and I\u2019m actually concerned for my safety at this point. I thank god my BF has the complete opposite personality. But I have no clue how to move forward from this. As much as I\u2019d never want to see the brother again, I know that\u2019s not possible. I\u2019d be willing to speak to him if he could act more normal and calm but I don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s capable of that. Help\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WinterFront1431**\n\n*Sounds like brother is projecting here. Maybe he too thought she was highly inappropriate with your bf, and now it's been brought to light, he has to face his feelings and is taking it out on the wrong people.*\n\n*Also bf mom sounds like a fucking idiot.*\n\n*Doesn't matter if she has known him for 30 years. She was incredibly inappropriate. End of discussion. You're his partner. Doesn't make you insecure because you have boundaries and don't think it's appropriate for someone to act like your partners gf.*\n\n*The only way forward is for him to go complete no contact with his family.*\n\n>OOP: Thank you! That\u2019s how I feel too; there are sibling relationships and romantic and the lines should not blur. The fact that everyone is blind to it and making me feel like I\u2019m crazy is unsettling. Unfortunate timing, today is my bday. His mom dropped off a card and present for me. No interest in the present (almost feels like an attempt to buy me off so to speak) but I opened the card out of curiosity. \u201cWe hope to have better memories with you in the future.\u201d This is after spending nearly every weekend and holiday at their home, missing out on time with my own family, doing my best to forge the best relationship possible I can with his parents. What a kick in the nuts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**abbyroade**\n\n*There is no way forward unless your boyfriend goes NC with his family. His brother is dangerous and mom has shown she will enable and excuse him when push comes to shove. If boyfriend will not cut them off, you need to leave this relationship for your own safety.*\n\n*ETA: I just reread your first and this post. The way the family attacked you for things you never said is scary - where did that come from? Someone must be making something up. Also, the fact that mom has the awareness to say to you she respects you because you stood up for yourself for the first time shows she\u2019s manipulative and doesn\u2019t care to change it. This family clearly thinks it\u2019s okay to handle disagreements by yelling and threatening - so again, unless your boyfriend sets strict boundaries and enforces them, there\u2019s likely no way forward.*\n\n>OOP: The enabling is kind of insane! He showed me the text conversation with her where he repeatedly said there\u2019s something wrong with his brother, he\u2019s always acted this way, but it seems like it\u2019s coming to a head and he needs help before something serious happens. My BF said if he said a quarter of the things the brother said to me, his brother would physically try to attack him. Brother is in a professional medically adjacent field so very risky for him to act so unhinged with his license on the line. The mom was like \u201che was just defending the woman he loves. He always feels strongly. Oh, you\u2019d never say those things to (future SIL), you loveee her! Everyone needs to simmer down and give sincere apologies to each other.\u201d If my son talked to a woman like that, he\u2019d be backhanded into next week. She\u2019s an old school country girl so it shocks me that she allows this and excuses it!  \n>  \n>When all the yelling was happening, it became apparent that both future SIL and brother had lied to each other about a lot of the details (probably a mix of them both contributing to the lies about what I allegedly said or did), which looking back on it now is almost laughable.  \n>  \n>I\u2019ve gotten very close with the rest of the family over the course of our relationship including a handful of female cousins (guess I didn\u2019t try to dissolve those relationships), who basically acknowledged brother has always been a massive issue, the rest of the family avoids the couple because they\u2019re rude, mean, he\u2019s condescending towards women, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**symolan**\n\n*Is drama a tradition in that family? Cause it sounds like it. (because in non-drama families nobody is screaming for 2 hours)*\n\n>OOP: Yes, it\u2019s common for them. I\u2019ve seen the brother cuss out the mom and get this crazy before, and the next time I see them, they\u2019re fine. I\u2019ve just never been in the line of fire personally so it was pretty shocking for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I am not the OOP.

            "I would cut and run from that family so fast. Can you imagine raising children in that dysfunctional mess? Yikes. OOP is lucky, she's not married or even engaged to him at this point. Cut your losses, girl. \n\nIt also sounds like she's made a lot of effort to get to know his family, at the expense of spending time with her own.\n Which likely means he's put in zero effort to build relationships with her family. Combined with his non-efforts to shut down his creepy SIL, he seems like a real dud. She's gone to a lot of effort for the relationship and it's not reciprocated. Why bother to stay, at this point?",
            "*insert Ralph Wiggum \"I'm in danger!\" meme*\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBF sucks, but his while family is insane, and though the details are thin, it sounds like he was trying to defend OOP, even if it took a whole fuckload of drama to make him get off his ass and stop the SILs obvious bullshit.\u00a0\n\n\nOOP should be seriously considering whether she should tolerate this, how much she had to beg him to even try to get SIL to not openly flirt as much, and if she wants to be linked to this batshit family",
            "So let\u2019s see if I can get this straight. SIL is attracted to and has feelings for her future brother-in-law. She has been relentlessly flirting with him for years, and ramped it up ever since he got a serious girlfriend to mark her territory. She is doing this shamelessly in front of the girlfriend which likely also means she\u2019s doing it in front of her fianc\u00e9, but he is likely in denial about the whole situation situation, likely out of jealousy over his brother.\n\nBoyfriend sent the text message trying to shut this all down. Future sister-in-law realized that her game is about to be over and that means she no longer gets to have her dalliance and her behavior may yet properly recognized by the fianc\u00e9 or the family at large. Once that door opens, she\u2019s going to be held accountable for her actions for the first time and that can\u2019t possibly happen. she whips up a fictional account of how the girlfriend is trying to break up the family. She probably shows the text message to her fianc\u00e9 and says it\u2019s a girlfriend\u2019s doing.\n\nIt is highly likely that the fianc\u00e9 quickly comes to a realization that his future bride wants to bang his brother. This creates a schism in his mind he can\u2019t deal with that fact, so instead, he buys into the lie and goes after the girlfriend. It is far easier for the family to blame the person who has been around for 1.5 years and the person that has been around for five years, and since one has already proposed, she\u2019s clearly the one that gets to win this fight, so the mother chooses her.\n\nMeanwhile, girlfriend, having dealt with a history of trauma and abuse, does not rush to defend herself and is therefore presumed guilty. And boyfriend brother is incapable of properly dealing with any of this because it is now blatantly obvious that future sister-in-law wants to bang him and admitting that today means admitting that he probably knew for a long time and let it happen anyways. Which therefore means he does not have the kind of relationship with and respect for girlfriend that she deserves.\n\nThis is a massive mess and the actual only solution here is for OOP to run far away. She needs to disavow every single person in this situation.  This is a perfect example of everyone in this situation except her being in a state of \u201cyou need fixing and I hope you get fixed, but I\u2019m not responsible for babysitting you until you aren\u2019t broken anymore.\u201d",
            "I would love to know what the real story is with the relationship between the brother and SIL. Like were they trying for some sort of open relationship with his own brother? I just don't understand how he could be so cool with his fiancee flirting openly with his own brother on the regular. And who's making up which lies? And where did Dad go in all of this? Just sitting on the couch drinking a beer and watching this Jerry Springer episode live in his living room?",
