The kids looked like they had fun in anyway.",
            "No worries, I just thought I\u2019d ask in case you or someone else knew! I did find some info, can\u2019t post the link for some reason, but some beaches have much more foot traffic and this can contribute to the fragility of the dunes. So I suppose in less populated beach areas, the structure is much stronger because the plants that hold the dune together aren\u2019t constantly trampled on.",

            "Interesting, seeing his younger pictures yesterday for the first time, I thought \u201cwhat a handsome man\u201d \n\nMy mother did this to me too. She fucked me up gooooood that 18 years later, at 30 years old, I still struggle with everything she taught me about how I look. \n\nIt started when I was 6 and I had a beautiful friend come over and play. On paper, we were exactly the same; brunette, long hair, round face, fair skin, light freckling, big lips, round nose, and just a teensy bit chubby, nothing major. But she was the pretty version of me. All her features were just *better*. My mom was obsessed with her. Always fawning over her, and how beautiful she was, and how sweet and charming she was. She would dawn over her when she\u2019d come over, and for the next week, she would be all she would talk about. \n\nThen the summer before junior high(middle school), we were doing family pictures and my mother was like come here, I want to pencil in your eyebrows. I was like no I\u2019m good. She\u2019s like no want them for the pictures. I had never touched makeup, and didn\u2019t want to. My mother had always spent 2+ hours on her hair and makeup everyday and I always thought \u201cwhat a waste of time\u201d, especially when I thought she was much prettier without it. After some arguing, she finally got me into the bathroom and pencilled in my very light eyebrows. \n\nThe next week or two, she comes home with mascara and says here, I got you this. I\u2019m like I\u2019m ok thanks, I don\u2019t want it. And she\u2019s like all the girls in jr high are going to be wearing it, you\u2019re gonna look weird if you don\u2019t. So I tried it, and I admit I thought it looked fantastic. \n\nThen a couple months or so later, I have a couple teensy tiny pimples here and there. Teenage stuff. I didn\u2019t notice them.  At. All. She starts analyzing them \u201coh geez, you\u2019re breaking out, hmmm I\u2019ll have to get you something for this, sheesh\u2026. Wow your dad and I never had acne, where is this coming from?? \u201c Over the course of the next couple months, she buys every different drugstore face wash and cream. Nothings making it disappear.  I\u2019m getting incredibly insecure. I see a commercial for ProActiv on tv and I\u2019m like I NEED THAT because apparently my face is just too hard to look at. So she orders it\u2026 and it destroyed my face. ProActiv is for people with severe acne, not a couple tiny pimples. It messed my skin chemistry up so bad I turned into an absolute disaster. Massive, painful pimples all over my forehead and cheeks. Scarring. \n\nSo then she comes home with coverup, foundation, powder, because my skin is so unsightly. And I won\u2019t go anywhere without it. I\u2019ve now stopped going to the pool, which I LOVED. I won\u2019t let my family see me with my makeup off. I have to have my foundation and eyebrows on. \n\nAnd I stayed like that, hidden under a layer of makeup, from age 13 to about 28. Around 28, I started being ok with taking my dog outside for a pee with no foundation on, just my eyebrows. Then I was ok going for walks. Then to 7-11. And now I\u2019m mostly ok without it. \n\nBut no one has seen me without eyebrows drawn on since I was 13, because of my mother. Not any roommates, no friends, no boyfriends. I used to slept with them drawn on until a few months ago.",
            "It sounds silly but I feel very seen by this. I have often felt disgusting and ugly, and there have been times in my life where I have hidden away because of it and I often feel ashamed and embarrassed by my body and looks. The people around me have often found this silly or ridiculous, or not being able to understand, but, as silly as it sounds, I can't leave my appearance at home. I live in my body and with my face every day. It's a person's first perception of me. Everybody looks at each other and assesses each other's appearance. It's very painful to feel like you are unattractive or ugly.\n\nI'm not sure physical attractiveness is something I would ever have even thought about in regard to Mr Sutherland, so that helps.",

            "I read once that as a parent, what you say to your kid becomes their inner voice, and that resonated so much with me. I have a cousin who, like Donald Sutherland, grew into her looks. When she was young, her mother was ruthless and said so many damaging things. It has had lifelong affects on her. I try to be very mindful of what I say to my child because those words stay with you.",

            "My mom sucks too. Why even have a kid?",
            "This is the very first time that I hear about this and his \"unattractivness.\" I always thought he was a handsome man, with strong, recognisable features perfect for the roles he played. Shame he didn't feel the same way. Shame his mother didn't reassure him. May he rest easy.",
            "Watching that broke my heart \ud83d\ude22",
            "This is fucking wild. I have always thought of him as a very attractive man. Fuck that woman.",
            "How devastating. I always thought he was soooo attractive. Tbh I thought he was hot as hell in pride and prejudice and I almost never like older men!! How sad he had to live with that pain. What a beautiful man inside and out.\u00a0",
            "My first formal dance was homecoming my freshman year. My mom was too busy to help me with my hair and makeup so I did my best on my own. I put on red lipstick and curled my hair and felt pretty. She took one look at me and laughed until she cried. She said that I looked like a clown with painted on red lips, she called me ronald mcdonald. she said the whole school wouldn\u2019t look at my outfit they\u2019d see my big goofy red lips glowing in the dark (i have fuller lips and was teased for it often). Went into the bathroom in tears and scrubbed that lipstick off so quick.  \n\n15 years later, I still cant wear bright lipstick because to me I look like a clown. I love you mom but\u2026it will always hurt",

            "This is crazy because I was just looking at pictures of him last night and was kind of surprised by how hot I thought he was as a younger man. That long hair and the beard? Looks don\u2019t matter at all compared to how you treat people and carry yourself in the world (which Donald seemingly did an A+ job at) but I do understand how that could be so hurtful and damaging for seemingly an entire lifetime.",
            "He\u2019s not ugly at all :/ horrible that our parents can do this to us",
            "Geez, I never looked at him and thought he's ugly!  I guess I saw him as an older actor, but very versatile. He's played the \"good guy\" characters as well as the \"evil\" ones.",
            "Ahhh, this brought tears to my eyes. Every single thing I hate about my physical appearance was pointed out to me by my father when I was a teenager. At 44 I still think about how to disguise my \"gross\" features every time I leave the house. I can't imagine feeling that way and being on screen.",
            "That makes me furious for him bc how can a parent say or imply that their own child is ugly?",
            "I think Anderson reacted strangely. *obviously* it stayed with Donald. What a dumb question to ask. And then to laugh when he replied \"only 65, 66 years...\"",
            "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder - physical attractiveness is quite random. Charisma and a great personality will do much more than physical beauty - that\u2019s why he was a successful actor \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Can\u2019t two things be true at the same time? His face DOES have character, and he is handsome too.",
            "So if you're an ugly or unattractive person, you know this about yourself. Being told you're ugly by someone else really just hurts and cuts deep. You obviously feel bad about being ugly and hearing it from others just confirms it. I think you also feel guilty and embarrassed that you can't do anything about it really. You instantly feel like hiding so you don't have to bother or upset others with your appearance.",
            "This breaks my heart. I\u2019ve never once thought of him as unattractive and I hope he had people in his life who loved him enough to tell him his mother was wrong.",

            "Oh god bless you. You wonderfully talented and handsome man. Rest in peace \ud83d\ude2d\u2764\ufe0f",
            "I never thought Donald Sutherland to be ugly, or unattractive. I always thought of him as have a distinct look.",
            "That\u2019s so sad and I honestly can\u2019t understand how any mom could think that of their kid let alone tell them that. I look at my daughter and I think she\u2019s the most beautiful person I\u2019ve ever known.",
            "I just googled him and from pictures that I assume were his 35-45 years, he is a good looking man. Fuck yo mama Donald.",
            "...only 65, 66 years.  Great delivery.  A Canadian icon, will surely be missed.",
            "Oh, Donald. I have a very pretty sister. I remember as a child asking my grandmother if I was pretty. She paused. Then said, you have regular features. Devastated me. When I look at photos of the time I was actually quite pretty, not in my sister's league, but not ugly like I thought I was. When my niece asked me the same question I told her she was beautiful and so was her sister. They actually are but I would have said that anyway. Be careful what you say to kids, we remember.",
            "This hurt my heart",
            "His mom was so cruel, no child deserves that. It\u2019s amazing how what adults tell children just stays w you. I have my own pain from being told awful things by people of authority(teachers and parents). It sucks how it ends up shaping your life and how you see yourself in the world.",

            "I\u2019m thinking about this. There are better ways she could have put this to him. Mr. Sutherland has a distinctive look, attractive but not normally so. Perhaps his mother was attracted to the more traditional of which her son never was. My own mother can be like this. It\u2019s a good looking face, just not traditional handsome. And if you look close, at his son Kiefer all the structural elements of his father\u2019s face are there, just softened a little. And who doesn\u2019t think that boy is hot?",
            "Mothers! M51 my mother said similar hurtful things when I was a kid. It has stuck with me my whole life.",
            "As a guy, I never thought he was ugly or unattractive. He was one of my favorite actors",
            "Goddamn, that hurt MY feelings.  Except for that 70s perm he was a very attractive man wirh a sexy voice. And his acting always felt so real.",

            "It can go the other way too - my dad spoke of how beautiful I am and how intelligent my sister is. Very much focused on the respective traits in terms of praise. \n\nShe is arguably more intelligent - she got a great degree from Oxford & is skilled at everything she touches, whilst I have often been complimented on my looks & know I am objectively attractive but my god does that fuck you up when you believe your worth is based on something so vapid & fleeting as your appearance",

She also put me in runway modelling as a kid and praised my \u201cflower face\u201d which is when I\u2019m basically my ideal weight and she felt my smile was at its best. \n\nShe\u2019s gone now and we had some discussions about the hurt it caused. She had her reasons, mostly she didn\u2019t want me being focused on my \u201cbeauty\u201d but she kind of made it impossible to like myself without having those words ring in my ears.

            "Once, I was watching a ballet preformance on tv with my mother and I casually said that I would have loved to have done ballet as it was so elegant.\n\nI kid you not, my mother looked me in the eye and said \"you never had the figure for it. Your sister however...\"\n\nI'm a US size 4 btw. That still hurts to think about.",
            "My mum was an phenomenal artist and regularly critiqued my childhood artwork with things like, \"Well, the idea is okay, but the legs are all wrong and the shadows need to be darker\" and fuck me yes it hurt at the time.   \n\nBut she cared about it and wanted me to get better at things and I did. Cruel to be kind sometimes works in the end. My sister can't sing and had no hope of getting better at it because she's tone deaf and she was told that too.   \n\nSo I heard Donald's mum's response as well-meaning, y'know? 'No Donald, make no mistake, you aren't conventionally good-looking BUT...' and I can hear love in \"Your face has a lot of character.\" Donald Sutherland was so great, one of my favourite actors. I met him once outside a Montana's or Outback or some roadhouse like that, we were both waiting in the pouring rain for someone to pull the car around.",
            "I'm in the singing being a skill you can learn camp. Not only that, even how you speak can be changed. The hardware is connective tissue, cartilage, and muscles that can be trained, but it's a fine motor skill which many people don't have the patience for. Sometimes there are problems with singing which could be resolved if diagnosed. - some people have an undiagnosed tongue tie which means when theu speak or sing, the tie requires more work to move everything and it's not just your tongue, but connective tissue all the way to your throat which is moved. If those muscles don't move well together, your voice will crack. That happens when a voice changes in the teen years, things grow and coordination needs to be learned again.",
            "I\u2019m sorry this happened to you.  A mother who would do this to her own child obviously loathed herself.  You were the innocent target of her self-hate.  It was all about her, not you.",
            "I know the feeling",
            "Stuff like this is why I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not/will never be a parent. Like my beauty standards are legit different than the mainstream. I could genuinely compliment my kid, but know they might get made fun of outside. I\u2019d have no idea what to do.\n\nSutherland is honestly handsome to me, especially with a beard. But knowing he doesn\u2019t look like Marlon Brando (someone whose looks are conventionally cerebrated)\u2026 how do you stay honest with them without hurting their self-esteem?",
            "I has 4 aunts that drilled me in female etiquette  when I started junior high .I really did learn a lot from those ladies,how to sit ,eat properly dress properly ,talk properly  and call me on behavior they didn't like .My best friend and her sister were not allowed to dress themselves .Their mom picked out all of their clothes and laid them our each night in high school .Her mom thought girls dressed too scandalous for the times.They dressed like catholic high school girls and wore those private school outfits in a public school!They did get teased in high school because their outfits never changed.",
            "great line",
            "I LOVE him in Pride and Prejudice - he was a perfect Mr. Bennet and I have always loved the father/daughter chemistry he had with Keira Knightly. He's very stoic throughout so much of the movie but his warmth and affection for Lizzy has always been one of my favorite parts of that adaptation in particular.",
            "He was really great in the Hunger Games movies .",
            "We never know what we say will hurt and leave lifelong scars. And the worst part is we may hear it from unbiased sources, but it\u2019s almost impossible to override that core initial memory.\n\nAnd it hurts to hear that pain.",
            "Yes, he was very striking. Not ugly in the least.",
            "Exactly. I'd say he is good looking. His face did have character, in a good way, and he was so charismatic. I think he was an objectively attractive man, as objective as something like being held attractive can be. Which is to say, not very. But to me, he was. \n\nWe have to watch what we say to little folks. They really take it in. Can you imagine being such a talent as Donald Southerland and carrying your mother's unkind and untrue words with you forever \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",
            "Same here. Like in \"Ordinary People,\" it never seemed odd to me that he and someone as beautiful as Mary Tyler Moore were paired up.",
            "I always thought he was handsome! Loved his eyes and smile, plus his voice! I\u2019m an elder millennial and grew up seeing him in so many things.",
            "Mine probably are annoyed with me. I tell them so much. I was considering stopping.  But after this interview? No. I\u2019ll never stop. Poor Donald. I had no idea he was carrying that.",
            "He was very distinguished looking to me! Definitely not ugly at all.",
            "It is interesting because when he talks about this memory you see his face change to that of a kid? Does it make sense? It is like his inner child coming at the forefront to show us how hurt he was.",

            "Yesterday\ud83d\ude22",
            "IMO he was one of those men with very strong features (elongated face with large nose/ chin) that tend to look a bit awkward when they\u2019re younger, but become a lot more attractive as they get older. A good beard usually puts these features together nicely. For reference, see below: \ud83e\udd75\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h6x4timxtz7d1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b330385e0a7f3e684e29f0b37f3bccab8489adc\n\nBut I get where he was coming from. The Hollywood stars that his generation grew up with were those clean-shaven pretty boys, and that\u2019s not exactly his appeal. Also, there\u2019s the factor that being above average in the real world is the equivalent of being a disfigured abomination in Hollywood. Being around all these gorgeous people 24/7 will no doubt mess with your self-perception.",
            "****THANK YOU**** I have always thought he was handsome! Crazy",
            "Exactly. His smile is lovely, his eyes are striking, and I personally think his larger ears are super cute. His mother's statement likely had a lot more with her insecurities which is a shame.",
            "His mother had no right to talk about anyone\u2019s look.\nMaybe she was self projecting?",

            "The movie yeh. He was her watcher, Merrick.",
            "Exactly. I try so hard to show my daughter that I love myself and my body. We talk about foods that make us strong vs foods that make us just feel good in the moment instead of good or bad food. I try so hard not to gossip about other people and to shut it down when family members start those kinds of conversations. I try to answer her questions honestly and respectfully when she notices people who look different or are differently abled. I just want her to be comfortable in her own skin.",
            "My parents did the same thing. I actually had someone at work recently ask me why I never sing... Everyone else jokes around and sings. I work in a restaurant. I said it's because I've been told I'm tonedeaf my whole life. Even drunk, I refuse to do karaoke. \n\nThey also used to sit me down and tell me that I was adopted, as a joke. Super funny upbringing.",
            "I\u2019ve always heard that but honestly can\u2019t believe it for me own case. I can\u2019t hit high or low notes, my voice is pretty nasally and I\u2019m definitely tone deaf. I can\u2019t imagine ever sounding decent but it\u2019s a nice thought!",
            "I mean there's being technically good at singing, like hitting the right notes, but then there's also having a nice-sounding voice which not everyone can have tbh. But there are a lot of famous singers that do not have nice sounding voices! (Van Morrison for example)",
            "Some people can\u2019t learn it though because they\u2019re tone deaf. Like you need to have the basic ability to hear pitch etc (which most but not all people do) and then build up the skill from there",
            "The hardware for musical ability develops really young, from in utero to the first 18 months of life. If you cant hear tones well after that point, you never will.",
            "Ooof. My mum told me that while she loved me, she didn't like me. And then she wondered why I left home and got married while still in uni.",
            "Man some of yall have some mean ass moms \ud83d\ude2d I\u2019m sorry! Such a cruel thing to say.",
            "My husband is the same way and it brings tears to my eyes that he cares enough to build me up to increase my confidence. \n\nI do have a good singing voice, but my Mom was overly critical and always belittled me, so I still have an intense fear of singing in front of anyone. I even tried out for honor choir in high school, and placed in one of the 5 open spots. There were 76 other people who auditioned, and you\u2019d think that would build my confidence, but no.",
            "If my opinion is not hurtful, just want to provide the option of looking at your mom\u2019s feedback as constructive criticism and not cruelty. There was real evaluation from her, praise for the effort and result and suggestions for improvement. Even support to learn how to improve. \nCruelty, on the other hand, would have been to not even bother to evaluate and given feedback that completely crushed your confidence and stopped you from trying again with zero support. \nOf course, this doesn\u2019t invalidate your feelings in response to your mom\u2019s words and your reaction to \u2018negative\u2019 feedback (that isn\u2019t destructive) builds resilience to the world you would be interacting with in the future.",
            "I think it also depends on the age of the kid. No one should be hesitant to tell their 7 year old they are beautiful because really there's no point being critical even if you think their face 'has character' since they can grow to look very different anyway.\n\nThen again I can't imagine being brutally honest with a teen when their self esteem is most fragile. I guess you have to try and raise kids to know their worth is more than just looks. I'm not gonna tell someone with a big nose that their nose is small though, for example. I suppose there's objective features and subjective beauty. You're right though one of the many many reasons having children would be walking a tightrope lol.",

They made the jokes anyways and the Dean came by their dorm (south house) to punish them all and Donald lost it and hurled the sink at him as he was leaving.\n\nThe Bob\u2019s still an annual tradition at UofT.   The nature of the jokes told has been lost to history, I\u2019ve heard a few different versions of it, but the general consensus is the Bob that year was in favour of the civil rights movement, in favour of admitting female students to their previous all boys dormitory, and in favour of helping draft dodgers out of the Korean War.",
            "This is a very good point. He definitely didn't 'fit' aesthetically with that era of Hollywood but damn the man was fiiiiine (a million thanks for the picture).

I tried so hard to get better. I got slightly better. But my mom never listened to music when I was a baby and I wasn't in environments where I'd hear it very often, either."
