            "Properly started **Unicorn Overlord** on the hardest available difficulty and am now about 40 hours in. Oh boy is this game good. I can't stop thinking about it, I've been moving units around in my dreams. It's so well structured, with long main and sidequest battles broken up by little liberation skirmishes, and so many recruitable units provide a near constant dopamine drip, which also means there's always something new to experiment with. Everyone knows the story is pretty cut and dry, but I've been surprised a couple times by interesting sidequest moments, and I do think the localization probably elevates it.",
            "**SMT VV**\n\nIts so good, hours fly like nothing when playing this game! Forgot how great it is and the new features like the QOL demon fusion stuff and the new demons in early game makes it a fun experience so far.\n\nNice to play with my favs like Mermaid and I'm also happy I chose the Switch, since it used my save file to give me the essence of my best demons!",
            "Mostly Xenoblade Chronicles this week.\n\nI've reached the Nopon Village and I'm about to fight the Telethia blocking the road in the corner here. The Eryth sea's a pretty neat visual, wonder if it'll get explained more later. I've finally swapped my party around and put Dunban and Melia in play to try and raise some more affinities. I figured Melia was either gonna be like a cleric or a holy mage, didn't expect the typical elemental mage. But she plays a lot different than most mages, partially due to Xenoblade's combat, partially because she needs to summon elements before she can attack with them. That's kinda neat. I've also finally looked at the Collectaepedia, filled in basically everything but the Bionis's insides, but there's nothing to gather in the Third Lung anyways. Riki exists, he's got a lot of funny armor sets. I hope the story gives him a chance to prove his worth. The party's kinda just dunking on him and he's not doing anything to make me not agree that he's a bit lame. His skills look fun at least.\n\nAnd I played a little bit of Tokyo Mirage Sessions - found my first sidequest that seems too challenging for me at the moment, rescuing some girl's performa from a monster in the Shibuya dungeon. And got to look at the Daitou TV dungeon, only got to do the first loop around and broke down a wall. This place is neat. Eleonora's nearly caught up in level to the rest of the group, definitely looking forward to teaching her more skills. She's not much help with session chaining right now.",
            "For the first time since...well before the pandemic anyway, neither of my two active games are JRPGs (Tears of the Kingdom and Disco Elysium).\n\nI just finished **Octopath Traveler**. Sort of. I didn't finish it. For those who don't know, it is because they locked the ending behind a lame time consuming boss rush followed by a superboss. No saving. No warning of the extreme difficulty and unavoidable need to grind beforehand. Terrible design choice. Forgivable 30 years ago when that's just how games were, unforgivable today. What a shame. That's all I have to say about it.",
            "**Tales of Arise**\n\nI've beaten the 5 warlords and done a bunch of side-quests. Now, I just got enough of the fighting system. It's very repetitive and I prefer turn-based. I've used a lot of DLCs and turned the difficulty to Very Easy so I can avoid as many enemies as I can and just rush through the game. The story is nothing amazing, but I still want to see the ending and craft more weapons.",
            "**Skies of Arcadia Legends**\n\nI've just crossed the South Ocean to reach Ixa'taka\n\nI've been told by a lot of people on different occasions that the Skies of Arcadia setting and tone would fall in line with what I love in JRPGs. And well, at least so far they are absolutely right. Sky pirates, floating islands and airship combat? Sign me up. I don't know why I didn't give this a go sooner honestly.\n\nI don't have too many thoughts about the plot itself, but I really like my party members, Vyse and Aika in particular, and the dialogue and interactions between them have been great. \n\nCombat has been mostly fun so far. Really enjoying the boss battles and the variation the occasional airship combat brings. I wish combat animations in general were a bit faster tho. And way too many encounters have enemies with insta-death spells, I don't find this a fun mechanic in general, but their hit rate is also really high, I think I had one or two misses at most so far. Aika does have a move to block them tho, so it's not as bad. Encounter rates have been good for most of the game, but crossing the South Ocean was a pain.\n\nAlso, I can't help but notice how Nostalgia (the DS game) had a clear inspiration from Skies of Arcadia in a lot of ways. I always thought that game had a bunch of good ideas that weren't well executed, so I'm glad to have at least the airship combat already being better here.",
            "Recently finishes **Valkyrie Elysium**, I thought it was a fairly solid action game. Story is fairly weak, alongside the characters. Gameplay is fun, but can get a bit repetitive. I recommend it, but not a game to play all at once. Playing a main story chapter or a couple of side quests in a day was what I found the most enjoyable balance \n\n3 chapters in to the switch version of **Paper Mario The Thousand-Year Door**, love the game and the remake is great! Great way you get into the Mario rpg games\n\nStarted **Final Fantasy VII**, about 4 or 5 hours in (I just finished the Sector 7 sequence) and I am loving it. It is wild how fast paced the Midgar section of the game is. My only full experience in the FF7 universe is Remake, so it has been delightful to see the differences between the two, and how remarkable both versions of Midgar are!\n\n*edits are to fix punctuation and such",
            "I had a completely free day Thursday, and with all the hype around SMT Vengeance, I decided I'd get it even though I was skeptical of the need for it after already playing SMT5. Searching PSN is when I discovered the game didn't come out until Friday. Whoops! I kept browsing and ended up getting **Soul Hackers 2** for $14.99.\u00a0\u00a0I've now got about 10 hours into it and must say I'm enjoying it. It's definitely scratching the SMT itch that I clearly had. Same great gameplay- the only real difference is the use of 'stacks' rather than Press Turn. Game seems very solid.",
            "As a big fan of SMT V i'm playing **Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance** of course. 10 hours into the Canon of Vengeance and i'm now on the >!Lahmu fight at school!<. I'm really loving the changes in the CoV so far (can't speak for the quality of the story changes yet tho) and the QoL improvements have also been great. Absolutely loving it.\n\nIt's also just great to have this game run at (mostly) stable 60+ FPS. And the image quality looks better than on the original Switch version too.",
            "Having an amazing time with **SMTVV**! Didn't actually finish the original version, but I went with Canon of Vengeance for my first playthrough of VV. So far, things have felt easier than the original? But I may have just gotten very lucky against Hydra (it literally missed Nahobino nearly every turn, lol). Worst thing so far is, like the original, unique skills can make fusing more painful. Like goddamn has Mermaid's ice skill been helpful, but I'll of course need to fuse her away. Looking forward to seeing how CoV ends up diverging (besides how it has so far simply with meeting Yoko).",
            "I've been enjoying Trails to Azure when i have the time, just finished chapter 2. I gotta say that the story is already getting pretty hype!",
            "Pokerogue and it\u2019s super fun and addictive",
            "Monster Hunter stories.   \nThe DS version was technically my first MH and I'm really enjoying returning to it on Steam with a new appreciation for the monsters as I've played several mainline titles since.",
            "I'm playing **The Last Story** and I like the game so far.I prefer using my money to upgrade current weapons unless I find new equipment in dungeons and to me the best part is the ability to shoot enemies that are out of reach with zael's bow.",
            "I'm playing SMT Vengeance on Steam Deck.  I finished Vanilla SMT 5 on Switch and it was fun but underwhelming compared to previous installments.  \n\nI just finished the first area for the Vengeance route. The early game is a lot smoother than what I remember of Vanilla.  Hydra is still a bit of a crapshoot, but I had a lot more wiggle room this time. The player gets several buffs while Hydra seems to be unchanged.  \n\nHere's a list of all the buffs I noticed:\n\n-New heroine has excellent magic stat and can take the place of a demon.  Also, she can use items just like the hero.  You have more flexibility with your demon fusions because the heroine can pick up the slack. \n\n-Protagonist gets a lot more stat points to play with.  After several plot points, Aogami gives a little \"I'm proud of you\" speech and you just get 3 custom stat points right there.  Normally, level ups give 3 fixed stat ups and 1 point to spend freely.  You can crank your offense stats way harder than you could in Vanilla. \n\n-Every Demon has a new passive skill. Most are niche, but it's free stuff that wasn't in the original.  For example, Mermaid has a new passive that adds more hits to multi-hit attacks when you use Magatoki.  It stacks beautifully with a physical protagonist.  \n\n-Level penalties have been dialed back.  There's less risk of missing attacks against bosses above your level.  \n\nI hope the game gets harder though.  The new bosses have been easy so far.",
            "50 hours into Persona4 Golden,  Just started the 4th Dungeon (not counting the liqueur store). Fairly solid game pretty sure I screwed up the SLs for some random non party characters so I\u2019ll do a replay eventually.",
            "**Romancing SaGa 2**: getting into the groove with brand new party after the first long timeskip, just got done with the Cumberland succession quest. I like how there are so many small branches in each quest, feels like playing a CYOA book in JRPG format. Even doing really minor thing like speaking to Character A before Character B can lead to significantly different events; good thing I'm not too hung up on getting the best outcome, it's not that fun to check a guide every 5 minute or so (\\*that said, I already missed out on the fireball spell at the very begining and the entire thief plotline). Also wish the remaster add more QoL stuff in terms of narrative, like a quest list/character bio/plot summary just to make it easier to keep track of stuff. Dynamic NPC dialogue, like in Ys games, would've been great too.... break the immersion a lot when you still have the same citizens reciting the same lines after 100-year skip :v\n\nCombat balance is wack in annoying but kinda fun way. I got blindsided and party wipe'd by random mobs that put most of party to sleep and poisoned them. Reset, and wiped the floor with the boss of the same dungeon, whom I stunlocked + confused to death without ever getting the chance to do much. Just typical RS2 stuff I guess.\n\n(e: oh wow, a remake of this has just been announced lol)",
            "**Octopath Traveler** I've been playing this gem and feel it's just one epic moment after another!\n\nDoing a series on my first playthrough too :D [Let's Play Octopath Traveler || EP 03 || Conquering the Blotted Viper: Epic Boss Battle](https://youtu.be/Cs8S3AZSyUU)",
            "Spoilers: FFVII Rebirth finally finished after 150 hours (I did most of the sidequest stuff). Even without the sidequests the story is convoluted and just messes up the amazing OG story. Removing Wutai and Rocket town was especially nasty.\n\nOther than that its great. I will give it 9.4/10.",
            "Just beat the Tokyo Tower demon in **SMTV: Vengeance**. I am about 6 or so hours in. I am reminded how much I liked this game, only now this time I like it more with all these cool little changes they have been making so far. The inclusions of Demon Haunts, travel rails, the ability to save anywhere, demon passive skills, new demons, excellent resolution and framerate, and way more have already made a great game into an even better one, and I haven't even delved into the meat of the new story path yet.",
            "Playing through **Ys 8: Lacrimosa of Dana** and it's been pretty good so far. The concept is pretty novel (at least for me) and I really like the way they use insults, straight up calling people a pain in the ass and a blowhard lmao.",
            "**Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth**\n\nNear end of chapter 4 and I'm loving it! Sujimon is a lot more fun than I expected too",
            "I played an hour of **Saiyuki Journey West** this morning. It has been on my list for quite a while and it's pretty fun so far. The animations are sweet and I love the portraits. Also I'm always happy about TRPG goodness.",
            "I\u2019ve been slowly working through Dark Souls Remastered. Beat two of the Lord Souls and then got stomped by a doggo, so I took a break to not get frustrated. It\u2019s\u2026 fine. Good at parts, irritating at others.",
            "I\u2019m 120 hours into SaGa Emerald Beyond. For many JRPGs, that means reaching end-game and running out of fun things to do. Here, I feel like I\u2019ve only done half the things the game has to offer, and it still feels fresh and exciting.",
            "Shining Force II\n\nIt has a pretty fun chess-like combat system and you get like eight characters in your party. Unfortunately most of the games over-world looks exactly the same.",
            "Playing SMT V Vengeance. Only 10 hours in, just beat Nuwa. I never played the fiend DLC in the original game, so I know I got a lot of new content omw. I'm not sure if the game is easier, or if I've just hit a point where I know how to exploit the game,  but even on hard, I've yet to die to a boss. Kinda hope that changes soon.\n\nI like the new female charater so far, she definitely seems like a chaos rep. I'm hoping the new story beats start happening soon.",
            "Finished **SMT IV: Apocalypse**. I liked the gameplay a lot, the changes from SMT IV were good and made the experience better. But the story was a step back. Felt like someone looking to Persona's writing, but didn't understand why that worked. \n\nStarted **SMT: Strange Journey Redux.** I have wanted to try this game before, but the talk about difficulty and such made me hesitate. It's also like 50 hours which is the longest SMT game for me so far. I just got done with sector 2. The gameplay is something I had to really get used to. CO-OP makes me think differently when I build my team. Still prefer Press Turns, but it is interesting. Also not a big fan of the fusion system here. It's true that this game feels on the harder side. I didn't struggle with the early parts of SMT IV, but here I did. I like the plot and setting. Curious to see where it goes.",
            "Started the Windows remake of **The Legend of Heroes III: Prophecy of the Moonlight Witch**. The game is quite basic. Dialogues are short and there are no treasure chests which makes field exploration pointless.\n\nEnemies encounters are not that common, but the combat is interesting. It's uses a real time system similar to many others found in the genre like 13 Sentinels. Easier enemies can be beaten by auto battle but stronger enemies require a lot more micro-management. My only complaint is that the game doesn't let players select a specific skill to use.\n\nThe story has many similarities with Trails in the Sky. The game has enough structure to be interesting but it doesn't have so much complex worldbuilding that goes over my head like in many recent Trails games. Sometimes you just need a good old fantasy adventure and this is exactly it.",
            "**Troubleshooter: Abandoned Children** - Finished the base game in my last comment during a previous week of this thread on Cruel Difficulty + High Risk High Return in about 79.5 hours. I spent another 27 hours just to complete the first free DLC story content which was amazing as well and I'm still making my way through the second and final story DLC. I did decide to take a break as the long battles + testing builds has begun to tired me out a bit so it'll be a while before I return to complete. **9.5/10**\n\n**Tales of Zestiria** - About 19 hours in where I'm at the Trial of Fire or Shrine? and I really just wanted to play some ARPG and thought I might as well start Zestiria. I've played 3 \"Tales of\" games at this point, and I'm also part of the group that played Berseria prior to Zestiria so I think that'll add to my enjoyment of references (although it has been over 4 years since I played it. So far it's probably the game that has had the weakest hold on me but I'm also sure it's because I've been influenced by negative reviews/other opinions on the game. The beginning hours felt like a bit of a drag (probably due to the lack of movespeed + sprinting option) and even as more areas have a opened up a bit, they all just feel so unfortunately empty that although it might've been the same in the other Tales games I've played, this one hits the hardest. The cities especially feel so dead. Thankfully though I'm quite enjoying the cast interactions + characters themselves and Tales combat is still pretty good here.\n\nI've messed around with Stardew Valley for a while, putting in over 80 hours since my last post just as a break between the two above titles. I've been looking to pick up **SMT V: Vengeance** as I've always wanted to pick up the game, but didn't want to play it on the Switch so I'm glad this version is on PC. But hesistant because I've gone into the bad habit of buying -> starting -> then not finishing games because I take indefinite breaks playing other stuff",
            "I spent literally all week playing Persona 4 Golden!\u00a0\nI pulled a 14 hour marathon of that game everyday and finished it last night\u2026definitely my favorite game of all time now!\n\nI ended up replaying 7 hours of the game at one point because I started dating Yukiko only to immediately meet Rise after and change my mind\u2026\nGenuinely kind of felt emotional once it hit December because I didn\u2019t want the game to end\n\nExcited to start on Persona 5 next!",
            "SMT4! Just about done, just in time to start Vengeance. Having a blast but good lord nothing prepared me for >!Beelzebub!<",
            "Started Dragon Quest XI : Echoes of an Elusive Age about 2 weeks ago. At first I was like \"Okay, cutesy game with a predictable plot, but it's pretty fun so I'll just do the main quest and move onto the next game\". I almost switched to SMT V Vengeance which arrived in the mail last week. But I stuck with DQXI. Then Arachtagon came and nuked my party, which triggered my OCD to look up all recipe locations for the Fun-sized Forge. Last night, I returned the favour to the spider and killed him. Now it's off to Dundrasil!",
            "**SMT 5 Vengeance** Awesome so far, the new campaign and all the new mechanics and QoL are exactly what the game needed. Fantastic.\n\n**Rise of the Ronin** Not as bad as people said. Fun combat. If you keep to the story missions it flows a lot better. \n\n**Ys 8** Fun so far, looking forward to finally getting to use Dana though. good breezy side-game",
            "next week i gonna continue with\n\n\nFinal Fantasy 16 i got trough the tutorial\nthat game is just awesome and pretty easy for to play.",
            "Finished up FF7 Rebirth. Incredible game but a little bloated. The Cait Sith sections felt particularly drawn out. Didn\u2019t mind all the optional mini games though. \n\nDragon\u2019s Dogma 2 has been quite fun but after about 20 hours I\u2019m starting to feel the slog. Lack of enemy diversity, skills, and boring side quests have made for less enjoyable experience. \n\nGetting back into FF16 and man is that game fun. The characters are lovable, the combat is fluid, it looks great, and I enjoy the world it\u2019s set in. I forgot how shallow the equipment system is though. Most equipment is purely stat boosting and even though there are elemental themed weapons, they provide no boost to their titled elements. I hope a possible sequel fleshes these systems out. I also hope they figure out a middle ground between \u201cregular looking sword\u201d and \u201csword that looks like old pottery\u201d.",
            "I just beat zero and I loved it. Can't wait to jump into azure but elden ring dlc comes out tomorrow so I'll be busy for awhile. Started the series in January and my goal is to complete up to cold steel 2 for the year so I think I'm on a good pace.",
            "I'm putting Disgaea1 Complete on hold and currently playing Wizardry Gaiden 4 (SNES). \nIdk why but i just have this urge to play this game and couldn't put it down either. So far from what i've seen the game seems bigger than Wizardry 1/2/3 (The only ones i've beaten so far). It's still lacking in QoL features, like seeing equipment stats, but i like it's japanese/orientals theme. Oh it has minimap as well now. It's quite limited but really helpful to get my bearings as i explore.",
            "Trails from zero \n\nReally enjoying it\n\nI\u2019ve played sky arc (besides 3 as my computer died)\n\nCold steel 1-3 \n\nNice to fill in some of the blanks before I play cs 4 and reverie",
            "Unicorn Overlord: I finally conquered the furries! I don't know what it was, but the last few maps in this chapter were brutal for me. Them being super charged at night and all of the maps ended up being at night was really rough. But onward to the Angels! \n\n\n\nAlso started Nier: Automata and boy do I not have the brain for ARPGs. The controls are intuitive and all, but when I'm in combat I just can't do what I need to - especially parry. I went through all the healing items in the prologue when the auto heal was on and I've game overed at least 3 times in the first area. I'm playing on Normal too. There is a very low chance I end up beating this game lol",

It\u2019s notable for me imo that I\u2019m not just near constantly playing it. Like, I know it\u2019s a thing that people say about SMT that it\u2019s much less story than I\u2019d be used to - but I\u2019m kinda just betting that even then it goes places that will make it all worth it.\n\nIt\u2019s still early so I\u2019m willing to keep playing definitely.",

I picked the Vengeance route as wanted to experience the \"best\" version of the story. Really enjoying it so far.\n\nNot sure if you're playing on normal or hard but if it's normal, I'm kind of with you on the difficulty. I've played a lot of Persona so remember many weaknesses, but aside from a couple of boss wipes which a quick essence tuning resolved next try I'm not finding it particularly difficult.

            "Right.\n\nI don't mind a good boss rush. I don't mind a little grinding. I don't mind long stretches without save opportunities. I don't mind a tough superboss. I don't mind surprise difficulty curves. I object to *all of it all at once*. Yikes!",
            "That's a hard question. I think it's worth a shot if the setting really appeals to you, otherwise it's just kind of mid.\n\nAnd I had never heard of Solatorobo, thanks for the suggestion.",
            "Yeah after finishing P3R earlier this year and P5R a couple years back, I think I'm more interested in the gameplay rather than the social aspects. I played the digital devil saga games a couple years ago and those were my favorites. This game seems very pleasant and enjoyable so far.",
            "PC. I play on my Steam Deck during the week while commuting and then play on my desktop PC at home on the weekend. Steam Cloud is pretty nice for that.",
            "Yeah i've played an hour on the Deck too, it's quite nice.",
            "I'm playing on Hard and haven't had much resistance beyond what I expected. \n\n Matador is still a motherfucker if you go in without Null Force, but Kikuri-Hime hard-counters him and fuses at the level you're meant to fight.   Naamah's AOE charm spam is interesting for how early she appears, but Apsaras + Leanan Sidhe shut her down and both are introduced in quests beforehand.",
            "I think the difficulty could be more from the new gameplay system in CO-OP attacks. Also you can't make the demons you want since matching with alignment is usually best. You kinda need to learn the rules again in a way.",
            "Combat wise it isn\u2019t that bad, but I definitely find the dungeons way harder to navigate than other often SMT games",
            "Oh, maybe I was confusing the number. Penacony is the dream world right ? It is that I consider to be bad. The last several hours or so it only introduced annoying mini game after annoying mini game without trying to introduce any hint of something interesting. If you tell me it become good I may reconsider dropping but the beginning is very weak.",
            "It\u2019s not a masterpiece or anything but I think the pacing is a lot better and it does a better job of staying more grounded with its smaller scope\n\nOnce the organization got involved in chain of memories and everybody was wearing hoods and speaking in riddles all of the time I really think that was the beginning of the end for any chance the overall story had\n\nKH1 was also the only one in the series that integrated the Disney villains into the main plot which made it a lot more unique than later entries where Disney Worlds are largely background noise before the organization member shows up to marginally advance the actual plot",
            "Ohhh yeah its that one, yeah the start is weak, its meant to show you the world and its mostly exploration, a big percent of the players do agree that the ending of Penacony is the best part of the game so far."

For example, a game with mechanics like pokemon which would allow the player to make a level 1 speed run like BotW?\n\nI'm theory-crafting a monster-taming game, and turn-based team combat seems like the best fit thematically, but I'd like the system to reward skill-based play, which doesn't seem possible to me.  To use a pokemon analogy, it doesn't matter how good you are, a level 5 starter can't solo the elite 4 and champion.  Are there any games that have solved this?",

            "This might depend on how you define 'skill'. There are definitely turn-based games where it's possible to do low level runs. Final Fantasy VIII comes to mind, in which staying at a low level is actually optimal due to how level scaling works, but [this page](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowLevelRun) has lots of other examples.

Yakuza: Like A Dragon is a fresh start for the series with a new main character and the first JRPG in the series , that's the reason why you should play it before (the excellent) Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth. It's not necessary to play the older games, you will understand why a specific character is so important for the series in Infinite Wealth. Yes, the emotional impact of one part of the story may be deeper when you know the older games, but it's not necessary. They did a great job explaining why that one specific character is so special. But all in all it's about the new main character Ichiban. Those games are so good, there's a high possibility that you will maybe play the older games too after that, but they are not JRPGs.\u00a0"

I admit I almost got a little emotional thinking about the promise of it lol, plus the fact that *two* Saga games would be released this year. \n\nI mean, the remake of RS1 translated one of the lesser entries in the series into one of the best (IMHO).

And so on.\n\nThis game has a very deep system tho. It\u2019s not just leveling up and fight. You need to fight strategically or you can lose all your party members. And this game has an enemy level system too which if you fight too much the enemies would get stronger too. Which made it even more difficult and complicated to play. \nIt was like a Turn based Souls like(you die many times to get the perfect strategy to win)",

            "It's not plot heavy at all. You basically have the find the plot yourself as you wander around the world, so since the story is so non-linear it doesn't unfold in an epic way.\u00a0\n\n\nBut since this is a full remake, who knows, they may expand the story.",
            "I wouldn\u2019t recommend SaGa games for plot tho.\nBut like the other comment said, probably they will expand the story.\nSince in Japan there was a Stage Theatre explaining about the Sevens(enemies from this game) which wasn\u2019t explained in the original games and why they became evil.",
            "Not plot heavy.\n\nIt's closer to something like Baldur's Gate (1998) if you've ever played that.\n\nThere's an initial setup for your quest, and then your big baddies to defeat, but everything in between is largely adventuring around the world and stumbling upon little scenarios and side quests.\n\nAlso your party members are essentially fodder. They're blank slates so you can project whatever you want onto them, if you like.\n\nIt's one of those games where you actually have space to role play and create your own stories.",
            "Like the others said, you won't get that tightly-written linear narrative in SaGa really. There's a lot more emphasis on making your own story based on the events you interact with and how you choose to resolve them.",
            "Yup I got softlocked and never went back will finish it this time though",
            "Honestly it would likely inspired open world games earlier in the west if more had played it. For world design it's an important as Wizardy is to RPG gameplay design",
            "So mainly novelty of unique systems & mechanics in the genre like Ogre Battle and LIve a Live. Young self definitely would have appreciated it back then for sure. My first exposure to SaGa was FFL and SaGa Frontier though I didn't know it at that time.",
            "So it's like an inspiration from Falcom's Sorcerian then? That game lets you freely create characters in different classes and choose any scenario that you want to do first but each time you start one, the character ages, depending on that character's class/race.",
            "To be honest, I've seen people mock the RS2 remake for \"looking like a mobile game\" already. You can't hide it no matter how much you try. \n\nIt's just a matter of money and resources after a certain point.",

            "I'd say it's more story heavy than plot heavy.",
            "Yeah. RS2's open world with multiple ways to solve quests which leads to different consequences felt a bit like Fallout 1, but that game released years after RS2.\n\nAfaik, the prominent open world rpg in the west in the early 90s was the Might and Magic series. But I don't remember it having that many choice & consequences. It's more of a big map to explore and dungeons to clear type of rpg.\n\nEdit: I just remembered I haven't played the Ultima series yet. Nowadays, Ultima 7 is still considered one of the best wrpgs, and it released a year before Romancing SaGa 2. Need to play it someday to see how it compares to other rpgs from those times.",
            "Hmm interesting. Probably kawazu was inspired\n by it with little twists.\nNice find I didn\u2019t know about that game.\n(Since I\u2019m too young lol)",
            "Going conventional after a \u201cdaring game\u201d is classic Kawazu, and has nothing to EB\u2019s performance. He\u2019s been doing that for decades. Kawazu just does what he wants, except that the budget is now handled by Ichikawa.",
            "I went in expecting an upgrade from SaGa Scarlet Grace only to get a watered down SSG. It took a step forward but two steps backward in some aspects. Combat was repetitive and ho-hum easy for majority of time and considerably more RNG compared to SSG. I'm glad Kawazu is moving forward with RS2 remake, though it look to be more of what I loved about SaGa.",
            "Most SaGa games get mixed reviews on Steam regardless, because the systems are so opaque compared to the typical JRPG. A lot of people try it and just simply can't get past the non-traditional leveling honestly.",
            "That's just a small part, and the ports are good from what I have experienced. The mechanics of the SaGa series are in general are aimed at a specific type of audience, which is a niche demographic even within the JRPG community.\n\nFans of the series and others who like the type of experience that the SaGa series offers will certainly enjoy the game (me included), but if we overhype the game then instead of drawing new fans, it will have the opposite effect.",

        "content": "So with the new Dragon Quest III trailer I definitely think that HD-2D is the best style for a franchise like Pok\u00e9mon. I know HD-2D is from Square Enix explaining why other games from other companies can't use this style, but maybe they can reach an agreement\nIt's been years since Pok\u00e9mon started using the 3D models since X & Y and probably a lot of people prefer it. But I think it would be better for the franchise to use this art style:\n\u2022 For remakes like a Black/White will be much better than what they did with Diamond & Pearl. \n\u2022 3D is good too yes, but it is clear that Game Freak    do not exploit their full potential (just see Scarlet & Violet). Of course is not a financial problem (being the most profitable franchise) just a \"people will buy it anyways\".\n\u2022 Having the old games a cross movement for the characters and being turn-based is perfect for this style.\n\u2022 If they don't have to dedicate that much hours into modeling an entire 3D open world, etc they could invest their time in improving the story, characters,...\n\nSeeing for example what the Zelda team is capable of doing to the franchise in a limited console like the Switch puts the Pok\u00e9mon dedicated team in a much worse place and it's frustrating to see the wasted potential. Sorry if my english is not that good, it's not my mother tongue but I hope it was clear enough.",

            "Just to be clear, what Square Enix owns is the \"HD-2D\" marketing term. They cannot prohibit others from making a game with the same look, just from promoting it with that term.\n\nThat being said, I absolutely would love if pokemon went that route at least for the 5th gen inevitable remakes. It would make sense considering Black and White and their sequels were already doing something similar graphic-wise. Sadly, most of the casual audicence thinks that 2d is inherently obsolete compared to 3d, so I just do not see Game Freak taking the risk with something that is not a spin-off with different gameplay.\n\nI do love seeing the fans' depiction of what it could look like though:\n\n[https://youtu.be/fMJcgiyFOps?si=LA4Z6H8etbkzVVC1](https://youtu.be/fMJcgiyFOps?si=LA4Z6H8etbkzVVC1)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ijj-pAitQfg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ijj-pAitQfg)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrCWe9Jm5jg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrCWe9Jm5jg)",

They are content with shipping buggy and unpolished games of a quality that, if we're being entirely honest, is shameful for a flagship franchise.\n\nI say that to say: Yes it would be better for Pok\u00e9mon to adopt a high quality pixel style rather than continuing on with a visual style that does their games' worlds and monsters dirty by making them look lifeless and empty. But considering how happy they are to stay their course, it makes no sense to even dwell on the idea imo.",

Turning 700+ pokemon from 3D into classical 2D GB-esque sprites is a huge call. One could utilize DS sprites, but they obviously will need polishing for a good quality transition if the goal is to have smoother sprite animations like Dragon Quest 3 2DHD.\n\nPersonally, I'd rather they bring a new game from the Colosseum/Shadow Pokemon series but make it more difficult. Double battles are just way too underrated as a concept in my opinion (that, and I just want Miror B back).",

Instead of constantly changing, the formula for the sake of change brings back the best aspects from each gen and make a killer game. B&W stylr story. Mega evolutions.

There's no reason the games should look so wonky. They simply can get away with doing things the way they do because people still buy their games.\n\nBut that's not to say I wouldn't like and HD-2D game. Having loved Black/White and recently gone through the DS Dragon Quest games, I'm all for that blend of 2D and 3D. There's something very charming about it.",
            "A lot of games with classic play styles would work great in 2D HD and we could essentially list new releases or remakes for almost all long-running franchises. Think about it.

ULTRAKILL :D\n\nThat said, 2D HD is just one of many styles and I would prefer companies to not only choose one of four styles while making games (realistic, anime, 2D HD and mobile game budget). Indie games are much better at this, mostly because so they stand a chance against ultrarealistic AAA games.",

The sprites are so much more expressive and capture the mons so much better than an almost T-posing character model.

Those are just poorly made 3d and \"beat em up\" style games respectively.\n\nWhat OP is referring to is the art style you get from the octopath series, which are what patented the HD-2D moniker anyway. That type of art style would work pretty well for pokemon I think.\n\nAnd again, I think you're confusing your distaste towards the quality and colour palette with art style. The style in those 2 games isn't massively different from what we got in Pokemon sun and moon, it just looks really bad in comparison. Like Mario and Luigi dream team looks like an n64 level game on the 3ds. But sun and moon was fine.",

            "Yeah, if only Black and White (my favourite in the franchise) looks like I said or even something like the pixel remaster as someone suggested I would be happy enough. I understand that being 3D the direction that they took it would be risky for a mainline game to use it, but for the 5 first gens and others like mystery dungeon it could be a great move for having them in Switch or the next console and not being trapped in Nintendo DS",

I prefer that than the shitty 3D, bugged and running at 10 FPS",
            "All of which is why the first word in my comment was \u201cDisagree\u201d. As in I disagree that Pok\u00e9mon needs HD-2D style. And I meant that I love the style seen in those Mario and Luigi games and think that their aesthetic could really fit a new Pok\u00e9mon game",

My order was Emerald, Fire Red, Diamond, Platinum, SoulSilver, White, Black 2, X, Omega Ruby, Sun, and then Shield. So I can't speak on OG gens 1 & 2. I'm sure there were probably glitches and exploits in the earlier games I listed as well but they're probably not something like common cosmetic issues, which is the type of thing that very quickly makes a game feel low quality.\n\nThe main thing, I think, is that it's easier to mask imperfections and limitations in a pixel art style, top-down handheld game that's on a small screen. Modern 3D games come with a level of expectations and standards from a lot of players (maybe not *most* due to the high sales of recent games), especially for series of this kind of status, and Pok\u00e9mon just isn't hitting the mark.",
            "They have been releasing the games with style too much. They are over saturating the market. And not every game needs the hd 2d style. Idk why you all want it so badly. It was cool now it's boring. They need to give the style a break for 2 years then come back to it.",

Like keep it to all squares jrpgs but let every other developer use s different style. BC why do you want the market to be over saturated. It's not good and it's not needed. Just let square do hd 2d and keep them away from Pok\u00e9mon remakes. And other developers need to stop using that style too. Like why do s lot of other developers have to use that style too"

I suppose a guide could help you find your way through dungeons, give advice on demon setups and tell you the weaknesses and strengths of bosses without having to do your own \"trial run\" first.\n\nI remember playing the game when it came out on PS2, didn't use a guide (probably didn't even have internet at the time) and the game actually made me quit it twice - but, more interestingly, it made me come back to it both times. That never happens. Normally, when I take a break from a JRPG, it's over, but there was something about the game that wouldn't let me go.",

            "The last game I used a youtube guide for is Kingdom Hearts 3 , the game isn\u2019t difficult by any means, but at the later parts of the game some points felt like a walking around in circles simulator and instead of walking in circles for hours tryna find that little thing I need to get to I just used a guide, Usually that\u2019s where I hit rock bottom with games and get tired of it, I love difficult combat and gameplay like Elden Ring for example, My mind just can\u2019t always figure out where tf I need to go whenever games choose to make it tedious",
            "Sadly this is most likely the top answer. All the names I see mentioned here are because of the challenging start, even ones like Resonance of Fate just need you to spend an hour going through the long tutorial. But Unlimited SaGa is on another level, even with a guide you'll find it challenging to play.",
            "Yeah, this is it.   Knights in the Nightmare might be close, but US explains even less of how to properly play it, while KitN at least has in-game tutorials.\n\nResonance of Fate seems complicated in the beginning but it ultimately isn't too hard once you do all the tutorials and get to experimenting.  \n\nUnlimited SaGa will not hold your hand at all, there are no tutorials, and (unless you're Japanese) the instruction manual gives you literally zero info on what to do.",
            "I literally came here to say this.  To this day I have no idea what the hell was going on.  I\u2019ve never given up on any game after a couple of hours with the exception of Unlimited Saga.",
            "I read the manual before playing and still couldn't figure out how to open treasure chests without googling.",
            "Details please. Seems interesting. Is it ungodly hard or complicated? Or is it just so obstuse?",
            "Im pretty sure i had to start that one over after screwing myself with the gear combining system in that game.\n\nMy second playthrough was much smoother because I paid attention as I was combining stuff.",
            "Fr, if you don't know what you are doing you will be confused why you only deal chip damage",

            "It\u2019s kinda sad because with a guide, I had a blast with this one a couple years ago. Without the help though, I can see this game being just too brutal and frustrating. \n\nThe solutions to the puzzles are pretty wacky. Even after 30 years of playing RPGs I was like \u201chow TF are you supposed to get THAT solution from THOSE clues!?!\u201d Even changing the princess, I couldn\u2019t physically figure out how to apply the item to fix her. I had the item but using it in front of her didn\u2019t do anything. I think that\u2019s the point I went heavy on looking up solutions.",
            "Was looking for this! Started it two days ago and unless you actively go to the training thing in the colosseum, not a single explanation is ever given about combat lol",
            "Wasn't that because of an bug in the experience/level system in the international version?",
            "FFT is hard as balls, you basically just have to grind at some parts. You will constantly find yourself facing down squads of enemies more powerful you that outnumber you if you don't. What chapter was it, Dorter Trade City I think is the legendary one early on?",
            "Or I definitely agree, I\u2019ve tried playing that game a dozen times, always give up.",
            "Probably not stupid no, FFTactics is a game a lot of people tend to just grind early on and roll because the early classes are boring so a lot of people just throw rocks at themselves to gain JP.\n\nIts a very exploitable game in practice because of rough balancing, but you need to pass some knowledge checks of where things are to find all the exploitable options in a timely fashion. There's also a few trap fights that can soft lock you if you aren't ready, if you get asked to save randomly save in a new slot or you might softlock, but those fights aren't like impossible or anything they just can create unsalvageable scenarios if you're not ready.\n\nEventually you just get an overpowered man who wins the game for you near the end, which doesn't help its difficulty.",
            "Not the remaster. They fixed the grind.",
            "You're not stupid.\n\nThe game is just incredibly grindy.",
            "There are two main choke points, one at the start of the game with Dorter and then there's one later where Ramza fights this jagoff with a bunch of demons. For whatever reason Ramza is like \"I'll go alone\". \n\nThe first one is a choke point cause you don't have a lot of time to get your bearings straight but the second one can save-trap you.",
            "Nocturne got nothing on Strange Journey's bullfuckery dungeon designs.",
            "I have not played all the MegaTen games but I have played a lot of them, and so far for me Soul Hackers 1 takes the cake in terms of difficulty.\n\nEnemies do lots of damage just like in Nocturne, but the MC never becomes strong since it's one of those old SMT games where the MC just doesn't have powers. Also, turns aren't split into enemy and player phase. Things just go in order based on agility plus position plus randomness. This makes it very hard to establish buffs/debuffs as your buffing demons will often get sniped before their turn comes up. \n\nSkill inheritance also sucks in Soul Hackers so it's virtually impossible to have good skills on all your demons. Like, the best team I was able to build for postgame had rakukaja, makakaja, tetrakarn and makarakarn, and that was it for utility.\n\nI played Nocturne on hard and had a blast. I will NEVER play Soul Hackers 1 on hard. Fuck that.",
            "Nocturne? I found it fairly simple to go through. Only problem i had was the final puzzle in the last dungeon - could have figured it out but couldn\u2019t be asked to waste time anymore",
            "Haven\u2019t thought of this game in a loooong time \ud83d\ude05",
            "I have tried to replay that game like 50 times and get trashed. I have no idea how I beat it on PSP when I was younger. \ud83d\ude2d",
            "Emulator for speed up and save states. Makes many older JRPGs less frustrating",
            "Souls games are quite easy, other rpgs can be a nightmare\u00a0",
            "Eh I think only the combat you might need some hand holding on, and most of it isn't like impossible to understand if you play with it and try to feel your way through it a few times through trial and error for a couple of hours maybe. I figured out most of what was going on okay enough by just feeling my way around and observing things and XB2's encounter design isn't so difficult that you need to master everything. The only thing I really needed any outside materials for were remembering the elemental combo charts and that was just a visual aid.\n\nThe other two you can brute force or stumble enough if you try (field checks just will take a lot of fiddling to solve IME). I found the second Zeke fight fine by just stealthing my way through and running fast once I realized there's no other way to go but forward that way as the cursor tells me I'm getting closer. Maybe its because I'm used to FF11 where you had to do that shit a lot more and the mobs were far less kind with their hit detection, and I knew XB1 and X liked to have overleveled garbage get in your way sometimes. So 2 was just \"ah okay, I get it\" I mean you have a gigantic level 70 something ape just strolling around in the first map when you're level like 8. You just know you're in for some weird enemy stuff once Rotbart donkey punches you in the ass from nowhere enough times.\n\nThere's worse games then XB2 to me to play completely blind, like Last Remnant or probably SaGa games in-general for most people you aren't initiated at all. Or Yggdra Union GBA (PSP is a little more generous) because of all the random tiles of important items you need to reasonably win or actually knowing what the fuck the MVP turn limit is so you can get that important snowball rolling, or going for Knights in the Nightmare's true ending if you care about that because of how absolutely nonsensically esoteric it is.",
            "I played Resonance of Fate a while ago and some of its tutorials are pretty bad. Sometimes they say something unhelpful like 'do a tri attack' without telling you a button.\n\n\nI had to go to reddit to work out some of it mid tutorial.",
            "Something as simple as opening a treasure chest can take up to 5 steps using various character skills. Mess up and the chest explodes, damaging the party and destroying what\u2019s inside. Even with skills used, you still have to spin slots.\n\nAlmost all chests are like this.\n\nBut worse, you are never told any of this. So, a new player will open chests with no skills, and spin slots with a huge number of bomb icons. Every other chest will explode and the game will feel totally luck-based and unfair.\n\nNow imagine that every single mechanic is like this. Different attacks have no descriptions. HP isn\u2019t HP. Healing is done via an obscure button (L3), that was rarely used back in PS2 days. Combos keep getting interrupted. Fighting battles seemingly earns you nothing (not true).\n\nBecause of the LP system, nothing you do seems to matter. You somehow get through half the game by randomly choosing attacks that look cool. Then eventually, you reach a brick wall and you keep getting party-wiped. All while having no idea what\u2019s going on.\n\nThat\u2019s Unlimited SaGa in a nutshell. Very fun with a guide. Impossible to play without.",

            "The only reason I beat the boss was I could infinite the cross bow for like 5 damage a hit.",
            "Wouldn't even say that's the hard part. You can fuck yourself by not leveling the characters equally because some chapters only allow you to control 1 or 2 characters. Then you can also lose a bunch of progress because your last save was something like 30 minutes ago and you ended up in a fight that's really hard.",
            "People skipped the training colosseum?\u00a0",
            "Not a bug, it was intentionally made harder, they just swung *way* too hard in that direction.",
            "Yes, I think its\u00a0Dorter. There were 2 mages that kept nuking me lol. I had to try it over 10 times.",
            "It\u2019s tough in general but it\u2019s compounded by the fact that you have uncontrollable characters that go rogue and make the worst moves. So you have to figure how to save them on the fly or lost the fight. \n\nPlus that one notorious boss fight that you have to solo. And if you don\u2019t have the right build, you\u2019d have to restart the whole game.",

It's just a shame that you don't have >!Morag!<in the party yet because the path behind that door is actually much easier. I couldn't break the door the first time and had to go around the giant spiders as well.",
            "Yeah, it's a little bit hard to get the hang of, but US is on another level.  Not only is battle difficult to figure out, but so is character progression, navigating the world, and triggering necessary quests for endgame!",

            "Oh, I'm sure. I'm excited for an eventual remaster. Hopefully they make things a bit comprehensible .",
            "They could literally keep the game as-is and include in-game tooltips like SaGa Emerald Beyond, and I'd be happy.   Just tell me how to do the thing!"
