I know that I have to draw, I have a good basis (anatomy and can draw in different styles), and I practice. But I don't know where to start to get a \"book\". Should I draw flash tattoo sketches? Should I explore how to place a tattoo? Should I learn how to draw in American Traditional, Neo Traditional, New School, Black and Grey, Realism, Japanese, Tribal, Script / Lettering, Watercolor, and Geometric tattoo styles? I have no idea.",

I'm totally new to this so dunno if this sounds stupid but I'm looking almost for a sharpie version of it on my body so I can spend a day (or hour) looking at it and seeing if it looks how I want.\n\nAnyone have any leads on how I can do this?

            "people with NECK/UPPER CHEST TATTOOS, did you find yourself having to change your jewelry/clothing styles at all to not have it clash with the tattoo? I have smaller tattoos (mostly 2\u201d-4\u201d) on my arms, legs, and back as well as little stuff on my hands but I\u2019ve been wanting to get a tattoo on my upper chest/back around my neck, loosely based on an actual large collar-shaped necklace I have. I\u2019ve been experimenting with wearing it under different clothing than I would normally pair it with to see if I still like having that shape with different necklines and I\u2019ve found that I do still love how it looks under a slightly open button up shirt or a t shirt which are honestly the most common necklines I wear. the design would be all black with mostly finer lines (nothing thicker than a millimeter) but would extend several inches down my chest from the base of my neck and taper symmetrical up and around the back of my neck. I only have black tattoos rn because I like to wear a lot of bright colors and I don\u2019t want to worry about the tattoo colors clashing with my outfits or jewelry, and I\u2019m hoping that will still be true for this chest piece. but I am wondering if getting it will make me stop wearing necklaces I love since they would be laying on top of this intricate black design. does anyone who has tattoos in this area have thoughts on this? once it healed/you got used to it did you feel like it \u201cfaded\u201d from prominence when you look at it enough to be able to wear big necklaces on top of it, or does the shape of a big necklace look bad to you on top of the tattoo?",

            "i mean you can ask them to draw it up and put a stencil on you, that\u2019s probably as close as it will get, the stencil won\u2019t show and shading or color if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for",
            "90% of my tattoos are on my legs and I\u2019ve personally got them at all times of the year. At the end of the day it\u2019s really just going to come down to your personal preference. You\u2019ll want to avoid excessive sun exposure and swimming for at least 4-6 weeks until you can put sunscreen on it, so if you have a lot of outdoor plans this summer and want to wear shorts, then it\u2019d probably be better to wait until autumn.",
            "There's definitely something to be said for being able to be comfortable in shorts or a skirt while it's healing (and to not be freezing!), however you have the sun factor to deal with. It will definitely hurt in the sun (like a bad sunburn) for the first two weeks or so, and you shouldn't really put sunscreen on for the first few weeks. \n\nI've gotten most of my legs/torso done in the winter or early spring. While the clothing can irritate it, for sure, I don't really have to worry about any other factors (sun, swimming). But I try to wear dresses/roomy pants and never jeans or tight pants while it's healing, for at least 2 weeks because it can be painful.\n\nI think it comes down to preference. Imo neither is necessarily \"better\", but whichever fits your lifestyle best.",
            "Depends on how well you know yourself and your pain tolerance. I super can't handle things like stubbing my toe or getting a papercut, so I knew from that start that joints are a no-go for me. If you think you can endure the pain, go for it!",

            "I only have two tattoos (planning on many more) so take this with a grain of salt, but that reponse from your friend seems kinda fair. For me, I just know I want tattoos, so getting the first one that had meaning just kinda broke the seal and now I\u2019m already much less selective because I just want more. I\u2019d say try to decide on something, then just wait. If you still like it after months have passed, you\u2019re on the right track. I\u2019ve had ideas come and go and I\u2019m thankful I didn\u2019t book them when I thought of it.\n\nForearm wasn\u2019t bad for me, I just got my second on the underside of my forearm",
            "got my inner forearm done recently (first tattoo) and the pain is super manageable. it was like a 4-5 hour session and the last hour was kinda tough cuz the skin at that point is super tender so every wipe feels kinda abrasive, but even then, it's not thaaat bad. the first couple hours are a piece of cake (like a 2-3/10 pain scale). the most it got up to was like a 4 or 5. i think it's more of the length of time that you feel pain rather than the severity of the pain. you'll be fine",

The motive I want is a slightly modified version of this illustration\n\n[https://victorianweb.org/art/illustration/sullivan/69.jpg](https://victorianweb.org/art/illustration/sullivan/69.jpg)\n\nFor the placement I wanted my upper left arm and center the image right smack in the middle there. But I think that it is to big for my arm (circumference \\~ 32cm / 12.6 inches). The modifications to the image are mostly small things around the hourglass and the snakes body vertically elongating the whole image slightly.\n\nHas anyone done something similar in terms of size and placement?\n\nAnd the second question, how do you prepare individual images for a halve/full sleeve. If were to get the image above on my arm, how do I plan for the next bigger images or backdrops? Is that just an artist thing or are there good resources to look at?",
            "So I'm getting [this](https://imgur.com/a/M0CXJgH) on my shoulder later today, and I don't know how long it'll take. How long does it usually take for words to be tattooed? This is literally my first tattoo and everyone keeps asking me how long it'll take for me to get it done, but I don't know. (The \"2)\" isn't going to be part of the tattoo, just the words in black)",

A friend wanted to do an armband, which by itself is no big deal (the design to do is simple enough), but for the life of me, I can't get the stencil to line up perfectly... How do you, more experienced people do?\n If it helps, the width of the design is 8cm, top forearm measure is 27 and bottom is 22. \nThe design is just triangles, one up, one down and so on.\nThanks in advance for any help!!",

For those who have done this how bad is it?",

            "Feel kinda dumb for having to ask this considering I already have 5 tattoos...\n\nWhat's the best way to find an artist for the specific thing you want tattooed, if you aren't doing what I did for 4 out of my 5 tattoos and showing up for your appointment with a picture of the exact thing you want inked that you found online or had a friend write?\n\nContext: I want a horse tattoo to commemorate my \"heart horse\" who passed several years ago...like I want it to look like him, not a more generic tribute to him. I've spent like 5 years periodically searching the internet to find what I want, and 99% of what I've seen I find either super tacky, or is nice but not what I'm looking for. Looking up different tattoo artists in my city on their IG I have yet to find anyone who's done a horse tattoo, let alone one I like the style of. Most animal tattoos done are cats, dogs, wild animals like lions, etc.\n\nI'm nervous of doing something to piss off a tattoo artist (think pet peeves) without realizing it's a faux-pas. Like is it a faux-pas to message an artist asking if they know of any artist in the city who'd be good to do a horse tattoo? or is that in poor form? What happens if I think I've found someone, they sketch something out for me and I realize it's really not what I'm looking for, wrong style, etc....is it bad to tell them that and back out, or is that wasting time? \n\n  \nMaybe I'm thinking too far into this? haha",

            "Does anyone have advice for orientation of inner bicep tattoos? This is a bare area of my left arm that I'd like to explore getting tattooed, but I'm not sure about placement for this area. Should I be aiming to have something that's right-side-up when holding my arm up, as if to flex? For example, a sick-ass panther or other long animal? Or should it be more like other arm tattoos that are right-side-up when my arm is at rest, even though it won't really be visible without me lifting my arm? I know it's ultimately up to me and my artist, but I wanted to get the thoughts of some other tattooers/tattooees as well. Have a great day!",

            "Hello! I'm getting my fourth tattoo in July and am still struggling with deciding placement. It's meant to be a medium sized Medusa tattoo, and originally I was thinking back tricep but my trainer told me that as I lose or gain weight or muscle, the tattoo will likely warp and suggested forearm or lower back instead. I'm not too keen on either of those suggestions.\n\nAll my tattoos so far are easily hidden because I work a corporate job in Singapore and while the culture is getting more liberal, it can sometimes still be quite frowned upon in a corporate setting. I have one on the back of my neck, a small one on my bicep and a large one on my ribs.\n\nAny ideas would be helpful!

I love the head, wings, and torso, but am looking to get the bottom part covered up. However, I am not sure what to get it covered with so as not to ruin the look of the piece. I live in Pittsburgh and would be getting it done by @markalbertattoo on instagram for style reference, and would like to get the gothic ecclesiastical style incorporated somehow.

Out of all the studios that I researched, I really liked them the best. No regrets, my tattoo healed amazingly!",

My advice is to look for an artist you love their portfolio.",
