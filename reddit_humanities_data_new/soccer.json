            "We've stolen another player off Kings Lynn, prompting a further twitter meltdown from their chairman. \n\nStarting to have slight concerns about the profile of our squad, our transfer strategy has pretty much entirely been taking a punt on players who've played well in lower leagues and/or played for our gaffer at Kings Lynn. I can see what the thinking is, especially given the success we had with Stokes, but my worry would be if you sign all your players from leagues below then you end up with a squad that's lower league quality across the board if none of them step up.\n\nRowe, Harries and O'Keefe have all left and while none of them were particularly good they made up like 90% of the experience in our squad between them so we could do with getting someone with some nous in. Given the money we made on Stokes and the cup last year we should have the cash to bring in one older player on a higher wage but our board have been notoriously stingy recently.\n\nCurrently also waiting on whether Glover and Tetek sign new deals. Both would be big losses if they don't because Glover was at times our best player last season and Tetek for the handful of games he was fit for was by far our best midfielder.",
            "Could anyone from Norway tell me what's wrong with Aalesund?\n\nThey've been doing just fine in the top tier for as long as I can remember... After the relegation they are doing terrible in second tier now as well. I see they just fired the manager. Their squad doesn't look that bad either for this level. Is it just an unlucky start and managerial issues? Or do they have financial problems?",

            "really an exaggeration. The Netherlands could've won with the offside goal, France could've won with Griezmann's chances - and they're missing Mbapp\u00e9, and they've only scored 1 (OG) in two games anyways. I've seen worse games too.",
            "You will always have these type of games with a group stage. If it was the last game and they were tied then they would probably go for it but as the 2nd game both tied with 3pts and Austria winning, not losing is more important than winning for both teams.",
            "16 shots, two gigantic occasions that should have never been missed...\n\nDo not mistake our abysmal finishing for a lack of drive to win the game. We absolutely played for the 3 pts but didn't rise up to the occasion.",

Oh and dont bother asking to play in the position you do at your club\u2026\n\nRice, your biggest weakness is hitting line breakers in buildup, so we are just going to have 3 attacking players on the left all crowd each other out with no runners in behind to atleast stretch the pitch so its even harder for you to hit line breakers.

Of course, he could have done close to nothing about how this Euros campaign has gone for Poland as he wasn\u2019t fit, but taking other tournaments into consideration, it feels like he has very few moments of lifting his country.

With that said, England have neither of these things at the moment, and when you take them out you're left with a full-back/midfielder in Trent who is probably not as well-rounded as many of his peers. \n\nIt's why I'd always defended Southgate for not picking him in the past, and why I'm so annoyed that he's decided to do it now even though the current side is probably even less suited to Trent's skillset than the prior England teams.",

He would speak English and just be very assertive. He learned some basic spanish because of how many Spanish-speaking players there are, but he said that it could be a bit difficult to communicate in Spanish during the heat of a match. He gave Messi as an example. He refereed an Argentina match when he was still learning basic Spanish. He could communicate one-way pretty easily with \"NO M\u00c1S!\" and \"La pr\u00f3xima vez, amarillo!\"\n\nHowever when Messi came up to him to ask him something, it was hopeless. He just couldn't keep up. After several \"Qu\u00e9?\" and \"Repetirlo?\" he just said \"Si si\" and waved him along which Messi just accepted lol.\n\nThe other example was with Akinfeev. Akinfeev speaks absolutely no English. Only Russian. So when he was wasting time Jonas ran up to him and shouted at him to stop doing that in English as assertively as he could.

            "Agree that it's almost certainly going in regardless, but don't agree that it's not obstruction because he didn't dive. A keeper can be subconsciously affected by someone standing next to them in a position that blocks a dive, it's natural for a person to consciously/subconsciously not want to dive straight into another person. And we do actually see Maignan make a small motion that looks like he was going to dive, but then stops (maybe because the player is there, or maybe because he has no hope of saving it, we can't really know). That's why it's viewed as interferring with the keeper/obstruction.\n\nOf course he's not saving it even if he does dive for it, so really sympathise with Netherlands. But from my neutral perspective it's technically it's consistent with how refs apply the rules in general. They view the foul seperate to the \"what was going to happen if there was no foul\" consideration. As an analogy to explain this, we do have a common scenario where two players are going for the ball and one gets to it before the other but draws a foul as a result, but their touch is super heavy and they're 100% losing possession with or without any foul. The foul is still given regardless of whether they would've retained possession or not. Like, this happens often when a keeper rushes out and the attacker knocks the ball past them but with such a heavy touch that the ball is 100% going out for a goal kick and if there's no contact the attacker is never getting it (in fact some players look for the penalty rather than trying to score, they know they can't get to the ball first and also control it perfectly whilst maintaining balance to score, so they get any touch they can to get the ball past the keeper first and then ensure there's contact). Refs always give the foul/penalty because the keeper has missed the ball and made contact with the attacker, they ignore the fact that the attacker lost all control of the ball and wouldn't score if the keeper avoided contact. They seperate the foul from the rest of the scenario and focus solely on the fact that a foul of some sort occurred. And I think this is what happened here, it didn't matter if the shot was unsaveable or not, they were only focusing on was the offside player interferring with the keeper in any way, and I think that's a definite yes (he's standing where the keeper would dive). Very harsh and unfair, but consistent.",
            "Goalkeeping is so instinctive - you're not going to see them make an attempt to save the ball if in the split second they have to react they're being impeded.\n\nTo me it's impossible to argue that having a forward standing next to the goalkeeper didn't impede their ability to *attempt* to make a save",

            "No, the decision was 100% correct. Even if it's indeed very unlikely the shot would be saved, it's not up to the referee to make this kind of call that \"he's not saving that anyway\". That just opens up a new huge can of worms. What if there was an offside player but the shot was top bins anyway? Should that also be allowed because \"he ain't saving that\"? What if Xavi's finish was more to the middle of the goal, would that suddenly be offside because the shot is saveable?\n\nOffside is purely about positions and not about the quality of the finish.",
            "The player was standing inside the line of the ball literally next to the keeper. It's the epitome of interfering, even if it was still almost certain to be a goal. It's not complicated and these decisions are good for football, even if they seem a bit tough on the attacking team. If he was outside the line of the ball then it should have stood. \n\nDon't forget that VAR confirmed it, although no fucking clue why it took so long.",

Whether he would have saved it or not is irrelevant.",
            "If a player covers the view of the keeper to the ball, it can also end up in the net before the keeper sees it.\n\nI can see the decision going either way (depending on the ref's interpretation of that situation). There's also the possibility that the keeper might have been be positioned a bit differently if the player hadn't made the run that landed him in an offside position.\n\nThere's all kinds of little influences. To me it's one of those decisions that you don't like getting for your team but don't mind as much if the other team gets the goal taken away.\n\nI think this is the subsection of the rule that would apply:\n\nhttps://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/lawsandrules/laws/football-11-11/law-11---offside\n\n> a player moving from, or standing in, an offside position is in the way of an opponent and interferes with the movement of the opponent towards the ball this is an offside offence if it impacts on the ability of the opponent to play or challenge for the ball; if the player moves into the way of an opponent and impedes the opponent's progress (e.g blocks the opponent) the offence should be penalised under Law 12\n\nIt probably depends on how you interpret \"**if it impacts on the ability of the opponent to play or challenge for the ball**\". Like here, it did impact the ability (so offside!) even if the success rate with (or without) the offside player would still be about 0% (so no offside!) from how it looks to us. \n\nBeing able to go for the ball is technically \"challenge the ball\" even if you miss it. \n\nThere's also this (maybe as a point of comparison):\n\n> If an attacking player remains stationary between the goalposts and inside the goal as the ball enters the goal, a goal must be awarded unless the player commits an offside offence or Law 12 offence in which case play is restarted with an indirect or direct free kick.\n\nIn the end: I don't know but I'm also sure that it's not a clear offside or no offside situation.",

I think most people agreed it should have not stood, and I see people making comparisons with this that it should also not have stood. But with Bruno's goal, Rashford was interfering to the point that Ederson had to factor Rashford's movement in to his decision making process. *For me*, that counts as interference. When the offside position has no bearing on the decisions of the goalkeeper, I personally don't think they are interfering play from an offside position.\n\nIt's definitely a close call, and I understand why this would not get overruled by VAR, but I do want to understand why you think this decision is entirely objective and there is no judgement call involved in your opinion.

            "I would say that absolutely should be the case....it's not difficult to dive behind the guy or try to push though him to get to the ball .. by the keeper doing nothing there is nothing then for the attacker to interfere with",

            "And if the keeper is at the other side of the goal these two \"facts would still apply\". And yet we all would hopefully understand that a call against the goal would be silly.  \nSo ofc there has to be some form of subjective interpretation happening here. The call if in the current situation there was an actual hindrance happening, not just a hypothetical one because the offside player stands in the shortest path to the ball saving attempt.",
            "The question is if the offside player is affecting the keeper\u2019s ability to make the save, not can the keeper actually make the save. That\u2019s never been the referee\u2019s role in any facet of the game lol. The answer to the first question is clearly yes. The second question literally does not matter\u2026"

Sometimes shock and awe are the best response. Look at how aggressive the fat guy and his two buddies are before the hook lands and then look how quickly they huddle to the side. Mediation and de-escalation with a drunken mob after a potentially life-threatening projectile has already been launched would lead to more idiots joining in as that would have been viewed as a sign of weakness. Just a drunken mob mentality. Don\u2019t fuck with people equipped and trained exactly for the possibility of your dumb ass trying to fuck with them.",

He is trying to turn him on his stomach so he can arrest him. Don\u2019t think the other cop is trying to stop him there. Looks more like he is trying to help the others because the guy is trying to get up. Hard to tell either way. \n\nFor the punch itself I don\u2019t know. Does seem like that approach is kind of uncontrolled and more dangerous than necessary? But also the fan is trying to punch (?) or grab the officer right before and is fighting back on top of already throwing a bottle? \n\nSeems tough to judge based on a video that doesn\u2019t show the whole situation tbh.

A doctor then forcibly injected John with the emetic through a tube into his nose.[8][9][10] An anesthesiologist was not present to help John in case of an emergency.[7] Then he fell to the ground.[7] The color of his face had changed, breathing and pulse had stopped.[7] After three minutes, two teams of emergency doctors tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate John.[1] John died on December 12, 2001.[11]\u201d",

[Achidi John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Achidi_John) died.

            "Coaches entirely rely on players to execute shit. So they can only make plans which seem to work without miracle performances. While players can control what they do so they go for the miracle, it is them who could try. If a coach has to constantly pray for a miracle shot they are kinda doing something wrong.",
            "This.",
            "4D chess from Shaparenko",
            "Yeah he knows what he's doing. It's kind of amazing in football, you don't think too much about what the attacker will do. You have played a particular pass 1000s of times and at best know what your teammate is capable of so go on and try it.\n\nThere are some players who are good enough to tell the forward exactly what they should fo with the pass too.",
            "The thing is he shouldn't have a chance to score because the keeper should come out and get the ball before thw striker gets to it and it should be fairly easy for the gk to do that. Basically there isn't any spot that he could put the ball in that should give them a chance to score, but the goalkeeper messed up.",
            "Ok, but look at the coaches reaction. If it isn't perfect they give up possession. It's not something you do unless you need to win to save your tournament. Similar to long shots, which are much rarer in league football as opposed to tournament",
            "While making him run into a hard position to shoot from needing basically a perfect touch to score?",
            "The place was slightly overhit. A keeper doing his job would've collected it or blocked the chance.\n\nIt's not a bad pass because the intent was there and it was only a few inches overhit, but I wouldn't say it's amazing.",
            "Let's go golfing!",
            "You\u2019re Swiss, I\u2019d never doubt your neutrality.",
            "That\u2019s why the opposing nature exists, because most players, play all out, and they all think they\u2019re the best, coaches are usually realistic about the rosters they have, that\u2019s why they piss off players they know they need to bench before they overextend",
            "giving possession away to mind game the keeper for the next half, Shaparenko gambit accepted.",
            "Regardless, it's a low percentage play. Hence the term hail Mary. It's nothing against the pass, it's the fact that the striker also has to be at his best.",
            "The passer gave the striker half a chance, the striker made the most of it. Most strikers want balls that they can at least touch, so they can have options to control or one touch finish. This one was definitely on the very high difficulty side, but good strikers will always go for a pass like that.",
            "The most you can ask for as a striker is two touches, really. Defenses aren't letting you eat for free.",
            "The striker made the run in behind and that\u2019s where he got it, he didn\u2019t really break stride and got it right in front of the defender. Good ball.",
            "That is an amazing pass. if Odegaard was making this you'd be raving.",
            ">Making him run\n\nI mean they are called forwards",
            "Seriously lol, it\u2019s insane people are complaining about this pass. Yes the striker needed to control it perfectly, but that\u2019s his god damned job lol",
            "And even if he didn't control it, the striker is supposed to read that play and move into that space. Great vision + Great instinct by the two players."
