            "Is it a faux pas to wear one\u2019s wedding suit after the fact? I\u2019ve thought that it would be a great opportunity to justify buying a nicer suit than I\u2019d ordinarily be able to and use for a while, but I had a conversation with a friend who was a bit confused by that thinking. Basically, because it\u2019s such a special garment, wearing it often would be a bit weird. My thinking is garments can be worn at all kinds of special occasions, so why would a wedding suit be any different?\n\nWhich mindset is correct?",
            " recently came to the realization that my feet are too wide for most shoes, after buying a pair of wide shoes. Now all of my shoes are supremely uncomfortable. Any recommendations for wide toed shoes that aren't dad sneakers? I like to wear boots, and enjoy a slight heel. \n\nAlso, I dance salsa and like to wear dressy pants with camp collar shirts. Any recommendations and flexible dress pants for those of us with bigger legs/behinds? I only fit into 541 Levi's and other athletic fit pants normally. Thank you.",

If you pick a really unique color suit, especially a lighter colored one, people might know pretty easily that you're wearing the same suit as your wedding. Even then, you could easily still justify it by saying \"who cares\", and just get a really interesting suit anyways, but just some ideas to think about.",

Zegna\u2019s recent rebranding (they dropped Emergendildo), which also got rid of the Zzegna diffusion line, has aimed to elevate the brand similarly.",

            "\"Purchase clothing items with intelligence, put them on with care, then do not care about them at all\".\n\nI.e. Buy stuff that will fit into one or more of your existing outfits/other garments, and that will fit into your style. Then wear outfits, not single items. Ensure all of you look good. And then just be confident.\n\nJust try stuff out. Buy entire outfits off mannequins if you want to stay safe. Then as you try outfits on, think to yourself \"what other pants could I wear that would fit with this, that I do not already have?\". Start thinking about what you're actually using, and what your wardrobe is lacking.",

            "Read the basic guides, Google more guides, ask four outfit checks here and in /r/mensfashion. Sometimes you'll be wrong, and it's fine. It's just clothes.\n\nAs for purchasing, look at a stores website for a garment,usually they have pictures which show a complete outfit featuring it. Go try that on, then swap the pants to something wildly different, see what you think about it now.\n\nIt's just a learning process, no-one can just read a guide and become a chef, just like no-one can read an article on colour matching and then have perfect taste.\n\nKeep in mind it's also just aesthetics, fashion, and subjective opinions. Maybe you'll try an outfit now and think it looks great. Then in a month, or a year or two, you'll look back and think \"wtf was I combining\". And that's part of the process :)\n\nWhoever is \"right\" or \"wrong\" is still a matter of opinion. If you think something looks good, then wear it. Just being more conscious of what you wear, over time, will make you a better dresser."

It\u2019s pretty hard to wade through tons of eBay listings and find these things. I really just don\u2019t want to look bad by accidentally buying an orphan suit jacket to wear with jeans and sneakers. I don\u2019t care about every detail",

            "I\u2019m trying to slowly add brands to my like/good fit list. I do miss having boutiques or labels I can visit in person and feel like I\u2019m walking through my future closet.\n\nI have to jump through some hoops right now to try and get a pair of jeans back to Japan that were supposed to be straight fit, but are quite skin tight.",

            "Hey, thanks for the reply. The bride told me that although there is no official dress code, she'd like the guests to come in somewhat colorful outfits. Now, my wardrobe is very limited (I am a newbie at this MFA thing) and assume that I have no suits (and as a university student, no money to afford one as well). Any chance you've got suggestions for an outfit that might work?",
            "Gray pants.  It will be fine.",
            "Patch pockets are the most important thing to look for aside from fabric/pattern. Tweed, corduroy, linen, cotton are more likely to be wearable as sportcoats/blazers than smooth wool. Buttons can be swapped and idk if anyone really notices the vent too much. \n\nOne thing you can do is post pictures of some outfits you like and people here can give you some keywords to search for; or post pictures of jackets you find on eBay and we'll tell you if they're orphaned suit jackets or not.",

            "That\u2019s why you have to know your measurements and ignore sizes",
            "Like ac said, know what measurements fit you best. For shirts, typically I look for chest measurement first and foremost. Then shoulder and length. Then sleeve length. Remember that length and sleeve length can be altered by a tailor. \n\nFor pants, I look for actual waist measurement and thigh firstly, then inseam, then leg opening, and maybe rise. Inseam can be altered easily, as well as leg opening to an extent, but other alterations are tricky and usually not worth it.\n\nPick out some clothes that fit you well already, and measure them so you have something to compare to. If the site you're buying from doesn't provide exact measurements, sometimes I try googling that exact item to see if another website has those measurements listed.",
            "Yeah, personally I wouldn't order from another country unless I absolutely had to. If I can't find a US-based boutique or distributor to order from I'd probably pass on that item.\n\n\"Straight fit\" doesn't mean much; you want to look at the actual measurements of the item in the size you're ordering. If they don't provide them, message their customer service and see if they can.",
            "You don\u2019t want to wear a tie without a jacket",
            "If that's what other people in your industry or social crowd wear then it's probably a safe bet. A mustard yellow tie would work well against a navy suit or blue shirt. Get 3 or 4 ties with different colours and patterns. Small dots or stripes are safe. Then yellow, dark red, navy are all classic colours.\n\nIf you want to start being more fashion conscious, you could try a knitted tie which has a coarse woven texture and adds a lot of visual interest to your outfit. Keep your shirt tucked in with a tie and make sure it's long enough to fall roughly in line with your waistband.",
            "There's a certain amount of risk involved with anything, but I think you'll be good. I'd just follow the normal precautions for any expensive clothes: Wash on the delicate cycle with the coldest water available. Dissolve the OxyClean powder in some water at the bottom of the machine first before adding your clothes. (Honestly if you're really worried you can hand-wash it in the sink and rinse well.) Hang to dry. Only wash one of these shirts at a time until you're sure they turn out ok. Like I said above, the heat/water/agitation is more likely to harm them than the OxyClean.",
            "I would say a button-down shirt and non-jean pants are the absolute minimum to not be disrespectful (unless, like someone else said, you\u2019re on a beach). Cheapest option? Thrift. After that, probably fast fashion and mall places like Old Navy or JC penny (edit: or whatever the equivalent is wherever you are.)",

            "[deleted]",
            "Great. I\u2019ll give that a go, one at a time.\n\nWhat I had done with the white shirts had been to mix a tub of hot water and the oxyclean and let them soak for about 12 hours prior to cleaning. I had done this because I had heard that the oxyclean needed heat to activate.\n\nI will do as you have suggested and ramp up the intensity as needed until I am satisfied with how they look or I have ruined one of them. :|\n\nThanks!",
            "If that\u2019s what you have it\u2019s fine.",
            "Jacket and no tie would be preferable to tie and no jacket but jacket+ tie would be better than either of those.\n\nYou're probably going to be somewhat underdressed in anything less than an actual suit though, so it's just a matter of how comfortable you are with that fact. The bride and groom will be too busy to notice/care, and other guests will be more forgiving if you are particularly young or struggling financially. No one's going to kick you out though, so it's good manners to dress as well as you are able--what that means is up to you.",

But I\u2019m hardly a paragon of MFA either. I mostly just wear practical and comfortable stuff since I work from home. Uniqlo, Lululemon and the like.
