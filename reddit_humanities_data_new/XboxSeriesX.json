            "I feel like there was already so much negativity in the discourse surrounding this game after reviews dropped and people started getting their hands on it. Well, I'm just about half way through and I'm puzzled. This game is fucking incredible. It's exactly what Hellblade is. And it takes the experience to a whole new level. \n\nI'm now convinced that everything Microsoft published is going to be under appreciated. There very much appears to be an understanding in games journalism that feeding the hysteria gets more clicks. So they are no help. PlayStation has the biggest voice of gamers, so their negativity surrounding Xbox, the acquisitions, and anything released exclusively on the console ultimately results in a toxic cloud hanging over every game release. But even the Xbox fan base feeds the hysteria if a release isn't \"better than [similar game on PlayStation]\". Because people seem disappointed that Hellblade 2 is like Hellblade 1, rather than the \"better than God of War\" game that they apparently wanted it to be. \n\nBut as a fan of the first game, I'm loving it. And I honestly appreciate the variety in Xbox Game Studios releases. From Psychonauts 2, to Pentiment, to Hi Fi Rush, to Hellblade, and Starfield, there is so much variety that is severely lacking over on PlayStation this generation. Not that I haven't enjoyed games like GoW Ragnarok or Horizon Forbidden West. But there haven't been any games from Sony that actually surprised me this generation or felt like a unique offering within the industry (Returnal being the exception). \n\nI dunno. I think too many people aren't taking the time to truly appreciate some of these games that Microsoft is actually publishing.",

Why has Microsoft seemingly left the game to come out so quietly? A launch trailer a few days before release doesn't count. They need a win right now and some good press. They should of thrown more money at the marketing for this game. I just don't get Microsoft these days! They'll probably shut NT down for all we know after this.",

            "Oh yea, they have certainly nailed the characters. They have plenty of iconic characters whenever you think of \u201cPlayStation.\u201d",
            "No, why is it always better to have the reviews early? When I read/watch the reviews as soon as the reviews are available then I also want to be able to directly buy and play the game if it looks good.",
            "> I am saying a company limiting reviewer opinions on a product until after the company can start making money on the product is anti consumer.\n\nBut you\u2019re not describing what\u2019s actually happening here. This launch is simultaneous with the lifted embargo, not after, which puts the decision squarely on the consumer themselves: read the reviews first? or purchase first? \u2026 unless you\u2019re referring to pre-orders, which are almost always ahead of reviews and can be cancelled before the official release with a full refund (and the official \"play-early\" pre-orders do not stop early consumer reviews).",
            "I can respect that view if a company were to do that.",
            "Epic adventures are not usually described as being 6 hours long lol. Sorry",
            "A fellow fan of The Good Wife!",
            "It wasn't, the only good thing about the first game was the incredible sound design. The rest of the game was mid as hell.",
            "I never said short = bad. Have you seen my username? Most of SEGA's best games can be beaten in less than a couple hours.",
            "So the words \u201cOut now\u201d won\u2019t mean anything? There\u2019s always a huge ramp up in ads once a game is \u201cOut Now\u201d and if in a few weeks after release they just drop all marketing then I\u2019ll concede that okay, yeah they should\u2019ve done more. But we\u2019re not there yet chief. \n\nAlso THIS GAME IS NOT GOD OF WAR LEVEL. It is the sequel to a previously indie studio\u2019s art house game. They just got improved motion capture tech and increased the budget but we don\u2019t know how much. It\u2019s also being sold for $50.\n\nSome of yall need to properly set expectations",
            "Speaking of knowing nothing about marketing\u2026\n\nThey featured the game [at last year\u2019s Xbox showcase](https://youtu.be/CJ_hoLUHyvQ?si=jI8Zp4n8R1Clf-Yk). Then they debuted a [brand new trailer](https://youtu.be/2v6RL9PW3jg?si=O8XHx7vcbHRpJl70) and [a live performance](https://youtu.be/VWknSd6jbd0?si=SECMnZWKYirgZbYR) at the Game Awards. \n\nAlso this year we got a whole in-depth look at the game [in the Xbox Developer Direct](https://youtu.be/sVue2UHNAkE?si=1x2e5iAQOz-vSFeu)\n\nSo they didn\u2019t just show a trailer 5 years ago and release the game tomorrow, they\u2019ve been continually advertising and showing off the game for the past 5 years. \n\nBut again, I\u2019m talking to someone who claimed it\u2019s a \u201cfact\u201d that they \u201cliterally\u201d just started marketing the game.",
            "So you're specifically mentioning the launch trailer??  Those generally come out about a week before the the game comes out.  Sometimes it's a little before. Sometimes it's a little after, but it's generally around launch time.  You just need to leave me alone now. Okay?  Just go back to your cave, troll.",
            "Right, you were being a dick just to get your point across, cool.\n\nTake care.",
            "That and solving puzzles is going to be the whole game, lol. Have you even played the first one? Don't lie. You people doubting the gameplay of a sequel is new levels of kooky crazy. It's literally going to be slightly improved more of the same.",
            "You're literally spouting console war propaganda. Saying \"They aren't advertising and talking about the game\" despite the numerous trailers, game show appearances and having a big appearance at the Game Awards. But apparently all of that isn't enough.",
            "Seriously? Your own example shows you why it\u2019s better. You watch reviews and it impacts your desire or lack thereof of wanting to play the game.\n\nEdit: I can\u2019t believe there are people advocating for less transparency about a game prior to release. Is everyone here a goldfish?",
            "Or boring walking simulators with terrible combat and terrible puzzles with irritating ASMR constantly blaring out at you",

            "Who\u2019s going to see the \u201cout now\u201d?\u2026 u realize the grand majority of sales matter the most the first two weeks. Especially on a game that isn\u2019t well known. This isn\u2019t GTA or some Nintendo game this is a franchise that had poor sales to begin with and with Microsoft looking to axe brands and studios that aren\u2019t bringing in $ how do you think this game is going to survive? This game is counting on PC sales. Speaking of managing expectations, it seems like doing the same thing that all your other studios that just recently got shut down did is a recipe to also get shut down\u2026 some of you ppl need to open ur eyes and stop pretending it\u2019s all fine when every circumstance recently proves that this boat is sinking. I\u2019m speaking as someone who\u2019s been with Xbox for 22 years. I\u2019m not going to pretend I have a crystal ball and say Ninja theory will be shutdown but I am very confident that the possibility of it shutting down in the next 6 months is extremely high. I also come from a corporate finance background so I understand this from a corp perspective and not just a gamer",
            "When did they start marketing the release date of the game? You know marketing strategies are broken up into campaigns right? Well of course you don't but they are. They **failed** at marketing the release of the game. The VP of marketing at Microsoft literally had to post screenshot on Twitter to prove they were marketing the release because they were doing such a poor job at it and receiving criticism for it lol. When the VP of marketing has to prove that they're marketing they've dropped the ball.",
            "No not the launch trailer. The marketing campaign promoting the release date and launch of the game.",
            "You dropped this \ud83e\udd21",
            "Why are you so obsessed with consoles wars? Someone who plays on the same system as you who disagrees isn\u2019t a console war warrior\n\nThey just have a difference of opinion. Please change the record."

The Xbox One X operates at **1080p**, and the Xbox One S typically runs at around **972p**, though it might reach 1080p on occasion. Across all these platforms, our target is always to hit **60fps**.\"",
