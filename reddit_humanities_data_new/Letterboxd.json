Last month, I changed up my four faves to be the most recent 4.5+ watches (new or rewatch) so that\u2019s been fun. I love scrolling thru reviews after I watch a movie, so I tend to be pretty engaging with other accounts.",
            "I think I've been using letterboxd for over a year now, and my watching habits are a bit sporadic but currently my top four are:\n\nFellowship of the Ring (2001)\n\nTwister (1996)\n\nJoyland (2019)\n\nThe Harder They Fall (2021)\n\nAs for June First Watches, I watched Brokeback Mountain for the first time, and Saving Face just yesterday, both where really good but in my personally opinion I enjoyed Saving Face more. \n\nI try to write long reviews but sometimes I just don't have much to say so it'll fall into a quip (usually with movies i've seen before)  but for others i can talk a lot. So if that's something you're into follow me? I guess?\n\n[https://boxd.it/5EgPZ](https://boxd.it/5EgPZ)",

I prefer lighter movies so you'll usually see me log family films, campy/comedy-focused horror, and stuff that's in cinemas.\n\nI've been busy so haven't had too much time to log a ton of movies in the last few months but my favorite first-time watch of 2024 right now is probably *Ghostwatch* or *Late Night With The Devil*.\n\nI almost always follow back!\n\nRight now my Top 4 is just some random top favorites of mine:\n\n* *Small Soldiers*\n* *Who Framed Roger Rabbit?*\n* *Theater Camp*\n* *Malignant*",

I also now have a lot more time to get through my watchlist after finally graduating!\n\nMy reviews are short/average length as I try and always do them spoiler free and essentially just brain dump what I thought (I take the \u201cdiary\u201d very literally). My star ratings tend to be very subjective, even if I thought the movie was very well done from a technical standpoint, I will rate based on my enjoyment whilst watching. \n\nWould love to follow other active users who just bring good vibes and thoughts to my feed!

I don\u2019t have a ton of IRL friends who use it, so looking to increase my following. It\u2019s kind of boring seeing the same 3 people logging movies, lol. \n\nMy taste is somewhat eccentric. My current top 4 are Aftersun, Blue Valentine, Call Me by Your Name, and Jennifer\u2019s Body (every now and then I swipe this out for Pride and Prejudice). Movies that make you \u201cyearn\u201d are my favorites. I love horror, especially campy horror, and 90s/2000s teen romcoms. I\u2019ve also been getting more into American classics - I\u2019m a big Humphrey Bogart fan, and just recently watched my first Marilyn Monroe movie. I\u2019ve been reading a biography on Marlon Brando, so I\u2019m seeing a lot of his movies for the first time, also. Criterion is one of my favorite streaming services, so lots of movies from there, too. \n\nI log pretty much everything I watch. I do write reviews, but they usually are either short and quippy, a quote from the movie that stuck with me, or an anecdote about my feelings/relation to the movie. \n\nI\u2019ll follow back! https://boxd.it/5g3wx",

            "Hi, I started \u201clogging movies\u201d on my own since 2016, mostly posting them on Twitter just to track what movies I watched. I was hesitant on joining letterboxd since I find it hassling to essentially transfer everything to the site. For some reason last year, around the time of Barbenheimer, I just had a burst of energy and did it. My small movie reviews that I put in tweets didn\u2019t survive\u2014I didn\u2019t transfer them to letterboxd\u2014but I rated them all and put in lists. I also included a lot of the movies I remember watching prior to the year 2016, since that\u2019s when I started logging on my own.\n\nI\u2019m not a cinephile by any means. I barely watched any movie in the 2000s and even much less before that. I was born in the late 90s and as someone from a \u201cdeveloping\u201d Asian country never really gravitated towards a lot of movies until I was in high school in like 2010. Aside from a few movies I watched when I was young, the true gateway movie/franchise that got me into movies (and books) was Harry Potter. I watched Chamber of Secrets in theaters when I was really young. I don\u2019t remember much but I remember simultaneously liking it and being scared of it. I started watching all the movies before Half-Blood Prince came out and read the books before Deathly Hallows came out so it will always have a place in my heart (and a place in my Top 4). I really love fantasy because of that foundation, but really I\u2019m up for anything. A third of my watchlist are classic movies from the 20th century so feel free to suggest more from that time period. I\u2019m also not a very harsh critic/rater so I only have like less than 250 movies in the 2 1/2 stars and below range, so feel free to suggest terrible movies too, I guess.

I think film is highly subjective, and there is a lot of toxicity among \"movie fans\" who insist you have to like a certain type of movie, have at least one foreign film, or include a film from the '60s in your top four.

            "In a good or bad way? haha",
            "Thanks for the rec, that sounds intriguing! And I totally agree, What a Way to Go! is an amazing film and basically rewired my brain \ud83d\ude06 I accidentally binged several of her movies a few weeks ago (a happy coincidence since they were movies I've never seen) and she's probably one of my favorite actresses now.",
            "Yes! I have a whole spreadsheet showing how much I\u2019ve saved and it\u2019s insane",
            "Interstellar will always have my heart. I\u2019ll never get tired of that movie. I think my opinion of Oppenheimer would raise slightly on a rewatch but it\u2019s hard to bring myself to rewatch it just with how long it is lol. I\u2019ve only seen six Nolan films so far, but it\u2019s funny that our top 4 for him at the moment are the exact same: Interstellar, The Prestige, Oppenheimer, and Inception",
            "haha were you towards the back row? The women next to me was singing pretty loudly during that!",
            "followed",
            "in a good way of course. It's a rare combination for sure. I liked Empire Records a lot. Such a nostalgic movie.",
            "That\u2019s awesome! I did rewatch _Oppenheimer_, so I\u2019ve seen it twice, and I actually did like it better the second time around. However, it only moved up to surpass _Inception_ for me. It\u2019s an incredible film, but _Interstellar_ is just perfection. And I have a soft spot for _The Presitige_.",
            "Haha I was second to the back row.  That is my favorite row to sit in.  It's very possible you were sitting behind my husband or behind me!",
            "lol oh my god, what a small world! Thank you for getting her to be quiet(er)!",
            "Haha I doubt you remember who was sitting around you; but I was wearing my bright red hoodie with the Hollywood Theatre on the back.\n\nI hate it when people have audible conversations in the theater.  If you want to talk, watch the movie at home.  But it's an even bigger pet peeve of mine when people sing the music outloud.  If the movie isn't advertised as a sing-a-long, thus I won't be there, then shut up! Sing at home. I had to give her a dirty look because it was so annoying. I'm there to hear Marilyn sing, not her.  I tried not to be a total wet blanket by telling her to be quiet, because I didn't want to ruin her night; but ugh. She also annoyed me with her constant \"oh my gosh\" statements. Lady, obviously you've seen the movie before. Why are you surprised at what's happening? \n\nI'm just glad she took a hint and was a little quieter.  She was annoying my husband and my family too. I was at the movie with my husband, my parents and my sister--because we all wanted to see *Some Like it Hot*.",
            "I had the exact same conversation with my partner. She seemed very shocked for a person that must've seen the movie a bunch! \n\nShe wasn't as bad as the person at Purple Rain a few month back.  Coincidentally it was almost the exact same spot. But during the performance of the song Purple Rain, she took out her phone and held it up like a lighter at concert. Bizarre behavior! \n\nAlso I totally do remember, because I've been clocking those new colored hollywood hoodies. I was on the aisle seat in my movie madness hoodie (I think. That's my usually uniform).",
            "Lol.  For the most part the Hollywood crowd is pretty good. There was a woman last year at *It Happened One Night* that kept loudly gasping at the film.  I assumed that she and her friends weren't avid classic film goers and probably went on a lark.  The one lady kept gasping at anything that happened that was even remotely not okay by today's standards--like when Clark Gable slaps Claudette Colbert.  It was really annoying. She was so annoying in fact that someone actually went to get the Hollywood Theatre staff to talk to her.\n\nAnother time, I went to see *To Be or Not to Be* alone and this woman brought her child who was probably like 9 and 10.  I always sit in the second to back row.  She sat right behind me (I seem to attract the annoying people) and proceeded to explain every single scene at a loud whisper to her child.  That movie's plot can be convoluted to even me, an adult who has seen A LOT of classic films. Why she thought a child would enjoy that film is beyond me.  But her constant explanations were so annoying, I actually got up and moved to the other end of the aisle. I don't normally move during a film, even when someone is annoying; but I couldn't take it anymore.\n\nAt *Gentlemen Prefer Blondes*, this guy in front of me got his phone out and the guy next to him told him to put it away.  The guy with the phone actually swore very angrily at the guy who told him to put it away.  Even though I was behind them, it still felt awkward, because I thought they were going to start fighting.\n\nOn the flipside though, last year we saw a sold out showing of *Barbarella* and that was awesome. The entire audience was into it and captivated by the craziness on screen. The screening of *Red-Headed Woman* last summer was also really awesome. I love when 90-year old films can still captivate the audience.\n\nIf you were on the aisle, you were sitting behind my parents! Lol! I was annoyed that someone at the other end of my aisle was wearing my same red hoodie."

The pacing of Rip Van Winkle is a bit more languid (not necessarily in a bad way) while Lily Chou Chou is really tightly paced IMO.\n\nAnd Maborosi, while being one of my favorites from Koreeda, is pretty unrepresentative of his work as a whole. Regardless I think it would be a good starting point as you can see both his influences from Ozu and his career as a documentarian the strongest. This one is also is told in a very passive/slow manner, which may not be your thing but let me know your thoughts if you get the chance to see it!",

            "Shoplifters was my first Koreeda and I fell in love. It's constantly battling between Maborosi, and Still Walking to be my favorite. Excited for you to experience these films!"

            "\u2022 The armoured car heist goes well. It's well-planned and McCauley escapes with the bearer-bonds. The only complication is Waingro, but McCauley gives the go-ahead to execute the remaining guards in order to get away clean. He almost succeeds in killing Waingro as well (who spends the rest of the film terrified and hiding from McCauley). The only thing tying him to the heist is the nickname \"Slick\" used by Churrito (which honestly shouldn't be a workable angle, but Hanna is just that good).\n\n\u2022 Selling back the bearer-bonds to Van Zandt (the money launderer) should have been a slam-dunk. McCauley is initially against it (he correctly intuits Van Zandt will double-cross him, but his fixer gives him bad advice).\n\n\u2022 The precious metals heist should also have been a cakewalk. It's only because Hanna is so good that it fails--and even then, McCauley's catlike awareness both saves his crew from arrest and turns him onto the police surveillance.\n\n\u2022 The bank heist is where things really go off the rails. McCauley relies on someone else's research, not his own. Van Zandt's thug somehow learns about it and tips off the police. He knows about the police surveillance, but he goes ahead anyway, motivated by dreams of running away to New Zealand with Eady. Pretty much the entire LAPD shows up to apprehend him, and yet *he somehow manages to kill a dozen cops, get the money, and get away anyway.* This one *shouldn't* work out, but his superior training carries the day when his planning fails him.\n\n\u2022 It's after the bank heist that McCauley runs out of plans. He becomes reactive and fixated on revenge. He even admits to Eady after chasing her, \"I don't know what I'm doing anymore.\" Ultimately, after the trauma of spending a decade in solitary confinement, the fleeting taste of intimacy is too strong a temptation. He succumbs to his human impulses. He loses the discipline."

I mean, often times for a 2.5 average film the most given scores are 3 (6/10) and 2 (4/10), with the next most given score then actually being 2.5 (5/10). Meaning a lot more people have to dislike a film for it to have a generally lower average rating. What that means for me, is that the definitions of my personal ratings I give are completely different from the average score, though they don\u2019t vary vastly. A 3.1 average score, for example, I\u2019d think of as mediocre, whilst a 3/5 score that I give a film would mean I thought of it as enjoyable.",

If anything the Flash is a potentially 7-8/10 movie that is potentially bogged down to a meh due to strange choices, unfinished CGI or other flaws; but for me the discussion is much more complicated and polarising than just an agreed \"meh\" or \"It's okay\".",

The acting is good throughout. Dialogue writing is about average for an indy film. The de-aged scene is a little weird but I actually think it works really well for the plot, and the fact that the artefact is in 2 pieces is a novel spin on a normal indy film. The villains are kinda forgettable but the supporting characters are some of the best we've had. The elephant in the room is really that mental >!time travel scene!< but I think it's goofy enough that you can just suspend your disbelief. We've had aliens, whatever. It's not groundbreaking but it's really an enjoyable experience in my opinion.",

If you\u2019re like me and watch movies that are old and we\u2019ll reviewed there\u2019s likely going to be less variance than newer films. \n\nMy average grade is like a 3.75 but I also don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve watched much that\u2019d be considered \u201cbad\u201d anyways.",
