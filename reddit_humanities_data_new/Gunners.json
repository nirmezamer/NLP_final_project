            "Can everyone crying that we haven\u2019t already bought Osimhen and De Jong to the carpet just calm down. Just because you don\u2019t see leaks doesn\u2019t mean Edu is just sat there doing nothing. We probably have a very good idea in mind of what we want to do this summer and we are waiting for the right moment. Half of the leaks that come out aren\u2019t realistic anyway",
            "Not sure how I feel about Bayern seemingly getting Olise and being in a strong position in the race for Xavi Simons as well. Both are players that I could've imagined at Arsenal, and both don't seem to be excessively expensive for Bayern... might be good business for them.",

It\u2019s what I hate about the transfer window, all these random ITK accounts come out desperate for engagement just chatting nonsense.\n\nOrnstein is the only guy I follow on X when it comes to football news. No tweeting everyday saying the same thing over and over for engagement, no chatting nonsense. Just straight substance and he tells you when you need to know it.",

Bruno to Man City for \u00a3100m. \n\nEverton bank \u00a380m, amortise Eddie at \u00a36m and stick too fingers up to Utd. All before 30th June/just after and 3 teams sorting FFP (maybe 4 including Villa).\n\nDon't believe Isak is going btw, nobody would be stupid enough to have CL as a main striker with his injury record.\n\nOlise to Bayern,  does that mean Nelson to Palace?",
            "I have no doubts Eze would love to come back home despite Arsenal letting him go early, his family are Arsenal fans and still go to the games.",
            "TNAT has gone the Bad Ben Jacobs route of telling people what they want to hear, and not what\u2019s actually happening. He fell off.",
            "Before anybody gets too creative with FFP, remember what happened to Juve and their little player swap scheme. \n\nThe other problem is finding players to sell to the cartel, sooner or later they'll say \"nah not interested\". Even worse the player sold for a ludicrous fee could be an absolute dud after 2 years and they'll be stuck with a player with stupid amortisation they have to sell at a loss.",

            "The England squad is massively overrated. Rice, Saka, Kane, Bellingham and maybe Stones are the only players that start for France or Spain or Brazil or Argentina etc.",
            "If we by any chance get Gyokeres, we're eating good. Big, fast, clinical in front of goal, turns like prime Messi, excellent hold up play, can dribble, both footed. He has it all and I really wish we sign him even for a lot of money. He just looks like Haaland on steroids.",

            "Think we're going to have a relatively quiet summer on the transfer front tbh. A lot of the smoke appears to indicate we haven't even really settled on which position we're going to strengthen, a lot of '*if* Arsenal prioritise a forward', '*if* Arsenal prioritise a midfielder'. \n\nProbably speaks to the leap the team has taken, and how close we're getting  that the main area for improvement is around the edges of the team. Feels like any 'core' signing would be 'different option' as opposed to obectivley 'better'.",

            "Gallagher has been the first sub in both games  despite the game-state being different. It was always going to be him. \n\nSouthgate took the likes of Toney, Palmer, Mainoo, Wharton and Shaw for vibes.",
            "Trent is a fucking liability in midfield. Gallagher isn\u2019t a \u201csexy\u201d player but he actually provides support to Rice which means he doesn\u2019t get left exposed and then Bellingham can actually try and affect the game going forwards",

            "Let them. Chelsea\u2019s recruitment is heavily connected to making sure the books are ok, as well as buying players with the intention the go up in value, just like a stock.\n\nWe buy players in the basis of suitability in terms of if they fit tactically and in the dressing room. Thats why we have finished 20 points above Chelsea two seasons running, and will do so again this year. \n\nIt\u2019s manic and reactionary what they do. Does nothing to aid them on the field",
            "They're selling to each other cus they can amortise the cost over the length of the contract, but it counts as pure profit to the selling club in the meantime",

            "Newcastle have isak, and Wilson to back him up.\n\nWhat do they need dcl for? He's worse than both",
            "Easily the latter cos it\u2019s just moaning over literally nowt. \n\nOur second pre-season game is in August, as long as we can get a player in before the American camp there\u2019s not much to worry about",

            "It\u2019s kicking the can down the road and hoping that in the next couple of PSR cycles that they\u2019re back in CL & bringing in higher revenue by then",
            "It's not related to cash payments. It's about how transfers are registered on the club's accounts (fee divided by years of contract)\n\nThey sold Maatsen for 37m, which in theory, this means they could sign 185m worth of players assuming they put them on 5 years contracts (185/5 = 37)\n\nNow this is an oversimplification obviously because there are myriads of factors to consider when it comes to a club's budget like wages and revenue.\n\nBut also, these sales only cover the first year of these payments. If they wanted to keep that 185m worth of players the season after, they'll need to come up with extra 37m either from sales or revenue increase.\n\nSo, this whole thing is basically kicking the can down the road. It's a short term solution to have a wiggle room for the present.",
            "I think the idea is to keep selling high-book-profit players each year and pushing out the reckoning indefinitely. It's not about actual money for Chelsea as much as eluding regulation.",
            "payment structure isn't the same as amortisation.\n\namortisation is just how it looks in the accounting, it's evenly spread across the contract (max 5 years). payment structure is different with every deal and is how the real cash flows.\n\nBut yeah, the previous windows will affect their current one, hence why they're currently having FFP issues. They are just finding loopholes to get around it and engaging in academy player 'trading' with other clubs in the same boat.",
            "People think that if you sell a player, you apparently don't have to pay the club you bought them off the rest of the money you owe them because amortisation \ud83d\ude44\n\nNearly as frustrating as the \"selling a player for 20M means you have 100M to spend on players\" I've seen people suggest. Nope, you have 20 more million.",
            "> Just because you can spread it out over the contract doesn't mean you don't have to pay it.\n\nJust means you don't have to pay *NOW* so you can get money to pay it off eventually while still repping the benefits of signing a talented player.\n\nThink of it as buying a house on a mortgage.",

            "But surely teams should be rewarded for developing talent, the rules make more sense when you think about them in the context of lower league teams who are having to sell players anyway.\nHomegrown registration rules counteract the financial benefits of selling homegrown players. Chelsea just seem to think there smart and finding loopholes",
            "They signed a defender a few months ago, and are eying the youth striker from Chelsea.  Not sure if that ever happened.",

All of these attributes are entirely wasted if you positionally shackle him and force him to sit in front of the defence instead of letting him \"off the reigns\" to use his intelligence and physical attributes to make a difference higher up the pitch in midfield.\n\nRice was an elite 6 for West Ham, who were defence-first. Arsenal is not West Ham. We don't need a defence-first 6 if our midfield and attack is winning the ball higher up the pitch (often in the opposition half).

            "Yeah fine with it, would still like an out and out winger too but would take eze in a heartbeat. \n\nSpurs fans really want him, he could go to united, chelsea or the likes of newcastle villa ect. Would be worth it just to make sure he never plays against us for a big team or for spurs. \n\nAlso a former academy player we let go, is a fan I believe so just a very nice story. \n\nThink tactically, he is essentially what we hope/hoped esr would be a player with elite dribbling in central areas with high technical level and really dangerous in front of goal. \n\nStill think we lack pace if we were to bring him in, if we are fully fit and in form havertz and martinelli are good pacey outlets, but if either of those have an off day we are going to feel like we lack the ability to run in behind as we have many times with this team. \n\nIf we can find a player with elite pace who plays wide (neto, williams?) to go along with eze we are laughing imo.",
