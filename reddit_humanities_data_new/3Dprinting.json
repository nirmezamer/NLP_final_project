You can choose your canopy (infill) and cut it down to find the tree inside.\n\nI've always wanted to print it in multicolor and have the tree be different from the canopy. The model is just the tree and canopy, the pot is a random one I found online.\n\nEdit: forgot to add the [link](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5710622)\n\nEdit 2: if I win a printer that can do 3 or more colors, I'd love to make an apple tree with apples hidden in the infill to find. Especially because I work in the apple industry.",

I went through several design iterations with spirometric testing to find an optimal design that can be rapidly produced by a 3D printer. It is designed as a single object with a pause during printing to insert a stainless steel ball. The design itself can be quickly customized with the patient\u2019s name, and we have seen this creates improved compliance in our subjects. The total production cost per device is about $2, and for comparison, consumer level devices within the same therapeutic category range from $60 to $150. My vision is that as 3D printing continues to become more end-user friendly it will be easier for patients and providers to get dispensable medical equipment at extremely reasonable costs compared to the US healthcare system right now. (shout out to BBL for setting a new bar! I\u2019ve been in 3D design and rapid prototyping for the past 15 years now and have seen it all grow)",

The switch became her favorite console when it came out because the joycon is one-hand friendly, but games that require both joycons were still very difficult. I stumbled across an adapter one day that was designed to let a one handed person use both joycons, but it was very basic and didn't work all that well. So I redesigned it and came up with these!\n\nThere are two different models based on user preference, and I print a bunch of them so that when she goes to events for people with limb differences she can give them out to anyone who wants them! I'm also working on a beefier version that will make the buttons easier to press, similar to some of the PlayStation and Xbox controller adapters, but that's a WIP and nowhere near ready to print",
            "I'm an avid cook who enjoys making a lot of international dishes. As a result I tend to keep a large herb and spice collection. I also greatly enjoy engineering solutions to everyday problems and occasionally over engineering solutions to problems that probably didn't need fixing. Oh, gears. I also love gears and mechanical things. So I decided to engineer a solution to storing all my spices. I didn't want it to stick out too far from the wall yet it needed to hold a lot of little bottles. I also wanted to add a cool steampunk vibe to it. So I designed and 3d printed multiple iterations of a rotating spice carousal, eventually finishing with a motorized spice rack. I jokingly called it the Rosemary-go-round. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xdntcachy65d1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87d084e472a8cddc517d5beb639885a77c68c724",

Additionally, all the supports are built-in, and that's a fun challenge to design. It also had a fairly low failure rate on the first iteration (0.4%) and meets standards (failure rate of <0.01% with 95% confidence) on the current (8th) iteration--it's reliable.

These stanchions show the wear and tear that decades of service to the collection have led to. Many of the loops for hooking the stanchions corda are mangled from visitors knocking them over, to the point where they're gone completely, or soon will be.\n\nThe Gardner Museum also tracks incident reports very closely, as visitorship at the museum continues to grow. An average weekday can see over 500 visitors, and each Saturday and Sunday can see 2000 visitors making their way through the galleries. Like the streets of Boston, the galleries at the Gardner were not envisioned for this kind of traffic. This led to requests for additional stanchions, as Conservstion department data showed they are effective.\n\nUnfortunately, the historic stanchions are made of heavy cast brass, and exploring reproducing them in that manner was quite expensive.\n\nAlso, having a brass base and no ability to do hot work on site, meant fixing them to the floors to prevent them being knocked over was difficult.\n\nMy solution was 3D modeling the head, and main body of the base in Sketchup, and 3D printing those components in PETG. The upright for the stanchion was an extruded aluminum square stock, and the \u2018skirt\u2019 around the base was poplar wood.\n\nThis made it much easier to attach them to the floors, lighter, modular for replacing damage parts if needed, and under $40 in materials to produce.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pniog7ttft4d1.jpeg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c886a8a976aa920109d1eb54ace925c395ae1a3",

            "I don't see rules on how many projects we could share so I have 4 3D printed projects that I modeled myself:\n\nBack in design school (over 8 years ago now!), I took a rapid prototyping class where the semester was dedicated to a single project: designing and RPing a toy. I'm a big Transformers fan so I decided to challenge myself and design a fully transformable Megatron tank. I spent countless hours on Solidworks engineering how it would go from tank to robot mode. I believe the total part count was just under 100 pieces! Also 3D printing then was nowhere close to being as consumer/hobby friendly as it is now so I had to use Shapeways to print every single part then sand and paint it afterwards. That cost me quite a bit of cash and a lot of time. If I had my own 3D printer at the time, I would've printed each part in its color and saved so much more time, possibly even doing multi-colored prints! Anyway, I got an A for the semester and it was put on display in the design building for all to see for a few months.\n\n[Here's a video of me transforming it and showing off the articulation.](https://streamable.com/gzp706)\n\n[And robot mode.](https://www.tfw2005.com/boards/attachments/13118280_1549039398725021_146627087_n-jpg.27591214/) [And tank mode.](https://www.tfw2005.com/boards/attachment.php?attachmentid=27591215&stc=1&d=1464123673)\n\nMy second project is just printing TPU for footwear 4 years ago. I'm a footwear designer now and while I was furloughed during the early days of the pandemic, I decided to keep myself busy and buy a 3D printer to experiment with. Modularity in the footwear realm has always interested me and I wanted to explore ideas of having attachable parts to enhance performance. In this case, I used Fidlock quick-release magnetic fasteners Frankenstein'd onto a pair of laceless knit sneakers and printed a TPU housing for the eyestay rows (what the laces loop through in layman's terms). The result didn't lead to anything spectacular or commercial, but it gave me the opportunity to play with new material and that's what design and RPing is all about to me!\n\n[Here's a quick video demonstration.](https://streamable.com/xkfkry)\n\nThe third project is only noteworthy because it's my top Reddit post lol. My refrigerator handle in my apartment broke so instead of printing a whole new handle, I made a brace instead. Works great and I think it's a clever solution. Also it's my first model that I've shared with other people.\n\n[Here's the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/functionalprint/comments/108lddo/easy_fix_for_a_broken_fridge_handle/) on r/functionalprints!\n\nLastly, my latest project over the past few weeks was designing decor for my wedding at the end of the month. Just simple extrusions and while I could've gotten these laser cut, it felt much more sentimental to DIY it with my fianc\u00e9e (she painted it some of it). Plus it was a lot cheaper lol.

It was my first time learning about and using a slicer to give perspective about how new I was to 3D printing!\n\nAfter running 50 miles in the original shoes (with frequent patching) it was time to retire them. (Timeline hint) When looking for a printer of my own the highly anticipated soon to be released bamboo lab printer was my second choice due to size constraints preventing any potentially larger shoes.

This led into making a custom orthotic for my mom replacing $professional$ $custom$ made ones.\n\nThe shoes used standard cheap 95A TPU and are extremely comfortable, (another timeline hint) however layer splitting has been a major holdback fixed through a recent delve into more $flexible$ TPU. They are not breathable, fortunately this is not an issue for me but I can see how it would be for others.\n\nNo files are publicly available, I do intend to eventually sell them on a small scale once fully fleshed out (I would like to recoup some development cost).

Just above it sits my DAW Interface with the knobs accessible and a little platform and wire guide to keep the headphones. As an extra bonus each of the platforms has pegs on the back so that they can hold up a power strip that powers it and keeps everything off the floor.

The PLA \"glass\" has a thickness of 0.75 mm (5 layers with a layer height of 0.15 mm).\n\nWithout removing the print from the Kapton tape, I placed it in a cheap toaster oven at around 200\u00b0C (392\u00b0F).

You could print directly onto glass, but it often sticks so firmly that glass chips come off with the PLA.\n\n[Here's](https://imgur.com/a/pla-glass-NLGSMwu) an Imgur album I made some time ago about the process.

They have muscles which are used for moving their toes for balance. When princess lost her feet those muscles would have gone so there would be kno way of her controlling a toe mechanism, So our main focuses became having a wide surface area at the bottom to help with balance without the natural movement, some sort of mechanism/means of easily attaching the leg to the stump (settled with a print in place part that is too big to exit the main prosthetic and a piece of velcrow that tightens the slider against the stump), and most importantly the foot had to sit at a 45\u00b0 angle to match a chickens comfortable walking angle.

            "I think there was one they just didn't use it, or it was loose and needed tape to hold it in. Either way, I'm definitely glad it's on the back",
            "Like others said, even 5% would do the trick. Though the light could have been a problem. \n\nPrint looks sick though",
            "5% gyroid is probably all youll really need tbh. And would save up on a lot of filament.",
            "Yes definately crank up the e steps to the point it creats a blob monster",
            "Can you please provide the link to it.",
            "Thank you very much, I will try this too , I have this issue only with white pla, othe colours stick fine",
            "Both would help.",
            "And where is it?",
            ">Though the light could have been a problem\n\nBut with a different pattern such as say gyroid, if its going to be a problem, itll be a really neat looking problem.",
            "Blob monster or organic view on classical architecture?",
            "You're right.",
            "Also if you are Going to end up seeing the infill due to slight transparency of the filament with lights, gyroid at least looks really cool when lit up. Also considering orientation it was printed, more top/bottom layers wouldve also worked while also keeping the infill lower.",
            "Who is it?"
