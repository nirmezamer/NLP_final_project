She knew what Joker wanted her to do was wrong, so she created the little pocket with the swingset to spend her last moments in, and let Batman join her. Her last words being \"Can you stay with me? I'm scared.\" and that's when Batman sat next to her and offered his hand. \n\nBatman - the real one - is a truly sympathetic, heartfelt hero. He's a hero not because he punches people, but because he tries to help them, no matter how bad things get. He knows that deep down, most of the people in his rogue's gallery are hurting, scared, confused, fighting against a world that is always against them in every way and they're desperate to just...make things a little better, even if only for themselves. Harley was a victim of psychological torture. Poison Ivy of abuse and chemical experimentation. Mr. Freeze's entire story is a tragedy of Greek proportions.

Every time Bob shut him down, Syndrome didn't listen and kept trying which made things worse. This especially doesn't work when all the situations that he tries intervening are during crisis where he's a bigger liability than a help. And as opposed to just taking a step back to reflect on his actions, Syndrome goes into full victim mentality mode and decides everyone else needs to pay. It's quite clear that he's just self made victim on top of a narcissist because he doesn't even remember the circumstance where Bob told him to go home correctly. In the original, Bob is focusing on the bad guy while offhandedly telling him to go away. In Syndrome's memory he is full on facing him which shows Syndrome's sense of self-importance and inflated ego. Syndrome wouldn't have made a good hero anyway due to that selfishness. Even if you wanted to go that route, Syndrome instead of using his talents to help other people decides to get rich through making weapons, selling them to whoever, and then uses his money to kill heroes in order to make some scheme where he gets to seem like the hero.

I mean, she was groomed to be the heir of a genocidal dictator that tortured and exiled his own son without a hint of remorse. I think Azula has more emotional capacity than you think she does.",

He was kinder to her than Zuko because she was a firebending prodigy, which meant he piled expectations onto her. By being what he wanted her to be - which let's be clear, he wanted her to be uncaring, that the weak didn't matter, only the strong did - she earned his praise, while Zuko didn't. But she could never earn Ursa's praise, and we see in the show, that ATE at her. She plays it off, but it's very clear how much that impacted her, when she's losing it towards the end of the series, it's not her father she sees, it's not Zuko or Iroh or anyone else, it's the parent she could never please. \n\n\nAzula mimics psychopathy because Ozai IS a psychopath, and he wants her to be like him. But when nobody is looking, nobody is kissing up to her any more, it isn't her father's approval she wants, it's the kind, loving approval of her mother that she both craves and rejects. Just like Zuko, she's at war with herself, she both wants to be the child her father wants her to be AND wants to be loved just for being her. Some part of her likely knows, if she hadn't been a prodigy, or worse, hadn't been a bender at all, Ozai would have rejected her just like he did Zuko.",

And people know the serpentine released the great devourer, not specifically which serpentine, and the anacondai have been almost extint for a long time and people may believe there are none left before Pythor showed up in the city in season 3, correct me if I'm wrong here but I dont think he ever mentioned anything about being an anacondrai or that he specifically helped free the great devourer for the citizens of ninjago to hear, and since ehe changed colors after being eaten by the great devoure people could just not know what snake tribe he is. \n\nLloyd also probably didn't know Harumi knew about him releasing the serpentine which she knows since its stated in a canon book, Garmadon rulez I think it's called, so Lloyd probably thought if he told Harumi Pythor freed the great devourer Pythor would definitely tell Harumi Lloyd freed him.",

            "Let's look at the first time we really see Azula, not in the flashback to the Agni Kai or at the end of Season 1, but on her boat practicing her lightning technique - she's told she's almost perfect, but that's not good enough. A true psychopath would simply lash out and say the criticism is wrong. It was perfect because they did it. She DID shoot lightning, which was the goal. Azula, however, reacts with anger and a hint of fear, \"almost\" perfect isn't good enough... because it's not good enough for Ozai. \n\n\nThink about what she says to Ozai when he leaves her behind during the comet - \"You can't treat me like Zuko!\" - her greatest fear is being rejected by her father, because she's sacrificed EVERYTHING to be who he wants her to be. We see during the beach episode that her mother's rejection already stings her, even if she plays it off afterward. If Ozai rejects her too, what was the point of anything she's ever done?\n\nThink also of how she reacts when Mai and Ty Lee turn on her - she's initially just angry, but then Mai says something she can't handle, something that sounds like what her mother would have said - Mai loves Zuko more than she fears Azula. THAT, more than anything, starts Azula's spiral into madness. That's the second person who outright chooses Zuko over her. It challenges her entire worldview because Zuko is a failure, a loser... right? Then why does he keep getting chosen, especially out of love? \n\nThe answer is simple: Azula is a child who is TERRIFIED of her father. She's afraid of his wrath, and worse, his rejection. But fear isn't enough to keep Ursa or Mai in line... Love overcomes fear. Azula feels alone and afraid despite her bravado. And sure, she may have some impulse control issues, but she's also FOURTEEN and a literal princess, I'd be more shocked if she didn't have impulse control issues.",

What child, growing up in that kind of environment, would show empathy openly? If she does or does not feel empathy, we never see because we never see an Azula who isn't under her father's thumb. \n\n\nBut as I've pointed out twice now, and you've refused to touch on, she clearly feels other emotions that psychopaths ARE NOT CAPABLE OF FEELING, and she expresses many signs that those who work with children are taught to look for as signs of abuse. And again, Azula IS a child, and Ozai IS an abuser.",
