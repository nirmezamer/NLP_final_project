It would have just forced him to rely exclusively on catching the ball high and dunking, he wouldn\u2019t be able to develop any other move.\u00a0\n\nLike imagine your typical 12 year old (reminder he was probably worse than typical too) and how useless they\u2019d be in a u15 league. So much improvement happens at those ages, they\u2019d literally be useless. \u00a0Now imagine that but to dribble you gotta throw the ball down 4 feet lol kid needed to play within his age I think.\u00a0",

I\u2019m sure gameplay wise he\u2019d be fine a year or 2 up, as he\u2019s literally a human cheat code.\u00a0\n\nBut again that won\u2019t improve his game much more, if anything it would make him more reliant on catching the ball at 8 feet and finger rolling it in the hoop. His development in all other aspects of play - dribbling, shooting, movement, etc certainly is at his age group or lower. Give him some room to work on that stuff in the right environment. \u00a03 years up he\u2019d be improving nothing but raising his hand.\u00a0\n\nIf it were my kid I\u2019d fight all day to keep him in age group. Just avoid injury, have dad or coach instruct him to practice more of the mid game to get those reps in even in real games.

            "He takes 2 steps and he's out of the paint lol",
            "He\u2019s not brand new to being tall lmao he was taller than an average man at 8 years old. It\u2019s not like he was hitting some crazy growth spurts like a lot of other guys who get tall during puberty. His height growth has been pretty linear and he hasn\u2019t been freakishly skinny like other big kids.\n\nOn Wemby\n\n\u201cThroughout his youth basketball career, he regularly competed in divisions above his age level, numbering among the youngest players in those divisions.\u201d https://www.britannica.com/biography/Victor-Wembanyama",
            "He was brand new to being that tall though, which is what I said, not that he wasn\u2019t always taller than everyone else.\u00a0\n\nAlso your article actually contradicts itself. It says he played up, maybe when he was 7? Which I guess is fine, everyone\u2019s literally still kids at that point not much difference.\u00a0\n\nBut then it says he played u11 as 10 years old. And u18 at 16 years old. So in the span of 10-16, the exact ages we are discussing, your own provided article seems to suggest Wemby did in fact play in the normal grouping for his age range.\u00a0\n\nAnd again, he\u2019s taller than wemby, likely didn\u2019t start basketball as early, etc. etc.\u00a0\n\nAnd even if your wemby point was valid (which it seems it wasn\u2019t), there\u2019s no right or wrong way of doing it. There\u2019s like 8 people in the world this applies to lol so if wemby did it good for him. I still personally would not be comfortable putting my kid up with much stronger competition for the reasons I provided - injury risk, practice lower level skills, etc. it seems wembys parents agreed though.\u00a0",
            "Again, no he was not brand new to being tall\n\nAge 8: 6\u20191\nAge 9: 6\u20193\nAge 10: 6\u20195\nAge 11: 6\u20197\nAge 12: 6\u20199\n\nIt\u2019s not like a lot of kids who grow 5+ inches in a year. Those kids are awkwardly skinny because their body is catching up with the growth in such a short time. This kid was born big and has consistently been big his whole life. On top of that, it\u2019s not like 14-15 year olds are even that big themselves. Average height for a 14-15 year old is a flat 5 foot. Those kids likely are barely 100 pounds. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m saying he needs to be playing the best of the best at that age but he definitely should have been playing local kids that were a little bit older than him. Your average \u201cbig\u201d at 14-15 years old in Canadian middle school is likely 5\u20199 to 6 foot max. Even if he was a liiiitle bit awkward at his age, he\u2019s 200+ pounds and it would be damn near IMPOSSIBLE to not be stronger than every single kid.\n\nAs for the article when is 10=11 or 16=18? He did NOT play in his age range. Even kids who won\u2019t amount to being a pro level athlete pay up some age groups. You\u2019re acting like 14-15 year old Freshmen don\u2019t ever play against 17-18 year old kids in highschool all the time. I\u2019m\nnot saying at 12 he needs to be playing 16 and up."

The only stat of his that\u2019s suspiciously better at home were blocks where he had 203 at home vs 110 on the road. That I\u2019ll give you is definitely home cooking. But you could use his road average for his home games and he\u2019s still way ahead of everyone in steals and assists.\n\nEdit: just to contextualize how insane the 88 Jordan numbers are, Stockton recorded 87 more steals at home than on the road over his career.

In the '80s, the home team annually registered about 800 more blocks and about 450 more steals than the road team leaguewide, per Basketball Reference tracking. Over time, those home/road disparities began to even out, significantly so in the Adam Silver era. This past season, the homer effect on blocks and steals disparities has all but disappeared, just 135 more blocks at home than on the road and a measly 13 more steals leaguewide.\n\nAccording to the league office, in an effort to ensure the most accurate statistics, the NBA has used modern technology to apply real-time auditing of stats during games since the 2018-19 season. In today\u2019s environment, with more eyes on the game and a greater attention to detail in the legalized gambling era, the home/road disparity is now all but gone. The homer bias, at least statistically, seems to have been eradicated.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean accusations haven\u2019t surfaced. Last year, when a Redditor claimed that Jaren Jackson Jr.\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year candidacy was propped up by homer-biased stats, the power of the Internet and access to video technology services allowed an army of NBA writers to instantly pull up Jackson\u2019s hundreds of blocks and steals and evaluate their validity. The verdict was delivered within minutes and it was unanimous: the blocks and steals were legit.\u201d",

Ryan, the longtime writer for the Boston Globe who was inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame for his basketball coverage dating back to the 1960s, says questionable statkeeping was an unfortunate stain on the game.\n> \n> He remembers similar controversies surrounding Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s and Bill Russell\u2019s rebounding numbers in the 1960s. Their respective teams traded accusations that the opposing scorekeeper padded the stats to help their giant. Looking back, the numbers are indeed startling. Between them, Russell and Chamberlain registered 26 games with 40-plus rebounds. None of the 26 games were tabulated on the road, per Stathead.com tracking.\n>\n\n> \nAs hard as it is to fathom now with fiery \"First Take\" debates and social-media wars of modern-day media, Ryan emphasized how insignificant the league-wide awards were back then \u2014 especially a second-tier award like Defensive Player of the Year. Voters back then almost certainly didn\u2019t fill out ballots with the same rigor as modern-day voters when a single vote can amount to tens of millions of dollars in a player\u2019s supermax extension because a player won Defensive Player of the Year.\n\n> \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that big a deal,\u201d Ryan says now in an interview with Yahoo Sports. \u201cNobody focused much on it.

He liked assists so much, he was out there essentially playing a different game than the others, who mostly want more points on the board, while Rondo wanted those assists.\n\nHe'd pass up shots or dribble away from open lanes he could have, just to get a chance to pass the ball to someone else.",

Then there's one made not by John Krasinski, not by Victor Erice, not by Charlie Kaufman or something, but by KOBE BRYANT. That's like coming with a bazooka to a knife fight.\n\nAs a movie, I think that most people who are into movies would agree that it was probably the least interesting one ever nominated lol.\n\nIf there was any big reward for \"having an Oscar\", I guess more people would try it, but I cannot recall any other celebrity making a movie about themselves (or about anything tbh) and submitting it for Oscars.

And, like, being attracted to Kobe Bryant is definitely a major part of the demographic that actually decided to watch and rate this one. I wouldn't say this ranking reflects an average comparison opinion then.\n\nIt's also 13 votes, which really says it all. It's probably the most famous short movie ever made and it has 13 votes.\n\nIt's a really niche thing in broader cinephilia fandom. For example, Don Hertzfeldt's movies were getting a ton of awards in the world but can have like 5 or 30 votes on Letterboxd. But when he put three of those movies together and released as one hour-long movie - bam, that one has over 6 000 votes on Letterboxd.",

Of course people who don't like Marvel are less likely to rate Marvel movies, but you can generally say those are rated relatively to other Marvel movies, in some part to all other popular action films, etc. \n\nAs for \"Dear Basketball\"... in that aspect, it's just its own category of one.\n\nGenerally film critics do not see point of comparing various movies, even positive reviews of \"Dear Basketball\" do often say it's pretty vain or really just Kobe's fans and still see it as a good product in the sense its reaches its goals. It's generally a good approach because who cares about the movie compared to something completely else. Well, technically film awards do, that's the trick here.",
