But any opinions that disagree with this concept are welcome as well, so long as they don't violate Rule #1 here!  Love!",
            "How do you handle things that shouldn't be political, but people make them political by being assholes?\n\nFor example: when insulin became far more affordable in the US. That's about as objective as you can get when it comes to good news. But on every post about it I've ever seen, there are assholes who are talking about how big government is intruding on the rights of private corporations, and how it's going to stifle innovation, etc., etc.\n\nWould a post about insulin prices being capped then be removed because it's \"political?\"",

This just becomes \"political posts are allowed unless they're contentious around the moderators' politics\".\n\nThat's just the reality of trying to be apolitical.",

Anything a governor does is political.\n\n- A man spent 44 years in prison after a wrongful conviction? Uh oh, people might ask why that could occur, or who's responsible, or if there was injustice in the appeals. Better scrub it.\n\n- The US economy got more jobs? That's an instaban.

Anything, pretty much, can be considered political beyond the most natural events with no other human involved (like a person recovering from a serious disease or a lost pet being returned.) There are certainly things I've posted in this sub that haven't led to a flamewar that could be considered political, but which most people seem to agree was uplifting. For me, the posts themselves can be sorted by the voting system organically deciding what ends up being easily visible and the comments could be sorted with a quick mod call.

Yeah, it's got the political transgender issue, but that by itself can just be taken care of by moderating the comments to kick out the whiners on both sides.

            ">Together with researchers from Aarhus University, the research team founded a spinoff company in which they developed a barley variety that produces pure amylose in its kernels. This new variety is important because pure amylose is far less likely to turn into a paste when it interacts with water compared to regular starch.\n\nI was going to complain about pesky researchers messing with the future of my beer supply chain but this is actually pretty cool!",
            "This gives me so much hope!\n\nSimultaneously, I hope Big Plastic doesn't kill the invention beforehand. I would absolutely pay extra for the option to not contribute to the swirling masses of ocean plastic. I hope more people learn about alternatives such as this and that consumers will start to demand biodegradables.\n\nEdited for clarity and to not be a Debbie Downer.",
            "Sounds pretty good, especially the decomposition demo. Most bioplastics are just standard polymers made partly from or filled partly with some kind of plant material. \n\nThe only issues I see are that packaging doesn't generally sit around for 40-60 days in the environment and that people with Celiac disease or an allergy to the starch sources are going to be pretty hosed. Corn starch, for example, is allowed to contain 0.5% protein that can cause allergic reactions.",
            "This is great! But as someone with Celiac I\u2019m not sure what to think lol",
            "Nice, now our bloodstreams can be filled with barely micro plastics.",
            "Interesting! A graduate student at Syracuse University did this with my spent grain from brewing like four years ago. I still have the piece of plastic from his first successful go.\u00a0\n\n\nIt was cool then and it's still cool now.\u00a0",
            "Feels like some new solution is always getting developed. Plastics made out of mushroom, algae, corn. Fungus and worms that can eat plastic. \nAt this point I\u2019m more interested to know if or when any of these will be widely used/available, because it also seems like the microplastics news is getting more dire and unfixable by the minute. \n\nI\u2019m so tired of being fed hope only to go to bed starving because it was actually just greenwashing or some pet project to give the *appearance* of trying. \n\nUgh, I think this is my sign to get off my phone for the day.",
            "Do you want to know why it\u2019s 100% biodegradable? Because it BARELY plastic!",
            "What's the catch this time?",
            "Awesome. Can\u2019t wait to never hear about it again",
            "I got one word for you: barley",
            "But will it make me and the frogs gay?",
            "So I can make beer from my extra packaging?",
            "Great invention that I will hear from again \u2026..sad",
            "I don't know why we don't go back to cellophane. It's made from plant cellulose and biodegradable.",
            "I'd like to see a resurgence of cellophane as well. It's plant-based and biodegradable. There are some modern closed-loop systems, and it does have good properties for some purposes.",
            "As long as the public doesn\u2019t hate the bags like SunChips",
            "We have compostable wheat plastic in the US, commonly seen used in \u201csilverware\u201d packets at more environmentally aware takeout restaurants, but the issue is the waste stream. Nothing biodegrades in a landfill, and the vast majority of people in the US don\u2019t have easy access to compost.  It\u2019s sort of like recycling in the US. It sounded great, but most places don\u2019t have a good solution for how to use the plastic and other materials even if they have separate waste streams.",
            "Right? Like, does the amylose have gluten in it?",
            "My bloodstream is already filled with barley most nights, heyoo",
            "Meh, you'll...\n\n...*barely* even notice 'em!",
            "Well put and aptly self-assessing. Go to bed, homeslice.",
            "Wow, I had no idea it wasn't just plastic! It could definitely be put to more use.",
            "It's got to be a win simply that it isn't plastic even if it doesn't break down easily.",
            "More importantly, can they control the processing of it to completely remove the gluten? For instance, liquor made from glutenous grains is still gluten free because gluten does not evaporate. However, you still have to truly trust your distillery to not contaminate it. \n\nTwisted Path Distillery in Milwaukee markets their grain liquors as gluten free because they're 100% certain they do it correctly, 100% of the time.",
            "Big bread guy right here.",

It's also much more common to track elk on a managed game property. It's also much much more common to have a donkey with a managed herd, because donkies are badass at protecting managed herds of all kinds.\n\nYeah, it might be legit. My bullshit detector says otherwise tho.",

Idk if you\u2019ve ever been out west but private and public lands often Criss-cross with little to no physical boundary.\n\n On top of that, local, state, and federal orgs conduct studies on wild animal populations often by tagging them. For all we know, they tagged bulls with large harems to track herd movement across the valley.",

            "Oh okay. Well it\u2019s good to have a healthy dose of skepticism on the internet, but this is a fairly innocuous story about an owner missing his pet and finding it happy. \n\nIf you can\u2019t believe this one\u2026 how do you trust ANY other media on the internet?
