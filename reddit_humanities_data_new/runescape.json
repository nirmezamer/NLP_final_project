            "I don't have an issue with the patch week, especially after last week's content and given what's coming next month.\n\nWhat I object to is MTX being promoted as the headline update, and even moreso I object to TH stuff being integrated into skills. The new ritual nonsense should have come from Um content, not from TH. Furthermore, it sounds like a new ritual that might be stuck on the Ritual selection menu using a TH item - that is completely unacceptable to me if so.",
            "\n>Grab the candles and ink - it's time for some Raising Rituals! In this new promotion you will complete rituals for a variety of necromancy themed goodies!\n\n>Imp soul in a box - The imp's soul trapped in this box will aid with one alteration ritual glyph during your next ritual in exchange for their freedom.\n\n>Token of the lost - The souls trapped in these tokens will protect glyphs and light sources from decaying for one ritual each.\n\n>Unfinished Business (sealed) - These sealed last requests left behind by a necromancer will task you with completing rituals in exchange for extra experience upon completing the request! You get bonus progress for completing the specific type or ritual requested.\n\n>Lost Keepsakes - Items with a connection to something which was lost, these can be used in a new ritual at 25/95 Necromancy to earn experience and ectoplasm like a regular rituals but also some retrieved lost items which can include things like necromancy supplies or a chance at the elusive Soul Dye!\n\nThese should be items obtainable/craft able in game. Not MTX bullshit.",
            "The God Armours look nice, i just wish they weren't obtained through MTX, and were used to graphically update the current models you earn in-game. The current Rune/metal armours haven't received a graphical update in over a decade\n\n>*On 6 March 2012, rune armour, along with many other armours, received a graphical rework -* RS wiki\n\n[https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/g=runescape/player-armour-gnomes-and-clan-fealty](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/g=runescape/player-armour-gnomes-and-clan-fealty)\n\n  \nIt's demotivating seeing so much content revolve around MTX",
            "\"Aura overrides should now appear whenever the Ranger Roll, Hall of Fame, Wraith, Enforcer and Running Scared walk animation overrides are active.\"  Love this!  Now if weapons could work with walk animations that'd be grand.\n\nEdit: aura overrides now are broken on all walk overides",
            "I am surprised they actually added another god aligned armour, thought they would never do that again.\n\nAs I always tell myself, I rather have cosmetics be purchasable with runecoins than that spinning thing.",
            "Just want to follow up from last week. Could we get confirmation that the T&S mattock (7 focus) is only supposed to be 3-7% better at obtaining materials, augments aside, than a bronze mattock (0 focus)? Is it intended for that stat to have such little impact?",
            "\"Players can now use Bladed dive with Balarak's sash brush and Skeka's hypnowand.\"\n\n\nThanks. That was really bothering me.",
            "Am I the only person angry that these existing armour \"cosmetics\" are MTX and not just an update to the actual armour in game?\n\nWhy is the in game armour that you actually have to earn (for ironmen) look worse than the MTX version you pay for with real money? I guess I answered my own question there, I just wish it wasn't this way.\n\nI remember when armours/weapons used to get graphical updates and didn't require real money to get.\n\nI'm not against cosmetics for real money btw. Jagex are a business and need to profit. I just think existing armours and weapons that are used in actual gameplay should be excluded.\n\nAll that said they look great and I wish they were an update to the actual sets with the option for retro override.",
            "Even though it's a patch week with mtx, I really like how we now know the mods who are working on rs3, feels more personal now.",
            "These new armours should just be graphical updates. People can pay for a new trim or something instead. Or a slightly more buff version with spikes or something. It makes no sense having the old models on clues that look inferior. And Aurora dye and Soul dye should be on clue rewards already. It's been over a year.\n\nHave a grace period of 6-12 months where the content becomes part of the game and people who buy it get it as an early bird bonus. Or they get a little buff to make it look more impressive when the armour gets added to the main game for everyone. Because these look great but shouldn't be locked to just MTX. Just communicate an ETA when it's in the main game for everyone and people who support the game by buying it early get the exclusive tier 2 version unlocked. Something that looks a bit better but everyone can still get the base version. A bit like elite sirenic vs regular sirenic.\n\nThe retro stuff can be permanently MTX. But the graphical upgrades need to be added for everyone in the game eventually.",

            "Oooh! Spicy patch notes. Thank you for the buffs to the off-hands, and for fixing deaths swiftness!",
            "This should just be an update to the visuals of the actual items, not just micro transactions to be sold. \n\nMake actual real items look cool please Jagex. I appreciate all you're doing right now, but the look of your actual gear matters. \n\nSure, sell the override, but the actual items should look like this too.",

            "It would not surprise me to see these implemented as permanent, non-MTX in-game content in anywhere from 6 months to a year.",
            "Yea but with the Soul Dye they need to keep getting these out. If not then they make it a new rare. Best way though would be to add soul and aurora to clues.",

            "That edit is hilarious",

            "The main impact of better mattocks is precision which drastically increases speed at your archeology excavation. Like the wiki example will note an Orikaklum mattock with 40 precision excavates an artifact in half the time it take as a mythril mattock with 20 precision.\n\nDoing stuff with a bronze mattock vs a T&S you get significantly more artifacts per hour and that leads to a drastically higher exp per hour. The focus bonus in materials is comparatively smaller.\n\nThey don\u2019t want to overly inflate material gain because they need to make sure artifacts per hour outstrip the materials you gather to create the supply and demand that makes archeology such an economically healthy skill.",

            "The community should have had an uproar about this when they did the guilded armours and such. I wasn't playing back then so I wasn't there. But the community sure did go crazy about hero pass. So really have to ask, does the community even care enough? Answer is nope.\n\nSelling the armours is really just selling nostalgia. Nostalgia is honestly a drug and is being abused/monetized a lot, if you haven't noticed (endless remakes/remasters/rereleases).",
            "It also means we know who's at fault when it's a value-reducing update like this one.",
            "They recently updated Pernix and made the old version a free override if you own the set, so you can have both versions. I'd have liked for them to have done this with all the metal armours so bronze-rune all look how they do in the above image, but keep the original 07 retro as MTX; and the EOC armours as free overrides.",
            "Hey now I like the base armors and weapons way more than any overrides with the exception of that sweet nezzy helm. I am probably in the heavy minority though.\u00a0",
            "Not mtx not priority\u00a0",
            "Still leagues better than selling it via TH.",
            "You get two distinct armour sets for that, so it's actually logically priced. I'm mildly shocked they went back and added a kiteshield to retro Sara, I thought it would never happen after all the whining around retro cosmetics.\n\nI'm guessing this also means guaranteed retro Guthix coming at some point.",
            "That is a completely incorrect accusation.\u00a0 Awhile back they held a poll saying they are going to make a handful of retro cosmetics to sell and would hold a poll to see what players want from this project.\u00a0\n\nWhat won was the dragon scim, dragon claws, whip, helm of neizot, and god armor. Since then they have been working on these slowly on the side while getting player feedback on \u00a0how to approach them, how to sell them in terms of packaging, sharing designs, finding out if people want a remastered retro or a pure retro (they ended up doing both because it fairly split on what players took retro cosmetics for), etc\u2026\n\nThey have finished and released most of the list winners, god armors are some of the last they still have Guthix to do after this to complete the set.",

            "It isn't, but this week would just be a patch week if the MTX was removed.",
            "We got a new Digsite this month. Stop it.",

            "?? We got a new boss last month and have a huge bossing update next month. There are always going to be slow patch note weeks from time to time. We also just had our core update for the month last week, you make it sound like we have had no content for weeks and have nothing exciting on the horizon all because\u2026the games aren\u2019t coordinating their marketing so they announce their big updates on the same week?\n\nAlso no players care about? They asked players which cosmetics they wanted to buy, held a poll, and the god armors won. They only exist BECAUSE players care about them.",

            "250 RC is reasonable for outfit and replica that cannot even be recolored and is a cheap copy of similar outfit, not 630\n\never since marketplace got released nothing has reasonable price, its like double inflation: \n\n* bonds get more expensive (both in game and IRL)\n* AND you need more bonds to buy cosmetics",

My complaint is largely about MTX being the highlight to the game as often as it is, but if you and many other people are that eager to wash it down without complaint then I guess this game deserves it's slow agonizing death, I'm just sad to see it.",

        "content": "As someone who does a lot of melee, I do actually appreciate what the March combat update did for Leng swords.\n\nMy only real gripe, and I can't be the only one, is rather simple: when you gain a primordial ice stack and proc Frostblades, you get a 9s duration for it. If you gain another primordial ice stack with Frostblades active, it resets the duration to 9s instead of adding the time to your existing Frostblades time.\n\nThis is particularly annoying with getting quick/consecutive primordial ice stacks, especially on multi-hitting attacks like a dragon claw EoF. Essentially, you lose potential time on Frostblades by getting lucky.\n\nI realize that there's balancing at play here because it could be an issue if you could endlessly stack Frostblades time. I would suggest at least allowing a maximum of 15-18 seconds for Frostblades (18s, optimally, allowing 2 consecutive primordial ice stacks to give 9s of Frostblades each).\n\nIt's not uncommon to get primordial ice stacks in quick succession, and if Frostblades could allow you to have more than 9s at a time it would feel like less wasted potential when it does happen.",

            "I would in all honesty think that's a pretty bad idea and instead want something else, my primary gripe with leng swords is the chance of getting the stacks is too low. Personally I've tried to do some raksha pool skips and it's just not fun. I did the entire p1 and four times in a row ended up with 0 leng stacks when it came to the point where I'd typically use leng spec. Next kill I got 5 stacks off that bat. It's super inconsistent.\n\nAs for your suggestion, yeah, it sounds cool, but you're getting 24% dmg if we take my situation for 45 seconds, they'd have to heavily reduce the amount of extra dmg frostblades provide which is why I'd just like to see the chance increased for more consistency",
            "I basically only melee.\n\nDefinitely would need testing, because as it stands Melee is very powerful and competes with Necromancy at many bosses for speed kills.\n\nWould definitely feel nice, though the reset on the buff to seconds isn't bad as is.",
            "no, getting infinite boost is not the point of this equipment\n\ninstead just activate some effect if it procced while there was still time, like 5% ability damage for each tick remaining, so procing it back-to-back will hit for 60% and reset timer back to 9sec",
            ">As for your suggestion, yeah, it sounds cool, but you're getting 24% dmg if we take my situation for 45 seconds\n\nThis is why I suggested capping it at 15-18s. It allows for a quick/successive primordial ice stack to not go to waste while making sure extreme luck with multiple procs doesn't make it unbalanced.\n\nI don't think this is adding in an extreme level of unbalancing, at least not enough to require reducing the overall effect.\n\nIf it were changed to be more consistently proc'd with a higher overall chance, I think that would throw off the balance more than my suggestion. Assuming you'd be under the Frostblades effect far more frequently if that was the case.",

            "You make competing with necromancy sound like a bad thing. Necromancy is one rotation with absolutely zero switches, best sustain, and best aoe damage. Melee on the other hand is a very click and switch intensive style great for only 20(24) seconds of zerk with the worst sustain and aoe. Melee hands down should be out dpsing necromancy. Otherwise what would be the point of different combat styles."

Nobody can take it because hes so much stronger then a mortal on a fundamental level.

He recognizes he has some Familiar love for Khazard, even if he really doesn't care for him. All someone would have to do is take him hostage and Zamorak would more then likely act or trade.

The simple answer is just that the gods can't breed cause any partner they'd attempt to share (save the WG) would just die the moment they would attempt to clap the persons cheeks.
