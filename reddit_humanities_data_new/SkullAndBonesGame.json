I would like to see a list of calls for help sorted by expiration, instead of a temporary pop-up.\n2) Finally fixed Master Distillers!!! \ud83e\udee1\ud83e\udd1d\n\u2014\u2014 a long lasting bug from season 1, this will help dramatically, and most players had no idea they were affected by this.",
            "Man, I hope this fixes Xbox crashes. I love this game, but it's nerve racking every time I log on knowing my Xbox will lock up at any moment.",
            "Wow this is looking like a great patch",
            "Smol ships let\u2019s gooo!",
            "Love the patch but still we need more warehouse space. Its hard out here",
            "Reducing the bounty cooldown is great. I could only do this once every two days.",
            "Love the fast travel changes.",
            "I like the changes to call for help. They will help getting more participants for events.\n\nNow please show **all** ongoing events on the map. It happens too often that one player can see an event while another player on the same server cannot.",

Or the ones who claim \u201cSnB doesn\u2019t listen to players\u201d even though there was legit asking for feedback in discord about game difficulty,sea monster and dragon racing.",

            "Holy sh*t this is huge. \n\nFast travel to events?  There\u2019s going to be tons more action.\n\nBonus to labs offline?  This is crazy. I don't even think this was a bug, I honestly think this was capitulation. but I'll take it.",

            "Thank God for the call for help. I absolutely detest traveling times to events. I get that sailing is the part of the game, but to spend multiple minutes at a time to get from place to place is too time-consuming. Also, even TD2 has fast travel while outside and to POI.\n\nContract timer reduction is also nice. Hated the 24h timer thing.",

            "Can someone tell me where to go to file a ticket with Ubisoft, I tried there website but got stuck in a loop where I got to the end clicked submit and got deposited back at the start with an error message. But I bought the premium season pass and have received zero rewards from the premium season pass even though I have completed the whole damned thing. So they just stole my money.",
            "Instant travel to Call for Help is amazing. I'll finally start joining some!",
            "That call for help fast travel is beautiful! Soo many times im in the middle of the ocean and seeing a call for help i want to join but its like 5km to the nearest dock so i ignore it.\nThis will have a lot more people join events!",

            "I love what I am seeing in this patch. I do hope that it works as intended. \n\nA future QOL change I am hopeful for would be to either deconstruct unused equipment for salvage, or to utilize unused, common materials to create salvage to use for ammo, medpacks, etc.",
            "Woah!! Didn\u2019t expect that",

            "what the hell most of these are great. so they actually can make good decisions\n\nof course most of these should've been there since the start, like fast travel to events but whatever",
            "What about the players that are still unable to purchase the battle pass due to a bug?",
            "Finally something after this long.",
            "I suggest they give us new space for each location or at least the docks that would double it",
            "Honestly all these additions and fixes sound pretty awesome. I'm excited, been going hard this past week.\u00a0 Was hoping this patch would address all the top level gear and what not that disappeared with the upgrade and delete your ship bug, but pirates are known for their patience, aaaarrgh.",
            "I still need the trophy for East Indies Explorer to be fixed. I know I have been to every single region (3x) and still no trophy. Please fix the bug, Ubisoft.",

            "Finally the option of the division. Well done",
            "22 minutes in, and my Xbox crashed. Fix this already! You've had 3 months since launch and it was occurring in the betas before that. It's worse in S2 than it was in S1.",
            "Still no fix for the East Indies Explorer trophy. Still stuck at 27/28.\n\nBefore anyone tries to give me advice on how to unlock the trophy, realize that *nobody* has unlocked the trophy since the day Season 2 dropped according to PSNProfiles. They claimed they fixed it and they literally **did not**.\n\nYes, I checked every inch. Yes, I double-checked. And yes, I triple-checked.\n\nWhy can\u2019t they fix this damn achievement/trophy once and for all? This is insane.",
            "Need more warehouse spaces. Please even if we have to buy them at this point...",
            "Thanks for the new features. Fast travel to call for help, strongly reduced CD on bounty contracts and the reduced recovery time for defenses (can't be bothered to do them most of the time) strongly improve the game and make those annoying farm groups obsolete.\n\nCREW BOARDING - please change the mechanic to a general boarding allowance at 5% health. People just don't get the system and randoms constantly sabotage boarding attempts by using the crew attack just before boarding becomes available. It's extremely frustrating setting up a boarding manoever to see it destroyed by another button-mashing maniac.",
            "This is amazing!!!  I have seen a lot more group play and people answering calls for help since starting S2....im imagining this change will increase that even more!  I know I'll answer most every call now!",
            "I would have settled for being able to ping back that I'm on the way, but this is way better!",
            "You are qualified to be a call center representative!!",
            "Now let\u2019s get them on the warehouse space problem \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude03",
            "Master Distillers is the 30% bonus chance for Sainte-Anne. Master Apothecaries is the same for Telok. Did they fix both or just the one because they were both not working when offline.",
            "The number of stuff I must have been missing since I usually just log in to start production due to my limited time no wonder I am always running out of silver like crazy",
            "For me it happens in the middle of a defense. Not every time but that's where I notice it the most often.  By the time I get rebooted I have failed and locked out.",
            "The struggle is real. I\u2019m buying from every trader at every port I stop in. It\u2019s really time consuming to loot shipwrecks too for a chance at getting some metal salvage. \n\nMetal Salvage and other crafting materials like that should be purchasable on the black market.",
            "Just take a day to just farm salvage. This should net you a good stockpile for cannonballs and other ammo as well.",
            "Yeah, I just noticed this aswell. Bounties aren't refreshing every 30 minutes. Unless they meant if you fail it you can try again in 30 minutes? Not sure, would have to test.\u00a0\n\n\nGrabbed ah pak and immediately abandoned it. Will report back if it refreshes.\n\n\nIt did not refresh after 30 minutes, also didn't after changing servers. This seems to indeed be bugged.",
            "Yep, so disappointed.",
            "Answer the call",
            "It would definitely be nice to let someone know you\u2019re answering, but in lieu of that, immediately fast traveling to it is just as good.\n\nAlthough it would be nice to know how many people are joining in.",
            "More better than writing im go away camrade",
            "How many calls do I need to answer for a promotion?",
            "They know about it as they mentioned about it in the last deck. Hopefully they figure out a way to make it work.",
            "Good question!!! Will have to test it tomorrow",
            "Probably the only use I\u2019ve found for the PlayStation Portal. Worthless device in so many ways\u2026 other than logging in every 2 hours when I\u2019m home to grab helm mats.",
            "It seems to happen to me with no rhyme or reason whatsoever. On foot, on water, 1st person, 3rd person, in a menu, etc... No time is safe, lol",
            "I was thinking we should be able to craft cannonballs with salvaged metal or by using iron ore or cast iron \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
            "Gotta treat it like wow, some days I just have farming days where I'm forcing open shipwrecks and in my dhow hunting crocs and sharks for my food \ud83d\ude43\u00a0",
            "\ud83e\udee1",
            "9 hours per day with no lunch break",
            "Yeah, and they dodged the answer with some lame response like it being a memory issue\u2026 with all the shit in this game, I find that very hard to believe adding 20 slots for each player would break the game\u2026.",
            "You can with salvage metal but you really have to constantly search and when you do get some it\u2019s not much one or two here or there but using actual metal we could harvest would help more",
            "I just get either coconuts or bananas for me",
            "20 Players using 200 Slots to store hundreds or thousands ofeach item is intense. Consider ammo Hoarders like me who have 8k rounds.",
            "Well I'm no expert but with how willing they are to make changes people ask for I'm sure if they can they will",
            "Ehhhh\u2026 It\u2019s simple integer data, not moving code. I have more cosmetics than I have warehouse items at this point\u2026 that is moving code that has to be communicated to all players\u2026 my warehouse items don\u2019t. \n\nOnly 8k? I go through that in a couple days. 100k+ in my warehouse",
            "We have to keep the pressure on for it, and they\u2019ll find a way.",
            "Your warehouse probably needs to be communicated to all players, since you trade from it with no loading screens. Some items also have logic on them such as chests or consumables or quest items.\n\nYour cosmetics inventory likely doesn't need to be communicated to other players, just what you currently have on you, which requires a loading screen to update.",
            "Totally agree, no space and I am having hard time to reclaim my rewards from smugglers pass.",
            "Still, it\u2019s integer data. There\u2019s countless examples of RPGs with warehouses/banks/vaults, that aren\u2019t limited like this and have 5x+ the inventory space. If the pressure stays on for increased space, they\u2019ll figure it out."

            "My top improvement requests as far as customisation goes:\n\n1. Having flags customisable seperately to the sails. They can still use same set of premade colours/patterns/symbols as sails.\n2. Having nameplates display the ship's given name.\n3. More captain faces.\n4. More colour variations of existing costumes and ship ornaments.",

            "Hey Ubi. Loving season 2 so far!\n\nCan we please have better fleet management soon? It is a great new aspect to the game, but the execution could use some work. A separate tab maybe, where we can jump in and edit our ships loadout or cosmetics if we want. It isn\u2019t great to have to completely change ships every time.\n\nIt would also be great if we could have a pirate ledger or something so we could see the breakdown of how our empire is doing. How much Po8 out manufacturers are pulling in, how many mats were making and selling. If we\u2019re in the building-a-pirate-empire game now, let\u2019s lean into it, and let us at least have visuals of the management aspect of it.\n\nLove the game.",
            "Please don't move focus to PvP instead of co-op. By all means add some options but a lot of players play this rather than sea of thieves because they don't want PvP. \n\nAnd please don't tie a load of rewards to it so people feel forced to do stuff they don't enjoy. Give rewards that are available elsewhere in other game modes for solo and co-op players.",
            "For the Future I would like to see Special events where the player is able to take command of a Large Vessel.\nI know currently Large vessel pose difficulty to implement especially as player owned vessels. so this is a chance to Test the Vessels in Player hands without immediatly throwing them in for everyone to use all the time.\n\nThose Events could either be PvE or PvP orientated and should Involve several players.\nAs an Example for a PvE event, it could be a Convoi Going out from Saint Anne to New York to secure Teulings and Scurlocks Trade. Now the Player gets the Ability to steer one of Teulings Cargo Vessels (a Fluyt or Corvette with stronger Weapons than the player can currently have) and try to bring it to safe havens. It should be attractive for other players to Help the Player reach the Destination while plenty of AI ships keep attacking the Player controlled convoi. To further improve teamplay, the Ship should boost combat ability as Long as they sail in Formation which adds more depth to the current PvE gameplay.\n\nthis way it would be a Teaser for the future and a way to test around and gather feedback about Large ships.",
            "Hey Devs, feedback for right now is that keep continuing the amazing work you do and we appreciate you guys! The only thing we\u2019re having issue with rn is like I asked/commented yesterday in the stream that the bounty timers are currently not resetting every 30 minutes and the Mega Lestari is currently not giving out chest after you did the bounty already once. It will only give out 10k silver rn! So if you guys please fix that asap it would be AMAZING! Also I LOVE THE FAST TRAVELLING TO EVENTS \ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f.",
            "A group finder for several activities (fort, season boss, bounty, \u2026) would be nice. I had it many times that you take a season boss bounty but if you are unlucky no one on your server want to do it. \n\nThe chat function is flooded with the \u201enot all players may have the chat enabled\u201c error and it is in general very inactive. \n\nMore customisation for the captains (faces, beards, faces, full body tattoo) would be nice.\n\nThe fleet management is too clunky. I need equipment management available for all ships without changing the ship. Also it is annoying that I see all ships asigned to manufactories in the change ship screen. I cant equip them so dont show them please. Would make the screen more clean. \n\nSmall ships need a buff in some way. They still feel too weak in comparison to the greater ships. \n\nThe upgrade costs are a bit too high in my opinion. \n\nCulverins need a buff. Actualy they are not realy viable. \n\nIn general I have to say thanks for the great game so far. I love it. Keep up the good work <3\n\n___________\nedit: typos",

            "1. Remove the Dhow as a ship that gets changed into and instead, make it a ship that every ship can dock and deploy into the small rivers and channels to get your hunting done.\n\n2. Create a quest for Kingpins to be able to increase their inventory to at least 50 more warehouse spaces. Why so many more items were added to the game without this being implemented already seems like a huge oversight to me and needs to be added to the game asap. \n\nThese are the two most immediate QoL changes that I believe would greatly improve things.",
            "If there are still going to be contracts with a 24h cooldown after next week, please set the reset timer for these the same as server reset and not to a 24h reset after player completion. This is really annoying!",
            "For me primairy it's the warehouse that need expanding.\n\nSecond: the map needs to be expanded, in case we don't get new and more events or things to do.  \nI mean not only a new bounty or convoy. But something new. New factions would be a good start.\n\nSome idea's: get a HQ that you can decorate your self, (like we can already do with the ship)\nAnd be able to craft stuff for the hq like we already can for some materials.  \nIn this way, we can also use the lesser materials again.  \nYou could have a bar in it, and stock your wine/gin etc in it to make profit (silver). (more than you get by selling it )\n\nA new legendary captain(s) like black beard or so in the game to get missions from would be a fun idea imo.\n\nAnd again, large ships or more different ships would be great.\n\nAnother idea is to have group events that would be longer, meaning not only killing the boss, but after killing him, you need to go to another point with another objective, idk.  \nSo that you get the feeling you are having an adventure/story in the mission.\n\nAnd cutscenes would be great, just a bit more story in the events after you turn the mission in.\n\nLast idea, mega events, that needs a minimum of players (like 7/8) before getting started\n\nPs: whats the deal with the kingpin\u2019s rewards when leveling? We just can\u2019t use this anymore\u2026 first we were glad to receive them, but now that we have better gear it is just crap.",
            "Customization: Female captains need to have an option for the under-shirt (brownish wrap thing),  because right now it clashes with so many neat designs you folks have. If we can get say, a black one, a cleaner white one, or something thinner with a different design, it would help out a lot. It\u2019s always visible right now and looks odd. \n\nPVE Events: I would like to see an event where players can Escort a friendly convoy. Doesn\u2019t have to be across the map, but we are helping out either Helm or generic merchants who hire as body guards. Gives people a reason to tank or heal a bit more. Can flavor it at as a faction and their rival even to keep it fresh (Sea People convoy and the Fara, for example.)\n\nA bit fantastical, another one would be a Siege event, but for a floating Rogue fort (or oil rig kind of thing). Four different variations (flame towers, torpedo bays, etc.) for the respective factions, it would be a multi-stage event. Kill off a wave or two of ships guarding the floating fort, break through its turrets and walls, and then fend off reinforcements. Rewards would be more Po8 / manufactory supplies, and themed cosmetics (faction flag logo?). I would like to see this one because we can go to waters and areas that aren\u2019t just stuck to land. SE on the map, NW within that empty space above the helm roaming supply mission, etc. \n\nA Blockade/Gauntlet using rivers would be neat, too. This would be like a short dungeon in an MMO, and be for 1-3 people like how the blue Heists are coded for allowing people to join. Basically you are going from point A to B, but knocking out hard checkpoints of mine fields, hastily constructed towers (riverbank shipwrecks being repurposed :)), makeshift barriers, and grouped ships (kamikaze ones too) clogging the path. There\u2019s probably 3-4 lanes/places in Africa Coast, 1-2 in Red Isle, and 2-3 places in the Indies where this would be doable. MAYBE have a Small-ship only requirement (reason to upgrade them), or if Medium is allowed, then they can get larger channels of water (bottom SW of the map near the fort for example). Variety in what we do and where we do it is important. Plus gives smaller Factions a bit more creativity. (Ungwana fire mines, Rempah rocket towers, etc.)\n\nBalancing: I would like the team to take a look at the debuffs and ways to make them stand out a bit more. Like in Guild Wars 2, there was an issue of classes that used DoTs (Fire, Flooding) being shared or overwritten by other people. I can understand if the Boarding health is shared, but for Muskets/Firebombs, if we can make that player-dependent (Ablaze / Flooding / Torn Sails effect, too.) I understand it\u2019s nice to work as a team and debuff a boss, but sometimes a Crew Charge can go to waste, or not everyone can get their Musket/Firebomb attack (even if they built for it.) \n\nOn that note, I would suggest having Ablaze and Flooding be the same damage, but separate debuffs. Flooding is neat with its speed debuff, maybe Ablaze can affect cannon reload speed or bombard/rocket accuracy? Give some breathing room for players when going up against a boss with both debuffs on.\n\nPlease also take a look at Torpedos (for PVE anyways.) I tried to build for them, even using the new homing torpedos for a broadside and as much furniture as I could. They still don\u2019t have enough oomph, especially when they have trouble getting critical hits as easily as cannons.\nTwo suggestions I have is base projectile speed being faster, and having Rahma\u2019s torpedo weapon perk being across the board. Rewarding players with hitting all 2-4 torpedoes without upping the base damage could help out. \n\nThat\u2019s it for now. Love the game, excited for the future.",

perhaps at a small loss of stats(since Sovereigns are obviously much harder to come by and should still be required for the creme de la creme), could also work. \n\n**Enemy Mortar** - Add a deadzone for these as a way to be able to use other tactics around them instead of just stacking damage mitigation(looking at you, Opwelling)\n\n**Buying Ammunition** - this is a small one but as someone who religiously purchases ammo, please add a tooltip similar to other items, displaying our current stock on/off ship.\n\n**Crafting Ammunition** - Please let us use various cloth/metals/wood as substitutes for wreckage scraps in crafting ammunition, it doesn't need to come with a new league of colored ammo, but just allow multiple ways of gathering materials for this process.\n\n**Stamina Food** - Decrease the cooldown of improved stamina food to the same 15 seconds as regular food, why should my Tylosaurus Steaks essentially be useless when they are much, much harder to come by?\n\n**More Food Recipes** - Add more recipes for buff food, the +reload on the Zong Zi was a wonderful idea, but why not expand this to turn speed, damage/weakpoint damage, acceleration/deceleration, status effect recovery and others for further customization and specialization of stats.\n\nTime for a couple of potentially unpopular opinions..\n\n**The Holy Trifecta of Enchanced/Regular Repair Kit I, Damage Mitigation and Rigging Stations** - Increase the cooldown or reduce effectiveness of Kit 1s as they, in partnership with general damage mitigation, and items like Black Prince and Rigging Station make pvp kills borderline impossible when encountering that combination used by any pirate able to tell his bow from his stern.\n\nOr\n\nPerhaps reducing effectiveness of overall damage mitigation vs other players alone could be a potential solution to this, as it works fine for PvE situations where you are still able to actually get blown up.\n\n**Brigantine Level 6 Ram perk** - Change this to something else, the only current use of ramming(which works outside of this particular perk anyway) is flooding, the damage increase is negligible at best, and at worst will never even be a factor since ramming anyone but a boss or idle NPC is not worth the maneuvering(read: temporary loss of other damage sources) to achieve.\n\nTo add to this, you seem insistant on bringing small ships up to a medium playing field and in all honesty, unless you're the aquatic version of Lewis Hamilton you're never, ever going to be ramming one of those mosquitoes in a Brigantine. \n\nOnto the last, and probably most unpopular opinion as an extension to the paragraph above:\n\n**Small Ships And Their Purpose** - Increase the support factor and severely decrease their damage output, or increase the effectiveness of damage they sustain, yes, I said it.\n\nThe only end result in sight for this is medium ships becoming obsolete and starter ships taking over the ocean. \n\nYeah, sure, they should be more maneuverable/agile but could instead of damage boosts easily fill the current support void, which would still make them desirable partners/additions, but let's not kid ourselves into thinking these should ever be on par with the damage output or tanking capabilities of a medium counterpart - this goes for large vs. medium as well, especially since you have to be right next to them in order to even land a full broadside whereas they do not.\n\nEdit to add: I enjoy this game throughly and appreciate the support and attentiveness you have been giving the community, season 2 has been a major step up and most content now feels rewarding and worthy of attention, there is not an event or mission or call for help that feels redundant.\n\nSo thank you for a great game, a great job and all the best from here.",

            "LARGE SHIPS: \nCan be added as player ships with the rumored map expansions (a great idea, especially with bigger open seas). Technically, we already had a large ship in the game, the Exeter, that belonged to Scurlock at the very beginning tutorial of the game, so the models could work.\nBuilding something like this as a mode of transportation between the Indian ocean and future expansions or to reclaim lost empires (ie: The Caribbean).\n\n\nARMOR TRANSMOG:\nAdd the ability to either hide or change armor coloring ourselves because the majority of the best armor doesn't match with hull colors without looking really weird.\n\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE FLAGS:\nThe ability to customize our flags separate from the sails seems like a must. Historically, pirates created their own flag as a means to identify themselves to each other and their enemies, this doesn't need a whole re-work we can use the same colors that are given to the sails as well as the symbols and patterns just to make our ships truly our own.\n\n\nMAP EXPANSIONS:\nThe setting of the Indian ocean was a great idea. It's something fresh and largely unknown to history. However, it is somewhat limiting to the game as a whole. The pirate empire stretched into all oceans all across the world, chiefist among them was the Caribbean. I feel that it would entice new players to join the fold if there were new maps and newer opportunities.\nWith an expansion to the Caribbean, you could introduce the British and the Spanish as the enemy factions of the area with Nassau and Havana as the pirate dens and put in new larger ships as a means to combat the insane firepower of the British and Spanish fleets (ie: Frigate, Galleon, Man 'O War)\n\n\nBRAND COLLABS:\nLike with the new Hellfest set, you could collab with other brands. I'd personally love to see an Assassin's Creed Black Flag collab with Captain and ship cosmetics or a Pirates of the Caribbean collab with ship cosmetics as well as a Captain Jack Sparrow outfit or a Barbosa outfit (maybe even his commodore outfit).\n\n\nLONGER SHIP NAMES:\nThe current character limit for ship names is 15 including spaces and punctuation. I'd like to recommend an increase to 24 just to give that extra amount of customization people want.\n\n\nUPGRADABLE WEAPONS:\nThe ability to upgrade weapons like ships would be a smart idea.\n\n\nLONG GUN VERSATILITY:\nI can't be the only one who wants long guns to be equipable on all decks right? Feature can be reserved for large ships just like the auxiliary weapons are for medium.\n\n\nHELM SHIP SET:\nI'd love to get my hands on a set with a figurehead, decorations, hull color, sail color and wheel for a helm theme. (Could also be a Captain outfit)\n\n\nCAPTAIN'S CABIN:\nWould be cool for cosmetic purposes, but also to use the helm empire table from the ship rather than having to dock at St.Anne or Telok every time. Which could open us up to being able to wander around our ship too.",

As an Early Access Beta and consistent daily pirate of 1000+ hours, I can officially claim Season 2 is a HUGE breath of fresh air for me. I\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve been a bit critical, but it\u2019s only because I love this game and want to see it continuously improving. They, have, done, that (so far)! \ud83e\udd1d \n\nIntroduction over, now some feedback. \n\n\u2022Fast Travel on Help Request: A++(BUT)\n\u2014-*BUT* why did you remove our ability to call for help prior to event engagement? You gave us one great feature, but removed another. -don\u2019t like that!- The help feature we had prior to engagement was a huge help to gather together first, and see if anyone was going to show up. That\u2019s been taken from us. Now I have to start and event, call for help, still have to hope people show up\u2026 but if they don\u2019t show, I\u2019m screwed and have to try to evade and leave the event. That\u2019s not fun, and it\u2019s not a quality of life improvement. Is it not possible to have both? \n\n\u2022Ship Upgrades: B+\n\u2014-This was a much needed addition. Absolutely love this. However the prices are a bit steep, and where do I get more upgrade parts? This game is very much *not* for casual players. I have no issues getting these materials, but I\u2019ve grinded much more than most, and all my friends are struggling to enjoy this content. It\u2019s just not enjoyable for most casual players. Would like to see the prices and materials adjusted down some, and give us more events to earn upgrade parts. I can\u2019t even touch small ship upgrades yet, and I\u2019d love to push into that a little. 2000 helm materials for 1 part is way too steep. 500 would be fair! \n\n\u2022Fleet Management: A++++++++++~\n\u2014-This wholeheartedly has to be the single most QOL improvement in this game. It also adds a whole new puzzle to maximize efficiency with. I enjoy it! The only feedback I have here is the ship levels for Low-Risk deliveries need a net reduction by 1 level (at level 10 factories). Seems a bit silly to require level 14 ships for some factories when we can\u2019t even achieve that. Maybe that was intended? -if so\u2026 seriously? Maybe add Helm Upgrade pages to lower ship level requirements and maybe even reduce the travel time for ship? That\u2019d be cool.\n\n\u2022Cosmetics: B\n\u2014-Quite a few of the cosmetics, ship and captain, have been leaving a lot to be desired on the \u201crealism\u201d side. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I enjoy the bright emissive, sometimes flamboyant, and pastel colors\u2026 BUT let\u2019s not make those the majority please? Can we get a better mix of more realistic options without all the flare? I actually thought a steampunk theme would look pretty awesome with all the wood we have to work with in the art department. \n\n\u2022Notifications: C-\n\u2014-Notifications were an F in season 1, so you\u2019ve definitely made some much needed improvements. There\u2019s a lot to do here still considering this is becoming such a group focused RPG. Can we have a log to track these things instead of a temporary pop-up? I can\u2019t immediately address a pop-up when I\u2019m a high seas pirate in the middle of battle! I need to follow up on these things after a few minutes. Also, why can\u2019t I see everything on the map? I miss a lot of calls for help and events depending on where I\u2019m at. -don\u2019t like that!- Also, can we get some type of dialogue when a person responds to our help request, can we see from the map view how many people are currently engaged in the event? Maybe there\u2019s 13 people and I don\u2019t need to show up, or maybe I do need to help the guy trying to do it solo. I need to know if I can continue farming the rubber I need or stop what I\u2019m doing to go help. I know I\u2019m asking a lot here, but these are some ideas to REALLY improve this and add huge QOL. \n\n\u2022PVP: F\n\u2014-I have no desire to PvP until we stop losing items that we need to recover upon death. Not even going to discuss the imbalances in PvP until that\u2019s fixed. When I sink, my sole priority is retreat OR recover loot BEFORE I can start PvPing again. All my food and items are there, and you\u2019ve made my enjoyment of PvP go from fun battles yay! to a massively irritating recovery mission. -don\u2019t like that!- there\u2019s really no purpose for this!

            "Ahoy, mateys!\n\nFirst of all, while it may not be what many expected, but as a (pre-Steam release) Windward fan, this game really struck a nerve for me and I absolutely love it! Season 2 is a lot of fun and even got 2 of my friends back into the game! Teleporting to events is a true game-changer. Here are some things that I'd like to see improved in the future, in order of how quickly I think they might be realistically doable:\n\n1. Layering of icons on the map  \nThis is mostly about the fast travel icon. 2 annoying situations occur a lot:   \n\u30fbMe and my friend want to fast travel somewhere. The first person goes, the second person cannot click the icon anymore because the other person's ship plops up right on top of it.  \n\u30fbI'm in a buyout. I want to quick travel to the location, but end up leaving the buyout instead, because that icon was on top. That's obviously not what I wanted.\n\n2. More Sovereigns/Diamond Tiers  \nThis season I have reached Diamond pretty early. Now I can hardly get any new Sovereigns, but there are still many things I want to buy with them! Especially cosmetics, which I put on the backburner to get the important equipment first. Why not add Diamond I-III like for the other ranks to give late-game players some more things to work toward? Could be really high target numbers, too, like 1\\~5 million Po8.\n\n3. Separate inventory for ship equipment (weapons, armor and furniture)  \nI think it would be better for overview if these were stored separately like vanity items. Might be awkward because they can be traded, but I'd like to at least put the thought out for discussion.\n\n4. Regarding the chest with items from previous seasons  \nLove the concept, but for the love of god, remove the low tier items from there... For the future, I think it would be cool to have one chest from each season (maybe with an aptly themed design), so that especially players who come to the game later can target specific season items.\n\n5. Being able to hire Crew/Officers  \nAs a long-term goal, I'd love it if we could hire special crewmembers that give bonuses to our ships. There used to be this game (only by name affiliated with the franchise) 20 years ago, where you could do that: [Pirates of the Caribbean (video game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_(video_game))   \nBasically, meeting people in outposts, talking to them, and having the option to hire them (and then have them kind of like an equipment. (Our current first mate could be the \"starter crewmember!\")   \nWould also be great for story tie-ins.\n\n6. Our own island  \nI want a customizable pirate lair on my own island! :D Also long term, but that would be so awesome. Seeing my own ships anchored, having my pets and crew stroll around, visit my friends islands and have them visit mine, etc.\n\n7. Fighting on land  \nSuper long term, obviously, as this would basically be putting in an entire new game in the game, but eventually being able to swashbuckle would be perfect.",
            "Mega Lestari needs a slightly longer and more visible disturbance under the ship being targeted by its underwater bite.

            "The things that bring me back to the game are not the need to grind materials, but rather the interest in new ships, new weapons, and new modes of play.\n\nNew weapons:  some ideas would be a fairly standard loadout choice of cannonball, heated ball, chain shot, grenade shot, rather than wholly different weapons.  Mortars that spread sea fire (not just ablaze dot but actual fire on the surface), harpoons, smokescreens\n\nNew ships:  larger ships, galleons, clippers, \u201cpets\u201d (AI ships that follow and fight to create actual fleets), man o war.\n\nNew game modes:  land attacks on forts, fleet based play w pets, boarding, landing parties (marines) with objectives.\n\nOther randomness:  \n- Actual sailing would be great, no direct upwind sailing and no guarantee of wind at all.  Different ships should have different capabilities for close hauling, which would add a fun variable to ship choice.  Do you take the ship that can hit hard but barely crawl upwind?  Or the lighter ship that flies close hauled but has less iron?  Obviously needs to be balanced to be fun, but temporary lulls and the need to actually tack your way to a destination would be welcome!  For lulls, having gameplay to tow ship w/longboars and oars at a crawl\n\n- Objective UI needs to be separated from map.  Two clicks every time I want to see my quests is annoying.\n\n- In general ships feel very flimsy.  Real ships would pound for a long time before damaging another ship enough to sink it.  I\u2019d love to see ships become significantly stronger and longer lasting.  And spawn many fewer ships as well to balance the extended time sink.\n\n- The spawn rate on Chrous ships is out of control- literally can\u2019t stop to breathe as they spawn instantly when one is destroyed.\n\nFinally, I just want to say I think this game is gorgeous, so well done art team.",

            "I miss how immersive the early game was and I'm sort of getting bored of feeling pushed towards FT-ing everywhere in the late game. Crossing the ocean the first time was really memorable, but there's basically no reason to do it anymore.\n\nThe new teleport function made the late game much more accessible for me, but also meaningless. I've \"killed\" Hubac and Le Peste a bunch of times, but each time I've just ported into a 10-man where they brute force them down. They look like interesting and complex bosses with stages, but I wouldn't know because all I have to do is spam it, it lasts a minute anyway. \n\nSome ideas:\n\n- Make coop meaningful in the helm, like the businesses in GTA and RDR2 Online. 3-player fortress attacks, but the fortress has two stages that are weak to different types of damage. Transport mission but have one of the players control a galleon that only has healing cannons. Have a PotC-style heist: two players lay siege on a fortress to draw the Dauntless and the third guy on a Dhow sneaks in and steals the Interceptor. Even simple \"deliver these 3 shipments to 3 different places simultaneously\" missions like in GTAO would do a lot to make coop feel more meaningful.\n\n- Replace helm production cost upgrades with logistic or military missions, either clear out an area of a particular type of enemy; or have me transports alembics to a few manufactories without FT-ing. Bonus points for not damaging your ship while crossing the ocean. Or for arriving really fast, or dealing with enemies on the way, etc. Smuggler missions provide temporary boosts to helm trade missions, etc.\n\n- Make Helm progression benefit from the immersive but low level repeatable missions that nobody does. What if they upgraded manufactories? 10 apex crocodile skins instead of (or in addition to) 1k po8. More creative ones would be great but anything that actually makes us play in the game would be an improvement, especially if there are several missions around an area and they don't encourage FT-ing all over the map.",

To distinguish them further from demi-cannons, change the firing profile from all guns in unison to a rapid side-to-side sequential broadside. Maybe a weapon type for Large+ ships?\n   * Battering Ram - Melee-focused weapon, bow-only. Gives passive ramming bonuses. Either fully passive or active, where \"firing\" the weapon timed with ramming the opponent gives additional bonus damage or status.\n   * Chaser Gun - Another bow/stern-only weapon. Think like, the triple-barrelled rotary cannon of Davy Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean. Either fast firing-rate per volley/reload or constant, slower firing-rate without reload. Balance-wise, maybe slows down the ship while firing. Maybe Large+ only?\n* **Furniture**\n   * Furniture that gives long guns a way to scope in.\n   * Furniture that increases cargo-hold; for those farming runs. Although unequipping it with full cargo-hold and full warehouse needs to be prevented.\n* **Ship Management**\n   * A way to save and switch between ship builds and apply them to multiple ships when kitting out your fleet.\n   * The same but just for ship cosmetics, so we can apply a look to all our fleet.\n* **Helm Management**\n   * Sort of a quality of life, but a way to access both your distillery and lab from your helm/hideout.\n   * Additional upgrades; hire more workers, extend your distillery/lab, more parallel worker slots. Maybe also some larger/permanent upgrades that add a visual change to the hideout.\n   * Hideout customization; I'm sure it's coming but I'm listing it anyway.\n   * Currently, it's more efficient to just sell your Gold Skull Rum for silver to keep the manufactories running. Maybe this needs to be addressed in a way, give us alternatives to make silver or more incentives to spend the products on other things.\n   * Related to the last point, make Helm Deliveries meaningful, they're underutilized. Give them a significant boost.\n* **Quality of Life**\n   * An ability to fast-travel to your friends/group/clan members as long as they are out of combat.\n* **Miscellaneous**\n   * Go full on One Piece with the villain/antagonist designs; The Hubac twins are a good start. Be creative and get crazy with them!\n   * This seems like a nitpick but can we have an improved treasure-digging animation? The current one seems like an obvious place-holder.

Limited to lumberyards and foundries only to keep it fair, and i\u2019m thinking the hourly amount similar to that of what we can originally buy from them every hour, but it would be nice if that loot is autocollected with the fleet transporting po8, whilst on the others they produce more on top until it reaches a limit before it has to be collected to make more.

However, the scope of the headwind is sometimes as far as east to west-northwest, nearly 180 degrees. It\u2019s almost like you cannot maneuver out of it. Just some minor adjustments to the parameters of the headwind\u2019s scope of action would make a significant difference in the enjoyment of the game. \n\nSecondly, the drop rates for each season\u2019s furnitures and weapons seems to be extremely skewed.

My wife and I both play for lots of hours each week, and neither of us has received even close to a quarter of the furniture currently offered in season 2.  I chose to post this point here because one of the bigger S&B communities on Facebook, consisting of thousands of members, has this point as a gripe post almost weekly.  There seems to be an issue with drop rates on items each season when defeating bosses repeatedly.  \n\nIn conclusion, these are my only two gripes with the entire game.

            "From an MMO player:  \n1. instanced event (dungoen)- in Skull and bones it would look like this: an instance event for a group of players that are matchmade or a premade group, create an event mostly in rivers basicly the idea is that a group fights through a liner based path through stronger type enemies with different abilies and weapons than the usual enemies have, after reaching a manufactory they need to plunder it, but it will be more advanced and it will require to capture and hold certain areas for the plunder to finish whilst defending againts elite enemies. I believe this wouldnt be hard to implement as the world is created it would only need to be instanced and sharded. Rewards should be similar like bosses and event drop.  \n2. Another instance event in the open seas, again players (5 players) are matchmade and they are in a different instance than the rest of the server, event would be a reversed type convoy where the players defend a convoy, but hordes of enemies attack. Reward should be based on how far and many convoy ships survived.\n\n3. Mega instance event for 10 players siege of saint anne or telok, the idea of this would be to hold those cities from the attack waves whilst doing certain objective around the city for example capture close by towns or other POI locations. This event should have rewards from both current and previous season, and it would be a great addition for farming items from past content.\n\n  \nFrom a solo player:  \n1. there needs to be a place were a casual person can get previous season items and items from group content, i do believe we need to have something similar to a gamble mechanic in game, but it should not be based on PO8, i think it should be based on a random quest from the campaign or even a regata race, that a player can do daily and get 1 random item from a previous season.\n\n2. instance event for a solo person - basicly the idea of the current manufactory defense is good, but its very borring we need to get more objectives in there and not just waves of enemies, also the reward should be increased currently i dont even bother with defense as waiting previous 13 hours or the current 4 hours is not a problem. I think the reward for this kind of event should be something what a solo player cant obtain with other means.\n\n  \nFrom a PVP player:\n\n1. The 5v5 that is coming in season3 sound promising, but my expectations are low, as i understand a good pvp event for 10 people would be something similar to attack and defend but not based on hp bar where the players can just focus fire the objective, but should be based on something like capture points or even payload.

            "I've post some feedback a few days ago here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SkullAndBonesGame/s/f7qHgum8x8",
            "I'd like to see a ship that uses Brig/Sambuk body, but has another sail plan. Ideally one that has a longer bowsprit like the Brigantine and equal amount of sails on both masts like the Snow. \n\nSambuk's sails seem too small for its body and Brig's front mast having 3 sails while the rear only has 2 looks rather ugly. I don't think there's any historical example of such layout.",
            "Hi Devs: \nLoving Season 2 so far!\nI may post multiple replies, but this will be to address the Manufactories and Assigning ships for deliveries. Can you look at, and please balance the ship levels required to perform deliveries? At level 10, there are factories that are medium risk for level 13 ships. Was this intended? I surely hope not. Maybe have a net rebalance of reducing all ship level requirements by 1 level to balance out the whole map? I did not find it enjoyable to realize I had to completely rebuild my fleet as I leveled up my factories.\n\nKeep up the great work! Hoping to see some reduced level adjustments to this feature in the future.",

For example fishing, mining, gathering, hunting, cooking etc.\n\nThe world of Skull and Bones is fun to be in and just explore and I think it would benefit to have a skill tree to reward exploring.  I think this would really balance out the wait times for current events too.  While you are waiting you have something to work on and level up.",
            "I really appreciate you guys coming here to ask, that\u2019s awesome. Before more content, maybe some time could be spent fixing some of the issues. Since the Monday update I can\u2019t get the chat to work, nor can I figure out how to call for help at a mission. On Xbox at least, it\u2019s not possible for me to play more than 2.5 hours without the game freezing, or costing me out of it. This is never consistent, maybe sailing, returning to port, in the middle of a mission, or connecting 8\u2019s. I also have been trying to get Damai since start of the season, and I haven\u2019t seen it come up one time. It\u2019s the last manufacturer I need. Thanks for trying to make the game even better, even with the issues I still have fun, but it\u2019s tough to convince people to get on and play with me due to them. I\u2019m rooting for you all!",

You can then craft any dish available to you given your ingredient types, but these expire after 2 or 3 hours. Each hippo would be +4h. Lestari would be an instant +24h. You'd buy access to beef or flour for a few hours, instead of just keeping a bunch in the warehouse. \n\nBananas, coconuts, etc; should add to the available ingredient types you carry, but after that they should just become a \"grilled staple\", with maybe some buffs based on the other ingredients currently available in your cauldron.
