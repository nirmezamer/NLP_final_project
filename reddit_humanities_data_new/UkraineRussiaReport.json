But in one of their recent publications, they veered into complete science fiction [suggesting that Russia honest-to-goodness cracked 256-bit AES](https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/special-resources/meatgrinder-russian-tactics-second-year-its-invasion-ukraine) encryption. This is as preposterous as someone claiming they've manufactured a rocket that can carry 10 passengers safely to Mars (with return trip!), for only 1 million dollars.\n\nTo put this into perspective, 256-bit AES is good enough for certain top secret NSA applications ([page 28](https://www.nsa.gov/portals/75/documents/resources/everyone/csfc/capability-packages/WLANCPv2.2_20180626.pdf)). The NSA, even thought they should stop snooping on everything, knows a thing or two about cryptography. Also, 256-bit AES is even resistant against [quantum computers](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/6712/is-aes-256-a-post-quantum-secure-cipher-or-not).\n\nIt's fine that RUSI made a seemingly honest mistake (the preposterous claim came from an interview, so they're merely repeating what someone else said).\n\nThe problem, however, is that this preposterous statement is repeated by other tabloids like the [Wapo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/06/13/war-in-ukraine-so-far-favors-the-defense/b1d70ab8-09a1-11ee-8132-a84600f3bb9b_story.html): Russia is \"achieving real time interception and decryption of Ukrainian Motorola 256-bit encrypted tactical communications systems.\"\n\nThen, yesterday we get some [random youtube video](https://youtu.be/6qhWPuXpdA4?t=423) repeating this same claim.\n\nI love this quote from Michael Crichton:\n\n>You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward\u2014reversing cause and effect. I call these the \"wet streets cause rain\" stories. Paper's full of them.  \n>  \n>In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read.

This should put Isaac Herzog (Current President of Israel) in line for a ICC warrant and heavy sanctions levied against them. \n\nBut will either of those things happen? \n\nAnswer is a resounding nope, as it has been shown the West can illegally invade territory, break international law, commit war crimes, and forces regime changes without having warrants put out by the ICC or hell having the regular soldier be tried for war crimes (such as the widely publicized video known as [Collateral Murder](https://youtu.be/zYTxuW2vmzk?si=9Wn4HNJkj4QQ2BP0) in which US forces in Iraq (2007) fire upon and murder a group of civilians and journalists who they falsely identified as combatants, no war crimes charges were brought against the perpetrators, only charges were against the guy who leaked the video and other documents to WikiLeaks, without those leaks it would have been swept under the rug with the rest of western war crimes).",

            "What I\u2019m interested in after Bakhmut is the future of Russian offensive operations, and how that shapes up for the rest of the Donbas campaign, and their future ambitions into Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkov, or lack thereof. Prigozhin has stated Wagner suffers from serious manpower issues now and might look to reshape itself post-Bakhmut, but I simply don\u2019t trust a single word he says. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Wagner can lick its wounds and replenish numbers off of volunteers due to its impending propaganda victory, but I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m not a general and I\u2019m not a political expert, so I don\u2019t know how this plays out.\n\nLuhansk front will come down to that narrow strip of land that Ukraine still controls, the Svatove-Kreminna axis as I think it\u2019s called. It hasn\u2019t moved a lot but I don\u2019t think either side has put much into it. Securing that axis would theoretically allow Russia to move back into Kharkov oblast but I highly doubly they could afford the manpower to do that after pushing through the Ukrainian fortifications on that axis, that\u2019s my guess at least.\n\nGoing off of that, I need to look at the terrain and fortifications of Zaporizhzhia so if anyone can send that to me I\u2019d appreciate it. Russia\u2019s defensive entrenchments past Dnipro probably suggests they don\u2019t have a ton of ambitions to attack Kherson city any time soon, at least I really wouldn\u2019t understand how that\u2019d work if they were planning an offensive here. Really what I\u2019m getting at is if my pea-brained Redditor mind were to guess, we\u2019re probably getting a \u201cboring\u201d outcome of just rinse and repeat defensive battles in Donetsk oblast where Russia aims to get incremental gains and Ukraine wants to drain Russian manpower. I know boring is quite a bad word in that we shouldn\u2019t think of a horrific war in such terms, rather I\u2019m saying that I think it\u2019s the most likely outcome and not super eventful in regards to the other oblasts. \n\nLast part I\u2019ll have on this is where russia attacks next after Bakhmut. Probably Chasiv Yar shapes up to be a really big deal, russia probably tries their luck again in Vuhledar, Avdiivka becomes a second Bakhmut. My question would be does Russia have enough offense capable units for these battles let alone any that could put pressure on the rest of the front?\n\nJust some random thoughts I had tonight, been away from the war news for a few days. Again I\u2019m not an expert so I probably have some bad tales in here that will age poorly",

            "*The Russia Contingency* podcast featuring Mike Kofman and Rob Lee's\n\n> Russia is defending in a highly competent manner along the front. They were caught completely unprepared during the Kharkiv offensive and learned many lessons from that. Southern lines are entrenched at the divisional and even combined arms army level. \n\n\n\n>They're fighting according to doctrine (multiple layers of minefields and trenches, presighted artillery, frontline troops have lots of AT weapons, semi-regular counterattacks, escheloned lines) but employing even more mines than doctrine calls for. They're mixing AT and AP mines, double or even triple stacking AT mines to knock out Ukrainian mine rolling vehicles, and specifically targeting Ukrainian engineering vehicles. They also regularly disperse new mines with their MLRS delivery vehicles, including behind lines Ukrainians have taken, especially roads used to resupply Ukrainian forces. \n\n\n\n> Russia is working hard to mitigate the weaknesses of their lower quality units. They have \"expendable\" troops holding first line trenches and less important areas, bolstered by higher quality units who are holding key parts of the line and used to launch counterattacks. Spetsnaz are being used extensively I'm this role, and are highly effective with ATGMs. By mixing units, lower quality forces are less likely to break. Marine infantry and more highly trained Motorized rifle units are also being used in similar role. \n\n\n\n>The mystery of why Ukraine didn't press Russian forces harder during Kherson withdrawal was answered, it was because Russia used tons of mines there as well. Some of the last equipment that they withdrew were mine-laying MLRS vehicles. \n\n\n\n>Russia is noticeably conserving artillery usage, giving Ukraine a relative but not decisive advantage in tube artillery. Russia still has an advantage in MLRS though Ukraine likely has an advantage in PGMs and long range precision strikes. Kofman stresses that overall Ukrainian fires advantage is *not* decisive and its limited by their supply of munitions from the West. \n\n\n>Ukraine has serious misteps in first days of the offensive, which were costly. Ukraine has a mix of newly raised \"NATO-trained and equipped\" units and more experienced units fighting in the South. The experienced units have taken most of the ground Ukraine has captured thus far. \n\n\n\n>Ukraine's big gamble in this offensive was forming those brand new \"NATO\" brigades. During Russian Winter offensive, Ukraine used highly experienced units like the 93rd Mechanized and 3rd Assault Brigade to hold off the Russian offensive while new brigades were formed. They suffered significant losses and weren't able to rest and refit before this offensive as a result. Unfortunately the newly formed \"NATO\" brigades haven't lived up to expectations and have underperformed thus far. Importantly, the whole units were brand new, including support, artillery, and infantry formations. As such, there's a seeming lack of unit cohesion among these new units and the accelerated training timeline didn't give them enough time to learn capabilities of new equipment or how best to employ them in combined arms operations. \n\n\n\n>The first days of the offensive revealed a number of issues with the new brigades related to reconnaissance of their routes and for their artillery, poor coordination with neighboring units, trouble finding the right targets, problems with engineering, poor coordination with the units whose positions they were taking (i.e. where minefields and terrain features were located), some units got lost at night and others didn't travel down lanes that been cleared of mines. One brigade's advance was apparently delayed by several hours and instead of attacking at night using their superior night fighting capabilities, they attacked at dawn instead. This delay also meant that the Russian units who had been bombarded by Ukrainian artillery were no longer suppressed when they did advance, leading to heavy losses from ATGMs. There was also a lack of a proper \"Plan B\" once they started running into these issues. Most of these problems wouldn't have occurred with more experienced units. \n\n\n> In the first days of the offensive, mines were a problem but the advance was really more blunted by Russian artillery and ATGMs. **The failures of these new units in the first days of the offensive squandered the Ukrainian element of surprise and gave them precious time to react.**\n\n\n\n>Kofman: Ukraine has proven itself highly skilled on the defense, but its struggled offensively the whole war, especially at scaling up operations beyond the company level. This offensive, while using brigades on paper, was handled more as a series of company or reinforced company-level assaults launched largely independent of one another.",

The basis is the economy. The population of Niger has been driven into poverty for a long time.\n> \n> For example, a French company that extracted uranium sold it on the market for $218, while paying Niger only $11 for it. You can work with investors on a 50-50 or 30-70 (%) basis, but it's impossible to give back to the indigenous people of the country, who were born in this country, who live in this country, and who expect that the natural resources of this country belong to them, and according to the Constitution, they belong to them, only 5% of the wealth you receive.\n> \n> To cover up these economic crimes, the country was saturated with a huge number of terrorists. This enormous number of terrorists, theoretically, should have been controlled by a vast number of different troops, financed by the UN, the European Union, Americans, the British, and others. As a result, the population of Niger, which should have been free and happy due to the economic opportunities in their country, was robbed, and to keep them silent, they were kept in fear for decades.\n> \n> To show that these thieves and plunderers are needed in the state's territory, I mean Western countries like France, the USA, and so on, crowds of soldiers were sent there who did nothing but received enormous budgets that were also embezzled at various levels. That's why the transformation in Niger was simply necessary.\n> \n> The power that was in league with Bazoum (ousted president) and his followers, simply covered up, allowing the coalition of people who plundered the nation to be present in Niger's territory. That's it. Therefore, this is a liberation struggle, a liberation movement for the independence of this country, and God grant them success.\"",

Combined with commissions earned from transporting oil on ships linked to Russia, that could add up to $1.2 billion in the three months to July.*\n\n*James Cleverley, British Foreign Secretary, said: \"It is not surprising that Putin is becoming increasingly desperate and dishonest in his attempts to soften the effects of the price cap - something that has severely curtailed Russian revenues since its introduction.\"*\n\n*The price cap, imposed by 67 countries, is designed to keep Russian oil flowing while curtailing revenues that could be used to fund the war.

All I really care about what now beyond where Russia goes next is the casualty figures, simply because Avdiivka, Chasiv Yar, Vuhledar can all become different versions of Bakhmut, and the sustainability of Russian offensives is important. Since Wagner is unlikely to mount an entire full frontal attack(I would rely on Prigozhin\u2019s word that they\u2019re a partially spent force, but I don\u2019t trust anything he says just cause it\u2019s Prigozhin) maybe the propaganda victory causes an influx of volunteers, idk. But costly assaults are going to likely have to be on the part of RAF going forward, that at the very least feels like a safe assumption. \n\nKherson, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkov, nothing changes there. This isn\u2019t a victory that will allow them to be more aggressive there, at least I highly doubt it. But the sentiment seems to be that Bakhmut will become a logistical hub for future campaigns. It\u2019s undeniably a bad defeat for Ukraine which again emphasizes the need to know casualties, if Ukraine was able to make it a cauldron where Russia exhausted offensive potential to take a smaller city, then it starts to sound a lot better. But if casualties were even close to even, it\u2019s bad, Russia/Wagner could\u2019ve even lost a bit more and come out ahead attritional, they can replace their losses easier after all just from having a much larger pool of manpower to draw from. If Russia needs to quietly mobilize/conscript a few tens of thousands they easily can. \n\nIt\u2019s gonna be something that takes a few months to tell. If Russia flounders in the next few months, then we can probably infer that Bakhmut was too costly on offensive capable units.

Aleksandr Dyukov (Chairman of the management Board of Gazprom) however warns that this may help short term, but in the long run it could lead to a fuel shortage.

Looks like interest rates might have to go up again. The central bank rate is currently at ~13%.\n\nHow big of a problem this is really depends on the effect of high interest rates on the economy. Higher interest rates means that companies borrowing money from banks and investors need to provide at least 13% return on investment, otherwise those banks and investors will just keep cash in bank accounts earning the interest.\n\nIs this a problem? Well it depends on how Russias economy works. Most of its gdp comes from large private or state owned enterprises, which in theory should be able to weather this kind of storm. Smaller business will struggle but they account for less of Russia's economic activity.\n\nAnother side of high interest rates are mortgages and property. Higher interest rates makes it harder to afford a loan to buy a house. But I am not aware if housing affordability is much of an issue in Russia to begin with. \n\nFinally, interest rates can only go so high before the financial markets drastically suffer. The reason Russias central bank wont stop is because the alternative (less valuable ruble leading to more inflation) would be far worse.\n\nHigh interest rates affects mostly citygoers and urban population.

            "I would like to suggest that you read the text written by a resident of Ukraine, to some extent this will allow you to understand what is happening:\n\nI live in a country house. It seems that he has not left here since 2014, when he fled from Kyiv from the then first mobilization. How many have there been? In years, nine. Nine years of empty expectations, meaningless hopes. Although what am I talking about? Probably about the fact that everything repeats itself and at some point you begin to feel like a hero of a book you read in childhood.\n\nThere is something symbolic and non-random in this, but in my youth I fell in love with Mikhail Bulgakov's novel The White Guard. When I read this book, I felt like one of those officers who, in the house on Alekseevsky Spusk, drank bitters in the hopeless expectation of changes. Then it seemed to me that all this madness described in the novel had long been left in the past. Kyiv-city was not much different from other cities of the Soviet Union, but Ukraine already existed, it was simply not noticed by many. To understand this, I had to face the Ukrainian intelligentsia of the Zhmerinsky spill, sit with her in the kitchens, listen to what she says, which I did not have time to do due to my age. Now I understand what kind of monster they hatched in their kitchens ...\n\nToday, living in Ukraine is living in exile in one's native land. Around - no one. Talking is dangerous. Maybe the neighbors will not hand over to the special services, but they will definitely make him an enemy of the people. They feel everything - they have a dog's scent. If you say IN Ukraine, they are already looking askance. However, for some, Russian speech and Russian music are enough ... Here you are a stranger, if you do not curse everything Russian, Russian, Putin. And as if on purpose, it was in my presence that some notorious patriots start talking about the \u201cRussian brothers\u201d who came to their land and destroyed the \u201cUkrainian paradise\u201d. And they do not care that Ukraine from the first day of its independent existence was rolling into the abyss, that the economy was consistently destroyed and infrastructure turned into dust. They don't care. They are not to blame. There was an explanation that would write everything off: the Russians came!\n\nThey say nonsense that the people of Ukraine lack information to make their right choice. They have everything. Internet and beyond. In any phone there is an application with a full set of Russian stations. Installed - listen. Do not want. They are not going to. And it's not about fear, but rather about attachment to some incomprehensible substance called Ukraine. Substance, from which they run headlong, but are just as headless tied. Because each of them sees Ukraine the way they want to see it, but not the way it is in reality.\n\nSomehow, in a discussion of one of the articles, I was asked if there are many people in Ukraine with such views (for a united and indivisible Russia)? Then I was silent. I will answer now: units. Remember how in Mark Zakharov's film, Munchausen asked his beloved to tell him something important at parting? She babbled something to him about love, about what would be waiting for him, and he answered: not that! Yes, exactly, it was important for him to hear the words that raw gunpowder was poured into the cannon. This is how we talk about anything, but not about the most important thing.\n\nThe fact is that for the majority of Ukrainian citizens, Russia is already a foreign country. Their capital is Kyiv, not Moscow. And they associate their future with Ukraine, not Russia. And even those refugees from Ukraine, with rare exceptions, feel like a part of Ukraine, and not of Greater Russia from Uzhgorod to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. They are at best pro-Russian, although in essence they are no different from Ukrainian nationalists. They can see this very Ukraine in different ways, but by and large they don\u2019t give a damn about Russia. And today, many of them dream that the Russians will come, hit the Ukrainian nationalists in the hat, they, \u201cpro-Russian\u201d, were brought to power and left alone ... For them, like their opponents, everything that happens to Ukraine is the mistake of certain personalities, but not system flaw of the project itself.\n\nIt is no coincidence that I started this article with Bulgakov, because the pseudo-state entity Ukraine materialized during his lifetime in the form of the Ukrainian Radian Socialist Republic. Under the Soviet regime, the URSR somehow tried to tame, re-educate, but in vain. Whenever the Moscow government weakened control over the territory of the South-Western Territory of Rus', some rustlings came and began to build their own special Ukraine. And they can also be called pro-Russian, because Russians have been systematically eradicated here since 1917. And it is not surprising that there are practically no more of them ...\n\nUkrainian nationalists, for all their madness and demonic possession, are right about one thing - Russia has indeed begun to liquidate the Ukraina project. And for those who have some feelings for the \u201cbrotherly people\u201d, I want to recall the classic plot from American horror films, when the good guys face the evil that came to kill them in the form of their relatives and friends. Exactly the same thing is now faced by Russia in Ukraine - with ALIEN, hidden under the outer shell of the \"fraternal people\". Why did the special operation to denazify and demilitarize Ukraine start so late? Athis is a question for the director of modern history. And this is a question about the fact that in life, as in good dramaturgy, not a single event is possible without the previous one. Otherwise, the whole logic of the story breaks down.\n\nWhen a \u201cUkrainian\u201d talks about something lofty, this does not mean at all that he thinks about something lofty. Quite the opposite. As a rule, his desires are mundane and limited to material goods. Here he is talking about some \"European values\", but, believe me, he does not mean freedom, not democracy, not human rights - he does not give a damn about them. For example, if you ask a \u201cUkrainian\u201d about the meaning of the Maidan, he will certainly launch into lengthy arguments about the \u201cbloody regime\u201d of Viktor Yanukovych. Lying! Try to imagine any Ukrainian revolution without promises of material benefits, which will fall on the heads of \"Ukrainians\" without any effort on their part? Does not work? Me too\u2026\n\nAbsolutely all Ukrainian independence smells not of sweat and blood, not of labor and willpower, but of a piece of bacon with vodka on the table, which the \u201cUkrainians\u201d should bring by the very fact of their existence on Earth. And for the sake of this carefree existence, they are ready to go to any meanness, to humiliate and kill their own fellow citizens, and in fact, a person in himself. And everything that is happening in the South-Western region of Rus' is a clear confirmation of this.\n\nOh, how they do not like the Russian leader in Ukraine and how they curse him! And I'll tell you exactly how. Putin is not loved as God, who looked and looked at the biblical Sodom and Gomorrah, repeatedly warned sinners, sent signs to them, and finally incinerated these cities to hell.\n\n\"Ukrainians\" still do not understand, \"and we are for sho\" arrives! They forgot that the declaration of independence provided for the neutral status of the Ukrainian state with guarantees for the Russian-speaking population of the country! And what did all Ukrainian regimes actually do? Anti-Russian policy?! Rewriting history?! Oppression of the Russian population of the country?! Constant trade wars with Russia?! An attempt to change the neutral status of a state by becoming a member of the EU and NATO?! This is not about 2014, but about the \u201cNATO Membership Action Plan\u201d in 2008\u2026\n\nIt is unprofitable for \u201cUkrainians\u201d today to remember that the 2014 coup d'etat took place under anti-Russian slogans and threats to join the EU with a clear prospect of further entry into NATO. They did not draw any conclusions even when they lost the Crimea. \"Ukrainians\" started a war in Donbass, which went into a frozen phase as a result of the two Minsk agreements. More precisely, two warning blows \"in the teeth.\" Did it teach them something? No!!! They poked Moscow in the United Nations, PACE, CE and other international venues!\n\nOr maybe they thought about Putin's words about the territorial gifts that Ukraine received from the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union? And they also did not hear the statements of the Russian leader that Moscow would not put up with the Ukrainian concept of \u201canti-Russia\u201d. The \"Ukrainians\" were preparing for a victorious march on Moscow, and not only because \"the whole world is with us\", but above all because they did not feel the power of Russia. And if my Ukrainian fellow citizens still don\u2019t understand \u201cfor what Russia attacked them,\u201d then it means that they are terminally ill, they have neither brains nor conscience left. This means that the special operation will continue until the very end of the Ukraina project with the forced seizure of all the \u201cgifts\u201d of Russia, which the Ukrainians could not appreciate. History must make its circle and return to where the mistake was made. The historical mistake is the Ukrainian state itself. Lord, burn!",

            " Since the Time article and the subsequent column in The Economist, the overall discourse on Ukraine has taken an overwhelmingly negative turn.

While I've never shied away from acknowledging Ukraine's flaws and expressing my fair but critical opinions throughout the year, I find myself perplexed by the sudden and widespread shift in sentiment. Is it solely due to the realization that the counteroffensive, has unequivocally failed? Did people really a month ago believe it didn't? Did the acknowledgement from up to, allow now finally for negative discourse in regards for Ukraine?\n\nNow, blame is being cast in all directions\u2014towards the West, the Ukrainian people themselves, and the Ukrainian government.

            "Most of them are broadly pro-Western/pro-US foreign policy agenda. Since the US supports Israel as well as Ukraine, they generally support both.\n\nSomething else to note is that the percentage of Americans that support Russia is relatively small. Plenty are neutral and oppose Ukraine aid, sure, but the number that legitimately believe Russia is the morally correct side in this conflict is only about 2-3%. This contrasts with other conflicts like Israel/Palestine, where a considerable percentage of the US population support Palestine despite US government support for Israel. In my opinion, this is just because Israel/Palestine has been going on for longer and Israel receives less aid than Ukraine currently does. Back in the 1960s and 70s when US aid to Israel first started, pro-Palestinian sentiment was almost non-existent in the US. Moreover, if you look at surveys in places like India, China, the Middle East, Africa, South America, etc., you'll generally see more divided opinions on who's morally right in the Russo-Ukraine conflict. \n\nGenerally, sustained US opposition to a particular nation or group is only going to be ironclad if American troops are in overt conflict with them. You never saw a majority of Americans supporting the Vietcong, for example, no matter how unpopular the Vietnam war got. So unless American troops are ever directly fighting Hamas or Russia, you'll at some point see American citizens supporting their sides in their respective conflicts.",

I find the goals of our support for Ukraine unclear and the bellicose nature of that support unhelpful. I don't think Ukraine can truly win - which is to say, fully defeat Russia and retake Crimea - and we certainly aren't giving them enough support to do that if they even could. So the end goal surely must be to create conditions for a favourable peace - but the support and rhetoric doesn't seem to match that either.\n\nMy worry therefore is that the UK foreign policy is completely one dimensional - let's give Ukraine random support, shout at Russia, and see what happens. Which I find both irresponsible and dangerous, and uncaring of the lives spent in the now seemingly stalemate war. \n\nI am hoping that if and when Ukraine's offensive stalls out, as seems to be happening, both parties can see the fruitlessness of the conflict and peace negotiations can begin in earnest. Unfortunately I worry that Russia will just be emboldened by their successful defence, and seeing their growing air superiority, will launch more attacks.

I have linked below an interview made on the 29th of June by France24 to Rafael Grossi (IAEA General Director) who categorically denies any Russian military activity at the nuclear power plant.\n\n> Ukraine chances of doing anything significant before the upcoming NATO summit is less than 0.

Our teams are there and report everyday.\n\nThis is posted by a neutral user, but it's nothing short of pro-Russian propaganda.

Why would the author of the post need to put the word Russia in quotes when reporting what Ukraine announced? What are they trying to convey? \n\nI'll tell you. They're attempting to discredit Ukraine's claims.\n\nThen there's this sentence:\n\n> I have linked below an interview made on the 29th of June by France24 to Rafael Grossi (IAEA General Director) who categorically denies any Russian military activity at the nuclear power plant.\n\nIt claims that the interviewer denies **any** Russian military activity near the nuclear power plant. \n\nThat is patently false. The plant and its surrounding area are currently occupied by Russian military. If they weren't Ukraine would have taken it over by now.\n\nThe next paragraph is where the propaganda begins to flow freely. First, they claim that Ukraine, who had to deal with the ecological and economical effects of Chernobyl would want a repeat of that, then they claim that Ukraine is a de-facto colony of US. \n\n> Ukraine chances of doing anything significant before the upcoming NATO summit is less than 0. So they are either planning Chernobyl 2.0 and blame it on the Russians or they want to celebrate the 4th of July with the biggest of all booms as Ukraine is de facto a future American colony courtesy of Blackrock.\n\nThis claim of Ukraine can't be an independent country and therefore must be a colony of Russia or US is a tired trope in Russian propaganda. \n\nThe next paragraph after that is using  IAEA  nuclear experts as a source of truth about things they're not experts in. \n\n> IAEA saw no evidence Moscow planning attack on Zaporizhia nuclear plant, but 'anything can happen at around min 5\n\nIAEA are not counterintelligence experts.

            "*I got this from a Korean analyst's commentary, it's not mine - the analyst was responding to Claims of China being miffed at the Russia - North Korea rapprochement .*\n\n*Part1* \n\n*Quote:* \n\n*You know as a professional analyst specialising in the DPRK.  Been doing it for 40 years now. Some of the things you got right, but you're still looking through Western eyes, so you miss some nuances. You get it much better than most amateurs, but there's more to it.*  \n  \n*They share a border with Russia, embrace the Juche philosophy, and follow old-style communism. Their equipment might look like crap to us, but it's designed as part of an overall structure. They control everything from mining materials to weapon production, using old designs that don't require imported materials. They've been sanctioned so long they've made their society self-sufficient and self reliant. That's the basic Juche philosophy in a nutshell. They actively don't want trade because that trade makes them dependent on others.*  \n  \n*They know we think their weapons are bad, but they see our weapons as equally unsuitable for their strategy. Their weapons are designed for immediate activation, mobilising the entire population for war. Everyone in their 25 million population is part of the military and government, working together to produce what\u2019s needed. They don't think of those things as being separate. To be a citizen, you are part of the government and military. They are all one thing. They have a system where labour is free because it earns social credit, which is essential for purchasing anything in the DPRK. Without social credit, money is useless.*  \n  \n*Since they never westernized like Russia, nothing was privatized, and their production facilities remain fully intact. If the go button is pressed, they can produce millions of rounds per month. Their entire nation is built to outproduce the rest of the world (excluding China and Russia) in wartime, which is why they structured their society this way.*  \n  \n*They can rival modern Russia in arms production because that's their system's advantage. Their population sits in factories, ready to start producing weapons and ammunition from the moment they\u2019re needed.  If they get jobs to make other things they will do it but if they get no jobs, they sit there doing nothing just in case they get the order to make shells.*  \n  \n*The deals they're doing with Russia aren't about what Russia will give them. They'd give Russia anything for free if asked. (that's a much bigger discussion on multi polarity of the 1950's and China's betrayal from their eyes (joining the US side in the Sino-Soviet split plus \"abandoning\" them in the Korean war) and Russia coming to their aid with nothing asked for in return. What Russia provides them simply changes what they mass-produce. for example, If Russia gives them T-14 design plans and they can manufacture them with their resources, they'll produce them. If Russia limits them to T-50s, then that's what they'll produce. That's their mindset.  They don't ask Russia for anything (it would not escalate Un as a great leader) but will take anything Russia gives them.*   \n  \n*Always remember, they're old 1950s Russian communists who believe in Stalin's saying, \"Quantity has a quality all its own.\" They think a thousand low-quality rounds today are better than one high-quality round tomorrow, and the same goes for tanks and everything else they make.*  \n  \n*Also, keep in mind the DPRK hasn't mobilised for war production yet. What they're giving Russia now are just spares. Their philosophy is that when the UN and US decide to invade them again, they'll throw everything from stores into battle from day one and keep building 24/7 to swarm their enemies. Think of Russia in the 1940s during WWII to understand their mindset. They have stayed prepared to do this since the 1950's. They have starved millions and had millions die from other things just so they can be sovereign, independent and fully self reliant. The only thing they desperately crave from anyone outside of the DPRK is respect - earned by helping them.*  \n  \n*This is what motivates the DPRK: No other great leader has been able to pay back the honour debt to Russia for coming to their rescue in the Korean war - from their perspective unasked and unexpected. When Russia could have let them die or demand restrictive things that would have put them in debt for years, they didn't.* \n\n*No great leader has been able to pay back this honour debt because Russia has never needed anyone else - until now.  For Un to get back to equality - to be able to stand next to Putin as an equal in DPRK eyes and give them unwavering support, without question, without expectation and without payment required does something that no other Korean leader has ever been able to do. It escalates Un to be the greatest of the great leaders.  Right now, he isn't even a great leader, just the leader.*",
            "They can, say, open cruise missiles production. And share finnished goods. Some will go for Russia, some for NK. Just some thoughts.",
            "Different weapons, and they can also share their designs.",
            "*Part 2:*\n\n*That's why payment is kind of shunned by the DPRK - and why they will quickly and easily activate everyone - and I do mean everyone - if Russia asks.  But here's the catch. Russia HAS to ask because giving to them if they don't ask for help is also an insult to Russia - so the DPRK will sit there doing nothing until Russia asks.*  \n  \n*As to why did Un train into Russia? - old style communist and all of their leaders would have done the same. No aircraft.  But Putin took an aircraft into Pyongyang and they didn't say a thing.  That's how much they feel the honour debt with Russia.  They don't feel it with China because they feel that China is their pole leader and their pole leader didn't die to help them reunify the south and didn't support them when they thought they were going to lose it all - there is still anger there.  But the fact that Russia, the head of the European (not Asian) pole did what it did has never been forgotten.*  \n  \n*(also calling them \"North Koreans\"  is a massive insult to them because it implies acceptance of a south Korea - a nation that they do not recognise and consider a US/UN occupied part of their nation)  When you said \"big boss little subordinate\" - thats one thing they would never accept - they demand being treated as an equal.* \n\n *Truth is, CHina and Russia know it. The DPRK know that China is their pole leader, Russia is the European pole leader but they have not forgiven China for it's failure during the Korean war to live up to their title as pole leader and have not forgotten Russia stepping in when it was unexpected.  The DPRK have zero fear of China - due to their brainwashing and indoctrination. \"*\n\n*End Quote*",

The majority of the north Korean population is in the 20s - 30s range, perfect age for the military. A lot of the younger fighting S. Korean population is very \"westernized\" - with all the short comings that this entails.*\n\n*The entire North Korean population is geared for war - from children to old ladies in the street, ever activity is seen as being part of the military and required to uphold to the same disciplinary standards and due to their Juche ideology, they are militarily self sufficient - that psychopath Stalin (Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili)  is supposedly quoted to have said - \"Quantity has a quality of its own\".*\n\n*While so Western analysists, pundits and policy makers may arrogantly scoff at North Korea's military tech, it would be like a larger supposedly dangerous predator being swamped by a super colony of fire ants, or hornets - they are able to churn out vast quantities of soviet era weaponry with zero input from anyone - and have a population that is intimately versed in how to use this soviet tech.*\n\n*Being given updated Russian weapon blue prints will simply change what they are able to churn out in vast quantities. Being given a secure food supply , fertilizers etc will also divert more resources to updating their military. Their juche ideology prohibits them from becoming dependent on anyone even their bosom buddies.*\n\n[*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche)\n\n*So with those numbers, I am not sure S. Korea can afford to lose even a single digit percentage of its population (even just Ukrainian style refugee outflows), to a conflict with the North.

With Russia's relationship to Vietnam, making it extremely unlikely Vietnam will ever join theUS in a throw down with China (because Vietnam has territorial disputes with China, the US might want to enflame like with the Philippines).*\n\n*Leaving the US with the Philippines also creates many issues that, will pop up in case of a conflict, the poverty level will require the US to sink resources into assuaging the population to try and quell any internal rebellions, few will be willing to die for the empire and its elite vassals due to empty promises of \"democracy\" or \"joining the EU\" and what not.*\n\n*People might have forgotten but there were brutal anti colonial wars fought between the Filipino peasantry and both Spain and the US, these sentiments can be re-enflamed, and turned against the US, and its elite vassals like President Marcos, creating a guerrilla style partisan army split within the Philippines - because some elite factions like that of former President Rodrigo Duterte are pro-China/Russia.* \n\n*This potential split echos what happened with both Vietnam and Korea.* \n\n*A very truncated history - It used to be one Korea, Japan Colonized it for 35 years, they were then eventually expelled by the USSR and Peasantry of Korea. The US came and sided with a group of the former Japanese Collaborators who used to be the elites under Japanese rule, who had been driven back and hence the divide started the Korean War leading to North and South.

All of these countries built their industry on cheap materials acquired through slave labour or labour that was so cheap, might as well be slaves.
