            "Looking at buying a MacBook for my last year of my computer science degree. I may do grad school and plan to use it for my eventual job after my degree. I do web design, general programming, work with databases, and do 2D game design in my free time. I was leaning towards either getting the M3 air with 24GB of RAM or waiting for the next pro this winter and sticking it out with my current laptop. Can anyone with a similar workflow help me decide which may be best? I want this to be my daily driver for the next 3-4 years as I upgrade every other generation at earliest. It\u2019s not about \u201coh should I wait for what\u2019s around the corner\u201d it\u2019s more so I want to get what\u2019s best for my needs.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve never gotten a MacBook new before so I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re expected to refresh the pro this September or if it\u2019s going to be closer to December/January",
            "Is there a problem in not using magsafe with the macbook pro m2? It comes with a 140W charger, the problem is that I'm going to use a dock, and the macbook will only draw 89W from it. Can this impact performance?",
            "Hello! \n\nI am considering treating myself to a new laptop after my trusty 8-years-old Macbook Air has been having lots of problems. \n\nI used Mac Book Pro at work, and loved it, so thinking to get that. \n\nI just heard about 'Apple Intelligence' coming out, and that it will be a software update into Macs in M series. I want to have access to this Apple Intelligence feature / capability. \n\nEven though the announcement says it will be available to M series, so if I buy an M series Mac now, I will get Apple Intelligence... I wanted to confirm with this community of more experienced Apple consumers, before I make the purchase. \n\nWould I be better off waiting until Apple Intelligence has already been pushed out as a software update, and perhaps get the next version of Macs after that, to make sure Apple Intelligence functions properly / optimally by getting the next gen hardware? \n\nOr do you think just getting M series Macbook Pro currently sold at Apple will do the trick?  I am looking at M3 Pro, 12-Core CPU\n18-Core GPU\n18GB Unified Memory\n512GB SSD Storage\u00b9\n\nThere is also the 36 GB Unified Memory version which is $400 more. Is that better for the Apple Intelligence? \n\n\nSorry if these are naive questions, I am not an experienced Apple shopper..."

What a day, this was probably the most jam packed WWDC I have watched in a long time. They definitely went deeper on integration that I thought they would. Hats off to the developers working crazy hours to make the features announced a reality.",
            "I\u2019m here to overreact. And also download a beta I have no business downloading.",

            "confirmed 15 pro only\n\n> Apple Intelligence will be available in beta on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPad and Mac with M1 and later, with Siri and device language set to U.S. English, as part of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia this fall.\n> Some features, additional languages, and platforms will be coming over the course of the next year.",

            "I\u2019m gonna be honest, quality of life updates made me way more excited than just some mind blowing \u201crevolutionary\u201d feature people in this sub want every year seemingly lol",
            "Surprised by the negativity in the chat.\n\nThought it was fairly well, and pretty fun.",
            "Biggest feature for me is ScreenShare finally being able to remotely control a device. I\u2019m immediately getting an iPad for my mom and if she can handle it, for my grandmother as well. I did not want to fiddle with a third party app for this. \n\nOther than that, being able to move icons anywhere you want finally on the Home Screen is great. Took way too long. \n\nThe AI stuff is about what I thought it would be. I\u2019m interested in the built in analysis and summary stuff more than I am in the chat bot stuff since there are so many options now. I\u2019ve got my Action Button already set to use Copilot and I use it over Siri for anything that isn\u2019t setting a timer or alert.",
            "Best WWDC in a long, long time.",

            "I think analysts are vastly underestimating how sticky Apple\u2019s deployment of AI will make its products. Once Apple Intelligence integrates with all of your personal info it will be even more difficult to switch.",
            "Did I see shot on iPhone again?",
            "A quick thought from somebody who\u2019s been jail breaking their iPhones since iPod touch 5. \n\nApple has essentially added almost ALL the features I\u2019ve ever jailbroken for. \n\nThe only thing they\u2019re missing that I\u2019d want (faceid or passcode to turn off) they can\u2019t do I think (TSA rules I think)\n\nBut everything else they\u2019ve finally finished adding. Amazing progress over these 13 years.",

            "I mean, the AI stuff is neat, but I'm most hyped for WatchOS \ud83d\ude05",
            "Gonna be honest but today's WWDC seems like a long-overdue Apple moment.\n\nFirst, iPhone Mirroring is pretty useful for many people - including myself - who mostly sit on their notebooks rather than phone. Ability to stream and use iPhone is superb! \n\nSecondly, their Math Notes implementation was very Steve Jobs-esque. Such a straightforward use of Machine Learning but excellently implemented!\n\nThirdly and most importantly, Apple Intelligence replaces features/apps like Grammarly, Mimestream and many other apps when it comes writing/editing and general productivity improvements.\nI am not even a huge emoji person and Genmoji etc. looked quite cool!\n\nToday's presentation just obliterated all the hype Microsoft built around their Copilot-PCs.\n\nSuper excited for the upcoming updates!",

            "\u201cAI for the rest of us\u201d is pretty brilliant from a marketing perspective. Boomers use Siri like the rest of us so this is the perfect on ramp for that demographic. Trash the buzzwords and focus on making life easier for non tech savvy consumers. Great strategy from Apple",
            "The math notes was one of the more impressive features to me, I can see lazy college students buying an iPad just for that",
            "Most excited for doing pencil math on my iPad instead of typing it on a calculator. Or wasting paper.",
            "So how about homepods in combination with AI Siri? If I have a \u2018smart\u2019 Siri on my Mac and iPhone, will I still have dumb siri on my homepods? (And will my mac and iPhone laugh in her face?)",
            "Did they mention RCS at all?",
            "So the AI stuff isn't coming soon, just 'later this year', or did I mishear that? Some of it looked cool, but the disconnect between Siri and ChatGPT seemed really clunky to me - I'm not sure people will really understand where one starts and the other ends",
            "No mention of CarPlay 2.0, I wonder if many of the early auto supporters have jumped ship?",
            "So do you need a 15 Pro to use all these new features, or is it just required for it to be done on-device?\n\nEdit: confirmed to be 15 Pro only. That\u2019s absolutely insane.",

            "Private Cloud Compute was the biggest surprise and is underappreciated imo",
            "After the whole parkour transition, I really think they should've panned down at the end to show Craig standing beside the stunt person. Have Craig thank the stunt person for making him look good.   \n  \nThey obviously didn't try to hide the stunt person's face and it would've been funny to outright acknowledge it. Plus, stunt performers never get the credit they deserve.",
            "Wtf so no AI for the iPhone 14 Pro?! \n\nHuge L",
            "Something I noticed in the WatchOS 11 reveal is the Vitals app shows an O2 tracker. does this mean Apple finally addressed the patent ban and the feature will return to new watches?",
            "The QoL updates to iOS and macOS are huge.\n\nThe AI stuff was mixed. Some pretty good stuff, and some embarrassing Stable Diffusion images, the Genmoji was probably the best implementation of SD I have seen yet at least.",
            "The multiple AI models running on this phone will be confusing to a lot of folks I think. It seems like Apple Intelligence is useful to run tasks that are complicated within multiple apps on your phone vs GPT4 which is more of a replacement for traditional googling. There is crossover between the functionality like text generation and image generation which may confuse some of the older generation which Apple will need to figure out but Google may suffer from this integration",
            "I have yet to see any AI generated image that looks anywhere close to good. If anything what was shown today looks as though a sweatshop made them.\n\nMath notes looks great and if it is sophisticated enough to calculate more complex strings I can see it being a useful resource for students. It helps you still need to draw out the formula so you can just keep going to confirm the result is correct.\n\nAll OS updates today dealt more with refinement than huge new features across the board. I think this is good. Hopefully it comes with a ton of bug fixes too. Also the multiple Control Center pages makes me think of the old Control Center before the redesign in iOS 11(?)\n\nThe way Craig said \u201cgamers\u201d at one point sounded like a slur and I think that is hilarious. The announcement of a handful of Ubisoft games coming to Apple platforms isn\u2019t nearly as big a deal to me as Death Stranding and Resident Evil. However, if they start porting some older games from their catalog I would be interested.",

            "So...\n\nIntro rocked.\n\nvOS: making that screen larger, new gestures, ground for future 3D photo/video proliferation, and...\n\niOS: Apple added free placement of icons (something everyone else had for ages), ~~Material You~~ recolorable icons, and customizable lock screen shortcuts. Good job Apple! Though features with Control Center, better iMessage, and tap to pay look interesting.\n\niPadOS: On one hand, Calculator and Notes updates look cool (if only I used either of them instead of better specialized *and* crossplatform apps). On other... That's the update to their \"most powerful lineup\"? Seriously? Yes, it gets iOS features like icons and photos app, but really?\n\nmacOS: Samsung/Microsoft had this new continuity feature for a while now. I usually just turn it off, because phone apps on computer is not the best experience and 99% of things I use phone for, computer does it better, even if not as mobile.\n\nSide note: You know what a killer continuity feature could be? Apple Music handoff between all your devices with Apple Music. You can play music through your phone with AirPods, professional-grade headphones connected to Mac, iPad speakers, even your Windows or Android device with Apple Music (yes, that's a thing) - and it will pick up right where you left it, at same time, in same song, with same history and queue. Eh, maybe someone would see this comment and implement it.\n\nmacOS cont.: Finally Apple has window snapping. Passwords are good if you only have Apple's devices - otherwise, I suspect you would be better off with an existing crossplatform solution. Gaming: section felt like \"please, please port some games to out store\". What were the news on last years' worth of games on Mac?\n\nAI: And here's the big thing for this year. Let's see how useful it really is. Lots of promises, but both Siri and AI also have lots of reputation for not quite delivering the exact result user wants.",

            "Here's compatibility rundown of the announced OSes:\n\n#iOS 18\n\n- iOS 18 is compatible with **all devices capable of running iOS 17**. That means the SE 2 and 3, XS, XR, and later.

I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri.\n2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap.\n3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat.\n4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS \u2014 if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain \u2014 but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.  \n5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.)\n6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today\u2019s presentation was using the raw power of Apple\u2019s flagship LLM to\u2026 navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I\u2019ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.)\n\nI get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I\u2019m very interested to get my hands on this release.",

Well it will actually be two by the time it's ready.\n\nBut we were happily living without it until now. Newer iPhones having it doesn't suddenly make your iPhone any worse than it currently is.\n\nAnd I think some people might overrate how often would they actually use it. Let's use our brains while we still can. We will be looking back at these \"good old times\" one day thinking how good it was when everything wasn't done by AI yet. It will just be boring when every message, email etc. will be generated with one click.",

The *billions* of dollars involved takes care of any hurt feelings.

I was planning to buy a 16 Pro Max this year, specifically Apple Intelligence, and now I probably won\u2019t. \n\nThough I do wonder how much of this is Apple desperately wanting to limit the strain on the AI services at least temporarily. A phased rollout would make a whole lot of sense and a probably temporary delay blamed on the EU would be a good way to do that without getting users all too mad. \n\nI\u2019m certainly disappointed. iOS 18 basically isn\u2019t anything except Apple intelligence that is of interest to me personally.",
            "Apple Intelligence I can potentially understand, although ChatGPT does operate there.\n\nDon't understand why they would block iPhone mirroring though. Android phones have been mirrored on computers for years.",
            "These are valid concerns from Apple. If the EU regulations would require them to give third parties the same access as Apple Intelligence, Screen Sharing and iPhone Mirroring then there is all kinds of nefarious things they could do with it, like sending all your photos, emails, calender entries, messages to a third party server, or allow third parties to mirror and remotely control your iPhone.",
            "The Empire Struck Back",
            "just on a logical level, if you\u2019re apple, what is the point of releasing new features in a zone in which you\u2019re required by law to immediately commoditize them? especially if it means extra work on your own part in order to do it? new features are now 2x as hard to build in the eu because they have to generalize all the apis and functionality such that any apple integration (such as the integration with apple intelligence) can be replaced by third parties. it disincentivizes building new stuff, so as a result, the eu will get less new stuff.",
            "Let me tinfoil hat this as honestly, not an Apple fan boy per se. also not an Apple hater. I enjoy my Apple products that I own, but if there was something better suited for my needs I would switch.\n\nNow that that\u2019s over with, week ago or so when I read Apple Intelligence was being delayed past official release of IOS 18. It made me second guess my excited upgrade decision to iPhone 16 XXX.. Early adopters usually get the crap end of stick anyway because the second iteration of a new product is usually substantially better.\n\nNow, Apple Intelligence also was/is only initially  offered in US English. PERHAPS not only does it struggle with the language itself, but also the accents for other nationalities.\n\nThird, As much as I agree Apple isn\u2019t doing this just out of \u201cspite\u201d or pettiness, Apple has done petty stuff in the past.\n\nSo now you have a perfect storm; Apple Intelligence was always going to be in \u201cbeta\u201d long in to release of  iPhone 16/IOS18. It struggles with other languages as is. So let\u2019s use this opportunity where it wouldn\u2019t work well in these regions to also attempt to stir up some hate for the UE regulations. Apple gets to shift blame, while not getting review bombed on a product feature that was never ready to work properly in the EU anyways. Let the US/CAD market test and refine it first.  Once it\u2019s done I guarantee Apple will push it out to the EU and say they are going to attempt to release and and see if the regulators have a problem with it. \n\nIt\u2019s just a massive win as it want ready, and PR win for Apple.\n\nBut what do I know..",
            "So, in a quagmire of regulations that, if they're like most regulations (and I suspect they are), are poorly defined (probably deliberately) and often contradictory, with the threat of massive fines that look a lot like a money grab by the EU, Apple has chosen not to implement technology that could easily violate one or more regulations depending on how the regulators decide to interpret them. For example, what does this mean, exactly: \"They\u2019re barred from combining personal data across their different services..\"?\n\nI'm sure this comment will get downvoted because people will interpret Apple's decision as merely capricious and retaliatory. How dare it take action to protect itself (and its shareholders) from the capricious and retaliatory actions of the EU? Apple and its shareholders have no rights, only \"the consumer\" has them. Apple exists to serve consumers, according to how the EU decides is best for them. That's the baseline perspective in Reddit (and elsewhere).\n\nIn reality, this is Apple saying, \"Sorry, EU customers, but your governments have made it impossible for us to do business with you the way that you and we would like to do it. They are forcing us to do things we don't think are in the best interests of either of us, and because of that, we can't provide certain features. We would like to offer products that you can voluntarily purchase or not, but your governments don't believe you are capable of making these decisions for yourselves. The result is that we are unable to provide certain features because we cannot do so according to the regulations and under the threat of interpretations that we can't possibly anticipate.\"\n\nIf you want to blame Apple, knock yourself out. But I can't blame them.\n\nEdit: I'm pleasantly surprised to see how many upvotes I'm getting.",

I have an expensive gaming computer but I still wait for sales before I buy games.

They aggressively deprecate and modify APIs to force developers to constantly update their apps to keep them functional, so it\u2019s not economical to sell apps once. They also don\u2019t have an upgrade facility in the App Store. Should a developer want to sell a new version, they have to list a completely new app, losing their SEO, reviews, organic links, and prior marketing links. This in turn forces devs to \u201cupgrade\u201d by ring-fencing features behind shitty micro-transactions. Apple also prevents devs from distributing apps outside the App Store. So unless an app can thrive on only 70% of the revenue, it never sees the light of day. Subscriptions have industry-wide higher ARPU. Due in part to people forgetting they have those subscriptions (up to 40% of SaaS subscriptions are unused), and the human psychology aspect which sees a \u201csmall\u201d monthly fee and doesn\u2019t comprehend how expensive that is over several years.",

            "Well sure, being not that big of a deal goes in both directions, but it makes zero sense when the two options are \"Download > Click play\" or \"Spend $40 > Click play.\" Both options take near the exact same amount of time and have the same learning curve. Zero.\n\nAlso not that it's terribly important, but these game streaming services shut down all of the time. What happens to \"your\" games when this one inevitably does?",
            "yeah but it's not nearly as time consuming as pirating movies. not only that but games last a longer before having to get a new one if you're that lazy. $40 for 30 year old games you can't own is a scam bro. But hey go for it it's your money to burn lol",
            "There was another article on here that talks about Apple\u2019s deal with OpenAI",
            "I said I wouldn\u2019t mind time \u201cto make sure it\u2019s safe\u201d not that I deem anything unsafe. If they\u2019re concerned about regulations mandating safeguards, we should be concerned why they are worried they won\u2019t comply.",

It doesn\u2019t remove your ability to download them later.\n\nDownloading most media is pretty easy these days, but I\u2019ll bet you have at least one streaming service for the convenience of it. I\u2019m not the target audience for this game streaming service, but I understand the appeal.",
            "From direct sources (i.e. Apple\u2019s and OpenAI\u2019s blog posts), I don\u2019t directly see confirmation of this, but even if that is the case and Apple pays OpenAI with exposure (you can access more features with an OpenAI premium account, after all), it doesn\u2019t change that requests to ChatGPT are only done if the user wants to, with additional privacy protections like IP obfuscation in place.",
            "The regulations Apple is worried about aren\u2019t about \u201chumanity\u201d, they\u2019re about the DMA, i.e. money.",
            "Humanity is everything, including money and markets. Without humans, there would be no money.\n\nBeing concerned about a few massive companies controlling a massive amount of personal data (set to increase with personal context tracking) without adequate external checks and balances is reasonable.",
