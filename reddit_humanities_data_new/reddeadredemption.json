            "Why is my dead eye different? It doesnt do the original deadeye effect where you can shoot different people at the same time.",
            "Hey guys, I'm on my first playthrough of RDR2 and I'm near the end of the chapter 2 mission where you take out the O'Driscoll camp and have to search Colm's cabin for money in the chimney. The game prompted me to pick up a shotgun on the mantle, open the weapons menu, maintain the shotgun, and clean the shotgun. I can't clean the shotgun. I don't have any materials to do that, and the gun also says it's already clean. Now I'm physically locked in place (cannot walk anywhere or interact with anything) until I complete this seemingly impossible task? Am I missing something obvious here? \ud83d\ude05",
            "Hey I am playing after American venom and there\u2019s a drought of missions and bounties is there a way to get more missions as John after American venom besides the farm chores\u00a0",
            "I bought the game back in 2020, played it once and didn't go back. Picked it up again a couple of days ago, really enjoying it then something happened that made me recall why I hadn't played it. The save game mechanics suck, unless I'm doing something wrong? What is the best approach to saving the game to minimise disappointment and frustration. Appreciate any pointers.",
            "I started playing the online version with a couple of friends. Any suggestions on activities that we can all do to make $$$? we already finished the main missions.",
            "is there a main story? Im not far into it-maybe 2 or 3 chapters-but a lot of the missions seem to be bullshit fetch quests or just an excuse to roam around. Some of them seem like main story type of missions. And if you just want to do the main story without bullshit side missions, can you? is there a way to tell them apart? One mission was dumb as fuck, i just had to take a bag back from a coyote. It took 2 seconds.",
            "You're only in chapter 1 or 2 probably. Keep going.",
            "There are 5 levels of deadeye, each has different or additional game mechanics.  They are unlocked during certain story missions.   There's also a one-shot free-aim quickdraw dead eye mode, different than normal deadeye.  The game mechanics in this game can get a little complicated.",
            "reload the game go to gun smith buy gun oli loot chminey trust",
            "This is wild. Never considered this as a possibility. Either try and reload an old save to do it again after buying some gun oil, or (and you should do this anyway) loot all the O'Driscols after the first assault, but BEFORE going to the cabin door. Either someone will give you gun oil or it can be found somewhere near that camp fire",
            "That sounds like a nasty bug.  You can probably pick up gun oil by looting O'Driscolls, it's a fairly common item.   BTW, if you want to loot all the bodies before the law showing up, save the shotgun step for last, as the lawmen show up after a short time delay after completing the mission.",
            "Unfortunately, no. There's a couple bounties that will have popped up, but you've probably seen them all. There's one stranger mission that appears that only John can do, and a couple of them can only be finished by him.\n\nIf you did as much as you could with Arthur, there's not much left for John, other than the new side mission chain and bounties, and non-mission stuff like challenges, hunts, collections, and other stuff. There are quite a few easter eggs you can discover wandering around that won't show up as missions, but tie up some loose story points about other characters.",
            "What exactly is disappointing? I'm disappointed by the way they don't save your exact place (usually, unless you make a camp), and when you reload, you're \"hanging out\" near where you were with the world basically refreshed. No way around that. That's how Rockstar does its engine. Its one of the biggest weak points.\n\nI turn off autosave. Manual saves only.\\* Got into the habit real fast of making saves before starting any mission, and most of the time -- except when I forget -- after a good collection. This way I can go on a tear or make a mistake and won't have an autosave with stuff I don't want.\n\n^(\\*Actually I turned it back on during the final two missions of Chapter 6, so I could have an extra save between the back to back missions. But immediately turned it off again.)",
            "I think it's just an auto-save thing and if you fail a mission, it lets you go to checkpoints. I put in like 2 or 3 hours into it this week myself and it's one of the least fun games I've ever played.\u00a0",
            "Probably rage bait but do you have color blindness? Main missions are yellow and side missions are white or a question mark.",
            "Like all Rockstar games, there are main missions and side missions. Most side missions you can do whenever, although a few will expire.\n\nMain story quests are yellow.\n\nIf you want a list of main story missions (potential spoilers): [https://www.ign.com/wikis/red-dead-redemption-2/Walkthrough\\_and\\_Mission\\_List](https://www.ign.com/wikis/red-dead-redemption-2/Walkthrough_and_Mission_List) \n\nThe guy taking photos had a white icon, it's a Stranger mission, not the main story. If you avoid them all, though, you'll miss out on some good stuff.\n\nIf you want to know what you can miss out on if you ignore it (potential spoilers): [https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Missable\\_Content\\_in\\_Redemption\\_2](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Missable_Content_in_Redemption_2) \n\nIf you just want the story and don't care, just do the yellow missions. If you hit a point where there are none, you may need to let some time pass.",
            "nah im in chapter 5",
            "Thanks for this, appreciate you taking the time to respond. \n\nWell I think you've summed it up. The refreshed game environment on re-loading leaves me disoriented and feeling like I've missed something. Although a little better for knowing that's just how it is.  I'm going to start a new game again over the weekend, autosave off and disciplined saving, What's going on when you die, that feels kind of awkward too, I see money disappearing when I respawn? Also, if you don't mind, what are the implications of replaying a quest in the Chapter menu? Cheers.",
            "Weird. If you're not doing something wrong, it must be a bad glitch. By Ch 3, you can mark as many as you can in the time, which should be 2-4 easy. By Ch 5 you can also pull the trigger and fire without marking and keep shooting like that in dead eye for as long as the meter lasts.\n\nWhat's it doing instead? Still auto marking?\n\nYou can't shoot two people literally at the same time, but if you have both pistols out, you can hit two pretty fast in dead eye.",
            "I'm not 100% clear on the death mechanics, it's one of the things I reload for. I know it usually takes some money if you die outside a mission. It takes some percentage, and if you die more in a short time period, that percentage gets higher. But I've had times where it looked like no money was taken. Not sure if I got lucky with a glitch sometimes, or if there's certain conditions, like you only lose money when killed by people.\n\nYou respawn similar to a game load, near where you died.\n\nDeath in a mission you just lose mission progress and either start over or restart at a checkpoint (which can count against you in some missions depending on Gold requirements). There's never a penalty beyond that.\n\nReplaying a mission usually acts like loading a save. After the mission is over, you'll be near where you were with the world reset. Stuff you collect and do won't carry over on a redo, so if there's money or items to collect, it's best to spend the time to collect them on the first playthrough, and worry about being quick later."
