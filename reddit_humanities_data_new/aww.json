            "Please note:  effective October 9, all content posted to /r/aww *must* be original content (OC) only.  \n\nOn July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). \n\nBeyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). \n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  \n2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  \n3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  \n4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  \n5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  \n6. Encouraging others to do all the above.  \n\nIf you're tired of all the chaos on Reddit, leave it behind and join /r/aww's Discord server to share and view all things adorable: https://discord.gg/UXfd5Pn\n\n---\n\n[](#autoignorereports)\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Still, figured i'd share my opinion.",

            "Sure it is. You wrote the prompt, then fed it to the AI and selected the best output that the AI generated, possibly iterating on the result to get something you wanted. The AI is just the tool you used to create it.",
            "There should be an option for other users to crosspost other users posts into these smaller subs when they feel like they fit well. Kind of like a reblog, so that OC is attributed and you just see who crossposted it",
            "did you report it?  automod and regex are good, but there are some terms that cause way more false positives than necessary (especially passed)",
            "> though I question how many people posting stuff that's not OC is doing it to karma farm vs just posting stuff they think is cute/neat.\n\nhow do you think the karma whores become karma whores in the first place?  you post a few things you think are cute, you get dopamine from all the upvotes and comments, you do some research, you post more things that you think are cute, you start studying karma patterns, learn which days and times and subs to post in, start looking for more appropriate content strictly to post... there is no dividing line.  \n\nBesides, reddit's terms have always prohibited posting content that you do not own or own the rights to, they just don't do any proactive enforcement of it.",
            "Ok cool! Nice to meet you",
            "No, it's not. The prompt is the only part that's original content. The AI did everything else, using uncredited sources that aren't your work. That is in no way original content.",
            "No, you're telling an ai to copy-paste pieces of stolen artwork together based on a few words. It's like a frankenstein trace job but even lazier and you'll never even know where the pieces came from.",
            "Nope. A better analogy is having someone write your school essay. You supply the prompt, you choose the best output.  It's not your content.",
            "Yes, but the A.I. you used to generate it must be trained on your own model with your own original pictures. That way, it's original through-and-through.",
            "Hmm, I can't remember so I probably didn't.",
            "So than no art is original, because literally every real life artist bases their work on other artists before them\u2026. Just like the ai",
            "It doesn\u2019t copy and paste lmao, it bases their creations on related art on the internet. It literally does the same thing as any real life artist, people base their art on other peoples work, just like the ai. They don\u2019t steal anything",
            "The AI systems are a lot more complex than mere copy-pasting. They distill the training data down into a raw mathematical model of statistical likelihood that is then used to generate the content based on what it's already generated. Basically, it generates each individual pixel based on the prompt and all the pixels it's already generated.",
            "Except those artists are using their own creative lens and talent. You're just typing a prompt. That's like telling an artist to paint something and then taking the credit yourself. It requires zero effort, it's not your original content, and it's something literally anyone can do with minimal effort and dedication. Do not compare your own ability to form a sentence with the lifetime of skill artists accumulate. That's arrogance.\n\nAI requires no talent to use. It's not interesting. It's the lowest form of creation. It's not like \"being inspired\" by other people, it's literally stealing from other people. This is not the first time I've heard this asinine argument in favor of using AI to create art. Being \"amazing at typing prompts\" is not a skill.",
            "Unlike real artists, AI doesn't source their work or credit the original artists who it drew inspiration from. Not to mention, at least real art is produced by genuine creativity and thoughtfulness. All AI does is fabricate an image based on an algorithm and user prompt. And before you say \"Oh, but you need creativity to generate the prompt\", understand that thinking about an idea versus actually putting effort into solidifying it are not the same thing. There is a substantial difference between thinking and doing.",
            "Okay, so it's extra super duper fancy copy-pasting. Doesn't make it art, dude.",
            "As an artist, hard agree",
            "Taking photos of animals is stealing from nature, then, OkiDokiPanic. Perhaps you should do a bit more research before falsely claiming that AI art is merely copy-and-pasting.",
            "No, it\u2019s not copy pasting",
            "Okay, smooth brain. Answer me this; Before AI, let's say you commissioned an artist and gave them a description of what you wanted. After the whole process of finetuning the art with your artist, making sure they give you exactly what you want, would you have taken credit for the final image?   \nNo?  \nThen why do you think you can take credit for an AI generated image? You also legally can't. AI generated images are not copyrightable for a reason. You didn't do anything. Nothing of the actual creative process, composition, line work, color theory, lighting, anatomy, style, nothing about it came from you. \n\n\"But I wrote the prompt!\" Okay, should we then give Pope what's-his-name the credit for the Sistine chapel? He's the one that gave the instructions of what he wanted to Michelangelo, after all.   \nOr was Mona Lisa the actual artistic genuis behind her portrait because she commissioned Da Vinci to paint her?\n\nPrompt-writing is not art. And it never will be art. Deal with it."
