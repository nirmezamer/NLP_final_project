Not no licensed social worker or NP. \n\nHe needs a clinical psychologist (masters or doctorate) and a psychiatrist (MD/DO). \n\nIdeally both of them on the younger side so there won't be LGBT related stigma to worry about or old ass \"just stop your addiction\" bullcrap. For that reason avoid boomer practicioners, it's sad to say but you might need to avoid direct immigrant practicioners too if they aren't clearly ok with homosexuality and/or non-judgmental treatment of addiction. His brain has been rewired and needs this shit. \n\nIt's ok to leave, but understand if you stay you have a long road ahead of you with possible relapses before it's finally ok. \n\nAnd if he even manages to shake this, you'll need couples therapy : you to work through the resentment and him to work through the guilt and shame. \n\nVery hard situation and choices.

I wasn\u2019t popular so like one person bid. But then afterwards the guy (in grade 10 or 11) tells this grade 9 I\u2019m going to make you my b\u2014-  like who the heck says that to a 14 year old?! Obviously I backed out told the student council to pay him back cause no. \n\n2.

Like wow so clever. \n\nThe bullying I got was from being autistic so naturally group of kids I thought were all my friends started FB group called we hate <insert my name here> and it\u2019s not because he\u2019s gay (long story).

The real story is that he had either had a relationship with or made a pass at a younger assistant minister, so, to hush it up, it was arranged that he would leave town on a pretense. Ironically, the same church will now perform gay marriages. \n\nIn the 1990s, I was up for a Rhodes scholarship, but didn't make it past the first interview. Someone looked into it, and it was because I had been open about my gay rights activism. Of course, considering what we now know about Cecil Rhodes, that's seriously ironic . . .",

Punched, kicked, stabbed with compasses at school, bricks dropped on my head, shot with pellet guns, partially drowned, went on for years. Then Aids happened which just compounded the torture and included adults into the mix.\n\nAll sounds very sad and bad but I came out of it all and haven't let it ruin my life, I still sometimes wince when I see two guys holding hands in the street. I like it a lot but the kneejerk response is subconscious.\n\nI'm glad we've come far.\n\nBest thing was getting married",

I was buddies with one of the only out gay guys from the town and he\u2019s told me of straight up being denied service at a couple different local businesses because people knew of him as being a gay man. \n\nWorst for me throughout my life is only being called slurs out of a moving car. Other than that I haven\u2019t faced much. I guess I\u2019ve been in many social situations where I wasn\u2019t known to be gay and had to listen to groups share their homophobic views back and forth. Awkward and annoying",

On New Year\u2019s Eve, I was downtown wearing a black t-shirt, black pants, black AF1s, and a black and gold foil jacket\u2014the jacket was the only flashy thing I had on. As I was walking with a friend from one bar to another to meet up with more friends, a guy in a restaurant yelled \u201cFaggot!\u201d out of an open window.\n\nI stopped, stared at him, and said, \u201cWow, really?\u201d That set him off. He came outside, repeatedly yelling, \u201cWhat are you going to do about it?\u201d This guy was built and tall, probably had been in the military. Despite knowing I shouldn\u2019t engage, I responded, \u201cAre you missing your barrack days?\u201d My friend called him a homophobic asshole at the same time.\n\nIgnoring my comment, he shoved my friend, who is straight, launching him. That\u2019s when his friends grabbed him to hold him back. As he acted crazier trying to break free, I helped my fallen friend and sarcastically told the crazy guy to have a good night.\n\nI bought my friend drinks for the rest of the night as thanks for trying to defend me, even though he knew he was outmatched. That meant a lot to me.\n\nSo yeah, just walking down the street in a shiny gold jacket got me hate crimed.",

Lived there a year or so, they were very nice. I came out as gay and started having boys over. They said they couldn't allow that to happen under their roof, for Christian reasons, told me I couldn't have boys over. Well, I had a boy over again and literally while I was giving him a bj on the couch down there the woman shouted down to me from upstairs asking me to come up there, so I did and she said he needed to leave.

I understand the doing stuff like that at the club probably isn\u2019t the most ideal spot but I didn\u2019t get why we would have got anxiety from that. \n\nFor a while he didn\u2019t bring it up much, but would mention occasionally about it. It wasn\u2019t until a few days ago when he brought it up again that I tried to start understanding what went on. I eventually learned that my bf had asked the guy to stop. And that the guy just hold his head down on his dick and made him swallow it. Which I know my bf wouldn\u2019t like as he hasn\u2019t been super keen on swallowing my own. After that had happened, the guy got mad at my bf and just left the club. I also learned out that my bf had then gotten an std from him and didn\u2019t have sex for a long time as he was very afraid of catching something from someone. \n\nIs this rape? What should I do.

            "Yeah that is definitely intentional/2nd degree. \n\nHe was already passive because of an underlying deep trauma, that triggered again, and they, genuinely, froze\n\nThis is my opinion, coming from personal experience as a victim\n\nBeing vulnerable is very hard, because you think you do not have a safety net, that's why religious people call it leap of faith, scientists call it one small step for man, and agnostic people only believe if there is proof. \n\nJust even talking about it, or seeing the signs is the giant baby steps that don't look big to one party, but it's insanely huge to the one hurting.",
            "Yes; he was raped.  I think that telling you, especially if you reacted sympathetically, is the first step towards his healing.  If he's been keeping this experience bottled inside of him all this time, it's hardly a wonder that he's become anxiety ridden.  The more he can talk about it, the sooner he'll come to grips with it. If this continues to live, rent-free in his head, he might need to speak to a therapist.  Good luck!",
            "It def is rape. I am so sorry he went through this. Sending him love and hugs \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udec2",
            "Yes, rape. First concern is the mental health of your bf. He needs counseling and possibly meds (I have high anxiety in general). At some point, if it's healthy for him to pursue, file charges. Problem is having proof so be careful before you go down that road. It can add a lot of pressure on your bf",
            "Any time anyone is subjected to sexual touching, penetration, harassment that they do not want\u2026 it\u2019s rape or sexual assault. \nYes this would definitely fall into rape/sexual assault. \n\nAs for the panic attacks it sounds like PTSS (formerly PTSD). \n\nHe needs to seek therapy and a good psychiatrist, preferably one with experience with SA/rape.",
            "Doesn't sound like rape. Sounds more like sexy times at the club mixed with regret. You're BF was free to leave and who forced him to walk to the bathroom and get into the stall? It was obvious what was going to happen in there.",
            "absolutely. even this sentence alone (\"The guy brought him into the bathroom and made him suck him off\"), the word \"made\" would classify the situation as rape and/or SA",
            "Everyone on Reddit will say it was rape. \"The moment he says to stop and he doesn't, it's rape.\"  I see the reality of the situation. It's a club. There's likely drugs and drinking involved.  In sex its very common for a dom top to hold the guys head so he will swallow.  I had it happen to me and I don't feel I was raped.  He said he was going to cum and I started to pull away, instead he held my head and pushed his dick down my throat so I would swallow.  It was hot.  Technically, I could say that was rape.  But, it's really common dom top behavior.  That said, I've been sucking this guy for about 3 years, so he was comfortable with me.  Maybe that's why he felt it was ok to do that?",
            "[removed]",
            "Bingo. It\u2019s a traumatic event that sometimes you never get past. I can speak from personal experience on this one. No is a complete sentence. That\u2019s all.",
            "Bit? He should have chewed his dick like a f**kin sausage, leaving him traumatized life long!",
            "I thought the same thing",
            "OP said that the bf ASKED the man to stop, like it was only a suggestion. If the bf TOLD the man to stop then yeah it's rape.",
            "I think it\u2019s just going to be very hard for him to file charges tbh. My bf is from another country and the guy was also from another country to my bf. If he wanted to, I imagine he would have to go back to his country to report it and then it would be super difficult as the other guy wasn\u2019t from there.",
            "OP even said that boyfriend ASKED the guy to stop, meaning it was only a suggestion. If he TOLD him to stop then yeah that would classify as rape.",
            "But my bf is mostly a top. He\u2019s told me in the past that he\u2019s not too fussed on dick and loves ass. So I don\u2019t see how this could have been enjoyable at all to him.",
            "Spot on",
            "Considering your past\u00a0 comments, you had sex with everything and everyone when you were 11 years old. Is this some fetish of attention deficite or...?",
            "I was raped my freshman year of college. So anything like this sets me off.",
            "The think is that I can\u2019t relate at all to it. So it makes it hard for me to understand what\u2019s going on in his mind. And he\u2019s never even spoken about it like it\u2019s rape or sexual assault. Does it take a while for victims of rape to realise that it was rape?",
            "Nah just enough to get him out. Bleed that man dick and a fight will happen and his bf will get into much deeper unnecessaries troubles.",
            "Yeah, doesn't sound like that will he the route to go. Just focus on his mental health.",
            "It depends on person or a situation, some know and understand immediately they were raped while others either don't realize it or are in denial about it.",
            "Listen to him patiently, acknowledged his feelings, reflect what he said during a conversation, prompt him gently to speak his feelings more, and allow him to talk.  Then repeat.  That's all you need to do.",
            "Depends who can fight better. It's two men. It's not necessarily that rapist would win the fight."
