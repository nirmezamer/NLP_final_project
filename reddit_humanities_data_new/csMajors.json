Many of those projects haven't been touched in several years, but I've got a couple that I still revisit from time to time.

            "# Should I put one month internship on resume if I left in the middle for a more prestigious internship? Project at current internship is almost done and would enhance resume as far as key words/content goes.\n\nSo finding an internship was rough for swe and I ended up taking whatever I could and started working for an established but low paying fintech company as a devops intern. However, I luckily got a swe internship offer at a pretty prestigous company few days ago and I decided that I have to take.\n\nBy the time I plan on leaving my current internship it would be half way done since it was only 9 week internship to begin with. Ik this is a silly question but I have already done much progress on my intern project and it looks like im going to complete majority of my project by the time I leave. Since this is devops, which is still somewhat related to swe, I got to work with stuff like AWS, Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes, which ive seen all as valuable things that I dont think Ill get to work with in my other internships/projects so itd prob boost my resume in terms of content.\n\nShould I leave it off my resume in case future employers feel suspisous that I did a shortened one month internship or leave it on since there are some valuable things i did learn from the internship?",

I understand that being average doesn\u2019t land u a job but I was hoping maybe I could get a few 1st round interviews so I could practice. I don\u2019t even know how to improve at this point so I was wandering maybe it\u2019s the formatting or something\u2026 I\u2019ve seen people with (in my opinion) worse resumes land jobs. Maybe the issue is with projects? Do companies really look at them?",

A bullet point has its name because it describes a single point, not loads of different things.\n\nFor example, The last bullet point in your non-profit internship is a few sentences showing your soft skills. There are many points to critique on this, the use of multiple sentences on a single bullet point; the claim to have skills without backing them up with statements to prove them; and more.\n\nIt is more of a \u201cI can communicate and solve problems and work in a team and learn quickly and\u2026\u201d which means nothing and is a waste of a bullet point. \n\n3) There is load of white space above and below the resume. It looks quite empty! It\u2019s clear you have some good experience to show, and enough for a one page resume definitely.\n\nTalk about your projects, use up that space.\n\n4) General advice \n\nThe way a resume works for CS is we have our education at the top, then usually followed by our technical skills. This shows the recruiter what languages, frameworks, etc we know so that even a quick glance over will tell them if we have the skills they are looking for in their role.\n\nLet\u2019s say we have the skills for the specific role. The recruiter then looks further down at the experience and projects section, hoping to see evidence of those skills, and other dome general stuff showing qualities like communication skills, good work ethic, enjoyment for learning, problem solving skills, taking ownership and being responsible for the work you produce, etc etc etc\u2026\n\nThe key thing here is to show those skills, not tell them about those skills. You need concrete evidence, not a declaration of saying you can work in a team and solve problems and work on complex apps and\u2026 etc.\n\nFor some of the technical things from your internships and projects, highlight things that show these skills. This could be applying complex concepts into your work like software architecture, multi-threading, design patterns, etc. Tall about the problems you solved, your individual contribution to team projects rather than the output of the whole team. Explain any design decisions you made, or just break down further how you did what you did!\n\nI hope this is helpful!\nYou have some great experience, now\u2019s the time to market yourself and this experience well :)",

I'd probably just remove that first part and start with \"Developed functional app screens\". I don't know if pointing out the Figma part is really necessary since all you did was receive them not create them so it's not an actual skill to highlight\n* I find it weird there are no languages or technologies mentioned in your internship, which makes it feel like maybe you didn't understand the project very well.\n* Just nitpicking now, but \"deployed to multiple classrooms\" uses more correct verbage than \"implemented in multiple classrooms\"\n* The OpenPoll project feels like the same thing as your internship. Maybe when you add technologies to your internship, that will change. If they're the same thing, then remove the project\n* It's very strange that you list Java as your first language (presumably your strongest), but none of your projects used it.

You need more (or only) CS-related ones\n* Having dates on projects is alright, but having the same dates for two different projects is a bit weird. I'm guessing this was coursework and not actual personal projects? I might leave off the dates in that case or fudge the dates a little so they're not exactly the same\n * This combined with your bullet saying you \"Began production\" gives me the impression that you're not good at focusing on a project and finishing it. So I would just say \"Created\" not \"Began production\" or just leave off that bullet altogether\n* What \"Java libraries and APIs\" did you use? If they're noteworthy, then mention them by name. Otherwise, just say Java\n* Leadership is the most confusing section for me. The first and third items list what looks like normal job titles while the second item looks like a normal leadership piece. The descriptions also make me think you meant \"Volunteer Experience\" or something like that?\n* Assuming they were unpaid internships, I would also move the software roles under \"Leadership\" so they are under \"Experience\"\n* I prefer to see skills listed at or near the top not the bottom, but I'm a technical interviewer not a recruiter so I don't really know which way is better\n* Assuming I'm interpreting your resume correctly, it's actually quite impressive but just structured poorly\n\nStraying from the resume review:\n\n* A 4.0 GPA is pretty impressive! If you're attending a pretty reputable college, reach out to your professors and advisors because they should have a network of companies (or at least one) that they may partner with to give out internships. I would imagine a 4.0 GPA would be prioritized\n* Same thing with WCS. My wife was in WCS and found an internship through networking there as did the president of the club at the time",

For example, what is this \"complex game logic\" and why does it matter for the job you're applying to? And if you're applying to be a SWE, they might not care that you implemented different characters but I might as a game designer\n * Along these lines, definitely gear your resume to the job you want.

            "Hi! I think that you should have Awards (which should be under education), Skills, and Projects before Courses (in that order). Take into account that the first thing they see should be what makes you stand out from other candidates, and that is not the courses you have taken at your University since everyone from your major has to take most of them. You can include links to the Github repositories of your projects and a link to your website (you can host it on Git Hub). If you have done volunteering, have held leadership positions, or have participated in extracurricular activity, include that too. I do not think the work experience there is relevant to the job you are applying for, so I would not include it, but that is just me. Also, next to your University, you should include your start and (expected) graduation date, for example, May 2023 - May 2027. It is not clear if you started in May 2023 (which is what I assumed) or if you graduated in May 2023. For the Dean's List include the semesters you have been selected to be in it. You can also include a small statement at the beginning of you resume about your interests and why you stand out as a candidate for the position, it can be just 2 sentences or 3, not too long. Always keep the resume 1 page. I hope my advice helps you. Good luck!\n\nNote: I am not a recruiter or expect in the matter.

The thing is: I've always had realistic expectations 70k instead of 6 figures (Associates degree, not fresh out of highschool, but with experience, internships, etc.). Perhaps I assume that people have the same or similar expectations as me, or even more realistic. At one point I was seriously considering just getting a diploma in the field. For many programmers just getting a job approximately related to their hobby would be a dream come true. That's again only what I've seen - and folks who finish college with at least an AAS tend to have some realistic expectations of what they're worth - since coding is a career path such that if there's something you don't know (you're incompetent) it's obvious and self awareness doesn't seem a major issue for these folks. Why, even I was able to come pretty close to the truth from merely analyzing the testimonies here. Once again I don't mean to discourage anyone; I only want people who may search online, stumble upon this page, and read through some of it to know that their ideas aren't insane - they aren't crazy for arriving to similar conclusions as me and of course to get a little help myself haha.
