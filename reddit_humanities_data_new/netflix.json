I posted this as a separate post but mods deleted that and asked me to post in this pinned thread.  \n\n\nHave a Netflix account with approx $200 gift card balance in it (added many years ago). The reason that didnt get used up is because T-Mobile started offering netflix for free so linked that account with T-Mobile and it was getting paid through T-Mobile. Slowly T-Mobile started charging extra for Netflix as the rates went up and currently it costs $4.50 paid through the T-Mobile bill. But even these charges were getting paid via T-Mobile bill. Netflix told me that the gift card will only get used when the account is billed directly by Netflix.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThe situation now is that we will be outside US for a year+ and I have no clue how to handle this. We are keeping our T-Mobile account to preserve the numbers and also for occasional phone use. But we don\u2019t want to pay the extra $4.50 a month (seems like it is now going up to $8.50 a month even with T-Mobile subsidy). If I cancel the billing via T-Mobile, then it will become an independent account. But Netflix is telling me that there is no way to pause it from taking money from my GC balance every month. And if I cancel, then also I lose the GC balance. Any suggestions on what to do? Thanks",

            "I just started watching it and from episode 1 , I was shocked by their underpayment despite their significant contributions to the franchise. Despite their hard work and dedication, they barely make minimum wage. Considering the physical demands and commitment required, it's baffling that these cheerleaders, who bring in significant revenue for the Dallas Cowboys, are not rewarded accordingly. I can't help but wonder if Charlotte Jones and others in management are laughing behind their backs at how these talented women essentially work for very little. In any other industry, top talent like this would be compensated fairly. For instance, top background dancers for pop singers reportedly earn between $30,000 to $50,000 annually, whereas the documentary revealed that Cowboys cheerleaders earn only around $10,000. The Dallas Cowboys could easily afford to pay them more. Like hello ladies wake up you are being used. What a great documentary exposing misogyny...",

After a few years she was able to make the Cowboys squad and was on the old Cowboys cheerleader show. \n\nAll the former college dancers I know are very proud of their time, and it was devastating to them if they didn't make the pro teams. It's not unlike any other competition, it is a passion at this level, and to some of them it may be a stepping stone into their profession as a professional dancer or an owner/coach of a dance studio.",

The women in charge (DCC alumni) also rubbed me the wrong way. I get that it's a brand, but they were so harsh and critical, even though they admitted that it wasn't like that back in their day. Their moment is over, but they still want to cling to the past as much as they can. Even using outdated music. Okay, so AC/DC is an amazing band and Thunderstruck is a classic.

            "That's not really a defining feature. Most cults suck you in, isolate you from everyone else then threaten to freeze you out if you dare to question the central belief system.\n\nDCC absolutely meet most of the criteria for being a cult if you apply the definitions broadly, eg the brand is the venerable central leader with Jerry Jones, Charlotte and Kelli alternating as proxies.",

            "Why did you reply that to me? I was agreeing with you and explaining to him why they care about being a cheerleader for an NFL team.",
            "Sorry to burst your bubble but the 2022 super bowl saw 114 million viewers while the 2022 world cup final saw 1.5 billion so 10x that of the NFL. Even the champions league final which is Europe only saw 275 million viewers.\nAs to money you have 1 league to deal with while here in the EU you have close to 30 (each country also having a different legal and tax system). In the USA you can get away with a lot more in business than you can here in the EU. Forcing cities to build stadiums or the owner will relocate the team that is simply not done here and well in some countries that will get you killed ( just look at the columbian player that got killed for scoring an own goal in the 1994 world cup).\nAnd yes every team wants to make money but  winning and being the champion is way more important even for owners, and a lot of teams say like Barcelona, Real Madrid, Porto, Benfica, Bayern Munich to name a few are either fully owned or partially owned by the supporters.",
            "Eh.  Sorry.  I was trying to respond to another comment that doesn\u2019t seem to exist any longer and must have hit yours by accident."
