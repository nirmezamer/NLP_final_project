I don't know if that's possible though I'd be interested to see how it works out for you.\u00a0\n\n\nYou should prioritize chase if you really want the FF because of 5/24, and probably leave Amex for last. For the three WF cards, consider that the attune may have a higher minimum starting limit and stricter UW, so you may need to apply earlier in the process for that one. And also consider prioritizing based on your spend - how much are you spending on rent/groceries/golf/etc, and which card is more important to you to get (since you probably will not be able to get all six at once, and are less likely to be approved for two Wells Fargo cards within six months and the bilt makes 3). Consider also that chase may shut down your account entirely when their monthly reviews show 6 new accounts opened back to back - it has happened before. Tbh I'd nix chase entirely, though you'll be locked out of all their cards for two years since you'll be at 5/24 anyway. If you're just using the attune for golf only, I wouldn't prioritize that one tbh.\u00a0\n\n\nI think you should pick one or two that make the most sense based on your spend and long term goals, and not based on churning SUBs.

But call the CD team and ask them, they can answer CD product, called the credit card team to define the category, they can\u2019t give me an answer (they will tell you MCC code, but when MCC code matched and still not trigger the reward, nothing else was done, they rather like to refund $550 annual fee and cancel the card, but not to rebate the $150 streaming credit, that how incompetent their team or system is, they preferred to reset and lose more money than go find out the issue).  When the FTC involved and demand them for answer, they chose the reset button instead of fixing the problem.  And when I have no other option since that\u2019s the only offer they offered me, they replied the government case resolved.  Self investment, they only know how to open and close accounts, any issues, good luck, they were like, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.  CD\u2019s interest rate is too low when compared to such high penalties (other banks either offer high interest with similar penalties, or similar interest with lower penalties).  It\u2019s not one off thing, it so many problems with so many of their different products.  Oh, their Alaska credit card, also don\u2019t offer travel protection, and you are required to use the card without travel protection in order to get the companion fare, and/or the free check in.  Alaska card is the only product that makes the special where no others offer (but Bilts partnership with Alaska Airline makes it no longer as exclusive as well), but always come with draw back.  Chase is simply better on everything that BoA isn\u2019t too bad of, and things that BoA maybe better than Chase, I can always find it better in Costco.  Maybe other banks are also offering subpar services now, or as bad.  But nevertheless, the CCR is still not a good option, USAR and USAC+ duo kill the CCR and Cash unlimited combos.

Not standardized, not trained, and not willing to resolve problem, also no follow up.  The business department is slightly better (I was Platinum Honor with personal and still a gold with business, that\u2019s the kind of relationship I have with them).

I have been with BofA for 20+ years, having held various accounts and credit cards, including mortgages, HELOCs and auto loans. I actually started with them when they were LaSalle Bank. I cant say I always had the most positive experience, but overall the expieinces I had weren't any worse than what I experienced with Chase.",

Online Shopping just looks at the Online flag and excludes certain MCCs like Utilities and Healthcare and stuff.\n\nSo a lot of purchases would code as two categories. HomeDepot.com is both Home Improvement and Online Shopping, DoorDash is both Dining and Online Shopping, etc."

I noticed that there was no SUB tracker under my CSP account on the Chase app so decided to give customer service a call. The first time I called (yesterday 6/20), they escalated my issue to the marketing team and I decided to wait 24 hours for an update.\n\nWith no update and after three rounds with customer service today, a supervisor decided it was an appropriate time to gaslight me. He told me that I agreed to a pop-up message stating that I was told if I want to proceed applying for the CSP, it would be with no SUB. I can promise you that there was no such pop-up and I even went in-branch today to talk to the bank teller who completed my application. She assured me that there was no such message and is going to see what's going on next week once her boss is back in the office.\n\nThe super condescending and rude supervisor also told me that \"last week\" a new anti-churning regulation came into play where ONLY ONE SUB is given for ANY Chase card every 48 months. I confirmed multiple times that I have never opened a Sapphire card and that this was indeed for ALL Chase cards (I opened a CFF in April of this year). I asked multiple times where the fine print regarding this new rule was, but he would condescendingly and continuously say \"\\[my first name\\], I assure you, you will not be getting the bonus no matter what\"\n\nThe whole ordeal with the supervisor left a terrible taste in my mouth and honestly would rather not do business with Chase again.

I have done bonuses before which I received as a new customer with Credit card issuers but I did not churn bonuses with the same company trying to get free cash.  I didn\u2019t keep some of those cards because there was no long term relationship to be had once the bonus was up based on the card offering.

            "So it's just for the Saphire family.\n\n\nIf you have CFF or CFU, you're safe.",
            "I have called four times at this point, one time even being in-branch in their conference room. All the same response...",
            "Same bro... got the CFU was waiting for the 5/24 to line up for me... Now 48 months \ud83d\ude2d",
            "I hope other banks don't follow Chase.",
            " I guess I'm the guinea pig :/",
            "I am fine with being denied a given card or even being denied a bonus provided it is something that was explicitly laid out in writing at the time of application.  SUB denial after the fact on the basis of some internal, unpublished rule is a different animal though.",
            "Even so, if true, the bank needs to provide disclosure.  Not accept the application, and the spend, and then retroactively apply a SUB restriction to an account.",
            ">even WF is denying perceived churners their new 4% card.\n\nI agree WF's underwriting for the Attune seems (from the admittedly limited DPs we've seen to date) unusually stringent... but it might be more WF being skittish about having uncapped 4% categories, and less about deterring churners. How many churners are really going to leap after the Attune for its $100 SUB?",
            "Yes, it is. Which is why I question the validity. \n\nGoing from the current language of 24/48 months to basically ONE SUB every 4 years across all Chase cards is too extreme.",
            "It would be a SUB every 4 years, so 2028 and 2032 :(",
            "Note this is not about the separate new Chase policy of offering their cards without a SUB, where previously they would have auto rejected the application. This is in the context of what OP\u2019s suggesting, that Chase limiting SUB to only once every 4 years across all its (core) cards and not just to single cards or card families like the Sapphire. So hypothetically, getting a freedom SUB blocks your Sapphire SUB for 4 years.\n\nIt would be shocking because despite being a money loser, the sapphire program has been a huge boost to the Chase brand. Jamie Dimon himself wished that they lost more money on the Sapphire as that would mean they won over more customers with more opportunities to cross sell.\n\nNow imagine if all the people who got into the Chase system with a freedom flex or unlimited early and then a year or two later decided to get the sapphire. They get told after their application that they are ineligible for a bonus because of a previous bonus on a completely different card. They would be furious.\n\nThe backlash and negative PR and brand damage would be big for Chase. Even Citi split the Premier from the Rewards+ so that their bonuses wouldn\u2019t conflict and rightly so because it\u2019s a penny wise and pound foolish gimmick. It saves a bit of money but can royally piss customers off that you actually want to bring in, I.e. the travelers and high spenders. Putting all the card bonuses under one family won\u2019t hurt churners since they\u2019d know to only cycle the high SUB cards, which is what people did with the Citi premier.\n\nI don\u2019t really doubt the OP\u2019s story per se, as any one can get screwed by any of these banks at any time. I just don\u2019t see this as a new strategy by Chase (without more data) and right after their elevated offers on the sapphires. I\u2019m inclined to think OP was somehow not eligible for SUB either by design or error and the CS explained poorly.",
            "Which part are you referring to, cause the 48 months Sapphire SUB rule has been around a long time.",
            "Chase phone reps are known morons, fyi.",
            "A $100 is $100.",
            "WF is clearly a bank that didn't do their homework on the BILT and is now probably sabotaging the Attune out of paranoia.",
            "Thats wild. Should I bail on the trifecta rush?",
            "I really hope this isn\u2019t true. I got the CFF couple weeks ago and just got approved for the CSP with 75k SUB. It better happen or I\u2019m gonna be pissed. Nowhere does it or did it say I wasn\u2019t eligible when applying",
            "I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s in reference to OP\u2019s unfounded (other than by known idiot Chase phone reps) claim that the 48-month rule now applies to all Chase apps rather than just Sapphires.",
            "Or they just want customers who are going to actually use the card, not optimizers who only used the card for rent and 5 other micro transactions to satisfy the requirements.",
            "I don\u2019t think what OP was told is true, I think the chase reps are misinformed.\n\nI opened CFU prob a year and a half ago, CFF like 6-7 months ago, and the CSP like a week ago. The tracker is up for my CSP and I\u2019m getting the SUB.\n\nThe people in charge of OPs case are not in the loop.",
            "Thanks for letting me know. I wouldn\u2019t be applying for a few months anyway, but I will keep a close eye on what\u2019s going on. Would be a pretty crazy move on Chase\u2019s behalf especially since they have to know that many people finish the trifecta in 1-2 years"
