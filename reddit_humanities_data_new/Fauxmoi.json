            "Lukewarm tea, but it seems like the main cast have  been acting in loads of plays this year. I saw Brian Cox in Long Day\u2019s Journey into Night - very eye-catching, Logan Roy vibe.

            "I have yet to see season 3 part 2, but from what I heard, they gender swapped a character to make place for a future same sex relashionship. And this was from one of the best and spiciest books of the series. Not sure that everyone agrees. I will reserve my judgment for when the story develops. \n\nThere is also a side story this year that absolutely no one care about. Like, not a single positive comment about that side story. \n\nFor the rest, I don\u2019t know, I have not been following much bridgerton drama.",
            "Yeah, between the gender swapped romantic lead for a future season, the side stories, the hunger games/capitol fashion, the lack of focus/screen time for the supposed main relationship, this season has made a lot of people really upset. I\u2019ve seen the whole season and while it\u2019s def the weakest of the 3 seasons, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the dumpster fire people are making it out to be. That all said, I did find part 2 hard to push through and the pacing and character arcs weren\u2019t great. Normally I can binge it no problem but on episode 6 I was like, \u201comg I STILL HAVE 2 more\u201d, I just wanted it to be over.",

            "The writing and editing were *bad*. Think GoT S8. I know there are other gripes, but the main complaint is that almost every department made poor creative decisions. The showrunner changed for this season so people think that was a major factor in things turning out poorly. The actors can only work with the material they get, so many people are disappointed after waiting two years to see fan-favourite couple Polin in the lead.  \nEdit: clarity",

            "They gender swapped a character who\u2019ll be a romantic lead in a future season so there is a lot of homophobia swirling around about that.\n\nDuring their introduction, they also changed something/insinuated something that will possibly drastically change part of the plot from the book. So there are people who don\u2019t care about the gender change but are upset about that change more.",
            "It was shit. Costumes, makeup, storylines and even dialogues didn\u2019t hit as two previous seasons. It\u2019s but hallmark now.",
            "Apparently there's something about how the old showrunner got pushed out? I'd love the details on that.",
            "Omg it\u2019s literally not as bad as everyone keeps screaming. But like there was just this massive build up of negativity and now they are nitpicking EVERYTHING. Like literally there was a post today about how someone cant handle Nicola\u2019s bad acting?!??! \n\nThere are some valid criticisms to this season but the reaction to the season is just insane. Multiple posts about the same topic all starting with\u201dis it just me or is this bad\u201d and some people have gone personal in particular with the male lead not being good enough, attractive enough, giving them the ick.",
            "Pacing was bad, scattered storylines, costumes and makeup changed. Colin got sidelined in his own season and had no character development at all. Some people are mad at the gender swapping of a character. But overall it\u2019s the writing that was the biggest issue for people. Like a lot happens in this season but it\u2019s all pretty boring, I personally skipped a lot of scenes",

In 2010 they did a film together, and her relationship broke down at the same time as the film.  She and Daniel were together by the end of 2010 and got married in 2011.

At this point there is allegedly 4 men in the cast with allegations against them most of which seem to be during college, the Instagram stories were made by two separate people one of which said that another one of the accused is a Carnegie Mellon alum of which there is multiple within the cast so that doesn't help narrow things down just encourages speculation. Neither of the posters are the victims or had any contact with them prior to posting and by the sounds of it the victims have asked them to take all the posts down it's an odd situation because now those who posted are saying they never consented to the posts being shared even thought their intent clearly was to make this info public as I said it sounds like the victims asked for it all to be taken down and that this all came out without their permission which makes me incredibly sad victims should always be the ones in control of what is made public about their experience and when. I've also read that there's a lawsuit being formed and I wonder if that's why the victims have asked for it all to be taken down as it could damage that the accused also apparently are lawyered up as is maybe the production itself who has known this whole time again also heard it's been that 2 cast female members bought up the allegations during the out of town try out and weren't asked to return when it moved to Broadway again all allegedly though. I have no idea what Angelina did or didn't know I would like to think that she didn't know and was kept in the dark by production she's promoted and attached herself to the show a lot by choice and I can't imagine she'd do that if she knew.

I've also heard it actually isn't that common for actors to take the show off after the Tony's especially for those who aren't really famous and as far as I saw there weren't any other lead actors out there day after and a reputable website had them both confirmed out all week I feel like it's more likely they realised it was drawing attention and went back on that decision than that it was completely unrelated but who knows!",

His security guards were MOUNTAIN-SIZED, and one was in front, one was behind, and I got pushed behind the lead and right into JT.  Seeing it as my only chance, I impulsively poked my elbow out and caught him.  It looked like the crowd was to blame, but my uncle understood what I'd done.

            "Barely. \n\nI checked her IMDB to corroborate my memory of this. She was on a religious WB drama and parlayed that into one small role in an Orion Pictures produced, awards\u2019 bait, indie drama called Ulee\u2019s Gold (starring Peter Fonda) in \u201897. \n\nShe followed that up with appearances in genre movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Blade: Trinity, and I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry. Not unsuccessful. But certainly not high profile mainstream acclaim. \n\nI would argue Evangeline Lily was the more successful actress to come out of network TV at the time, her star burned brighter because she debuted on a show that was considered more \u201crespectable.\u201d \n\nBiel would\u2019ve already faded into obscurity a couple times over were it not for her marriage to Timberlake. \n\nComparatively, Evangeline parlayed Lost into tenures in both Middle Earth and the MCU - and while she\u2019s not in the GREAT entries of any of those franchises (two minutes in Endgame shouldn\u2019t really count), that\u2019s still worth more than Biel\u2019s turns in failed relaunches of The A-Team and Total Recall, and TWO of Gary Marshall\u2019s godawful 2010\u2019s holiday movies. \n\nThinking about Biel and Lily, I must also cite arguably the most successful actress in their vein: Jennifer Garner. She debuted in small roles on TV (such as Spin City and Law and Order), parlayed that into small roles in film, (such as in Dude Where\u2019s My Car? and Pearl Harbour). Following this, she scored the lead in 2001\u2019s Alias, and parlayed that directly into both working with Steven Spielberg (2002\u2019s Catch Me If You Can) and into her roles in Daredevil/Elektra. Those appearances, in addition to Alias\u2019s success, led to Garner\u2019s appearance in 13 Going on 30, which - arguably more than Alias - built her a cult following, and she followed that with Juno, which brought critical acclaim and serious industry prestige.\n\nOf course, Garner also paired up with a much more famous, much more successful, male entertainer - but she continued to both headline her own projects (the ill-fated Elektra, for example) and work in movies of some substance over the years; for example, Dallas Buyers Club stands out to me as a particular success in her filmography, being nominated for multiple high profile industry awards, winning Matthew McConaughey Best Actor, and notably being released at a time when her contemporaries (Lily and Biel) were not working much.\n\nThat\u2019s wild to me, because there were a lot of roles in the 2010\u2019s that could\u2019ve gone to someone with Biel\u2019s track record. Between Blade, Total Recall, and The A-Team, she has some legitimate action cred. Why did she not end up headlining something in the spirit of Resident Evil, I do not know. Even if The Texas Chainsaw Massacre didn\u2019t exactly set her up like Ellen Ripley or Laurie Strode, she absolutely should\u2019ve been considered for roles like, for example, Olivia Wilde\u2019s part in Tron Legacy, or Olga Kurylenko\u2019s part in the Tom Cruise vehicle Oblivion.\n\nIt seems what her career needed was Alias. \n\nThe industry doesn\u2019t see her as a Star, they don\u2019t see her as a Lead, they don\u2019t see her as a dramatic actress, they don\u2019t see her as a comedienne, they don\u2019t see her as a viable action heroine, she doesn\u2019t have the WASPy, yet maternal, moneyed quality of Garner, or the sly steady self-assuredness of Lily. She didn\u2019t work in films that would build her a dedicated female audience (like Garner did), and her roles and films weren\u2019t high profile enough to endear her to a dedicated male audience (like Lily\u2019s did). It\u2019s a shame to say, but after nearly 30 years in the biz\u2019 she hasn\u2019t really distinguished herself. She\u2019s another fine actress with a pretty face. \n\nFrankly, at the risk of being overly vicious, I think the pinnacle of Jessica Biel\u2019s career was probably her playing herself in Bojack Horseman. Her willingness to play a comically evil version of herself was respectable. It\u2019s a shame I can\u2019t apply that word to anything else she\u2019s done in her career.",
