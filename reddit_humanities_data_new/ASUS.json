        "content": "Hi all,\n\nWas wondering if there were any tell tale signs that my bios or board might be failing. I am on bios 2613 and have been so since release. A month ago, I noticed I couldn't get into my PC. I used bios flashback and had a profile saved, so I recovered everything and chaulked it up to cosmic dust.  \n\nI shut down my PC every night. Just don't love having it on. \n\nTwo weeks ago, I lost my bios again. My computer would not boot at all, and I'd just see a solid green light coming from the LEDs of the board. I redid the steps of using the bios flashback, and all went well again. However the next morning, the issue reappeared. \n\nAnd I'm now in this situation here today - I can use my PC on EXPO I or EXPO Tweaked until I shut down my computer. When I turn the PC back on, my system's non-responsive and I can't even use the power button to turn off the system. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/niz7q9sw948d1.png?width=2267&format=png&auto=webp&s=19d6a91db2b1d450fb9237472cc3fa5535b2413a\n\nI'm pretty annoyed that I have to do this every time I want to use my PC. Is anyone aware of a fix? ",

Sometimes, the stutter is minimal and I can play but it is still noticeable. \n\nI would really appreciate some advice.\n\nMy laptop is an Asus ROG G16 (2023), the model is G614JI-AS94\n\nCPU: Intel Core i9-13980HX \nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070\nRAM: 16GB of DDR5-4800MHz (upgraded to 64gb from crucial)",
