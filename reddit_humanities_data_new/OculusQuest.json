        "content": "# Bi-Weekly Questions Megathread\n\nWelcome to the Bi-Weekly r/OculusQuest Community Q&A megathread!\n(Yes, we're still tweaking things :) )\n\n# Getting Started with Quest 3\n\n* **Charge**: Plug in your Quest to charge, so after everything is ready, you have plenty of battery!\n* **Account Creation**: Make your Meta account if you haven't already on the Mobile app.\n- **Game Gift Cards:** Meta has gift cards available at different retailers, depending on region.\n\n## Things to Avoid in VR\n\n* **Guardian**: Ensure you set your guardian in a spacious area with nothing to hit. Give a buffer for safety.\n* **Sunlight**: Protect the lenses from direct sunlight. It can damage the display.\n* **Sickness**: If you feel nauseated, take breaks. Pushing through might make things worse.\n* **Cleaning**: Use only microfiber cloths for the lenses, and avoid cleaning liquids. I use Koala Cloths, which you can [find here](https://www.amazon.com/Koala-Microfiber-Cleaning-Eyeglass-Computer/dp/B06X9V866C)\n\n## Game Recommendations for Quest (Standalone)\n\nCheck out [Gibby's Guide](https://gibbysguide.org/content/gibbysguidev24_lores.pdf)\n\n## Other Things to Do with Your Quest\n\n* **Other Stores**: Check out games on [Sidequest](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto) or [App Lab](https://www.applabdb.com/).\n* **Exploration**: Join friends on [Wooorld](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4360608937312293).\n* **Watching**: Enjoy 3D Movies on [Bigscreen](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2497738113633933/).\n* **Productivity**: Use Quest for work with apps like [Workrooms](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2514011888645651) or [Virtual Desktop](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2017050365004772).\n* **PCVR**: Play PC VR games if you have a [VR Ready PC](https://support.oculus.com/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/oculus-link-compatibility/).\n* **Improved Standalone Experiences**: Check out [Quest Games Optimizer](https://anagan79.itch.io/quest-games-optimizer). Be aware this does require Developer mode.\n\n## Playing PCVR with Quest\n\n* **Wired**: Use Oculus Link with a USB 3.0 cable.\n* **Wireless**: Play wirelessly using [Air Link](https://support.oculus.com/airlink/), [Steam Link](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/5841245619310585/), [Virtual Desktop](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2017050365004772/), or [ALVR](https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR).\n\n## Referrals\n\n* We currently advise to use [Meta-Dog](https://meta-dog.github.io/meta-dog/) as we don't allow referrals to be posted here.\nYou can learn more about the referral system meta provides [here](https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/app-referrals/).\n\n## Coming from a Quest 2?\n\n**Common Questions:**\n\n* **Will my Games work on Quest 3?**\nAny existing Quest 1 or 2 games will work fine, for PCVR most titles work perfectly out of the box.\n\n* **Why is my Quest 3 charging slowly?**\nThe stock charger that comes with the Quest 3 is a fairly low power charger, using another PD Charger 20w or above can help with charging speeds.\n\n* **What are some common problems with PCVR using Link on Quest 3 and how can I fix them?**\nCommon issues seen in our community are related to wireless issues, make sure you have a wired connection to a 5ghz or 6ghz router for best performance.\n\n* **How can I remove free apps from my library?**\nAt this time, Meta has not made this possible.\n\n* **Is there a way to increase the field of view (FOV) on the Quest 3, or make it more comfortable?**\nMake sure your fitment is right, you can find a guide [here](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/quest/articles/getting-started/getting-started-with-quest-3/adjust-fit-feel-quest-3/)\n\n* **How can I buy games on a discount for the Quest 3?**\nYou can wait for sales, get an app referral from a friend, or use Meta Dog for referrals.",

The FAQ says Virtual Desktops ($30, most features built into airlink?) and ALVR which I haven't looked into much.\n\n\nI Feel going Quest OS > Quest Link > Steam VR is a few steps that might be reducing performance (not really noticing it, just an annoying amount of loading screens before I can play a game)\n\nAlso any recommendations for experiences would be nice, I'm mostly playing things like driving games when in VR and have heard the original assetto corsa modded is one of the best experiences however I come from the age of modding Halflife and would be interested in seeing what kind of cutting edge experiments people have made available over polished but boring games.\nWhat's the VR equivalent of goku flying around de_rats?",

It was like sections of my left lense weren't syncing up with the rest of the image, like vertical and horizontal cuts where it desynced, sometimes giving me pixels.\n\nUsing the headset standalone I don't see that happening, really even wired I only saw it while playing. I've left it to charge for now as it arrived with 30% battery, but I wanna check if anyone more knowledgable knows what I'm missing, or if it could be the cable, perhaps even faulty hardware.\n\nI should add, I got a decent rig. GPU load was at 60% with the game on.",

            "When I tried the quest 2 before from a friend, on their meta quest app they had the option to record while casting. Alongside that feature was a feature to record live video feed side by side the quest 2's screen and the phone's camera. Another option was to somewhat green screen the person into the quest 2's recording using algorithms as it's not a full on green screen. When I got my quest 3, I don't seem to have that option. Can anyone help?",

When I'm recording a video in it or when I'm doing comms in standalone apps or games, my microphone sounds clear.\n\nWhen I'm on airlink on my PC, whether wired or wireless, the audio gets really choppy. Just an elongated \"aaaaaa\" will sound like \"aa--aa--aa\".\n\nI've seen other threads reporting the same thing, but I figured if other users have figured out how to stream stuff with the quest 3 with pcvr games then it's solvable right?\n\nI've tried enabling Hear VR Audio From Computer and Hear Computer Audio in VR, which was a Quest 2 fix but I figure I'd still try it. I've updated and reinstalled the drivers. Oculus app software is in the latest version. \n\nI used to own a Rift S, and whenever I plugged that on there was always a separate \"Rift S\" input that would sound better than the \"Oculus Virtual Audio Device\". Does that have anything to do with anything? I don't see a \"Quest 3\" input device and I don't think that's a thing.\n\nWould love to hear any ideas. I heard people using Virtual Desktop are having a better time but not by much.",

I don't even wear glasses!! It has been only FOUR weeks since I got it! The whole lens now is scratched and distorted \"hazy\". I very meticulously take care of my meta quest, I got a case for them and use a micro fibre cloth to clean them with a glasses rated safe cleaner. I am furious to find out that these lenses in this \"premium\" product are made of PLASTIC and not glass or even scratch resistant gorilla glass like on my iPhone, Apple Watch etc. How the engineering team was okay with the on a 3rd generation product make me livid. If I knew earlier that the lenses were cheap ass plastic and not scratch resistant, I would've purchased special lenses inserts immediately when I first got the product a few weeks ago. I spent almost $750 CAD, like come on man, for that price point and someone who takes care of his things I am nothing but disappointed. Even a soft CAMERA LENS rated carbon brush designed safely for lenses could not clean these. I am so disappointed, otherwise I loved my meta quest 3. I am going to contact meta support tomorrow and if they don't help it is straight return to Amazon Canada. I cannot be the only one with this issue eh? Anyone else have the same issue? Could it be mines had a defect and did not have the proper anti scratch coatings? I really do not know but I use my meta quest 3 for work and it is just super disappointing that I have to go through this hassle on a 3rd generation product that should be better polished and engineered.",

            "Dude, I have had the same issue and I don't even wear glasses!! It has been only FOUR weeks! The whole lens now is scratched and distorted \"hazy\". I very meticulously take care of my meta quest, I got a case for them and use a micro fibre cloth to clean them with a glasses rated safe cleaner. I am furious to find out that these lenses in this \"premium\" product are made of PLASTIC and not glass or even scratch resistant gorilla glass like on my iPhone, Apple Watch etc. How the engineering team was okay with the on a 3rd generation product make me livid. If I knew earlier that the lenses were cheap ass plastic and not scratch resistant, I would've purchased special lenses inserts when I first got the product a few weeks ago. I spent almost $750 CAD, like come on man, for that price point and someone who takes care of his things I am nothing but disappointed. Even a soft CAMERA LENS rated carbon brush designed safely for lenses could not clean these. I am so disappointed, otherwise I loved my meta quest 3. I am going to contact meta support tomorrow and if they don't help it is straight return to Amazon Canada. I cannot be the only one with this issue eh? Anyone else have the same issue? Could it be mines had a defect and did not have the proper anti scratch coatings? I really do not know but I use my meta quest 3 for work and it is just super disappointing that I have to go through this hassle on a 3rd generation product that should be better polished and engineered.",

While you do feel like you're looking through goggles sometimes, and the only AR you get is some low resolution black and white noise of your environment, years ago I never would've even dreamed of even being able to afford one of these, but having it be affordable for me made me cave in.\n\nYou still get immersed and forget you're standing on your living room looking silly. You still have fun. According to some friends the mic quality is impressive. And if you're not planning on doing much AR stuff, then you should be good overall.\n\nI mostly play in PC and it works flawlessly. SteamLink, a well charged heatset, wired LAN connection, and you're good to go.\n\nIf you want *more,* and you feel like you can save, probably Quest 3 is your pick. But Quest 2 has been doing decently for me so far.",

            "I just got the Quest 3 this week, so far it's pretty awesome. I've used the Quest 2 a lot at my stepdad's house, and I would say the Q3 is an improvement.\n\nBattery life seems comparable to Q2, probably about the same amount of time. I think the Q3 feels significantly more comfortable on the face, especially after long use sessions. The Elite Strap feels pretty cheap (just kind of flimsy plastic in areas), but it definitely gets the job done and I have no issues otherwise.\n\nI also thought the hand tracking was pretty great! Of course, it isn't as good as Apple's tracking, but Q3 is in a whole other ballpark. Considering the price of Q3, I find the hand tracking to be quite impressive. Pinching with your fingers to click can be kind of weird depending on the orientation of your hand (it can't always accurately determine the depth of your fingers), so I usually just bring the menus closer to my eyes and then use my fingers to click on things. Which is kind of more fun for me, personally.\n\nPassthrough is pretty good. Better than Q2, for sure. There is some warping occasionally, but it appears to happen more often when things are very close to the headset. If you put your phone directly in front of your face, it will warp a lot. But if you move back 6-8 inches, it looks normal, but you might not be able to read the screen (the brightness of your phone screen also plays a big part in this).\n\nThe depth camera is at least nice for setting boundaries. No more having to draw the boundary every time, you just look at the ground and it maps the boundary automatically.\n\nThe performance also feels like an upgrade. Just generally feels smoother, loads faster.. that kind of thing. So far, I have no regrets and I'm enjoying the Quest 3 a lot!",
            "You want all that for what, 300$? Good luck, those are features that would cost you 1500$ or more. And about battery - battery tech is in stagnation for what, 30 years now? While computing is going up and up. How would you pack better SoC, more memory, better cameras in a tiny package on your head and on top of that all components would have to be extremely power efficient.\n\nQ3 is a major improvement when compared to Q2 but is is an evolutionary step, not revolution.\n\nI'm actually surprised that it is sold this cheap. There is a lot of neat hardware in it, but you also need to pay for a better strap as default one is a joke. They had to cut costs somewhere, tho.",

        "content": "For those of you that know me pretty good on here, I'm not one that usually makes my own posts, I usually just reply on other peoples posts... But this is a special occasion.  I know a lot of us have been buying some of these \"greatly reduced in price\" games, but here is a bit of a heads up.   Over the past month I have bought probably 10+ games where I have to key in a promo code.. Then it reduces the price, the amount is deducted from my Quest Cash and its a done deal.\n\nHOWEVER... On 4 of my purchases they have done the following.. Take Mannequin for example.  Normally $20.. I bought it for half off.. So they took $10 from my Quest Cash.. Then they charged the rest to my Discover Platinum card.   One game .. Max Mustard, we all bought for $3 right?  Well they charged my Discover card $27.\n\nI rarely look at my credit card statements, but I happened to be looking for something entirely unrelated and then went down this rabbit hole.\n\nTL:DR ... Check to make sure they didn't charge you full price for some of these recent offers that involve entering a promo code.\n\nBefore anyone asks, yes I made sure the code was applied at checkout.  I'm in the US.  Its ONLY the ones where you manually have to type a code.  Not only is it on my credit card statement, if you go to your purchase history in the app, it shows it plain as day.   Max Mustard $3.00 Quest Cash  $27.00 Discover ending in ####.. Total price $30.00\n\nYes I've contacted support.  Yes most of my game purchases were fine.  Even the emailed receipts show the money being only removed from my Quest Cash and the rest is the discount amount.  But its sure in my purchase history and credit card bill.\n\nSo, heads up.. Been buying games for years and never had an issue.  I wouldn't have ever even noticed this.\n\nEDIT-  I do not blame any of the devs for this, but since a LOT of us bought Max Mustard, I reached out to the dev to make him aware.  Some of us were charged full price, some of us it just looks like we paid full price, and some had no issues at all.  \n\nEdit 2.. Its not just games you had to enter a promo code for.. I just saw that I got charged the same way with both Contractors Showdown and Stride Fates.  Those were on just a normal sale I think..  Edit to this edit.. Stride Fates I bought in March, and Contractors Showdown I got in May.  How long has this been a thing?\n\nLuckily, most people seem to just have the weird shit showing up on their meta stuff, but were not charged.  But some, like me, have been.   I will keep updating as I hear things.  This wasn't to start a panic, or cause people to grab their pitchforks.. Its just a \"heads up\" to my Quest peeps!",

            "You had me check. All of my recent 90% games were fine except for Max Mustard. That one shows the full price charged to my card for $29.99 on the purchase history on the Meta app only. I just checked my bank account as I got that earlier in the month and I was only charged the $3.00 for it. All the others were fine as well. You have me a little paranoid now though because all the other games only show their correct discount price. But not max mustard, it showed full price in the meta app but charged me like normal for the $3. Weird",
            "I think you might be right. I just checked my history and it\u2019s charged for 30 dollars for Max Mustard. I used the code, and it was definitely 3 dollars. I\u2019ve got to look into it further.",
            "So far for me on PayPal are 3 transaction of meta, all matching the final low price of 2 or 3 dollars per game.\n\nMy bank statements for my card also reflects that so I'm OK.\n\nHowever thanks for this post, with meta you never really know.",
            "~~You know what, I wonder if this issue happens with other promotions. Back when they were offering an extra 25% off for a bundle of 3 games, I got charged more than expected. I thought that it was just because I miscalculated, but maybe there is some fine print here...yeah I got charged full price for Max Mustard as well.

Man this is actually really bothering me now~~\n\nEdit 2: So looking through my actual PayPal statement, the extra charge that appears in my Meta purchase history is not actually there. It appears to be some artifact of the meta platform, and I have not actually been charged full price for Max Mustard. I don't know why it did that for Max Mustard but not the other games...",

I don't think I ever heard of them needing to take $30, but only taking $3 \"by mistake\". These \"mistakes\" only seem to happen in one direction.\n\nEdit: Yep, appears I've been defrauded. The order confirmation email says $3, but they took $30. At least that's what Meta account history is showing. I'll check credit card statement tomorrow, but it doesn't look good.

So I got my Quest 3, got the $200 knocked off the bill, then paid it off in one payment.\n\nBut then I knew I fucked up and should have got the 512 GB version.. So I used my platinum card that I keep for big emergencies lol.  So at least I figured that out.  I thought I got hacked or something.",

I don't even know wtf it is now.  Its locked in one of my safes , but I think its Discover It card or some shit.  Its just a saying around the house when something big breaks..

Its just a fuck up somewhere.   Before I got into hospital management, I had a pretty solid sales and marketing background and I think someone else here already said what I'm going to say but .. If you have a product that costs next to nothing to make, and you price it at $20, its hard to get someone to buy it.  But if you take that price and knock it down to $3, you are probably going to sell the shit out of it, and an inventory check will reflect its a \"best seller\".\n\nI also wanted to point out that you reminded me of myself the way you ended that response.  Usually my first group email in the morning will say something like \" I hope that made sense.. I'm still tired/not awake/not had my morning coffee\".

Long story short, that \" mechanical \" gene that most men seem to be born with, skipped me apparently.  I had a really nice push mower that quit working 4 years ago, and a weed eater broke last year.  Instead of just buying new ones or getting my neighbor to fix them.. I learned how to do it myself.\n\nNow my neighbor has brought me 2 broken mowers for me to fix.. I got one working already and a guy going to buy it tomorrow.  Little money on the side for shits and giggles.    The 2nd one is a self propelled one and when I get it working, I'm going to shine it up and give it to this old man I always see mowing his lawn and pushing his mower up the slight hill his house sits on.\n\nI do a lot of community outreach and charity work.. Its just me.  Fuck.. I am Ambien talking aren't I.  Damn that pill either knocks me out or makes me never shut up..  I won't remember typing any of this.  Imma shut up now."

            "My version and runtime are both v66. OS version is \"sq3a.220605.009.a1\" whatever that means, and warping is still pretty bad. If Meta is really rolling this warping fix out via a secret mini update to select random random users, then that's really dumb. Just let everyone who paid for the product enjoy the update at the same time.",
            "I just got v66 and remember thinking 'what was it again they changed in this update?'\n\nLovely improvement ... like being healthy, not something one notices actively when it's there... :)",
            "While the warping (especially) along depth discontinuities is impressively reduced, it also shows the - sadly inevitable - tradeoff: the perspective error is significantly higher at close range. \n\nAnd to be honest, at least for me it makes close-range interaction like reading your phone feel...off.",

Some people have reported getting v66 but not the warping update, you need version, runtime version, and OS version to be on v66 before it's **fully** updated, it takes time to roll out completely\n\n[4K video here for anyone who wants to pixel peep!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4__FQokUijg)",
            "Had a discord friend send me video of his update 2 nights ago. He took his phone and filmed through the lens while looking at his TV in his living room. He then pulled the headset away, allowing the phone to focus on the TV without looking through the lens, and then brought it back and allowed the phone to refocus on the TV through the lens. The transition was butter smooth and had zero warp. I will ask him if he's ok with me posting it in this comment(he's made several comments about being anti-reddit and I don't want to post without his permission) \n\nBut, it was amazing how much it was improved. Meta is working some black magic into this headset. It's wild.",

            "I got v66 yesterday.  Went through the whole install and then rebooted to finish and was disappointed to see warping hadn't changed.\n\nDecided to give the headset another reboot, just in case, and sure enough when it came back up warping had virtually disappeared.\n\nSo, yeah, if you haven't rebooted your headset recently, give it a shot.",

I ordered bobovr s3 pro, took off facial interface and i will never go back. I can play for 2+ hours without any discomfort.\n\nWhat I noticed, is you will need a headstrap with battery to balance the weight of quest 3. You can remove battery from s3 pro (it\u2019s on magnets) but it\u2019s not as comfortable as playing with battery on the back.",

I think the OS version is handled by meta's servers, this is the one that you need to wait for before the passthrough warping is fixed, as they're handling it on a server-side basis.\n\nall other features of the v66 firmware though should be included in v66 after installation.",

            "What does that mean",
            "If it was too much, I wouldn't use it like this. It depends on what you want to do - if you want to play Eleven Table Tennis at a very high level and run 4 meters in a different direction every second, the stability is too low. If you want to use it normally for most things, then it's okay. It really depends on the head strap, for example Bobovr S3 is much better than M3 for using without face interface.",
