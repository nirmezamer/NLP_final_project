            "With the update to clue scrolls staying on the ground for an hour, if you get a clue scroll from a birdhouse, you can drop it before looting the next birdhouse for a chance at another clue. If you get one, you can do it after the birdhouse run and then pick up your first clue after.\n\nIf you do double birdhouse runs where you bring enough for two full trips and log out at the southern birdhouse, it's around 2 seconds faster to loot the south birdhouse, tele back to your POH, and use a mounted digsite pendant to go back and check the first three birdhouses, instead of running all the way back north.\n\nIt's even faster by a few more seconds if you use a regular digsite pendant and skip the POH, though this might not be worth it if you're early game and struggling to upkeep rubies."

The engagement with others as they blow by me on traps has been nice, but I imagine having an instance will make traps slightly more consistent for experienced folks",

The biggest benefit of a shadow is the insane accuracy and you've already got that. Enjoy! I'm jealous",
