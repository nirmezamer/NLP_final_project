        "content": "Hello r/resumes \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI'd like to talk about a topic that is just outside of the normal scope of this sub (i.e., resumes), and that is job search.\n\nWith the recent layoffs that have happened in recent months, there will surely be a lot of folks out looking for jobs, many of which may be hitting a brick wall at various points of the job search process, such as:\n\n* Not getting call backs\n* Not passing the recruiter screen\n* Not moving forward during job interviews\n\nBelow, I'll talk about each of the above issues and provide some ideas as to why you may not be seeing the results you want.\n\n# First pain point - not getting any callbacks (or getting very few)\n\nIf you're getting less than **1 callback in every 10 job applications**, it's an indication that one of a few things is happening:\n\n* You're not qualified for the types of jobs you're applying to\n* Your resume isn't presenting a relevant value proposition\n* Job market (out of your control)\n* Strength of other candidates (out of your control)\n* If you're a student or new grad looking to apply for internships and jobs abroad, a common obstacle is the lack of sponsorship for visas. Many companies are hesitant or unable to sponsor visas due to the complexity and cost involved. This can significantly reduce the pool of opportunities available to international candidates, making it even more challenging to secure a callback.\n\n**Fixes:**\n\n* To make sure you're qualified, you should be checking off at least 60% of the requirements of the role.\n* If you're qualified, there's a good chance it's your resume. Most people's resumes contain mistakes that fall into one of three categories: improper formatting for ATS, generic content, or not enough personalization/customization. I provide more info about each of these in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/tq061t/biggest_mistakes_that_impact_your_resumes/) and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/s2b37q/if_youre_applying_online_use_a_single_column/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1).\n* For international students and new grads, do your research and target companies and roles that have historically sponsored visas or are known to be more open to international candidates can improve your chances. Additionally, being upfront about your need for sponsorship can help set the right expectations from the start.\n\n# Second pain point - not making it past the recruiter screen\n\nIf you're getting calls from recruiters, but aren't making any progress after that, then there's something going on with what you're telling (or not telling) them.\n\n**Some Potential Causes and Fixes - Recruiter Screen**\n\n|Possible Cause|Fix|\n|:-|:-|\n|Your elevator pitch is unsatisfactory|Practice your pitch and ensure it aligns with what the company is looking for in this particular role. Your pitch should essentially answer these questions: Who are you and why do you want this job?|\n|What you're saying doesn't match what's on the resume|Memorize your resume and everything on it, including titles, dates, and responsibilities.|\n|You're asking for too much money (if you've revealed your salary expectations).|Don't reveal your salary expectations at this stage. If asked, just say that you'd like to learn more about this position before you can provide a realistic salary expectation. Do your homework on salary range for your position, industry, and company.|\n|You're not prepared, haven't done your research, don't seem enthused for the role etc.|There are a lot of other applicants. If you don't seem like you want the job, they'll move on. To prevent this: research the role/company and develop a good understanding of what they do (i.e., their market, products, services etc.). Look at company pages, read their mission statement, read the job description, show up on time, and try to sound neutral at the very least (excited would be good).|\n\n*Note: These are just common causes that may be behind your results. This isn't an exhaustive list and there could be other reasons not covered here.*\n\n# Third pain point- you're not moving forward during interviews with hiring managers\n\nGetting roadblocked during the interview stage likely means you're not performing well enough.\n\n**Common Causes and Fixes - Interview**\n\n|Possible Cause|Fix|\n|:-|:-|\n|You're not sufficiently answering behavioural interview questions|Practice! There are a lot of good guides all over the internet on this topic. See a brief guide to these questions below this table.|\n|You can't remember important details about past projects and accomplishments|Prepare a master list of projects and accomplishments you've been involved in throughout your career. Follow the STAR format. Memorize it.|\n|You're lacking key skills and experiences.|If you know you lack key skills/experiences, you'll need to provide a very good rationale for why you'd still be the right candidate for the position. If you don't have one, you probably shouldn't apply.|\n\n*Note: These are just common causes that may be behind your results. This isn't an exhaustive list and there could be other reasons not covered here.*\n\n# A note about behavioural interview questions\n\nEmployers love using behavioural questions because they give them a little bit of insight into how you'd behave in a particular role, how you'd react in a particular scenario, or how you'd solve a particular problem or task. They're also really hard to fake.\n\nA few common ones you've probably heard before:\n\n* \u201cTell me about a time when...\u201d\n* \"How would you approach X problem...\"\n* \"Imagine you're in the following situation...\"\n\nAnswering these questions is beyond the scope of this post today, but if you're struggling with these types of questions, you'll need to prepare and practice in order to respond effectively.\n\n# A note about the STAR Method\n\nYou've probably heard of this before, but for those of you that haven't, the STAR method is a simple and easy-to-remember technique for answering behavioural interview questions. STAR stands for:\n\n1. Situation: Describe a specific situation or event where you faced a challenge or had to solve a problem. Try to pick a relevant example that shows your skills and abilities.\n2. Task: Explain the task or responsibility you had in that situation. What were you supposed to accomplish or what goal were you trying to achieve?\n3. Action: Talk about the actions you took to address the situation or complete the task. Explain the steps you took and the skills you used to resolve the issue or meet the goal.\n4. Result: Share the results of your actions, focusing on the positive outcomes and what you learned from the experience. This could include how you improved a process, solved a problem, or achieved a goal.\n\n# Hopefully these tips help you!\n\nThis isn't a comprehensive guide by any means, but it can hopefully give you some ideas and point you in the right direction if your job search isn't getting you the results you want.\n\nGood luck!\n\nPS: If you found this post helpful, consider subscribing to my free newsletter, [The Launchpad](https://thecareerlaunchpad.beehiiv.com/subscribe), where you\u2019ll get weekly tips to help you network, find jobs, and make more money (not to mention the the freebies).

In this kind of market, networking becomes a crucial factor:**\n\nIf you're not networking already, you should be doing so.\n\n**A few basics about networking:**\n\n* It's not just for executives. Anybody can do it.\n* It's not just for extroverted people. If you're an introvert, you can still network.\n* It can be done online, or in person. Pick your poison.\n\n**Important groups in your network:**\n\n* Family\n* Friends\n* Coworkers\n* Alumni\n* Recruiters\n* Everyone else\n\n**Examples of how you can network:**\n\n* Asking a friend or family member over coffee if their company is hiring for your job type and if so, would they be open to referring you.\n* Reaching out to a LinkedIn acquaintance whose content you regularly engage with, to ask whether they know of any opportunities for X job type.\n\n**Networking works best if you do it regularly**\n\nIt works a lot like a garden. If you only tend to it once or twice a year, it's going to wither and die.\n\nYou should be tending to it regularly.\n\nNetworks are the same way. They're built on relationships - and like any relationship, if you only reach out when you need something, you're going to fail.\n\nBuild and maintain your network - think longterm.\n\nI hope this helps some of you.

            "I wish more people would read the stickys. ~90% of the posts would be solved. \n\nOne interview trick that I do that helps me get to the next round is just have a conversation with them. Treat it less like an interview and more like a coffee meetup. For example, at the beginning of the interview, before we actually start, ill ask them how they're doing, if they had a great weekend or plan on doing anything exciting this up coming weekend, etc. The \"interview\" feels more authentic and maybe if they say something that you like or are familiar with, touch on that for a bit. Boom, now you're best friends with recruiter. \n\nAlso ask more open ended questions during the interview to get them explain things more in detail. Shows that you're curious and also gives you more time to think. For example, ill say something like \"what's a previous project [goal, KPI, etc] that the team completed as it relates to X\"",
            "*You're not prepared, haven't done your research,* ***don't seem enthused for the role etc.***\n\nTHIS. \n\nI interview so many good and qualified candidates who totally fail to indicate in any way that they are actually interested in the company/role. Literally say during the interview:\n\n\"I am excited about what \\[X Company\\] is doing in the \\[Y industry\\] space!\" \n\n\"I am excited about what I can contribute to your team!\" \n\n\"I am excited to help with the challenges you are facing!\" \n\n**Be overt with your enthusiasm.**",

Going through your checklist:\n\n* Qualifications - without lying to myself, I'm confident that I have the qualifications to perform the jobs I apply to. Maybe for 10% of apps I might have be stretching a bit, but I think probably still meeting 50% or more qualifications\n* Improper ATS formatting - I always submit as a PDF in a single column, fairly straightforward format. It's actually the same one you shared in another post [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wdkgpgU7lFoV801ysrBn8qrPaIpyUsUH/mobilebasic)\n* Generic Content - I make sure to have >50% of my bullet points tied to a metric, such as throughput %'s, $$'s saved, etc.\n* Not enough personalization - I don't know if my \"bland\" resume format so I don't get kicked by the ATS is hurting here, but I will say at first glance it probably does look pretty dense or packed together\n\nMy best guesses is I'm either\n\n1. Overestimating my qualifications/underestimating what's posted for the job\n2.

            "This is a super helpful guide. Thank for putting it together; it's very thorough!\n\nOne quick note about: \"*you're asking for too much money (if you've revealed your salary expectations). \u00a0Don't reveal your salary expectations at this stage.\"*\n\nThis one is tricky. As someone who has sat in the seat of both agency and internal corporate recruitment for mid to enterprise (F500 companies), having that alignment on salary at the initial stages is really important. Companies have salary bands and recruiters work with ranges that are provided by the companies they are supporting that is one of the tools that they use to filter out candidates. Doesn't seem fair, but it's just a reality. Not giving a salary can exclude you as a candidate because recruiters need to know what you want to ensure they can make it work for you and them (financially) and they need to establish this before moving forward. This way, no one wastes their time. The worst thing that can happen is that you go through various stages of interviews only to find out that the compensation offered is not in line with what you are hoping for. \n\nAdditionally, when a candidate says \"I'd like to wait etc.\" this also raises a flag because, to your point above, on the flipside a candidate can change their salary expectations later on in the process. This is something that companies worry about.\n\nA couple of options:\n\n1. Ask what the salary range is that the company has budgeted for this position. In this day and age, if a company is reluctant to share this I'd be concerned. With all the Pay Transparency initiatives taking effect, there's been an increasing number of job postings that show salary range. So, ask before you answer.\n\n2. Be honest and ask for what you want and do it confidently. Don't give a set number give a range that leaves wiggle room for negotiation and a range that you are comfortable with. I understand that this may be easier said than done and not all of us able to advocate for ourselves in the same way. So, this is where researching the company the position comes in. Do your research and see what the market is offering for the position you're applying for. Look for ranges within different industries and most importantly find a range that works for you; one that you are really asking for. \n\nAt the end of the day, it will depend on the candidate and the company. There are also some companies that would be okay to wait, but hopefully this provides an alternate perception that can help in various situations.\n\nThanks again OP for this. Really great post.",

            "I see your point, but I don\u2019t think the two are necessarily mutually exclusive. \n\nIf every single job applicant, everywhere, got calls on 10% or more of their applications, then yes, that would suggest that recruiters call 1 in 10 applicants or more.\n\nHowever, that isn\u2019t the case. Let\u2019s take a look at it from a different angle, using some examples. \n\nImagine we have Lily, a job seeker, who applies to three different jobs: Job A, Job B, and Job C. Lily has an impressive resume, and she consistently gets calls for 10% or more of the applications she submits.\n\nNow, for Job A, the recruiter calls 5 out of 50 applicants (including Lily). In this case, the recruiter contacts 1 in 10 applicants.\n\nMoving on to Job B, the recruiter calls 15 out of 100 applicants (Lily\u2019s one of them, too). Here, the recruiter actually contacts more than 1 in 10 applicants, which is 15%.\n\nFinally, for Job C, the recruiter calls 10 out of 200 applicants (yep, Lily gets a call here as well). This time, the recruiter contacts fewer than 1 in 10 applicants, around 5% to be exact.\n\nSo, what we're seeing here is that the percentage of applicants contacted by recruiters can vary quite a bit, even when Lily consistently gets calls for 10% or more of her applications. There's no one-size-fits-all rule that applies to every job, recruiter, or applicant out there.\n\nLily\u2019s experience might make it seem like recruiters always call at least 1 in every 10 applicants, but that's not a hard and fast rule. It's just how things played out for her and the specific jobs she applied to. I hope this helps! \n\nAs for where the metric came from, it\u2019s based on my own experience on TA and coaching.

Include a section at the top of the page for a summary. That's where you want to put the little blurb that you have before each bullet point. Ideally, the summary comes first to, well, summarize your skills, achievements, past roles and what career goals you hope to achieve with this company. The experience section should just be the job title, company, start and end date, and at least 3 bullet points that highlight HOW you helped that company. Look up the STAR method. Not only will it help on your resume but also during interviews.\n\n  \n3. You're going to want to include keywords from the job description. Yes, that means that you should be tweeking your resume each time you send it out. Scan the job listing to see what words you need to use on your resume.

Everything else is not needed.\n\nFor Projects, this may be a matter of personal preference, but I\u2019d like to see a couple of sentences explaining what the outcome of the project is in layman\u2019s terms, and then a separate line the begins with \u201cTechnology Used:\u201d, followed by a list of all the languages, frameworks, APIs, etc used to build the project.\n\nCertifications: I already mentioned.\n\nAwards & Achievements: No notes.\n\nOverall notes on formatting:\n- Don\u2019t underline your headings. Your resume has quite a few links, so underlined formatting everywhere else confuses the eye.\n- Make your left and right margins even and at least 0.35\u201d (though 0.5\u201d would be better).\n- Increase the indent of your bullets.\n- Make the font size of your section headings slightly bigger than the rest of your text, and make sure the size of the rest of your text is no smaller than 10pt.\n- Play around with line spacing options to add more white space in each section. White space makes it visually less daunting and easier to consume.\n- You probably could get this done in one page, but don\u2019t worry if it\u2019s more than one page. Just make sure that if the page breaks in the middle one work experience, one project, or any of the smaller sections, you move that content to the second page.\n\nYou\u2019re an absolute star, and I wish you luck, though once you update your resume, you probably won\u2019t need it!",

            "Managers are busy. They don\u2019t want a story book to review a potential candidate",
            "Shorten everything. Use only keywords (google: resume keywords). Try to have different resume versions for example a \u201csales\u201d resume, \u201cmanagement\u201d resume, \u201ccustomer service\u201d resume. In each one, keep the experience and education relevant to the \u201ctheme\u201d. this will keep them shorter too. You can choose your own themes depending on the areas you excel on. That being said, memorize everything youre deleting because you should be able to expand on all the points on your resume",
            "I\u2019ve read several of the comments and I\u2019m not sure I agree that two pages is the solution. The last two sections should either be left off or condensed down by removing the details. Once you\u2019ve done that, you\u2019ll have room to adjust the formatting on the important sections remaining. I\u2019ve read many hundreds of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and two pages is fine, but I personally believe the more information you provide, the more it should directly relate to the position you\u2019re applying for and not just be fluff. Good luck OP!",
            "Idk if it helps but the margins seem off, maybe you can increase them a little, the ATS will still detect your KW\nAs it\u2019s been said before, try to reduce by a lot everything unrelated to the job description/relevant to the field you\u2019re applying to",
            "Your margins are too slim/text is too wide, it takes away your other formatting and readability \n\nRemove the underlines for non-bold items\n\nActually remove all underlines. Just have bold or maybe italics for position names.\n\nI implement a style I refer to as cascading text. Make the company line the biggest text, and cascade to slightly smaller text for bullets and everything underneath. Decrease by 0.5 font each line. It makes the resume visually flow better. For example :\n\nProfessional experience (bold/11 font)\n\nCompany name and  position held (italics/10.5 font)\n\nBullets (regular text/10 font)\n\n\nYou need to adjust the sizing and features but I think it would greatly improve this",
            "If i were hiring, i wouldnt like how you describe your current job. I know recruiters say 'quanitify everything' but that seems like bullshit to me. Theres no way to quantify most things without just making some shit up and hoping whoever youre saying it to is too dumb to understand you made it up. Problem is that the final layers of hiring staff are not dumb enough to fall for it. You might trick the recruiter into passing your resume along, but when a person who works with data gets to see it, they will be more confused than impressed. They might think you made up the '20% increase in data quality'. especially since you just chose 20 instead of a number that would make more sense like 18.76% or something that could come from a real analysis of company data. They may think you made up the 95% accuracy in auditing machine learning data, especially because its not obvious what any of that means. are you auditing training dataset? outputs from tests? outputs during prod? What exactly are you describing here? How did you determine the failure rate to come to this accuracy rate? If you dont know the exact number and how to prove it, just dont say a number.",

You always included what you're most proud of. Now competition is thick (especially in your industry) and everyone is too busy to bother with the hiring process. You assume you get 30 seconds of your hiring manager's time and you need to wow them by only saying the right things; target so that when you submit this resume to this job it says you can do the job. Formatting wise, education only goes on top when you have nothing else. Content wise, say less; you're saying what's most important to you not what needs to be said. For example, each of your award titles doesn't require a description also.",
