            "\u201cIdentity\u201d is a useful fiction that allows us to categorize our experiences so they are easier to conceptualize. It\u2019s a heuristic\u2014a logical shortcut. \n\nPeople have desires and degrees of desires about other people, genitalia, their ideal social role, their presentation, and everything else under the sun. People have habits that are inherited, borrowed, imprinted, and learned. People look tall, short, dark, fair, disabled, thin, fat, hairy, and muscular. We change, we grow, we become new people again and again as life shapes us. These are attributes that we all live with by virtue of being alive and human. \n\nSome attributes have been cast as unnatural or undesirable, diminishing the quality of life for those who possess those attributes. This rejection creates identities around possession or non-possession of these attributes, as a normative system associates one\u2019s value in all respects as contingent upon which traits they do or do not possess. In response, communities form around the discriminated attributes for the purpose of effecting social and/or political change. \n\nIn this way, the identity group formed by the normative group is used as a means of organizing to undermine the structures of discrimination, but in the process runs the risk of affirming the narrative that these identity groups point to a real distinction between people with and without these attributes. The final step of a movement against discrimination lies not in equality between groups, but in the abolition of the groups entirely.\n\nOf course, there is a real difference between people who are attracted to those of the same gender and those of other genders. There is also a real difference between someone with blonde hair and someone with black hair. \n\nThe human experience is messy, and complicated, and wonderfully unique. We can\u2019t possibly hold all that in our heads at once: we\u2019re only human, after all. Identity groups provide boxes to sort the clutter into, but we misrepresent reality if we hold any specific arrangement of identity categories as natural and without exception. \n\nMy point being: exclusion and inclusion ought to be functional. As an example, straight men should not be signing up for a men\u2019s-only speed dating night, not because they should be banned from a gay-only event by virtue of their straightness, but because they won\u2019t be able to participate in the purpose of the event and will frustrate others involved in the event. Along these lines, I fail to see how identification with the label \u201cqueer\u201d by someone who doesn\u2019t fit the usual criteria is harmful in itself.",
            "Actually I'm on Fetlife and have seriously thought about identifying as genderfluid and heteroflexible to fit in. I feel very alien in the community for a variety of non-gender-related reasons. It would be so easy, I wouldn't even need to change my pronouns, not that I care about being identified as gender neutral in the first place. You outright have people joking they won't fuck anyone who isn't at least a little queer. Which is fine, it's a joke, still I already feel hopeless because I'm a depressed fuck and a devil on my shoulder tells me its a way I could increase my chances. I know it's that personality that's what is really limiting me but I'm stuck in it.\n\nI wouldn't though. Morals of lying aside, it's too close to the people that still call me the f-slur for being weird or having long hair or whatever being right. I don't feel not male. I like being a man, even though I don't like how us cis men treat each other. I also don;t have any desire to do stuff with masc folk so heteroflexible doesn't really work.\n\nI agree with anarchopuppy, you can't just clearly classify people on a murky spectrum that everyone is confused about. It's just wild to be a step from the person they're talking about and hear \"that person doesn't exist, they woudl just claim they're homosexual. Like no right-wingers know the word \"genderfluid\" by this point. Hell, I saw a screenshot from 4chan awhile back where a guy said he enabled non-binaries on his tinder so he could bang \"hot tomboys\". Tell me you're 100% certain that guy wouldn't lie and say he's any kind of queer just to get some they/them pussy. \n\nugh, I feel dirty writing this, but I can't talk to anyone about it so there you go reddit.

To be fair a few dating sites kinda killed that side of me too, but I distanced myself more and more from the community the more I found things gatekept. And it\u2019s not just this. I couldn\u2019t use anything rainbow spectrum colored in my art or clothes even though it\u2019s my favorite color scheme without my overly conservative religious parents freaking out and claiming I was making \u201cpride content\u201d. I just never told them I was bi at the time and hid that, but what\u2019s funny is the rainbow is also heavily used to represent autism and other neurodivergent groups (I *am* autistic, at least) that have some overlap but aren\u2019t synonymous. And I wish I could tell you the number of times I have witnessed someone call the use of rainbow colors in other things \u201cpride appropriation\u201d when, I\u2019m sorry, but the rainbow can be used for other things. I know that sounds crazy but if you\u2019re going to appropriate something in the first place don\u2019t gate keep other people from using it too. \n\nIt gives the same vibe as if someone in america tried to claim they earned the exclusive right to \u201cred white and blue\u201d, because \u201cwe earned our flag\u201d, like, no, a thousand countries use those colors. And this whole damn country was built on theft and unfair graves and mistreated minorities. We shouldn\u2019t be proud of our flag or its colors at this point, at least the pride flags stand for something good and beautiful and kind. Or at least they should.\n\nI tried to be a part of the community. I tried to find my place in it. I really did genuinely feel that I was bi at the time, but a community I was told was built on allowing people to explore themselves, and be proud of who they are, a place of inclusiveness and understanding and acceptance, a welcoming place, gatekept the fuck out of me. I genuinely hope that other people on their own journeys of self discovery have a better experience and meet better LGBTQ+ people than I did. But at this point, it doesn\u2019t seem to matter where I try to belong, people will always make sure I know I don\u2019t belong there. \n\nIt didn\u2019t matter when I was exploring being bi, and eventually shifted to heteroflexible, and then just demi after years of being treated like I \u201cdidn\u2019t count\u201d. I\u2019ve ironically never had my sexuality be questioned and disrespected and had my boundaries and \u201cwhat I like and don\u2019t like\u201d be stepped on and ignored more, than when I was in the LGBTQ+ community. With people like my parents, I simply decided it wasn\u2019t their business. (They\u2019ve never really been people I could count on or trust anyway so this wasn\u2019t exactly that much more severe of a blow to me. I am truly sorry to the people who actually love their parents and are truly hurting from the fact that their parents don\u2019t, or wouldn\u2019t accept them if they knew. I can only imagine your pain.) \n\nEven when I was heteroflexible (basically just, bi but doubting if I was actually bi anymore) the final nail in the coffin for me was seeing the \u201cheteroflex\u201d \u201cflag\u201d be basically the bi flag but mostly monochrome and colorless? Giving this heavy implication of \u201csuperiority, we\u2019re colorful you\u2019re not, you are a colorless traitor and only we can be colorful.\u201d It was what finally killed it for me I think. I still love my friends in the community and support their relationships wholeheartedly. To me, love is just love. If I see a healthy relationship, I support it. \n\nMy best friend and his boyfriend are like, genuinely, probably one of the best pairings I know. I think pride month absolutely should be celebrated for the fact that it has been a long hard fight to be treated remotely as people that deserve to exist in this world, because *god* you all do. So much. But people really need to start remembering the line between proud of who you are, and \u201csecretly insecure so you feel like you have to put others down to remain proud of who you are\u201d. You deserve more than that. Be proud to be LGBTQ+, because it\u2019s worth being proud of. Not because you\u2019re \u201cbetter\u201d, or \u201cmore colorful\u201d than someone else, not because it\u2019s \u201csomething unique\u201d, but because it\u2019s a part of who *you* are, and you *should* be proud of the things that make you, you. Be proud of what and who you love, and let that include, you. But please, don\u2019t do this \u201cI must shove other people out who don\u2019t belong\u201d thing.

On purely conceptual ground, there *can't not exist* a criteria for queerness, otherwise queerness and non-queerness would be identical and thus \"being queer\" would be meaningless.
