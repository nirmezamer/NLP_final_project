That move would be quite illegal in Germany, people here also think indicating grants them the right of way. Thats not the case, we ve got the rule that the person who's already in the lane has the right of way (\u00a7 7 Abs. 5 StVO). Exceptions being of course stuff like zipper merging and courtesy.\n\nFunny to see the differences.",

            "Unsure if it's a cultural difference but I'm surprised so many think crossing two lanes in such quick succession, forcing people to hit their brakes and trying to ram yourself into a gap rather than looking for a gap safely is considered good/safe driving.\n\nIn this case I can't even understand why it was done. Usually a manuever like that is done when someone needs to come off but they've left no time to cross the lanes... \n\nBut that's oncoming traffic, so I have no clue why it was so desperate to get into that lane. Absolutely no benefit for the driver.",

            "That\u2019s right. Some people need to learn how to drive safe.",
            "I don't get why people are saying this is an okay lane change.  It's an unsafe lane change.  I do get that a lot of people drive like this, but it's wrong.\n\nThe driver in the right lane should not be trying to change lanes from behind the car in the left lane (the cop car).  The cop car may not see that the car trying to change lanes.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the car changing lanes to make sure the lane change is safe.  They cannot force their way into the left lane.  That is what is illegal.  The car going straight has the right of way.\n\nYou are also supposed to use your mirror when changing lanes.  If you can see a car in the lane you are changing to in your mirror in a way where you are close to overlapping each other you are not supposed to proceed.  If you do not see a car in your rear mirror but do see it in your side mirror it is 100% not safe to change lanes.\n\nIf this were reversed and it was a cop car making the lane change I think people's opinions would be completely opposite.",

Drivers like you are the reason I almost rear-end someone for every 40km / 25 miles of autobahn driven. Maybe don't try to merge in front of me within my safe following distance to the next car ahead when I'm going 50 kph faster than you and the left lane is completely empty for half a kilometre behind me. I'm not even exaggerating\u00a0",

            "Reminds me of the one time driving home after work on a Friday when a lot of people drive recklessly to get home. It was a two lane road and quite busy. This jackass floors it past me and starts coming into my lane between me and the car in front of me. The gap wasn't nearly big enough to accommodate his car so I hooted but he gave zero fucks and kept coming in so I was forced to slow down to avoid him hitting my car. The other lane opens up so I change over before he decides to and I just keep up with him to basically box him in, leaving his speed at the mercy of the car in front of him. He gets annoyed and starts tailgating the car in front of him and flashing his lights, but this car wasn't giving in. Said car had to slow down because another further ahead entered the road into his lane, and I wasn't going to slow down to keep boxing him in (and potentially inconvenience the cars coming up behind me), so I drive ahead and this guy finally overtakes the car he'd been flashing. I look in the rearview mirror and that car gets behind him and then puts his police lights on and pulls this guy over. He basically harassed an undercover cop car\ud83d\ude02",

I see cars change lanes all the time and just leave their signal on for several seconds before they turn it off. \n\nTurning it off (for at least like 3 seconds) and back on is a very easy way to make it very clear what your intentions are.",

            "It's illegal because the white suv never establishes itself in the middle lane. they changed from the far right lane, to the far left lane without stopping. Also, depending on where this is, it is the car that is changing lanes responsibility to avoid collisions, and changing lanes in a manner that brings the lane to a complete stop on the highway is not avoiding collisions.",

Any of you who think that just because you turn on your signal, you should be able to cross multiple lanes of traffic and should have your licenses revoked. That white SUV caused two different vehicles to break because they didn't judge the merging distance correctly. Whether it's to be nice or not is irrelevant. If there is so little space from a person merging that they and the car behind them have to brake, they are wrong and did not merge safely.",

Not to mention the right of way is still the car that is in lane. Far left lane is usually for passing and going fast, this person manages to slow two lanes in doing so. You already saw them cut off the previous car. \n\nPlease don't merge with such little space, it's dangerous and you don't have the right of way.",

Its fine when there is really light traffic, but when its congested, youll get people cutting in none stop.  Its mainly like this in heavy traffic areas\n\nYou have to balance between not giving free space, but not being too close that its dangerous\n\nIf you want to lane change, indicate and wait it out.  You will get space, got to be patient.   Plan ahead.   I know ppl like to say everyone are asshole drivers, but thats not it.  You have to be kinda defensive of your spot.  I mean I guess you can let ppl in, but youll be delayed your trip quite a bit.  I think most asshole drivers get like that by blaming others for bad driving and such.\n\nI find this its like this in big cities.  I havent been to too many tho.  Even in america, go 20 miles away from city and its not going to be so crazy like this\n\nThis guy forced it\n\nYes the cop couldve just let him in, but its the lane changers greater responsibility to do it right.  \n\nJust because someones being an asshole, doesnt mean you should force your way in\n\nIve had this happen where I wouldve crashed into someone if I didnt brake or move out of the way.  They would just slowly creep in.  Its annoying as hell.  Because you are the one that prevented a collision, but nothing comes of it.  You stay and get hit?  While its the other guys fault, dealing with the headache after is not worth it either.\n\nThing is, most drivers that do this are trying to shave seconds off there trip.",

So if lane A is merging into lane B then Lane A is generally expected to drop back a car length and fall in behind the car that was next to him.\n\n3) He simply did not ensure that there was proper room to merge, which is unsafe.

However we are under no obligation to make room, so when cars start changing lanes where my car already is, it definitely pisses me off.

            "In US lane changes are requests.  You fit in where you can, but if you force somebody to brake to avoid an immediate collision then you you're driving aggressively and are liable to be pulled over for an unsafe lane change.  Multiple lane changes, where you cross over two or more lanes without stopping, is generally illegal as well.\n\nWill also point out, left lane is usually for passing, and some states make it illegal to squat in that lane unless you're emergency services.  The fact that lane was going slowest is a bit odd, so probably either an upcoming exit, a convoy, or the cop was getting ready to pull over some else entirely.  Judging by the double lane change, probably an exit which...yeah.  That's a very easy improper lane change ticket.",

When you need decent speed but also options to go left or right, it's perfect to maintain the middle lane.\n\nThe right lane is the slowest because everyone is slowing down to turn or exit from it.

It is not recommended at high speed.\n\nThat's only for congested roads at all other times you should do what the road signs tell you too. Closed Lane != Congested.
