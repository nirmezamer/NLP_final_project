            "What DLC that could help gaining legitimacy? I played vanilla, and never get problems to scale, but this legitimacy hindered me a lot, especially when playing the third character in my run. Even hunting and feasting dont help much.",
            "Does the legendary hunter lodge increase my global chance of legendary hunts, or do I need to hunt in the provnice it's in?",
            "What decides if my war for someone's duchy/kingdom claim will only take that duchy/kingdom or everything the duchy/kingdom owner possesses? I did a war for the Kingdom of Bohemia against the HRE and got everything the vassal king owned, but I want to do the same with the duchy of Angria and I don't get anything apart from the lands of Angria itself. Both wars are for someone else's claim.",
            "I just started playing CK3 this week. I think I'm too stupid for this game. I've watched tutorial videos, and I've played through the in game tutorial. I don't understand how to play this game but I want to. I've tried restarting two campains and I didn't get very far in either where it felt like there was nothing for me to do. All my counsel seats filled. No one to declare war with. Already scheming to win favor of the bishop who apparently hates me. But then I run out of money and it feels like there's nothing for me to do. \n\nI think I need to watch some playthrough videos and see what all the options do and when I'm supposed to choose them. This game got a 10/10 and I really want to experience what it has to offer.",
            "What's a good way to participate in a Great Holy War. I have only recently gotten into the 1066 start, but I've stayed focused on the northern vikings and Spain. What's a good start or ally to get pulled into a Great Holy War for the \"For The Faith!\" achievement?",
            "Any advice for playing in the area of Poland? More specifically I'm wanting to play as Prussia/Vidilist and make Lithuania because it's one of the first places I played in CK3 and just really struggled with because of the constant Norse raiders.",
            "If I hybridize two cultures with unique men at arms do I get to use both of them?",
            "Is there a way to get a family member as head of a mercenary company? Also is there a limit to how many holdings a holy order can have? Both Ck3 and Ck2 answers appreciated as I plan to play both.",
            "Legitimacy is such stupid shit. Let's force a mechanic on everyone but only allow the people that hand us extra money the ability to deal with it. If I don't have legends of the dead what am I genuinely supposed to do?",
            "When you press a claim for a title, you (or your claiment) gets the main title, if they are unlanded they will be given one county within the claim, and they inherit the vassals of the previous owner that are within the de jure borders of the title. I'm guessing what happened with Bohemia is the old king had vassals that owned land both within the kingdom of Bohemia, but also within the HRE in general. When you won the war, by inheriting those vassals, you also got some land outside of Bohemia. For the duchy of Angria, the previous owner either had no vassals, or their vassals had no land outside of the duchy. The larger a title gets, the worse the AI gets at managing which vassals belong to which ruler, and it gets harder to manage yourself, as your vassals with nice borders go off conquering internally and externally on their own.",
            "Yeah that's how I felt in the early days.  It was a very different experience from what I'm used too.  Raiding felt like \"the only\" thing I was actually doing.\n\nOnce it all clicks you'll have less \"nothing to do\" moments.",
            "Watching playthroughs helped me learn in a big way. Just to see how someone goes about their playthrough, choosing a goal to accomplish and how they go about doing it. \n\nThe game is overwhelming. You need a goal and a direction. You need to know the levers to pull to start working towards the goals. \n\nOnce you understand that a little bit more, the game becomes more clear. It's a sandbox and that can be overwhelming. \n\nThe more you learn, the more avenues of play open up.",
            "Great holy wars AFAIK focus mostly on the holy sites for that faith though ,in my experience at least, it prioritises player made religions.\n\n\nThe best war to get the achievement is to be a catholic in 1066 and wait for the pope to call one, if you start as the ruler of Denmark in 1066 ohh can get 2 achievements for that as well",
            "Early on, conquer as much as possible and don't stop until you have all the land in the kingdom of Lithuania, you will need the levies to fight off raiders. Wait a few years to see who becomes the largest ruler in Scandinavia, and then marry one of your kids to their kids, they should be willing to accept if you are a King; this will stop them from raiding you, and be a great defensive ally if any viking declares an invasion against you. Once you have formed the kingdom, go and raid the Norse yourself, if their land is messed up from raids, they won't be able to hit you as much",
            "If the MaA are made available from unlocked innovations, then the answer is always yes. If the MaA are from cultural traditions, then the answer is yes as long as you keep both the traditions. However, if you abandon a tradition that formerly gave you that MaA, and they're already hired, you'll keep them."

            "Can't wait to field 75 different regiments of palatini against the mongol horde",
            "Really tough to evaluate all this without playing it - I can grasp the overall shape but will have to wait and see how it feels when the DLC releases. Am really curious about the scheme overhaul...\n\nIs there any confirmation if Administrative Government is part of the free update or locked behind the DLC?",
            "Oooh baby, the imperial men-at-arms system is looking spicy, not to mention the administrative part!",
            "WOW this dev diary is loaded. Forget landless gameplay, pump this vassal gameplay right into my veins. One thing I appreciate a lot about crusader kings is how well it simulates an entire world, and it's been always a shame that vassals basically almost do nothing expect fabricate claims and join factions. These new features remind me a lot of the noble clans in Feudal Japan who spread their influence everywhere and control the empire from behind the scenes. I feel like now that'll be much more possible in crusader kings so I'm really looking forward to it. Conceptually, I think they really did a great job on this and improved on the merchant family gameplay from ck2. I've been pretty pessimistic about ck3 as a whole recently but if this new update radically transforms the vassal gameplay, it would really make that whole bundle worth buying for.",
            "Not gonna lie, I don't know enough about the organisation of the Byzantine Empire to know if this is an accurate depiction of its machinations or not. But all of the things that I read about administrative government are basically the stuff that I wanted playable republics to be.\n\nSo despite my initial reservations regarding the DLC (sorry but I'm still not interested in playing as the BE) I'm pretty hyped now. Finally I'll be able to turn Germany into the bureaucratic monstrosity it's supposed to be!",
            "Reading this while relaxing in a Spa. Life is good \ud83d\ude0e",
            "The theme system looks like a lot of fun. I think it will be more fun to play as a vassal than an emperor with this set-up. \n\nI wonder if you can set up a feudal realm within an administrative realm. Historically, this sort of (re)patrimonialization was a huge problem for empires that manage to rise past feudalism. Can a governor conquer new territory outside his theme and make it a hereditary fief? Probably not, but it would be cool.\n\nI have to say that I'm surprised by the people who object to the extra game rules. It literally costs you nothing and they start off by default. What are these people complaining about?",
            "I can't believe it... they're cooking.",
            "I\u2019m really excited so far for this dlc",
            "The military system seems great, I think the only thing I'd like adding is if the AI governors could straight up refuse to let you use their troops if they hate you but aren't rebelling and if the troops would not necessarily always join them unless personally loyal if they do rebel (as they don't belong to them)",
            "Again, lots of stuff for vassals to do/watch out, but i feel like what you do as emperor has been again left out a bit. \n\nThe frontier administration seems nice. That way my vassals can increase my empire on their own. \n\ni have a question regarding the governor appointment. Did i understand that right that even as emperor i cant just appoint a dude, only shove him on top of the list by spending influence? So its not possible like in CK2 that i just designate someone as viceroy duchy/kingdom holder?",
            "Scheme rework is lowkey the best part of this whole thing - schemes currently suck ass and reworking them is a huge win that will hopefully be part of the free patch",
            "This is too good! The dlc is sounding to be rich af. Are we getting more information about adventurers or unlanded update? This is what I really want to play.",
            "This is getting me quite excited, I love the politicking and the fact the AI will actually naturally have incentives to engage with it, slandering, reputation and forced resignations are fantastic. The new scheme system look very interesting too.",
            "Will there be a cap on noble families? Is it as status we can grant as Emperor? A sort of \u201cRaise to nobility\u201d option.",
            " Just wanted to say that I really appreciate dev diaries being posted as proper link posts on here (unlike some of the other pdx game subs where they are frequently posted as wonky image and/or text posts that you have to search through for the dev diary link).",
            "I think this looks pretty good! Never been a Byzantine fanboy but this looks super fun! \n\nI'm thinking my first playthrough will be some random from Siberia or the White sea area, who as a landless character makes his way down to the Byzantine empire and see where I go from there!",
            "For clarification, we\u2019ll be able to use this Byzantine government type in any realms that meet the requirements?",
            "I do hope proper naval gameplay is added soonish though, it sucks that we just have to completely imagine everything to do with that in our heads and it also sucks that everyone has the same troop transport capability etc",
            "So, maybe I missed this and someone can correct me here, but what did governors actually... Do? \n\nI can see that they have an event that fires every couple of years, and sometimes it requires travel. They provide passive bonuses based on their skills, and those skills help them naturally filter to the top of appointments. They do what they can to get their family appointed with more governorships, and acquire more land sometimes. They can squabble with other governors over reputations and status\n\nDo they vote on laws? Can a dominant family put up significant roadblocks in front of something that the emperor wants to do? Can they dictate realm policy in some way?\n\nI guess what I was hoping for here was that governors would have some role to play in administrating the realm, rather than just providing mostly passive bonuses to their emperor. Maybe there's more of that to come?",
            "I look forward to it, the administration seems perfect for making the realm very unstable for bad Emperors, but mighty for qualified Emperors.\n\nSome of the bonus such as maritime and frontier is really good for a Roman play trough. Also new troops Yeah! Can\u2019t wait to fight the mongols again.",
            "Oh man I\u2019d love to see that governor system be expanded to feudal holdings as well. We could FINALLY have an accurate levy system for the first time since CK2.",
            "A few questions :\n\n>Currently, the limit for titles will also not increase with Eras or Innovations, meaning that expanding the realm is the primary way to get more of them. Which meshes well with the idea that an Administrative realm is meant to become a large and sprawling empire. Another balancing factor is that Administrative rulers will have less space for personal Men-at-Arms. Both the regular Men-at-Arms Limit and the Men-at-Arms Size are reduced, allowing them to field less personal troops than other government types.\n\n1. If Innovation and Era won't add additional MAA regiment size and amount for the title-bound MAA, then what about the additional MAA amount granted by traditions (Eastern Roman Legacy tradition adds +2 max size for Heavy Infantry and Heavy Cavalry regiments) and dynastic legacy (Pillage lvl 2 dynastic legacy adds +2 Heavy infantry max size)? \n\n2. Also if you take command of your Governor's MAA, who pays for the cost of the troop's raised and replenishment cost? If the government ruler pays the full cost instead of the emperor, then you can probably purposefully bankrupt a certain governor you don't like by purposefully destroying their troop whether in a war or through attrition so they lose a lot of gold constantly rebuilding their army that they have no control over.  \n\n\n>Secondly, we want to encourage the use of family members to a much larger extent for Administrative governments. Once you have secured a governorship for yourself, you\u2019ll have to start making use of your family. Having family members in high places allows for a wider-spreading web of influence. Given that there is a cap on influence investments (which we discuss below), the more family members you have to spend influence supporting your candidates, the more powerful your family may become.\n\n3. Since family is quite central to the government, do Administrative rulers have access to house unity like Clan rulers or something similar to it?",
            "Eunuchs are better at being a governor? Well, my beloved, superfluous sons - snip, snip.",
            "Excited about this. I imagine this will have stuff added to it in the future.",
            "I feel like there is no reason not to play an administrative government as soon as you get an empire, it just feels like so much fun. I will say though, it looks like to me that the vassals will be getting most of the fun content so far, not so much for the emperor unless I missed something",
            "I think Influence will be one of the best additions, honestly, it has always felt odd that prestige was the one all - end all of beckoning folk to your side or hooks for gaining other vassals within factions.\n\nI still wish that influence was more of a semi-permanent resource or not as solid as the other ones.",
            "I'm not a fan of \"influence\" being just another pool of points to spend to do stuff. I feel like the game should make me feel like I have influence, not just tell me. \n\nEverything else seems pretty promising though.",
            "Governor issues sounds like something that should be in Royal Court. Or a Royal Court reskinned. Not that it is bad, I just hope there will be more than twelve of them. I'm tired of seeing a head rolling event.\n\nEDIT: I am not sure about the Imperial Law levels. Having the ability of realms going to war tied to their tax contribution, opinion etc sucks. I really wish Crown/Imperial Laws levels were divided into several like it was done in Conclave for CK2.\n\n***\n\n> State Faith is not tied specifically to Administrative realms. For ease of use in the modding sphere, we\u2019ve tied the functionality of State Faith to a Government Rule in script. Right now, it\u2019s only shown in the UI for Admin realms since that\u2019s the only place we are using it in vanilla at this stage, but modders should feel free to add it to different government types if they so desire. There are basic triggers and effects to accompany it, so it should be fully usable!\n\nI feel like you guys should expand it to the entire map (if you still have time and free work hours before the update gets \"locked\"), rather than leaving it as a \"good framework for modders to work on, but almost completely ignored by vanilla\". This feels like a thing that should be in every realm, as an expansion of the \"liege is not my faith\" opinion penalties (both character and popular one). Maybe make the cost in Prestige for non-administrative realms.\n\nEDIT 2: I hope the rules per realm are not settable per every single empire but rather a rule for all empires. As in I won't have to switch 12 rules to toggle them all off for example.",
            "Wait, will there be more than 1 version of landless gameplay? Or is it tied strictly to the Administrative government? I thought there would be mercenary bands and landless nobles to play.",
            "Looks pretty fun overall.\nHowever it also looks completely OP from a balance standpoint. But we will see I guess.",
            "I like it a lot. The military stuff in particular seems like a good start for the Muslim system of mamluq askars too, in that landless vassals that act as MaA contributors seem like they'd fit. You could probably even bash together something for Mamluq administrations like the ones that popped up in Delhi and Egypt with this and the regency mechanics.",
            "Really disappointed that they seemed to have changed their minds on kingdoms being able to go admin. Last dev diary they said that was a possibility.",
            "No mention of co-emperorship/Caesar?",
            "Honestly this is great, I do hope they nail execution     this time. The only thing I feel is lacking is bureaucracy, I feel it should not be like crown authority and should be more dynamic. Like TFEs imperial competence.",
            "Anybody else has a Error 54113 when trying to enter the site?",
            "I don't see what efficiency adds that stewardship didn't already cover. \n\nStewardship already represents a character's overall administrative acumen and the efficient management of direct holdings.\n\nThe only rationale I can see is letting low-stewardship characters be good at governing, but that doesn't make a ton of sense since they should not be good at managing things.",
            "Love this. Not surprised that the devs crushed hopes of a naval rework for this update, I very slightly got my hopes up when I saw the \"naval\" option. Hopefully it happens one day in the future.",
            "I think it\u2019d be cool if wandering nobles that weren\u2019t tied to the administrative empire could wander into the empire, and if not join, cause problems that the established nobles would need to resolve as a form of contract. For example, we saw that there was a contract in dealing with bandits; It\u2019d be cool if the wanderer noble could sacrifice a few men to pillage an area for a profit until the local nobility comes to deal with it.",
            "I've never been a huge Byzantine player (though I'm curious if 4th Crusade will be included/hidden in the DLC because... it's a pretty significant moment for them), but I love the fact that, yes, other places can build up to Administrative governments. 14th century France was pretty much one itself. Jean de Picquigny was the Viceroy/Governor of the Languedoc appointed by Phillipe the Fair, long after the territory had been consumed by the royal family.\n\nAlso, they said they weren't adding naval installments to ***THIS*** DLC, implying in the future... they're ripe for the making",
            "I really hope that some of these mechanics don't end up being quite as exclusive to the ERE as these dev diaries suggest. The Abbasids, for instance, also appointed and recalled governors - I loved the changes made to clan government in Legacy of Persia and the corresponding free update, but seeing this content now, I wish they'd included some of it there, too.\n\nMaybe they still will, in the future - as the ERE was represented as having feudal government up to this point and is now getting its own government type, so too maybe the Caliphate, having hitherto been (generic) clan, will get an empire-specific twist on the latter type of government.",
            "Do I understand correctly that we're getting a new Pope election system like in CK2?",
            "So this is going to throw a wrench in More Interactive Vassals (which to me is a required mod).\n\nAdministrative empires are designed to have a military advantage over feudals and clans because they can utilize all of their vassals' men at arms.\n\nIf we include the More Interactive Vassals mod, Feudal and Clan rulers will also get access to their vassals' men at arms through them joining the war. While you don't control them directly, they're still involved. This HEAVILY hampers the administrative realm military advantage. I'm curious to see how/if the mod addresses this.",
            "I'm definitely excited for the new army system, I'm wondering if they'll rework the varangian guard mechanics so that you can actually use them as knights, since that definitely looks like a Varangian Guard Maa in the imperial troops section, has the same icon as Varangian veterans and everything. Currently they kinda just sit around at court",
            "I might have missed it either in this DD or the last one, but does every single courtier that has his own house suddenly get the \"noble family\" duchy-level title? Because that might make it difficult for duchy-level or even count-level and baron-level vassals to have unlanded courtiers, knights, etc.",
            "Varangian adventure to Sicily.\u00a0\nHybridize with greek and get vassalized by Bizzies. Add \u201cpracticed pirates\u201d tradition for your culture and force emperor to give you naval administration.\u00a0Raid everyone with your varangian MaA for huge stacks of gold and prestige.\u00a0\nGet enough gold and get elected Emperor. Now you are in the prime position to reconquer enough territory to reform Roman Empire",
            "I like it in general but I'm concerned the switch to administrative is too easy. They say \"late game empire,\" but the only requirements were having >75 counties (you can go from a duchy to 80 counties in a single lifetime if you do it right), a large but not gigantic amount of gold, and getting your vassals on your side.\n\nThe gold cost scales with realm size, which is good, but honestly I think it should be a truly gargantuan amount of gold, as in effect you are buying the inheritance rights of *every single duchy in the realm*. Like, a realm with 80 counties ought to need 10,000 gold to adopt administrative and it only goes up from there. It needs to be something you really focus on to reform from the decentralized feudal structure of most governments in the game to the centralized, bureaucratic structure of an administrative empire. \n\nThere should also be a technology gate. I shouldn't be able to start as Haraldr Fairhair or Haesteinn and go from a single duchy to a sprawling empire and then introduce an advanced centralized before the year 1000, which based on these requirements should be relatively feasible. IMO, put it at High Medieval - that way it's relatively readily accessible from a 1066 start, but something that's a longer term prospect for an 867 start.",
            "If administrative government could be combined with primogeniture for the emperor title, they'd have a start for implementing Tang China.",
            "I don't know if i just missed it, but is administrative government prevented from having feudal vassals at all?\n\nOr they can have it and just get crippling debufs with it?",
            "Will there be a corresponding \u201ccoronation/emperor acclimation\u201d activity associated with this DLC & succession type?!?! Please please please paradox give us some coronation mechanics!,",
            "> For those of you who remember viceroyalties in CK2, you may remember that one of the most significant drawbacks of how they worked was the constant micro of having to hand out the titles again and again.\n\nThis was not a drawback lol it actually made managing the Empire far easier because you had complete control over who your vassals were.",
            "I am absolutely not hype all.\n\nIt will end as always : how do you want do it? The most efficient way > character become even more op.\n\nThere's just no good reason not to do it like this way.\n\n \nAnd don't come with that lousy argument that is \"roleplay\". The game is just not diversified enough and don't have enough events to be different every game.",
            "I hate how static governments are in ck3. They have the perfect framework with The cultural traditions system, that if they just implemented into governments, would be perfect. Each realm could have a type of government, then modified by various local customs, or realm specific practices. Also the themes giving levies to the emperor is dumb given how they worked irl.",
            "That they didn't implement pronoia system in 1178 and 1066 is criminal.Instead we get a weird and ahistorical theme system like in CK2 but with extra steps.CK3 was supposed to better implement Byzantine bureaucracy and failed again.",

I.E Varangian veterans being used for an entire Norse army like there were tens of thousands of them.",

            "They said that, like Struggles, the mechanic itself is free, but the specific historical implementation at game start is locked behind the DLC.",
            "Yeah, the shape looks good.  I think it's the execution that's been lacking, not the design, in many of the recent DLC failures.  I don't have any more faith now, than I did before, that they'll execute the design well.  So I'm gonna (finally) wait for some reviews before I buy this DLC.",

            "Pretty sure that is possible actually, since frontier-appointed governors can expand the realm and those lands will be feudal vassals, however there will be options to force them into the administrative realm, I dont believe they mentioned the requirements for that yet",
            "Definitely, could be based on influence too. \n\nThat should also be a thing for all other government types I think. There should be a call vassals to war option for where they can refuse, difference being other government types' vassals would have more levies compared to admin's men at arms and you wouldnt control them directly.\n\nClan may work based on opinion, plus if you have high house unity you can control vassal troops of your dynasty for example.\n\nTribal call vassal to war based on prestige, theocracy on piety, feudal maybe on legitimacy",

Not a lot of character interaction. \n\nSo from what I see, governors are valuable due to their skills, increasing their tax contribution and the effectiveness of their troops. Their appointments are largely automated where skilled governors filter to the top, but you (and they) can put your fingers on the scales to influence who gets in. \n\nGovernors get their own unique events that they can travel to on order to maintain their provinces, but these are independent and the emperor doesn't interact with this at all. \n\nSo I guess my question is... how does the governor contribute to the management of the realm other than passive incomes for the emperor?

I mean from a gameplay mechanic as well as historically. There is a reason why the romans made two emperors in the first place and the byzantz even existed. (Me, knowing how history went, would want to prevent this by just making kings instead of a co-ruler). \n\nPersonally, i liked installing viceroy kingdoms as the byzantine empire because this also solved the problem of having to micro manage viceroy duchies. Thats now the problem of my viceroy king. After all, i am the emperor and dont have time for petty tasks like assigning duke for duckies.\n\nThe more i think about it and how Paradox seems to handle the Byzantine empire with the themes and with your information, i dont think that expanding the empire is what Paradox intents for us to do. I have a feeling that paradox wants the byzantine empire to stagnate, the player to play as vassal/governors, do some scheming, build your estate and that if he makes it to emperor, its a fun little experience for some years until the next election is and somebody else is elected. When the empire stagnates, the player will then have only access to a couple of themes to manages, which is manageable. If the byzantine becomes to strong, suddenly the player would have hundred of themes to manage and that is not really fun anymore, nor would he really know what to do. \n\nI am not saying the byzantine should expand heavily on its own. When it Ai controlled, having it stagnate and behave like it did historically is ok. However when i steer the byzantine empire, i obviously want it to become a powerhouse and restore the roman empire.",

There are technical limitations we need to keep in mind, and every landless character that is playable must, like we explain for playable noble families, have a designated title that allows them to remain playable. The difference compared to regular rulers is that they simply do not need to hold any land next to their \"landless title\". We'll go deeper into adventurer gameplay in a DD after summer.\u201c\n\nIt could still be possible that you can create a custom character with such a special landless title.

Grantees *absolutely* did not own their grant, with the ability to sell or take by force. \n\nPronoia was a grant of authority to individuals, like any other Roman office.

Then it becomes administrative if the land is at least duchy level and you create that province. (County level administrative vassals can only exist once their duchy level title is created)\n\nNow there could be a title law or decision to make a duchy administrative after granting or it could be that granting duchy or above titles as an admin ruler will always make the granted land admin similar to how clan works with counties.",

Like a character of chinese culture just won't/can't declare conquest wars outside greater china due to their philosophy (being the middle kingdom and all that) unless maybe w very specific traits. However if you were to be of a different culture you could still expand china.\n\nI mean I assume that whole map expansion would make china quite big in terms of the number of counties so its not as if a unified greater china would be anywhere close to a small realm.

            "Ya it is a bit harder to differentiate the two but I see prestige as the pull you have by how famous you are, where as influence is your pull by political connections.

Blood ties was a qualification to get you in the running, but wasn't sufficient to get you title.\n\nThe Latin Empire intentionally demolished the latter system in favor of something resembling the former.",

You were expected to hire and maintain soldiers, maintain roads, build buildings, and executive imperial policy all out of your own pocket.\n\nYou were still a servant of the people and emperor of the Romans. If you failed in your duties, or pocketed too much of the cash, you lost your grant and office. When you died, your grant died with you. The emperor, if he so chose, could appoint a successor to your former office and he may or may not grant a pronoia to him.

I fear higher number of personal maa will still win out.\n\nMaybe thats historically accurate with stuff like the the seljuks invasion, idk. I'm just saying I think they should be careful with balancing this if they want to make administrative actually powerful. It's good if it's more powerful only when you are playing well, with lots of influence and good relations, but the max potential needs to be higher.",
            "The former system developed out of the latter. Counts were originally appointed officials, some of which governed land, who were there to do the bidding of the king. As the power of the king faltered and the state failed to centralize or stay centralized, the counts and dukes made the titles hereditary and did their own thing. That's decentralization. They were basically warlords in a medieval facsimile of Somalia. But the system was not set up that way, except maybe in England and some other places in imitation of what had developed in the ruins of the western Roman Empire.",

            "Except not always, there were clean breaks in the breakdown of the western empire and the Germanic systems supplanted Roman administration and law practically overnight. This eventually formalized into new institutions, some of which adopted Latin names. Medieval counts have little in common with Roman *comites*.\n\nThis isn't true of all of Europe, of course. Some parts of \"feudal\" Europe was never under Roman comtrol. Which is probably why it's not all that useful to label it all \"feudalism\".\n\nTo be clear, I get what you're saying. I'm just pointing out that Rome wasn't the only legal and cultural system in existence and late antiquity into early medieval wasn't just the decay of Roman institutions. Germanic law and culture (for example) were fundamentally distinct and aajor driver."

            "R5: Magnus Haroldson is the son of the 1066 start date's King of England, Harold II.\n\nAfter the defeat at Hastings, in which Harold II was killed, Magnus and his brothers found refuge in Ireland. However, they were unable to regain the throne of England lost by their father. In 1069 Magnus travelled to Denmark to enlist the help of the king there against the Norman conquerors of England. In his travels he also visited the southern coast of the Baltic Sea. The Polish Duke Boleslaw the Bold did not take part in the expedition, but allowed the Polish nobles of Pomerania to do so. The Danish king agreed to help the brothers. A Danish fleet and its allies set sail for England. According to the chronicler Orderic Vitalis (generally reliable), the Danes and English allies included Poles, Frisians, Saxons and Polabians/Veletians.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful expedition, Magnus again found himself in Poland. In 1074, his sister Gytha of Wessex married the Ruthenian prince Vladimir Monomakh. The only source mentioning him at that time is the 'Polish Chronicle' by Gall Anonymus. The Venetian monk mentions Magnus under the year 1093. He mentions him as Count of Wroc\u0142aw, who by virtue of his function was subordinate only to the palatine and the prince.\n\nAnd indeed, in 1093 there was a revolt in Silesia. Magnus, now being the Count of Wroc\u0142aw, subordinated himself to Zbigniew, Duke of Masovia. Around this time, he became associated with the powerful family of the Awdans (themselves of Scandinavian descent, but that's for another thread), who in 1093 supported Zbigniew against Sieciech, his heir presumptive vying for the throne. In 1097, the Awdans switched sides, and allied themselves with his younger brother Boles\u0142aw Krzywousty. There are basically zero sources on the role played by Magnus during this civil war. It is presumed he was trying to stay off-the-radar and not gain the ill will of any side in the conflict.\n\nAfter the conflict, Boles\u0142aw Krzywousty granted Magnus the title of *\u017cupan* of Mazovia (essentially a person who co-ruled the Duchy with him). From then on, he resided in the Czersk castle. His tasks included protecting Mazovia from invasions by the pagan Pomeranians. Magnus also supported Bishop Simon of Plock. He co-financed the construction of a Romanesque temple at Czersk Castle. Magnus died sometime after 1109. (the exact date is not known).\n\nIn 1966, archaeologists discovered a medieval grave near the Romanesque temple at Czersk. They found an iron-covered coffin inside which was the skeleton of a man with a sword and spear. At his feet were two bronze bowls and a wooden bucket, which was a theme also found in Scandinavian customs at the time. The positioning of the body was indicative of a knight (he died wearing a golden ring on his left hand, and complete dentition was preserved in the skull) The age of the buried person was determined to be 55-60 years, height 1.80 m. There is a very high probability that this is the grave of Magnus Haroldson.\n\nThere is in fact also a village named Magnuszew near Czersk, where he died. It is said he is the namesake (and founder) of this village, as it was first mentioned during his reign, and the fact that Y-DNA haplogroup I1 subclades I1-ASP and I1-T2 (both of which are originally found in England and Denmark) have a much higher frequency in families who live in/near the village compared to the rest of Poland.\n\nTwentieth century historians also believed that he was father of one W\u0142ost, who himself was the father of Piotr W\u0142ostowic, voivode of Duke Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth (nephew of Boles\u0142aw II) and progenitor of the \u0141ab\u0119d\u017a clan.",
