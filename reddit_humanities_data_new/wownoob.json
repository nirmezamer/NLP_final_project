It would be nice to have someone to run dungeons and normal raids to get some alts leveled up. \nShared interests would be great, but not required.  I love music of all kinds (not much country though). Some examples: Wu Tang Clan, Pearl Jam, The Midnight. Shows: Arrested Development, Avatar: TLA and Korra, Ahsoka, Andor, Community, Stranger Things.  Outside of video games I like bball, hiking, and trying to be active.  \nUsually evenings work better after kids are in bed.  Thanks!  Good luck everyone.",

I went to the barber and changed my evoker to a female and toggled auto visage. And it just clicked. I found my main. \n\nMeanwhile, I've flirted with dk here and there but never to high level. For remix, I was messing with the character screen and female panda DK just looked awesome one handing a big 2h sword like a ninja. Then I felt powerful with the visuals and I fell in love again.\n\nWhich is weird because I've tanked end game as a monk, druid, and paladin.

And monk and priest have been the most appealing for me for a long time.\n\nOn the rare occasion that I do wanna play dps, survival hunter Is my go to right now. I've dabbled in pretty much all classes, and this season I discovered survival. It just clicked for me. The spec is so damn fun to play. Who would've thought that throwing bombs in people's faces is fun lol. And seeing the changes they made so far in tww to hunter, I'm already hyped to try out survival next expansion.",

But it was because I could turn into the demon. I hate they took that away. I did level one recently. The rotation seems a bit more intuitive than BM hunter.",

Your question may be confusing to me due to a language barrier, but the potential to meet many other players is there.",
            "1. It costs a ton of in-game gold to purchase a WoW token on the auction house (the subscription). As a new player, the time it would take you in game hours would be crazy long. The time you spend trying to do it, you may as well just save money in real life to purchase a monthly subscription.\n\n2. The new expansion (The War Within) is released on 26 August. You can pre-buy it now and it will give you all the previous expansions (including the current Dragonflight expansion). If you are not sure, then you can start for free and level a character from L1-20 to try the game out. Then you can decide then if you want to buy a subscription and then pre-buy War Within, which will give you access to all the expansions right away.\n\n3. There are guilds you can join, and Discord too. At the moment, it is less busy because people are waiting for the next expansion but still players around.",

            ">After how long does it become feasible for someone starting from 0 to be able to purchase game time using only in-game currency?\n\nIf you've never played WoW before, I'd say it's going to take you quite a while to get to a point where you sustain yourself with in-game gold. In order to make money, you have to invest money. And if you don't have any money to invest, you won't make enough either. Simple economics. This works pretty much the same in all MMOs where you can buy game time with in-game currency.\n\nI'd recommend paying for your subscription the old-fashioned way instead. It's less stressful in the long run.\n\n>How does the expansion issue work?\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by 'issue'.\n\n>Is it true that you know many people?\n\nAgain, I don't quite understand your question. If you're asking if it's possible to get to know people, the answer is absolutely. If you're asking if I personally know many people in the game, the answer is no.",
