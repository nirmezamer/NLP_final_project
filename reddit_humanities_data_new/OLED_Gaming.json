            "Based on the Monitors Unboxed review of the MPG 321URX, it seems like you guys did a very good job, so kudos for that and for undercutting the price of competitors by so much. I\u2019d like to add some feedback based on this post, the review, and the general monitor market \u2014 so please pass this along to the engineering/design team if possible:\n\n- Never release a monitor without user updateable firmware\n\n- sRGB mode should be \u201cunlocked\u201d, where the user can manually adjust RGB primaries to achieve better white balance. Looks like the sRGB mode on the MPG 321URX is very good, but this would ensure panel variance and degradation over time will not affect color accuracy in SDR.\n\n- Chinless (4-sided bezel-less) designs would be much preferred. As far as I know, there is no necessity for an OLED panel to have a chin, whereas on most LCD panels it is required due to the backlight. It seems it\u2019s on there only for branding. Chinless monitors ALWAYS look more premium and aesthetically pleasing than ones with a chin, and it allows multi-monitor setups to be done without any gap between monitors.\n\n- Better HDR color calibration. Looks like it\u2019s pretty good on the MPG 321URX based on the Monitors Unboxed review, so at a much lower price than competitors it\u2019s not that big of a deal, but the PG32UCDM is definitely better. Considering that users have no method at all to calibrate HDR on monitors at the moment, it should be very accurate, especially on products as expensive as these.\n\n- Lowest possible input lag at ALL refresh rates. Per the Monitors Unboxed review it\u2019s extremely low at 240hz, but he shows in the \u201cHUB essentials checklist\u201d at the end that it\u2019s >1ms at 60hz, but doesn\u2019t provide a value for it so I can\u2019t comment on if it\u2019s bad or not. Seems like based on TFTCentral\u2019s reviews where he recently started putting in 60hz input lag, that 2-4ms is a good value. Also, something akin to LG\u2019s \u201cboost\u201d input lag mode on their OLED TVs would be an awesome feature on a monitor for lower refresh rates.\n\nOthers please feel free to add on, I hope OP sees this and passes it on to the MSI team. This feedback is mainly meant for future monitors \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if any of these software-related comments can be done with a firmware update.",
            "To be abundantly clear, the **MAG 321UPX** will NOT support software updates?",
            "RIP all that bought the MAG version. No firmware update for you. Better hope out of box is perfect.",
            "What is the reason for the very low MSRP of the MPG 321URX in the US ($950) relative to EU (\u20ac1400)?",
            "That is so weird to segment your product line by being able to update the firmware or not. \n\nIf it was a cost saving measure then MSI has exposed themselves to the risk of not being able to fix bugs that are found later. This hurts the MSI brand.",
            "Is it possible the UPX or URX will have the ability to disable DSC in the future? Disabling DSC with hdmi 2.1 allows 4k 120hz 10bpc while still allowing DSR/DLDSR to be functional with Nvidia cards. This is perfect for single player and older games that have the headroom to utilize DSR for much better picture quality when you don\u2019t need super high refresh rate. The price is right and the monitors look great, but not having the ability to use DLDSR by disabling DSC is a deal breaker for me unfortunately\u2026",
            "The MAG line should be discontinued after this year. For the majority of the time since their announcement, it was difficult to understand the differences between the models. Now that I know the MAG line won't have updatable firmware, I don't see why any knowledgeable consumer would want one.",
            "So just so I understand since I\u2019m new to buying monitors. If I buy the MAG 271QPX I will never get a software updates so any issues it comes with I will just have to deal with?",

Now that you\u2019ve added all the new dimming features to OLED Care 2.0, which options have to be kept enabled to keep the three-year burn-in warranty valid?\n\nCan we please see the specific warranty language that would cover the MPG 321URX?",

            "u/MSI_Darutohne\n\nI think many of us would greatly appreciate it if you please pass the following on to the design/engineering team:\n\nPlease implement **Hot Plug Detect** logic that **does NOT** tell the GPU and/or Windows that the monitor is disconnected when the monitor goes into standby mode, when powered off (via the power button), when switching between SDR/HDR, etc.\n\nOr even better, at least give people the option to toggle the logic if it's a power-saving feature.\n\nThis is one of the most frustrating issues with PC monitors because it causes Windows to act like it's having a seizure, rearrange desktops, and to change multi-monitor configurations.\n\nIt can also lead to BSODs / crashing when a video or game is running.\n\nA positive improvement or feature like this would give your products a big advantage over your competitors.\n\nThanks!",

            "u/MSI_Darutohne\n\nI'm experiencing an issue that just started happening within the last day. I've had the MPG 321URX for almost a week with only two issues (see end of post) so this is unexpected. \n\nEssentially, whether I'm on the desktop working or in a game, the monitor will just power off with no warning and start the pixel refresh process. There is no indication whatsoever that something is amiss. The screen goes black, the monitor powers down, starts pixel refreshing (orange blinking light), then will shut down afterward. This is particularly egregious because it also disables the KVM meaning I have no control over either system connected (seems like KVM should remain powered while it's in this low power state...).\n\nIf I interrupt it, it will say the panel protect was interrupted and that I have two options: execute (start it again) or cancel. This prompt is non-interactable. Not a single button combination selects either execute or cancel. This prompt will go away after maybe three minutes and then at a seemingly random time after this, the panel will again unceremoniously turn itself off and begin the pixel refresh. The *only* way to stop this loop is to let it finish or run panel protect manually. At which point it just starts this loop again later. This loop turning off until pixel refresh has completed has happened four separate times now within 24 hours. This behavior is entirely new and was not seen when I received it. I also updated the monitor to the latest firmware *.009 upon receipt last week. Nothing about my computer setup or software has notably changed in that time either.\n\nI have it set to 16 hr notification, power button set to turn off not standby, panel protect has run at least once per day at night when turning my computers off, and the timer between pixel refreshes has been anywhere between 3hrs to 10hrs indicating that it's seemingly not timer related. As this does not happen on any other display I own, it would indicate to me that it's a monitor issue. I have not yet been able to test if it happens on displayport only or hdmi as well but it seems unlikely for it to matter with how its manifesting.\n\nThis has been... annoying to say the least. What could be causing this and what are possible remedies? Is this something the team is aware of? \n\nIn terms of other low priority issues I am curious about:\n\n1. Has the team indicated its possible to add an option for not powering the monitor off (i.e. return to last power state) post pixel refresh via a firmware update? It's mildly annoying to need to power on the monitor every time I come back to the computer but not a big deal.\n\n2. Is the ability to gain a toggle for the power led to be turned on or off (except for pixel refresh indication) something that can be added to a future firmware update? It would be very nice to be able to disable this singular point light instead of needing to tape over it.",

            "/u/MSI_Darutohne /u/CND_CEM\n\nThere are still a number of issues with the MPG 321URX that need addressing. I've actually had many more (and dramatically more significant) issues with the monitor with the latest firmware than with the one prior.\n\nThe issues in order of least to most severe:\n\n1. The built-in crosshair should have more non-bizarre options. Basic cross, a dot, scalable size, RGB customization should be relatively simple to implement and would make it better for a variety of games. The included cross+dot option, for instance, is comically large. But there isn't a smaller version or just a cross or dot version. And you can't set the color. You have an adaptive (i.e. annoyingly distracting) option and a static white/red option. Why can't you set the RGB value of this crosshair? Red / white are not useful colors in games and blend in heavily (particularly when they're not even outlined like the crosshair in this monitor) in most games. A neon green option, as an example, or an RGB scale would be much preferred. \n\n2. The navi key should be augmented to include a crosshair toggle instead of just being the crosshair menu. Being able to press up and have it just toggle the last crosshair chosen to enable/disable it instead of having to menu a bunch of times would be much more convenient. The option to have the menu is nice but an additional toggle would be even better.\n\n3. Does not respect custom image temperature settings. If I set a custom RGB value it stays so long as it doesn't switch picture modes. If I set custom RGB values for HDR in User mode then switch to any other profile or go back to SDR using sRGB then when I return to HDR, the custom values are completely forgotten and it's back to the default settings. This means it is NOT actually storing any useful profile information and is instead just toggling it to the last profile but none of the actual profile information is saved. This is obnoxious and defeats the purpose of it remembering picture modes between SDR/HDR if you have to still manually adjust the RGB values each time you switch to HDR.\n\n4. If the input source is switched to, say, the USB-C input rather than upstream and there is no second source connected and the upstream source is either suspended or off, you CANNOT switch the USB source input. This means that you CANNOT switch to sending usb inputs to the upstream device without connecting a second source so that the display doesn't automatically attempt to go into standby immediately when it fails to detect a source. This means that I can't wake up my windows desktop if it went to sleep if I don't have an alternative source ready. Given that the monitor has a KVM and I regularly switch between a laptop and desktop, the auto mode is insufficient and having discrete control over what the source usb/video is is paramount. Given this, if I don't remember to reset source inputs before disconnecting a source, it may be completely non-functional until I reconnect a source and then change it back. Ridiculous. \n\n5. Why is the OSD completely inaccessible if there is no source connected to the display? I was debugging a card and needed to change to not using DSC but, guess what, you actually couldn't access the osd without a viable source already connected. Every monitor I've ever used has let me do this without a source connected.\n\n6. The panel DOES NOT actually do standby pixel refreshes anymore. Ever. I have to manually engage the pixel refresh function EVERY DAY. It does not do it when the computer is off, when the computer is asleep, when the computer is idle, or at any other useful time. It does this regardless of whether the power button mode is set to OFF or STANDBY. This is extraordinarily obnoxious and is making me regret the monitor and making me consider never buying any MSI product ever again with how poorly this firmware has been implemented. There is an existing bugreport for this on the forums [here.] (https://forum-en.msi.com/index.php?threads/bug-report-321urx-latest-firmware-fw-010-panel-protect-oled-care-not-working-in-the-standby-mode.397255/)\n\n7. The pixel refresh does not respect the timer. It has initiated a forceful pixel refresh at seemingly random intervals regardless of the timer in the OSD. I've had it start at 1.5 hours, 5, 7.5, 9, 13, and 15 hours. This is absolutely ridiculous. What is the point of a timer if it isn't even respected? \n\n8. The pixel protect IS NOT CANCELLABLE. How is this acceptable? If I'm in the middle of a meeting or the middle of a game, the RANDOM pixel refresh will POP UP and completely obscure the screen. There is no ability to cancel it. There is a nice cancel button that is greyed out and is inaccessible. Give me a warning or don't let users defer it 5+ times in a row or something. But it's absolutely inexcusable to have an UNSKIPPABLE MANDATORY PIXEL REFRESH MAKE THE DISPLAY USELESS. It will 100% black out the screen and make navigating / doing anything useful impossible and, if you forcibly cancel it like it suggests with the power button, it initiates it again IMMEDIATELY upon resuming displaying content. It is IMPOSSIBLE to do literally anything useful with the monitor when it decides to (arbitrarily) take away control from the user. This in conjunction with standby refreshes being unequivocally broken (both on windows and mac I might add) and the timer being utterly pointless, the monitor is distressingly unreliable.\n\nI really hope these can be addressed because the monitor with the latest firmware (FW.010) is downright unreliable and has negatively affected my work/games at critical moments because of an infuriating lack of attention to detail. If these can't be addressed, I will absolutely never be purchasing an MSI product again and steering everyone well clear of them. I cannot believe something as basic as a display has so many usability issues the likes I've never seen before. I've used multiple oled displays in the past couple years, and none of them have had issues like this. At least in the older firmware the standby refresh actually worked and it didn't seem to do pixel refresh at random intervals.",

They'll first attempt to repair it, but if that's not feasible, they must refund the customer.\n\nSo, to sum it up, if there's any software-related flaw with a monitor, in Germany, the manufacturer, like MSI in this case, would be in a bit of a tight spot. They are legally required to address the issue, or else they'll have to issue a refund. So im pretty sure there is a way to adress the Problem as MSI has announced the MAG 321 UPX aswell.

The only thing I can think that might have influenced it was a local power outage which happened the night prior to issues beginning. It was on a surge protector but lost power hours after it had been put into standby and subsequently shut off after pixel cleaning. That's the only thing I can think of with regards to what potentially started the issue. However, there's nothing I can think of that would have stopped it. I haven't updated drivers/anything related on my systems and it had been primarily connected to the same ports and accessories before, during, and after the issuse arose. It's good to hear there aren't other cases like it so I'll just chalk it up to some oddity caused by the power outage and stop thinking about it. \n\nAgain, appreciate your time here!

To see reps here trying to improve stuff and communicate with people a lot and also frequently is very good and you are also pushing MSIs reputation a lot. That is how a company should operate and not ignore stuff and sweep it under the rug like a lot of other companies do.\n\nEspecially a fix for this issue with white horizontal lines appearing in 360Hz mode in some cases on the 271QRX and the factory mode color cycling that gets triggered sometimes. Because without these issues and with a DSC on/off toggle added in the future and custom resolution support in nvidia control panel together with 1:1 mode it is literally a flawless monitor.

Again, this only seems to happen when set to 360Hz.\n\nI want to stress this ISN'T the only situation where it happens, it's just where it's easiest to see, white on black. It happens in videogames and media too, etc, it's just harder to see in those since it's not white on black (lower contrast, fainter lines), and it can happen anywhere on the screen, sometimes the lines are wider or shorter horizontally, etc.\n\nI hope this helps\n\nAlso, sometimes the issue is better or worse upon restarting the monitor or Nvidia driver. So if you're not seeing it, try letting Windows put the display to sleep after 1 minute of inactivity, and wake it up again. Or just use the power button on the monitor to turn it off and on again, and see if the issue is then present.\n\nI can make a video of myself replicating the issue if it helps",

We will be updating this post in the meantime and provide you with additional information after the embargo lifts on May 30th.***\n\n**World's First Glossy Gaming Display**\n\nThe ROG Strix OLED XG27AQDMG is the world\u2019s first gaming monitor to feature a glossy WOLED display. Combined with the latest third generation ROG OLED technologies, the XG27AQDMG showcases vibrant colors, sharper images, and the darkest black hues under any lighting conditions; it also provides up to 20% brighter visuals compared to previous generation ROG monitors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9uwo6wkwon1d1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=616783d6e1a090cd1408360bf7395f985e0b427d\n\nAs an OLED gaming display, the ROG Strix XG27AQDM features a 240Hz refresh rate, sub-1ms response time (0.03ms GTG), BFI support through Extreme Low Motion Blur (ELMB), Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) Support, and NVIDIA G-Sync Compatibility and FreeSync Premium support to ensure that your gameplay is fast and smooth.\n\nFactory calibrated, the display covers 99% DCI-P3 and 135% sRGB, color accurate within Delta E < 2, true 10-bit color, HDR10, is certified for DisplayHDR TrueBlack 400 and maintains a brightness of 275 nits (100% APL) in SDR. The calibration report can be accessed through the OSD as an e-report. As a third-gen WOLED, the display also features the Clear Pixel Edge algorithm to provide crystal-clear text.\n\n**ASPECT RATIO**\n\nFor gamers who typically use smaller monitors, the XG27AQDMG is able to display a 4:3 aspect ratio image, or a full-screen 4:3 aspect with deep black OLED borders around the image. For FPS players, playing on a full-screen 4:3 aspect ratio makes in-game targets or character models look slightly larger, making them easier to hit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1mjfvwmkcs2d1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb5912caeb6902a67c66776a9012360b2771e3c9\n\n**ROG OLED Anti-Flicker Technology**\n\nOne concern OLED gaming displays generate is flicker that occurs when VRR is enabled, due to the way OLED pixels are electrically controlled. This flicker is further amplified by significant refresh-rate fluctuations and the human eye\u2019s sensitivity to changes in brightness, especially in darker scenes. To combat this, new ROG Anti-Flicker technology offers three anti-flicker levels (Strong / Middle / Off) that stabilizes the refresh rate within a carefully optimized range. This minimizes flicker perception to ensure smoother, more enjoyable viewing experiences.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ku3nwqxon1d1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b8b04ccf984bb3b960dad86d2470d293dcbb591\n\n**Cooling Design and ASUS OLED Care**\n\nAs seen with recent ROG OLED Gaming monitors, the ROG Strix XG27AQDMG is designed with features to extend the life of the OLED display and reduce the potential risk for burn-in. The XG27AQDMG includes a custom passive heatsink, a power adapter removed from the display to reduce overall temperature, ASUS OLED Care features, and a microfiber cleaning cloth. ASUS OLED Care includes pixel cleaning, screen saver, screen move, and logo brightness adjustment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v387ike5pn1d1.jpg?width=1276&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=985863717845888941ddbceae26e4fb418ce19b4\n\n**ROG XG S Series**\n\nThe XG27AQDMG is part of our latest ROG Strix XG S Series displays, which have a consistent design theme in mind \u2013 utility, small footprint, ergonomics and connectivity. Starting with the design, the monitor features a small footprint with a compact stand base, preserving valuable desk space and conveniently providing a space to place your cell phone or mobile device while gaming. It also features a full range of ergonomic motion with tilt, swivel, pivot, height adjustment, VESA mount support, and a 1/4\" tripod socket on top of the stand. Lastly, the display provides DisplayPort 1.4 (DSC), 2x HDMI (v2.0), and a USB hub (2x USB 3.2 Gen1 Type-A).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x4ya6n8hpn1d1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99105488839bfc48fee29ace212e54c10078a373\n\n**Specs and Features:**\n\n* 27\u201d (26.5\u201d viewable) QHD (2560x1440) Glossy WOLED with 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms (GTG) response time\n* Equipped with the latest third-generation WOLED technology - including META and Clear Pixel Edge - to provide brighter full-white windows, clearer text, and improved motion clarity\n* Factory calibrated, 275 nits (100% APL) in SDR, 135% sRGB, 99% DCP-P3, true 10-bit, HDR10, DisplayHDR 400 True Black certified\n* Variable Refresh Rate, G-Sync Compatibility, and FreeSync Premium support for supersmooth, tear free visuals with low-latency\n* ASUS-exclusive Extreme Low Motion Blur (ELMB) technology enables even crisper and clearer motion in fast-paced games\n* ROG-exclusive OLED Anti-flicker technology helps reduce the flicker during refresh-rate fluctuations\n* Highly-efficient custom passive heatsink, advanced airflow design, ASUS OLED Care features to reduce temperatures and risk of burn-in\n* Extensive connectivity options include 1x DisplayPort 1.4 (DSC), 2x HDMI 2.0, earphone jack and 2x USB 3.2 Gen1 Type-A\n* Stand includes 1/4\" threaded mount to mount a camera, mic, light, or anything else your battlestation needs\n* ROG Gaming AI technology with Dynamic shadow boost, Dynamic cross-hair, and Display Alignment (helps quickly align this display to another monitor) to enhance users' experience in gaming\n* ASUS DisplayWidget Center allows you to quickly and easily adjust OLED care functions and monitor settings in your OS with a mouse\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ogy8yo7f1t2d1.jpg?width=952&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d1693cea5e7a7757d1fa697e64280d1c1b64b54\n\n* ASUS AuraSync support\n* Supports Firmware Updating\n* 3 Year Warranty (including panel burn-in)\n\n**US Pricing and Availability:**\n\n* US Availability \u2013 May 30th, 2024\n* Price (USD) - $749 (MSRP), with launch exclusive pricing at $699 at Newegg, Microcenter, and the ASUS eShop (limited offer)\n* Product Page - [https://rog.asus.com/us/monitors/27-to-31-5-inches/rog-strix-oled-xg27aqdmg/](https://rog.asus.com/us/monitors/27-to-31-5-inches/rog-strix-oled-xg27aqdmg/)\n\n**FAQ**\n\n*Q. Is the WOLED panel the same as the ROG Swift PG27AQDM?*\n\nA. Yes, it uses the same WOLED panel, but has a native glossy implementation.\n\n*Q. Which version of MLA does it use?*\n\nA. The ROG Strix XG27AQDMG uses third-gen MLA -\n\n* PG27AQDM - 2nd Gen MLA\n* XG27AQDMG - 3rd Gen MLA\n\nQ. *Is the glossy WOLED panel on the ROG Strix XG27AQDMG similar to the Dough Spectrum OLED?*\n\nA. Although they both use the same panel as the PG27AQDM, there are some important differences:\n\n* ROG Strix XG27AQDMG - uses an exclusive native glossy WOLED panel based on the PG27AQDM directly from LG Display.\n* Dough Spectrum - uses the matte version of the WOLED panel based on the PG27AQDM, and then uses a third-party glass cover to provide a glossy appearance. Use of the glass cover can prevent heat from dissipating normally, leading to higher temperatures in the display.\n\n*Q. Does the XG27AQDMG offer the same DCI-P3 and sRGB coverage as the PG27AQDM?*\n\nA. Yes, the color gamut coverage is the same as the PG27AQDM.\n\n*Q. Does this monitor support black frame insertion (BFI)?*\n\nA. Yes, the model supports BFI in the form of Extreme Low Motion Blur (ELMB). BFI is limited to 120Hz and ideally suited for gamers who cannot sustain an ultra-high FPS/refresh rate value ( i.e. 240Hz ) or using a console. In these situations, with ELMB active the effective motion clarity is close to that of 240Hz native operation.\n\n***Usage insight tip***\u00a0\u2013 When utilizing this mode you will see a reduction in panel luminance. This is inherent to the design of ELMB/BFI.\n\nQ. Does HDMI 2.0 affect console functionality?\n\nA. No, HDMI 2.0 does not affect console functionality, and in fact supports Auto-Low Latency Mode (ALLM) and Variable Refresh Rate (VRR).\n\n**MISC.**\n\nAs noted above, we will be adding to this page, so if you have some questions or wonder about specific measurements or features that appear to be missing, it's likely that we simply can't post them yet. However, feel free to ask about them below.\n\nEdit - 5/20 to add more content, FAQ, and update pricing information.\n\nEdit - 5/26 to add additional clarity and context to a number of features, specs, and FAQ\n\nEdit - 5/31 to update product page link.",

The fast IPS will not have the same picture quality as the OLED display, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good display or inaccurate. The PG27AQN is at its heart an esports monitor.\n\nThe XG27AQDMG is a fast display at 240Hz refresh rate, very low response time at sub-1ms, and does a marvelous job at gaming, video, content, and everything else. The picture quality is also excellent. It just doesn't quite rise to the speed and low latency that you need for an esports display. The ROG Swift PG27AQDP later this year will be a lot closer to that with a 480Hz refresh rate.\n\nSo for you, it really boils down to whether you want a top-tier esports monitor or a great looking OLED that covers everything just short of esports display-level speed and latency.",

            "Under certain conditions, yes; in other conditions, no. Although you can find plenty discussion in this sub about people's preferences, the TL:DR version is that a matte screen will be more beneficial in well-lit environments, especially those where you have a lot of natural light that reaches the monitor because you will get reflections on the glossy panel. If your viewing area has little to no lighting, or the lighting is well-controlled, then you can minimize the reflection and potentially see better picture quality with a glossy display.",
            "It's a QHD, so there's a bit less of a concern for performance there. You can take a look at game reviews to see how 3080s stand up to settings at 1440p, and you can always tweak your settings for a higher refresh rate by lowering some of the more demanding settings and utilizing DLSS. The main concern for FPS is going to be the potential for VRR flicker if your FPS is too low, so I would worry more about that than trying to sustain 240Hz.\n\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that because it's an OLED, the response time is incredibly fast, so this will help with tearing and other issues you might see on slower panels. With the exception of a handful of FPS games, like Counter Strike, maxing out your FPS is less of a concern here, and even 80-90 FPS can feel perfectly smooth in many games.",

OLED is so much better image quality but burn in anxiety lead me to use two displays.  I get a choice of a non-OLED with worse image quality or the OLED which gives me burn in anxiety with static element content.",

            "I agree. My 4K ips panel doesn\u2019t look like this. Of course there\u2019s backlight and you can see it and all that - but not this bad. \n\nOf course my oled is million times better - but still, videos and photos make the ips worst than it actually is",

            "The difference is more obvious side to side, in a dark environment, with a camera. But I've had a number of pretty nice VA monitors and even those had a painful black level after I got my first OLED TV. I haven't been able to comfortably play on my PC for YEARS, until a month back that I got a great deal on a 42\" C2 and put it on my desktop. I've played more on my PC in the last month than since I got my BX way back in January 2021.",
            "Question.. is a 1440p OLED monitor better than a 4k IPS monitor?? Apparently, 1440p OLED monitors are quite expensive than the 4k IPS ones.. I haven't had any.. just planning to get a 4k IPS monitor for my PS5..",
            "Really bro ? I haven't got a chance to use WOLED panel, seems like glossy coating is superior to matte, it makes contrasts better and color popping more. That's what Apple always been doing with their monitor since day 1.",
            "i just bought a c1 a couple days ago!",
            "You can't compare different resolution with different panel. 4k is still 4k whether it's ips or oled or anything. Ps5 tends to have stable frameframe so going for oled 1440p is no brainer since it doesn't give you flicker or eye strain, or at least minimal. Also modern 1440p monitor can output 4k signal from ps5 and downscale to 1440p and it looks crisp than native 1440p. So, go for 1440p oled, you won't regret it.",
            "Ohhhh.. I forgot about that upscaling from a normal 1440p monitor.. alright thank you sir!!"

I\u2019ve had my main monitor for 5 years and it\u2019s the same as day 1, and the second monitor for 10 years(that used to be my main) and works just as fine. They\u2019re 240Hz and 144Hz respectively, IPS and amazing colors. Only way I would buy OLED monitor is if they fix the burn in issue significantly or I\u2019ll end up buying mini-led",
