            "LETS FIX TF2!",
            "For those who can't get into the site there's a PDF of it: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1goBP5DVr0we85Ohnc7IHukOtTS-uISEa/view",
            "I'm really impressed with the design and look of the save.tf site. It's clear a lot of care went into the presentation, and it could serve as a good brochure for people unfamiliar with the situation.\n\nWith that said, the writing could use some improvements. Beyond the grammatical errors, there are some key missteps in the approach.\n\nLet's take one example from near the bottom of the page:\n\n> TF2 doesn\u2019t need new content updates, it doesn\u2019t need new microtransactions, it doesn\u2019t need new weapon additions. What TF2 needs is a solution to the bot crisis.\n\nFirst of all, this starts with a run-on sentence. More importantly though, it is simply not a good ask. If I walk into a pawn shop with an expensive piece of jewelry, I don't start off by telling the pawnbroker \"hey I know this watch is valuable, but it's not $10,000 or anything. I'm just looking to make a few grand.\" If you do that, you're already conceding that it's worth less, and choosing to negotiate from an inferior position. Who knows how much it's worth?\n\nSetting an upper limit like this automatically puts a ceiling on the goal. I know it's tempting to say \"Well, Valve didn't care when we did #SaveTF2, so they would just be even more apathetic or annoyed if we raised our demands. If we instead just lower our standards and ask for crumbs, then surely they will have a more open ear!\" Remember though, it's important to not cede ground trying to make it easier on Valve. They have billions of dollars. They can do a lot more than making TF2 simply 'not broken.'\n\nI would rephrase this to read something like:\n\n> Before considering new content updates, all developer attention should be focused on solving the ongoing bot crisis so that TF2 is in a playable state. From there, consistent communication from Valve to address other crucial issues with TF2 would be a necessary next step towards not only a functioning game, but one which is welcoming to new players.\n\nPerhaps in there would be a hyperlink to a list of similar articles describing other issues TF2 has (these are just off the top of my head):\n\n* the competitive matchmaking system is completely dead\n\n* casual matchmaking does not make an effort to put players in servers with similar skill, and most matches end up with 2 or 3 players stomping a server of noobs\n\n* F2P's still cannot use voice commands\n\n* the vast majority of the player count shown on Steam consists of bots (as we all know now per zesty's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2stmQfv93oQ)\n\n* the Replay feature is busted (so I've heard)\n\n* the Training feature has remained unfinished since its conception\n\nHere's another seemingly small but important flaw:\n\n> On June 3rd, we\u2019re all going to collectively group together [...]\n\nWhy *on* June 3rd? This is once again a concession. Say \"Starting on June 3rd\" so there's a contingency for low turnout on that day \u2014 maybe it really heats up on June 4th, who knows. Don't lock yourself in on one day regardless \u2014 it's not like we go silent a day later.\n\nIt would be nice as well if the site had some embedded videos in each section. Perhaps a very brief demonstration of what it's like for a player who just installed TF2 for the first time and decides to join a casual match, only to met with the titular problem.\n\nIt's exciting to see the community spearhead an effort like this with a go-to website that can be easily linked to anywhere. It's important that the execution is as flawless as possible, and I'd be happy to offer more editing suggestions.",

Many games suffer from bot problems but they are just more hidden. Every single game you ever played that has a competitive mode has bots boosting players to higher ranks. \n\nSo what is the goal here? Attention from Valve isn't gonna change any of the above. Valve is not stupid, they know the bots exist and how annoying they are, if they could snap them out of existence they would.\n\nThe only long term solution is literally hiring a bunch of people to constantly look for cheaters and manually ban them, which is unreasonable.",

What TF2 needs is a solution to the bot crisis.\"  \nThe bot crisis is one part but once valve fixes the bot crisis there will be another abandonment crisis for the game, I still find absurd the ammount of recognition and monetary gain this game has made for valve earlier years and still to this day and they cant be bothered to do more than just release horrible lootboxes that dont fit the game, no content updates and like left us in a cliffhanger with the comics.  \nI mean dont get me wrong, am all for even the slightest love from valve to tf2, but we are aiming a bit short I feel, we shouldnt just show the bot crisis, but how abandoned the game is in general from valve, weapons that have been broken for years, broken maps and features, there is just so much unused potential and I feel it would be also worth pointing out in the [save.tf](http://save.tf) site.",

        "content": "If you don't want to read through the whole post, just know this:\n\n#If it's too good to be true, it is.\n\nRandom people who add you out of the blue and immediately ask you for something is a red flag. They try to cast a wide net and add as many people as they can. You might be thinking, it's already bad enough we have to deal with aimbots in our games, but now we need to fight off scammers outside the game too? Sadly, yes. And if you're the type of person who has never seen these scam attempts before, maybe you should keep reading.\n\nThankfully, these scammers are not very creative. The vast majority of them have been using the same scams for years. And yet people still fall for them. Don't be the latest sob story on r/tf2. Here are the most common scams going around today:\n\n#1) Highlander/Tournament Scam [\\(see here for an example\\)](https://i.redd.it/74rxrwlmemk71.jpg)\n\nSomeone will randomly add you and ask you \"which class you prefer to play in Team Fortress 2\". No matter what you respond with, they will follow up that their team is missing a player for their tournament with a kickass prize pool. A variation of this is they will ask you to vote for their team. They might even try to stay topical by saying one of their teammates got covid and can't play. Either way, you will be led to a (fake) tournament site to either sign up or vote for this team.\n\n**How does the scam work?** The site they redirect you to is a fake tournament site, [which might look something like this](https://i.imgur.com/vzxqG3J.png). It exists only to steal your Steam login details. Once you find their team and try to join/vote, you will be redirected to a Steam login page. If you enter in your Steam name and password, your account will get stolen and your items taken.\n\n**How do you know this is a scam?** There are only a few legitimate comp leagues in TF2: UGC, RGL, ETF2L, ozFortress, and AsiaFortress. But even if you're unfamiliar with comp TF2, you should know there's something fishy about someone offering to share such a large prize pool with you with minimal participation. If we look even closer at the site, you'll notice a few things. Many of the \"players\" have profiles related to CS:GO and other real esports athletes, but none that are specific to TF2. You might even notice that many players share the exact same profile pictures. Too bad you can't click on any of their names to check their Steam pages because the site creator didn't think you'd notice.\n\nAnd if that didn't tip you off, take a look at the TF2 tournaments that are supposedly going on. Some players are registered on multiple teams at the same time. [The tournaments page says they are all free to enter, but there is also a monetary prize pool.](https://i.imgur.com/sRvdLkv.png) Where is this money coming from then? Perhaps from a certain bodily part where the sun don't shine.\n\n#2) Steam Admin/False Report Scam [\\(see here for an example\\)](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/scams/2021/03/steam-users-dont-fall-for-the-i-accidentally-reported-you-scam/)\n\nSomeone will randomly add you because they've accidentally reported your Steam account to Steam Support. It was all a mistake, they say, and you should add this \"steam admin\" to sort it out. Once you talk to this (fake) Steam admin, he will either get you to log out of your account and tell him your email address and the verification code sent to your email, or ask for your Steam  username and password. There is even a trading related variation of this scam where your account was reported for \"duped items\", and the fake Steam admin will ask you to send items to a phony trading bot to \"verify\" the items.\n\n**How does the scam work?** This one is pretty simple: once you send your Steam account details or your items to this scammer, they'll be lost. They'll be free to withdraw any items of value from your account and drain it dry.\n\n**How do you know this is a scam?** There is no such thing as a \"steam admin\". [Steam Support also clearly states that \"Steam Support representatives will never ask you for your password\".](https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithAccountStolen#:~:text=Steam%20Support%20representatives%20will%20never%20ask%20you%20for%20your%20password.) \n\n#3) Gambling Site Promotion Scam [\\(see here for an example\\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNdHdxOVXXo)\n\nBy now you probably know how this starts. Someone out of the blue will add you on Steam and start asking you something. In this case he will ask you to help him promote his site through Steam, and in return you will be paid. He will then explain how the payment works. He'll link a gambling site and say he can control who wins the jackpot.\n\n**How does the scam work?** He will pick out a random player on the site, or ask you to pick one out, and he'll make him win the jackpot. Seeing as how he introduced himself as the owner, it's likely that he does indeed have the ability to manipulate the results. However none of the players or roulettes are real. They are all made up and don't link to actual profiles. The scammer will then ask you to bet items of your own and guarantee a win for you. You do as he says and it seems like he made you a winner as well, but of course, you can't seem to get your items back. He might even be cheeky and ask you to do it again. But he has your items and likely will not give them back, even if you ask nicely.\n\n**How do you know this is a scam?** There are no legitimate gambling sites on TF2 today. [They were taken down years ago after Valve was involved in lawsuits about involvement with illegal gambling.](https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/14/12186584/valve-gambling-statement-counter-strike) Anyone trying to peddle a gambling site today is relying on the chance that you don't know this. You might also notice that the gambling sites don't have real players who link to real profile pages, or that the conversations in the chat feed make no sense.\n\n#4) Mannco.store Bot Scam [\\(see here for an example\\)](https://preview.redd.it/237wdqgy2k0a1.png?width=1848&format=png&auto=webp&s=57929f2df8b74d3160dde2f2d026529ec3ed5034)\n\nMannco.store is a legitimate trading site, but it also attracts a lot of scammers who pose as admins or reroute you to fake bot accounts. A trader will add you, usually offering you an incredibly generous deal for your items, but wants to be extra sure that your items are real and you're not scamming them. How ironic. Their reasons will be one of the following: to check the value of your items, to have your items go through a verification process, or to check that your items are \"100% marketable\". Another version of this scam is a phony trade offer posing as a \"deposit request\" from people who might even threaten to delete your items if you don't cooperate.\n \n**How does the scam work?** You will be asked to verify your items through mannco.store. They'll guide you through the steps of adding a mannco.store bot, then you'll receive a new trade offer from an account that appears to be a real bot. [The trade offer will ask for your expensive items with nothing to give you in return.](https://i.imgur.com/HqIPp31.png) They are supposedly going to give your items right back after they \"verify\" them, but they won't. This bot account is a fake. Accept their trade and your items go bye-bye.\n\n**How do you know this is a scam?** Mannco.store explicitly tells you that [their staff will never contact you outside of their own internal messaging system](https://i.imgur.com/4CQk4vc.png). Any invites on Steam or discord from \"admins\" will be scammers. If you're looking to deposit items into your mannco.store account, only accept the trade link generated through their site. And once you do trade with a mannco.store bot, make sure that it's one of the bots from [this list on their website](https://mannco.store/bots), and also that the account is part of the [\"Mannco.store | Bots\" steam group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/MANNCOBOT). You might recognize a fake bot account because [he'll join the \"Mannco.trade\" Steam group](https://i.imgur.com/XN0cLHi.png) but not the official bot group.\n\n#5) Particle Mayhem Scam (\"Vote for my artwork\" Scam) [\\(see here for an example\\)](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fpd7cle86n7lc1.png%3Fwidth%3D1703%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Df6f0919e2b2d35b8106b9fcc8660490dbf3c7064)\n\nThis scam is pretty similar to scam #1, but it's becoming common enough that maybe people need to be warned about this one in particular. Be wary of ANYBODY who asks you to do them a favor in exchange for payment.\n\n**How does the scam work?** It works the same way as the highlander vote scam. You'll be asked to vote for a custom particle effect in exchange for keys as payment. Now how does he want you to vote for his submission? Why through a fake steam login site, of course. Again this is just the highlander vote scam with a fresh coat of paint. These scammers are already reusing old scam methods.\n\n**How do you know this is a scam?** [\"Particle Mayhem 2\"](https://particle-mayhem-2.tf2maps.net/) is a real community contest created by the TF2Maps.net mapping community. However the official site warns that no one will be asked to log in to vote for any submissions. They even point out that the \"Malibu Sunset\" effect is not one of their official entries. It seems these scammers couldn't be bothered to link an actual submission and instead keep sending out the same fake one every time. The contest is also over and the winners announced, so anyone still trying to get votes for their submissions are either obvious scammers or time travelers. \n\n#\"What do I do if I accidentally logged into a scammer's website?\"\n\nAssuming it's not too late and your account/items haven't been stolen yet, go through the following steps:\n\n1) Change your Steam password\n\n2) Go to http://store.steampowered.com/twofactor/manage and deauthorize all devices from logging in to your Steam account.\n\n3) Go to your [Steam API Key page](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) and click \u201cRevoke My Steam Web API key\u201d. This will turn your old API key obsolete and generate a new one. This way you make sure no one retrieves data through your Steam account\u2019s API.\n\n4) Reset your [Steam Trade URL.](https://steamcommunity.com/my/tradeoffers/privacy#trade_offer_access_url) This will disallow scammers from sending you trade offers once you made sure they cannot access your account. Make sure to add your new Trade URL to accounts on websites that you trust so you can otherwise keep on trading as per usual.\n\nBut if all else fails, you might still have a chance of recovering your Steam account by contacting Steam Support.\n\n\u00ad \n\nThose are the most common ones I see going around, but there are likely many more. To reiterate, don't trust any opportunity that seems too good to be true. Don't click on suspicious links from strangers. And immediately be very suspicious of random people adding you on Steam asking you for something. If you notice any of the telltale signs above, block the scammer and report their account on Steam. Steam two-factor authentication doesn't make your account bulletproof, especially if you are fooled into giving your Steam info away to strangers.",

            "I want to cover a rare scam I encountered for the sake of everyone- and it got me, too.\n\nSometime ago some user was contacting me about crypto-related over Steam. I naturally told him to shove off and blocked him, I figured he might\u2019ve been a friend or something that got hacked, I didn\u2019t remember friending him.\n\nThen, from an account that definitely WASN\u2019T my friend, I was contacted by \u2018Victoria\u2019, a Steam admin. They said they were investigating this guy and believed I could\u2019ve perhaps done some trades or something with him of a crummy nature. If only I\u2019d know Steam never contacts you via messages, only email.\n\nWhoever it was played it up to be really convincing- almost scarily so. By some maneuver not only were they talking to me despite me never friending them, but had managed to change my Steam profile picture and display name to reflect that my account was \u2018under review\u2019 (missing pfp and random numbers and letters for the name). Fearing this was an actual investigation, and considering the fact that I HAD been contacted by that guy, I complied.\n\nThey told me to trade my items not to THEM, but to another account or a friend\u2019s. I thought that sounded safe, so I sent it through- though them giving me a 10 minute timer should\u2019ve tipped me off. Or the fact that when I told them I was struggling to put all items into the trade box, they gave me an \u2018extension\u2019. But the fear paralyzed me.\n\nOnce I\u2019d done the trade, I\u2019d been duped. They stopped talking to me, and upon reviewing the trade I realized the worst- they had somehow made a DUPLICATE of the account I\u2019d sent my items to (a friend\u2019s) and redirected the trade to THEM, instead. It looked like my friend\u2019s account but none of the added details were there. I couldn\u2019t fathom how they\u2019d done it unless my account was actually hacked, so I changed my password twice and saved the profile link for the \u2018Steam admin\u2019 and reported them\u2026 but the damage was already done.\n\nOver a thousand dollars of spent Steam funds, rare items like Halloween spelled-weapons, a Halloween spell cosmetic I traded for of limited existence, and even my prized unboxed unusual, a Green energy fat man\u2019s field cap- gone, all gone.\n\nBe wise, peeps.

The scammer is trying to dodge the 7-day hold specifically so they can commit payment fraud, by revoking payment through paypal or whatever after they have your item.  If you say no initially, they will offer \"to go first\" which doesn't matter at all; if they pay you through paypal first then you trade them your item, they will still be able to revoke the paypal payment.\n\nI know this is an iteration on one of the oldest scams out there and is even addressed directly by steam with their \"is this a gift?\" trade warning, but I've seen it tranding a lot lately so figure it would be good to put out there in case anyone doesn't know that paypal fraud and card fraud are super easy to commit.",

Well the cs2 community has known that an update is coming, but they got upset because it didn't come on the 25th anniversary. Meanwhile tf2 players would be literally jumping for joy if we got some of the news and updates that cs2 players got.\n\n(for context on what cs2 will be getting: it was found in the files a while ago that a comic is going to be added, a cs weapon case is in the works for the next major update, along side that 4 maps pretty much confirmed in the update with assets suggesting another map as well, key chains to be added to the game for more customization options for guns. that is on top of weekly or bi weekly updates to try and fix bugs and other complained about areas with the most recent patch fixing some of the networking issues people with high ping had. and last month an estimated 24,414 VAC bans were given. 2 months ago was also the biggest vac ban wave since 2019.

In fact I feel like the bot crisis is being exaggerated by the spearheads of the #FixTF2 movement, where cherry-picked examples of bots making the game unplayable are used and spread around to gain attention, whether it be for clout or ulterior motives. Valve should maintain their anti-cheat so that we don\u2019t have to deal with bots and cheaters, but the issues in casual are nowhere close to being as bad as how people have presented them.",

We cannot interfere in the matters of other communities).\n\n\nAbout the creators...yeah, probably that. I'm of the idea that the movement was genuine at the start, but then they noticed it didn't work and just left without a word. But that's just my opinion.\n\n\nP.S: I don't see why both of our other comments are getting downvoted. At the start, this movement at least united the community against a greater foe and, as I said previously, felt genuine.\n\n\nNow it has devolved into bot porn...I don't think I need to say anything else on the matter.",

It's why #FixTF2 people said over and over again to rub Valve's nose in the fact that they let their game get this way, because the amount of money they're making from us is negligible and the PR hit is the only way this works. The REAL problem is that CS2 ALSO has a rampant cheating problem, and if they're going to spend months-years working on a solution to a cheating problem, it's going to be for that game.",
            "> they'd hopefully atleast do something\n\nWe're thinking they'll suddenly put effort and resources into tackling the bot problem as a whole.\n\nThe easiest actual fix for this is disabling ALL text chat in Casual. Sure it has a catastrophic effect on the gameplay experience for real players, but it 100% solves the issue, gets the problem out of the headlines (if ever it's reported that far) and requires minimal effort. Seems pretty attractive...\n\nIf I went back to pre-bot crisis and said Valve would remove text chat from F2Ps I'd be labelled insane. Heck I'd do the same for anyone making that claim. There is *absolutely no circumstance* they would do that, yet here we are.\n\nI can see the end state of TF2 being totally locked down like that. On Casual anyway.",
            "Yeah and that something is shutting the game down. TF2 isn't valuable enough to risk their image and PR on something as serious as CP. They'll shut the game servers down, keep the item servers up so the economy doesn't go belly-up.

They had a stupid idea and wanted to put it out there, and then people jumped on the FixTF2 train faster than expected, which didn't give the TF2bers enough time to fully plan it out.

Maybe not to the point of \"spam.\" But if there's a donation reminder every so often, and an ad when you join the server, so be it. That's the price you pay to keep Community alive.\n\n>Admins massive ego baning pretty much anyone they don't like.\n\nServers with bad admins won't last. People won't play them.

Maybe a toggle for \"default map rotation\" or something...\n\n>Bottom line, if you think valve doesn't care enough to put an anti cheat then i don't see how they would care enough to revamp the community server browser\n\nMy idea revolves around Valve's apathy being related to \"treadmill work\" like the anticheat. If that's not why they don't care, then my idea falls apart. I'm just praying they'll jump at the chance to stop working on TF2 *and* keep making money ***and*** stop the bad PR.",

            "Then please spread the word.\n\nLook at the mess FixTF2 has become. We have to promote alternatives."
