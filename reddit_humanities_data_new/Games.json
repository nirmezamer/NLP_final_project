            "**final fantasy VII rebirth**. have put in some 20-30 hours into this since last i wrote one or two weeks ago, now reaching 60h total. this game started at a 7/10 the intro hours and have just grown and grown and grown on me, reaching one of my all time favorites. graphics were incredible from the start, cutscenes still blow me away. combat is a personal all-time favorite and still manages to grow. but what suprises me is the journey and characters - I can't remember the last time i was *this* invested in their fates and i'm uncertain how it will end.\n\nto try and boil down my current gameplay experience using analogies is this. take your favorite wild mix of fictional characters. jack sparrow, spider-man, kill bill protagonist and batman. now throw them into a bunch of varied adventures where you get to spend time with and get to know each and every one of them deeper. all the adventures have the same flair as everything, everywhere, all at once - as in that anything can pop up and it zooms from scary to humor to hitting the feels with *wild* props and it *works* because whoever made this knows that ridiculous settings doesn't stand in the way of earnest storytelling one bit - it just adds to it. oh and all of this is happening while you are marching towards a larger-than-life opponent that is being built up like thanos in infinity war.\n\nwith elden ring, i had to take a break for 2 weeks at ~40 hours. here I can't stop playing just as much as i don't want it to end. fucking love this game to bits",
            "**Assassin's Creed Odyssey**\n\nAssassin's Creed Odyssey is a game that does full justice to its name. You play as an assassin and hoo boy, is it certainly an odyssey.\n\nThe first part of that phrase might already have people rearing up. A common complaint of this game is that's not really an Assassin's Creed game. There's too much level-based combat and not enough sneaky killing. I can honestly say I have no clue whatsoever what these people are talking about. One of the most fun parts of my time with Odyssey was arriving at a fort because of a quest, and completely cleaning it out without getting spotted, to the point that I started trolling the remaining soldiers once there were only about five left with shooting arrows at them not to kill, but just to lead them to investigate so I could move around them and shoot arrows at them from another side. I will admit there are some enemies who can take getting backstabbed when they do not seem like it (especially cultists suffer from this), but in general I was never really disappointed at my inability to stealthily kill my enemies, be it with my spear or an arrow to the kn-head.\n\nCombat outside of stealth is a bit of a mixed bag. It certainly looks flashy and cool, but the actual mechanics just resolve into button-mashing and occasionally pressing the counter or dodge button to avoid taking damage, with most of the abilities just having you deal...more damage, rather than really adding a new dimension to the combat. There are some like that, like Shield Breaker which gets rid of enemy shields or the Spartan Kick, which can get enemies away from you (or off a cliff), but they're limited in quantity. The ability tree in general is one of the weaker points of Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Each of the 'classes' (Warrior, Assassin, Hunter) has their own skill tree, but you don't have that many slots in your quickmenu and a lot of the skills just aren't that interesting. It also takes a while for the game to give you anything else to spend your Ability Points on, so you're quickly left with level ups not particularly mattering.\n\nSo if level ups matter little, what other reason is there to fight? Loot maybe? Odyssey certainly provides an outrageous amount of loot but again very little of it actually worthwile. You'll know what treasure chests or enemies hold loot that is worth your attention, but what to do with the rest? You can sell it, but money only really matters if you want to upgrade your ship to the later levels as that gets expensive rather quickly. You don't need to buy equipment because you get it all for free. You can upgrade or engrave your equipment to give it special abilities, but those are generally cheap enough that you'll get by on quest rewards. You can disassemble them for crafting supplies which you'll certainly need for your ship or to make arrows. But generally, you'll be left with a lot of inventory management.\n\nThere are plenty of other gameplay elements to consider. One is the mercenary system; be a bad enough Alexios or Kassandra and soldiers will put a bounty on you, which will be pursued by mercenaries (misthios in the Ancient Greek world) who are capable warriors who can easily give you a run for your money. Aside from a few story beats, there's nothing really stopping you from just paying off your bounty however as the mercenaries as well will mostly be more trouble than they're worth. Beating mercenaries gives you a loot and lets you rise through the mercenary ranks, which gives a few benefits like discounts, the most interesting of these being cheaper ship crafting. There's also conquering battles. Each section of the Greek world is ruled by a certain leader who serves a faction (Greek or Spartan, as Odyssey takes place during the Peloponnesian War). Hassle these leaders enough by killing soldiers, burning crops, looting money and killing the leaders and you can unlock an all-out war where you can support either the defending or attacking side. These are all pretty much a chore, as you're just locked into battling a bunch of enemies on a timer which makes it more baffling that you have it do it several times in the main quest. And then there's ship battles. Once you have your ship, you are free to attack whoever you want; Spartans, Athenians, merchants, pirates. Pirates will always attack you if they see you. The ship battles are cool visually and there's definitely a sense of tension as you're never as in control as you are when it's just you in melee combat, but there's also a sense of basically spamming the attack button and then bracing yourself when the enemy goes in for an attack. There's a little more tactics as it's more viable and easy to isolate a ship (as pirates sail in packs) but it's not a huge strategic process.\n\nSo, why go through all this? Well, your main character (Kassandra or Alexios, your choice) goes through it because they are a misthios. After a few succesful missions on the base island of Kephallonia, they are recruited by a wealthy Athenian who wants them to kill a Spartan general on Megaris. You quickly find out this Spartan general is actually your father who threw you off a cliff when you were just a child. After proving yourself to the Spartans by doing several missions, you get to confront him. You deal with him and he tells you to find your mother, who also survived. But first you must head to Phokis to deal with the Athenian. After doing some missions where you confront the Oracle of Delphi, you find out an evil cult is manipulating the Ancient Greek world, and this cult has also raised and corrupted your sibling to fight for them. They head to Athens for more information, where they must first prove themselves to Perikles, the leader of Athens, by doing several missions. More information can be gained from speaking to a pirate queen, but she wants something in return for giving you this information, like money or help with several missions. I'm sure the pattern is quite visible at this point, and anyone who has already played the game knows I could go on for every single main story mission in this game. It is common that people want something in return if they give or do something for you, but Odyssey drives it to outrageous new heights. It would be one thing if these could be resolved in one mission, but there are always multiple things that must be accomplished before you are allowed to make progress.\n\nSo why do it as a player? Well, Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a great adventure. As much as I slagged off the combat, there is a certain satisfying element to it, whether you finally land the kill on an enemy in out-and-out combat or as you finally take down the last enemy in a camp or fort where nobody had any idea you were ever even there. It's fun to meet characters like Sokrates, and Greece is absolutely jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Athens is one of those cities where it is near impossible to not just stare mouth agape at the statues and building that fill the city-state. There are some NPCs that are just delightful to interact with, like Kyra, Daphnae, Phoibe, Marcos, Alkibiades, Barnabas,... And there are story elements that really hit home too. The reunion with the player's mother is a beautiful scene, where a lot of attention was put into little details, little emotions, little movements by the characters that really drive home a feeling of immersion.\n\nThe flaws do revolve around there just being too much of this game. Opening the world map for the first time will overwhelm you. Growing up with jRPGS, I was raised with the idea of always going the wrong path first before heading down progress. But what is the wrong path or the progress path here? Will the game lead me to all these different islands (it does, for the vast majority of them at least)? And then there's all the aforementioned gameplay elements, that certainly add flavour to the game but also feel incomplete, ideas that sprung up in a developer's mind but never got the time to really be refined into systems and proper parts of the game.\n\nShould you play Assassin's Creed Odyssey? Yes. Even just getting into Athens will provide a solid, exciting experience. In the worst case scenario, Odyssey can teach you a lesson: how to say no. It is really about deciding not to engage with certain elements of the game. Not taking on every quest; the game has a dialogue system. Kassandra or Alexios can perfectly be played to not do certain things for certain people (my Kassandra never did any of the alpha animal locations or Daughters of Artemis). It helps with the immersion, which can hit at any point. Near the end of the game, I was making my way over to a quest objective (on foot, as I dislike mounts in 95 % of games that have them), when I heard one of the passive NPC musicians playing my favourite sea shanty (The Lost Shield). I stopped, and listened.\nThe song was cut short when a soldier on horseback got confused with his pathing and ran into her, after which she composed herself but began another song. It's about running to another quest objective and stopping yourself because you realize, panning the camera to the right, that there is an exquisite view of whatever island you are currently on, and you just have to take a moment to take it all in...to imagine how people lived on this land, and what their hopes and dreams and fear were.\n\nAnd then realizing you only have half an hour of gametime left and you should probably finish that quest so you got something done. Live and learn.",
            "Just rolled credits on **Cyberpunk 2077** after about 75 hours. Did all possible side content + Phantom Liberty. \n\nIt\u2019s really one of the best games I\u2019ve ever played. I never bought it at release but with all the updates and the expansion, today in 2024 it\u2019s an incredible experience. The story and characters are so well done, and the world of Night City is the most compelling and immersive I\u2019ve come across since Skyrim. The gameplay is fun as hell. I went with a pretty generic Assault rifle build, but all the cyberware and upgrades, where I just slow down time, dash between targets with a katana as a supplementary, and melt people in 2-3 shots is just a blast. \n\nIt\u2019s top tier from a technical standpoint as well: The visuals on my PS5/OLED combo are jaw dropping. Voice acting and music are all fantastic. \n\nThe ending is a bit of a downer but it felt appropriate for the bleak, hopeless world CDPR presented. \n\nI have serious gaming hangover now and have no idea what\u2019s gonna scratch this itch.\n\nNext up on PS5 is **Baldurs Gate 3**. I\u2019ve never played this kind of game before so I\u2019m a little nervous but it seems to be beginner friendly from what I read\n\nOn Steam Deck I\u2019m about to start **Yakuza 0**. First experience with that series as well.",
            "I just want to say that I can't believe I've been sleeping on dwarf fortress for so long. This game is exactly what I've always\u00a0 wanted to play. Of course, the steam version's qol improvements helped me massively.\u00a0",
            "**Elden Ring**\n\nStarted a month ago with a fresh character in preparation of the DLC. Finally finished the game after failing to do so with my first character (mage) back from release. I am all set up with 100 of each smithing stone, 80 of each somber smithing stone. \n\nAfter that I went back to my first character and brought him up to speed. Finished Mohg to have access to the DLC, also finished the game while fully embracing jolly coop. will take him to lvl160 probably to have a night comet build with a good side of faith ready. Depending on how my week goes I might just start NG+ with him to get the magic scorpion charm. Apparently I finished Ranni's questline before Seluvis'. \n\nOverall I am pretty hyped for the DLC. Can't wait to dive in.",
            "**Elden Ring**\n\nSo I started my new guy about a month ago with the intent of doing more stuff \"in order\", hitting as many quests as I could, and being all ready for the DLC by release. I have successfully kept up with pretty much every questline I wanted to, but I am NOT close to being ready for the DLC. I didn't realize just how much stuff there is in this game if you treat questlines like they're part of the critical path! It's not just \"go here and talk to this guy\". You're completing large optional areas and killing a bunch of bosses. Fia and Ranni's quests are really tightly woven and touch on a ton of other NPC quests. I just did Sellen's and I had no idea it touched so many other NPCs in the game. Hitting all these feels like it turns Elden Ring's \"mysterious and lore based\" story into an overt and narrative one about different forces competing since the days of Merika to claim the Elden Throne and the future for themselves. And eventually you have to pick one to support from the throne.\n\nI decided to try building around the Executioner's Greatsword, and hitting stuff with the giga drill breaker feels *good*. I've added in enough faith for dragon miracles and I'm having a grand ol time smacking stuff around with these big-ass moves.\n\nHowever as far as game progress, I'm only at Mt. Gelmir. I've got to pick up the pace to be ready to play this DLC even vaguely close to release date.",
            "I got Immortals of Aveum via PS+ and I\u2019ve been playing that. It\u2019s decent but definitely not something I would have paid full price for. I\u2019m almost done with the main story but I\u2019m not interested enough to go back and get 100%\n\nAfter I\u2019m done I\u2019m going to start playing Elden Ring again so I can remember how everything works before Shadow of the Erdtree comes out on Friday.",
            "**Pumpkin Jack + Costume Quest**\n\nWas listening to the soundtrack of FF9 and Devils Ambition played. It really made me feel a Halloween vibe so I went to go play these. Man. We need more Halloween themed games.",
            "I've wrapped up **Ghostwire: Tokyo** and it was...good, pretty good in few moments. I think main issue with a game is it has a very small window where it all \"clicks\". At the start combat is a problem. Very repetitive and just boring, with lack of cool powers and variety of enemies. So it's, in short, a slog. You smack and smack same attack on same enemies until the dawn of time. Later on when game does pick it up, you unlock new powers and more enemies appear, problem lies within story. It's...boring. Somehow it doesn't even feel like an actual main story. Game has very, very few main quests that are very forgettable. and to extend the playtime it forces you to engage with open world activities like clearing out the map out of fog to reach another mission. Akito is an okay character, KK was not that bad but I still didn't feel their dynamic. They just..worked together and bam, at one point they are buddies. I however can admit ending is surprisingly emotional and that took me off guard in a good way. Best part of the game is open world, when you just say \"eh these main missions boring, time to explore\". Navigating empty streets and rooftops, getting more knowledge and just interracting with different creatues, enemies, learning about folklore, legends and all that in Japan setting that not often gets mentioned, it was really fun. Most of the side quests was also pretty solid! So yeah ultimately when game clicks, when you explore the streets, engage with enemies in different ways, it's damn good. But that window is very tight. Nonetheless I can recommend the game! \n\nAs for my Wasteland DC adventures in **Fallout 3**, level 25, now starting to wonder if I can legit 100 all skills, as I already got...Small Guns, Speech, Medicine, Lockpick, Repair, Science and Barter on 100, with Energy Guns on 90. Rocking so many weapons I have no idea what to use. Unique Combat Shotty here, Unique Plasma Rifle there, still having a blast but no enemies are a danger anymore. Cleared out...I would say 70% of the map. Whole southwest is done, DC has only few chunks left that I have to reach by Metro stations, now I'm at Republic of Dave, along the way I wrapped up Nuka Cola quest, Tempenny Tower quest, the one with Superheroes, and slaves. So now I get a key from Dave to finish Heads quest, afterwards move towards Vault 92 to get Agatha's Quest done.",
            "**Megaman IV** (Gameboy NSO)\n\n\nNot really a ton to say about these games. I like when Megaman games allow you to explore the stages using Robot Master weapons, so Napalm Man's stage was really cool. This game feels real easy until suddenly in Wily's Castle, it isn't, so I didn't quite finish it this week.\n\n\n\n**Mario & Rabbids: Kingdom Battle** (Switch)\n\n\nI love this XCOM-lite, and have been meaning to try and finish it for years. I feel each world is going on just a tad too long, but thanks to the glut of coins you get for doing a good job, I've been unlocking new weapons at a good clip.\n\n\nAll of the weapon effects feel quite basic but effective, and unlike regular XCOM I don't feel particularly robbed when an effect doesn't proc, or a shot misses, what with probabilities being 100, 50, or 0%. The main draw here is how fluid it all feels to control, and the movement is incredible. It's been unendingly rewarding to slide tackle a small chain of rabbids, and set up a team mate to help boost jump me onto an enemy's head that's on higher ground, setting up a powered-up high ground shot, seeing the bounce effect proc and that triggering another team mate to reflex shot as the enemy flies past them. This might be my favourite Ubisoft game since AC Brotherhood.\n\n\n\n**Final Fantasy XI** (PC)\n\n\nStill playing this but have been slower this week - it feels like even the early game has a fair bit of grind, and I got to a point where I picked up a main quest I now can't progress past without starting a party or completing a quest that opens up another route into the area that would otherwise require a party of real players.\n\n\nHowever in order to unlock that side quest, I need to raise my fame in my city to the highest rank (that actually unlocks anything), to do which I need to do side quests in another city that is not advertised without the wiki, and those side quests look like they're all real life time gated...? I know I could literally just look for 2 other players to help me out for like, 5 minutes, which I'm starting to lean toward. An insanely obtuse game, but I'm still enjoying the story enough, or more to the point intrigued about the story to come, to carry on.\n\n\n\nI've unlocked another couple of jobs - Ranger and Paladin so far. I've levelled Ranger a little and enjoyed it, but just whilst trying to beat my way past through the main story I went back to BLM/RDM as my main/support combo. Will try to unlock some more and mess around with them, but I'm really just waiting for Blue Mage to become available. I don't expect to play a lot of this next week due to doing a lot of travelling.",
            "Spending months on **Red Dead 2** mainly just roaming and doing side activities. I assumed I wouldn't like it from the commentary about how much time Arthur takes to do animations but it's insignificant compared with the time required to get places.  I don't understand the complaint at all. I'll advance the story when I am ready but not there yet.\n\nOtherwise some demos:\n\n**Preserve** Up on NextFest.  Found this fairly engaging as a tile based life sim (?) where you get points for building habitable land for plants and animals.  Mostly based around connect 3 type design.\n\n**Chillquarium**.  Fish collecting game.  Got several days with this as mostly an idle game.  Demo is limited in aquarium and biome selection but kind of rudimentary.  But retail price is under $6 so hard to complain.\n\n**Metal Slug Tactics**.  Overall a \"no\" from me.  Very small zones.  Play emphasizing special moves triggered by using your generate events.  Feels more like a puzzle game than emergent situations you need to  respond to.  Very polished but not my thing.\n\n**Neoproxima**.  Visual novel about a exploring ruins on a distant planet.  The narrative reminded me of Outer Wilds: if you die you respawn and you have the same lore screen.  But the gameplay was more like In Other Waters.  My backlog may be too big but may keep an eye on it.",
            "High on Life\n\nI'm really glad I stuck with this. While the beginning is a pretty generic FPS with a rick & morty aesthetic, it really found its footing for me in the second half of the game to make me continue and end up really liking it. For starters, the game just starts and feels pretty generic. The combat doesn't really feel all that special and Kenny's special skill wasn't something I found much use for. The game, despite having a more unique aesthetic among other video games, also has drab, boring looking environments at first. The slums especially seemed so boring compared to the hub city. And i also felt the use of Justin roiland was mishandled. I get it, he and what he's created is the draw of the game. But, for me, his voice being the first major character you meet and are in contact with the entire game was an issue because it just made me feel the game was an extension of rick and morty instead of being something that stands on its own. It's especially hard to separate since he's just using his morty voice for the character. That being said, once the game really opens up and you start to have multiple gun characters, the game gets a lot better. \n\nFirstly, introducing different gun characters added some much needed variability to the humor of the game. At first, it felt like a below average episode of rick and morty. Some of the humor felt forced and at times, unoriginal from what it was clearly inspired by. But new guns bring new personalities and that helped a lot because they, to me, felt very distinct from one another. New dimensions to the humor which helps the jokes land better later in the game. The new guns also bring better abilities which add a good deal of variability to the combat so its not so generic and one note. I also really enjoyed them making fun villains and creating scenarios which were much more unique compared to the first half of the game in how you deal with and defeat the bosses. And they also managed to \"sequel bait\" successfully! I really loved how the left something hanging for us to ponder while we wait for more from the universe. Definitely left me interested in where the story goes from here. Lastly, the story and characters, while not amazing, are good enough to tell a satisfying story and see your characters grow enough to make the journey of the game worth it. \n\nAnyways, all in all, it's a good game. It starts generic and slow and the humor doesn't hit. But eventually, you open things up whether through more characters or more combat options and things improve. The humor becomes more varied so it begins to hit better. The story comes together nicely. Character motivations become clear and they all have a decent arc. And lastly, despite missing some variability, the art direction is clear and unique for gaming. In the end, it's a great 8/10 kind of game.  Not one I'd go out of my way to promote but one I enjoyed and felt didn't waste my time and would say if you like rick and morty or even have a passing interest based on trailers, should play. \n\nYakuza 5\n\nOh man, it feels so good to be back lol this is my longest break from the series so I was getting a bit ancy to get to the next game but I'm glad I waited because I'm so far loving it. Only 12 hours in and still in kiryus section but it's been real good so far. I'm intrigued by the story and what's going on with the tojo and why they are in Fukuoka. And taxi cab driver kiryu is so much fun. Such a chill, fun side story and might be one of my favorites in the series so far. I also LOVE the ramen mini game. It blows my mind how RGG manages to make their side content always feel so fresh. It's still early but I'm really just glad to be back in the world of yakuza. Can't wait to play more.",
            "**Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous (PC - turn-based mode)**\n\nHaving a great time with this one - it has an especially strong beginning in Acts 1 and 2. Within 5 minutes of starting, a massive demon appears and annihilates a powerful good guy. Then you\u2019re limited to a linear dungeon or two, which then opens up into a city, which then opens up to a limited crusade mode / world map. It\u2019s only really in Act 3 that the game world & crusade mode opens up fully.\n\nPoint being, it\u2019s great design of escalating freedom and choice.\n\nWhich is important because the Pathfinder system is complex and well-developed, so just leveling up characters already offers an almost anxiety-inducing amount of options. If you want to have optimized characters (necessary on higher difficulty levels), you really have to put in some reading / research. Once you learn the basics, though, it\u2019s really not that bad, and on lower difficulties, it\u2019s perfectly valid to design characters based on roleplay.\n\nI remember reading a ton of reviews for the first game (Kingmaker) that complained about how complex making and leveling up characters was, and it made me genuinely mad. Almost every other game is designed first and foremost with ease of consumption in mind. It\u2019s gotta be simple, to sell to the greatest number of people. So I was mad to see so many criticizing that rare example of complexity - I was worried Owlcat would listen.\n\nWell, happy to say Owlcat not only didn\u2019t simplify anything, they added a whole complex system on top (mythic paths). Thank goodness. I love cRPGs, and I\u2019d rank Wrath of the Righteous top five for sure. Not BG2 levels - but then nothing else that I've played comes close.\n\nAs a larger point, this year in gaming has taught me (and it\u2019s so obvious in hindsight) that the best games are those built upon some other foundation: remakes, sequels, adaptations, etc. Dead Space Remake was great. Elden Ring was the culmination of FromSoftware iterating on the same design it began with DemonSouls. BG3 not only is a sort of spiritual sequel to D:OS but has the DnD5e system. And now here Wrath of the Righteous is built upon the Pathfinder system. As a long-time creative writer/editor, I know it\u2019s just so much easier to build off pre-existing ideas, systems, foundations than to have to create everything from scratch.\n\nMeanwhile, all the biggest flops (Suicide Squad, Redfall, etc) are games whose studios were asked to make something they\u2019ve never made before.\n\nAs much as I\u2019m a little disappointed by the \u2018remake culture\u2019 we have going on in our entertainment industry right now, I have to admit that - for gaming especially - it\u2019s leading to some strong games.",
            "**Final Fantasy XIV**\n\nI've spent the last couple weeks going through the post-Endwalker quests and cleaning up some outstanding sidequests. There's some stuff to like in the post-expansion story. The interactions between >!Zero and the rest of the cast!< were fun, and they put a surprising amount of work into new playable-ish areas for a patch quest series. I soured on it near the end, though, because it felt like they were trying to hit the same high notes as the Shadowbringers/Endwalker finales but didn't put in the work to earn them.\n\n>!Golbez!< was a terrible villain, and the *OMG huge reveal* >!that the real Golbez was dead and we'd been up against Durante all along!< fell completely flat because I'd been given absolutely no reason to care about either character. \">!Some rando got a lucky shot in on my friend and now I'm pissed at the world!<\" is not a very compelling villain backstory. The protagonists are also pretty stupid for not trying to >!reason with him!< earlier, since their >!goals weren't even remotely incompatible!<. It would have been straightforward to set up >!a well-guarded portal between the 13th and the source and let any voidsent who wanted to die come through, especially since they had access to a sealing device that was strong enough to hold the ultimate incarnation of darkness!<. If nothing else, I'm satisfied with how strongly they emphasize that >!Y'shtola's #1 imperative is still cracking the problem of inter-reflection travel so we can go have awesome adventures in other dimensions!<, and this storyline definitely brings us closer to that goal.\n\nOn the other hand, the Endwalker alliance raid quest line was very entertaining.

I have to respect the absolute nerve of the developers for >!spending Shadowbringers insisting that a Hildibrand quest wouldn't make sense because how would he even get to the First, only to have that be exact place you find him in Endwalker!<. My only disappointment was that the final fight >!was a trial against some generic war god, and not a solo duty against a primal-sized version of your own character model!<.\n\nI also went back and did the Werlyt questline from Shadowbringers, and I certainly did not expect to >!become a mech pilot!< but I ain't complaining.

Watching that one scientist's reaction when he realized that >!the peon he'd assigned to make cat toys was in fact the hero that saved what's left of the universe!< was peak self-aware MMO writing.\n\nModerately high hopes for Dawntrail. I like the characters I've been introduced to so far, and I'm hoping the last zone or two throw some >!Azys Lla/Amaurot/Elpis/Ultima Thule!<-like curveballs. Still deciding what class I want to play. I've got RDM/WHM/WAR at 90, and I'm working on leveling NIN/BRD/SGE at the moment, though I'll probably drop SGE at 80. Between Phlegma >!balls, lol!< and Eukrasia, it feels very awkward to play. Given how trivial healing is in FFXIV, sticking with the class that has the easiest and most comfortable toolkit for it (WHM) makes more sense to me. Maybe I'll revisit the other healers if they do a big healing rework in a future patch.",
            "**Dragon Age Inquisition**. I had forgotten how much I LOVE the combat in this game. I know I'm a weirdo, I don't know why I like it so much. I normally hate RTWP. But I love the balance of tactical and action in Inquisition. Battlemaster skills especially. I'm a warrior bard!\n\nThe only problem is that Inquisition categorically refuses to work with my PS4 controller, so I have to use my xbox gamepad with a broken RB. That's so annoying.",
            "**Monster Hunter World**\n\nFirst monster hunter game, I think what surprises me the most is how emergent this can get, and how environmental details supplement that. Stuff like running for my life, going through a smallish corridor and watching the monster chasing me get tangled up in some vines. And the turf wars!! I had no idea going in just how epic this game could be sometimes, off of gameplay alone. I hear Wilds has seamless transitions into and out of bases, which sounds mind blowing compared to World\u2019s way of doing things. I\u2019m only 20 hours in, but I sort of understand now why the series has such staying power. I expect to be chipping away at this one for a looong time.",
            "I've been playing Destiny 2 The Final Shape and the Valorant console beta! I was a day 1 Destiny (and Destiny 2) player, but haven't kept up with all the content through the years. I've been enjoying my time with The Final Shape though. I'm also surprised at how good Valorant feels on a console. Having played it for a while on PC I was skeptical that I'd be able to make the transition, but I'm digging it so far.",
            "**The Banner Saga** is a game that seems like it really ought to be right up my alley but I tried it a year or two ago and just a few days back and it's not for me. I like the setting and the illustrations and the story telling from multiple points of view. But I just don't like what they've done with the tactics gameplay which is really the meat of the game. Primarily it's the turn order that bothers me.\n\n\nRather than team phases or unit order of speed/etc. each side has a pre-set unit order and then the teams take turns in that order. But if a unit is defeated then their turn is just passed to the next unit in order, so if a team has ABCD units and C dies then the order is just ABD and effectively ABD just act faster now. Defeating it doesn't deny the enemy any actions - and since a character's strength is both it's health and ability to do damage (so when you lose health you do less damage, neat for the setting but less so the mechanics) arguably I think it's better to just weaken whatever you engage first but not outright kill them so they act as 'dead weight' so to speak as they'll do comparatively little damage and body block other enemies. It's an interesting system and definitely makes it feel different from other tactics games but I was not having much fun. Further I think it's counterintuitive playing around keeping enemies alive and that making a kill can actually be a net negative. I also think it tends to give you poor starting positions and I don't like that many battles are seemingly 'inconsequential' in that if you lose it just means you take injuries/earn less renown, are met with a 'luckily you were able to crawl away from the battlefield' and it just presses on. That probably serves the campaign it wants to create but again it's just not my preference.\n\n**Dead Space (2008)** was alright. The horror elements really didn't do much for me; I don't even have much experience with the genre and it struck me as heavy handed. It certainly made me jump a few times but there was very little subtlety or mystery at any point and it's atmosphere was more 'haunted house' than cause for concern. I did enjoy the gunplay, the plasma cutter is a very cool weapon and being able to re-orient it to a vertical or horizontal alignment was a nice touch. Also the limb destruction is entertaining to watch and I liked how targeting limbs gave it a different feel compared to usually just shooting at center mass or the head in other games. The story was nothing to write home about and despite it only taking about 15 hours it was a drag to finish it. I think the problem is that most of your objectives are functionally indistinguishable from any other - follow the blue line, interact with the shiny object, kill the enemies that spawn and repeat. It had its moments - like getting on the Talon ship and learning why they were there and encountering the creepy fast soldier enemies but ultimately I stuck with it moreso because I knew it couldn't be -that- much longer rather than actually wanting to lol.\n\n**The Pale Beyond** stumbled across this on Steam somehow and gave it a shot because it offered a demo and I ended up really liking it. I'd call it a visual novel meets survival sim set on a voyage to explore Antarctica in ~mid 20th century. Unsurprisingly you have to balance the crew's health, happiness, loyalty, rations, heat and assignments all while dealing with... nearly everything going wrong that could. And not in a humorous way. There are light hearted moments and successes to celebrate from time to time but mostly the game's mood is one of desperate times and desperate measures for a voyage that quickly goes from plenty difficult to practically damned. There are a lot of hard decisions that need to be made in the narrative but the gameplay itself is also an interesting 'word problem' of sorts where each week you have to consider who does what, how to best use your resources and how to recover in the following cycle when someone is inevitably freezing or malnourished or wounded, etc. I think the story and the mechanics work really well together as the resource management gives you the 'nuts and bolts' problems to solve but speaking with the characters might test your intuition or how well you've listened previously. And speaking to those characters is generally quite interesting because a lot of attention has been paid to giving them meaningful personalities beyond just their role on the crew. I would say that true to being Captain on a real vessel the game tests both your hard skills and soft skills in equal measure. \n\nTechnically speaking the game can be a bit wonky - camera panning often doesn't do what you want it to, the UI is sometimes 'behind' if you try to open something before another event/dialogue has finished processing and the save system is just kind of needlessly weird. There also comes a point in the game, which is somewhat alluded to in dialogue but I did not expect it to occur literally, when time starts to pass in larger blocks than you expect which (despite essentially making the game easier because more time passes for the same amount of resources expended) really threw me because I was planning for one thing only for it to end up playing out very differently. Despite that I really enjoyed completing it and will definitely be playing at least once more to try out some alternative decisions and just generally do a better job. Grimley might be a twat but I still want to try to win his loyalty.",
            "Elden Ring - Been at this for over 2 months and 300 hours now. Currently on an NG+3 run with my main character to prep for the DLC and developing five more characters in different classes. I really should stop playing it now and give more time to other games though!\n\nBaldurs Gate 3 - 20 hours in and just rescued Halsin and progress is painstakingly slow thanks to my Elden Ring obsession. I'm loving the game and just getting used to turn based combat systems. But somehow, it just hasn't grabbed me the way ER has so far. Maybe that will change the more I play it.",
            "Gave **Disco Elysium** the old college try for about three hours and I think that's about as far as I'm willing to go. I just don't care for it and there's been no hook. I do like the dialogue system with your intrusive thoughts/faculties contributing what your subconcious has picked up on but it also goes on and on and on and on about the most banal topics - I truly do not need three paragraphs of text explaining why and how the papers on a clipboard that came out of a dumpster are yucky. Some of the detective elements and backstory were sort of interesting as well but they and everything else just sort of coagulated as background noise and nothing stood out to say 'here's something fun and/or interesting to pursue'. It was more of an ambivalent 'well, yeah, you could do that if you, like, wanted to. you know, whatever.' I have a really hard time sticking with games that don't establish some kind of interesting premise to pursue or conflict to address or character to understand and I just wasn't picking up anything that it was putting down.",
            "This week I was playing mostly indie demos and a little bit of AAA.\n\nAmong indie games, the hidden gem for me was Glyphica, it is a typing survival game, the game loop is similar to Vampire Survivors but instead of running and avoiding enemies, you need to type words to attack them, That's an excellent idea IMO.\n\nFinished Wolfenstein The New Order and started playing Wolfenstein The Old Blood. The last time I played a Wolfenstein game it was a return to Castle Wolfenstein and new ones feel like a huge upgrade, but they still have the atmosphere of the old Wolfenstein games. I was surprised by how many references to other Bethesda games Wolfenstein had, Fallout's Nuka cola, Skyrim's helmet, and swords, and it feels so good to find this type of easter eggs.",
            "**Blue Prince**\n\nThis one is a demo with a limit on how much you can play in a run but I got more than 3h before reaching the limit. This is the kind of puzzle game that is 100% going to appear on the best games of the year lists the Christmas after is being released. The guy who made inscription said it\u2019s the best thing he\u2019s played this year. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of inscription but this is definitely shaping to be special. \n\nIt\u2019s difficult to explain the mechanics, but it\u2019s kind of a mix between a traditional adventure game set inside an old mansion mixed with a tabletop game with roguelike mechanics. Each day you have a limited amount of resources and you explore each new room by drawing three blueprint cards out of a random pool of 45 and choosing one, which will determine which type of room will appear. By creating a plan of the mansion you try to reach the secret room 46, which is the end goal.\n\nIt\u2019s very elegantly designed in a similar way to board games like Carcassone, in which there\u2019s a micro and macro component of strategy where you must consider which room and placement is beneficial to you at the moment but also which long term effects it has during your run. It\u2019s not merely a board game though, there\u2019s full 3D navigation, item searching, puzzle solving and the usual mechanics in an adventure game. The concept is interesting but to me it\u2019s the execution that makes the game great. Plenty of new things to discover and consider each day and plenty of mysteries that live in the back of your head while playing. But so far it never felt too much, the amount of info you get each day is the right amount to keep you interested. \n\nOnly bad thing about this demo is that I want to play the rest of the game and there\u2019s not a release date yet, so be warned. But definitely keep this game in mind for the future because I\u2019m convinced it will be a success.",
            "(Copying the first bit from a comment I made on another post)\n\nFinished **Remnant: From the Ashes** on PC through Game Pass. I really enjoyed it and it was definitely better than my expectations. The combat is great and fairly challenging. The bosses were suitably difficult, I died enough times that finally beating them was actually satisfying.  The atmospheres of all the various worlds you visit were interesting.  The game is mainly known for being like Dark Souls with guns, I haven't played Dark Souls or any similar games but I found the mechanics to be generally intuitive for a beginner to the genre. You get a lot of useful levelling up options but they are mostly 'stat goes up 2%' so not the most exciting.\n\nCriticisms - The final boss was a bit  rubbish and very unintuitive without a guide. The campaign worlds are procedurally generated and you don't see everything on one playthrough, so I don't know if I've missed any fun bosses but I would rather move on than reroll campaign worlds. Also the game has a loot problem imo. You get given loads of interesting weapons from killing bosses but by the time you get them you've already levelled up your original weapons a lot. Yeah a crossbow with bleed damage is cool but I've already upgraded my shotgun 10 times so I'll just stick with that. Maybe it's different on higher difficulties but on normal I beat the entire campaign with the original heavy armour, original shotgun, original hunting rifle and a revolver you unlock very early on so the loot was unexciting. Also there doesn't seem to\n\nThe game took me about 10 hours my count, just focusing on beating the campaign. Considering I didn't specifically pay for it and that I went in with lowish expectations I'd give it a solid 8/10\n\nAs per suggestions on another post I've got Remnant II installed but haven't tried it yet.\n\nOn PS5 I've started **Journey to the Savage Planet** (PS Plus) which based on 1 and a half hours I have mixed feelings about. The gameplay is pretty fun. It's like a more linear not randomly generated No Man's Sky in that your main goal is to explore a planet, scan all the animals and plants, and gather resources to build better gear.\n\nMy issue is the humour. The live action adverts and messages are pretty funny, no complaints there. However you have a very chirpy but brutally honest AI constantly making snarky comments about everything. The comments can be funny but there's no break from them. It's like playing Fallout New Vegas but Yes Man is following you around and making jokes every 5 seconds.",
            "**Phantom Dust** - a beloved 2004 xbox title that was rereleased for free on Xbox/PC in 2017. You can still play this game for free downloading it from the microsoft store, and while its old, It really has a lot to love. Essentially the game is a card system, although it doesnt look like it. You build a deck of 30 cards called an arsenal, and you battle your opponent in realtime in a 3D environment, using your cards to attack and defend yourself. The game is very old so you definitely feel it in the clunkier movement and long end-lag of moves, but theres still a charm to it. The atmosphere, character designs, level designs, and music feel pretty impressively unique, and with over 300 cards to customize your deck with theres quite a bit of strategy and decision making. Would love to see more people check the game out.",
            "**The Quarry (PS5)**\n\nStill currently going through The Quarry. Just finished a playthrough where I kept everyone alive. Now I'm going through and trying to kill everyone. My sentiments are the same last week.\n\nThe Good:\n\n* The characters: I've played through Until Dawn and The Quarry, and to me, the characters in the Quarry are better than the characters in Until Dawn. They actually exist to serve a purpose, not just fill the role of an archetype like in Until Dawn. Yeah they talk like how boomer thinks 20-somethings talk, but the performances (save for a couple) make up for it\n* Graphics: As expressed last week, this is a beautiful game. There are certain points where it doesn't even look like I'm playing a game and instead am watching a movie. There are a couple issues, especially with Emma's mouth, but overall, beautiful looking game and all the environments feel unique.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n* Interactivity: Yes the choices you make actually do impact the story. But a lot of what you are doing is just walking from A to B with the occasional quick time event and shooting segment. Most of the game play will be spent watching cutscenes with a brief decision to make. And for some people, that's great, but for me, I would like a little more gameplay. It's not enough to sour me on the game entirely, but it would be nice to have more to do than just walk around.",
            "**Nioh 2**\n\nThe first boss of DLC3 was fucking brutal goddamn. The final boss of the first mission was a joke in comparison.

            "Had a combination of a bad sinus infection and a freak accident with one of my cerebral palsy treatments (I had it fixed on Friday and I\u2019m recovering at home now) so it led to me being laid up and playing **Pok\u00e9mon shining pearl** anytime I wasn\u2019t sleeping. I completed what normally a 25 to 30 hour run that would take me around two weeks in three days as a result. I completed a psychic type only run (including the legendary Pok\u00e9mon Jirachi and Mew). \n\nThis one was pretty cool, with my team starting and staying strong the whole game. The elite four was fairly annoying though. A lot of times I didn\u2019t have types to help if I wasn\u2019t at an outright disadvantage. So I had to rely on moves only and since the elite four has optimized teams they were pretty tough and I lost a few times. Cynthia came down to stalling with items, but it\u2019s far from the first time that happened and I got lucky with affection bonuses. \n\nMy next run is probably normal type, but there\u2019s only a few types left before the game stops playing nice and it gets a lot harder due to less Pok\u00e9mon being available or just not being good types overall. I\u2019m planning on using other Pok\u00e9mon as assists so I don\u2019t drive myself crazy. I know it\u2019s technically not a type solo run if that happens. But they will get a proper team showcase in my 100% run against the Elite Four, whenever that is.\n\nNeedless to say, **Mario Kart 8 DX** is getting postponed a bit. Not sure when I\u2019ll be well enough to do that, but I was playing CTR within a few days of my last procedure for my treatment (a routine one, and I was healthy otherwise), so it might not be too long. Probably nothing crazy and just gathering coins automatically for a while, but we\u2019ll see.\n\nOtherwise, a game I would like to finish up  while recuperating is **Mercenaries Wings: The False phoenix.** I beat the first ending years ago, and what I consider to be the better ending. But the game unfortunately requires grinding even on the easiest level and I didn\u2019t want to deal with that second time. But now I\u2019m looking back at doing the second ending after a long break, and potentially the first again now then I know more. It\u2019s not the best game in existence, but it is solid tactics game and pretty fun. Not to mention it\u2019s one that doesn\u2019t require too much thought.",

            "**Destiny 2: The Final Shape**\n\nI know that this sub can be a toxic battlefield when it comes to Destiny, but I want to gush anyway, because Bungie really did knock it out of the park here. I wouldn't recommend TFS as a reason to get into or return to Destiny, but as a longtime fan of this franchise, I am beyond pleased that they actually stuck the landing. From a narrative and gameplay perspective, the campaign is leaps and bounds the best that Bungie has ever put out. The tone *finally* returns to those almost cosmic horror undertones that drew me to the universe of Destiny 1 in the first place. The new subclass and weapons have been unique enough to make experimenting with the new toys feel exciting. The raid is an absolute masterclass, feeling like a genuine gauntlet and with the 4th raid encounter Verity being genuinely one of the coolest things I've ever done in *any* video game. And the finale mission manages to truly feel like a climactic, triumphant godslaying conclusion to the entire saga. \n\nIts just \"satisfying.\" And for such a long journey with this series, that's no small feat. Bungie truly did make something worthy here. Its only made \"bittersweet\" by the recent layoffs, and knowing that so many responsible for making it are no longer there and won't contribute to the future of the IP, however that ends up looking.",
            "I've been playing through the Etrian Odyssey games recently. Last week beat 3 HD and now I'm working on Untold. I plan to go through all of them but we'll see how far I make it. Lately, I've been pretty uninterested in most games coming out. Not like \"games these days are all bad\" just the games haven't caught my interest except FF7 Rebirth. So it's nice to try my hand at some older games. When I decided on trying out a dungeon crawler I first tried A Bard's Tale but those might be a bit too old school for me and I couldn't find a groove that felt fun and dropped off after about 8 hours.\n\n  \nThe Etrian games are real fun to me though. I really enjoy making builds of the characters. In 3 the Sovereign class was great since a bunch of their skills could go to making my trips into the dungeon last longer. And the series staple of drawing your own map is great. I played 3 HD on switch mostly portable to use the touch screen because the controller UI for maps was awful. That's why I didn't go to 1 HD and instead went to my 3DS for Untold. \n\nAll in all it's a series I've always flirted with (and bought and started most of the games) since the start but it wasn't until last week I've actually beat one of them and now I finally have the time to go back and finish them. If modern games want to all be the same action game with lackluster, bolted-on rpg elements then I'll just go and play a real rpg to sate my desire.",

            "I started playing **Hogwarts Legacy** last week. I was not a Harry Potter fan growing up, but this game looked pretty cool, and a friend let me borrow it, so I was excited to try it. I'm about 10 hours in so far, and have been focusing largely on the main quests rather than exploration.\n\nThere's a lot to be happy with. The game is very professional and fits in with other open-ish modern games (especially remembering the older era of book/movie tie-ins that were almost always not great). Combat is fun enough, and the classes are surprisingly interesting (I don't love having to do certain tasks before follow-up quests though). If I were an HP fan, I know I'd be totally engrossed in Hogwarts itself, as the school is super detailed and has tons to find. I also love flying around on the brooms.\n\nI do have a few gripes though. Firstly, this game must have the worst fast-travel system I've ever seen. I find it near impossible to actually use the map of the school to correctly select which fast travel point I should be going to. If you memorize the names of the relevant parts of the school, it's marginally better, but they either should have done a 2D model of the school that lets you switch floors, or they maybe should have considered a flatter layout when designing Hogwarts.\n\nAlso, I have never loved how many mechanics games throw at you. I find this game is guilty of it. There are so many spells, and I basically use the same 5-8 of them during combat. Different ones are useful for exploration outside of combat, but I feel like I can't memorize all of the spell names (and there are more spells than there are buttons to assign them to). Then there are other mechanics like catching and feeding animals, upgrading armour, and a couple others that I can't really remember, except that they introduce you to them once, and then I haven't found any other opportunities to do them.\n\nI can't decide if I like the story or not. The first hour of the game was super boring, but after you get integrated into Hogwarts, revisiting that element of the story isn't as bad. I don't feel like the non-Hogwarts parts are super fun, but I also don't think the game would be satisfying if all you did was attend classes.",
            "**Minesweeper**. For some reason it helps me think having that going on in the background.\n\n**LoZ:Tears of The Kingdom**. Scratches the same compulsive/completionist itch that Minesweeper does. They're both about overcoming bite-size problems that are just open-ended and hard enough to be mentally stimulating, while not becoming frustrating. The difference is in presentation and vibes, because this is truly a beautiful and moving game. The gameplay loop releases a drip-feed of dopamine, while the music, sights, and story engage you on a deeper level. Not quite as good as Breath of The Wild, but close.\n\n**Cliffhorse**. A game made by notch about a decade ago that I find weirdly addictive, which I've been playing since the day it came out. Technically it has no built in objective, but I like to push the ball around with the horse, and try to get the ball as high up as I can. I also like to push the ball around predetermined circuits around the map as fast and as smoothly as possible. I'm probably the world's #1 competitive Cliffhorse player, and probably the game's only competitive player. There is something here, and it's a shame notch released it as a \"joke\" game and didn't develop it further. I've probably played this more than Minecraft, but less than Minesweeper. Is this emergent gameplay?",
            "Demos Demos Demos and backlog. Once again I've just been trying to fill in the time for the wait to Shadow of the Erdtree. Last week it was Mafia 2 which was a grand ol time. Now I'm checking out some demos from the next fest.\n\nThe first one I tried was **Flintlock: Siege of Dawn**. I found it to be thoroughly subpar and have no interest in it despite being a day 1 gamepass offering. I wrote a bit more detailed writeup [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1dcu5o2/the_demo_for_flintlock_the_siege_of_dawn_is_now/l823f20/) if you're interested. Seems like some people enjoy it but a lot of people are heavily turned off.\n\nSecond demo I checked out was **Enotria: The Last Song**. Also thoroughly mediocre but at least it isn't suffering from an identity crisis and garbage forspoken tier writing. It's just your bog standard jank af soulslike with a new idea or two. Some people might enjoy this sort of thing but it mostly just feels like a waste of time to me.\n\nThe last demo I've been trying out is not from this next fest but is still available. I actually have had it downloaded for some time and been meaning to play it but I kept forgetting about it. It is **Octopath Traveler 2**! This one completely blows past the former two and is an amazing experience so far! I honestly really want to do an Octopath 2 playthrough now but again I'm probably going to do Elden Ring DLC and move on from there in a month or so. Besides for annoying random encounters which are still a thing (in contrast to the Star Ocean 2 remake which I played a while ago as well and enjoyed) I love this game. The really unique 2.5D style square's utilized in a lot of their smaller titles, the charming characters with cool designs, and the battle system are all great. I'm at the 2 hr 40m mark right now and have done chapter one of Throne and Temenos (had to look up his name it's hard to remember) and am starting Osvalds. Some of the sidequests I've come across are clearly later game stuff as well but I did manage to finish one of them.\n\nThe weird thing is I own Octopath 1 because I bought it on sale during Epic's winter sale since it was a historical low but I still haven't gotten around to it. I see a lot of people say it's worth just playing 2 first since it's so much better than 1 so I might just do that instead now that 2 is on gamepass. I'm open to feedback regarding that.\n\nI also might fill in the remaining time until Shadow of the Erdtree with **Max Payne 1 (and maybe 2)** or just binge watch some anime instead. They're supposed to be pretty short games and they've sat in my backlog for A LONG time now and I've been doing a great job chewing through it the past year.\n\n**(Going a bit off topic now so you can stop reading here if all you care about is the discussion prompt)**\n\nUnfortunately nothing from this next fest seems to come anywhere close to the smash hit demo last year's summers fest had with Lies of P. That demo was amazing and the final game was such a sleeper hit with how packed last year was as well. The fact that Microsoft got it day 1 on gamepass was amazing too. I ended up playing it a month or so after launch since I was busy with starfield initially and can't sing its praises enough because none of these other jank soulslikes are anywhere close to the quality or polish level that this random Korean studio pulled off. \n\nAnyway demos really are an amazing marketing tool if you have an amazing game to show the world but if you have a mid game they'll very quickly kill off any interest I may have had in the game. I do wish more AAA publishers did them though. It's the one thing I really appreciate Square doing.",
            "**Fallout: New Vegas** As per usual, my character is a homosexual with maxed out charisma. So I'm basically the Liberace or Elton John of the Mojave. I just made it to Freeside, and my first stop is going to be the old Mormon fort to pick up Arcade Gannon as my hot twink bf.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nNew Vegas is one of my all time favorite games, but if I have one complaint, it's the bullshit legionary assassin squads. There is no way that they need to be THAT tanky and do so much damage without any possible way to avoid the confrontation. Usually the game gives you a speech check, a terminal you can hack to turn off turrets, or even just let you avoid a particular confrontation altogether, but it seems like these legion assassins are hard coded to just beeline straight to you no matter what. So I have to burn through all my ammo and hit tab every two seconds to gobble up every stimpack I own. Booo, not fun. I would say this is a homophobic hate crime from the legion, but unfortunately that's one of the few things they're actually kind of chill about.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOh and while I'm bitching, fuck the addiction mechanic. I play vanilla, but I'm thinking about modding it out because fixer is just not ever worth it to me for giving you that awful \"nausea\" de-buff. It makes me not even bother with the chems in game at all. I can't stand the audio-visual sting every thirty seconds.",
            "**A Plague Tale: Innocence**\n\nI was surprised by how much I enjoyed this game. It\u2019s a very linear, narrative-focused game set during the Black Plague in France. There\u2019s some really simplistic gameplay mainly consisting of stealth and shooting guards with your sling. I do really wish combat and stealth was more-fleshed out and interesting. There\u2019s never really a sense that you don\u2019t know what to do and the \u201cpuzzles\u201d are very simplistic. But this a story-focused game and the story, voice acting and immersive setting are all great and made the game absolutely worth playing. The visuals were so striking and the swarms of rats and horrible imagery were just very striking and kept me invested in the game. It also was just the perfect length, just 15 hours. Long enough to tell a memorable story but not too long to the point where the repetitive gameplay would get annoying and bother me. I\u2019m excited for the sequel which I hear is a big improvement.",
            "Started replaying Elden Ring.\n\nI haven't played since release and was undecided if I was gonna go with my NG+ lvl 150 char or start a new one with a different build for the upcomming DLC and holy shit I forgot how much it opens up at one point \ud83d\ude05 most likely gonna level up my new char while I wait for the DLC and run though that with this new char.\nI somehow forgot how much fun it was just roaming around, killing bosses and exploring and now I'm deep into it again \ud83d\ude01\n\nThe DLC hype turned real that's for sure.",
            "Didn't get to play much, won't change for a week, so all I was able to do was take a glance at the demo for **Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn**, a game I was interested in since the reveal.\n\nOverall, my opinion is positive. Combat feels easier than a Soulslike, but there are lots of elements in here, so \"Souls-Lite\" seems like an apt description. The companion has potential to be quite interesting, but the main character's writing throughout the demo was unfortunately very poor. Some people called this \"Flintspoken\", and to me that comes through on the writing front the most, at least based on this demo. \n\nMinutes after being responsible for >!the death of many of her friends!<, she acts like nothing is wrong and gets excited about her cool new powers. Or minutes after challenging the companion to a fight and getting absolutely destroyed, she's like \"fine, I'll let you tag along, but don't think I can kill you any time I want\". The former is a worse offense than the former, but she didn't come across well. \n\nThe world building sets this up to be interesting enough to entertain for its 20-30h run time it probably has, but the initial character writing makes me doubt they will pull it off well. We'll see. \n\nFrom a gameplay perspective though, I'd say it's worth a try.",
            "If it weren't for the fact that it's a 20 year old game I think **Jade Empire** would be fairly good. Unfortunately it (the version on Steam at least) has a lot of technical issues and the combat definitely feels out of date relative to how refined 'third person action' has become since then. With some googlin' you can find fixes or workarounds for most problems but I wasn't able to resolve them completely - notably I ended up with the target select keybinds on my controller triggers but (I think) since they're an 'axis' and it expects a 'button' it only half-worked. For instance I could only navigate the menus with L trigger and I had to very lightly tap it in order for it to only move to the left once rather than 2-3 at a time lol. I was also unable to reliably unlock from a target to enter free move mode. I also think there might be things that don't work correctly on modern processor clocks / higher FPS as I had real trouble with some of the demon enemies and compared to old footage they turned/tracked my character much faster making it difficult to find any opening.\n\n\nGenerally speaking I think the combat just doesn't feel great either. Animations feel a bit long, dodge has no i-frame and dodge and block either share a button or you have to dodge with two stick movements (left left, etc). It's just rough. I also don't think swapping from style to style feels fluid or worthwhile and I spent most of my time just repeating the same light attack combo. Though I do think if you took the same mechanics with a more modern control scheme and gave them the level of polish of a Nier or Tales or God of War it'd probably be pretty cool. Unfortunately as is it hasn't aged well.\n\n\nI liked the characters and world for the most part. Your party is a bit cartoonish but Dawn Star is a sweetheart, Zu's background is interesting and had I spent more time with them I think Whirlwind and Wild Flower both seem like they'd have a story to tell. The side quests have a nice variety of both your typical 'be the good guy or be the bad guy' options as well as lighter fare like matchmaking or performing a bit role in a play. The main story I'm still not sure of - I'm the chosen one and I have to somehow fix the broken flow of dead souls into the afterlife but there seems to be some intrigue brewing around why you actually are in this situation and how it all (perhaps all too conveniently) came to be. It's good enough at least. Ultimately I think if I was having more fun with the combat I'd be pretty happy continuing to play but as is it's the kind of game that makes me think \"This isn't bad but surely I have better games to play too\".",
            "After the new Doom game was announced, I thought it was time to give **Doom Eternal** another shot. I really, *really* didn't like this one back in 2020, compared to Doom 2016 which I had only played a month prior and thought it was absolutely fantastic.\n\nYeah... still don't enjoy it at all. Within an hour of playing I feel swamped with mechanics and buttons to press, constantly dodging around, having to switch weapons AND weapon mods on the fly because almost every enemy has like one weakness and nothing else. And that is by the end of level 2. I dunno, I think Doom 2016 had the perfect cadence, but Eternal is just... way too much. Doesn't feel satisfying at all either. The intro tells you how the demons fear the Doom Slayer, but then right away you're jumping around like a scared chicken because everything is way more dangerous than you are.",
            "**Blasphemous 2**\n\nIt was 50% off or so, but I wasn't sure. Reviews seemed mixed. But looking online someone put it well - if you're a fan of Blasphemous, you might not like the changes. If you just like Metroidvanias in general, you might actually like it more. I liked the first but I'm happy to meet it in both places, so tried it. And I think it's good.\n\nThe main difference is you have 3 weapons, but they made an interesting choice where you pick one to start and find the other two as you journey. Each weapon has a type of environmental interaction (e.g. unga bunga hits bell) to help you solve puzzles, so this means your choice impacts which you can solve first. I didn't realise this for a quite a while, so I'm not sure what impact this has on completing the areas. The game is overall quite linear and will point you to the next boss (which I like), but you start with a choice of three so I assume it changes that.\n\nIt did feel a little too easy. Bosses only took 1 or 2 tries, spikes are minimal damage instead of instant death, and I picked the unga bunga slow heavy hitter and the game was a breeze. But it wasn't easy enough to ruin my enjoyment. Some bosses are a little fast, but I was too lazy to learn the others and I wanted to be stubborn and see if I could just use one. Balance is a little uneven, the enemies with the swords hit very hard, and Everdicto was a massive difficulty spike and an exception to the above. It was tough killing him with the slow weapon, but possible (I am aware of the spinning time stop cheese strat but didn't want to use it). After that, the last boss is essentially a victory lap.\n\nCollectables and backtracking are fine, nowhere near as bad as some games, usually the map will say when you missed a bit, but I did look online for a few things at the end. There are two endings, but you cannot lock yourself out, you just beat the game, your save file is before the last boss, then you go get a few things to unlock the other ending. Some people hate the new cutscene animation style, overall I don't care much about the story (I like the vibes, but ignore most of the words) but it might bother you if you liked that last time.",
            "**Animal Well**\n\nA few weeks ago, I played ZAU on PSN Plus and ended up enjoying the Metroidvania style. I decided to play Animal Well and I\u2019m currently 10 hours into the game. The puzzles and items are really cool and I feel like the game has captivated me a lot. I hope to see a sequel to the game!\n\nDo you have any recommendations for games in this style? For now, the next one will be Guacamelee 2.",
            "I'm still picking away at **Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth**, and while I like it as a *game* more than Remake, I'm still of mixed feelings about the story and tone. It doesn't help that during my last play session a thought popped into my head.\n\n\"This reminds me of a Ubisoft game.\"\n\nUbisoft titles have struggled with jarring tonal issues for a good ten years, particularly when they feature cast of cringe-inducing characters seemingly pulled from a Portland hipster coffee shop. The Remake games have a similar issue. In the original, Wall Market was a seedy slum. In Remake, it's like a flashy tourist district in a college town. The world of FF7 is supposed to a filthy, borderline apocalyptic ecological disaster run by a tyrannical corporation, but so much of the world in Rebirth is...actually really nice, to the extent one sympathizes with Shinra's modernizing project.\n\nThe odd music arrangement doesn't help, either. Here I am climbing a serene mountain path while a party member hints at an uncomfortable past with these very hills, and the accompanying music is...electronic dance music? \n\nThere's just a thorough lack of artistic coherence in these games.",
            "I completed **Still Wakes the Deep**. Took me only 2.4h according to the XBox app. Felt longer, so maybe it didn't register all my play time. I got mixed feelings about this game. On one hand, it has some really cool scenes. On the other hand, a lot of it is crawling through dark industrial environments and slowly \"platforming\" and \"solving puzzles\", aka pressing the only button you can. It's a walking sim, sure, but good walking sims like SOMA and Devotion make every step interesting. Here, it's... not that. I think the game just doesn't have a good emotional/philosophical core. If someone asked me what the story's themes are, I wouldn't know.\n\nI wish it let you spend more time outside the oil rig. That's a really cool-looking setting. However, you seem to spend most of the game inside, and that could be any flooded factory. It's grey and boring. \n\nOverall, it's short enough and the cool stuff's cool enough to warrant a playthrough on Game Pass if you're a fan of movies like The Thing, but damn, this game's 35\u20ac on Steam and I sure wouldn't want to pay that much for a few hours of so-so entertainment. I'd rather watch a horror movie. Speaking of which, for some reason this game wasn't scary at all. I don't mind, because I don't consume horror to be scared, but usually I scare relatively easily and in this case I didn't feel a thing. Strange.",
            "**Lies of P**\n\nSo i finally got around to trying this one, been on my list since release but have felt abit burnt out on Soulslike after binging Elden Ring at release.\n\nI'm currently on chapter 10 and think im closing in on the end, it's a good game overall but there just is something about Souls-copies that aren't made by FromSoft that don't sit right with me.\n\n\nIn this case the feeling of the moment-to-moment gameplay is so close to actual FromSoft that you almost get a Uncanny Valley feeling in a strange way, there is just something missing. I think i'll rather take something that diviates from the formula more than a close copy that just doesn't feel 100% correct like this. \n\n\nOther than that the levels are really easy, i think i've died twice in the levels but the bosses are much harder. I hate second-phases and in Lies of P almost all of them have that mechanic, but they are doable after at most 10 tries so far.\n\nOverall, a good game, but nothing noteworthy and i think i'll forget it soon after finishing.",
            "after spending the beginning of the year playing Rebirth for 100+ hours, i needed a break from long form games. I just wanted to play smaller, more mechanic based games. Had no idea what i was getting myself into.\n\nFirst started playing Balatro. one of the most addicting games i've played and such a genius idea of taking the rules of poker and creating something new and fresh from that foundational knowledge.\n\nThen i picked up Indika. truly one of the most memorable narrative experiences i've ever had in a game. went in completely blind and was so surprised and happy with it. and its such a short game. its not for everyone but the way it utilizes game mechanics and tropes is such a unique delight.\n\nAfter that, i played Doki Doki Literature Club. talk about the complete opposite of anything i've ever played before. decided to give it a try because it was short. played it after getting off work one morning at 7am and stayed up until 11am beating it because i was so hooked by the story. its DEFINITELY not for everyone but it is such a completely unique experience that could only be done in a video game.\n\nA few weeks ago, i started working on a film. there is so much downtime on set that i needed something to play in between scenes. so i started playing Vampire Survivors again. super addicted. and i got 4 of my coworkers to start playing it too so now we're all pushing each other to get new levels and evolutions and we're starting to get into the secret content so its getting really interesing.\n\nNot sure what i want to play next.

            "Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood\n\nI\u2019m around halfway through Stormblood i think, so far this expansion has not blown me away like Heavensward, but there where some incredible highs, i really love how this expansion sedimented the threat the Garleans oppose to the world, in ARR they were basically comically similar to stormtroppers, and the strongest dude we met Gaius, was beaten by the WoL with absolutely zero trouble. This expansion showed how incredibly cruel they are and how much destruction they can wreck on those who stand against them. Zenos is an incredible match to our WoL and i\u2019m stil scratching my head wondering how the hell the characters are going to stand any chance against him, and Yotsuyu is the most evil character i have ever hated in a while.\n\nI also really like how they expanded on the doman culture, Doma feels very fleshed out as a region, and as culturally diverse if not more than Ishigard which was already incredible (but not with a story as rich as the dragonsong war). I love the Doman side characters, like Hien, Gosetsu and the Xaela tribes (Yugiri is part of the crew so she was goated before)\n\nMy one big issue so far has been with the way they are handling the Alah Migo rebellion and Lyse\u2019s role, it feels a little insane how the main character of this expansion (I know WoL is the protagonist, but Lyse is clearly the main pov, like Alphinaud was in HW) has spent the great of majority of it all away from her homeland doing almost nothing of agency, Alah Migo was set up as the main event and now it feels like it has been sidelined, i\u2019m not done with expansion so maybe these feelings will change after I\u2019m done with it and the patches, but it\u2019s a little frustrating.\n\nAlso, maybe this is just an impression, but i think there were more voiced cutscenes in HW, there it was basically one voiced and than one silent, now it feels like to every three silent cutscenes i get one with voice acting, is just a minor thing, and it may just be an impression",
            "**Destiny 2: The Final Shape**\n\nCompleted the campaign and some post-campaign stuff. It's good. I absolutely love the level design with a lot of body horror elements. It's really, really cool. The setting also let the designers create spaces that don't make physical sense but work perfectly in the context. The only issue is that it's incredibly dark at times. And I mean that quite literally. Unfortunately flashlights are a technology that was lost to destiny universe after The Red War campaign so I spent way too long stumbling around dark caves trying to figure out where the fuck I was supposed to go to. The new subclass is fine, I was hoping it would be something completely new rather than just letting you mix and match bits and pieces of previous subclasses but it's fun enough. Titans are still not allowed to do anything non-melee for some reason which is lame. The campaign missions felt easier than TWQ and LF. I'd really love to play the whole story of destiny 1/2 in a singleplayer campaign format because it's just told in a really poor and clunky fashion but the lore itself is really cool and the story is solid. Overall, it's decent, would absolutely not recommend to a new player, would recommend to someone that played destiny 2.",

            "I had some initial resistance to Eternal's gameplay changes, but once you adapt its extremely fun and makes 2016 feel extremely slow. What I didn't like about Eternal was the tone, story and some of the style. I'm still lucky that I love both games.\n\nPeople keep parroting the \"you need to hit the weakness with specific weapon\", but in my experience with Eternal, nothing beats overwhelming firepower. The weakness are just a bonus way to deal with them (except one or two monsters in the dlc).",
            "As someone who adores DOOM Eternal, even I will admit that it does a rather poor job at easing the player in. The game probably didn't need to introduce Cacodemons midway into the first level, let alone Arachnotrons earlier in the second arena fight. I think things get a lot better around the time you get to the third level (Cultist Base), as by that point you have some upgrades and additional weapons that make the game more forgiving and free-form.\n\nTrust me, although spamming the same weapon over and over is not the most practical strategy, you have *a lot* more options during a fight than you make it out to be and you don't need to use every single weapon and ability in the game. Sure, shooting a grenade in a Cacodemon's mouth opens it up for a glory kill, but they die to traditional gunfire just fine and in fact it may be less riskier that way in some situations. If you look at some high-level gameplay online (such as from Zero Master), you'd understand why the demons fear the Doom Slayer.",
            "The weakness thing is definitely an internet thing; besides the cacodemon with their admittedly stupid weakness to sticky bombs enemies all allow for multiple approaches.\n\n\nIt's also quite possible to heavily lean into your favorite weapons, especially on normal difficulty.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "I mostly quit Eternal because I think all the platforming is terrible and too prevalent. I do not go to Doom for first person platforming. And I don\u2019t think the way they\u2019ve included it leans into the fast paced, keep moving and shooting loop the previous game had.",
            "I *damn near* re-bought and installed Doom Eternal after that trailer, lol... thank you for your service, I'll just wait for the new game.",
            "Just install a mod to double or triple your ammo and have a blast.",
            "this has put the game back on my list - big fan of metroidvanias, not too many soulslikes under my belt and not a fan of tedious mechanics. tried the first one but bounced off, wasn't in a mindset to guess and wander nor pick up a guide at the time, but did really like the astethics and gameplay.",
            "Some of the top modern Metroidvanias are:\n\n* Hollow Knight\n* Ori and the Will of the Wisps (Blind Forest is great too, but this sequel is a huge step up)\n* Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown\n\n  \nThere's tons great MVs out there, but I would consider the above as \"required reading\" for the genre. If you're still interested after those, I'd recommend:\n\n* Metroid Dread\n* Metroid Prime 1-3 (legendary games, and also an intro to the rare 3D MV)\n* Islets\n* Astalon: Tears of the Earth\n* Guacamelee 1 and 2 (sounds like you're already on that)\n* Steam World Dig 2\n* Aeterna Noctis (divisive game, but those who love it put it up there with the best)",
            "If you mean Metroidvanias, it's a genre that's done to death - every indie dev seems to want to make one, and I'd be the same.\n\nThe things that broadly matter to people are the combat, the world (including map and puzzles), and the movement skills, and different games fall in different places on each. Some don't have much combat, some don't have much backtracking (or it's obvious where to go), some have boring movement with a double jump and dash and that's about it.\n\nAs far as my favourites (I play on PC, not sure which are on PSN): Guacamelee 1&2 were fun (combat decent, humour might grate, backtracking/exploration obvious), Hollow Knight (some people find the combat and platforming too hard, and backtracking tedious - but it's probably my personal favourite), Blasphemous 1&2 (see my comments I posted below). Ori 1&2 are both good, I enjoyed them as do many, but not my favourites (more platforming over combat, visuals over function - foreground occlusion is a sin for me).\n\nOther games that might get you are Rabi-Rabi (bullet hell combat, good gameplay, don't let your mum see you playing it, could not get over the characters and dialogue), Alwa's Awakening&Legacy (they are a little simplistic and retro, but I played the first when I had a cold and feeling simplistic myself so it was a perfect distraction), The Messenger (fun enough to be worthwhile I think). And Super Metroid is a classic for a reason. The new Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown is meant to be good, but haven't played it.",
            "> The odd music arrangement doesn't help, either. Here I am climbing a serene mountain path while a party member hints at an uncomfortable past with these very hills, and the accompanying music is...electronic dance music?\n\nI had an issue with this scene. The music, without any context, is pretty good. I'd actually consider it a banger. But this moment in the original game was so serene and peaceful. Wandering across the the mountains and deserted mine tracks with the golden sky and gorgeous version of the main theme playing was one of the defining moments of the game for me. It has this melancholy feel and it perfectly encapsulates how you're out in the wild; a place abandoned by Shinra and lost in time. \n\nThey play an amazing updated version of that theme when you leave Costa Del Sol in the new one, but going up the mountain was turned into a \"get hype for the climb!\" moment and... I have mixed feelings.",
            "I think P's combat is better than From's. It's more responsive, different types of defense are useful without feeling mandatory, and there's a good variety in weapon movesets and build options. Still, I never finished the game, because its exploration bores me. I came to the conclusion that classic Souls-like combat just doesn't have enough meat to its bones for me without FromSoft's excellent level design and atmosphere.",
            "I might be misremembering but I think stealth kills were patched 'up' so they were better.",
            "It hasn't been too bad to be honest. I followed a tutorial on youtube that showed you how to survive and get to some of the *fun* stuff on your own. So right now I'm just exploring what the game has to offer, and it's been a blast so far.\u00a0",
            "If you ever get to do so, I would recommend playing alongside Blind's tutorial playthrough. The way he explained the game went a long way in helping me understand what is and isn't important to focus on at the beginning. The game may feel overwhelming at the beginning, but from watching that series I noticed that the amount of \"necessary knowledge\" to enjoy the game is surprisingly small and approachable.",
            "I feel that way with terraria. I never could achieve anything at all",
            "Same here. No chance I will get to NG+. Work took over me spare time this week.",
            "Yeah, I'm trying not to. I found a google doc that's got a mostly spoiler free quest guide, and it's kept me on track with quests without making me feel frustrated by stuff like Fextra. I think only one prompt was missing for a very low stakes quest (Boc). \n\nI got back to the critical path last night after finishing Ranni's line and half of Volcano Manor, and I am overleveled and busted right now with a +9 executioner's blade. Just absolutely chunking fools without even having the optimal setup. Hoping I can easy mode the rest of this in a couple more evenings without feeling that burn.",
            "I did Sellen's quest line with Fextralife because there's no way you would find out the order of doing things and going to the right places in the right time yourself. \n\nIt's my single biggest frustration with FromSoft's games. How on earth am I to happen by chance on all of that...\n\nFextralife was rather clear imo.",
            "Got a link?",
            "I think it\u2019s worth a shot for free. The main story only takes about 6 to 8 hours to finish.",
            "I fully agree! And yes I did the Spider Thread Update thingies. School was a really damn good section. Made me, and few little bits out of main game, wish for a bit more survival horror approach. Then again Tango also made Evil Within so I can see why they uh...didn't go into that direction.",
            "I'm not sure how you proceed from a game over, I didn't run into one myself. I would guess that you could simply load a previous save file from the 'tree' as it calls it. It records a save automatically at the start of each week - I did start some over just to test things or if I accidentally selected the wrong dialogue option (which is annoyingly easy to do if you're skipping conversations you've already seen) so I'd think you could just go back to any prior week or restart the current week and continue from that point.",
            "Yeah, the absence of additional gameplay elements contributed as well - I think if you're into it then there's plenty of character/dialogue/story to carry the game but if you don't connect with them there isn't much to fall back on. Going into it mostly blind I was hoping for more of a cRPG experience but I think it's more of a sandbox/walking simulator RPG hybrid of sorts.",
            "Back in the day I remember arriving at endgame woefully underleveled and having to borrow a friend's save to get past >!Yunalesca!<, but I was also not very good at video games at that point in my life.",
            "Amazing, that's all I needed to hear :)",
            "Thank you! What the doctors thought was the problem was actually not the problem and it was sending a lot more minor, so I\u2019ll probably be recovered sooner rather than later. It\u2019s a relief!\n\nAs for legends, it depends on what you want. If you\u2019re looking for a Pok\u00e9mon game, you might want to stay away from it because it doesn\u2019t function like a regular game at all  (more like an action prequel that just happens to have compatible with the main games). It also focuses on catching more than battling, even though it also has some of the toughest trainer fights in the series. So if that appears to you, I would say that\u2019s a great purchase. It didn\u2019t appeal to me, but I think they still did a pretty good job with it. It\u2019s basically another type of game that has Pok\u00e9mon in the name, but a lot of people liked it because of that.\n\nIf you wanted to continue to go more traditional route, I would go to Scarlet and Violet with the DLC. That game does have a lot of glitches and, but none of it is unplayable because of them. Those two are also open world, but they focus more on battling. So that\u2019s what you want, I would go for that.",
            "I quit the first's demo because I didn't enjoy it, felt a bit clunky and lost like you said. But it was on sale later so I took a chance since people kept saying it was good. I liked it a lot, but the sequel is far easier like I said. The first is quite punishing with some very hard bosses and platforming areas, especially DLC, and it's harder to know where to go. The sequel is a lot easier and as long as you aren't trying to 100% all pickups not that hard to get through. I found a map that had 'chest' locations which was easy enough to go through after I ran out of ideas.\n\nAs an example, you get rosary beads again for passive buffs, but I just ran the extra money and exp ones the whole game and the only time I swapped was that Everdicto fight. That's more the Sekiro/Souls style where the first time, it's impossible, but by the 5th time you're picking up patterns. But there's a cheese strat if you aren't above it like I said. Other fights were either simple patterns or I could out-DPS them.",
            "No Super Metroid, nor a single Castlevania?! I dare say, sir...\n\nAlso, Batman Arkham Asylum",
            "The balance and variety in offensive and defensive decisions is immaculate in Lies of P.",
            "Savefile:\n\nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/169?tab=description\n\nApplication I used to \"overwrite\" my savefile with the above one:\n\nhttps://github.com/BenGrn/EldenRingSaveCopier",
            "Thanks, that sounds fine.  I wasn't paying enough attention to the part about crew confidence and got relieved a few days after when I miscalculated.  No big deal, but the demo didn't have a way to recover and was wondering how punitive it was about fail states.",
            "I'm baffled.  To me a walking simulator  is a game where the player has no agency in the storytelling.  A sandbox feels a bit closer in that you have a lot of systems to play with.  But a sandbox doesn't traditionally change the story.  Sandboxes are similar to toys - some like The Sims are pure toys. Others like GTA the sandbox is separate from the main story and you can engage with it but doesn't change the outcome. \n\nNeither really seem to fit Disco Elysium.  Everything you do is engaging and mutating your story.  You can't stop engaging with the story, that's all you do.",
            "I specified modern MVs in my post, as I think someone newer to the genre would prefer to start out with newer titles then go back to the classics when they're really into it.\n\nBut I'm with you on your recs, especially Super Metroid - definitely one of the GOATs.",
            "It's just how I think about those terms. To me 'walking simulator' broadly applies to any (usually 3D) game that's basically devoid of 'gameplay' outside of walking and talking. It's a literal, mechanical description.\n\nAs for sandbox I usually think of it meaning a game has an ethos of 'make your own fun'/'carve your own path'. It gives you buttons to press and levers to pull and it's up to you to find or create interesting outcomes. In Disco's case I think the levers are its myriad interactables and the dialogue options and particularly how it tempts you with strange impulses or choices unbound by decorum just to see what happens."

First of all thanks to all the mods for the support and approval for this AMA and the great work with the Sub.\n\nHere are the links for the game (15% OFF, a bargain!! ;) )\n\n# [WILLY'S WONDERLAND - STEAM](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2736950/Willys_Wonderland__The_Game/)\n\n# [XBOX](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/willys-wonderland-the-game/9nprgrjjtfkj)\u00a0[SWITCH\u00a0](https://www.nintendo.com/nl-nl/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Willy-s-Wonderland-The-Game-2565587.html)[PLAYSTATION](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005820)\n\nand some info for the AMA:\n\n# # About Mito Games\n\nWe are a small indie game dev studio from Vit\u00f3ria, Brazil and we are completing 8 years of existence now, but we only started to work with entertainment games in the last 3 years. We have a lot of experience with educational games and advergames but now we want to start to develop our community of entertainment games.\n\nWe have some experience with the consoles because one of our clients for Advergames wanted a really cool game, called\u00a0[Wardogs: Red's Return](https://mitogames.com.br/wardogsredsreturn), which was initially designed for mobiles but grew to be a full PC/Console game at the end, ported and published by Qubyte (this will probably come back for the questions too hehe since this initial design had an impact on our possibilities for the original game and later for Willy's..).\n\nThat led us to an unexpected opportunity, as we were working on a DLC for the game Wardogs, we were invited to make a simpler version of the game for the Willy's Wonderland franchise. Of course, there were a lot of limits and constraints that I will discuss during the AMA, but it was a good opportunity for us to be a bit more known since we are just starting in the entertainment area and also a possible occasion to pay tribute to a movie we all had a lot of fun watching.\n\nI hope the fans of the movie, understanding the conditions we had to make the game will appreciate it a bit, and who knows in the future we can make a bigger, original game with all the characters in there too? \\^\\^\n\nI work mainly with clients and team management, but I am changing more into a PR role now that we are migrating to the entertainment realm, so I am learning how to do it and Reddit is an amazing tool to help smaller studios like ours. ([Please consider following us on your favorite social media](https://linktr.ee/mitogames))\n\nWe are currently finishing the port of our first original game\u00a0[4 The Elements](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2081090/4_The_Elements/)\u00a0for the consoles and developing our new game,\u00a0[Tupi, The Legend of Ararib\u00f3\u00eda](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3028370/Tupi__The_Legend_of_Arariboia/), which will also be available for consoles when published ;)\n\nFeel free to ask me anything about the game, other games, the company, the industry, gamification, or serious games!\n\n# # Rules of the Giveaway:\n\nLeave a question in this thread to be entered into the giveaway:\n\nI will be answering questions from 21/06 at 18:00 GMT until 23/06 18:00 GMT.\n\nUp to 10 players will win a key for the game\u00a0[Willy's Wonderland](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2736950/Willys_Wonderland__The_Game/)\u00a0on STEAM (OR ANOTHER PREFERRED PLATFORM)\n\n(One key for every 10 comments the post gets, but a minimum of 5)\n\nATTENTION, THE GIVEAWAY IS ONLY VALID DURING THE AMA!!\n\nWe will send a DM to the winners here on Reddit after the AMA has ended.\n\nLet us know your thoughts and questions in the comment section below.

            "Game development is really hard, how do you do it for so long with so many barriers while keeping your vision and your stamina?",
            "To be totally honest, yes, there were many, but it was not from the IP's constraints.. regarding that it was quite cool actually, we could propose and create new bosses for the game based on the movie but they are not in the actual movie!!! The biggest constrain was a deadline to make a mobile version and the need to use our game Wardogs as a base, but without time to customize a lot, so honestly it is a much more simple version than the original game.. but it was fun to make and I am very happy that many funs of the movie appreciated the effort. Maybe one day we will be able to make an original game for the IP with Nic's image and all.. who knows \\^\\^",
            "Wow, that's a lot.. ermmm Huggy Wuggy after a quick google search \\^\\~",
            "Hahaaha we can say we have his voice from the movie, yeah :P the poor guy has no lines! LOL, but sadly we didn't have his image rights, so we had to make a generic janitor instead.. it was a very very rushy and 0 budget project, so the game is simple, like a fan tribute, but with the official movie name.. hehe maybe one day he will let us use his image for a % of the game and we can make a new original game for the franchise ;D Thanks for the question!",
            "Voice acting? Have you seen the movie? XD",
            "Thanks!!! not really ahahh It was agreed from start it would be an adaptation from our beat them up Wardogs \\^\\^ so we cut that off from the beginning hehehe",
            "We do, but constructive criticism is also a fruit. The audience is the reason we make games. When people are just trashing or hating its easy to just ignore or joke and be ironic. But fair criticism is very important, no matter how harsh it is.",
            "Mostly using Nics image, lol, but we knew from the start it would be an adaptation of wardogs and no image.. Hehehe so not really, we agreed it from the start what we could do with the budget (null) hehehe",
            "It's almost the same as Wardogs, but simpler... 100% honest answer here hehe but Wardogs was based mostly on old school beat them ups like double dragon, final fight and golden axe \\^\\^ with an a added depth to the combo system and some modern RPG and customizing options.. You will see a lot more of the real references in wardogs than in Willy's.",
            "That would be an AWESOME easter egg Btw.. thanks for the suggestion!!",
            "I think it would be nice to have a third person camera more like Diablo or hades and make a nice hack and slash =p",
            "The main references are the classics double dragon. Battletoads and final fight, but with a deeper combo system, and golden axe for the specials system. The original game that we use as base for willys also had some rpg influences, like customization and equipable items that change your style of playing, like classes. But willys is old and plain beat them up.",
            "Thanks for the RP AND thoughtful question.\nThe opportunity came because qubyte had the contact with the producers from the movie and they wanted to make a game.. We had just released wardogs together and the producers loved the gameplay. That was 3 years ago.. And we had to release it for mobiles in 6 months, then porting for the consoles took a long time and we just released now, but the was finished two years ago..\n\nWe were super excited back then, but then time passed, we got a lot better at developing games and could never update willys, so we were a bit chilling until the port and launch, but now I am super happy with the feedback from many fans of the movie who recognize its a simple game, but better than nothing for such a cool movie, and maybe in the future we can make a better and bigger original game for the franchise, using nicks image and the whole soundtrack, both which we didn't have access for time... =)\n\nI hope you have fun with it!",
            "In this case were the time and budget constrains. But in my opinion, working with franchises is a very nice work. It's cool to know the creators of if and more of their vision, share yours, and propose things for that universe.. So I know it comes with constrains, even if there's a huge budget for the project, but its usually to keep the original vision of the creators, and that process in interesting in itself already. Thanks for the question \\^\\^",
            "Thank you very much for the question, and it was sort of casual. We had just ported and published Wardogs with Qubyte, who were talking to the franchise of the game to try and make something.. They showed them our Games Wardogs, and they liked and accepted that we could do a simple adaptation of the game, but we had no funds, everyone has just a % of the project and worked in its own risk. It was a nice opportunity for us to be more known, and although the game is a lot shorter, and in my opinion simpler than the original Wardogs game, it's being A LOT more recognized and seen, which is very important for us at this point..",
            "Do you work in the industry too? Because you just nailed it, lol its all about keeping the vision, the morale and stamina.. and learning, getting better.. I don't know how we can do it.. it's indeed really hard, for many years me and my associate didn't have any salary.. now we are not paying ourselves again because we got 100% of the company again from our first round investors and are investing a lot in our new products, so it's hard as hell again.. but we believe in it, and seeing the people playing and enjoying our games is something hard do explain.. and addictive I think haha. So that's what gives us more strength to keep doing it... Thanks for the question.",
            "haha sorry I looked up the movie and saw Nicholas Cage. I didn't realize he had no lines. Thanks for the reply!",
            "Nothing inspires confidence in a game like the dev himself saying it's a rushed 0 budget project",
            "He was just allowing me to say that we have something of him from the movie!! Lol, but as I answered above we could not use his image :(",
            "I believe the photo was in the newest Five Nights At Freddy's or will be in the sequel.",
            "Thank you so much for answering",
            "You are welcome, and thanks for the opportunity to say, YES, we used all his lines! hahaa it was the first time I could say something like that about the game.. LOL",
            "I'm here to answer all questions with the truth. But it's a nice fan made tribute to the movie. Nothing more than that. I'm glad some fans of the movie appreciated the effort =) I am not gonna lie to you.."

            "That's not surprising, Obsidian never does romance in their games. They've had this stance as far back as New Vegas I think.",
            "I kinda hate that romances have become sort of obligatory to this genre. I really don't need every RPG I play to be full of bad romantic fanfic. If you don't think it needs it, don't force it.",
            "I remember the Parvati quest line from The Outer Worlds if anything having romance done outside of the player character wouldn't be a bad option.",
            "Man I've been excited about this game since it was teased and little by little it's been whittled down to... very cautious optimism mostly because of how anytime it's talked about it goes  \"its not going to be like x, its not going to have y or do z\" \n\nI am fine without these things but why does it feel like the only things they talk about is what it isnt and not what it'll be?",
            "Well unlike some others here that\u2019s definitely a hit against the game for me. Not every game needs romance but I\u2019m more interested in RPG stories that include it personally. \n\nAs someone with a partner I do everything with in real life it helps me feel immersed to have a world where my character can find a semblance of that as well. It also builds on the story for me, heightening the sense of drama and danger. Commander Shepard sacrificing himself to save humanity is triumphant. Him doing it and sacrificing his love of Tali turns the triumph bittersweet. Even if the romance is basic it still is something that I can - for lack of a better term - headcanon my story around to make the big moments feel more personal. \n\nI know that\u2019s not for everyone, but it\u2019s definitely going to put this lower on my list.",
            "Rip... I really like the pillars universe. But more and more i see of avowed im losing interest. \n\nFirst person only(nvm does have third person now!), iffy looking combat, removal of class system, and no romance... \nJust makes me feel like this is gonna be another outer worlds. Interesting idea, but mediocre. \n\nPeople keep banking 100% on obsidians ability for quest design and story telling, but Outer Worlds left me with little faith. Companions were dull, and the plot felt half baked. \n\nNot everyone might be into romances, but they can add so much to the development of a character and the forming of relationships for the world and player within that world.\n\nGuess we shall see",
            "Video game romances are shallow by nature. It always feels super hollow because you can\u2019t really encapsulate that emotion very well through player choice. It ends up being a character acting exactly the same with added fluff dialogue about how they love you. The best video game romances are just like the best romances in any other mediums: a product of good writing. Mostly they seem like an afterthought so I won\u2019t mourn this.\n\nI will go against the grain and say all they had to say was \u201cOuter Worlds but fantasy\u201d because I loved that game and I seem to be the outlier here on that\n\nEdit: should also add it\u2019s often hard to have compelling chemistry when one of the people is a text box, then you\u2019re really relying on the writing.",
            "Oof almost immediately if outer worlds is a good comparison im not hopeful. If skyrim was the depth of a puddle and the scope of an ocean then outer worlds was just a puddle. I really hope it's a bad comparison.",
            "I'm going to go against the grain of this thread and say that no romance is just another hit against this game in a long list of \"This isn't going to be included,\" \"don't expect this,\" etc. \n\nI already think the Pillars universe is bland and boring, and moving it to first person isn't going to get me excited.",
            "I am absolutely in favor of this. I could write a treatise on how much I resent romance in modern gaming. I'll try and trim it down to the primary talking points, happy to discuss in detail with anyone though.\n\n1. I don't like that romance is treated like the reward for talking to/befriending a companion. I spoke to the companion because I liked their character, not because I was wanting Wyll to essentially beg me to fuck them.\n2. I don't like that so many characters in RPGs these days are essentially waiting around for my character to express an interest in them before they'll melt in my hand. I could create a neon green shrek with purple hair that is extremely rude to them and everyone in existence, but if I hit the generally correct dialogue options, anyone and everyone will fall in love with me.\n3. Most importantly, I don't like that the strong emphasis on variety means that each romance is quite dead end. I don't really engage with Stardew Valley romance for this reason. BG3 handled this better than most, but I still think it could have been better.\n\nIf a game wanted to have an interesting romance option with chemistry and strong writing, I would much rather play through that than essentially repeating Kuzco being like, \"no, hate your hair, no, no. Is this the best you could do?\"",
            "The more I hear about Avowed, the less confidence I gave for this title. From the gameplay and combat trailer, it feels kind of underwhelming.",
            "I want to be excited about this game, but I think it's going to be one of those things I pick up much later, if at all. I played the first Pillars of Eternity and the world building felt so checkbox-y. The ending felt lackluster and like the game really should have been 2 or 3 to tell the story and drop the plot reveals. I get the sense that adding a third person perspective was done a bit reactively to initial feedback perhaps, and that it won't be very tuned.\n\nI haven't played the second Pillars as the first put me off enough not to try, but I appreciate the company for being one of the first to bring back the isometric CRPG.",
            "So glad there will be a 3rd person PoV.  I have a tough time with 1st person, I get motion sick pretty easily.  FoV and high frame rate helps, but not always.\n\nAnd who cares about a romance. \n\nAlso, anyone expecting this to be like Skyrim hasn't paid any attention whatsoever.  I'm just excited to get another fame in Eora.",
            "Their explanation of why they didn't include romance actually makes sense to me. I've played quite a few RPGs that have some form of romance option, and only a small minority actually pulled it off in a way that felt (to me) like it meaningfully adds to the game. \n\nIf it was purely an additional *option* with no impact on anything else (like say a graphics setting) that wouldn't be an issue. However, in quite a lot of those games I feel like adding romance possibilities had a notable negative impact on some other aspect, most frequently on the characterization of and variety in potential archetypes and interactions between party characters.",
            "Many of my favorite character interactions in gaming are platonic at best. Wrex-Shepard was awesome. Disco Elysium's cop duo was a fantastically strange beast. FF15's bro trip is ingrained into my neural pathways. I like characters that bounce well off each other.\n\nMy favorite romantic duo in gaming is actually a pair of characters who were already together: Kay and Yu from Haven. They're so dorkishly organic and temper each other so well. They answer the question of \"Now what?\" that comes after a couple has their first kiss, rides off into the sunset, and (tries) to live happily ever after. Their relationship isn't about a honeymoon or some climatic sex scene, it's about how the hurdles of a relationship never actually end. And they're written that way BECAUSE it's not an optional romance. It was written from the ground-up, and it was infinitely better for it.",
            "Good honestly, most romances in gaming are not well written at all to be honest, and I'm getting pretty tired of them. The unabashed horniness of every party member in BG3 is a big reason why I dropped that game.",
            "Off topic but is anyone else happy that every single movie doesn't force romance into it like they used to? A movie like Major League is a example of what they used to do. An awesome movie where the momentum comes to a complete fucking halt during those awful library scenes between Tom Berenger and Rene Russo. Totally unnecessary romance but they used to have to include a love story in every movie.",
            "Is it bad that I think romance mechanics are bit distracting in some games? Oh you married this person? Okay now never do any interactions after that.",
            "Im fine with this. I dont care for romance in games anyway. I get that its always nice to have options, but sometimes it gets really annoying, especially when its tied to other things that can impact your gameplay or story. Romance becoming too common in games is getting as annoying as every game feeling the need to have a crafting system.",
            "That's good imo. They had a really half baked romance system in PoE2 that was a kickstarter stretch goal and it was really awkward lol. It wasn't terrible but it didn't really add anything to the characters so it's nice that they aren't trying to force it for this game too. \n\nHonestly I've always felt like romance in RPGs was very \"checklist-y\" and fake even in games that do it well like BG3. Most of it comes down to saying the right things in conversation to get your relationship score up and it always sort of took me out of the story. It's one of the reasons why I never really finished BG3 honestly.",
            "I can't read the article right now, so I can only assume it is because Obsidian games tend to be awful at it.",
            "I would think being like Skyrim would be a plus, seeing as how there's actually very few games in that playspace. Open world RPGs, sure, but not the first-person, you-can-steal/move-and-kill-pretty-much-anyone kind of game. The kind with enough freedom you can aggro the leaders of every town and kite them to fight them all at once if you wanted to. And Skyrim being as old as it is, while still fairly good, has well worn its welcome, so it'd be nice to get some fresh air in that space. Though I'd worry most folks would either be extremely burnt out from playing too much of it, or find the new game just isn't as \"comfy\" as the thing they've grown used to. Which I understand, but is a bit unfortunate.",
            "I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t disappointed with how the game seems to have shaped up, but at the end of the day Obsidian makes good games, I love action RPGs, I love fantasy, so I\u2019ll still be there at release.\n\nA game doesn\u2019t have to be what I hoped it would be or what scope I hoped a studio might have accomplished in order to be good, and I can adjust my expectations and approach it for what it is. As long as they improved on The Outer Worlds and worked out how to make the game environments engaging and immersive, I\u2019m happy.",
            "I'm fine with no romance. Buy don't go and then make a whole quest chain about romance for a side character like they did with The Outer Worlds. It is essentially the same thing but the player doesn't get the reward. I hated that. Give my character the romance or don't have it at all.",
            "Romances and relationships are the elements of games which I tend to not care about unless they have a direct impact on the gameplay, like stat bonuses or new abilities. I normally don't even bother with companions, or just stick with the first option I'm given. \n\nSo I can definitely live without romances in Avowed",
            "Why is romance always the only way to meaningfully interact with companions? Why not deeper friendships, or more intriguing questlines where the companions have their own aspirations, goals, and agendas which the player can interact with or change the outcome of?\n\nIt feels like the vast majority of RPGs with \"companions\" just have these NPCs that serve no purpose except to help in combat, and show a two minute sex scene if you hit the right dialogue options. BG3 was the worst at this, the companions were basically sex dolls with no personality other than \"relentlessly horny\".",
            "Only times I really felt it worked when playing a game was mass effect and cyberpunk. Otherwise it seems really forced and cringey. Starfield romance was really bad, for example.",
            "Thank god.  The romances from Dragon Age to BG3 are becoming increasingly cringy.  Even the mind flayer wants to jump my bones.",
            "It's a plus for me. Romance in video games are usually really weak in development. It's a side show so it ends up being rushed and childish. Plus romances eventually dominate every fan community and fans of other aspects of a party based RPG end up fleeing because everything is just horny-posting. Fans get real possesive over these fictional characters and who/how they should be romanced. Those type of fans got to be some of the most toxic gamers out there",
            "I never interacted in any romance system in a game. They have no place in RPGs and resources/time spent on them should be used somewhere else. Just pointless, really.",
            "Pillars 2 being the lone exception, I think.",
            "alpha protocal enters the chat",
            "Pillars II had romance.",
            "Fisto would like a word",
            "KotOR II was a bit of an exception, though that was a sequel to a Bioware game.",
            "kotor 2, alpha protocol, tyranny, and pillars 2 had romance iirc",
            "Am I insane or isn\u2019t there romance in outer worlds?",
            "What Fisto and I had was REAL",
            "AhCeaser was definitely flirting with me",
            "Wait I hadn't noticed new Vegas had zero romance options",
            "It's easy market reach, ultimately. Decent enough romance options and you'll get a lot of minority interest in your game. I know a *lot* of people who have played BG3, Mass Effect, Stardew, etc. that normally wouldn't *because* they love the romance element so much. Often women, often lgbtq friends, etc.",
            "I think that's totally fair, although I don't mind well-written romances in games. I do think that if an RPG maker talks about how deep characters are and that you're traveling with them that there should be some effort into the writing to make the relationships believable - friendships, rivalries...there are other types of relationships that aren't romantic and game devs seem to forget this too. Otherwise the companions are pretty much glorified pack mules.",
            "I will say that romance doesn't need to be super well written to be an interesting and immersive possibility for engaging with characters and the game world. I don't need romance in games but I don't think you need to be some kind of super shipper to see it as a cool mechanic in games that feature it.",
            "I like having different kind of relationships with people. Friends, love and a fight.",
            "Romance is the most popular genre of literature, for starters. Well written romance has a vast potential audience.\n\nAny game that features a group of people interacting closely and relying on each other is actually really badly written if it does not include some kind of romantic interactions, unless there's some really powerful contextual or narrative reason for it. Even if it is just one or two people trying to hit on others and getting told no.\n\nEven in places and groups where romance is discouraged and is potentially a bad idea (like in a workplace), people still flirt, fall in love and start dating in secret.\n\nThat said, game writers often flub it.",
            "I don't mind that it's there, I just wish it weren't so easy to accidentally romance someone when that's not your interest. Maybe allow the option at the start of a run to ask if you want romance. If yes, great, if no, then when Gale asks to show you a magic trick, he doesn't also try to molest you because you naively thought the wizard who asked if you wanted to see a magic trick was actually going to show you a magic trick.\n\nIn BG3 in particular, it's very easy to trigger romance options just by not being a dick to your companions. Then you have to reload or harshly reject them because romance paths almost always lack the nuance to gently let someone down.",
            "I agree, at least with the conclusion, but I don't \"hate\" it necessarily. I think it's natural in RPG games where you're heavily focused and getting involved with characters that people would want romance to be a thing. If it's done well, like Witcher 3 or Cyberpunk, rather than something tacked on (like Skyrim) then I see it as a massive plus that sells you further on the characters and makes the game far richer for it, if you decide to go down that path. But if it's tacked on because \"Well we just need to have it\" then yeah, it's not good at all.",
            "I don\u2019t mind it but it\u2019s always awkward when every single character basically propositions you at some point and you have to turn them down or they\u2019re just randomly flirting with you \n\nBut I also get it because you\u2019re trying to create a lot of different narrative experiences for a wide range of players, plus there\u2019s always an intense Stan or two out there who will bombard social media with fan art",
            "It was kinda of weird that most of the characters in Baldurs Gate were just throwing themselves at me with in the first few hours.",
            "Depends on how well it's done and integrated into the story. In bg3 for example, most romances were there just for the sake of horny players. Except for, maybe, Lae'zel.\n\n\nWitcher 3 or Cyberpunk on the other hand were integrated way better and natural (though, the romance mechanics are meh).",
            "People like them, sometimes they play the game for them or consider them as central to the experience. What\u2019s the problem?",
            "It gets specially bad when the options are \"romance this character\" or \"tell them you hate them and that they'll die alone",
            "[deleted]",
            "I get it. But for me personally, romance in these kind of games is a legit selling point and it become much more interested in a game if there is romance :)",
            ">If you don't think it needs it, don't force it.\n\nI agree, but I also don't know why so many people are vocally against romance as if it's not viable. Is attraction and sex with people that you share a ton of intense experiences with in RPGs such a crazy idea? It happens all the damn time IRL.\n\nIt's a huge part of the human experience and for 99.9% of people some of the most emotional moments in their lives.",
            "The West is so starved for actual romance-focused games like the VNs Japan was churning out by the boatload over a decade ago, but everyone is so irony poisoned about \"dating sims\" being trashy that they just end up smuggling toned-down versions of it into games that otherwise don't really need it.",
            "I definitely don't think it needs to be there. But I'm not going to lie and say that I don't think that it adds an interesting element of intrigue to the experience. It's an interesting flip in the experience when you get tipped that this NPC seems to be headed in a direction where they might be flirting with you are have a thing for you. So in between combat, exploration, grinding, leveling, etc, it's surprisingly satisfying to also pursue and take on the challenge of getting a video game character to like you. \n\nBut like I said, it not being an option isn't something that will turn me off to a game.",
            "Part of hte problem, IMO, is that they're treated as subquests for a player fantasy, which makes them shallow waifu/husbando shit that you pick from a buffet of similarly caliber waifus and husbandos.  A romance subplot requires you to actually be invested in the relationship growing and that doesn't work out great when your custom made PC with an arbitrary personality is suposed to have chemistry with an actual fleshed out character.  There's no real drama or will they or won't they when you're controlling one of the invovled parties, so it can come across as creepy pushiness.\n\nMeanwhile, in, say, your bog standard JRPG where you're not given a lot of choice, say ye olde Final Fantasy 7, there's an actual *arc*.  It's not a subquest, it's not possible to resovle it early on, the romantic tension is present through the entire game and it's not necessarily obvious who Cloud's going to gend up with from the get go because you don't get to decide Cloud's entire personality, there's something there to be intrigued by.  The player might be lead to believe Aeris is going to be the main romantic interest, but she (spoilers) dies, and then the rest of hte game Cloud's going to greive and bond with Tifa in a way that makes sense in the plot.  It's not Romeo and Juliet, but it's miles above anything you'd see in \"choices matter\" RPG.  Sure, it's possible through choiuces in the game for Cloud and Tifa to not be implied to get together by the end, but like that takes some dedication to do and it's not really comparable to the dating pool buffet style of romantic subquests you'll see in a game like Dragon Age.\n\nI'm basic as shit, I love a good romantic subplot, I don't even need it to be *great* per se to enjoy it, it can just be cute and I'll cheer it on, but there's no need for it to involve the player character.  If it does involve the player character, the PC kind of needs to be an actual character for it to be satisfying, and that probably means them being intrested in *maybe* one of two people if ther'es a love triangle, and that should ideally be something that has tension all the way until the end credits so that it doesn't stop being a relevant part of the story the moment the PC gifts them a bajillion items or whatever.  Ideally there shouldn't really be any numbers invovled at all and the player character, independent of hte player, should need to ahve their own internal reason to want to actually make a romantic gesture in the first place instead of being an option that if the player chooses too early gets them shot down or whatever.  and also people can actually say geralt's name out loud instead of awkwardly referring to him exclusively by his last name except in written notes.\n\niunno, i want more geralts than name-a-PC's in these kinds of games.  i don't need my RPG's to have blank slate protagonists all the fucking time, it's hard to write them in a way that actually involves them in a story in a way that feels actually intriguing when the writers have to account for the player having a completely arbitrary vision for *their* character.  geralt's flexible, he can go a few ways so that you can make decisions as him, but you're not inveting geralt's backstory in your head and then getting upset when the game instead tells you geralt's a witcher and he's really gruff and has history with all these characters.",
            "Starfield was horrible with this. I thought I had nice platonic friendships with Sam and Sarah and they both came onto me unexpectedly.",
            "The quality of the writing and the implementation of the romance system make or break them. If it's a \"put enough friendship points in and sex comes out\" type deal like BioWare does, I'm not interested.",
            "I\u2019d definitely rather not include them than have them be half-assed, and in a lot of games they\u2019re super half assed",
            "I just hate the insanely low quality of romance that is everywhere in the genre.\n\nIt got to the point where Bioware characters barely arrived in camp before trying to get into bed with you. Baldur's Gate 3 was the same. It's jarring.",
            "I just hate how meaningless they mostly are. A lot of the bond you make seems forced or no more than you'd have with a friendship but with some making out added to the mix and a \"sex\" scene I could mostly do without.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3's were the worst in how everyone just wants to suck your fucking dick the moment you get out the gate. I think having a character or two down for casual sex is fine and realistic, I think having all of them except Shadowheart was way too fucking much, but since one of their whole marketing trailers was fucking a bear I guess I expected too much.\n\nI appreciated that once you \"chose\", as it were, it was never brought up again, but having literally every motherfucker proposition you is ridiculous. Having one of your characters become a meme because of it is great marketing but not good writing.",

Back when The Outer Worlds was announced, everyone was hyping it up as the Fallout killer and when it released...well.

I know Pillars doesn't have the best plot, but the worldbuilding is good, the characters are well written, it has a charm to it.\n\nOuter Worlds just felt like a very cheap B movie that tries to be funny and isn't.\n\nI'm just hoping they simply weren't fit to write for that game's tone, and they didn't actually lose their talent.",

Literally an hour after meeting Karlach she was telling me I was all she could think about, how she wanted to know what I would do to her, and that God-awful cringe line \"I want to ride you until you see stars\" that everybody in the BG fandom unironically thinks is... good? The romance subplots in BG3 are by 15-year-olds, for 15-year-olds.\n\nAnd not only that, outside of Shadowheart and Astarion, most of the companions just had hardly anything to say if you didn't romance them. So much of their character was bound up in the romance subplots. Wyll and Karlach especially barely even *exist* outside of the romance.\n\nStardew Valley's is much more mechanical than romance, and that's by design. It's a nod to Harvest Moon where getting married and having kids is part of the goal of the game.

No, which is why (partially at least) most CRPG games have incredibly good writing but very limited commercial success.\n\nAs for the tone, I could maybe see that in DOS2 but I don't think I ever got \"silly\" as the tone for BG3.

            "Yeah, it feels like Fire Emblem pivoted pretty hard towards that stuff as a series - within a few titles you go from Blazing Blade which is pretty much just a fantasy story with a few slightly exaggerated characters, to the modern entries where basically the entire cast is a huge collection of anime tropes with very quirky personalities.",
            "At least back with Fates, the romances had a purpose in merging skills from different units, but I don't disagree that it's very much hamfisted into most other entries and games",
            "I think people who are trying to min max are a pretty niche audience too though.",
            "Definitely agree with Morrigan, but not so much Shadowheart. I dont think romance specifically elevated her questline.\n\nI did a few playthroughs with and without her romance and iirc the only difference is a few lines of a dialogue, a scene banging next to a statue, and a swimming scene with some more banging.\n\nTake away the romance, and you still have a well written character that you've bonded with as a companion throughout the journey, just without the banging and short dialogue at the end of house of grief.",
            "Degamify? Probably by making it feel more like a continuous thing, rather than a meter you fill up via conversations or whatever the game wants you to do, then forgetting about it. Have the relationship mean something more than something more than 'winning' it. So probably.. making it something you can lose within reason, and doesnt give some immediate cutscene reward, to be forgotten about after.",
            "I very much feel the same about films as well. The forced romance subplot in every film is incredibly tiring. I love romcoms and romance films, I like films with a good romance that is important to the story. I absolutely hated the romance subplot in Spiderman: Homecoming.",

            "I think I talked to Karlach like twice before she came up to me with that \"I want to ride you until you see stars\" line lol. Conversely Astarion fucking hated me and refused romance throughout the entire game despite us having the highest relationship for some reason. The triggers for romance in that game feel really weird or even bugged sometimes honestly.",
            "I thought that was the point. To me she was written with options, one of them being, not reading the room and being codependent on her because she is a capable woman. It's just reality, a lot of men can be either young or juvenile despite being older and lack tact and being competent in their lives because of being spoiled among other factors. \n\nThere also options to be emotionally intelligent and adaptive. Someone who's done a fair amount of healing and knows who they are and what they want. Personally, I really enjoyed her character and I can see what they had going for it.",
            "That's pretty much how it was in Fallout 4 too",
            "I never said that I hated the character, in fact if I did, I would not have bothered with the quest at all. I did it because I wanted her to be happy.\n\nIt doesn't change the fact that I was bitter about it. Regardless if my choices had any consequences doesn't change the fact that they wrote a romance for my companion but not for me. And not only that, they also involved me somehow in a quest about it. I could simply not do the quests, but as I said I cared about the character, so yeah...\n\nThis is like giving your companion a cool weapon/skill while the player has to be content with some lame ass basic stuff.",
            "Well thats great! Thats a plus for sure",
            "I don't do first person games. It doesn't feel fun to me. So it's third person or I pass on the game usually.  The latter isn't a big deal because even with RPGs there are so many to choose from.",

Pentiments writing was on par with Disco Elysium in my opinion as well.\n\n I get it if you don't care for it but saying it's bad is weird to me.",
            "Tyranny? Pentiment? These are well written games too",
            "So, you just dont like their games in general? Also Id argue POE is better written thank NV in a lot of ways.",
            "No, you see, Bethesda Bad, therefore nothing in anything they make now can even have *parts* that are good, duh.",
            "For good or ill, the Elder Scrolls series and Bethesda Fallouts are still the champions of these first-person, open-ended, exploration-based RPGs. Obsidian can scream from the heavens that there game isn't like that, that there game isn't *trying* to be that...but people see similarities regardless, and comparisons will be drawn. Obsidian can't get mad at consumers if the consensus becomes \"meh, Skyrim did this better.\" It doesn't matter that it's over a decade old; if your game is even tangentially in this space, it is *still* competing with Skyrim for consumers' time.",
            "Guess that's why this is such a contentious topic, because in my opinion Pillars is the exact opposite. It delivers the lore (and story) pretty poorly, but once you've overcome what I can only describe as a brick wall of a learning curve to understanding the world, then it hooks you. There's so much they throw at you right out of the gate, so many made up proper nouns and weird, new concepts that I think it drives a lot of folks away. A better told story would've found a way to smooth out that onboarding process.",
            ".... But PoEs storytelling was almost insultingly bad? The world building was the only remotely competent and compelling aspect of the games writing.",
            "I want good games not big sellers. I don't care what happens to Microsoft they can fuck all the way off. Obsidian is doing just fine.",
            "IDK I feel like the only game where the \"wall of text\" criticism is really true is in Pillars 1. That game had a massive issue with the first few hours just being a massive lore dump for sure, although it does get better towards the latter half of the game to be fair. In PoE2 though I never really felt like that was as much of an issue, plus there's more voice acting as well. It's definitely not as high budget as BG3 but I don't necessarily want to hold that against the devs like the original commenter. \n\nAs for the story I guess I never really got invested in the story of BG3 that much so it doesn't hold the same level of interest for me. I liked a lot of the characters and their interactions as well as some of the locations but I felt like the overarching story and the world just wasn't that engaging. I honestly can't even recall a lot of the plot of the game. In pillars I got significantly more invested in the world, like the story hook of these kids being born without souls and the gods with the wheel was way more interesting to me. Pillars 2 also had one of the most interesting settings I've ever seen and I thought the factions in particular were amazing.",
            "BG3 is definitely a much higher budget more accessible game compared to Pillars and Tyranny for sure, but I think calling Obsidian \"Larian-lite\" because of that is really harsh. Also while BG3 is more serious in tone compared to DOS2 I still felt like the overall tone of the game was pretty silly, especially in comparison to like Pillars or something.",
            "> Anyway I think it's quite odd to assume that not having romances would somehow result in more story.\n\nI mean, it kinda does, in a vacuum, if you're only considering counting the number of hours to lines.\n\nIf you don't write something, then that means you have more time to write something else. It's not exclusive to romance. For example, if you have the option to kill a party member, that's a lot of writing that has to be done that you otherwise wouldn't need to bother with. You now have to write two sets: on for players that have this character, and one for the players that don't.",
            ">How is that different from any other branching narrative though.\n\nIt's not. And, when one of those branches ends up feeling hollow, you can say so.",
            "You're taking this strangely personally but I'm going to ignore that chunk.\n\nAstarion is an excellent example of missing out, because he's a great character with a great story, and has some *incredible* moments if you romance him.",
            "They didn't have a time or budget issue with either of the pillars games and pillars 2 ended up flopping, felt like they just spread themselves too thin and lacked direction. Avowed has gone through several leads and I wouldn't be too surprised if it got pushed back from 2024 into 2025. If this game ends up being a rushed mess as well then idk Obsidian is just cooked",
            "Games were a lot cheaper and quicker to make back then, and the console war was burning hot so there was a lot of incentive for Microsoft and Sony to bring their A-game.",
            "We have good games come out frequently just last year, and this year started out really strong too. Sure we aren't getting games from the same franchise as often now, but I think that's fine.",

            "It's not really the kind of thing you see on reddit, but there are other communities where it's evident they are _super_ into the romances of anything in any game.\n\nThat's one reason why Bioware honestly didn't care that much about showing deep mechanical gameplay for Veilguard.  They know their core audience _doesn't want_ complicated, taxing, tactical gameplay.  Their core audience isn't in the reddit bubble - their core audience just wants to check if the combat is serviceable and that every companion is Playersexual.",
            "They 100% pivoted very hard towards that starting with I wanna say Awakening?\n\nAnd it worked because the series was basically on life support prior to Awakening, even though I don't necessarily like some of the direction they've gone in.",
            "To be fair though, the ability for your units to permanently die in combat necessitates a huge cast and a huge cast means if you don't use the quickest and dirtiest tactics to make a character as distinct and notable as possible, they are going to get lost in the horde and nobody will care about them.\n\nHence anime gimmicks.",
            "I was bugged out of the banging scenes despite having her romance as an ending, cruel cruel bug it was.\n\nConversely I had to tell at Gale and Tentacruel to stop causing HR violations every act.",
            ">I dont think romance specifically elevated her questline.\n\nSounds like SOMEONE didn't play as a Selunite cleric!",

            "yeah meanwhile I missed one dialogue option with who I was actually interested in and that let them being unavailable as a romantic option for the rest of the game",
            "BG3 makes the most sense if you're playing a high charisma character that looks like a supermodel. Like, everyone is hitting on David Bowie in fantasy form with his 18+ Charisma? I'm shocked. Shocked!",
            "Prolly cause a lot of them were bugged, assuming you played near release. I'm pretty sure they've somewhat fixed a lot of these issues since then though.",
            "And BG3.\n\nI quit the game because of it lol. There were two characters that I met pretty early in the game, one of them I met briefly, and within an hour or two with her she was pushing hard to fuck me.\n\nI just found it far too goofy and it just put me off the game.",
            "Eh, tyranny was the prologue to a potentially well-written game. \n\nPentiment I haven't touched.\n\nPoE was atrociously bad. It had good worldbuilding but everything else was just.... a big nothing burger. PoE2 did a bit better, gave companions actual personalities and at least had a semblence of a main story with agency. It's narrative just clashed heavily with its gameplay design.",
            "In which ways?\n\nI love deadfire (never fell for poe1) but NV is way tighter written and just better in general. For whatever reason obsidian has leaned way too verbose in both poe games while both tyranny and nv didnt. \n\nDo you have something specific that makes you hold up Deadfire over NV writing?",
            "Saying \"Skyrim did this better\" is totally fair. Saying \"this is bad because it's not trying to be Skyrim\" is not.\n\nI would expect that there will be many things that Avowed does better than Skyrim, but also a bunch that Skyrim does better than Avowed. Just because they're both first person RPGs doesn't mean they're trying to do the same thing. These two are very clearly not trying to do the same thing.",
            "Not every game needs to be the same tone as Pillars, it had a similar tone to Dragon Age Origins and older BG games, having a pure \"grimdark\" tone where there is no real levity is not some hard and fast rule. Obsidian loves CRPGs but don't know how to make them more applicable to a larger audience and now they don't make them anymore. Larian seem to love CRPGs and they made them work and financially viable despite both starting from the same spot (arguably Obsidian far stronger start). It's unfortunate too that Obsidian is either incapable or unwilling to compromise and make their games more commercially viable because now they're just not making them",
            "I've seen a lot of the romance content for Astarion, and one of these days I'm sure I'll try it, but I actually think I *prefer* the \"friend\" route with him. BG3 is a game where I don't think I would say I'm missing out on ANY of the companions' stories if I don't romance them. \n\nSome of the other critiques about video game romances definitely apply to BG3 -- boy howdy, Halsin, you've got to stop coming onto me every time I breathe -- but I don't think the \"character development hidden behind romance path\" thing happened with that one.",
            "Just tell them to stop",
            "If you don\u2019t like the character (the relationship drama is most of her arc) kick her out. I couldn\u2019t stand Felix, so that\u2019s what I ended up doing.",
            "I\u2019m not assuming anything, that\u2019s why I asked them directly to explain what they meant. \n\nIf they don\u2019t feel like answering, I\u2019ll just have to draw my own conclusions on the matter.",
            "Real sore spot, huh?",
            "Yeah it\u2019s that not the fact that it happens completely unprompted by the player at super inappropriate times narratively (like between a conversation leading to a fight and the fight itself all of a sudden my companion is girl crazy and we gotta talk about it before we deal with the people pointing guns at us). Also not related to the god awful one dimensional dialogue.",
            "I could not believe that tentacruel guy. Genuinely every dialouge I had with him was calling him disgusting (I was mad he lied and maybe lashing out) and he still has to call to appear to me shirtless. Like, fuck off man. This is not endearing me to you at all.",
            "I have not. Is it a substantially added experience?",
            "I vibe a lot with the metaphysical stuff. I also enjoy the more serious Tone, NV can get too wacky imo.",
            "This isn't comparing a platformer to a first-person shooter. This is a game that is very much adjacent to Skyrim, regardless of Obsidian's statements to the contrary. If Avowed comes out and it is making the sames mistakes as Skyrim (or worse, making new mistakes) people aren't going to be kind to it. If Obsidian learns the right lessons Skyrim and from their own New Vegas and Outer Worlds, Avowed could be awesome. If Avowed is just Outer Worlds with a Pillars of Eternity coat of paint, Obsidian deserves a little bit of shit in their shoes. \n\nThis idea that people don't judge games based on what they are is a bizarre one - most don't follow the industry closely enough to ever have an idea of what a game is \"trying\" to be, or even that games try to be anything at all. They get a game because it looks fun. If it isn't fun, they probably won't recommend it to friends. For people who *do* follow the industry, they probably looks at previews and reviews. If those don't look positive, they probably won't buy it. As much as I love Obsidian's output, I hate this attitude they seem to have where the masses just don't **get** what they're making, and they seem to despise their projects being described in terms of other properties. Shocker! Your game will be compared to its contemporaries!",
            "I recommend reading your comment back because the second sentence seems to directly contradict the first one.\n\nAnyway, you're free to assume/draw your own conclusions about whatever you want, but if you go into conversations confrontational or try to glean intent with minimal context, all you're going to do is stress yourself out.",
            "More like a spore spot",
            "It definitely wasn't a highlight of the playthrough despite Parvati being my favorite companion.",
            "I haven't done two runs to test it as celibate and as romantic, and you could probably get most of the benefit without the romance, but you wouldn't also get \"Kiss me like you hate me\".",
            "It's significantly more \"enemies to lovers\" than the normal SH romance path. A lot more hostile at the beginning, especially once you reach the temple and start getting a lot of Shar/Selune dialogue popping up. \n\nIt has some great dialogue in it. If you don't want to rock two clerics and are on PC, you can get the mod that adds dieties to Paladins (or change Shart since she's a Sharran by default).",
            "I'm not saying that people don't get it. I'm also not saying that people should praise it if it isn't fun.\n\nI'm saying that there is a lot more to a game than its perspective and narrative genre. DOOM 2016 and Destiny 2 are both first person shooters in a sci-fi setting. It would be a little silly if somebody played DOOM and complained that there were no daily quests because they happened to play another FPS that had them and immediately compared the two.\n\nAvowed doesn't have an open world or the type of exploration that makes Bethesda games what they are. It's never going to have that, nor does it need to have it to be a good game. \n\n> This idea that people don't judge games based on what they are is a bizarre one\n\nYou're missing my point. By all means, judge Avowed for what it is. Maybe it comes out and is just a boring game. Maybe it will be great, who knows? What I'm saying is that when people decide what a game *should* be before they even play it based on an expectation that developers never set (it's first-person and fantasy, so it must be like Skyrim! Destiny is a sci-fi FPS so it must be like DOOM!), they're the ones who are responsible for their own completely unreasonable disappointment. I am expressly saying to judge the game for what it *is*, not what you have decided it ought to be before playing it.",
            "I\u2019m not contradicting myself. I\u2019m keeping an open mind until I hear their explanation; if they\u2019re unwilling to provide one, *then* I\u2019ll start to making assumptions. \n\nI\u2019m more confused as to what you think *you\u2019re* accomplishing here. Let the man speak for himself.",
            "The ship's fridge had to be scrubbed for weeks. WEEKS! I dunno what those engineers do in their spare time but it has forged their intestines out of brass.",
            "I didn\u2019t realize by saying I didn\u2019t like part of what is widely considered one of the most meh games of all time I was inviting judgement from the arbiter of morality.\n\nWhy can\u2019t I dislike bad writing delivered/programmed in an intrusive way that comes up at bad times, without it being political?\n\nWriting interesting multidimensional LGBTQ characters is very doable, obsidian did not do a great job at this in the first place but, their attempts at writing/implementing romantic dialogue make the character feel more one dimensional and kinda stupid. I don\u2019t really care what type of people my media is about i just want them to be done well, like people not caricatures.  \n\nThere are plenty of opportunities for romance in open world(ish) rpg\u2019s. Obsidian did not find those opportunities and instead they have your companion randomly bug you about frequently. In my experience, this mostly happens in small (seemingly unintended) gaps between combat."

Ryan Mccarfy at IGN ran a story about this but pulled it when the dev directly denied it.\n\nSony has not even shown this game at their state of play streams.  Sony isn\u2019t shy when it makes a deal with a game.  They are the only console maker that puts exclusivity periods in their trailers  \n\nIt\u2019s no secret Xbox ports take extra work this gen.

It\u2019s just a matter of a few more clauses being waived. But at this point we don\u2019t have much of an update. Considering how far into the discussion we\u2019ve gotten with Microsoft, we might have made a little more progress in the Xbox discussion versus the Switch. **We\u2019ve also run into an issue with Sony - being able to play cross-platform. That\u2019s another issue that we\u2019d have to take care of as well.** In terms of our conversations regarding the Switch, we\u2019re still in continuous discussion with Nintendo on that one as well.\u201d\n\n> \u201cWe had discussions with Andrew House before, but with the transition to a new president I\u2019m afraid we have not properly met them yet, had proper introductions, or sat down for a discussion,\u201d Yoshida said. (Sony\u2019s new president, Kenichiro Yoshida, started in April.)\n\n> **\u201cSo unfortunately we don\u2019t have any visibility on the current stance Sony is taking. We\u2019re hoping that with the transition there may be some kind of shift but we have not had the opportunity to sit down and discuss.\u201d**\n\nAnyone who has dealt with Sony on cross-play in the industry know they have, by far, the most restrictive policies historically speaking when it comes to other consoles. Especially many years ago, Sony and Microsoft cross-play was nearly impossible due to Sony policies. Even games with massive leverage such as Minecraft and Fortnite had issues negotiating cross-play agreements with Sony. (Multiple games I have worked on have had cross-play internally but did not ship with them turned on due to Sony policies and negotiation failures.) These are finally relaxing, but it likely would have been a major issue for an MMO where cross-play would basically be required to offer a proper experience.\n\nSo this is likely a case where it was technically true that it was not an exclusivity agreement but that Sony policies and the existing agreement were standing in the way of rolling out allowing Xbox players to play on the platform with Sony players.\n\nEdit: Lotta folks out here in r/Games seem to think being a fan of Sony products means you have to believe that they are super easy to work with and never have any policies that are a pain in the ass. Unfortunately, that's not really true. And Sony can be a gigantic pain to work with at times. Especially around these types of policies. Even Nintendo is easier to work with about cross-play, which is quite the feat.",

The graphics could be subpar (if you could calm the artists down enough), with a mediocre frame rate; but the basic gameplay and features need to work and the game can't just crash all the time. During game dev this is the spec that we spend way more attention than others (even if only say 5% of target audience would have such crappy machines), and there are also a lot of testy exchanges between the business folks (who care about addressable markets) and software engineers/artists who care about certain bars of qualities and minimizing work needed to support such low specs. We would obviously spend time on the higher specs as well to do the fancy stuff, but they are more a nice-to-have than a \"must do\" kind of thing. It's overall difficult to build a truly scalable architecture and something's got to give (yes, you can turn the resolution and frame rate up and down, but there are other things like number of enemies on screen that you *can't* tune per machine).\n\nAs an example, one of the games I worked on turned out to be quite controversial. We had a whole patch 80% done to address it by making the game more flexible and with more scale, but it got shot down in the end because it wouldn't work on min spec and they were concerned it would be false marketing (I'm still bitter lol).\n\nI have never worked on console games for long, but it's basically the same.
