        "content": "I've been applying to entry level software engineering jobs since I graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science last year in May. In over a year, I have applied to over 1,100 jobs and gotten no interviews. Not a single one. I started working as an after school teacher / tutor after not being able to get a software engineering job a few months after graduating. It doesn't pay very much though, I'm on the brink of homelessness and I can't find anything better.\n\nAs dumb as it sounds I've known I wanted to be a programmer since I started coding as a kid and found that I genuinely love it. The promise from adults of getting a good programming job if I just work hard has literally been the only thing keeping me going throughout my life up until now. Lot's of schoolwork? It's okay, I'll get a good paying job where I'll just get to program all day if I work through it. Depressed? It's okay, I'll be comfortable enough to figure things out once I'm living on my own with that job if I just push through and earn it. Struggling financially? It's okay, you'll have enough money to live comfortably if you just keep working and get a software engineering job.\n\nSo I did everything with my life that I thought was right just to get a software engineering job: I did good in school and did extracurricular activities that looked good on my resume, got into a good university and into a major that I was told would lead to a high demand and high paying job, kept up my good grades consistently throughout college, worked a job that gave me industry relevant experience while still doing to school, did more resume friendly extracurricular activities, ended up doing my senior project for NASA, and all the while I coded in my free time just because I genuinely love programming.\n\nNow I'm having to skip meals just to pay rent. I thought it was something to do with my resume, but I managed to borrow $200 from someone so I could have my resume professionally redone by someone at TopResume a few months ago but my results haven't changed at all. [Here's a link to an anonymized version of my resume.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S6qHEaKrj0s5jPDVFI1cvdUhE0bbjuH6/view?usp=sharing)\n\nPeople keep saying to just keep trying so I've just kept on doing that since there's literally nothing else to do, but it's not even slightly working. Something big needs to change with what I'm doing. I'm angry and depressed, I have nothing to live for anymore. What the fuck do I need to do to get a software engineering job or even just a single fucking interview?",

            "Keep the resume to one page. Get rid of the coloring and use a better template.\n\nIdk what TopResume is, but most normal resume advice from \"professional resume writers\" is not optimized for SWE roles.\n\nE.g., most 2024 SWE resumes don't have the summary section - it's a waste of space. And if they do have a summary, it's usually pretty short, instead of meandering paragraphs.\n\nIf I'm a recruiter, my hope is that you'd at a minimum be \"analytical\" and \"technically astute\", and given that you are applying for a SWE role, I would assume that you think you're \"skilled at designing, debugging, demonstrating, drawing, deploying, dreaming, drinking dynamic software\" or whatever.\n\nIt doesn't need to be specified, especially not with some alliterative line reminiscent of a Dr. Seuss novel.\n\nThis is why I hate resume services like this, because they take money from people, often when they are at a particularly vulnerable position, and generate absolutely nothing of value.\n\nRead this and follow the advice: [https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/resume/](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/resume/)\n\nHere are some templates you can use: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e8narz/official\\_excellent\\_and\\_exemplary\\_resume\\_sharing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e8narz/official_excellent_and_exemplary_resume_sharing/)\n\nUse bullet points, not paragraphs.\n\nDo not under any circumstances use the \"Experienced \\_\\_\\_\\_ with demonstrated history of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" template that every \"resume writing professional\" thinks is god's gift to mankind.\n\nIf you haven't already: start grinding Leetcode, LLD, and HLD. Getting the interview is only part of the battle: acing it is another thing entirely.\n\nYou will get through this. Trust. Fix your resume, start applying again, and something will click. All it takes is one yes.\n\nYou've made it this far, you will make it farther.\n\nI don't have time this weekend, but if you're not able to make much progress on this, I will rework your resume for you into a standard template next week if you'd like, for free.\n\nUnemployment sucks. I have 3 YOE and have only managed to get a single interview so far, after over hundreds of applications. Believe me when I tell you that I know it fucking sucks.\n\nBut keep your head up, and just keep going.\n\nAnd if you can figure out an anonymous way for me to like, order you some food or something, I'd be happy to do that so you can eat for a day or two. Main thing is I don't want to just give out my payment info to people online, so it'd have to be some way for me to get you food that would require absolutely no information sharing from my end. Not sure if that exists.",
            "Here's what I'd say about your resume as someone who reads a million of them:\n\n* Cut the generic intro paragraph. Everyone's got one, anyone who reads resumes ignores them. If you're going to have some free text, make it something that expresses a little personality.\n\n* Contrary to other advice I actually like the spacing and slight color differences. It's much easier on the eyes than most resumes I've read, although I'd want to feed it through some sort of OCR parser to see if it's pulling the text out correctly. That's a risk when you do a nicely formatted resume - most people looking at them are looking at them as parsed text in some sort of internal system or ATS.\n\n* Your resume in general feels very generic and scatter-shot, like you're trying to say you're good at everything. It's *conceivable* that robotics, compiler design, cybersecurity, and game design are all areas of expertise, but I wouldn't bet on it when I read an anonymous resume. It's natural to try to appeal to a wider range when you're desperate, but remember that your goal isn't to be *okay* to *everyone*, it's to be *exciting* to *someone*.\n\nAll that being said, this is all kinda marginal stuff, and what works with one recruiter might not work with another. I work in the startup world, where buzzwords, certifications, and \"resume language\" are anti-signals, but that wouldn't necessarily be true for someone working in a more traditional corporate environment.\n\nBut at the moment, **it sounds like you could use some advice that isn't directly about your job hunting.**\n\n-----\n\nSo, OP: breaking into engineering has always been hard, and you are unlucky enough to be trying to do it in the worst environment for engineers since the dot-com bubble burst around the turn of the millennium. 1,000 applications for a junior dev wasn't particularly unusual *before* the current market, and it is surely much worse now, so as *incredibly demoralizing* as it probably sounds this is well within the results you could see even if you did everything right and just got a little unlucky.\n\n> So I did everything with my life that I thought was right just to get a software engineering job\n\nOne of the hard things about professional life - or adult life in general - is that there is rarely a \"do X, get Y\" path laid out. And I think part of your distress is coming from having come into your job search with the idea that that was how it would work. Sometimes you do everything right and get screwed, sometimes you do everything wrong and get lucky. A job hunt is not an RPG quest where you collect 1000 Application Tokens and can choose between Boots of PTO or a Greater Chestguard of Seniority, and there's a lot of crappy luck involved you have zero control over. That's crappy game design and it's horribly unfun and it is also the reality of the situation.\n\nIt's an odd coincidence that your exact path - \"I graduated, fell flat on my face, and now I'm tutoring to make ends meet and about to be homeless\" - is word for word the *exact* situation I spent several years in in my 20s. I felt the same way you do right now. That frantic, panicky desperation is a killer. It doesn't even give you the kind of direction that panic normally does, because there's nothing you feel like you can *do* about it.\n\nAnd I can't exactly offer the most optimistic short-term outlook. I actually *did* end up homeless (in the \"had to go sleep in a friend's spare room indefinitely\" sense, although I was hours away from living in a tent). I thought I was dead.\n\nBut here's the thing, OP: the skills you've developed, the knowledge you have, the ways you've improved yourself: those things don't go away. Right now, there is only one thing standing between you and what you want. It's a big, frustrating, scary, difficult thing over which you have very imperfect control. But for all that things feel hopeless right now, **you only have to win *once*. You only need one thing to go right.** And then you'll never be looking for your first job ever again.\n\nI got my first job, as it happens, through someone I knew right here on Reddit. They sent me a DM on the very worst day of my life. At the moment my life hit its absolute nadir, at the moment I felt the most hopeless, like the most abject, worthless, pathetic failure who would never be anything but a waste of potential, that was the *exact moment* they were messaging me. And I went from \"where I am going to pitch my tent\" to running a team at that job in less than six months. Today, less than six years later, I'm the founder of my own company, one that might or might not succeed but that is a player at least worth taking seriously. Because I only had to win once. And then all the things I'd spent time building about myself could begin to pay off.\n\nAs hopeless and bleak as the future looks right now, it *can* turn around, and it can do so in completely random ways. It isn't forever, and you can get to a point in your life where you look back almost fondly at those moments, with a feeling of \"wow, I just could never have guessed it would turn out this way\". I know that's hard, if not impossible, to feel from where you are right now. But it is the truth.\n\n-----\n\nNow, in terms of concrete stuff:\n\n* My team interviews people. I don't know if I can find you a job. But if you're really good, we can vouch for that, and I bet I can get someone to talk to you. I've been wanting for a while to try to find a bunch of hidden skilled people the market is missing and write a blog post about it, so this isn't even altruism on my part. If you want to try, [give this problem a shot](https://www.otherbranch.com/practice-coding-problem), and let me know how you do on it. (Or lie, if you want. But the last thing I'd want to do to you in your current state is bring you into an interview you're unprepared for, so think of the practice as a way to avoid that outcome.)\n\n* Do you like pasta? I like pasta. I've got money to spare, and I would like to send you a hundred pounds of it. How might I go about doing that?\n\n* If you ever need someone to talk to, someone who has been in the almost exact godawful place that you are right now and come out the other side with the wisdom and experience that you earn by going through hell, let me know. I'll be happy to talk as much as you want, within reason, and to share my expertise as far as it goes.",
            "I'll be blunt, your resume sucks. \n\n1. I have 10+ YoE as a staff SE, team lead and manager (I am currently a hiring manager, BTW). Your resume is twice as long as mine.\n\n2. That paragraph at the top is hilarious but get rid of it. This sounds like what I'd expect ChatGPT to respond to the prompt \"Write a resume summary paragraph for a software engineer with as many buzzwords as possible, but with no actual content.\" FWIW, I did just that and it sounds almost exactly like what you have there...\n\n3. Areas of expertise. \"Software Engineering?\", well I guess I should hope so. But, you just graduated, you don't have any areas of expertise. I'd either get rid of this entirely, or change it to \"Areas of interest\" and be specific. Even if you're just lying and put whatever it is the company you're applying at does. If you want to keep it, at least move it down.\n\n4. Technical Proficiencies. Whatever, it's pretty much the same basic shit that's on everyone's resume. Just keep in mind that once you fix your resume and start getting interviews, if you have it on there you might end up having to show that you actually have proficiency in it. \n\n5. Career experience. Now we're getting somewhere. The first one (Coding and STEM Coach) is actually fine. The second one (Optimization Engineer) sounds like bullshit. Was this an actual job or an undergrad research project? I doubt this was an actual job title. Again there's a lot of words here that say virtually nothing about what you did. \"Utilized deep\nknowledge of algorithms to review individual codes and understand component-wise functionality\"... come on. That's just saying you looked at the code. And don't ever call it \"codes.\" That bullet point at the end is a good one but probably should just be a sentence in the paragraph after getting rid of all the bullshit. Here's what I'd put:\n\n>Performed extensive research on experimental grammar-based fuzzing tool.  Reduced tools\u2019 runtime by 10%-40% by eliminating irrelevant code and replacing O(N2) algorithm with O(N) algorithm. Prepared reports on research and test results.\n\nAlso don't put 2022-2022. If it's less than a couple years put the months on it. This is just basic resume protocol, I can't believe someone charging $200 would do that. \n\n5. Education section is fine. If that thing above is an undergrad research project you might want to put it here instead or in Projects.\n\n6. Projects. Some of these sound like they might be interesting if there was any information here about what you actually did. \nAnd... \"Joined voice channels at flexible times and play random sound files uploadable to the bot.\" Again I can't believe someone would charge $200 for a resume and not maintain verb tense within a single sentence. \n\n7. Certs/awards: This is fine.\n\nThen there's the order of how this stuff should appear. Get rid of the summary paragraph and Areas of Expertise. Then Career Experience, Projects, Technical Proficiencies, Awards, Certifications, Education. \n\nAnd no more than one page. \n\nBest of luck.\n\nedit: I've thought about it a bit more, and aside from all these nits, the overarching problem is that when I read the resume, I get the impression that you're trying to bullshit me. Job #1 for a hiring manager is to be able to detect that - it's the worst possible thing you can do.",

            "Be specific in linking the technologies you are proficient in to actual examples. You have more languages listed here than resumes I see for Senior devs, I guarantee you\u2019re not proficient in C, C++, Python, Java, Rust, JavaScript, PHP, and C# in any meaningful way. That, combined with the other language you use comes off as arrogant.\u00a0\n\nFor example what did you actual do in your Optimization Engineer role, what language, how is it deployed, what metrics and tools to you use to measure this 40% efficiency increase?",
            "Hey bro! Sorry to hear but there's something else: Your resume doesn't work (An elegant way to say it sucks).\n\nPlease, take a look at r/resumes at reddit so you can know how you have to improve your resume and edit it accordingly:\n\n1. The order of view is wrong. Professional path first, projects second, soft/hard skills third and then University info.\n\n2. Add more useful data: How much impact have you created with your students? Is it measurable? What data analysis tool did you use to measure it? Did you improve it by 80%? 60%? 1k students?\n\n3. NASA: I would place that at the top of the projects/professional path. Include as much data and measures you could from that project. If possible, a reference at LinkedIn would work.\n\n4. Projects: Add a GitHub link to any of them (if possible).\n\n5. Portfolio : place it at the top of your resume. Don't spend too much on who you are, just share a single link to LinkedIn so they can figure it out.\n\n7. Most important: ONE SINGLE PAGE! Unless you have spent more than 20 years in the industry it is valid, otherwise use just one sheet of paper for your resume.\n\nHope it helps you to improve your chances to get a job. Cheers!",

Do not miss this opportunity.\n\n2 - **For each experience**, list 2-3 bullet points to highlight the best skills you utilized in that work experience. Ensure that your resume reflects the skills sought by recruiters. From your current resume, if a recruiter is seeking a robotic engineer, your experience and projects do not list the skills they are looking for.\n\n3 - **Select 2-3 projects** that best showcase your skills. Tailor these projects to match the job description, modifying them for each resume to align with the specific company. For instance, if you're applying for a robotic job, highlight projects demonstrating skills in robotics (Python, C). If you're applying for a web developer position, showcase projects using web development skills (React, JavaScript, SEO). Ensure that the projects you list satisfy the skills sought by recruiters; otherwise, they may overlook them.\n\n4 - Use action verbs to demonstrate your achievements, not just your responsibilities.\n\nBelow is an example of how I used ChatGPT to improve your resume. I included some skills in the experience and projects as examples for you to customize your resume. It's important to note that you should not fabricate skills for projects you did not work on (for example, machine learning if you did not use it). Hiring managers will likely ask you to talk about those projects, so it's best to be honest.

You can also volunteer,  it\u2019s campaign season,  your local politicians need developers for simple things.   Apps,  app testing for the websites,  anything computers.   On your resume - volunteered for.  Politicians where I wrote software for blah.  \n\nOr you can consider the military - they have computer jobs.  You need computer job experience.  Be honest with the military recruiters on what you want and they may have opportunities to teach you.  You need real life job experience.  \n\nInternship is the best but if you\u2019re out of college that\u2019s very difficult.  You could try going back to college to get your masters degree but it doesn\u2019t sound like you have the money for that. \n\nYour resume is heavily padded and anyone can see through it.   You have no real world experience and you\u2019re listing several languages as advanced skills.   And then your experience is 1 line tech demos. \n\nResume not matching skills is a huge red flag as a hiring manager.  It\u2019s a waste of time to interview someone who says they are advanced in 10 languages and it turns out they can\u2019t code in any. \n\nI would focus on getting actual experiences and don\u2019t just write - I made a demo.   Write what you did specifically.   Too many demos.   I contribute to x open source project where I did y. Link to contributions at the bottom.

Very very small companies or startups. \n\nYour resume reads like someone who thinks they have experience and advanced skills but your experience says otherwise.   If you have the skills to back that claim up you\u2019re not showing it.

PICK A TENSE.\n\nPlease make your bullet points measurable.\n\nYou put:  \n  \nCreated comprehensive Python curriculum, including lesson plans and homework for \\*Private Middle School\\*; tutored students, scripted experimental code for students, and encouraged active participation.\n\nAfter:\n\nCreated  a comprehensive Python curriculum for XX amount of students, with a passing rate of XX%. \n\n  \nYou did the measurable thing for optimization engineer which is is good. But seriously the professional fluff isn't needed.\n\n  \n\"Performed **extensive** research on experimental grammar-based fuzzing tool developed by a former PhD student. **Utilized deep knowledge** of algorithms to review individual codes and understand component-wise functionality; **added comments and optimizations** to facilitate future readability. Enhanced tool\u2019s efficiency by rewriting code and building program-specific grammar to improve fuzzing input. **Prepared reports on research** and test results.\"\n\nOn top of sounds pretentious the core of what I got out of this blurb was you wrote comments did some refactoring, and then made your final paper. Honestly the single bullet point does more to tell the person what you did than the blurb.\n\n\"Reduced tools\u2019 runtime by 10%-40% by eliminating irrelevant code and replacing O(N2) algorithm with O(N) algorithm.\"\n\n\\^\\^This is good\\^\\^\n\n  \nEducation fine move it to the very bottom\n\nProject Highlights, keep two, drop the rest. Seriously you have work exp already, unless they're open source or your actual projects you're leading and plan to deploy no one cares. Projects == student. You want to look like a professional already.\n\nAlso all your projects show a wide range of talents, but hiring people want to cut through the noise. If the job has NOTHING TO DO with gaming or Ai, why have it? \n\nFrom boot.dev:  \n\"Your #1 job as a job-seeker is to provide\u00a0*signal*\u00a0to potential employers. Signal is the opposite of noise. Noise is all the stuff that doesn't matter. Signal is the stuff that does.\n\nRecruiters, HR reps, hiring managers, and future teammates are all looking for signal.

            "Who are the recruiters trying to find? Someone who can do the tasks done (1) within a specific field (2) with usually a specific framework (3). In my view, ideally, your resume should highlight all 3 points. The more experienced you are the easier to have all these points checked.\n\nWhat i see in your resume that you have no idea what you are dealing with. Speaking frankly, you don't know what you want to do here and what job you are applying for. Maybe it's just resume, maybe you actually have no idea yourself.\n\nAdvice:\n\n1) Figure out what you want to do. Frontend, backend, mobile, game dev, networks, security and so on. Choose one or two if it is related but it will be harder.\n\n2) Look at what technologies companies seek for this role and learn them. You seem like to know a lot so maybe it will be partly solved already. Like, for frontend you have to know html, css, js, some framework (react, angular or vue), webpack, etc. For backend you have to know databases (SQL, NOSQL), http with rest, some framework (asp net, spring, flask, etc.), message brokers (kafka and similar), etc.\n\n3) With whatever you chose to learn, practice a lot. However don't think that projects will mean anything in your resume but there is no point if you don't practice.\n\n4) Now tailor your resume for this specific role you chose. No fuzzy words, no abstract summary. No irrelevant for this role technologies. No irrelevant projects and maybe no pet projects at all, give them GitHub, if they're interested, they will go there. Any irrelevant information instantly shows to the recruiter that you don't know what you are dealing with and would question your knowledge straight away.\n\n5) Make sure that all important for this role technologies are present in the resume otherwise you will not appear in searches and when recruiters look at your resume, they would not see essential words and discard it. I mean these things that you have learned in the point 2. Like if it's asp net, then c#, kafka, microservices, postgres/mongo, aws/azure are better to be presented in your resume.\n\n6) Either delete irrelevant experience or make it short. I don't honestly know about this, maybe better leave it as is.\n\nJust try to improve and don't lose hope. But if you don't improve and don't change anything, basically if your resume doesn't get stronger with time, don't expect any good results. Good luck.",

I guess the \"professional\" who wrote it thinks throwing in every buzzword gets you past the algorithm. It hasn't worked, so just one clear sentence that actually describes you and your goal is better. \n\nAfter that, I'd do two things: Focus the resume so anyone reading it says, wow, this person lives and breathes for <thing you want to do>. If you want to make 2 or 3 different resumes for 2 or 3 possible career goals, fine. But each should really hyperfocus on something.\n\nThen, network. Check out 100Devs; they have a course that focuses at least as much on networking as coding. They have videos on how to do it if the idea makes you nervous. Most of the people I hear about who are getting jobs are not getting them through clicking Apply. If you do apply, include a really interesting cover letter.

Hard skills \n2. Tech stack  \n3. Soft skills\n\nThe main area was filled with the projects that I've done, and with the short description of them. \nI've added whatever technology I met in the tech stack.

            "Unironically this is basically how to answer this question. The goal is to give a ballpark, not an exact number so nobody wastes their time.\n\nIf you're normal and this is your only job lead, or you have low/average leverage:\n\n* \"According to salary surveys I see the range for similar positions in the market is $xx,000 to $xxx,000 per year and from what I can see on your salary band it's $xx,000 to $xxx,000 for this level. While I lack specifics I'd be comfortable with something in that ballpark, is that consistent with what you have budgeted for this position?\"\n\nOr, if you are on the high side of the range and you have leverage (other offers or the ability to get them quickly):\n\n* \"I currently have interviews with others employers and while I don't have a specific number at this time, I'm looking for something in the ballpark of $xxx,000-$xxx,000 TC.\"\n* \"I'm currently quite happy with my current employer's compensation structure. I don't have specifics but I'm looking for a range of $xxx,000 to $xxx,000\" (make it 5%-20% or so higher than you actually expect them to go, but not so high it's oft putting.)\n* If you know you're at at the high end and will max or exceed any salary band and are okay with $xxx,000 or $x,xxx,000 number. Just name your price with no range, but expect them to come back with that or say 'no thanks.' Really this category applies where you have way too many offers and need to quickly filter them. Be prepared to sell yourself in the interview as to why you are a luxury good worth the premium (e.g. You have a Ph.D. in AI from x university with these published papers and can do this for them, which nobody else can. Here's what I can do and what you get out of the deal.) At this point you might be better suited as a consultant.\n\nThe pitfalls:\n\n* Don't throw out a high number if you have no real ability to get that number otherwise you could be pricing yourself out of the market.\n   * For example If you live in Phoenix it doesn't matter what salaries are in the Bay Area if you aren't actually willing to move to the Bay Area and have no interviews lined up.\n   * It doesn't matter what FAANG is paying if you know you can't pass a FAANG interview loop or if they are currently doing layoffs.\n* Don't give a number first if you don't have to. Ask what the range is for the position, and if they don't provide one give them a range based on publicly available data\n* Don't discuss specifics, give them only a TC (Total Compensation). You don't want to lock in signing bonus, RSUs, regular bonus, benefits, etc. at this time. You don't have specific numbers and the numbers are estimates only. That being said make sure you're not majorly outside the range.\n* Be careful about the low end of the range. Do not throw out any number you would not accept. If you're not sure, just say so and refer to the public data range.\n* Do not mention your current or prior compensation unless it is high, and if it is make sure you're  actually okay with turning down the job that doesn't exceed it.\n\nSee also: These videos.

I can only schedule so many interviews in a week, especially while holding down a full time job. Scheduling anything without knowing for a fact they can afford me is not only a waste of my time, but it can screw up the timing of interviews with other companies that *can* afford me.\n\nSure it's a discussion, but a company that's that far misaligned with me is not going to be able to get close to what I want with bonuses/benefits/TC.

            "It's not the fact that you use math or not, it's just that people who are good at math tend to be good at coding, it requires the same brain structure or something (I'm decent at math, but I never liked it). Sorta similar with music, people who are good at music tend to be good at programming for some reason (not the other way around, as my lack of musical ability can attest).",
            "I use math almost daily and quite extensively in my development.. I am a backend engineer.... our microservices rely heavily on accurate calculations.",
            "> Were you told this was the reason? I got a case of carpal tunnel (not sure if it's similar or not), but my neurologist was super convinced that it's not from the computer, or even from biking, but from sleep habits.\n> \n> \n\nWas it from sleep habits?  That seems like a bit of a leap, but maybe it's a common thing?",
            "This. You could use some voice dictation software to help with hands issues. There are other software options on the market as well for people who are unable to type. Employers can give you more time and can pay for these things as part of ADA accommodations. \n\nI also have dry eyes, but it sounds like to a much lesser extent. It sounds like you are taking some medications that might be helping, but have you ever spoken to your doctor about the implants you can get in your lower ducts to help keep the eyes more moist? I don't know if that is an option for you, but at a period when my dry eyes were hurting badly and the nightly eye gel was not helping me at all, I was researching into that as an option. Perhaps it is something you could ask your doctor about? \n\nIf not, employers will also be required to accommodate you in ways to help you, with anything that is considered a disability by law. If you get chronic headaches or vision problems from looking at the screen for too long you can take breaks or maybe work part time if needed. \n\nConsider also that even if you didn't choose CS, a lot of other jobs are also on a screen/computer, although of course not all are. But you have to ultimately decide if you think you could make it work. \n\nI have disabilities (not similar to yours) and I have been able to get them accommodated for the most part and remain employed as a dev.",
            "Even I have the same problem and I realised screens with good quality display help tremendously and mostly mine is triggered due to the higher amount of pollution and dust where I live.",
            "And set an alarm for every 20 minutes to look 20 seconds at an object 20ft away. The 20:20:20 rule.\n\nIt dramatically reduces eye strain."
