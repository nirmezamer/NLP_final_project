To prevent the displaced Native Americans from starving, the United States government provided a small set of staple food items, which included the ingredients with which to create a simple quick bread which was cooked in a pan of hot lard over coals and became known as frybread. The food eventually spread to other tribes. Boarding schools also helped to spread frybread in Native American diets.",

Until then, suck it up. You\u2019re not dying.\u201d",
            "Right. I\u2019m being villainized for not upholding family values, but neither are they, but no one ever says anything to them about it. So you can go to Hell with them since you want to back up everything else they do. You might as well.",
            "It is because you try to tell them that the shit they\u2019re doing is not normal or healthy and then they jump all over you. So you just have to leave.",
            "Yea I'm still trying to figure out why I took so long to get out of it.",
            "Yep, every single time someone tries to critise me for not wanting to talk to a family member, I always deflect and make it look like that family member is actually the weird one for treating everyone else like shit.\n\nIt works most of the time, but only in that specific moment. But one week later the will just say the same stuff to you about how you can't cut them out of your lives, etc. \n\nLike the previous conversation meant nothing.",
            "You got something out of it that you needed, attention probably, and being seen.",
            "People are idiots haha",
            "Right lol?!"

            "Same here. I have hobbies that I want to devote my time to at the weekends but I'm always too exhausted to do it, so I end up plonking myself down in front of the TV. The weekend always goes super fast and then when Monday swings around again I feel guilty for not doing anything productive.",
            "This is why I don\u2019t play video games anymore. I feel guilty about the hours wasted playing them, I didn\u2019t used to feel that way, Netflix was next that made me feel guilty, so now when I watch things I do something else at the same time like practice guitar or tinker with something, cook, research how to do my next car repair etc. this helps but not all the way. Reddit I try to do in short bursts. I\u2019ve never downloaded TikTok but I\u2019ve used reals and YouTube shorts and I try to stay away from those as well because the feeling at the end is always horrible. I\u2019ve quit drinking at well, it didn\u2019t help anything but I feel healthier, I try to stay productive as much as possible but it\u2019s always an uphill battle and small victories feel like nothing but the losses give me so much anxiety and guilt it tears me apart emotionally so I try my best. I feel lost most the time. And try not to stress the future as much as I can. Doing literally nothing will either drive me to sadness or anger or both. Sleeping the day away is the worst. I have so little free time and sparse and random days off. So I want to make the most of it but usually I don\u2019t. I sacrifice sleep for time for myself. I hate chores but do them because I must and still feel I wish I had more time first longer than a day for just me and what I really want to do. At least I don\u2019t have children I tell myself. I\u2019m grateful I don\u2019t have any chronic pain and I\u2019m still young -ish but more time and money is still the dream. Anyways I guess I\u2019m rambling but yeah I feel guilty when doing nothing.",
            "Yes, I am like that. Every time I have a free time or do nothing, I feel guilty and waste the good time of my life.",
            "Yes I cannot relax without feeling guilty",
            "Totally! Even superheroes need downtime\u2014just don\u2019t forget to do your cape laundry later.",
            "A bit but you are not doing nothing. You are actively resting!",
            "No",
            "Nah, I also feel it, especially these days that even If I want to rest or do nothing at all, it doesn't feel like it's worth spending your time like that. I'm a bit worried having a sedentary life again after years of depression, that's why being productive occupies my mind and got used to it to the point I constantly think if there any else I could do.",
            "I've had one of those days today and here I am tonight feeling that guilt come on when I could have done so many other things, but I'm trying to be kind to myself as I've just moved cities so it's been a big change managing that and many other things going on in life right now. Thankfully tomorrow is another day and I'll hopefully have the energy to do everything I didn't do today.",
            "Never feel guilty for doing absolutely nothing when you've already done far more hours working to support yourself and your loved ones. I always take 9hrs of every Sunday and do absolutely nothing. Sometimes I split the hours up amongst the day. But most times I take 4.5 during the day, and 4.5 that night. Pick a day of the week and make that your weekly do nothing day. Start at 4hrs that day. And work up from there.",
            "Doing nothing is the GOAL.\n\nWhen you say jobs need doing, what are the consequences of not doing them? I am quick to fix stuff that negatively impacts my family, but I'm happy making rare incremental changs to anything less urgent.",
            "Cognitive dissonance.",
            "Yeah but it just means Im enjoying myself."
