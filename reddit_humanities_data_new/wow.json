            "Possibly a dumb/silly question - seeing how many bajillion raid advertisements (Fyrakk kills, weekly awakened heroic raids, etc) there are in chat now, I wonder - what do these groups do with the gold?  The way their squawking in the chat channels is written it sure looks like some of them are essentially professional raid sellers, they tout that they run every x minutes and some even use like a brand name like \"ZakRaider\" and whatnot.  \n\nWhat in the world can they be using all of this money for?  Is there something not as illicit they can be doing or is it illicit somehow?  It feels like there's no way they're just turning around and throwing that gold for sale on a website or something since it would be pretty easy to tell that someone who just received large sums of gold is now handing them out to x other parties who are then presumably trading to even more other parties?\n\nMaybe I'm off my rocker here, but it's just startling to me how much it seems like raid clears are selling and for the amount of gold they're going for it has to be a ton, even split among a group of carriers.  Just hard to see how it could be anything but essentially a business for real money with how much they seem to be operating.",

            "Anxiety will always play a role when you're doing an important job like healing or tanking.  The things that helped me were realising that not every death is my fault, especially now with how spiky damage is.  If someone dies literally faster than I can react, then it's not my fault.  They either stood in something or didn't use a defensive when they should've.  The only deaths that are my fault are when people are just dying over time and I'm not outputting enough heals to keep them up.  \n\nFocus on not messing up that bit and just doing usual dungeon stuff, contributing kicks, CC, mob control and a little bit of damage and you'll be fine.  Don't freak out when people die within the space of a single global cooldown, the dungeons are just that bursty at the moment. \n\nLearning the fights and damage patterns of the dungeons will happen over time.  You learn pretty quickly which bosses are scary and which trash packs to pop CDs on.\n\nAt the end of the day though, it's a game and you should be enjoying it.

Life is too precious to spend all of it being anxious about what is supposed to be entertainment.",
            "I am going to give you some slightly toxic advice here.\n\nSome runs in MDI were done without healers. Which means good players don't need healers. You are there to heal these idiots because they are idiots who can't use defensive's, interrupt, or some other reason that shows they screwed up and you need to fix it. And if they screw up so badly they end up dying? Fuck em, if they weren't idiots they wouldn't need you.\n\n</toxic advice>\n\n>Is it just getting used to damage spikes and timing?\n\nEssentially yes. Lets say your tank has 100 health for the simplicity of my example. Every 5 seconds the boss does 75 damage to the tank. \n\nSo damage goes out, tank now has 25 HP. You need to heal the tank 51 or more HP within 5 seconds. Notice how I never said back to full? Because they just need to survive the next hit which we know is 75, so they just need to be above 75.\n\nNow lets say a DPS just got hit for 60 damage 3 seconds after the 75 tank hit. There are a few things to consider here. Is this damage of the DPS going to repeat? If so, how long until it does?\n\nKeeping with the example lets say you need 2 seconds to cast a heal. This put you in a situation where you have to heal the tank(or the tank uses a defensive but just roll with me here). You>Tank>DPS. If that DPS takes more than 40 damage in the next 4 seconds(2 sec for Tank heal and 2 for DPS heal) then they die. Thats not on you.\n\nAnd thats something to consider in how encounters are designed. One of the 2 damage instances that would kill the DPS would be avoidable. Otherwise it puts you in an impossible situation. No encounter in M+ is really designed for the healer to fail. Its designed around you being 1 person with a limited ability to heal a limited number of people.\n\n>Appreciate any useful tips or add ons!\n\nIts hard to suggest because of personal preference and comfort plays such a key part. I suggest finding a UI of your choice. You can do a full package like ElvUI, or you can mess with the raid frames provided by Blizzard. You can also combine this with an addon like Vuhdo or Healbot. Also look at mouseover macros(casts a spell over whomever your mouse cursor is hovering over). There is also Clique which allows clicking on raid frames(healbot and Vuhdo do this as part of their standard features).\n\nThen look at either DBM or BigWigs. I prefer DBM because its more in your face about what to do.\n\nCheck out WeakAuras. You can find some nice predone packages for classes.

I think they open up to you at LVL 25. When you have the dungeon finder tool open, you can select raid or dungeon on the left side. Remember that you only get loot once per raid boss per day but unlimited for dungeons. \n\nEspecially as a healer all you have to do at the start is to follow this priority list:\n1. Keep yourself alive \n2. Keep the tank alive\n3. Remove debuffs \n4. Heal the dps player that are nice.\n5. Heal the the rest\n6. Deal damage \n\nThis allows you to also learn the dungeons you are running",

            "You can. The set-up pretty much involves you doing as much achievements that you can do pre lv 20, getting as many threads, etc. You can level through 3 of the zones, do a bunch of the world bosses, get a bunch of normal achivments for scenerios and dungeons. \n\nTruthfully I just spent a night doing heroic dungeons and doing the dailies and was able to get to a point where I just waltz in and out of a dungeon. Harldan has some videos on this",

It takes about 38k bronze to upgrade all pieces once, so ~350k bronze to get around 420. You probly won't need to wait til then though, just apply to any heroic SoO you see up and eventually one'll invite you, there should be at least one maxed out person in the group who can basically solo it so it won't matter if you die every boss.\n\nOnce you get to 476 (fully maxed gear) you can do Mythic SoO if you still need bones, drops 10 instead of 4 and you can get a title for killing every boss",

            "Upgrading gear only makes sense if you have reached level 70 and want to farm more bronze even faster.\n\nI myself have used the bronze to buy transmog and mounts and Toys and will not spend a single dime on upgrading because I know that if I wanted more bronze I would level another character to 70 and cash in 70k bronze as a reward + whatever I made during leveling.\n\nBut I also know what is possible if you max out your gear.\nIt takes a lot of up front investment but you get a lot of bronze in return. But you are also stuck on that one upgraded character as you can't really transfer bronze to your second or third or fourth.... Character.\n\nSo this is for you to decide. There is still plenty of time to invest bronze into upgrades and then farm bronze in raids every day and with that buy all the mounts. But there is also enough time to level every class to 70. Farm bronze that way and buy all the mounts",
            "Yep! \n\nI will say it gets substantially faster after you do the dailies on your twink for a week or two. There's a huge difference between a level 20 twink with 100 int vs 800 int\n\nhttps://youtu.be/iS1k8HOYDTo?si=CZYRqNNS7M4hVUsP. This is a really good guide of optimizing the level 20",
            "If you're just doing the raid on normal, you need to do it 20 times. The lockout is reset every day and not week.\n\nSo 20 days in a row would get you what you need.  Less if you push into heroic and mythic.",
            "Up to you, really. Anywhere from 400-600+% XP bonus depending on your level already \n\n(You get permanent XP bonus by completing raids while under Level 70)",

            "I suppose it will transfer but you won't get much out of them. I expect the leveling gear at the start of the next expansion to be miles better than what you can get in remix.\n\nThe reason people upgrade their gear is to feel powerful and to farm the raids faster and thus get more bronze and threads for the cloak.\n\nThe actual power comes from your cloak at the end of the day. And that will just disappear once remix ends.\nYou'll also lose the gems that give stats and the gems that give you fancy active and passive skills. Another reason for me to not get too invested because the power drop off would be too large and I want to play the characters later again and progress them higher than they were before and they just wouldn't be if I juiced them to the maximum during remix. But that is just a personal thing I have. Other people see this probably differently and are fine with that",
            "That definitely works for me. Now I can level certain classes without stressing over upgrades. I can also focus on just unlocking whatever I want to unlock. Thanks for all the helpful replies today, much appreciated!"

No need to hike than number up further for weapons.\n\nRegardless, if I don't manage to unlock everything, I'll be okay.

I think my ideal would be a vendor that sells a box that gives one of these appearances at random- maybe with a bias towards things your class can use, but not restricted to it- with no possibility of overlap. This would give people who really want every weapon appearance a reasonable way to farm them (with bronze, like everything else), while keeping the slight uniqueness of these weapons during season 4.\n\nOr just add the weapons as purchasable during the last month. That would work too.",

(And just imagine queueing for LFR repeatedly only to go through an entire run of all the available wings for a day and get none of the drops...

There are always a couple 476s transmog hunting that don't even need the rest of the raid. The \"tanks\" and \"healers\" wouldn't even need to switch specs if they didn't want lol. I've soloed normal ToT already, so LFR would be a breeze. \n\nOr Blizzard could open up solo queue LFR, or just flat out ignore the tank/healer requirement.",
            "u don't need to do anything.\n\nthe transmogs are ugly and chances are u'd barely use anything, and the new transmogs from the new expansions/patches are better.\n\nidk, farming transmogs that u don't have any plan for is dumb, just a waste of time cause it isnt even fun",

            "No you don\u2019t. You\u2019re never going to use these anyway. When you get stress in this game it\u2019s time to go outside.",
            "if you have a huge 476 character of a class that can heal/tank, queue for those roles\n\nalso found out recently that you can queue for multiple LFR wings at once and they frequently chain pop as you clear them",

            "I wasn't aware these items were purchasable on PTR",
            "Usually I'd agree with this sentiment, but the weapon issue is really a glaring issue.  Its not about wanting to be done in an afternoon, but I've long been done with bronze, I have my gear fully upgraded, everything from the vendors purchased, all the weapons from normal/heroic/mythic done, and yet trying to get specific weapons from LFR or zone cache drops is beyond absurd in the current method.  Surely there's a middle ground between a totally RNG slogfest and being done in an afternoon.",
            "Dude, I'm happy to play the game.  But I'm about a day or two (depending on how frisky I feel) from having every mount, every toy, every world, dungeon, and raid ensemble.  I have a 476 character, and another with some gear.  I have multiple characters I've leveled to 70.  I've put a shitload of hours into the event.\n\nI want to play the game.  What I DON'T want is to have my time wasted.  I've spent plenty of time going around blasting mobs in the open world, killing an insane number of mobs without seeing a single one of the many random drops I still need.  I don't want to have to go run LFR and Normal raids over and over long after I've gotten all the items I can buy with Bronze just so I can pray to RNGsus.  There's a good chance I end up running multiple days in a row and maybe get one out of many drops.  Meaning almost all of those runs will have been a complete waste of time, because the Bronze I'm earning can't buy anything.\n\nIt sure as hell didn't take me just an afternoon to buy all of these ensembles, mounts, and toys, so that is a remarkable stupid comment to make.  And given that people are asking for ensembles which would require Bronze and you'd have to play the game to earn the Bronze to buy them, that's clearly not what anyone's asking for.\n\nYour whole spiel here is you complaining that the whole concept of MoP Remix is bad.  I mean, after all, they designed the whole thing to let us earn currency to just buy a bunch of mounts and transmog without having to run content over and over hoping for lucky drops.  Which makes it weird that they'd add in new stuff that is low drop chance and only available during the event, and runs contrary to the entire setup of the event.  An event which, again, you clearly hate with a burning passion, because it removes ridiculous RNG grinds and replaces them with grinding a currency where you seem to think someone can earn ~1.65M of said currency in a single afternoon... making one question whether you aren't actually playing the game yourself which would explain such ignorance, or if you know your comments are way off base and you're just saying something incredibly dumb just to be argumentative.",
            "People don't want to rely on RNG and having to play multiple classes in end-game content to hopefully get the transmog they're after...this isn't an unreasonable request. You might be able to get into mythic SoO without upgrading your gear with bronze but it's iffy, based wholly on how many 476s are already in and if the raid leader is feeling generous.",
            "Yes, it \"counts time\" while you're in an instance with a queue going, so at the end of it, you've been in queue a long time and have priority. If you're doing multiple LFRs, *never* do them one-by-one, queue as many as you can at once (and ideally queue up the next in between). I think you can get 8 instances queued at once before it says too many? But makes you take like a 10-second break every couple.\n\nIt works just for scenario+dungeon, too. Scenario will pop in a couple minutes, by the time it's done you're in the front of the dungeon queue.",
            "This is really useful info, thank you!",
            "This is what I do, any class that *can* tank or heal I queue as, then just blast the place.",
            "Bows/crossbows are easy as hunters on mm/bm loot spec have very narrow loot pool. Be sure you have a correct lootspec set, as survival has different loot pool.\n\nDon't get me wrong, \"45min+\" is \"easy\" compared to other specs.",
            "Priest, Warrior, Hunter. I think that should cover everything.",
            "Sadly no, just scenarios and a guy for the Scarlet Monastery and Scholo zones since we can't travel there.",
            "Oh, I thought all the recolors were in the vendors.  \nMy mistake.",
            "The weapons weren't, remix was just very different than what launched and people greatly preferred that.",
            ">An event which, again, you clearly hate with a burning passion,\n\ni dont, which is why i dont mind playing more if i truely want the weapons instead of crying on reddit how i cant afk farm bronze and just buy it",
            "> People don't want to rely on RNG and having to play multiple classes in end-game content to hopefully get the transmog they're after\n\nThis is where you lose me. I feel like I am taking insanity pills.\n\nHow is this not exactly how transmog works literally since its creation and outside of this 1 event has always worked?",
            "Yes, I know how loot spec works. \ud83d\ude44 I only ever play ranged hunters. I'm getting plenty of bows. Just not the right one. There are multiple colors of \"Tortoiseshell Longbow\" that drop from LFR, a red one and the much rarer blue one. I've had dozens of the red one drop, but no blue after running the entire raid every day for several weeks now. The only thing that makes me think the database is correct and keeps me going is that people on WoWhead have said they've gotten it. I have never even seen it drop for anyone else - I have an addon that alerts me if missing transmogs do. \n\nIt wouldn't be so intolerable if the queue time wasn't so long. 45 min is what the *queue time* is generally. So I'm not sure what specs you think have that worse, since I have no choice but to queue as DPS.",
            "Keep in mind collecting every personal loot (greens - lfr, world, scenarios, dungeons) on warrior will take forever due to its largest elligible loot pool. You will get many more duplicates, so chances of getting the remaining loot is slim.",
            "Priest for wands, hunter for ranged, warrior for everything else is that? \ud83d\ude0a",
            "Yeah that works too I just hate warrior and prefer pally",
            "I prefer the PTR versions where there is a big ass Tauren who hands me any gear I want over live too",
            "The sourcing of the other transmog won't cease to exist in a month and a half",
            "In less than 60 days my understanding is that these appearances are gone, they're unique to Remix.  And they drop based on what class you are, so a minimum of hunter, warrior, and caster needed. \n\nThere is no farming then in Retail later on.",
            "\"So I'm not sure what specs you think have that worse, since I have no choice but to queue as DPS\"\n\nWell, eg ToT LFR: hunter mm/bm has 7 elligible items pool. Eg mage (or any other cloth spec) has 26 elligible items pool. That's much more lower chance for a mage player to get a targeted mog. It is similar with most specs. And queue times are the same.\n\nYes, in this remix case priest is bis for lfr healer queues, wands, and cloth offhands.\n\nLong queues as dps? Get a healer/tank friend and queue together.\n\nOne more thing: horde and alliance queues were \"hotfixed\" to be separate, and iirc alliancie has lower population hence longer queues for alliance toons.",
            "Yep. I know it's unlikely to happen but it's just a goal I set. I'm used to failing my goals lol.",

And the state of Remix right now is that only one person per instance actually gets to play (and even then \"press a button to destroy everything\" isn't much in the way of playing), and it's frustrating for a lot of people.\n\nIt's the reason I'm puttering around in Season 4 instead of playing Remix right now myself. I have all the cosmetic stuff I want, and I have no interest in spending my time trying to keep up with someone else as they run through a dungeon instagibbing everything in sight just so I can make some numbers high enough that I can then make four other people try to keep up with me as I run through a dungeon instagibbing everything in sight.\n\nIf you like that kind of thing, that's great, I'm genuinely glad that this experience is available to you.  \nIt's just not for me.",

Your rotation doesn't matter, your contribution likely won't matter, and after boosting myself for hundreds of runs I have never not gotten the loot mailed to me.\n\nSo, if you are one of these people go do some high keys or whatever they do nostalgia wow instead, or just stop fucking complaining about every.

I \\*love\\* playing with other familiar/experienced players because their expertise and skill are invaluable, but being basically dragged along, unable to even get a cast off just isn't enjoyable.",

Theres people who think they are op at twinked 20 or 70 that have not made enough progress to solo bosses in a timely manner on their own yet.

I at least kind of get when people do it with console games but if you're tech savvy enough to play a PC game you should be capable of using a web browser.\n\n I'm guessing it probably looks OK on small phone screens the same way early low bitrate mp3's sounded \"fine\" as long as you were using shitty headphones?",
            "It's common courtesy on Reddit. You're sharing it to a sub with 2.6 million subscribers, if you're going to be asking that many people to look at your post, put the effort in.\n\nSame reason people that type badly get downvoted.",

            "Oh, not at all, I haven't played in a while now. I'm not even sure what Remix is. \n\nI was referring to Pandaria what it first came out. The panda race was one of Blizzard's notorious April's Fools jokes from back* in the Warcraft 3 era. And removing talent trees was another AF joke from a few years before MoP.\n\nSo when MoP dropped, it kind of woke me up to how deeply the game had changed from this Warcraft universe fantasy into.. a weird new thing with brand new imagined elements to appeal to new players. Like Kung Fu Panda fans. An Eastern themed xpac may have been cool, but I can't stand Jack Black or the whole fantasy that fists compare to guns, armor and magic. And these eyesores got to come in with this fancy new class that can dps, tank, and *heal*? \n\nIt was all just too much. But you know, I had been addicted for years and it helped break me from the game for a while. Now, I can pick it up again for a couple of months when an expansion drops, see what there is to see, and set it back down again.",

I did hardcore raiding for about a year. When it really clicked that I was putting as much time into WoW as one would a job I started cutting back. So now I\u2019m very selective of what activities I participate in and Remix has been great because you can make a lot of progress with just a little time invested.\n\nI\u2019m not saying any of this applies to you.
