It can now yield Hell furniture, Shadow Chest loot, and even a Lava Charm. Also, you can get a generic Bobber accessory from the Angler, which can be stacked with the Angler Earring and be combined with any Glowing Moss for a brightened bobber.",
            "crate loot.\n\nin my corruption world, I'm always happy when I fish up heartreach potions, as the fish needed to craft it is a crimson world only thing.\n\nI also find when I do a lot of fishing for crates that I almost never need to craft an obsidian skin potion, since those show up in crates fairly often.",

Summoner is getting more whips which will be nice too. Consider that the four classes don't need to be equal in terms of skill. Mage is a good stepping off point for intermediate players who have gotten used to playing the easier classes of Melee and Ranger, requiring you to dodge more and play smarter but with the benefit of many healing weapon options, attack variety, and many more homing weapons. Summoner is better suited to multiplayer when other players can take the heat off of you, and gives you the advantage of getting to focus almost entirely on dodging and running at the cost of attacks hurting more.",
