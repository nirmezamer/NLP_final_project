            "Actually, it's all pretty logical. Remember, overextension is not about how other countries view your nation - it's about how well your administration is dealing with newly acquired territories. Or rather the problems which arise when your administration can't keep up with the task at hand.\n\nOf course your national unrest and corruption go up. Somewhere in your realm there are vast tracts of territory where there is no law or order (yet). Which means that all the people who might oppose you go there to catch some fish in muddy waters. Or exploit the fact that administration in your core regions is weakened because they have to send some of their best and brightest to restore order in new lands. Or feel emboldened because your empire doesn't look so tough anymore.\n\nOf course your stability modifier shoots through the roof. It represents the effort to improve public order, which becomes pretty hard when there are patches of land with no effective oversight. Ditto for diplomatic efforts - it's the age where the number of educated civil servants was limited, so if you send all your promising courtiers to build up administration in conquered territories, you can't very well send them abroad to do diplomatic things, can you?\n\nAnd of course, the mercenary costs shoot through the roof. The game doesn't represent it at all, but EU4 covers eras when military forces were much less uniform and controlled by the state than they are today. Even \"normal\" regiments were often units raised by rich individuals in the name of the ruler, rather than being created by the government from start to finish as we do it today. Delays in pay, plundering soldatesca, mixed loyalties - it was like that. It was normal.\n\nSo you have an administration which has rather tenuous control over its regular army. Then add to it that it's not even nation's own army, it's mercs. Then add to it that your administration is overworked and buckles under pressure trying to quickly establish control over new conquests. The governance which would be considered bad by modern standards becomes simply abyssmal. So of course the costs shoot through the roof - money is being stolen on every step of the way, payouts are delayed, mercs are getting restless and suspicious...\n\nAnd in some village which was unfortunate enough to be close to mercs it might mean that the mercs start kidnapping local residents for ransom.
