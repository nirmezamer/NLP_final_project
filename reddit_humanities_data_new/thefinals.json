It's that this new influx of rage quitting lights when you have an hour to play that make me say \"ok fuck this im going to bed\".\n\nI hope it comes back around, the whole idea and atmosphere of a sport people watch where vr people compete for cash boxes is perfect. They should be building on that not looking for other avenues. Just my opinion and tbh I liked TA as a side option, but having it the main mode is whack af",

            "I like the map, basement dwelling rules, gaining high ground isn\u2019t a instant farm fest, multiple attack paths for cash outs and it\u2019s very pretty. \nProbably a little too big, only becomes a problem on a horrid respawn.",
            "I really enjoy it as well. Obviously looks are great, but I also like how the map plays. It has its specific playstyle, just like the other maps, with some very cramped buildings and some vast open areas. I feel it accommodates all play styles (I manage to make the dagger shine on this map for example because flanking is so fast). \n\nI feel it\u2019s a good thing that maps makes you change your playstyle, you can\u2019t expect to play the same way on all maps. \n\nI\u2019m just iffy about the basements because teams that bunker up there are so hard to attack.",

            "I like it very much. \nThe only critique I have is that it's very hard to fight indoors as a Heavy after any destruction has been done to the building. It sometimes becomes impossible to climb to the top since the only two stairs are blocked by rubble.\nThis didn't seem to be a problem with previous maps so helpfully they can improve on this.",

I want some challenge to my thought process lol\n\nIncoming bitter downvotes from people who don't like that I like things that they don't lol. Welcome to gaming folks",
            "The fps drops are killing me. I usually can get a pretty consistent 80 fps but on kyoto i drop to 50 even with no destruction going on. I really hope they add some kind of performance rendering simillar to fortnite as well as latest scaling tech. If you fly around kyoto there is a lot of bamboos out of bounds which may be one of the reasons.",

Its the matchmaking ruining it for me at least",
            "You might be right, but in my mind whatever mode a game turns into ranked is usually the most \"legitimate/desirable to do good in\"\n\nAnd simply since it was the mode that built the game, I just feel if I want to play a siege mode ill just play r6 siege instead.

After I reach gold 1 I plan to play ranked TA and see what I can grind to. I\u2019ve played the prelims and started at silver 1 so I can\u2019t wait to see how I rank with others. I do think however that TA in ranked feels just a little long at 13 rounds. Maybe three teams and two games at 7 rounds a peice. Might be better",
            "You're not wrong!\n\nIts the matchmaking that gets me, its the teams I'm put with in world tour, I don't really care about rank and all that but I'd still like to win some games. This season I just get matched with people who only care about kills it seems",
            "I see what you\u2019re saying. The matchmaking does feel a bit off. I would like to see some sort of rank coinciding with how much money you\u2019ve banked or something in world tour, maybe to help filter out the people who don\u2019t want to really try. I dunno",

And after the buff light is pretty strong even tho it might not still be the best class for a competitive setup (cashout), hence many play it in world tour. \n\nPersonally I couldn\u2019t care less what class my teammates pick in world tour. It\u2019s so easy to carry as a solo light for me so they can play whatever they want. Gotta say tho there are many frustrating players that play the light class pretty bad, like running around completely alone etc which gives the light class a bad reputation. As a light you shouldn\u2019t be on your teammates bc in that case you are an easy pick but you should still be close and flank and give info etc. Light have gadgets that makes fights so much easier and have potential to break up an enemy team very easily. \n\nSo if you are unlucky you get those teammates that just plays solo, but the class itself is not the problem it\u2019s the perception of how it should be played by lower skilled players! But that goes for every class, and the game consists of a big amount of lower level players! IMO of course",

You complain about being left alone, dying alone and not receiving any support when you can be giving loads to the lights.

            "I really don't get the light hate. I personally don't like playing light myself, but I don't mind having two of them on my team IF they know what they're doing. I feel like light is the more difficult class where you can't cover up your screw-ups as easily, but I'd rather play with 2 great light players than with 2 heavies with a god complex - coming from someone who mains medium with healing beam.\n\nIt can be more difficult to properly support light players with healing and stuff, but most of them tend to retreat when they're low on HP, I quickly heal them up and they return to battle. I've won lots of games with competent light players by my side. But as I said, light feels like the \"difficult\" class and many of them just run and explode all the time - but I've also had mediums refusing to work together, not using their healing beam at all and heavies believing their team has to serve them.\n\nSo yeah, all builds have great players I enjoy playing with and the most annoying jerks ever. There's no reason to hate one build just because there are some idiots.",

The only thing that changes in world tours is knowing when to go absolutely bonkers and when to chill and rez/defend etc. \n\nI think the complaint exists because lots of light players don't get it and just always run in headfirst.\n\nBut like u said, even conceptually you're not supposed to be aware of your light player. If u deal with your guy and u get enemy team wipe then your lights done his job. His job isn't to double up ur engages or clean up ur missed frags, it's to force man advantage and land tonnes of dmg.",

            "Yeah that's my problem with the gamemode; every game feels extremely inconsistent. Most games I'm playing with a rookie, and in a best case scenerio maybe someone half competent. Wins often feel hollow, losses often feel horrible.                    \nPeople who conflate the 'cash total leaderboard' to sbmm have no idea what they're talking about or haven't played both old and 'new' ranked/world tour to make the comparison. At best world tour is casual cashout with rewards and a leaderboard which means nothing. For people who only played casual; this is a net positive. For people who only play ranked; this is definitely a drag to put it mildly.                   \nLets be clear when we say this, the old ranked system for cashout *didn't* have problems with sbmm; it had a *playerbase* issue especially in some regions where it was hard to find matches at all. So that's why you'd have silvers playing in matches vs a diamond 3 stack. Simply because no one was playing ranked; not because that's how bad the sbmm was.       \nSo I'm curious what Embark is doing to 'fix ranked' as yes the game generally still need balance changes, but idk what they could possibly do to fix the sbmm. If anything I could see them addressing problems people had with how their rank was calculated; but again that's not gunna matter if the playerbase is still small and you wind up in silver/diamond lobbies. Sounds like this season was more the 'pull in more fans by attempting to appeal to a wider audience', and then hope those people maybe move over to other game modes and 'fix' the playerbase/match making issues.",
            "As a new player I can confirm this is zero fun for me either.\n\nAs a solo player level 11, I am constantly matched with new players that leave after the first death, don\u2019t group or play objective or are just camping in a building. Meanwhile I am put usually against fully decked out pre made teams with the latest cosmetics getting ten thousands of damage and 70K  cash while in voice comms.\n\nI hope they fix this because you don\u2019t learn anything and I never even got to the second round in around 40 games. This will chase new players back to COD, Apex, Xdefiant etc quickly. Which is a shame because the finals is a good game in concept and execution.\n\nGive me a solo queue and some welcome playlist with some sbmm.",

            "I feel like sbmm is really off in general this season. I mean, I know it\u2019s literally off in world tour but even with the other game modes there is a pattern of matching one team full of random players new and old against some elite squad that probably spend their free time doing training exercises. They are generally very organised and clearly communicating. It makes for a very quick and one sided game. Not much fun.",
            "I agree! And this is what makes me so confused about all this \u201cno sbmm is great\u201d discourse that\u2019s been so trending with Xdefiant recently. \n\nHow is it fun when the lobby is completely unbalanced in terms how skilled players?",
            "World tour Vs Quick Cash\n\nIs it just me ?\n\nNow first off I'll admit, I'm not brilliant but we are competent we get wins and good amount of kills but.\n\nWe play quick cash and it goes really well, kills keep coming as do the cash outs.\n\nWe switch to world tour yes despite having won rounds and actually won a tour on the whole get absolutely stuffed, with opponents that seemingly never miss, some odd glitch were the flame thrower seems to do no damage to melee attacking Heavy's zero hit markers, it's as iff the hit boxes are off \n\nAnd the biggest issue, half the lobby has a good game with a good spread of kills across the teams yes one team or 1 player in 2 of the other teams has a ridiculous 20+ kills to 5 deaths ?\n\nMaking the game feel very lopsided and unenjoyable.\n\nThis is my take on world tour",
            "SBMM would kill WT's casual vibe, but solo Q with bad teammates is the worst",
            "This is what I was tryna say before, I wasn\u2019t quite top 100 but I was high in diamond and playing with and against new/low level players is no fun. Either, with all due respect, my teammates can\u2019t keep up or my enemies are all rather oblivious, obviously because they\u2019re newer or a lower skill level, which isn\u2019t a problem, I just don\u2019t want to play in the same lobby as them. \n\nIt also makes kills and wins feel empty.",
            "The SBMM is there. It's just all over the place. It's very common to see players put into same game based on team average skill rather than getting players individual skill into consideration. This makes it so you often end up with bad players and have to carry them but game doesn't care because your team's average skill/mmr is the same as a squad of 3 equally skilled players that may be worse than you but are still much better than your teammates and the fights are pretty much you vs 3 of them cause your teammates are dead before the fight really starts. \n\nIt's nothing new really when it comes to matchmaking nowadays in games. It's done to make bad and new players feel the win after getting carried instead of making them improve by playing with similarly skilled players as them",
            "I did manage to win one with a friend,\n\nMost games across all the teams mist people say get 10 kills.\n\nBut recently I've had players going 20 kills and 4 deaths across 2 teams and in multiple games, it spoils it and makes it unenjoyable.",
