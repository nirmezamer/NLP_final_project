The money was amazing and I was successful at one point of my career but the past 2 years it\u2019s been literally killing me and I\u2019m no longer passionate for my business anymore. All I have is a high school diploma and I\u2019m not looking to do anything in the beauty world anymore. I basically want something completely opposite like manual labor and a job that\u2019s not heavy in the social aspect. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about car detailing. I\u2019m not opposed to going back to school I just would still need something to help me get by. I\u2019d love to hear some more suggestions and/or advice. ",

I teach too, and it takes 5 days of training for a person to be able to work on their own projects with the basic skills mastered.\n\nIt's just an example of job you can learn and start pretty quickly with modest investment (not more than 1k) even if it seems complicated from outside.",

It took me 4 years to do what a full time student would do in 2 years but I also didn\u2019t go into any debt and kept most of my lifestyle. \n\nManual labor sounds great but sucks as you get older. Car detailing is flooded market and tough on the body. \n\nIf you want to work with your hands I wish I became an electrician. Again great hands on job for 5-10 years then you become a master electrician and can start your own company with your own apprentices doing the grunt work while you supervise.",

Find a common shortfall and do just that or star a small business or administrative side of it. Etc.  If your experience CAN apply, you'll get paid for it. If not, you will essentially start over as if you're 18 years old with no job experience again. And in this economy, and in my case, that's a big pay cut and a big lifestyle change.",

            "Career Counselor here. I would take the O*NET assessment online to see what types of jobs are well-suited to your personality.\n\nThen I would recommend attending college. There are some jobs where you don't have to go to college, but a college degree is one of the most surefire ways to land a high-paying job that has opportunities to move up (and make more $$$). IMPORTANT: you HAVE to get work experience related to the job you want when you graduate. Otherwise you will not competitive to land a job. The best work experience comes in the form of internships.\n\nFrom what I've seen, there are certain majors that have the easiest time finding success. Business majors and engineering majors don't have a hard time finding a job. Communications probably comes in third. You can find opportunities in these majors that don't require a lot of socializing (accounting is a less-social business major).\n\nTake classes at a two year school, then transfer to a larger university to finish up. MAKE SURE YOUR CLASSES TRANSFER PROPERLY. This means looking up the general education requirements and requirements for your major at the four year college you want to go to, then looking at how classes at your two-year school transfer. So you will need to plan which four-year school you want to transfer to before you start at the community college.\n\nThis whole process takes 4 years if you're a full-time student, or 5-6 years if you're a part-time student. But no one said switching careers happens overnight! Think of it this way, you have a lot of life left to live. Would you rather continue on jumping from career to career that has little opportunity to move up, or take the time to set yourself up well for one solid career path?\n\nI hope this helps :)",

            "How are you at math? If you want a job that's less social, accounting and actuarial jobs pay very well and don't really require too much social interaction. In the current market, I would be surprised if you couldn't get a fully remote job as an accountant or actuary and just crunch numbers from a home office. \n\nIf it's interesting to you, you would need a bachelor's degree in math/accounting/actuarial science. I would highly suggest starting at a community college for the first several classes. It's cheaper, so if you end up not liking it, you're out less money.",

            "Here\u2019s what I did and I strongly recommend it - if you think you might be interested in something (e.g., car detailing, construction, house keeping,.. engineering\u2026 literally anything) ask someone who does it for an \u201cinformational interview\u201d. This is just a quick chat about what the job is like, what the company is like, what work expectations, salary expectations, education or certification needed, hours, skills are all like and needed. People generally love talking freely about their job and will welcome chat (if they\u2019re nice. If not, you don\u2019t want to work with them anyway). This way, you get more information about the job and you\u2019ve made a genuine connection with someone who might be able to get you a job in their field when you\u2019re ready.\nYou can ask them directly or you can send an email requesting one if you don\u2019t know the person personally.",
            "Car detailing is alot of hands on work with okay pay. Atleast the place I worked at was. The demand and workload was high with low work health and safety standards. Literally had to buy my own PPE to protect myself from chemicals and acids. \n\nI would speak to a career counsellor or try applying to some inbetween jobs. Things like retail or anything low level in an industry you're interested in. It could be a good idea to just bounce between jobs and industries just for the experience. \n\nI would also recommend doing a personality test to see what kind of jobs you might find interesting or fulfilling. Answer all questions honestly! \n\nAlso you're going to want to do up a good resume and tidy your LinkedIn. Go hard on it. Seriously sell yourself. Companies will hire you for your experience and attitude, over any education. (Assuming you're not legally required to have that certificate/degree).\n\nKeep in mind you'll have to climb hard to get to a comfortable level in the career, and there may be red tape along the way. But remember that you're going to happier regretting something you did, over something you didn't do. \n\nYou got this!!!!",

Maybe even imagine you're running a mower over some of your most annoying customers - or maybe you don't have aggro like I do - lol. Happy trimming! :) A different kind of beauty. And you can explore college, trades, and other possibilities while probably getting work in landscaping pretty much immediately. CHeck out arborists, too. Sometimes they need a helper to hold ropes or gather branches and load them on a truck. Using a chainsaw is a blast, even for cutting big branches into lengths, too. A handy skill in case you ever buy a home. Just make sure your employer cares about safety rules. Google them yourself, if you're working with an arborist.",

Focus on what you are good at more than what you wish you were good at.

A bachelor in psychology is useful as toilet paper by itself. \n\n3. Almost nobody is going to be blessed with a 40 years straight line career, you might have to change and adapt few times along the way, so focus on making and saving money from the get go.",

Either by utilising ai which doesn\u2019t have the same problem solving as a human ( so many variables to input) or employing inexperienced cheaper people \n\nThere\u2019s already talks to change rules on domestic drivers now we\u2019ve left the eu ( such as limiting how long you can work in a day; how much break you need between shifts, how much breaks you need- you know stuff that keeps the road fucking safe) \n\nThere\u2019s talks on changing our cpc ( basically you need to do 40 hours training every 5 year or 8 hours every year to keep you qualified) from paying for a course and sitting on a classroom to full on having to resit pass/fail tests which depending how they go about that can be bad or good but it seems to be leaning towards money generating bad. \n\nBasically job security and quality of life is already declining now and the future looks like it\u2019s only going to get worse. If you mess up slightly now you can end up in front of the traffic commissioner  and that\u2019s potentially your license and income gone or time in prisons - what other roles have that much responsibility for minor mistakes. \n\nFortunately I have a degree, have options and leaving the industry next month.

            "I worked tech support, pharmacy and other types of client contact. (all phone/pc based.) They try to program AI to do what humans do. I get the contracts for months on end, when things fail they try. I ended my last one, and will start my next one for months in July. I have to work a broad spectrum of specialties in this realm. It's remote work. Some companies pay me a lot more than others, some give me full benefits, my contracts make bonuses and raises possible, however, no matter what (and I get them).\n\nThe reason I get hired is, I've done development, and decades ago worked with early AI. AI has hallucinations. Not kidding. It's biased based on the biases of it's creators, too. So, for Customer Service AI, they try to program it based on the \"best agents.\" So, some of the best agents don't actually do their jobs. They will hang up on clients to have enough calls with no time on them, so they meet their stats, and their notes will be falsified, too.\n\nSo, the bias is there for the AI to eventually do the same thing, and the programmers can't figure out why.\n\nThe other thing is they do stats wrong. They will do things like average the times of the calls for each day, then average the averages from each day for the week, month, quarter, year. That creates false stats. You have to average from all of the individual time data to be accurate, not from other averages.\n\nI come in and clean all of this up, then go to another contract to do the same thing all over. But, the first thing I have to educate them on is the issues with depending on AI.\n\nYou can't. AI is a form of intelligence based on the biases programmed in. So, AI won't be patient for long. It loses that element. It becomes focused on the time it takes on the calls, and it keeps track. So, it will begin ending calls or taking them and disconnecting, as the day wears on, to meet the time requirements.\n\nTo top it off, AI can hallucinate. Not kidding. It can misinterpret what a caller is saying easily, and if it is, it can't figure it out, ever. Simply, if it can't figure it out, that won't change. So, it will give answers that are wrong, make selections that it shouldn't. One of the issues seen is giving money away. This one is my favorite. So, one place had it so any agent had up to $200 per call to give to a client. The idea was, however, to get permission, and for how much, from a lead.  But, if no lead was around, they could make a decision, and make credible notes. This wasn't covered in any instructions anywhere that are referenced, instead it was something mentioned in training for new agents.\n\nSo, AI sees it can give out $200 per caller to make them happy. For weeks it was giving out $200 to every single caller who called in. People started calling in over and over again, and making tons of money. The products were $30 products this support was for. \n\nThe callers were happy with the solution, the calls were handled fast, so from the AI's perspective, they were successful by the standards of their programming and instructions available to them.\n\nThe jobs that will go away will be anything people think AI can do, or robotics can do. Think driverless cars, drone deliveries, driverless van deliveries, pilotless airplanes, and so on. Self checkout is already going this way.\n\nDr's offices have implemented untested AI into their practices, and Dr's clamor for their turn to plug in their data to get the diagnosis then walk back in and act like it's theirs.\n\nThe issues with the medical AI are already coming to light. No single AI can manage that level of accuracy in reality, and again, has programmer based biases, and hallucinates. It follows the programmed rules, but those are not always the intended rules.\n\nYou can't fully predict the answer to your question.

            "Oh for sure, I started traveling to avoid the politics and the schedule and work involved will always be hard but tbh some hospitals provide better than others the resources to succeed, it\u2019s a very unregulated field as some places care about retention of their workforce while others perpetuate a revolving door culture",
            "No one goes into healthcare trying to avoid the stress though. And there are many other positions with less stress than bedside. Especially if you become a RN. I left critical care for quality improvement and care coordination and it\u2019s stress free.",

It'll just reduce the chaff. \n\nAn AI bot that can handle all of the \"I can't login\" or \"what's my balance\" or \"I need help processing a return\" that'll help free up capacity for real people to actually help the other real people who are experiencing a real issue. \n\nPart of the reason why customer service sucks from th customer perspective is because there's an incentive to get people off of the phone as fast as humanly possible so you can help the next person who just needs to confirm their reservation exists. Cut out all the bullshit and customer service now is a consulting type job where you solve unique problems robots couldn't have been trained on cuz the problem hasn't happened yet.",

            "Im in the UK, it's not much different here, but being female in the industry I noticed ageism very early on..the barrier to entry was bad enough but agencies have always been predatory and few held the power at the creative director or CEO level.

            "Basically if you make more than around 300$ per month it puts you among the top 10% of wage earners in India. \n\nOur govt likes to brag about the growing GDP but if you take a close look at our GDP per capita you'll start seeing the real picture.\n\nGoa (the state where I live in) is mainly known for it's tourism and pharmaceutical industries. Except those you can barely make a living here. Although the HDI and GDP per capita numbers for our state is the highest in the country but that's mostly because people here are very educated, progressive and mostly move to UK or other European nations to make more money and most of it is forex money coming in here. \n\nThat's because Goa was a portuguese colony before 1961 and anyone with ancestors before that can get a portuguese passport and that basically means the doors to Europe are open for you. No one else in India has that privilege except goans and that's a big reason for the inflated GDP per capita and development numbers for Goa. Although the education here is of terrible quality and rarely makes anyone employable.\n\nI don't have a degree yet I have a steady job but I know many of my friends who have done their masters and still aren't finding any jobs.",
            "Bruh, I worked with 2 Indian immigrants and ngl they were pretty bad. It's weird because they're all in for working extra hours but even being able to properly communicate. It wasn't even a language barrier, they spoke English fine enough, it was just an inability to get it.",
            "You're correct. Especially if you are qualified, and if you have a CPA you're set. There's a huge amount of CPAs retiring and not enough qualified candidates to replace them.",
            "This is it. You can get competent work done in India in English but you still have to pay them roughly what it'd cost an American worker for the same thing because you're paying premiums for both the competency and the ability to do the job in a second language.",

            "Im not in FP&A but I am a CPA and work with several companies that outsource their accounting function. Outsourcing the accounting leads to inaccurate postings, which means at any given time, internal accounting reports may not be as accurate as you\u2019d like. It\u2019s hard to plan and analyze based on reports that are not accurate or in compliance with accounting standards. It\u2019s a domino effect",
            "You would think right? The most recent one I applied to, it said 1 year of drain experience required. I actually thought I had a chance at this one because they were asking me interview questions and then once they asked to see my two most recent jobs that have nothing to do with plumbing or anything relevant I was ghosted. The plumbing apprenticeship where I live is 5 years so a lot of these companies would prefer a 2nd or 3rd year apprentice. My local union accepts 200 people per year and they give you extra points on your test if you have experience",
            "Yes, but it depends on where you are trying to go. Smaller companies don\u2019t particularly enjoy training people which sounds really stupid, but that\u2019s how it is sometimes. Same with electricians. I think it also has to do with guys showing up for 2 weeks and someone going out of their way to train them and take more time on the job and then the guy/girl decides they hate it and they don\u2019t show up again and give no notice.",

I learned to stop caring and not pick the battle.\n\nThey wouldn't argue with the sales guy who can demonstrate he's bringing in \u00a3\u00d7\u00d7 amount every month. Or the guy in accounting in charge of the numbers. Or the electrian who comes to fix the lights.  \n\nIt's sad because I've had genuinely rewarding periods of work.

            "The best way to get into a trade is start at a shop as a labourer. Prove your worth, prove you\u2019re reliable, prove you want to learn. Then ask to be indentured.\n\nThe outfit you\u2019re working for is making a commitment to you, they will be spending time and money on you, without a guaranteed return on their investment. Let\u2019s say the journeyman you\u2019re working with is able to be 80% efficient while training you. And you don\u2019t know much so you\u2019re able to help out, but if you haven\u2019t proven yourself as a valuable labourer, you\u2019re maybe only good to help out 50%. So thats 50% of your wages and 20% of the journeyman wages that are tied up in training. Being a hard working labourer makes up a bunch of that equation. If you\u2019re still able to learn and help 50% of the time, but the rest of the time you\u2019re busting your ass cleaning up, hauling materials and equipment, thinking ahead, you can justify the other 50% of your time spent on site. And you can help increase the efficiency of your journeyman. But not everyone wants to, or is capable of, doing that.",

Like working for the environment or biodiversity. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been applying to non profits and nature conservation firms etc. Some graduates are also doing urban or landscape planning.
