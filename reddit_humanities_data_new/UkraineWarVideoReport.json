            "I am constantly amazed at how Russia continues to fool the world into thinking they are a serious military power. They have 2 advantages. Their population and nuclear weapons. Putin said there were 700K soldiers currently deployed in Ukraine. So why are they not making no significant advances? They're using old weapons and equipment, which can't be replenished. Any helicopter or plane that is shot down cannot be replaced and the economy is slowly being paralyzed. It's Putin's utter disregard for his own people that keeps the country going, but they are nowhere near the military power they think they are. \n\nI'd give Zelensky everything he's asking for, and ten times more, and let Ukraine push them right back to the stone age.",

I know Russians in Russia who were called to the draft office, didn't come, stayed home and are now alive and unhurt.\n\nI have zero sympathy for people who came to Ukraine to kill and destroy whatever the reason. They may not be all rapists but they made their choice. If you jump into an active volcano you die, regardless of what kind of a person you were or what made you do it. The same applies to Ukraine. You come with a weapon in your hands you die. Unless you're smart enough to surrender through either the \"I want to live\" hotline or otherwise. If you got caught in the middle of your filthy act with your pants down, too bad, you die.",
            "Good thing you aren't running wars then you'd definitely fuck it up for sure bro\n\nSound like you'd collect some Geneva Convention violations honestly, given your unfamiliarity with what it actually says\n\nI'm certain you can find it in Russian somewhere tho\n\n\ud83d\udc4d",
            "You are just wrong and dug deep in the trench. \n\nWhen you see a soldier with no plates, no helmet, no weapon, retreating away from the front, it is because he is running to grab the plates, the helmet, the weapon, so he can return and kill you.\n\nYou have already been proven to that you were wrong on the \"legal side\" of this, now you are playing up the moral side and you are also wrong on that.\n\nImagine a scenario - A war ship is attacking a city. Then a kamikaze drone is approaching it. The second it flies close, all the team lift up their arms. Done, can't bomb them. The second it flies away, they all grab the weapons, shoot down the drone, continue shelling the city.\n\nThat is the point. Surrendering is the job of the one who surrenders. HE has to make sure that his surrender is valid. If you can not be captured, then you can not surrender. Simple as that. Raising your hands is not surrendering. Only accepting to be captured is surrender. \n\nBy your logic, sneak attacks are illegal - what if the person was in the middle of surrendering, he just did not know he is being watched so he couldn't display said surrender. \n\nAnd this whole \"what is the point of killing the enemy if he can not kill you at the moment\" is so pointless. What is the point of planting a bomb if a jeep that drives over it doesn't have anti-bomb armor? What is the point of throwing down a grenade if he can't throw up a grenade? What is the point of sniping someone if he doesn't have anti-snipe helmet?\n\nWhat is the point of destroying an enemy with means he can not defend against?",
            "I actually wonder how often you already did it. Trying to smidge in a bit of sympathy towards russians here, a bullshit lie there, telling people that \"well akshualleh\" Russia didn't invade Ukraine but they are just trying to establish their ~~diseased and decrepit~~ ancient and glorious ideology there so they can \"save\" the Ukrainians. It is so painfully obvious it makes my eyes bleed. Don't even bother answering.",
            ">He was unarmed, no protective equipment, and wounded.\n\nAnd if he returned to Russian lines he could have had his wound dressed, picked up a rifle and continued fighting.",
            "> He was unarmed, no protective equipment,\n\nThat Russian criminal started his day with weapon and equipment. That he willingly and deliberately threw them away in cowardice does not remove his culpability, nor does it prevent his well earned reward. Like so, just because a rapist jumps off his victim once the police sirens start wailing, does not mean he will not be punished.   \n\nThat Russian soldier, who you love more than his victims, would have returned the next day armed and armored, ready and eager to steal, murder, and rape. Every Russian soldier that dies today saves an innocent tomorrow.",
            "Your explanation is dumb af. Can't surrender  to a drone, but hey we can tell he's wounded so why not blow him up instead? So he's breaking contact, unarmed, and regroup where? Ah screw it, blownthem up anyways coz a drone can't tell the difference. Smart one dude.",
            "There is no love for russian soldiers where I live",
            "That's how civilized nations act. The japanese were hated amongst Americans for killing medics. Something even the Germans punished. \nEven the fucking Wehrmacht, the army fighting for a government that killed millions, realized that the wounded are not valid targets. \n\nThere are situations where it cannot be avoided, but THIS was not one. This was a warcrime on the same level of the ones the Russians commit when they kill our wounded, when they hit our medevac teams, when they she'll the corpses of our fallen.",
            "See this is what I mean. This is more assumptions. You don't know whether he volunteered or if he was drafted. Or if he was taken from a prison and stripped of his passport. \n\nYou don't know. \nNeither do I. \n\nYeah maybe he was the most evil shit in the world who murdered an entire village by burning them all alive after raping every single one of them. \n\nOr maybe he was just someone forced to do something he had no option to deny.\n\nMaybe the truth is somewhere in the middle. \n\nBut justifying his killing with reasons you do not know to be true, is just immoral",
            "Bro nobody speaks of surrendering. I'm talking about article 12 of the Geneva convention regarding the treatment of wounded combatants.\n\nAnd it's not the same as artillery. The drone operator made the decision to kill him. It's not just a fire mission on a transmitted grid point. \n\nYes sometimes these things happen, but when you can avoid becoming a war criminal you should do so.",
            "You can call BS all you want, I mean you could also just go to my account, where you'll see I do have videos of me in Ukraine with some of the toys we took from the Russians at the start of the war. Gotta scroll down a bit. \n\n\nIn any case I chose to keep my humanity by not treating people based on my assumptions of them.",
            "No idea how that would help, since my Russian skills are even less present than my Ukrainian language knowledge. But they are available in both english and German, which are the translations that I go by.",
            "Dosn't matter if you think it sounds stupid. That is how the laws of war work. Regroup where, with the rest of the Russian army. Being wounded means nothing. You don't know if he is unarmed he could have his pockets full of grenades.\n\nAnd it is on the individual who wants to surrender responsibility to ensure that the circumstances of their surrender is feasible and reasonable to the enemy. You cant just throw your weapon away on an active battlefield and yell \"i surrender\" and sit down. You cant expect the enemy to risk their own lives in the capture of you.\n\nIt is quite obvious that you know very little of the laws and rules of war.",
            "It doesn't sound like there's any love for russians anywhere anymore, regardless of who they are."

            "The first thing any breakaway region would want is international recognition and support. Which they should be offered on generous terms for giving up their nukes. All the regions that would break away from Moscow wouldn't have the economy to maintain them anyway, best they could do with them is sell them to terrorists if they don't get a better offer.",
            "New dictator, same old russia.\n\nThey can't function at all unless somebody is ruling them.",
            "They have had four real opportunities in history to become a legitimate country, and every time, the Russian people have chosen a despot. There is definitely something faulty in Russian culture.",

            "That's a valid point. I've been wondering if it's occurred to putin he will need our help once China annexes eastern russia.\n\nThere's no way russia will ever become free on their own volition. The russians need a strongman dictator to rule them with an iron fist.",
            "Why not both?  He just gave land to China.  When he dies in the chaos China could walk into the east with their massive army.  And take whatever they want.  Whatever is left of Russian military is in shambles.",

            "> It's plain to see that Russia is a country...\n\nA country that is formed by uniting by force different ethnic regions and dominating them from Moscow, when some region wants  independence Ruzzia bombs them to hell.  The statistics for minorities in Russia show a bigger decline then the Rusky .\n\nUK lost their colonies USSR lost only a few of them, Ruzzia'n empire will fall , would be ironic if Putin will be alive when this happen to see his good work in action.",
            "It is the Mongolian part of the russian culture. Mongols ruled over russia for over 200 years, and it shows. Without Mongols, russia would be like all the other Norsmen a.k.a. Scandinavian countries.",

            "It's more likely not the russians that need an iron-fist strongman rule, but the vast, underpopulated, poorly connected and badly maintained country of russia. Once that's broken up into more manageable pieces, there's a chance that russians could do OK with just a rubber fist sort of deal. Or not, we don't know, it hasn't been tried yet.",
            "Putin should stop the invasion before Russia's national security is compromised, the invasion is a gamble for Ukraine's resources, an investment, not currently a compromise to national security.",

            "It's true the unknown can be scarier than the Putin, especially since many of the good leaders are in labour camps, but a civil war could instil a better leader who knows the only way to work in this world is to cooperate with neighbors, not steal their toilets.",
            "I don't know man. I kinda wish they did and put a fucking leash on those cunts for few decades.",
            "No argument here, although I'm pretty sure he'll have a tragic window accident in russia before that can happen.",
            "I agree. There is no country named Russia. It is just a Federation ruled by russians. That is why the russians do not think in borders because they just do not have one because there is no Russia. \n\nPutler is afraid of loosing the great 1000 years of history so he wants to keep the way. Being agressive to others, break them down and take there land. And he thinks the free world would accept this? If he can keep ukrainian land than the russians will go further to the next war just to grab land. So it is time that this Federation breaks apart.",

            "It didn\u2019t it was just a concern that was voiced that never came to fruition.  Apparently there was some secret plan that in the event the nuclear sites in the USSR became unguarded during is collapse that block ops teams would fly in to secure them so terrorists couldn\u2019t raid them.  Since it didn\u2019t happen the plans were declassified eventually",
