            "Why can't we queue psycast anymore? Maybe it's just me and mod conflicts but can anyone else queue psycast in 1.5? Or am I missing something?",
            "Rimworld of Magic question:   \n  \nSo I got a chronomancer because their reverse time spell seemed OP as heck.  But I casted reverse time four times on someone with a demolished shoulder and it didn't clear up the problem.  The shoulder had just be screwed up in a skirmish where I captured them.  Does it only work on colonists?  Did I wait too late to cast it on them?  Does it just not work like it is supposed to?\n\nTheir age went down by a year or so but their screwed up shoulder never got healed.",
            "so I'm a bit new, and is it supposed to take 6+ days of time just to do fabricator research? I even have two research benches and they're both in a clean room, it's just all these researches that take 4000+ points take ages no matter what. even got that thing you attach to the tables for faster speed.",
            "I've played off and on for years now, but since Anomaly have been playing nonstop with my first two ever successful colonies. I'm playing without mods and have all of the DLCs installed.   \nEarly on in my second colony tribal raiders kidnapped a child. When this happened I got a popup that said that there /will/ be chances to retrieve this child.   \nYears have passed and her parents and sister still have her on their social tabs. They all have feelings about her (she's apparently disfigured now, which I have no clue how any of them know that), but she has a +0 to feelings about all of them. When I hover over her name, it doesn't say she's dead- only that she belongs to the tribe type that stole her.   \nI have never gotten any opportunity that I have noticed to save her.  I've been raiding and destroying their nearby colonies nonstop in an effort to find her.  \nIs there something I'm missing here? Should I be trying to befriend this group of heathens instead of grinding them into the ground? Have I somehow just not hit the colony she's currently staying in?  \nAny help on how to find her would be appreciated. I've been putting off trying to get an endgame sequence until she is retrieved, as a bit of RP. But if there's no way to get her back, I'll just have to move on.",
            "I might be going crazy but I seem to remember that way back in the day, areas were different for humans and animals. Is there a mod that brings that back? Or introduces it if it was never like that and I'm just making it up. \n\nI've got about 6 areas for humans, 6 different areas for mechs and 4 different areas for animals and having all of them at the same time is a bit much, especially since I never want to put humans in animal areas and so forth.",
            "First time playing with Anomaly what tips would you give me with out to much spoiler?",
            "Are there any known mod conflicts that cause animal training to fail to complete? The pawn starts training, works for the usual amount of time, then instead of it saying it succeeded or failed... nothing happens. They just walk away and the animal is still free to be trained again.\n\n\nThere's nothing in the logs indicating an error. It's like it just skips the last step.",
            "Is anyone else unable to jump multiple pawns with jump packs?",
            "Is it just me, or can repeatedly reloading saves impact performance? After a few loads, my system freezes and I have to restart.\u00a0I\u2019m not sure if this is a mod issue, a Steam Deck issue, or just a Rimworld issue.",
            "Hi!\n\nI've all the things except for Biotech and Anomaly. I know a lot about Biotech from watching YT playthroughs, and I've been meaning to buy it for at least a year.\n\nDoes Anomaly require Biotech?\n\nI should probably just buy Biotech before I jump into Anomaly, right?\n\nIs it reasonable to expect a DLC bundle on steam? I don't remember, but I think I bought Ideology+Royalty as a bundle. I could wait months for a Biotech+Anomaly combo.",
            "Is there a mod or some other way to find out what \"age\" each technology is attributed to? I am playing with a bunch of mods already and making this more transparent would be quite helpful.",
            "Im using Vanilla nutrient paste expanded mod,do you know what may cause the feeder to overflow?i frequently saw it go up to 100(which is the maximum stack i have currently) and spread out in adjacent tiles as well",
            "Hi There, I just started playing. I am wanting to know if anyone could suggest any youtube videos to watch to help learn. At this stage, my colony is going well but I need steel and I don't know how to make steel.",
            "Anyone know of a mod that allows smoke to either slow or put out fires?",
            "Is there a mod that lets you \"copy\" all the bionics you've put into colonist A to also put them in colonist B? Like, let's say I've given A 2 bionic arms, 2 bionic legs, etc ,etc I would like to just press one button and go \"okay, now put all of these in B, too\"",
            "It is possible to play the base game/DLC in a medieval way? In the sense that my colony is entirely tribal and can defend itself against all raids?\n\nIf not, what are the recommended mods? I dont want 300 mods installed if possible haha",
            "Is there a mod that makes creating xenogerms for non-baseliners less annoying? It seems like not only do I have to remember who comes with what genes, I also have to anticipate which genes overwrite which other gene. \n\nMost of the time I'm pretty close, but sometimes I'm off by 1-3 points which is mildly annoying until you start creating something with arcite genes.",
            "trying project rimfactory and my biggest gripe is that for some reason I cannot deconstruct the storage crates. Idk if infinite storage might be messing with them (pawns can't access infinite storage or the items don't \"count\" as being there if in any of the storage)",
            "Is cumulative overdoes counted per drug category or across all drugs? For example, if a pawn has all the drug dependency genes and happens to take one of each category of drugs for dependency at the same day, will he get cumulative overdoes?",
            "Is there a way to adjust the frequency with which certain (vanilla) races appear? I understand that you see more Impids/Wasters/Ytakkin because they can be raiders, but I play this game all the time and I honestly can't remember the last time I saw a genie or a highmate as anything other than a purchasable slave from a trader. Of the many, many random visitors or colony joiners over the last few real life weeks I cannot think of a single example of a highmate. It just kind of feels like they're not there",
            "Is there a mod that makes battle mechs behave more like battle animals? Meaning I don't have to micro all of them by individually drafting them, I just want one button I can hit to \"send it\" and then let them do their thing. With regular \"escord\" mode they stay too close to my mechboy but I'm too lazy to tell my 15 scythers what to do. I just want to control my 4 guys with flame throwers, set everyone on fire and have my scythers scythe through the medium rare raiders.",
            "No it's not just you. I notice that too.",
            "I'm not sure I've tried that on missing limbs.\n\nBut the wiki says \"This can remove many ailments that were caused recently as the tissue is restored to a state prior to the ailment; this includes wounds, diseases, and age related ailments that occurred within the window of time reversal.\"\n\nMaybe lost limbs are not included?\n\nAlthough it also says\" Upgrades affect the power of Reverse Time - increasing the effect on equipment, corpses, and pawns - decrease mana cost, and allow to raise the dead, though it will put both pawns into a coma.\"\n\nSo maybe a higher level would work?\n\nI would have to try on dev mode to see what happens.",
            "Yea. research takes time. How fast you are depends on your pawns as much as the room. One thing that can happen is that you give pawns too many jobs and since research is way on the right of the task list, your guys never get to it.\n\nPersonally, I never really worry about research. I start as a tribal so I just deal with it. My technology is a stick that is pointy on one end (that end goes into the bad guys). The only new things we learn in the first year is \"pants\" and if we're feelings spicy, we also discover \"beds\".\n\nThe more you play the more you'll see that you don't really need a lot of research, though, and that will make it go faster in a sense because you're not researching things you don't really need. You also need to keep in mind that research in itself is pointless. If you can't afford to build the thing you researched or if you don't have enough people to use it, you don't really have the thing.",
            "If you're like me and playing anomaly start, you get a reduction in research speed. I kinda like it, as most playthroughs I can't keep up with building the new stuff before  an even newer thing gets researched.",
            "The only way to get back kidnapped pawns is to wait for an extremely-rare quest to rescue them. No guarantee that such a quest will ever appear. They don't appear in enemy colonies or anything. It's very unkind to players. There's probably a mod that makes it easier.\n\nedit: actually I'm not sure if that's true: someone else did say that they pop up as part of the enemy faction as well, which would mean tearing through enemy colonies would have a chance of finding them as a raider.\n\n>Have I somehow just not hit the colony she's currently staying in?\n\nthis isn't something rimworld does; it generates the list of pawns you're fighting on-the-spot, location doesn't matter.",
            "I banished a pawn recently. Using skip abduction ritual, they sometimes get abducted. Perhaps you could try the same.",
            "You may find [this](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2316018203) helpful, but alas it may not work in 1.5.\n\nI still play on 1.4 myself, so I can use all of these cool older mods.",
            "Don't google things. :D Honestly I don't think there is a lot you need to know. Anomaly is definitely one that you should go in blind and just roll with it. If something seems weird don't just run the other way, poke it with a stick.",
            "Wall your base (:",
            "Read a lot of the pop ups and hover over various numbers to see details. Some things may not work exactly as you expect. Figuring out how some things work can be very advantageous.",
            "Halvars is right, Wall your base. Even more important than the base game.\n\nOther tips:\n* If you typically go with small colonies (like 6 or less), you might want to expand more than you usually do.\n* Don't neglect studying the entities\n* Incinerators are fun, effective (not on mechs) and can be used with shield belts.\n* Ghouls.",
            "I've never encountered this one, but it sounds like a weird mod conflict that would have to be carefully debugged by removing mods in batches. If there's a tame animal utility in debug mode or God mode I would use that to test it.",
            "I haven't had that happen, but repeatedly loading saves is one way memory leaks show up.  It could be mods or the Steam Deck, but mods are probably more likely, so you could try disabling mods to see if it goes away, and narrow down which one is causing it.",
            "All I know is deleting 100 saves down to 5 or so greatly speeds up load time.\n\nAlso, the saves themselves are pretty big, circa 40mb each.",
            "I wouldn't hold my breath for steam sales. Tynan has always said he priced the game fairly and doesn't think it needs deep discounts and I would definintely agree with that. You'd be hard pressed to find better value for money than rimworld.\n\nPersonally, I would 100% recommend biotech. It adds a lot of cool things. \n\nWhile I like anomaly, there \"problem\" with that one is that a lot of the appeal is in the mystery and once you've seen what it adds once that obviously isn't there any more. I still like it and it certainly also adds things I will use every playthrough but it's definitely behind biotech.",
            "Just in case your original question wasn't fully answered: none of the DLCs require another DLC to function. Some of them have small amounts of interoperability content that is only enabled if two DLCs are active (such as the Bloodfeeder meme for Ideology which is only enabled if Biotech is installed), but all of them are capable of functioning independently.",
            "Anomaly and biotech are basically totally separate. Neither one would require the other, and what they add doesn't interact that much in my opinion. Biotech in a nutshell is mechs, kids, and gene stuff. Anomaly in a nutshell is for a horror themed run where you totally change the feel of the game towards that content.\u00a0\n\n\nBoth are good and which one you get totally depends on what you're interested in. I feel comfortable saying most people would recommend biotech. It adds a lot of content that fits in neatly with the base game. I personally would probably do Anomaly first instead, but very much a personal preference",

            "Steel is a rock/ore you mine from rock formations on your map. You click on it, then select the option to mark it for mining, and then a pawn with a work priority for mining will do it.\n\n\nIn terms of videos I would suggest just searching like \"beginners guide to rimworld\" and watch a couple hours of the most popular ones in the meantime.",
            "It's not impossible to fight mechanoid clusters using medieval tech, but it is *extremely difficult* to the extent that most folk wouldn't really enjoy the process. You'd have to deliberately choose not to use more advanced tech, or at the very least never build or research advanced tech, but weapons rapidly advance just from dropped items.\n\n* My Preference: Vanilla Factions Expanded - Medieval, hasn't been updated to 1.5\n\n* The lowest overhead overhaul is probably to install \"Medieval Vanilla\" which just cuts out everything of advanced tech, adding nothing. This makes it inherently incompatible with most Royalty and Biotech content, but at least keeps the storyteller from dropping pods in your castle.\n\n* The *highest* overhead overhaul is \"Medieval Overhaul\", which radically alters the game, but is extremely popular and far more content rich/heavy than the others. The version on Steam hasn't been updated to 1.5 yet, but my understanding is that there is a stable test version in available in their Discord. This one in particular changes the game a bit too much for me personally, but may be exactly what you're looking for if you want like a new game experience more centered around a specific period, it really does a lot of work to flesh it out.\n\n\nThere are also some cosmetic mods (like Dark Ages: Crypts and Tombs) that can really help sell the medieval experience.",
            "[More Gene Information](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2942759212)\n\nFrom the mod\u2019s description:\n> When designing xenogerms, select the pawn to apply it to, and see the pawn's endogenes, the resulting metabolic efficiency, and what endogenes will be overwritten.",

            "It might be more accurate to say that Yttakin/Neanderthals are more common because they have dedicated fractions that can raid you, while Highmates and Genies do not \n\nIf you wanna fish for pawns that  can be incapable of violence (Like highmates or Kickstarter pawns with forced incapability for violence), your best bet is often to farm ancient dangers.\n\nOtherwise yes, the only time you're going to get one is if a slaver passes through or if a joint event rolls the vanishingly unlikely shot at it being a specific xenotype.",
            "Genies you can get from raids, just make sure you have a psychic shock lance ready to go. If you get the \"numbers\" mod you can quickly look up xenotype what the raiders are and with \"mark that pawn\" you can put a little icon over him so you don't lose him in the herd.\n\nHighmates are difficult because they are non violent. Look for them in events. I also got one from skip abduction. Look up what the population limits are for the storyteller you are using and stay under that until you have your highmate.",
            ">The more you play the more you'll see that you don't really need a lot of research, though, and that will make it go faster in a sense because you're not researching things you don't really need.\n\nthat's good to know, because I was really getting intimidated by the fact there was like 100 other things that would take just as long as fabrication research, meaning 6 x 100 = 600 days of nonstop research lol.",
            "Thank you for the help!",
            "Yea, I've seen that. Doesn't really do what I need, I think and I've already upgraded to 1.5 after sticking to 1.2 forever :D",
            "I like the idea of poking it with a stick \ud83d\ude02",
            "I agree that the game is priced fairly. There's a stupid amount of content and mechanics in just the base game alone, and then you have the DLCs that are basically base games in themselves.\n\nThat said, I've all the DLCs for Vampire Survivors for a fraction of the cost of my RW purchases. But VS is a game I have 3000+ hours in, so it's not a good comparison. If I had similar hours in RW, not buying all the things would just be stupid.\n\nI think my plan will be to buy Biotech now, play around with it for a few months, and then pick up Anomaly.",
            "Royalty and ideology sounded kinda stupid, even as a veteran player. And a bit pricey.  \nLooking back, it was money well spent.",
            "Thank you, I was still kind of left hanging on that one.",
            "Agreed. Biotech adds a lot of fun stuff. Anomaly is fun after a couple of playthroughs.\n\nThere's a nice synergy between biotech \"requires age reversal\" which is a time consuming pain in the butt, and chronophagy , which obviates the need for the former.",

            "Good plan. I've been starting a new playthrough for every DLC, trying to maximise new content and win conditions.\n\nArchonexus was less tedious than I thought. Though it was hard to choose between first gen colonists and their well educated, colony raised kids. I chose the kids, who inherited their parents archotech arms and legs and eyes."

            "To answer your question\n\nFrom my perspective you sound bothered so ill reply accordingly to how i perceive your comment\n\n\n1st\nWhy does my comment bother you so much that you have the need to comment on it \ud83e\udd23\nmost would ignore it and move on and yes i know i am replying to you but still\n\nSo why did you?\n\n2nd and most important \n(hopefully we learned something here)\n\nTo see who it would take the bait \ud83e\udd23\n(honestly didn\u2019t think it would be you)\n\nThank you for being number 1 much love \ud83e\udef6\u2764\ufe0f",
            "Nice, been a while I dont play, looks like the mod is no longer needed",
            "alright, i finally got around to double checking how these things work\n\nhidden wires do seem to be indestructible\n\nyou've convinced me, you are right",
            "Nope, it's random. The explosion does scale off based on your stored power though. Makes using a lot of batteries back in 1.4 very scary.",
            "The size of the zzzt scales depending on connected stored energy, but the frequency doesn't. \n\nSo if you have a zzzt prone grid, it is good to make modular storage. I normally have sets of 2 batteries that can each be isolated with a switch, so I can store 6 batteries of energy while only having 2 connected at a time.",
            "Honestly sometimes zzt events make sense, steel isn't the best material for wiring and these people who made these batteries were tribals 2 weeks ago. Something gotta go wrong.",
            "Same for bullshit solar EMPs by the way!",
            "There's a lot of little qol mods that really help. Common Sense (i think that's what it's called) makes it so pawns will clean an area before cooking or doing surgery, reducing the chance of disease as a result. Run n gun is exactly what it says on the tin. Idr the name, but there's an expanded work tab mod that i refuse to play without.",

Mechanoids attacked it while destroying a little building I made to house some deep drills.",

            "Anecdotal evidence, but I did have a Diabolus' charge attack destroy a piece of hidden conduit. I think hidden conduit is immune to most forms of damage. I think explosions might be the exception. I never actually tested further though.",
            "single wire fault discharging your entire battery bank is... fucking silly.",
            "I wouldn't have any problem with EMPs if there was an actual vanilla workaround. I am aware of the mod, but I'd want something more like having to individually insulate each device somehow. The mod is OP for not too much cost, I think.",

            "possibly just vaporize if thats the case\n\ni just ran a series of tests by detonating things on top of the cables",
            "Nah.\n\nThere's probably no fuse in that system so the short just goes straight into the ground. The batteries completely discharging is the good outcome.\n\nThe bad one is them catching fire or exploding cause they overheated.",

            "Almost like the game was designed without electricity realism in mind.\n\nNote that there's no maintenance or anything you can do to prevent it. Your wiring exploding and filling a room with fire is inevitable, and can happen multiple times a year.",
            "yeah I remember as a kid shorting an outlet and it totally shut down power to the entire block and discharged everything we owned connected to the grid.... oh wait.... that's not how it works in real life.",

            "It's an abstraction like all things in games lol. If you want a more in-depth power management experience that you can crisis-proof there's games like Oxygen not Included, you just have to deal with dupes instead of pawns, and having played both games pawns are (generally) less likely to die to their own stupidity. Almost everything in Rimworld is RNG, by choice because it's a random story generator.",
            "To be fair real life wiring had a habit of causing horrible electrical fires for quite some time after its invention",
            "What maintenance are you supposed to do on power conduit. In real life you pull wire through conduit and if there's a nicked wire you won't know until it pops. Not a whole lot of maintenance you could do other than replace stuff every few years but not really necessary. Just for conduit at least",
            "A discharge will completely drain batteries not a powered grid. Not sure why you commented one thing then replied with OE from something COMPLETELY different",
            "I work in the production of data centers and the 6v batteries we use are extremely dangerous because they discharge at 13.2kv in one big boom",
            "I do be having dupes going to have their lunch break in my carbon dioxide room tho, kinda wild sometimes",
            "That is why you use a circuit breaker. Should the conduit short circuit because of damage, it will be disconnected before it can cause further damage, like fires.",
            ">What maintenance are you supposed to do on power conduit.\n\nI don't know specifically, why don't you ask the guys in the cherry pickers doing maintenance on electric poles around town?",
            "Most batteries will either:\n\n\\* Have high internal resistance (e.g. alkaline) that prevent them from discharging quickly into a short. The outcome is a dead battery rather than an explosion.\n\n\\* Have active battery protection electronics (most lithium ion or other low internal resistance batteries) that detect and shut off if they detect a short or overcurrent condition. Output electronics will usually also have fuses in case that fails, too.\n\nFor a high capacity gridlike application like batteries in Rimworld I would expect them to fall into the latter category. This is particularly true since batteries don't have a constant voltage as they're discharged and even for DC loads will usually require buck or boost converters to supply a constant output voltage. I would expect such converters to have both short circuit and overcurrent protection, and would also expect an undetected short condition to damage the converter along with the wiring.",
            "I ended up deleting the comment shortly after posting when I started thinking about what kinds of batteries a rimworld would likely build, but apparently not quick enough.\n\nAfter more consideration, they'd probably be building something like lead-acid batteries because of how little manufacturing base is needed to produce them, and there are few battery types better at rapidly discharging themselves than lead-acid batteries."
