It's an award-winning, French-Canadian coming-of-age vampire film that's been charming audiences at festivals worldwide, including TIFF and Venice, and has won numerous awards. It's hitting theaters nationwide this week. I'm here to answer all your questions about the film, my journey, and anything else you're curious about! AMA!\n\n**Logline:**  \nSasha is a young vampire with a very serious problem: she\u2019s too sensitive to kill! Frustrated by their daughter\u2019s empathy for humans, Sasha\u2019s parents decide to cut off her blood supply to force her to learn how to hunt\u2026 or starve! Just as she decides to reject her vampire instincts and embrace a final death, she meets a lonely teenager named Paul who is willing to give his life to save hers, on the condition that she help fulfill his final wishes before day breaks.\n\n**Watch the Trailer:**  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6Ox75fXY7o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6Ox75fXY7o)\n\n**Release Date:**  \nHumanist Vampire opens in NY and LA theaters today, followed by a nationwide theatrical rollout!\n\n**Edit: I\u2019m logging off now to get ready for the film\u2019s NYC premiere!

            "Ariane will be answering questions an hour or two after this post goes live (so around 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM Eastern). Please ask away :)",
            "This movie looks fantastic, can't wait to see it!\n\nWe've been watching and reading vampire stories for centuries now, why do you personally think that the concept has such staying power with audiences?\n\nAlso, were there any established vampire \"tropes\" that you were consciously avoiding when making the film? Any specific ones you wanted to honor/homage with the film?",
            "Allo Ariane!\n\nI absolutely loved the movie at TIFF last year, one of my favorites of the festivals. It was super charming/bloody/sweet/hilarious. A really unique mix. Looking forward to catching it again soon for its full release, hopefully in a theater.\n\nThere's one scene in particular that I really loved and couldn't stop thinking about, when Sasha and Paul are listening to the music together that reminded me so much of the [Listening Booth Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkRuHhhYAqg&ab_channel=VivekYadav) from **Before Sunrise**, one of my all-time favorite scenes. Was this intended? I've been hoping it was lol.\n\nIf not, were there other films that you used as influences for **Humanist Vampire**?",
            "Hello!\n\nWhat are some of your most favorite coming of age films? And what about them stands out to you?",
            "Ariane! I loved HVSCSP!! It was so much fun and a superb joy to watch! Feel free to answer 0-all of these:\n\n1. How did the idea/subject matter come about for the film?\n2. How did you convince your producers to keep the super long title (that's surprisingly shorter in French!)\n3. What sold you about Sara and Felix-Antoine during the casting process that they would be PERFECT for their roles?\n4. What did you find most fun and most challenging in making your first feature?\n5. Are you related to French royalty?!\n\nP.S. I loved the set design of the cousin's place! Kudos to the designer(s)!\n\nCongrats on all the award wins and nominations for your debut feature!!",
            "What's your favourite vampire movie/s if you have any?",
            "Humanist Vampire was a lot of fun!  \n  \nAre you working on anything at the moment? Any plans for your next feature?",
            "Who are your favourite directors? Who inspired you to be a director?",
            "Was Armin Meiwes, the German cannibal who only wanted consenting victims, part of the inspiration?",
            "Congrats on making one of the most beautiful films I\u2019ve seen in a while! Can you tell me a bit about how you developed your vision for the film\u2019s cinematography? Your cinematographer has a new fan in me!",
            "Je n\u2019ai pas vraiment de question autre que de te f\u00e9liciter pour le film! Je te souhaite le meilleur des succ\u00e8s!",
            "Hello, *Humanist Vampire* was one of the best films I saw last year and I loved how you managed to unpacked a hilariously ironic/absurd premise to its fullest implications with so much heart. During my viewing, what struck me the most was how Sasha's story works so, so well as a metaphor or allegory for so many situations--from the obvious (like ethical debates about eating meat) to the abstract (e.g. coming out of the closet)--that it made your film feel at once intimate and universal. Thank you for this all-Canadian gem!\n\nCan you elaborate a bit more on the writing process for *Humanist Vampire*, and how you brought it from initial idea to final script? Were there any ideas or scenes that had to be cut that you wish could've made their way to the final product? Did you have any particular themes or motifs in mind that guided your story development?",
            "I don't have any questions, but fellow Canadian here who got to see this a while back on Crave (twice because I liked it so much, I watched it again right away).  This movie was an absolute delight, an awkward outsider coming of age / meet cute with a slightly dark twisty angle.  And also a fresh take on vampires as well with some unique lore!  I've been talking it up to everyone I know.  It's currently sitting in my top ten of ranked list of Vampire films in my Letterboxd so you done good in my books! We don't get a lot of Canadian Vampire movies so I was excited and appreciative of your entry to the genre.\n\n(PS I'm also learning French - thought this would be a fun one to practice with and it was!  It was really accessible for a language learner).",
            "Just FWIW, absolutely LOVE this film, now desperately hoping it gets (amongst a wider distribution and appreciation) UK theatrical distribution and broader pickup/distribution so that I can get a physical copy of it on Blu Ray domestically; the import fees from Canada or Australia (weirdly) just astronomical!",
            "Hello! Thanks for doing this AMA with us.\n\nWhat's your dream project? And which actor do you want to work with the most?",
            "Okay wait to be so real with you I\u2019ve never been a fan of vampire movies but after reading just the description I think it sounds fantastic! Definitely worth a watch I think",
            "Sara Montpetit seemed like the perfect casting for a teenage vampire! What went into that casting decision and what would be some projects you'd like to collaborate on together in the future?",
            "[removed]",
            "I just want to say, I saw this earlier this year at the Lightbox and loved it. Can\u2019t wait to see what you work on next!",
            "Wow I saw the trailer months ago and thought it looked fantastic!  I don\u2019t even like Vampire films but this just seemed so compelling and well done.  Will definitely be projecting it in my own personal screening room.  My GF is an actress from Transylvania, so I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll enjoy it as well.\n\nPerhaps you can tell us how you got it produced?",
            "I was at the world premiere screening at TIFF, I saw it again at CIFF/ Eau Claire. Congrats!",
            "Hi, could you tell me a bit more about the movie? \n\nE.g. plot, characters, cast",
            "Hey! Thank you so much! To answer your first question, I think the world of vampires is an incredible playground to discuss our relationship with death, others, and the society we live in. Vampires are fascinating because they are both attractive and dangerous, and personally, I love playing in areas where attraction and repulsion meet. I also love misfits. The vampire story always evolves because the society around us evolves.\n\nFor your second question, the only vampire trope that I decided to change is that my vampires age! They age more slowly than humans, but I really wanted the character of Shasha to experience childhood to establish her childhood trauma.",
            "Hey! Thank you for your question and your kind words! I'm sorry to disappoint you, but no, it wasn't a reference to *Before Sunrise*, which I agree is a brilliant film! It is the scene that I am most proud of in my film though. The films that have influenced me the most in making my movie are *A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night*, *Only Lovers Left Alive*, and *Under the Skin*!",
            "My favorite coming-of-age films that come to mind are: *Juno*, *Garden State*, *Little Miss Sunshine*, and *Harold and Maude*. These are films I watched when I was a teenager, and as a little weirdo myself, I related to those characters because they are weird, surprising, vulnerable, and so lovable. More recently, I love *How to Have Sex* and *Bottoms*, obviously for very different reasons! *How to Have Sex* is a brilliant and important film about rape culture, and *Bottoms* is just a joy to watch with the most amazing cast!",
            "I\u2019m running out of time to answer everyone, so I\u2019ll pick two of your questions: \n\n3.What sold me on Sara and F\u00e9lix-Antoine:\n\nI was sold on both of them individually pretty early on in the casting process, as you can imagine! But what remained to be confirmed was their chemistry together. \n\nThe final step of the process was to have them act out one of the scenes together (the \u201cEmotions\u201d scene!). It was so beautifully awkward - they had both come very prepared, but had approached the scene so differently, that it created a lot of clumsy, awkward moments - which is exactly what I wanted! Funny enough, both actors thought they completely bombed the audition, but I begged to differ :) \n\n[5.Am](http://5.Am) I related to French royalty: \n\nAbsolutely not! In fact, when I travel to France, people get a good laugh out of my surname, which has long disappeared over there but is still somewhat prevalent in Quebec!",
            "My favorite vampire films are *The Hunger*, *A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night*, and *Only Lovers Left Alive*. I also want to add *Under the Skin-*it's not a vampire film, but it inspired me a lot during my creative process.",
            "Thanks for watching!\n\nI\u2019m working on too many things! I have another feature I\u2019m developing in French, an adaptation of a play by a wonderful playwright named Rebecca Deraspe. In the US, I\u2019ve got a few things in the works, including my first English language feature, which is a complete departure from the universe of Humanist Vampire! I also see some TV in my future\u2026 stay tuned!",
            "I'm a big David Lynch and Jane Campion fan! *Mulholland Drive* is the film that made me fall in love with cinema as an art form. It's a challenging film, but it is so unique. I love dreamlike worlds and the combination of tension, emotional scenes, dark humor, and colorful, odd characters. My favorite film by Jane Campion is *Sweetie*, her first feature, which has such a distinctive tone and deeply moving characters!",
            "Great question! No, he wasn\u2019t, actually. I didn\u2019t know about him until after the film was released and people started asking me this very question!",
            "Ohhhh, thank you so much! :) I'll pass your kind words to Shawn Pavlin, the cinematographer! I've been working with him since my first short film, so we have great chemistry and have really developed our visual aesthetic together through all of our projects. Before starting this specific project, we watched a bunch of vampire films to spark our inspiration.",
            "Cheers for the kind words :)",
            "Argh, I\u2019m sorry! I don\u2019t have an answer for you right now but I\u2019m forwarding your question to people who might!",
            "Ouuuhhhh, my dream project! That's a tough one! I think my dream project would be to make a very wild musical! And there are so many actors I want to work with! It's impossible to choose just one, but let's say: Mark Ruffalo and Ayo Edebiri!",
            "I love reading that!\u00a0\u00a0I really set out to make a vampire film that would appeal to a broader audience than just vampire fans!\u00a0\u00a0In my humble opinion, I think fans of many different genres will be able to relate to Sacha and Paul\u2019s humanity (so to speak!) and their quest for meaning. The film also borrows a lot of other universes - coming of age and dark comedy being two of them. \n\nI hope you enjoy it!",
            "I agree with you, she was perfect for this role! I was already a fan of hers and had especially enjoyed watching her in Charlotte Le Bon\u2019s FALCON LAKE, and I thought she had such a beautiful, mysteriously vampiric aura to her! It was a very easy casting decision! \n\nAs for future collaboration with Sara, while there\u2019s nothing concrete right now,\u00a0\u00a0I can\u2019t wait to find an opportunity to work with her again, and something tells me it won\u2019t take too long before that happens!",
            "<3",
            "If you\u2019re in NYC or LA, go see it in theatres, and go in blind!\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019ll be more fun that way!\n\nIf you\u2019re elsewhere in the US, there\u2019s a wider release coming. I hope you enjoy it :)",
            "Did anyone ask you whether [the episode of *The IT Crowd*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOE-q20RcDM) was an inspiration?",
            "I was genuinely not expecting an acknowledgement or response. Wow. Thank you so much (just for the response!) and very best with the films continued success.",
            "That's exciting! Can't wait to see more from you both!",
            "Never!",
            "Thank you <3"

        "content": "Let me preface this by saying that I love Christopher Nolan. To me, he's one of the best directors/movie makers, and up until recently, I considered him my #1. Until Dunkirk. It was his first movie after Interstellar, which was (again, in my opinion) a masterpiece. I remember seeing it in IMAX 70mm and had the most unexplainable movie experience of my life. I was silently sobbing by the end of it.\n\nAnd that was after Inception and Dark Knight! So when Dunkirk came out, I had very high expectations, because his films always met those expectations and surpassed them. I remember noticing that his brother wasn't a part of writing it, but I didn't pay much attention to that fact... until I saw the film. Honestly, I considered it a disappointment. It was nothing like his last few movies before it, and it barely impacted me. I thought it was lacking some kind of magic that his films always had. \n\nI was happier with Tenet, and I think that the concept and a lot of the scenes were absolutely amazing! But, again, something about the film was lacking to me. It just didn't hit its mark. It wasn't what I had come to expect from Nolan's films. It didn't have the same heart and execution in its story, and I felt that missing from most scenes. Robert Pattinson was the best part of the movie for me because it's like he got it and he gave it. \n\nThat's when I started to realize that Jonathan Nolan was what was missing. I was giving all the credit to Christopher by considering him my #1 and thinking of Jonathan as only 'helping' him with the scripts. I may be wrong, but I think he was integral to the masterpieces that the films were when they were making them together.\n\nOppenheimer was obviously a fantastic movie, but to me, it was still missing the magic that I'd come to expect from Christpher Nolan. I don't know how else to explain it. There used to be this kind of electricity, heart, and soul. I'm not saying that I think those things were missing entirely, obviously not! Just that I think they were incomplete, and I think it's because he's been making his films without Jonathan for a decade now.\n\nThe writing of Westworld season 1 was like the TV version of what I was missing after Interstellar, especially the writing. I think that Christopher is a master director/filmmaker. But I think he writes great films, not masterpieces. Jonathan IS that missing piece. \n\nI'm not exactly sure why they parted ways, but I hope that they plan to make more films together in the future.\n\nEdit to add: I think that Christopher Nolan fans fall into 2 categories. Those who prefer his films pre-2014 and those who prefer his films post 2014. I want to emphasize that I'm not saying that one side is right or wrong. Just my own opinions. Cinema is about personal preference after all. \n\nEdit again to add: Welp, I don't know how I missed that Chrisophet Nolan wrote all of Inception, which I consider a masterpiece.",

            "Christopher is very cold and clinical. I think his brother kind of lightens up some of those movies. I will say Oppenheimer was pretty great, and the most I\u2019ve enjoyed his movies since they stopped working together.",
            "I'm shocked that there is no mention (at tine of writing) of The Prestige.\n\nTalking about the most incredible writing, the exceptional heart and emotion inherent, the incredible rush of insight in the third act.\n\nThe amazing opening monologue that tells you everything you need to know.\n\nJonathan Nolan's masterpiece.",
            "I have been trying to figure out why I have felt this exact way since after Interstellar. Thank you for this.",
            "Hard agree. I actually didn't know that about the brother's influence. Like you, I thought Dunkirk, Tenet and Oppenheimer were all great films in a technical sense and intellectually but they lacked character stuff. Especially Tenet was let down by the (lack of meaningful) relationships between the characters, which was a shame because it had such an interesting take on time travel (sorry I mean reverse entropy lol). It's like the director spent 10 years on the concept and 10 minutes on whatever role Elizabeth Debicki's character was supposed to play (did you know she was a mother, did you know she saw everything through the lens of her child?)",
            "Strongly recommend the show Person of Interest if you like sci-fi. It was Johnathan Nolan's first series and it is all-time excellent in my opinion. It was overlooked since it was a CBS procedural show, but it does a great job with its overarching story and the last two seasons dive head-first into that arc mostly without the procedural format. \n\nIf you're in the U.S. it's free to watch with ads on Freevee.",
            "Is there a reason why they stopped working together??",
            "He is still my favorite director but I agree the movies with his brother just hit a little different.",
            "Didn't someone already do this about a week ago? I'm almost certain of it.",
            "I do know what you mean and I don\u2019t know if it is just Johnathan absence but it could be someone who is able to challenge Christopher\u2019s vision and he will listen to them.  You can see Christopher vision when it comes to his films and he is a master at his craft.  But being to enhance something without disrupting is not always simple.",
            ">I think that Christopher Nolan fans fall into 2 categories. Those who prefer his films pre-2014 and those who prefer his films post 2014.\n\nBadum tss. I've felt this for so long. Glad someone else noticed it too. Each are whole different eras of Christopher Nolan kino",
            "His movies are so fn noisy now. Constant talking with music crushing your eardrums. Not subtle at all",
            "I agree with everything you said except Oppenheimer. That was a truly fantastic film I'd say as good as interstellar but totally different genre and feel but I'd say it's a masterpiece\u00a0",
            "I agree, I don't think it's a coincidence that I didn't enjoy his 3 latest films as much as those before.",
            "I don\u2019t think I can agree with this one. I think you\u2019re onto something that the earlier films were more character driven and there was lots of quality to be found there, but if we\u2019re hyping up Jonathan\u2019s contribution to the writing, we have to also hold him accountable for the writing shortfalls, and there are plenty. I\u2019m not saying Chris Nolan isn\u2019t a genius film maker, but each of his masterpieces is flawed in some way, and all of those ways involve the writing. The over-exposition, missed opportunities and multiple magic beans of Inception is a good example. (Still a great movie in many ways)\n\nAs for Jonathan\u2019s other work (Lisa Joy, too), on one hand I watched Westworld fly off the tracks and the other hand, they seem to be nailing Fallout. \n\nI value both brothers as creators, but it seems both have consistent weak spots in their work.",
            ">I was happier with Tenet\n\nMade me doubt on being dissapointed with Dunkirk, but absolutely lost me there.",
            "He directed Fallout series. He's making his own legend.",
            "I don\u2019t fall into either category because I personally think his crime films that happen to star Batman are his weakest offerings by far.\n\nI think the real issue is his schtick is running out.  There\u2019s only so many ways to appear smarter than other people before you\u2019re just repeating yourself or rambling incoherently.  Actors have said they don\u2019t understand his scripts, and before Oppenheimer came out I told my SO and child that it\u2019s going to be a non-linear film because he doesn\u2019t like stories told in order.  Even Dunkirk had that.  It\u2019s a war movie told out of order\u2026like what\u2026",
            "I think, Christopher's writing wants you to watch what has been made. On the other hand, Jonathan's writing makes you want to watch what has been made. If that makes any sense.\n\nI myself realized this after watching Fallout. Jonathan knows how to connect with audience better than Christopher.",
            "Dunkirk and Oppenheimer are both perfect films imo. I hope Nolan makes more historical films. In both he managed to capture the incredible weight and meaning behind those events. Never seen another director pull that off to that extent.",
            "Dunkirk & Oppenheimer make a mean WW2 double-feature. Probably my two faves from Nolan.",
            "I think I agree, but I also think it\u2019s ironic because I think Jonathan and Lisa\u2019s stuff is really lacking something. After the first Westworld season, the later seasons all kind of fell apart under the weight of their own cleverness and self-seriousness. Peripheral was similar in that it was really compelling at first and then the season finale was so disappointing to me that I had no interest in the next season and didn\u2019t care when it was canceled. And we got bored with Fallout somewhere around episode 4. Maybe the thing his stuff is missing is Christopher, maybe they need each other.",
            "I literally said the same thing to my wife a couple of years ago.\n\nJonathan brought the heart to the projects,  without it it feels very good technically  but empty.\n\nDunkirk and Tenet are great examples.\n\nBoth are great technically but tell me the name of 1 character..... and for tenet it's actually worse , the protagonist  is\n.. protagonist. \n\nStill love Nolan but I really hope he does another movie with his brother  writing.",
            "Love Nolan. Past two movies have fallen below his standards in my opinion. I was disappointed in Oppenheimer because that story is far more interesting than the movie. I read an American Prometheus a few years before and in my opinion the story fell is bit short.\u00a0\nI totally understand that\u2019s not everyone\u2019s opinion though.",
            "Wow. Dunkirk is a masterpiece. It\u2019s amazing story telling.\u00a0",
            "I disagree about Dunkirk. It\u2019s one of hist best movies.  \n\nI really wanted to like Tenant, but I wasn\u2019t convinced that Branagh\u2019s character was a mastermind and the threat wasn\u2019t very clear. \n\nI do enjoy the sense of wonder from his science fiction movies though and his use of mind bending special effects, so I understand what you mean. \n\nI would love to see him do a Robopocalypse movie.",
            "Tenet was a turd but I don\u2019t get how anyone can hate on Dunkirk. It is a masterpiece.",
            "Absolutely agree. It pisses me off that they don\u2019t work together because when they do, they make MAGIC. Without Jonathan i haven\u2019t liked anything Nolan has made. Not even a little.",
            "I agree, those films definitely were less impressive/enjoyable for me. Oppenheimer was super overrated imo in particular, don\u2019t feel chopping up the timeline really served the film, and the actual explosion in the nuke scene was entirely underwhelming visually, though that was still a great scene overall. \n\nThose films all just didn\u2019t really catch me like his other work has, perhaps his brother is why that is, not sure.",
            "Dunkirk is a fantastic movie. One of, if not his best l. Interstellar was half of an interesting movie with some great ideas. Tenet was absolute crap. Idk how you can look at Dunkirk and claim it's anything but phenomenal or use it as evidence of his downfall..",
            "Agreed but have you seen fallout? Never played the games but Jonathan nailed it. Some of the best, most immersive sci fi I\u2019ve seen in recent memory.\u00a0",
            "People need to realize when Christopher directs a movie without his brother involved, he's the *sole* director and writer usually. Jonathan's TV stuff is done with multiple writers",
            "Wasn't Jonathan Nolan the one who really wanted Catwoman aka Selina Kyle to be in Dark Knight Rises? Not complaining, but I can see why Jonathan needs to be there.\u00a0",
            "His only movies I consider incredible are both Oppenheimer and Dunkirk. \u00a0I think Dunkirk is incomparable and genuinely a 10/10. Hope he continues without him",
            "Genuinely surprised by how many people in here think Dunkirk is his masterpiece. I found it to be a pretty by the books war movie that didn\u2019t bring anything new to the genre.",
            "I've started watching Oppenheimer twice and find it really boring, its just people talking.  After about 35 minutes I get bored and do something else.  His other films, once I start watching them, I can't stop until they've finished.",
            "Did you post this before? Having some crazy deja-vu here",
            "I don't mind Jonathan Nolan, prior to Oppenheimer he really needs co writer.\u00a0",
            "The only thing that Christopher Nolan's films are missing is clear dialogue.\u00a0",
            "This is very true he needs someone to the writing",
            "tenet fuckin rubbed my itch for me i love that shit right in my veins",
            "I'm always amused by the perennial complaint that Nolan's movies are cold sterile places lacking soul and heart. Whether it's true or not, it's ironically one of the aspects I like about his movies. I'd rather be at a distance of characters than the director manipulate me with heavyhanded tactics utilising the camera and soundtrack to make me feel a certain way.  \n\nThe 'cold' nature of Dunkirk was utterly compelling to me. These guys were just random boys thrown into the meatgrinder, you're not meant to fall in love with them, they're just regular folk who have a host of flaws like we all do. Harry Styles character was a bit of a prick and *that's fine*.  \n\nBut more to the point, Michael Mann got the same complaints for most of his career too. People to this day still criticise Heat for being too 'cold and sterile' for them, etc.  \n\nIt's fine though, I wouldn't want a guy like Nolan to change his style. It provides variety to the cinematic landscape, there will always be directors like him and Mann who get the same criticisms, and I'm glad.",
            "Yeah but wtf happened with Westworld. Just started getting real wtf after S2. S2 seems like there was some interference which caused a pivot.",
            "Huh.\n\nI don't like Nolan.",
            "Agree. Dunkirk and Oppenheimer - while excellent - seem to lack heart. Tenet - while also excellent - covers the lack of heart with its heavy concept. \n\nI didnt know John wasnt working on these films. But it makes sense now.",
            "Dunkirk was great.",
            "Jonathan Nolan was recently on Arm Chair Expert and if y\u2019all haven\u2019t I\u2019d really recommend it. I knew next to nothing about him now I\u2019m a huge fan.",
            "\"Christopher Nolan fans fall into 2 categories. Those who prefer his films pre-2014 and those who prefer his films post 2014.\"\n\n  \nNot me, and nobody else I know would fit into your categories.  I think Dunkirk is better than Interstellar, but I really like them both.",
            "It\u2019s so strange, because I think Dunkirk is better than anything he\u2019s done in the past fifteen years. I think it blows Interstellar out of the water.",
            "Nolan started to unravel with Dark Knight Rises. It is an absolute mess of a movie that rides on the triumph of its 2 predecessors within the Nolan trilogy.",
            "I didn't realize this until you posted this, but yeah I totally agree with you.",
            "Sorry but Oppenheimer was outstanding. I agree about Dunkirk. Disagree about Tenet. It was classic Inception-Interstellar Nolan. If anything, Oppenheimer and Dunkirk were sort of departures, with Oppenheimer still being a masterpiece largely due to the fact that both Cillian Murphy and R Downey Jr. were perfectly cast with a tremendous script.",
            "Inception & the Dark Knight are perfection. \n\nWith Interstellar, I felt the movie was bursting at the seams but still entertaining.\n\nEveryone talks about the cool concept of time in Dunkirk. Nothing about the heart of the story and I doubt most people can even remember the characters.\n\nTenet was confusing, had a few cool moments, but was heartless. The final \"battle\" looked ridiculous.\n\nI haven't gotten around to Oppenheimer yet.",
            "Tenet is a borderline masterpiece from Nolan. To be fair, I didn't quite get it the first time viewing it and had to have subtitles on to understand what the characters were saying. Tenet is Nolan's James Bond spy thriller with a twist. After watching some YouTube videos with 3D representations and explanations of the concept of reverse entropy, the whole concept of the movie blew me away.",
            "Surprisingly, I prefer Oppenheimer to his other films specifically because of its script! The characters were more fleshed out than the previous scripts on his films. Of course, I love the Dark Knight. But Oppenheimer is genuinely that one film that I prefer to his other films in general.",
            "Don't know why, but for me Memento, Inception, Dunkirk and Oppenheimer are his best movies. \n\nAlso I wouldn't compare movies to tv series. Possibilities are so different.",
            "Nolan has the same issues as George Lucas. Great director, shitty writer.",
            "Christopher Nolan's movies are only good for one watch (for me), I can't stomach the rigidity. \nI think he's an amazing director. But the only movie I've been able to watch more than once by him is the dark knight.\n\nI have similar feelings to Denis Villeneuve  - but it's not rigidity. It's the emotional momentum, sometimes it just doesn't exist. And the films feel like a spectacle and nothing else, again, think he's an amazing director. \n\nHis films don't hit the same on the 2nd run, and personally I thought dune was only aesthetic. And quite frankly his worst movies.\n\nSomeone's films who I think have great rewatch capacity are S.Craig Zahlers movies (though very few).\n\nAnd I will say that maybe he's not as technically good as the aforementioned but he knows how to create emotional crescendos - usually very violent and stressful ones. His movies evoke distress, and any film that makes me feel anything is doing a fantastic job imo.\n\n\nAnother is Park-chan wook  for very similar reasons to Zahler.\n\nBut also he is  technically masterful.",
            "so overrated.   \n\nhis Batman movies are legendary, but the 3rd act in all 3 can suck my asshole.",
            "Learned about dude very recently when I noticed how incredible some of the Fallout tv episodes were. The first couple episodes are him directing and are extremely well done. \n  \nThe first three episodes effortlessly introduces so so much. I started noticing that so much character introduction, world building, and atmosphere was being done non-verbally and often in the background of a shot where something else is happening. There's a zillion very simple but intelligent and often overlooked decisions that make everything feel funny, easy to follow, and immersive. In the first three episodes he introduce like 9 full season plot threads, 3 main characters, multiple flashbacks, like twenty locations, and goddamn near 50 characters and all of them feel unique and effortless to follow.\n  \nWeird little note but he casts extremely different actors for the characters and they trend towards having very unique body types and appearances which makes it near impossible to confuse any of them. None of the locations were hard to follow, every flashback was easy to follow, lines weren't whispered over Chris Nolan audio mixing, all the humor stuck the landing, was quick, and moved on.\n  \nBack to the casting - I've had trouble with shows and movies with extremely similar looking characters and often have trouble following shows like game of thrones who might introduce 6 decrepit old men with long white hair at once or Haunting of Hill House with completely unestablished time jumps, scene changes, and characters that blend into each other. There was so many characters introduced in the first episode of fallout, and it starts out with them all wearing matching jumpers and you can't confuse a single character because every speaking role is very unique in some immediately visible way. Zach Cherry doesn't look like any other vault dweller, and neither does Dale Cooper, the Wanda Sykes type, the bug eyed pretty main girl, the tiny bug eyed brother, the large man who wants to fuck his cousin, or the blonde preggo pirate one. That's all just one half of one episode and this trend continues for every speaking character in the show and for every location and it is great. Very simple, but it's crazy how many shows and movies don't even consider it. \n  \nAnyhow, I noticed that my favorite Nolan movies had him writing and my least favorite ones did not. Interstellar, dark Knight, memento, and the prestige has him.\n  \nTenet and inception didn't and while they had tons to praise, they had a very distinguishable and often criticized issue with the writing.\n  \nI never got why sometimes I found Nolan movies incredible and sometimes pretty frustrating, and I think duder is why. Apparently I'm a Jonathan Nolan fan and I didn't know it until recently.",
            "I much prefer his stuff without Jonathan. I feel like Jonathan brings out his worst tendencies and generally brings down the film into genre fare",
            "They need each other, Jon keeps tanking projects to retell Person of Interest",
            "You may be onto something although since 2014 he has been doing quite different films. Dunkirk and Oppenheimer are nothing like anything he's done before so maybe Jonathan wouldn't have made a difference. And I think (while not his best) they are both very good. \n\nTenet is the best comparison point. It's easily his worst film. But I can't tell if it's a hot mess because Jonathan was missing or not. Let's not forget The Dark Knight Rises was not good. And Jonathan was involved in that.",
            "Nolan only has three films that were nominated for the most prestigious award categories. Inception, Dunkirk and Oppenheimer. Those are three films that Nolan has sole screenwriting credit for. So it's unlikely that Nolan himself would agree with you that he needs his brother to help him with his screenplays.\n\nAlso it's a shame Dunkirk didn't land for you. It's probably his most accomplished film. And I don't mean that from a technical standpoint.",
            "I disagree completely with pretty much everything said here. Oppenheimer is probably the best script that Nolan has ever written. Obviously it\u2019s all personal taste but looking back on his career, late period Nolan has far surpassed his early stuff for me. Tenet, Oppenheimer, and Dunkirk are all top 5 for me. The Dark Knight is a classic and obviously what made him a household name, but Inception does not hold up for me beyond the impact it had when it released in 2010; Batman Begins is fine, TDKR is a mess, and the The Prestige and Insomniac are fun but a little bumpy. Memento is a classic.\n\nI think Jonathan Nolan\u2019s output since their creative divorce kind of reinforces my feelings that he really didn\u2019t have much to do with Nolan\u2019s success. I stopped westworld around season 2 because it became unbearable, and while people seem to enjoy Fallout, I cannot stand it. I hope the lesser Nolan figures it out, but Oppenheimer really made me doubly excited for Christopher Nolan\u2019s ongoing solo career",
            "Nope. Jon's other shows have been mediocre",
            "There\u2019s a scene in Blade that matched the dark knights scene, actually two of them. In blade, Blade throws a person across two buildings, TDK zip lines between buildings.\n\nThen there\u2019s a mob scene in Blade that doesn\u2019t look anything like the pencil scene in TDK but it feels the exact same. \n\nWas this Jona or the other guy? (Forgetting his name I\u2019m sorry)",
            "Eh I wish I liked INTERSTELLAR. So many little things like that awkward moving robot that was supposed to be the comic relief I guess? Wes Bently death being a YOINK right as he enters the ship? The guy left behind on the ship for 20 years has a little Grey hair instead of just being played be a different older actor?",
            "I feel like the cold and clinical aspect played well into Oppenheimers tone as a film as well. I definitely would have liked it less if there was more \u201cpizaz\u201d to it",
            "Well put. Even with Inception, Leo spent a lot of time ensuring that the movie included a lot of heart and emotion. Watching Tenet helped to fully contextualize that point",
            "Emotion. Feeling. Christopher has none of that. Compare that with Fallout and Westworld and you see what is missing. I haven't cared about a character in any of Christopher's movies since.",
            "I agree. I always thought it was Chrisopher who brought the soul to the movies so it took me time to really see that it wasn't because I didn't want to believe otherwise. But it also made me feel like Jonathan isn't given enough credit by audiences because I think that a lot of us just thought he was kind of helping out in his brother's movies rather than being a crucial piece.",
            "I feel a lot of time the actors need to compensate for Nolan\u2019s writing just by sheer acting skills, lucky for him he has accesses to the best of the best but it still would be nice to have more human or relatable characters in his movies.",
            "A little *The Prestige* Reddit history I stumbled upon. 11-years ago, a Redditor claims that anyone who saw the ending coming is a fucking liar. No one notices that Jonathan Nolan himself comments \"[saw it coming a mile away](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1hpxpz/comment/cawvyqd/)\"",
            "The Prestige is my favorite Nolan movie. It is excellent. Every time I watch it I pick up on something new.",
            "That movie IS amazing! I still prefer Interstellar, but that's just my opinion!",
            "Probably my favorite movie of all time, with three of my favorite actors. Just so freaking good",
            "Aww, thank you for your kind response! In glad I could help you articulate the feeling. Honestly, it took me a while to do it myself!",
            "Exactly the same for me!",
            "The heart of tenet is the bromance between JW Washington and Pattinson though, not debicki",
            "I really enjoyed Dunkirk. The pace and the story for me was perfect. I liked the distance the characters had. As they kinda represented the every man.\u00a0\nPlus I saw it in the imax and that movie works so much better on the giant screen.\u00a0",
            "Absolutely I agree with you!",
            "It's a great show! The characters are fantastic and the idea of the show was fresh. And I think it did a similar, successful switcharoo in the third season of the show when it really dived deep into the science fiction as the movie From Dusk Til Dawn did in the half-point where it switched from a kidnapper/robber movie to snake-vampire action-horror.",
            "we just finished our re-rewatch! That show is more relevant than ever!",
            "I assume Jonathan\u2019s stock in the industry reached a point where he could branch off on his own and chose to do so. It\u2019s great when you a collaborative pair work so well together and it sucks when they split up to do solo stuff, but it can be understandable when both probably have very specific visions for projects they want to do on their own.\n\nChuck Russell and Frank Darabont were an amazing partnership for horror in the 80s with their work on Hell Night, Dream Warriors, and The Blob, but Darabont wanted to move on and gave us Shawshank Redemption.\n\nDon Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer basically reinvented the wheel when it came to action movies in the 80s, but Simpson\u2019s drug use resulted in their partnership breaking down during production of The Rock and he died before it was completed. Bruckheimer still made big hits, but Simpson\u2019s eccentricity was noticeably missing. \n\nBruckheimer and Michael Bay is another one. Bad Boys, The Rock, Armageddon, and Bad Boys 2 show how their styles just worked so well together, and most things they\u2019ve done separately since 2002 really haven\u2019t been the same. For Bruckheimer, National Treasure 1 & 2 and the first Pirates were great, and for Bay, Pain & Gain felt like 1993 Michael Bay, but most everything else has been lacking in one way or the other.\n\nFor the Nolans, I think Jonathan saw a chance to start overseeing productions and took it. Christopher used it as an opportunity to fully realize his own visions. I think when they worked together, they played to their strengths. Jonathan is a much better writer while Christopher has a top 1% director\u2019s mind. I hope they work together again soon.",
            "Jonathan got too big. He also kind of traded Christopher for his wife who he worked on Westworld and Fallout with. That, and they signed their own deal with Amazon. He doesn't really have time for Christopher anymore.\n\nChristopher did say he shows Jonathan his scripts and gets feedback on them. He said he wrote Oppenheimer in the downstairs of a house during COVID while Jonah was writing upstairs.",
            "I have no idea. But honestly I haven't looked it up. I have a twin sister that I'm very close with and we're movie buffs with the same pov on everything. We've always wanted to be actresses and make movies together so it makes me sad that they stopped making movies together. Hopefully they just wanted to make some projects apart (hopefully not permanently) and split amicably.",
            "He's too busy with TV",
            "I agree. But he used to be my #1. Dennis Villenue is now my #1 and Chris Nolan is my #2. That can always change, I still have hope!",
            "It might've been me! My post was deleted with no explanation less than an hour after I posted it. So I tried posting it again tonight.\u00a0",
            "I was just going to say the same thing. I saw this exact post a week ago, lol.",
            "And then someone else will do it, and in that thread someone else will and eventually the top keeps spinning",
            "That's a good point! That could be part of it. I don't know.",
            "I totally respect your opinion. I definitely think it was fantastic. And the last line of the film has stuck with me for a year. But I still felt it was missing some things. I think he could've pushed the limit or done more, especially considering the subject, if that makes sense?",
            "It's funny that you should say that, because Inception was also not (co) written by Jonathan.",
            "> The over-exposition, missed opportunities and multiple magic beans of Inception is a good example. (Still a great movie in many ways)\n\nJonathan did not work on Inception.",
            "Lol! I respect that. I really loved the idea of Tenet but I was dissapointed in the execution and the characters. It was also lacking the heart. I like it less ob my second viewing. But I still loved the idea, some of its message,\u00a0 and the directing.\n\n\nIt was the skeleton of a masterpiece and a reminder of what could've/should've been.",
            "I still haven't seen Oppenheimer but I love love Dunkirk. I appreciate so much kore after rewatching years after release.",
            "Maybe I'm remembering wrong, but didn't Lisa Joy kind of take over for the later seasons of Westworld and Jonathan took a step back? I remember seeing that in a behind the scenes making of the future seasons.\n\n\nI don't think that Jonathan Nolan didn't write or direct any of the episodes of Peripheral.\n\n\nI'm sorry you didn't enjoy Fallout. I really did.\u00a0\n\n\nI do really agree that they need eachother.",
            "I completely agree with you. My twin sister and I have been discussing this the last few years because he's always been our #1 but right now he's our #2. That can always change though!",
            "I totally respect your opinion!\u00a0\n\n\nI agree with the rest of your comment :)\n\n\nBranagh is a great actor but I don't think that his character was layered enough.\u00a0",
            "Man Tenant was straight trash. Half of the dialogue is total inaudible, and the whole climax is guys screaming at each other while dangling a giant MacGuffin over a hole. That isn't just bad writing, it is borderline intentionally bad writing. Like to parody and mock a bad action flick I would just cut the scene straight out of the movie and put it in a sketch show like SNL",
            "Tenet sounded interesting in the first previews, but it's like it falls flat when you finally see the movie. Several of Nolan's movies have some plot problems but not to the extent that it ruins the movies (always hated the skiing scenes in Inception but it's  more the set than the plot that irritates).\n\nI wonder what the most credible \"mind fuck\" movies are? Google suggest Primer, Mullholland Drive and 2001: A Space Odyssey\u00a0",
            ">Idk how you can look at Dunkirk and claim it's anything but phenomenal or use it as evidence of his downfall..\n\nI absolutely love Dunkirk but it's understandable that it was divisive among Nolan fans. If it doesn't immediately grab you with it's simple premise of survival then there isn't much to draw you in. That intense 2 hours you spent in the theatre was two hours of tedious noise for those that didn't click with the film.",
            "I mean, a lot of people didn't care for Dunkirk. I don't think it's phenomenal at all and a real missed opportunity. You must realize not everyone shares your opinion about these movies right?",
            "Strongly recommend the show Person of Interest if you like sci-fi. It was Johnathan Nolan's first series and it is all-time excellent in my opinion. It was overlooked since it was a CBS procedural show, but it does a great job with its overarching story and the last two seasons dive head-first into that arc mostly without the procedural format. \n\nIf you're in the U.S. it's free to watch with ads on Freevee.",
            "I really enjoyed Fallout and I hear that game fans were very pleased!",
            "I didn't know that! I will say that I think Christopher's three newer films are lacking in the female characters area. Not saying he doesn't have female characters in his movies, just that there lacking a certain something that makes me relate to them as a woman. Elizabeth Debicki's character in Tenet is the first that comes to my mind. And I dont count Oppenheimer because it's a historical movie so he didn't exactly write the female characters.\u00a0",
            "I have to agree. I love Nolan but I'm always surprised by the praise Dunkirk gets. I just found the whole thing pretty uninteresting and like we'd seen it all before.",
            "Facts. I saw Oppenheimer in theaters and i was fidgeting the whole time. And I\u2019m somebody who LOVES movies. Oppenheimer just did not work for me at all",
            "I did, last week. But it was removed (no reason given) within an hour of my posting it.",
            "I have to disagree. I don't think he's a shitty writer by any means. Dunkirk and Oppenheimer were still amazing movies, in my opinion.",
            "I agree that I think they need eachother! They both make amazing projects separately but make masterpieces together (in my opinion, not stating a fact)!\n\n\nEdit to add: I don't think that Jonathan is doing a bad job at all on his own.\u00a0",
            "Dunkirk and Oppenheimer are like nothing he's done before. Because he always made more sc-fi ish type stuff, or just fiction in general. I thought they were great movies too, just not masterpieces. But I don't necessarily think anyone else could've made them better if they were the director/writer. It's just that I think his movies have become colder, more analytical, and are lacking that last level of heart/soul and spark.\u00a0\n\n\nControversial opinion, but I absolutely loved DKR.",
            "Which ones? Person of Interest was fantastic, and Fallout has been considered a huge success.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso, I'm not saying that Jonathan was the ONLY reason that those movies were masterpieces. Just that the two brothers together make masterpieces and Jonathan's noticably missing from Christopher's last three movies. Also, Jonathan Nolan hasn't made any movies on his own, only TV series.",
            "Absolutely. It couldn't be a charismatic movie by nature. It would've been disrespectful to have pizaz. But it was missing a little bit of feeling to me personally, for the subject matter. But I will say, the last line of the film has stuck with me for the last year and it really made the whole movie for me. It was almost like the whole movie was to build up that final line and it really made an impact on me.",
            "Westworld had one good season.",
            "Person of Interest is Jonathan Nolan's best work. Best character work, full of emotion and feeling and criminally underrated.",
            "That's actually hilarious lol",
            "Omfg thats really him",
            "I think you articulated it really well\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s not that his new movies are *bad*, they\u2019re just *different*. They have a bit less \u2018pizzazz\u2019 as another commenter put it. Which served the tone of Oppenheimer really well. But I think Tenet would have benefited from Jonathan. And I love Dunkirk but I\u2019m open to the possibility that it could\u2019ve been 10-15% better with Jonathan\u2019s input.",
            "Lol, honestly!",
            "I love how articulated your comment is. I completely agree with you. I do hope they do some projects together again while they're doing their own.",
            "Your last paragraph indicates that they split on good terms then! I do hope they make more projects together. I like Lisa Joy but she's no Chris Nolan or Jonathan Nolan. Not yet, at least. Once she kind of took the front seat in Westworld, it went down hill (although, I don't know for certain if it was mostly because of\u00a0her, I'm just speculating) Plus, she wrote/directed Reminiscence, and while it was beautifully shot, the story wasn't good.",
            "Yep, it most likely was you lol. Bit crap that it was deleted without explanation.",
            "Lol! Hey, the same people are seeing it within an hour of me posting it! That's super cool!",
            "Meanwhile, the sound design will emphasise explosions over coherent dialogue.",
            "Collaboration is easy to talk about but can be hard to do, everyone\u2019s egos can get in the way.  And I do think Christopher has blind spots/weak points, that can be hard to point out to someone who is running the project without it feeling like criticism and Christopher has a tight circle of people he works with, also he comes across as very driven and he is successful.  That makes it hard for anyone new to point out small problems in a constructive manner.   But all of this is speculation, we will know if this is case.  But I do Christopher more recent films are just some sort of interplay between the characters and in Fallout and Westworld that element is there.",
            "Is that right? Interesting, I had forgotten that one. I picked it because it\u2019s the Chris Nolan movie I\u2019m most familiar with. whoops, haha",
            "None of them was, except phps Neil, which was surprising at that time (yeah, i know, he is a good actor, forgetting Twilight, forgetting Twilight). It looked like if he was the only actor, who barely understood the script, with all it's impacts to the persons. Or in other words, his role was \"a little bit dramatic\".",
            "I watched that in a drive-in during the pandemic and attributed the inaudible dialogue\u00a0largely due to the sound coming through my car radio, turns out it was inaudible for everyone and I haven\u2019t bothered to watch again to check",
            "I rewatched it with a friend and were pausing a lot to talk about what was going on. My opinion of it went way down after discussing it in detail with someone. The movie has some cool visuals but jesus christ.",
            "Yeah, I have very good hearing but I had so much trouble with that movie. It was baffling to me. His response to the mixing criticism made me lose a lot of respect for him too, honestly. Felt pompous or something, not entirely sure how to articulate it.",
            "Primer is definitely one.  I watched that when I was like 16 and sick with the flu. That was an experience.",
            "Nice I\u2019ll check it out, thanks\u00a0",
            "Dude I sooo agree. There is something missing as far as a \"strong\" female character in his movies, but Selina Kyle was so different. Although I gotta give props to Elliott Page's character.\u00a0",
            "Yeah, I love movies - I watch probably 5-7 of them every week.  I find Oppenheimer weird as well, as the soundtrack while people are talking sounds like something out of an action movie.  It just feels weird.",
            "Your opinion is seemingly in alignment in our reality of good story telling!",
            "I get what you mean but I think Josh Harnett, Mark Rylance and Robert Pattinson all show that he can still handle the heart/soul. Honestly I think he just became interested in different things.\n\nWe will have to agree to disagree on DKR. I liked bits of it but I liked bits of Tenet.",
            "\u201c I believe we did.\u201d",
            "I'd argue Season 2 was good. If anything, the Akacheta episode alone makes up for the rest of it being such a mess.",
            "While the second wasn't a masterpiece like the first, it was entertaining and I think fair to say reached the level of \"good.\"",
            "I'm speaking of the emotion in those shows. It's what's desperately missing from Christopher's movies. \n\nOverall, Westworld only works for a season. Probably the same for Fallout. But they play emotion and humanity very very well in those seasons.",
            "Lol sitting at 6 upvotes",
            "I mean, they didn't actually ever \"split\" seeing as they were never actually \"together\". Sure, they worked together most of the time but they were never like the Coen Brothers or something. Jonathan's been doing his own thing for a while now, he originally wrote Interstellar by himself and he did Person of Interest for 5 seasons before Westworld came to fruition. Even Chris did Inception without Jonathan.",
            "Thank you!! I've been stewing on this for years and wanted to discuss it online.",
            "WHAT? CAN'T HEAR YOU. I'll just put subtitles on",
            "Also, I think Robert Pattinson just brought the magic that I'm talking about to that role. I also give credit to the little bit that Aaron Taylor Johnson was in the movie.\u00a0\n\n\nJohn David Washington dissapointed me in Tenet. I don't think he was ready for that type of movie/role. He was amazing in BlacKkKlansman and I think he really found his footing in The Creater, too. Albeit, more as the film went on.\u00a0",
            "Mixing is actually one of the reasons I do not see his movies in theaters most of the time. It was really bad in Tenet, but basically all of his movies that I can remember have terrible mixing. The movies are so loud that I want to wear earplugs, but if I do that I can't hear the dialogue. So I usually end up waiting any watching them when I can control the volume and put subtitles on.\n\nIt is not just limited to him, though he is one of the worst offenders. So many big budget movies do exactly the same thing and I legitimately cannot understand why. My theory, based on nothing, is that because the people working on it already know the dialogue they do not recognize how difficult it can be to understand when every other sound in the movie is blaring. And I think they make the sound so loud to try and bring you into the world of the movie more.\n\nRegardless of why though, I hate it. Ruins movies for me.",
            "I'm glad we have the same view! Yeah! I don't know... personally I find his female characters to be kind of too mean and cold. Women can be strong without being ice. Elliot Page's character was great, too. But again, Jonathan wrote those movies too.",
            "I\u2019ve thought a lot about Oppenheimer and how much i do not understand the praise it\u2019s getting. Oppenhiemer being a shit movie is one of my hottest takes apparently lol. Glad to meet somebody who agrees it\u2019s not the best movie ever made haha. What movies have you watched this week btw?",
            "Honestly brings tears to my eyes.",
            "I adore that episode!",
            "It was a great episode but it doesn't make up for the rest by a long shot. Season 3 was weak, 4 improved but still, with one truly great season out of four, OP is giving Jonathan way too much credit",
            "The seasons after 1 tend to work well emotionally but not logically. Which supports the argument that the brothers work best supporting each other and shoring up the other\u2019s weak points.",
            "Can\u2019t say I agree with you. Oppenheimer and Dunkirk had plenty of emotion. I think what you\u2019re looking for is a soap opera.",
            "I, too, want to know what movies you guys have been seeing this week.\u00a0",
            "I agree. My twin sister any I say we're the Ying to eachothers' Yang. I feel the same way about the Nolan brothers. Although, I will say that season 1 of Westworld wasn't just fantastic but was a masterpiece.",
            "Dunkirk might be the least emotional war movie Ive ever seen. Its all spectacle, cant even remember the character's names",
            "Oppenheimer lacks so much honest emotion. I personally like Dunkirk,  but certainly not because of the emotion between characters.\n\nTennet is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in terms of character dynamic and emotion. \n\nMaybe you're looking for a textbook?",
            "I think you may be confusing dramatic scoring and visual grandeur for emotion. \n\nLook, I like and enjoyed this films a lot, but it\u2019s hardly a lie to state that his films are, generally, quite analytical and cold in their execution. He\u2019s a very precise filmmaker, kind of like Fincher, but (Christoffer) Nolan always seems to be most interested in the overall story and telling it in a visual way. Characters always come second in his films, they\u2019re necessary to tell the story but he doesn\u2019t really care if they say the best lines or are even seen on screen. Hardy\u2019s roles in both Batman and Dunkirk were both basically just voice roles, and even then often only because you needed a voice to have any exposition, but especially in Dunkirk, what mattered was the *story* and *visual storytelling* of the plane, not necessarily the pilot himself. \n\nHe also often has tons of tension and conflict, but again, that\u2019s not necessarily the same as *emotion*, and even if a character is at some point saying something in an emotional state, *the film* doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect that. It just treats it as any other scene. \n\nI would say Interstellar is probably one of his more emotional films, and even there it\u2019s only in a few short moments where the film allows the entire scene to be truly about emotion.",
            "*Yin",
            "There's more to emotion than the characters having names. They're soldiers, we see the emotion in their courage, their fear, their choices.",
            "Yeah, Nolan is incredibly impressive in technical skill, but doesn't do feelings and strong emotions well most of the time.",
            "I must only like dishonest emotion then."
