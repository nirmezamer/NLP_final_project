        "content": "Howdy r/GamingLaptops community,\n\nI'm excited to announce that we're working hard on launching our official Discord server! The release date is expected to be later this month or early July. However, if unforeseen circumstances arise, there might be a slight delay. Rest assured, the server will be coming extremely soon its just a matter of bot & server related structuring.\n\nOur goal is to create a beneficial and streamlined server for all users. We're experimenting with our own bot, Buzz, adding innovative functionalities, and ensuring the community has a say in the direction we take. Toxic meming culture will be discouraged; we focus on activity, knowledge, good sportsmanship, and fostering great community attributes.\n\nThere will be no paid roles or donation links or focused financial incentives. We value genuine engagement, activity, and contribution. However, we may only add supporter roles in the future if we achieve the goals set.\n\nIf you have questions ask them in the comments!\n\nThank you for your patience!\n\nBest, Melm",

            "Excellent to see, better to refine the server than set dates in stone and rush things.",
            "Great news!",

Should I drain it 'til it shuts down or charge it to 100% at least once then limit next charges to 85 to 90% and never let it drain?\n\nThank you everyone!",

            "That\u2019s an old myth.",
            "New laptops have battery management programs that help you get the most out of your battery. The most common settings will be 80% charging while running of wall power. There\u2019s a lot of old information about batteries that come from the days when batteries had nickel in them and would develop problems due to battery memory. The new lithium polymer batteries don\u2019t have the same issues.",
            "Oh no. You should do neither. Only let it charge to 100% when you\u2019re going out\n\nLet me explain: when the battery is perfectly balanced at 50%. Between two sides, both sides are perfectly content at staying that way. But let\u2019s say it\u2019s at 0% or 100%. Then you risk battery damage because the charge on one side is significantly higher than the other. Hence  one side desperately wants to move to the other side. And the other side desperately wants to gain some from the higher charge side.\n\n(Sorry for any mistakes I made, it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done any explaining on this)\n\nSo. The best charge at all times is a perfect 50%. 50% full. Or 50% empty. Plus since you\u2019re always gonna keep it plugged it when gaming, It\u2019s going to continually be taking in power. So go to your control center and set the battery cap to 50%. And only too 100% when you go out.",
            "Using the MyASUS app limit the charge to 80%\n\nOr use GHelper and set it to 70% thats while on use. If you are gaming while it\u2019s charging it\u2019s better to limit the charge to avoid battery degradation",
            "I see you have a G14 there, install G-Helper from Github and set the charge limit to 50% when you're using wall charging. Only charge it to 100% when you're going out and not expect a wall plug to be available for an extended period. The G14 has excellent battery life anyway so I wouldn't worry about that, just focus on preserving your battery and getting the most out of it.",
            "not required. just remove  the bloat you get on windows. and enjoy your new laptop.",
            "On a brand new machine, I always do a couple of full cycles. Charge 100% and drain until shut off. It helps bed in the cells and then windows also has an idea of battery potential.\n\nAfter than I leave it on the safe charging settings of about 80% and do a full cycle every month or so since it stays plugged in most of the time anyway.\n\nThey normally suggest keeping it between 20-80% for general cycles since it wears the battery less. On the other hand I was told my battery specialists that if you keep it plugged in most of the time at 80%, its important to do full cycles to keep its capacity and output.\n\nDepends what you read and where, over the past few years battery tech and treatment of them keeps changing.",
            "It's an old myth. Btw Nice laptop man, can you tell me the full specs?",
            "I think G14 ryzen comes with undervolted GPU",
            "For the love of everything good, please don't smother your laptop's bottom vents by putting them flat on the bed. Those internal cooling fans will be gasping for air. This has been a common cause for overheating and system failures.",
            "Dude \nDont put it on a soft surface!!!!!\nThe fan needs air",
            "Do nothing, just use it however you want. Use it plugged in or on battery or play football with it. It doesn't care.",
            "The sweet spot for charging is between 40% and 80%.\n\nAlso, new lithium ion batteries don't need to be fully discharged or fully charged on the first go-around. This is an unfortunate carry-over that some people still push that was only applicable to \\*much\\* older battery technologies.",
            "Lithium batteries only get damaged when fully depleted. So basicly it doesnt really matter anymore.",
            "throw it :)",
            "Very old one. Oh and op should remove battery when on cord to protect it!",
            "Not a myth though, just not true for modern batteries",
            "Can I get the source for this?\nI remember learning about this during one of my classes lol",
            "Video or article for this? Thank you.",
            "They come with lower wattage GPUs because Asus wanted to get a better heat management. It\u2019s a thin laptop.",
            "Damn why didn't i think of this like the past 10 years",
            "https://youtu.be/UpqaQR4ikig?si=BglwIb6-rUHY9rcx\n\nAround 04:00",
            "It's the same with a phone, everyone recommends to keep it between 20% and 80%, less charge cycles, longer lasting battery. I don't know how many people actually do that religiously but that's the best for a battery.",
            "Lots of recent phones have options that cap charging at 80% and turn it off at 20%. I've got it capped at 80 but don't have the 20% part enabled, I tend to get home with maybe 10% remaining sometimes",
            "I cap my Legion laptop at 50-60% and use it plugged in at the desk almost 99.99% of the time. After 8 months, the capacity went down from 83 to 82Whr (the standard capacity is 80Whr), so a 1% loss.\n\nI cap my ThinkPad laptop at 80% but I use it more like a \u201claptop\u201d, meaning charging and discharging. After 6 months 5% of the original battery is already degraded.\n\nTherefore, as long as you keep it plugged, the laptop will pull the power directly from the charger, hence not degrading the battery."
