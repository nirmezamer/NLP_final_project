        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/1dloit0/bought_a_foreclosure_previous_owner_wants_the/",
        "content": "Hey everyone! This one's a bit of a doozy, so I apologize in advance!\n\nSo two months ago we bought a house in Northern BC. It was a foreclosure sold \"as is where is\" by the bank who took it from the previous owner between 3.5 and 4 years ago. Not only was it sold \"as is where is\" but the purchase agreement explicitly states that at date of possession the seller is required to leave the property vacant. In the time the bank owned it the guy admits to having squatted in the home and even let other people squat there while he didn't. He's also a hoarder-type and a junkyard mechanic. I'm sure if any of you have driven around rural BC you know exactly the type. The 2 acre property was absolutely jam packed with old vehicle and garbage. There's even a dilapidated mobile home sitting in the middle of it all. A clause in our mortgage as well as insurance states that we have until a certain date to clean up the property. We were fine with this and ready and willing to put the work in. Moreover, some of the items would be worth some amount of money, even in scrap metal, which would help pay for the renovations. In the few weeks where he found out that the house was being bought to when we took possession he cleared out about half of the property. Because I knew he wanted the stuff, and we needed to get rid of it, and despite knowing that we technically owned it and could make some money off of it, I was more than happy to give the guy some more time. We knew that, being a hoarder-type, he cared about all of it despite most of it being literal garbage. I was trying to be a nice person and not completely cut the guy off if some of the stuff was sentimental. We also thought that since he had cleared much of it in 3 weeks that he wouldn't take too much longer than that to finish. We had some stipulations to this deal and gave it an end date of two months.\n\n\\*\\*A:\\*\\* He couldn't just take anything. He had to tell us what he was taking as we may have decided to keep it. He had to ask us if he could take specific things and we would give him the ok or not.\n\n\\*\\*B:\\*\\* He had to tell us when he was coming.\n\nWell. After we took possession he broke both of those stipulations. He came only twice in 2 months, both times unannounced, and both times took things without informing us. I reminded him multiple times throughout the two months of the stipulations and end date. He did sometimes tell us that he would come, but then never did. He also kept speaking as if he owned the stuff, saying things like \"I'll give you this\" despite me reminding him that he didn't own any of it and technically it was already mine. We didn't have any written agreement, but have proof of this from references in text messages as well as security cameras.\n\nThe very last day of the agreement was 7 days ago. On that day he came around 18:30 and hooked up a boat and loaded some boxes full of old magazines (not the boxes with pictures of his kids, mind you) and was telling me that he's going to go hard the next week getting stuff. I told him that the deal was over because we couldn't trust that he was going to follow through given his behaviour over the past two months and that we had an obligation to get rid of stuff. I explained that we're paying 4 times what insurance would be because the insurer considered the mess that much of a liability and we can't afford to store the stuff. He offered to pay us to keep it there and I said no because we still are obligated to remove it. \n\nUnbeknownst to me, after I spoke to him my partner made a deal with him that if he could remove the dilapidated mobile home (that's the biggest liability) within 7 days, then he could have another 2 weeks to help \"clean up the property\". Up until now we had never, and still now didn't, specify he could take anything other than this mobile home. She added the same stipulations to this, that he couldn't take \\*anything\\* else, and he \\*had\\* to tell us when he was coming. She explained that if he failed to uphold his end that the deal was null and void. This was all via text, with very official language and dates and even specifying the address. He agreed to it and two days later he broke it by coming onto the property unannounced twice, and one of those times, taking more things that he wasn't allowed to. So we informed him that he broke the conditions of our deal and to not come back to the property or else we would consider it trespassing and have to involve the RCMP.\n\nHe freaked out, tried to justify what he took by saying that it was at the front of the property by the house, and even questioned why we moved a lawnmower from the same area back about 40 feet behind a wire we put up to prevent strangers from driving back and stealing things. He was still, after all this, acting as if he owned things or had some kind of right to them. He informed us that he would be involving his lawyers, the RCMP, and then said that he was going to serve me later in the week.\n\nWe filed a police report for the theft, but decided to forgo pressing charges for now. We were told we can decide to do so later. \n\nI feel I should also note that in the past two months, and increasingly over the past two weeks, we've had no fewer that 8 random vehicles drive onto our property, slow down or even stop for a while, before leaving and driving away. My wife feels very intimidated by this and is scared that he's asking people to come scope out the house (I work from home sometimes).\n\nTwo days ago he showed up at my house with a flat-deck trailer and two friends in separate trucks. One of which I have a recording of as being one of those unrecognized vehicles. He called me and asked if I wanted to call the cops or he should as he was here to take one of the vehicles and a motorcycle. We both called and the RCMP showed up. They were here for 3.5 hours, and spent 2.5 talking to him. In the times they did talk to us and we showed them all the texts, as well as our purchase agreement, and explained the situation, they seemed to think that we were well within our rights to do what we did. Eventually they got him to leave with the understanding that he was not allowed to step foot on the property again. Well he showed up again today to \"serve\" me by leaving a Notice of Claim for small claims court. The \"Defendants\" section that he filled out, though, isn't filled out properly at all. It has the wrong phone number and a completely different name (think \"James\" vs. \"Patrick\"), though he does name my wife correctly. Moreover, he doesn't actually specify anything in the claim. Just \"many items\".\n\nNow he's trying to intimidate me over text, as well. I haven't responded to anything in a week.\n\nWe are in the process of getting a lawyer, but I wanted to ask here too. Thanks for reading this far!\n\n\\*\\*QUESTIONS:\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*1.\\*\\* What exactly does \"as is where is\" mean in this instance?\n\n\\*\\*2.\\*\\* If the seller was required to leave the property vacant, does that mean everything that was left upon possession is considered abandoned?\n\n\\*\\*3.\\*\\* If he has a registration for a vehicle in his name does he, even after all of this, still have a right to claim that vehicle? Does this change if the registration is expired and never renewed?\n\n\\*\\*4.\\*\\* If the Notice of Claim is not filled out properly, doesn't specify anything, and was delivered by himself not to myself but my door, do I have to do anything with it?\n\n\\*\\*5.\\*\\* Where are the different possible places you can see this ending up?\n\n\\*\\*6.\\*\\* Do you have any other advice or can point me in the direction of something I haven't considered?",

            "Speaking from the lender\u2019s side of things they probably over inflated your tenure because they are lazy. Dealertrack or RouteOne (depending which one the dealership uses) requires a minimum 2 year history of employment and address history. So they will usually default both fields to 2/3 years because they are too lazy to ask or feel \u201cit\u2019s an inconvenience to ask my customer\u201d for the appropriate information. Which I feel is complete BS from my point of view but w/e. \n\nAs far as I am aware registration can\u2019t be completed without a bill of sale but it is also extremely easy to be undone. As far as financing goes unless we have ALL pieces required for funding (which includes the PAD/void chq) that car isn\u2019t getting funded and the dealership isn\u2019t getting paid. I can\u2019t count how many times I have had to pull deals from funding for outstanding documentation resulting in the contracts expiring (exceeding the first payment date).\n\nThe safety was likely completed in anticipation of the delivery. But that means nothing if you haven\u2019t signed all the paperwork dealership is on the hook for it. I wouldn\u2019t sweat it too much, they might keep your deposit but that is about all they can do.\n\nYou can report them to OMVIC however not much will likely come of it. You would be better to call the lender\u2019s customer service and file a complaint. At least for us it launches an investigation on that dealership and can result in their deals going under the microscope (both past and future deals).",

My experience with AMVIC (the Alberta agency that is supposed to deal with such things) basically told me that they wouldn't do anything to punish them that I would simply need to walk away from the deal.\n\nThat being said you have the right to give them an honest review and if the Dealership tries to threaten you with any legal action over your negative review that's where your documentation of the truth will save you. Funnily enough, if they do go after you, you could counter sue them for more than you'd pay for your car!\n\nBut as fun as that would be, the best thing is to simply tell them off, and do your business with someone better.\n\nGood luck!",

            "Cremation is the easiest way",
            "I'm assuming you are appointed the Executor.  Best pointers I can give you:\n\nThe funeral home will supply you with a death certificate, ask them if they supply additional certified copies (would be for a fee).  You may need at least two once you get back to Canada. Never take apart his will to make copies, leave it stapled.  You'll need to keep his ashes in the box with certification from them in order to travel with his ashes so don't worry about picking up a special urn or anything unless you want one when you get back.  \n\nTake the original will and death certificate to his bank to start the process getting access to his accounts, if the teller is young again confirm they are not to remove the staples from the will when they copy it.   You'll want his accounts frozen ASAP.   His regular accounts will not earn interest and his debts will not add interest from date of death, but if he has a mortgage etc they will need to be paid until deemed sold.\n\nIf he has a car and insurance they'll want the original will to transfer to you until you sell, you need to send the original will for Probate, so you have to do everything else before sending it for probate to avoid waiting.  They will transfer it \"to the Estate of\" then when you get probate you take that copy to them and they can transfer it to your name to sell.  \n\nBecause he died in Mexico I'd worry a bit about identity theft, go to Services Canada with the Original will and Death certificate ASAP to cancel his SIN.  If he was retired you'd want to cancel any CPP or OAS payments ASAP to avoid the hassle of having to return them.  If he died in June you can keep any payments that arrive in June.  The funeral homes usually apply for the CPP death benefit but you may have to do it at Service Canada if they don't because it was Mexico.\n\nIf he has a reasonable sized estate just hire an estate lawyer to do the rest (probate, will check, and help sell any real estate), and find out if he had a regular accountant (look for tax returns particularly if he has stocks to sell or investments) and ask them to do the final returns.  \n\nKeep every receipt in a folder by date, if there are other beneficiaries you can be reimbursed for your costs to travel and cremation etc out of his estate and then the rest is split. If you are the only heir then you get it all anyway.\n\nSorry for your loss.",
            "Lots of good advice here but didn't see: contact the Canadian Consulate in Mexico. \n\nSorry if this is redundant. I'm unclear also if OP is physically in Canada or Mexico while posting",
            "Hey there. I\u2019m very sorry for your loss. This happened to my mother in the US back in March. Mostly just get like 20 copies of the death certificate. Bringing him back will be straight forward from a customs, etc POV. As long as there\u2019s no communicable disease involved they literally don\u2019t care.",
            "I just went through this as the executor for my aunts will. Anyone and everyone involved is going to want an official copy of that death certificate. You may even need forms from their family doctor outlining their recent health in order to get insurance pay outs, that was the most fun for me as the doctor was 8 hours away and on leave at the time\u2026 \n\nSorry for your loss OP. The funeral home was a great resource for getting things going. Just remember to claim the Ontario death benefit if they were an Ontario resident and to file the appropriate taxes on time so you don\u2019t end up with interest penalties on anything owed.",
            "Yes, he has a will. I have that paperwork in Canada. I\u2019m more concerned about what I might need (from/ in Mexico) to send off to all the agencies here to close accounts. Do I only need a death certificate?",

They said it was in the works of being changed and streamlined so hopefully that was done.\n\nAt each location we had to tell them what we needed, they print a QR code, have to take that to a bank and pay the bank for the service, take that receipt back to the office and they will certify the death certificate at that government level.\u00a0",

Everything gets back dated to date of passing and it doesn\u2019t make a difference when you start the process. I\u2019ve never worked on an estate with a death certificate from another country so I can\u2019t speak to that part but usually that\u2019s all I need to process the account changes, especially if theres already beneficiaries on the account. Sometimes a Will is helpful too. Good luck and my condolences.",

I\u2019m lucky to have never needed this tip, but I\u2019ve heard the bereavement discount is from the rack rate/list price that nobody is actually paying to fly.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/1dlukix/father_paying_child_support_x2_kids_were_taken/",
        "content": "Greetings,\n\nAs the title says above, I am a single father father paying child support to X2 kids, age 9.  I have been separated from the mother since they were approx 2 years old.  I have recently returned from a 6 month workplace task outside of Canada.  Upon returning to Canada the following has happened withing a span of 2 weeks.\nAfter the last week of school had passed, I was contacted by the mother's brother (my children's uncle), informing me that he cares about his nephews and he is concerned about the well-being of them.  He told me that the mother has admitted to doing the drug DMT in the presence of my children, and her living place is a disaster and unsafe. He feels at this point the mother is no longer capable of raising her children.\nAlso, to add to the story, the mother also has another son, from another relationship, no relation to me. He is 17yrs old and has recently moved back in with the mother.  This older son has been relaying information to the uncle for the last 2 months about the situation.  Me and the older son are still friends on Facebook and are friends.  He confirmed all mentioned info about the frequent  drug use and he even sent me a video of the current living conditions of the place.  I screen shotted all the conversations and forwarded the video to CPS.\nOnce CPS got a hold of  the conversations, video, and statements from me, the uncle, and her older son, 4 days later social services or CPS took the children away from her and gave them to me.  I also filed a police report with the RCMP, and I also notified their school of the situation. Now my real question, OUR CUSTODY AGREEMENT:\n\nwe never really had an on paper legal agreement.  We never wanted to go through the court system.  All we had was a VERBAL AGREEMENT. Now before you judge, when we first seperated, she wasn't really into heavy drugs, she just smoked cannabis and occasionally drank alcohol, but more importantly, we trusted each other well enough to put the children first. Her deterioration I suspect only happened within the past 2-3 years. I could never prove it until the uncle and older son came forward and told me.  The agreement is very basic but here it is:\n\n- I would pay 1000cad per month for X2 children\n- I would get them every other weekend, and also on my vacation days as reasonable as possible (I travel a lot for work, and I also have a lot of time off due to vacation and travel days)\n\nBig questions here: \n\n- do I have to currently pay her child support when they are with me?\n- since it is only a verbal agreement, would there be any legal ramifications if I don't ?\n- I am looking into getting a lawyer, how much will this cost me ? \n- if I feel my children are unsafe, do I have to give them back to her?  She needs to produce a clean drug test in order to be able to see her kids.\n\n",

            "NAL. You're going to need a custody order and, given the circumstances, should retain a lawyer to petition for an emergency custody order. Until you get the ok from a judge, the kids rightfully belong to both of you, meaning the police can't take the kids from you for her, but if she did take then back you couldn't have the cops stop her either. Its a very vulnerable position that needs legal clarity for the best outcome.\n\nWithout a court order, there's no need to pay child support. You may get conflicting advice on this point, as sone would argue to keep paying until you're told to stop by a court. I personally believe the better move is to put payments in a separate savings account so, if order by a judge, you can pay back any arrears. Again, the court order is imperative in this.\n\nAs for lawyer costs, call around and get some quotes, most lawyers will do a free consultation. With an emergency court order, and the speed you need everything done, I imagine you'll be looking at 15k to 20k when the dust settles. A pittance for your kids safety, but a lot of money that may require a payment plan. Good to inquire at these consultations is that type of plan.\n\nThe last question about giving the children back is a difficult one. If I felt my kids were unsafe, and I had evidence to that point, I'd also refuse. However, the court may not love that because you've kept a routine and are now breaking it without a court order. I think the smartest thing to do is to keep the kids, assume the mother may call the police (whereby the lack of court order will work in your favor) and start your lawyer search immediately. Again, the key is an emergency custody order with an eye on a future custody hearing."
