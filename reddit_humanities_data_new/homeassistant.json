            "Hey, just wanted to mention I love the new look - so much more suited for HA!  Nice work!",
            "Hey I'm new here and just starting to dive into smart led lights and light bulbs...\n\nProbably a stupid question but  are smart lights  only going to work on the app they recommend?\n\nIs there a better app to few to choose from rather than using generic (my first 2 bulbs are Jinvoo) one the product recommends.\n\nIf I want to build \"scenes\" (I think that's what they are called according to my all) where would be a good place to start. Would love to have green/red combo for xmas, but not sure if I can teach myself by then\n\nThanks for any and all suggestions, going to go browse the sub now and try not to be jealous lol",
            "I have been using Home Assistant for about 8 years, off and on. I was attracted to it initially since it was the only HA system that didn't use Java. I'm a Python veteran and have been using Linux since Redhat version 1.\n\nI am becoming increasingly frustrated with Home Assistant since the developers have decided that Docker is the only way to implement additions. I really hate Docker for several reasons, but mostly because so much of it is tied to \"magic\" and the Docker cloud. One of the major selling points of Home Assistant is the independence provided since you don't need any \"cloud\" providers to get the job done.\n\nI currently use Proxmox on a rather large server and have little need for SBCs to run things like HA. With a substantial UPS, my system can weather several hours of failed commercial power. I find it much easier to just spin up a Proxmox container than to fiddle around with a Docker container. \n\nI realize that most HA users are not Linux experts and that the \"plug-and-play\" installation on an RPI or other SBC is attractive, but for those of us who really like to tinker, that is not much fun. \n\nBeing a dinosaur is such a challenge.",
            "no IRC?",
            "Hey u/Frenck_nl (I am only really tagging you as I have seen you active here a bit in the past) is it possible to take at look at github pull for gotify notifications? [https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/53050](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/53050)\n\nIts been basically ready for a while now and pings to the reviewers has done nothing to assist in getting this merged.\n\nBeing on a degoogled platform I am unable to use FCM and i would like to have notifications back working. Gotify is fairly useful in that regard for other self hosted apps/services so wouldn't mind this being included",
            "Finally bit the bullet and started setting HA up, working through the docs to get various things integrated.\n\nI have noticed some odd behaviour, with HA running some.of my hue lights appear to be changing to white.\n\nI have no automation or anything running yet, just hue integrated.\n\nI turned the HA VM off and this has stopped happening.\n\nHas anyone encountered this before?",

            "I started with home assistant new and try to implement and Tuya switch for a door. But I can only integrate the switch for the door to send the signals or the sensor to get the current status.\nI don't know how I can integrate both functionalities with local tuya.",

            "Thanks!",
            "Short answer : it depends.\n\nLonger answer: i have Ikea Tradfri bulbs which use zigbee to communicate. You can use them without any companion app but the functionality will be very limited (for example: you could pair them with Ikea Tradfri motion sensor but you won't be able to customize the way it operates).\n\nMore functionality is achieved by using a zigbee gateway - if you will use an Ikea one, you will need to use ikea app to control it.\n\nIf you will pair it with a vendor-agnostic gateway your options are limited only by hardware and firmware of each device.\n\nI am controlling my ikea bulbs by my own server equipped with Conbee 2 zigbee gateway - all automations are made on Home Assistant and on NodeRed addon.\n\nMy recommendation for you would be to search for the devices which use zigbee (not WiFi) and are being able to communicate without access to cloud.",
            "\\>are smart lights only going to work on the app they recommend?\n\nI'd like to know that too.",
            "No need to hate on docker, man. It's just a bunch of kernel features for process isolation put together. There's no cloud. Just image registry for downloading images - that's no different than fetching an rpm from a repository.",
            "I like to tinker and docker is really helpful for this. It's not only the plug and play side of things, it's the \"when something fucks up I know how to unfuck it back\". In relative difficulty, I'd rate setting up a proxmox container and a docker container about the same.",
            "I have HA running on debian here and yes, it runs in docker. for backups, that adds an extra challenge, that i have overcome by making an image of the drive using filezilla to another drive. Plain and simple. i do this manually now, but when i have the time, i want to use Veeam for this and then i can schedule jobs and at that point it becomes \"set and forget\" for me. :-)\n\nIsn't is possible for you so install HA OS in a proxmox-container, like you would do on bare metal? HA provides several images, although not for proxmox. However, you can take the Virtualbox-image and convert that to proxmox. Look here:\n\n[https://www.calidade.systems/en/2019/08/04/moving-a-virtual-machine-from-virtualbox-to-proxmox/](https://www.calidade.systems/en/2019/08/04/moving-a-virtual-machine-from-virtualbox-to-proxmox/)\n\nIf you take the Home assistant Operating System version for linux, virtualbox:\n\n[https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/linux](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/linux)\n\nAnd convert that to proxmox, you have HA OS running native in a proxmox-container. Problem solved. :)\n\nGood luck from another dinosaur :-)",

            "Nice, I did see zig bee as an alternative to wifi when I was trying to learn the basics and that sounds like the way to go. And HA seems to come up a fair bit too, so at least as a step 2,sounds like what I should look for to play around with\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to help me out",
            "Gateways are called coordinators in HA?\n\n\\>...on Home Assistant and on NodeRed addon.\n\naddons are called integrations too?\n\n\\>My recommendation for you would be to search for the devices which use zigbee (not WiFi) and are being able to communicate without access to cloud.\n\nI thought ANY zigbee device (\"as long as that module/adapter is compatible with zigpy lib\") for example, could be paired with one of vendor\\_agnostic radios as u called it? And paired with HA and ZHE integration, it could be operated offcloud?\n\nquoting doesn't seem to work for me",
            "It's seems like there are options, there seems to be a couple of different protocols that smart bulbs can run on, and then there are a few apps to choose from depending...\n\nBut that's as far as I have gotten so far, don't know the names or anything, need to post and ask once I reviver from Christmas hahaha",
            "I have installed HA in a Proxmox container, but have had mixed results. The networking seems to be rather flakey. A Debian 11 VM is my latest install and I followed the instructions on installing the core and supervisor. I'm not sure supervisor is a good thing. And the \"store\" is kind of a joke since it just installs docker stuff. I think I'm going back to a simple core install and put the \"HCS\" stuff in containers. I use Node-Red more than I want, but putting under the HCS umbrella is just too complex. Proxmox containers are much easier to manage since you have direct control over the image.\n\nI have finally built a \"home-brew\" ESPHome clone that works on either Arduino or Raspberry PI. I need that because some of my outbuildings are steel and don't play nicely with WiFi. The MQTT configuration message is very picky and it took several hours of head-scratching to get everything recognized by HA. \n\nDinosaurs still kick butt!",
            "There is an IRC gateway for gitter: https://irc.gitter.im/",
            "I don't know how to quote either ;-)\n\nGateway is a coordinator. So in my case Conbee II.\nAnything which is connected to the power (like a lightbulb or a plug) is a zigvee router and anything else is a end device.\n\nIntegrations is something different than addon - i have Universal controller (Logitech Harmony) which is integrated with HA out of the box. Aldona is something which you need to install well, in addition :-)\n\nAny zigbee device could be added to the network but not everything works as easy as in case of WiFi & cloud devices. It took me few hours to set the conditions for my motion sensor and light bulbs to work the way I wanted.\n\nBut now even without Internet my lights are switching on when the movement is detected and Christmas lights turn on when it's getting dark outside."

I love being a power user and using Rpis, but man I wish I could just buy something (even if its more expensive) to replace the ease of google home, and have it in stock.\n\nGet the hardware down, add timers and the ability for assist devices to play music on spotify (or wherever) and I am switching no question.",

I have not seen a project that goes \"we are going to do x\" and then easily, measurably, consistently does so.  \nI religiously check for the latest version and am always excited by what's new. Thank you for making such a brilliant and open-standard product!",

Things like asking it to \u201cturn off the hall light\u201d was interpreted as \u201cturn off the whole light\u201d. \n\nIn regards to point on security, I hope that means they\u2019re interested in adding support for IdM\u2019s like Entra so external logins can be protected by conditional access policies",
            "definitely want to +1 for the dashboards to have definable permissions for users and guests. I'd really like visitors to my home to have a landing page when they connect to the wifi that tells them how to adjust stuff in their room and see temperatures and things. It should be a customized dashboard that I've made just for guests and they shouldn't be able to get to anything else. Also, this would be even more important for people have short-term rentals like airbnb homes - when a guest comes into the home and connects to wifi, they could be shown a customized dashboard with all the things they need, including the checkout instructions, and not be able to get to anything else in home assistant. And lastly, I think it would be very useful to give kids a dashboard for their controls without them having the ability to get to anything else other than what is on their dashboard. Just some basic permissions settings on dashboard pages would allow for all of these use cases and people could get really creative with them. Thanks HA!",

When changes are made in the UI, they are automatically put into the text file(s). Your text file is checked and loaded in on startup or by reloading the components. \n\nI get that it's a lot more work and brings with it its own sort of issues, but having a config file that has all your stuff could be great for debugging issues in forums. Setting up new HA instances (for others) that have some features you know are going to work out of the box makes setting up easier. When doing stuff for my parents I often have forgotten some small things in the UI you have to do, which this would fix.\n\nOverall it's a small issue and I'm happy that I chose HA over OpenHub, because every thing I thought would be nice in a smart home is something HA got pretty fast.",

From what I know, most (maybe all?) of the Nabu Casa people are from outside the US and maybe also from non-English native countries. \n\nTo elaborate for everyone - in my experience with English, the word \"home\" is most often used to refer to the location of / the physical structure of the house itself. If you want to refer to the *people* who live in the house, the word commonly used is \"household.\" So saying that your \"home\" approves of something carries the connotation that it is the approval of the structure itself that you are worried about. Household would be a more fitting word when referring to the approval of the occupants of the house themselves.\n\nHowever, another way to look at the phrase \"home approval factor\" is that rather than getting the approval *from* the home, you are getting the approval from everyone else *about* the home. \n\nThis kinda is just splitting hairs about language but hey, what better time to be pedantic about language than when using it for marketing.\n\n/u/Ksevio  I think you're getting such a negative reaction to this comment because as Nabu Casa and others have been moving away from gender-specific phrases like \"wife approval factor\" and toward more inclusive phrases, there has been some unpleasantness from people... let's say reacting negatively. I think your comment got misinterpreted as being from that crowd.",

I feel like the intent of it (being the approval factor of everyone in the home - Guests, spouse, kids, pets, etc) translates fine into other languages. Even shortening your suggestion down to \"Household Approval Factor\" cuts out the fact that you are probably going to have guests at your house and you want it to function correctly for them too.\n\nTL;Dr: basically what the other guy said.
