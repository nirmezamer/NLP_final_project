            "Looking to buy my first \"nice\" watch. I normally wear an Apple Watch every day, but I'd like to get a nice automatic watch to wear for client visits (I work in tech and would wear with a blazer) and weddings (would wear with a suit). I tried watches on in a few different boutiques recently (Tudor, Tag, Breitling) and really liked the look and feel of the Tag Heuer Carrera Date in black/rose gold (WBN2113.BA0639). I especially liked the simplicity of the look with minimal complications. Could that watch serve my purpose? I don't have a specific budget in mind, but I'm seeing that model on Chrono24 and eBay for under $3k, which I'm comfortable with. Reading through the buying guides, I'm a bit overwhelmed with the amount of options. I'd also like to get a black leather strap for it but am not sure of the best place to do so.",
            "How idiotic will I look if I wear a smart watch on one wrist and a Rolex on the other?",

            "I would like to find an automatic vintage pre-1969 Hamilton watch that would have been made in Lancaster, Pennsylvania to use as an heirloom piece. Where is the best place to look?",
            "I'm looking for my first nice watch, and landed on the YEMA Navygraf Marine Nationale GMT as one of my options. From what I've seen, Yema has had pretty bad QC from a year or 2 ago. Is this still the case? Would the Yema be worth the risk of bad quality?",
            "Can anyone recommend a company that makes quality straps?  My Omega AT has 16mm between lugs and the official Omega straps have only a few options.",
            "Hey all,\n\nJust curious, I want a hand-winding (not automatic) watch with a glass case back. My price range is up to $2000. Open to suggestions, preferably a field watch but really anything.\n\nThank you!",

            "Ok, I worry this isn't going to go over well, but I have no choice. I recently saw a watch I loved on the subway, but I couldn't read the brand from where I was. I'm going to describe everything I can about the watch, and you tell me if you have ANY IDEA what it might be. \n\nIt was a round steel-colored case on a blue rubber-looking strap. The face was flat white, and the only Arabic numerals were 3, 6, 9, and 12, in a modern-looking font. Other than that the face was pretty plain - it didn't look like it had a lot going on, but there was definitely a spot of red that might have been part of the logo and might not. The second hand was red. Overall size I would guess 30-40MM.\n\nI know, it's not a lot to work with. But any ideas?",
            "Just another person seeking out come potential recs/guidance. Does anyone have any experience with Nighthawk Ecodrives (the all black variant) some reviews mention the finish wearing off somewhat quick and the lack of luminous hands a real challenge.\n\nIdeally looking for a 40-42 mm watch that is mostly black and durable, analog, and ideally has a cloth or mesh band. I don't have any sort of preference on movement, especially as I'm trying to stay under $300 for a first nice watch. The nighthawk is over my budget but that mostly black look \ud83e\udd24. I had been considering Omega Swatches but am concerned about their durability as an every day bike commuter. Thanks!",

            "I've never been much a of watch person but my Dad bought me this all black Citizen that I honestly really lke the look of. It just seems pretty large for my wrist and slides all the way down my wrist while my arm is at my side. Does this watch just not fit me? Or is this how watches are supposed to rest on your wrist? I got a few bands removed by the person at the watch store and they said they took off as much as they could. Pics of me wearing it: https://imgur.com/a/OLhB2nu\n\nThanks",

I have heard that importing a watch with a value above $2,500 makes the process more time consuming, complicated and costly. Does anyone know if the value is determined before or after sales tax?

Great condition apart from a minor scratch on the clasp. Only reason I'm selling is it was a wedding present from my 1st wife and I no longer want it. \n\nI've tried watchfinder but the offer they made was insulting (less than a 3rd of the original value), they even admitted it was a poor offer compared to selling privately.",
            "Hey folks,\n\nI\u2019m in the market for the next piece in my collection, and as of late, I\u2019ve fallen in love with the idea of adding a bronze watch to the roundup. Something that would patina nice, but still have a bit of character and be able to hold up to daily use. \n\nSome of the watches I\u2019ve been considering are the: \n- Christopher Ward C60 Pro 300 Bronze\n- Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical Bronze\n- And potentially something with Oris\u2019 Big Hand lineup. \n\nStill trying to iron out the budget, but does anyone have any experience with these or could offer any other recommendations to consider?",

            "Given your wear occasions it sounds like dress watch might serve you better than a all occasion watch like the Carrera, but Carrera isn't a bad option. Tag Heuer had a bad reputation for being the mall watch brand, but it's been doing well recovering from that poor reputation in the last few years.\n\nPersonally, I would prefer the recently released Longines Conquest over the Carrera. I think it looks better and I like the brand better too. But it's more of a personal preference thing.\n\nIf we are going with dress watch then there is a lot of different options out there. Personally I'd lean towards Carl F. Bucherer Manero AutoDate because it looks nice and it's the John Wick's watch. Longines also has a lot of good dress watches and their sector dial and silver arrow would be worth giving a look as well.",

            "I might be wrong, but I believe mechanical moonphase is rather complicated and consequently requires more parts leading to bigger movement. Complication adds cost(non Chinese requirement just added to that cost), and bigger movement move most of these watches out of women's category. That's probably the reason for the struggle.",

No.\n\nAt this point the PRX is just too well established as the darling of the integrated bracelet world, and I would hazard that most of the people into this style will have long since bought in, so there won't be a huge market left over for the Citizen as it wont be a choice between a Citizen or Tissot, but between buying a new Citizen and the Tissot you already own...\n\nThe Tissot also has the tagline of 'Swiss made', which while realistically meaningless here, does sound good... As great as they may be, it is always going to be hard selling 'Japanese made' over 'Swiss made'.\n\nOf the two watches though, my choice would absolutely be for the Citizen, for the simple reason that I like the design better.",

            "You know that it's possible to have knowledge about other people's opinions without holding those opinions yourself right? It's not difficult, try it out.\n\nPeople buy the PRX because it is a swiss made watch, with a swiss automatic movement, for about the same money as a basic Seiko. Whether people are right or wrong about their decision, or their reasons, that's why they sell in their millions. The existence of a different Japanese watch in the same bracket won't change their mind and 'kill' the PRX.",
            "You're trying to speak for everyone when you only own gumball machine watches yourself. Seiko as a brand has far more prestige and respect than companies cranking out budget watches with outsourced movements. I guess GS, Credor, Lange, GO, and all the other top tier Japanese and German brands that make their own in house movements should start ordering some cheap off shelf eta movements so they can impress all the randos who dont buy nice watches or know anything. \n\nNo ones said anythings going to \"kill\" the PRX. My friend has one and its nice for the price and will continue to thrive as a budget Royal Oak.",

That is what my entire comment is about...all the reasons why it absolutely is not and never will be a PRX killer.\n\nNobody is talking about any of what you are talking about. Of course there exist better watches than the PRX. Maybe even this Citizen is. That's not the point. People buying the PRX don't care about the quality of the movement in that or any other watch. They don't care about whether a 30k GS is a better watch than most Swiss watches or whether the Germans are also capable of making good watches. They don't care about any of what you're saying. They are buying the PRX because they believe that they are getting a good Swiss watch for a bargain price. This Citizen is not going to change that opinion for them. I'm not sure why this is a difficult concept for you to grasp.",
            "Seems like you're the one who cant read. I said from the outset I agree that its not a PRX killer and just disagree with blindly d riding anything swiss. You keep speaking for everyone like you're an authority on the matter when you barely know anything and can barely speak for yourself. Quit window shopping and go buy one if theyre that great. You can tell everyone you meet that its nice cause it was mass produced Swiss."

The squircle case shape, strikingly simple dial and unique typeface comes together so perfectly. To me it\u2019s almost a modern take on a classic field watch.\n\nAfter digging into this more, I found out that it actually has an in-house movement that is manufactured by the famous Vaucher Manufacture Fleurier that makes movements for AP, Richard Mille, and many more. The H08 is MUCH more than just another fashion watch.\n\nHerm\u00e8s actually acquired a 25% stake in Vaucher years ago which absolutely sealed the deal for me and I had to pick up an H08. Herm\u00e8s is in it for the long run and this is their first men\u2019s sports watch which I believe will be a future classic.\n\nReally enjoying this piece! Let me know what you guys think!",
