        "content": "Folks, a reminder that [Rule 3](/r/offmychest/about/rules) focuses this community's scope on providing emotional support only. We do not allow solicitation or material offers.\n\nThis means OPs cannot hint at or ask for money, and community members cannot offer money or food. There are local services that can verify and address a person's situation better than any of us can (and many services will not turn people away if they are asking for it). A kind community member offered a scammer a job and that is okay.\n\nThis community is read by millions of people, and scammers around the world know this. We have cultivated an empathic community so we know it can be hard to resist offering material help. It takes only one person to make it worth it because it costs nothing to post. That is why the rules are strictly enforced.\n\nThere are many signs of a scammer. They will present a financially desperate situation often with a highly emotional component. They are likely to mention payment services. They may have payment services in their Reddit profile and ask people to look at their profile. They will ask people to privately message them. All of these behaviors may be obfuscated with weird spacing and other ways to evade detection. If they evade detection it's up to the community to report it. Do not call out OPs, report only.\n\nThank you for your cooperation.",

My daughter responded to a Facebook posting for a rental and it was a scam. She online called the person out and then through messenger the person threaten to murder her and her Family. Put pictures of family members into the Facebook message.  It was reported to Facebook yet there\u2019s been no action and I honestly I\u2019m just disgusted on all levels angry and scared. I feel like I need an Uber geek\u2026.. yeah I\u2019m so burnt out probably going to go off Facebook and I told her to also. Yet there\u2019s a couple of groups that I really want to be part of so I\u2019m just treading water at this time.  I am actually quite scared, this person may just be a scammer from another country yet the violence threatening to kill her father,  sister and other family members was a little bit over the top and they posted pictures of these family members.  Again Facebook did not respond. I asked Facebook to deactivate the persons profile and they said no reason to, it was OK.  Thanks for your patience and reading this to whoever did.

For instance getting on an elevator with a male stranger that makes you uncomfortable because you don't want to seem rude he points out what's sillier waiting a moment for the next elevator or getting into a soundproof steal box with a stranger you are afraid of.

Our relatives, friends, and even my parents in the past have made a point of pointing out that I am the \"smarter\" sister and my sister is the \"prettier sister.\"\n\nIt hurts me deeply because everyone somehow believes that just because I get to be \"smarter,\" I must not have an interest in being pretty, either. I feel like a troll standing next to my sister, and all I can do is bite my lips and nod in agreement when people pass comments like \"your sister looks like an angel.\"\n\nThe only thing I have is that I am skinnier. But ever since my sister has developed an eating disorder, I feel a lot of pressure in also restricting my diet. It's so exhausting .. I don't know how to just \"accept\" that she is pretty, and will be prettier than me. I have fears that my future partner will make a comment in his head that I am the less hotter one -- or that anyone I actually choose to pursue may want my sister first (which, consequently, has happened before). \n\nI do my best to accept the hand I was dealt.

I also became smart (have two Science UG degrees and halfway through a PG med degree). \n\nI also want to say that asymmetry is much more interesting than symmetry IMO. The little quirks are what makes you stand out and what I find beautiful.\n\nCultivate your self-confidence, work on your personality, and your kindness and your empathy. These are the things that people are going to notice about you and these are the things that are going to make you even more beautiful in someone\u2019s eyes.",

But be truthful with yourself and don't compare.  There are millions of people on this planet who are likely prettier than you and me.  How nice for them!

        "content": "My 40ish year old sister lived in a city bordering a US state with her 2 children and once deported husband. One day she fell ill and had to be transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia and was in the ICU for about a little over a month in critical condition. This was early 2021 in the midst of pandemic restrictions. \n\nShe then is in remission and discharged and begins to receive treatment at a cancer facility in the US, so she and her 2 kids (who are finishing up the school year online) began living at our parents\u2019 house in the US to get her treatment meanwhile her husband was to stay in his home country. Because traveling and chemo were so hard on her body, long trips were not possible so over the course of these 10 months their communication was pretty much limited to over the phone.\n\nFollowing a failed bone marrow transplant and relapse after relapse, she made the decision to not continue chemotherapy and let the cancer take its course and passed just shy of Christmas of 2021. She made us promise that no matter what, we would always put her children first.\n\nBy the end of February we find out that her husband was dating and wanted to introduce his girlfriend to their children. Now, I am aware that people grieve differently and it\u2019s possible he just moved on a long time ago blah blah blah but my sister had a feeling that during the middle of all of this that he was cheating on her (emotionally at least) which turned out to be true. His new GF was an old high school flame who tried time and time again to come between them during the almost 20 years of their marriage. But alas, it is his business what he does with his life. \n\nNow what IS our business: about a month after her passing, he completely abandoned his children both emotionally and financially. One of the kids was about to begin college and the other was still in high school and he just cut off all support and pretty much all communication to dedicate his time to his new family (the lady has 2 children who he boasts about on social media). His biological children receive absolutely no financial help from him (in fact he has asked THEM for money) and rarely, MAYBE twice a year reaches out to them. He hasn\u2019t wished them a happy birthday this past year as we\u2019ve just recently come to find out. \n\nI absolutely HATE him. It is an absolute DREADFUL weight to carry but this just feels like a betrayal to not only my sister but their kids, ESPECIALLY their kids. I know it is impossible to force him to be a father but all that\u2019s left to say is what the hell?! When she was alive, honestly, he seemed like the perfect husband and father. I know that I shouldn\u2019t \u201cforgive for him but for my peace of mind\u201d but how the hell do you even go about beginning to forgive something like this?!",

            "He doesn\u2019t deserve forgiveness, Let that man go be a deadbeat. focus all your energy & support on the kids.",
            "I'm so sorry for your loss. Are the kids okay? Are they able to stay in college and figure out a way to pay for their educations?",
            "I wouldn't forgive him. He sounds like a scumbag to abandon his own children.",
            "I'm so sorry for the loss of your sister.  She and you sound like genuine, caring people with beautiful hearts.  Otherwise, you wouldn't be so outraged at your ex-BIL's gross behavior.\n\nThose almost-adult kids ended up losing both their parents, which is tragic.  It takes a hard, hard heart to just decide your own children don't matter anymore, especially when you're the only parent those kids have left.  That's going to bite him later, when he's older and finds he needs them.  Those kids are going to turn their backs on him and tell him to go ask his new family for that mess.\n\nForgiveness?  Sometimes that's not the best route.  Sometimes the best route is to scream your rage into the void, rant about the unfairness of it all, cry about it...Then pick yourself up and do what you need to do to help the situation.  You can't control those kids' father, but you can control your reaction to him.  But you can't control it until you first deal with it.  It's apparent to me you're still grieving, both for your sister and for the terrible situation thanks to your sister's ex.  And once you deal with those feelings, you're going to find that you just don't care about him.  And your niece and nephew need their family.  If their dad isn't man enough to do it, then family needs to step up to do it.   It doesn't have to be money, sometimes just the emotional support, just the knowing you aren't going to abandon them the way their dad did, is what they desperately need.\n\nSo yeah, go ahead and hate the guy.  He deserves it.  And you'll know when the anger has served its purpose, and it's time for you to move on.  It's just that the time is not now.",

            "I was never a fan of the idea you have to forgive everyone, personally. I would hate him too. I *do* hate him on behalf of all those he's affected. \n\nI think with time, instead of forgiving him, you can learn to not dwell on him and his decisions. If not for you then so you can help the kids do the same. It has to be eating at them. \n\nI am so sorry for your loss and that it's been magnified by his actions. I hope you and the kids live your best lives going forward as best you can, I'm sure that's what your sister would have wanted.",
            "This is awful and infuriating and it's not even my family. I'm so sorry for the loss of your sister and most especially the loss of her children's mother. Their father abandoning them is cruel. I have zero advice on forgiving him because in your place, I would never be able to.",
            "Make sure those kids know their worth and their loved. Sounds like you are. Thank God.  Forgiveness is for you not that pos. You will find freedom from the bondage of hatred. By watching you, those wonderful children will see how to be loving and fulfilled adults.",
            "I am sorry for your loss. He is grieving by running away from his responsibilities, and he is going to regret it when his kids move on without him. \n\nYou and the rest of your family keep supporting and loving the kids. They need someone after so much loss. \n\nI hope your sister rests in peace knowing you will care for them.",
            "I happen to love \ud83d\udc08 ass ideas but you\u2019re dead on here. \n\nAnger gets shit done. \n\nNo other emotion in life has served me more than anger. \nGreat for chores, for camping, for dealing with a mthfkr. \n\nThere is nothing anger can\u2019t help you accomplish.",

        "content": "So, for context my husband (41m) and I (40f) have both had back injuries. I went to PT for my (several) injuries and got better. I worked my body back from pregnancies and now I am a body builder. \nMy husband on the other hand spent the last 20 years avoiding work. \"I can't mow the lawn I might hurt my back, even though you're pregnant you have to do it cause you're smaller than me you won't get hurt as easily\" \ud83d\ude44 \"I can't help with the kids, I might hurt my back\" \"I can't clean the garage I might hurt my back\" (those are some of the things he would say almost daily. I did hurt my back doing those things. As a 4'11 woman and he a 6'3 man he always put much more burden on me than he was willing to take on himself.\n\nFast-forward to last year his disks start breaking down and he has constant pain. So then he helps even LESS than before. Around the same time my back was injured from doing the things that had to be done that he never tried to help with. \nWe both signed up for PT. I went every week and did the workouts at home. He went once and gave up. \nMy back got better his didn't. \n\nI lost 20 lbs and turned my body into solid muscle, my 18 year old body building son became my coach. I've always loved fitness but after my twins were born 6 years ago it was so hard to find time to work out effectively especially with my husband not wanting to be active in taking care of the twins. \"You're breastfeeding and they only want you so I can't help you.\" \n\nHis back got worse and worse to the point where he couldn't bend over at all. \n\nWe consulted a surgeon and his surgery was supposed to be two days ago.\n\nAs they were prepping him for surgery he decided he didn't want it and walked out. He claims he's not in \"as much\" pain and that for the next year or two he has to \"keep doing what I've been doing\" (which means not helping with kids or house at all) and that somehow is going to make him better. He's also not willing to join the gym or go to PT.\n\nIt seems like he really just wants to use it as an excuse and I'm so over it. I'm already doing everything myself why should I be carrying around his dead weight too? \n\nYesterday I was showing off my progress, wearing pants two sizes smaller than last year and muscle definition in my whole body and while I was excitedly bouncing around in my smaller clothes he asked if I was drunk and told me I look silly. I told him I don't really care what he thinks anymore. Not gonna let him put me down and mock me for working on myself while he sits on his behind doing nothing. \n\n",

            "Hey OP-just out of curiosity, does husband take painkillers? This happened with my brother. He had terrible pain, slipped discs, herniation, spinal stenosis. He works, though, and he\u2019s a sheet metal journeyman, so he would just pop pills and grind through the pain.\u00a0\n\n\nHe finally had scheduled surgery, and a few days before, I took him up to a pre-op check, they did blood testing and explained the surgery and post-op care. They told him that he\u2019d be getting a stronger oxycodone to add to his pain medication regimen for a short period of time (I think he was on 7.5/325 and they gave him 15mg instant for a week). They said after, his surgeon expected him to begin to taper from his then-daily dosage of 6 pills/day within a few weeks, and at his 6-week post-op, they expected him to be off opiates entirely, as long as the surgery went well and he attended PT.\u00a0\n\n\nHe stood up, put on his coat and hat, and interrupted the nurse and said \u201cyou can go ahead and cancel the surgery\u201d \u00a0and he gave me a little wave and nodded toward the door. I didn\u2019t understand, so he just said \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the car\u201d and walked out. The nurse said she saw it all the time-people who are prescribed opiates long-term (not abusing them, just taking them for months) refuse surgery or any track that might cause them to be taken off them, because it\u2019s the only way they can function. She said once your doctor decides you should be off them, you can\u2019t get another prescription easily, and at least 1/3 of her pre-op appointments ended this way. She said he was likely worried that he couldn\u2019t work without opiate pain relief. Long story short-she was right.\n\n\nIf he currently takes pain pills, quietly track how much he\u2019s taking-count his pills and check in a day, then two, see how he\u2019s doing on his schedule. If he\u2019s sticking to his schedule, ask him what his plan is long-term. Most docs won\u2019t keep you on them for years. If he\u2019s refusing surgery, they may take him off now, because opiates are supposed to be helping to get him through the day until his surgery is complete and he\u2019s healing-it\u2019s not a long-term solution.\u00a0\n\n\nI wouldn\u2019t call his doctor or anything yet-just keep an eye on it and see if that could be it. Just a heads up-if you discuss him potentially abusing them to his doc and he isn\u2019t actually abusing them, they may flag him as a potential opiate abuser anyway and stop his medication, and that can follow him around to other doctors. Just make sure he\u2019s taking them safely! My brother wasn\u2019t, and he hit rock bottom very hard within a year of that canceled surgery. I should\u2019ve paid attention to what the nurse said. I hope if that\u2019s the issue, this will help you.",

His last surgery is unfortunately causing more damage that will eventually have to be addressed but he\u2019s still trying and he gets angry about being limited.

That\u2019s wicked awesome!! Clear your life of your extra child. Or sit him down and clearly state what you expect of him. Or else. I found in a marriage they don\u2019t seem to listen, in this type of situation, until they hear WHAT will happen by WHEN is they don\u2019t do WHAT. And stick to that. Our kids see everything and learn from that and bring it into their life practice. I wish I could have changed so many things sooner for the 2 kids I gave birth to-Due to the third child that metamorphosed into another child to care for (the sperm donor I married) I\u2019m sorry that wicked sucks- But I am glad for your strength and building healthy bonds with your kids.

There is a HUGE new life out here when we don\u2019t have the burden of ALSO caring for their messes and also their weighing presence in your life. \nHe needs to go away and take care of himself for a while- and then when visitation happens he will REALLY see how much you do\u2026. \nI\u2019m proud of you OP!!

Idk your history, but before checking out of your marriage,  there could be a legit underlying reason that he hasn't had surgery that has zero to do with being lazy. \n\nPain is often a cause for depression.  That alone does a number on a person. It also can cause a person more pain through a phantom pain syndrome on top of the pain increasing as the body weakens. \n\nSeeing what's going on with you and no doubt feeling you exiting your relationship will kick up the depression and anxiety or make it worse.  He could've been depressed all along and watching your success while he feels he hasn't improved (even if he isn't trying hard) can tank him too. Depression is a liar, theif and destroyer.\n\nThere's just a ton of speculations out there but if love him outside of how you perceive he's not helping himself,  don't walk away and trash that commitment without finding out if it's depression strangling him and your relationship.  \n\n\nSource: been there from pain and rebuilding life.",

He could also be a lazy piece of shit using his condition as an excuse to get out of doing work. Hell, it could be all of those. \n\nI'll say this though: it's hard for a lot of people to face reality. Especially when that reality involves their health. I've always thought it was weird as hell that people know more about their stupid ass hobbies than they know about their own bodies. I'm just as guilty. I can talk to someone for hours about video games or fishing but I couldn't tell you how lungs turn oxygen into blood. Hell, I'm not even sure if this is how it works. We all have a body and we only get the one but we don't know shit about it. And if it starts breaking down we either want to learn more about it, like you did, or we want to know even less in order to avoid harsh truths, like your husband did. \n\nOnly you know what's best for you and it can be exceptionally frustrating dealing with an unwell person who doesn't do anything to get better. But try to understand why exactly that person is avoiding things. But at the end of the day you have to do what you think is best for you.

He got mad about you being excited about an accomplishment because he's disgusting and selfish. Ditch him and go enjoy your life, you deserve it. Congratulations on your accomplishments.",
            "Yes divorce! The funny thing to me is in one way or another this is the life so many women live. If the husband isn\u2019t willing to do therapy or help themselves I would divorce in a heartbeat. He hasn\u2019t kept his vows for a long time.",

You can do so much better. \n\nAlternatively, if you are not completely fed up with him and his lack of willingness to live life threaten him with divorce and make him seek help for depression because it sounds like he's depressed. I was kind of like your husband until I received TMS therapy - It is a new transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy that targets certain brain areas to completely eliminate depression and anxiety with just a few therapy sessions. I felt sluggish, I felt pain, I felt unmotivated and depressed... After three sessions I am a new person.",

But we just tried to play pickleball the other day for the first time and he surprised me and wanted to play. He of course was so damn good but he couldn't run for the balls or squat low or move quickly at all. I almost cried watching him struggle to play bc it really brought it home how much he has declined bc he refused the surgery in 2018. \n\nI can't imagine how much of an actual drag he will be then.",

He probably is using his back pain as an excuse to get out of doing things . the fact that he walked out without getting the surgery is probably more than just wanting to continue to be lazy, maybe he\u2019s just really scared. Surgery is very scary. I\u2019ve had two major back surgeries and two knee replacements and I\u2019m only in my 40s. The reason I did it was so I could be more involved in my son\u2019s life and in life in general, I got tired of being in pain all the time.

Would claim his SPINE is messed up and his legs could go out anytime and he is in pain. We had 3 kids close together and at Disney when our very small children would be crying and tired in line wanting held, he bitterly griped about his spine and it was me that always carried them even when too big to carry. I have a collapsed disc in my lower back so it wasn't easy. We are divorced. He got himself 2 new giant dogs.....that he walks everyday. Makes me furious. Also him using the word spine dramatically was so gross. I am so so sorry about your husband. I would say divorce but first think about how custody could go and if he will go for 50/50 and if you think  you are OK with that and if that is best for the kids. I really struggle with how hard it's been on my kids and I have them most of the time. Maybe let him know if he fails to do what is required this time then in 6 months or whatever time you are done.

Knowing that he could not hear me and I was basically living with someone who did know I was present half the time.

Good parents switch off on care, they make sure each other have breaks, and they try to have an equitable amount of \"on\" hours. The SAHP parent is still working that whole time the other parent is at work. They chose to have kids together -- if she left to go to work, over the years that would be daycare/childcare for four different kids. Do you understand how much money is saved that way?\n\nOP isn't describing someone who wants to have a video game night once a week, she's describing someone who has not done a single bit of work over the years.

How can someone look back at their relationship and say they\u2019ve gotten nothing tangible out of it when they got to see everything for their children? That\u2019s a gift as far as I\u2019m concerned. \n\nDo I understand the financial ramifications of a stay at home parent in that it kind of equates to a second job in the household when you consider how much money is saved on child care?

I think anyone would progressively more frustrated if they had to do everything alone because their partner males excuses to not help. He's INTENTIONALLY not getting better because he wants any excuse to not help her. That's weaponized incompetence.\n\nMy dad makes a good amount of money (my mother too) yet he still raised his children, bonded with us, and helped us anytime we needed it. This is a sorry excuse of a father if he doesn't involve himself in his children's needs because he dumps it on his wife. Growing up, my parents BOTH made the effort to go to my extracurricular events, my dad took care of the  kids while my mother recovered from giving birth to us. This dude made OP be the only one to get up every single night and do all the diaper changing and breastfeeding.",
            "Sounds like someone who has never taken care of a kid. It absolutely is stress-inducing, especially if you are raising twins functionally alone. Do you think it is pleasant and relaxing when one baby is crying to be fed but refusing to latch on, and the other has a full diaper? You know what ideally happens in that situation? The other parent steps in to help. \n\nAnd in case you're having trouble with the OP, her issue isn't just childcare. It's that she is going everything else for the household. He doesn't clean, doesn't do other chores, leaves messes behind. So OP is raising the kids alone, but also doing all the basic things an adult would be doing if they were living alone for her and her husband."

            "She needs to relax. She needs a combination of relaxing and exciting stimuli. Try using incense or other scents if she\u2019s into them, not too much. Make sure the room is a comfortable temperature. Make sure the room is neat and tidy. Put down a towel so she\u2019s not worried about making a mess. Get the lighting right - usually this means a little dim but not dark, so use a table/desk lamp to get it right if you have to. If it relaxes her, put on some music - quietly. Spend time making her *body* feel comfortable and nice - gentle massage is a good one to try. A little lube on the inside and/or neutral massage oil on the outside can help her feel like she doesn\u2019t have to stop herself letting go and making a mess. Verbal reassurance and telling her how much what *she* is doing is turning *you* on helps.\n\nShe needs to be comfortable and relaxed - think of it like getting ready for sleep, trying to balance the excitement and arousal with relaxation. Don\u2019t let the two of you get too focused on her orgasming as a goal - the goal is for her to feel good.\n\nSet some words for her to use when she\u2019s ready to slow down so you don\u2019t have to come to a cold stop. \u201cThank you honey\u201d is a good one - so you can slowly step back from sexual stuff back to massage and cuddling.\n\nGood luck!",
            "As a mature woman, I'm 55, I know young women can have a lot of hang-ups. The conversations I have had with hundreds of them tell me they overthink everything. Their concerns many times are totally unfounded: things that can run through their minds are, is my body ugly?, are my tits too flabby, is my tummy too thick, are my labia ugly?, do I smell and taste funny down there?, coukd he be comparing me with a past gf, are the bjs I give trash?, is my ass too big?, etc the list can be long. Social media and porn can highlight feelings of insecurity. They like to compare themselves with other girls. They need to relax!! Relax! Learn to help her feel relaxed. Sex should not be a race to reach climax either. Explore what feels good to her, especially when it comes to stimulating the clit with either her or your fingers or using a vibrating toy during penetrative sex. Take your time. Slow and steady is king when you're exploring your bodies.",
            "Maybe tell her to fantasize or focus on what turns her on the most",
            "I had something like this. It might be a subconscious mental barrier. What helped me was feeling desired. Like my bf moaning at my touch and telling me how bad he wants me. Men moaning is such a huge turn on. So it may be just finding what makes hers feel so desired and comfortable that she\u2019ll eventually get there. Sometimes it\u2019s unlearning lessons taught when you were growing up and just about feeling free and what you\u2019re doing is right.",
            "I would agree that it\u2019s a mental thing, unluckily one that is probably getting worse, the more you actively try to get it done. While for men the climax is almost all about the body or the \u201emechanics\u201c for women it\u2019s often a fairly even split between mental aspect and physical stimulation. Obviously any sort of pressure is thus counterproductive. That\u2019s why sex usually is way better when both partners can just turn off their head. It\u2019s also (imo) the reason why the most common dynamic in bed is the woman as submissive part and the man as dominant one, that takes charge, simply for the reason that the submissive part usually doesn\u2019t have to think or worry as much about what comes next, what they\u2019re supposed to do, etc. They can let themselves go, which often times is more important for women than for men, due to aforementioned reason. \n\nIn a way the more emphasis you put on her orgasm, the more pressure there is for her to \u201cperform\u201d or get it done, and thus making it less likely. Counterintuitively maybe the best thing, would be to therefore focus less on her orgasm, at least at the forefront of things, and rather focus on yourself more. Like the mindset should not be that you\u2019re like \u201cokay now I try to and expect to make you cum\u201d, but more of you doing whatever you want to do (which hopefully includes her pleasure though). I\u2019m not trying my best to make her cum, I\u2019m doing what *I* want to do and if she cums in the process that\u2019s great, but I put neither pressure on her, nor on myself to make it happen. Hopefully this makes some sort of sense.",

After me and my gf spent time and time thinking to make it happen, in the end it happened in the most random ways like we didn't even think about it. It was spontaneous, natural. And I think this is the key. \nWe have stereotypes from Porn that we need to let it go. Sex and Love is another thing personally. Everyone is  different and everyone has their time to develop awareness to certain type of things . \n\nAs you describe seems like you have an amazing sex life. Just enjoy it as already is and eventually, will happen one day :)",

I'm only assuming based on it not being directly mentioned in your post, but if you aren't already, it's worth getting better acquainted with Mr. Clitoris too.\n\nGetting frustrated and pressuring yourselves to get there will just make it harder to get there together though, take it easy, be patient and don't try to force it.",
            "Slow down a little and get away from the daily sex. She may be feeling like she has to put out to keep you happy and that\u2019s putting a lot of pressure and stress on her.",

Maybe focus a bit more on exploring her body and sensual things like massaging/caressing her body. Just enjoy each other without expectations. \n\nAlso, a little bit next level, you could ask her if she has any kinks? I personally come so much easier if I'm psychologically dominated or if there's a bit of pain mixed into the pleasure. Being pinned down especially sets me at ease and relaxes me so long as i already feel safe and desired. THIS IS ONLY APPLICABLE TO ME PERSONALLY, DONT TAKE THIS AS A TODO LIST. Talk to her about things you both might be interested in exploring. \n\nAnother more risque thing to explore may be blindfolding her, and have her use her toys in front of you. A scary and vulnerable concept, but may help her to focus on her own pleasure with you present.",
