Please be sure to read the thread rules and follow them so your post is not removed.\n\n## Rules\n\n1. You **MUST give meaningful feedback on at least TWO (2) other posts in the thread BEFORE you post**, or if you are the *first or second* commenter you must post your two feedback comments within ONE (1) hour. Any violations will be treated as Hit and Runs and removed without notice.\n2. The thread is kept on Contest Mode to ensure you always have an equal opportunity to be viewed!\n3. If a Moderator sees that you have not given any feedback, your post will be removed.\n4. If you post feedback on somebody's YouTube page directly, leave a comment in this thread telling him/her that you did so.  This way, a Moderator does not mistakenly assume you didn't give feedback.  Do keep in mind that many users may not like getting Feedback on their YouTube page, because it may look bad to their audience.\n5. Saying \"it's good\" doesn't cut it.  WHY is it good?  What can they improve upon?  This thread is so that users can improve the quality of their content, not just a place to fish for views.\n\nWhile it's not an official rule, it's encouraged that you give feedback first to users who haven't received any yet.  Keep in mind that the more feedback you give, the more likely you are to get more feedback yourself!\n\nAnd don't forget to check out our creator-focused website, [Fetch](http://www.veryfetch.net) for tutorials, and [Fetch Quest](http://quest.veryfetch.net) to join the NewTubers team.",

I\u2019m not really sure if I captured the genre of music but I really like how it came out so I wanted to still share it. \n\nPlease let me know what you think and any feedback on the video or music would be amazing and really appreciated.\n\nThank you for reading and watching the video!\n\nLink-\n\nExploring Melodic Bass #1 - My 2nd try ever! || Checkpoint\nhttps://youtu.be/d_tO_x1SJVg",

            "Really great editing and sound.  Youve clearly been doing this awhile so take what I have to say with a grain of salt. You may get more search volume with \"Star Fox 64 Ending Keeps My Fathers Legacy Alive\". Star Fox 64 Ending has right around 3k monthly searches and I just looked at the top video and they dont have that exact wording. You might be able to rank above them with that switch.",
            "My biggest question for this, why didn\u2019t you mention Overwatch anywhere in the title, description, or thumbnail? Same could be said for your \u201cLeague of Losers\u201d song. It helps a lot when you reference the game you are parodying. It\u2019s more likely to appear for people that\u2019s looking things up for that game. You\u2019re holding yourself back by not using key words that people will look for, like \u201cOverwatch\u201d or \u201cLeague of legends\u201d. At least put it in the tags. Besides that, I believe the music was good and the thumbnails are nice. \u00a0I can see this working, keep it up.",
            "Hey! I checked out your video and have two suggestions: 1. The duration is really long so maybe you can break it into smaller episodes. More content for you that way and keeps the audience glued. 2. You can improve on the framing where you sit and talk. Take it from a distance so that your hand gestures are visible. Good luck!",
            "I think the topic you had was interesting and we can tell you\u2019re very into it. Going by first glance, before watching the video, I would say that the title and thumbnail could be improved. Since you\u2019re aiming towards the general audience it\u2019s better to use something simple like \u201cHow does our AC keep us cool\u201d. People just browsing the web could look at it and just go \u201cHuh, how does that work\u201d and click on it. It\u2019s something anyone can end up searching for as well. Now for the actual video, I think your explanations are done well and I like the demonstrations you show. The video though is very quiet. So, it feels like we\u2019re watching a lecture for class. Put in some background music. It can be something to your liking but keep it something smooth or relaxing. I think it\u2019s also good to start your video with something that is easily relatable and catches attention. Like a fun fact, a weird event, or something that happened to you personally. I don\u2019t really watch videos like this too often but I\u2019m using Vsauce as a reference while trying to give tips for this since it\u2019s a science channel that would catch my eye a lot back then.",
            "Your song is really good! It sounds like something I can listen to while working. The video is well made and I could definitely see it playing in a coffee shop or something. What software did you use to make the video?",
            "Great music, I enjoyed it. I'd only change the name and add more to the description.",
            "I think you can be smaller or less room background. I don\u2019t like the ceiling fan, maybe you can position camera less of the fan? Cause of the dark colour bit distracting, your face has to be the highlight! Other than that, i like the excitement, review and maybe you can create some form of meme reaction with yourself!",
            "I second what bellmeow is saying, but also wanted to mention your energy is cool! Definitely like how you jump straight into the game, but consider giving a *tiny* bit of context on what\u2019s happening in the video and what you want to show? Like for example a quick montage where you say \u201cI found out this game by XYZ\u201d or something else. Something that hooks the viewer giving them enough context to keep watching but curiosity for what\u2019s next. Keep it up.",
            "I love how your comment about the game in real time,it keeps me interested in your video!!!\ud83d\udc4d",
            "I like the idea of Ai and cooking. It\u2019s very relevant to what\u2019s popular right now and you\u2019re incorporating cooking into it which is unique. I would work on editing because the video right now seems a bit disjointed",
            "I actually really liked this, the editing is great and you have a natural presence on camera. My only criticism would be the vocals - they were too quiet at times - maybe tone down the BG audio a touch. I like the idea of incorporating magic, it's definitely an art form lost on many of the modern generation. I'd definitely watch more of these. \n\nI think it maybe also worth cutting them down and making a short version, this definitely has a short type feel too it (if that makes any sense).",
            "I think your editing is good, and you have good technical. For this video in particular It feels kind of disjointed. Like the scene with you doing card tricks didn't feel like it belonged. Felt like the pacing was off throughout, like it could have been a bit more snappy",
            "Hi! I really liked your video. I appreciate getting to see food in that type of environment as it's so different than what I experience where I'm from so thank you for sharing. My feedback for editing is maybe cut some of the filler b-roll stuff out or make them shorter as I really want to see the food and people making the food. But that's just me and it's a very small critique. Well done!",
            "I like the idea, very interesting, I am a sucker for asian culture. The editing and the footage are nice. One thing that bugs me are vertical clips with black borders, but it isn\u2019t such a big deal. Although in my case, I always try to fill those black borders with blurred mirror images of the main video. Then, I wouldn\u2019t mind if you narrated things a bit more. It felt a bit strange to see you eating but no telling us how it felt. I know you wrote it but it doesn\u2019t feel the same, at least for me.",
            "Hi fellow travel vloger.\n\nI enjoyed your video.\n\nI recommend adding some x4x8 speed to some scenes. Especially some food prep scenes so it does not seem like its taking forever.\n\nI like the music at around the 4:46 mark 11:30 min mark. I find this type of music is good for this type of vlog.\n\nAround 2:18 maybe not so but this is more of a personal thing for me. i like the other audio, makes it feel relaxed and goes with the pace. Even the 3 min mark one is good, it has a bit of upbeat to it but its not too much.\n\nPlease forgive me for that last tedious review comment.\n\nI loved the video!",
            "I love love love food market videos so this was really good to watch but I wished you spoke more about your thoughts on the items you ate/drank. I always love it when the person reviews the food, makes me want to try it even more! I thought the editing was good but I\u2019m also a newbie to content creation so take that feedback for what it\u2019s worth.",
            "I think the content has potential, but the execution was boring. You didn't provide enough value to the viewer. I would focus on making more cuts to the music, and add a voice overlay talking about your experience, and that will change the experience drastically.\n\nI also want to add, respect your viewers time. Cut this down to like a 3rd of the length, so it's actually watchable. Make every minute entertaining",
            "I would probably put a darker drop shadow or thicker outline around the text at the bottom, and move it up a little. Maybe make it a tad larger. Overall, your video seemed to cover all the bases with good music choices and editing to boot. Keep it up!",
            "Good video. Good job with quality and shooting up to 4k. and really great improvement with the description. \n\nRoom for improvement: Need more energy in your voiceover.",
            "The quality is AWESOME, can I ask what camera you use? And maybe I'd say either remove the background music and let the raw noise in, or put the music and remove the background noise, because putting both is pretty overwhelming",
            "This was a cool video to watch, especially as I\u2019m from the Uk and we don\u2019t really ever have big food markets like this (where I\u2019m from at least!) so I really liked all the footage you got, I would try more \u201ccinematic\u201d type style getting close ups and action shots if you like that kind of style. I would also try talking or more live taste tests if you feel comfortable doing that, of course feels strange talking to a camera to begin with but it does get easier! Keep at it, I can definitely see other people enjoying this kind of content too! \ud83d\ude01",
            "Looks good from what I've seen thus far. If you could, try to put the location in that title frame since it's not in the title itself. I found myself as a viewer on YT looking around trying to if this was Vancouver or what.",

            "Anti gravity video: \n\nAudio is waaay to quiet and not very clear. The voice is low energy, doesn't make me want to stay  \nres of images also quite low\n\n\n\nHow to blow up planets:\n\nvoice waaay better, more engaging and louder, audio quality still quite low, periods of \"dead air\" which is terrible for shorts\n\nimage quality also low\n\n  \nKeep making videos you'll get it",
            "I loved the subject matter of the first video. Coincidentally, my next video will be about Dyson spheres, so you got a new sub out of me! Ok, to feedback.\n\nFirst video: Some quiet music that sets the mood would be good. You can use the music selector when uploading your short to easily get one without having to mess with music rights. I also think the video quality is quite low. I'm not sure if this is due to your source material being low resolution, but if not, make sure you render the video with at least 1080 x 1920 vertical resolution. \n\nSecond video: The audio is quieter and lower quality. Make sure to play with your audio settings such as gain, distance from the microphone, and even noise filtering, to get something that works. Audio quality is super important for YouTube, and it's something I'm still trying to improve myself. The video quality is probably still a little low in this one. A small tip for the first image in this video - if you can make the image slowly zoom in/out or slide left/right while you're talking, that makes it a little more engaging as it's not a completely static image. This applies to your first video as well. An example of this in a short is below.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Y8bnqxAbMNg](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Y8bnqxAbMNg)",
            "Nice drawings. As someone who does animated shorts of animals, one piece of advice I have is to try different characters in different series-so you can give yourself a wider net of potential viewers. (On my channel, I usually do a different animal each short, so that a new audience can find my channel)",
            "First off I wanna say your channel design is so cute! I like the cozy vibes y\u2019all are tryna create and the pfp and banner is adorable. The commentary through the LP was pretty funny but chill enough to not take away from the story. I could still follow what was going on in this second part without having seen the first so I feel like that\u2019s a bonus. My suggestion would be adding yourselves into the video if y\u2019all are comfortable being on camera. I personally feel like seeing the person playing the game helps me stay a bit more engaged in the video and create a bit more of that parasocial bond lol \ud83d\ude02. Still nice quality regardless, keep it up !",
            "I love you channel! I subscribed. I went to check the one about not having children and you've made so much improvements on how you talk to the camera and the sound quality.

            "Good start! I love channels like this. Maybe consider adding sound effects for more immersion? I've also seen folks shorten the length of each caption, just so that words change more often and it's more attention-grabbing (possibly more retention).",

            "You did a great job on this one! I really liked the examples you were giving of the different exercises, very nice touch! I'd recommend turning the volume of the background music somewhat so that it isn't overpowering your speech. There were some mic plosives when you were speaking, you might want to look into some ways to fix this -- I've been struggling with this one myself off of my gaming headset! I sometimes bring the headset mic too close to my mouth while speaking, which causes it.",
            "Nice work! These are the kinds of videos that seem to either get zero attention or absolutely blow up. A couple of things I can think of.\n\nThis video format might work better in shorts, where people are expecting more voiceless/faceless videos. Perhaps this could have been two short videos instead of one long video. \n\nFor me personally, the text moved a little too fast. To keep the engagement of the fast pace text with the music, maybe you could have each word stay on the screen for longer and have new words pop up with the music like you did at 0:48 with the symptoms. \n\nI personally would also say that the video was too short to have a 15 second call to action in the middle of it. But, it's kind of on brand, so maybe it works. I just lean to having it at the end instead.",

I will say maybe to have a bit more of a clear topic in mind, I'm not sure people will want to check out a video if the topic is so broad. But I enjoyed it!\n\nAlso, the end cards that youtube does showed up well before the video was over, so the last 20 seconds or so are being covered up by your channel name and other videos. You might want to add an end card so that stuff doesn't interfere with the content.",

The one critique I have was that I almost put the video down at the bit in the middle that seemed like an outro that wasn\u2019t. Would be curious if you get any view drop offs at that part, but maybe it\u2019s just me!",

Though I felt distracted when well-known actors like Matt Damon or Tom Cruise pop up. It kind of pulls me out of things. \n\nThe said, I wouldn't say I'm particularly interested in spies or the Cold War, but your script was engaging enough to keep me interested through the whole thing!",

For non-enthusiasts, it might be good to clarify a bit more about *why* an M1/2/3 Mac is still plenty enough. Maybe talking about how the jump from M2 to M3 wasn't that important for 95% of people? \n\nAlso \"Intel Macs are inexplicably cheap\" isn't a fair statement IMO. Apple Silicon, even M1, is *far* superior to Intel for even the most casual of users. Though that's up to the opinion of the writer, not my place to judge here haha.",

I like Kpop content a good bit and your shorts are pretty cute and funny (like the Bangchan one lol), but in general I wouldn\u2019t usually subscribe to a channel that primarily post shorts. I know you said you had some longer form content, but I didn\u2019t see it due to your shorts being under your main video page. Maybe you could separate the two? Even if the longer videos don\u2019t do as well initially, I say keep trying them out if you like to make them! Maybe some commentary or ranking videos on Kpop content?

My suggestion would be to skip the whole intro. \"Well this is something so embarrassing\" is a great place to start a video, and for one as short as yours, I feel like the intro is unnecessary. I would also consider posting it via YT Shorts as well! I think it fits the format well.",

If you could get in in the length of a short and made a couple of those I think you would get a lot of views, and your audience would transfer over to yhour 'long' form videos says they aren't htat much longer",

            "Very snappy, quick editing to keep people's attention, which is smart and makes your video flow very nicely. Also, the use of green screens was a nice touch and I don't feel like any of them were out of place. Overall, clean, well-made, and fun video!",
            "you're 100% right on the title. maybe save \"speed run\" for stuff you can grind out in under 50 seconds? having never even heard of this movie prior, i feel like i have a pretty decent understanding for it being a one minute review, so it was well done in that respect.",

It could be something small and simple to share about it, but more of that and less of the camera/tech info you\u2019re sharing. I\u2019m curious to know what your video would be like to experience if there\u2019s no music. Poetry is different for everyone. The music may lead a poet to think or feel a certain way.\n\nWouldn\u2019t worry about subscribers. Everyone\u2019s journey is different.",

You of course want to go quickly and not take for ever, cutting out as much empty time as possible. However I think you have over done it a bit and it is sometimes hard to follow, if you watch similar videos by other creators you can learn how they sometimes pause to add emphasis.",

I think it\u2019s a matter of when, not if your channel will gain significant growth.\n\nI like your use of thumbnails, I think if you stick with a similar format you\u2019ll develop a brand.\n\nNothing negative to say, but I\u2019m very much a layman. Keep at it and I\u2019ve no doubt you\u2019ll grow.",
            "This feels very professionally made in editing and voice acting. This is usually not the type of content I watch, so I can't compare it to much else. But I like anything urban, so this definitely was intriguing to me. I would prefer chapters though. Even if not integrated into the video itself, at least within the video I wouldn't mind a chapter preview to see what's coming, where the intro ends, etc. Especially since you repeat some sentences (i.e. about the celebrities), which would feel more natural if this was separated with chapters.",
            "Dude so good! Not much bad to say at all. If I had to pick one thing I think you could move quicker from your title cards into the content. I make similar content if you\u2019re down to check me out",

It is fairly hard to see the pattern on tracing paper, but that's just how tracing paper is. It might be possible to turn up the contrast in post production though so it shows up a little better on screen though.",

I like the editing too, one tiny thing with your background music and when you are talking I would do \u201cducking\u201d of the music, so it\u2019s slightly quieter when you are talking and then normal volume again when you aren\u2019t, just gives a little more contrast and movement for me! Otherwise great job! I know how long sewing projects take and then filming them too! \ud83d\ude01",

            "Your skill at this really shines through! Well lit, well shot, and well edited. I think you should show off the finished product right at the start of the video to hook people in and try to make the title and thumbnail a bit more exciting. Great video!",
            "Good stuff! I think you can lower the music volume a bit. It would be great to hear more of the making of the clothes. Similar to an ASMR, we wanna hear the pencils, the cutting etc. \n\nTitles, thumbnails are very important for YouTube. Package it well. I noticed in your video you said you only had a limited amount of fabric. You could try using that as the topic of your video, make the thumbnail, title and intro around that idea. \n\nGoodluck!",
            "This is so cute! I think you did a really good job with having different frames and angles for when you were doing the project. One improvement that I can think of is maybe putting some text on the screen for certain parts of the video to emphasis a task. I find that occasion text when doing \u201chow to\u201d videos wakes the viewer up and grabs their attention once again. :)",

            "i like this idea. have you ever seen the channel \"how to drink\"? he has a few episodes on drinks based on games. i think your intro is pretty nice. i like your \"stage\", so to speak, but the snake plants being in the foreground distracts from you. id move them behind you. having more than one camera angle is nice. \n\nalso, when you do the text early on, it seems to drag on a bit with just the black screen. \n\nif you would have started your channel a year ago, i probably would have been a big fan, but kicking 14 years of extreme alcoholism - yea im gonna pass for now. either way, best of luck. perhaps ill stumble up your channel again in the future. left a like.",
            "Hello! Just wanna say wow this is a great concept in execution! I really loved the lore lesson while you were putting together the drink. Your voice is pleasant to listen to and your set is nice and well lit. \n\nIf I had to come up with a reason for low CTR, I would say the title could use some work.  Something like \"I made Elden Cocktails with fire\" or something like that (I struggle with titles and thumbnails too lol). Currently the title is a bit plain and doesn't invoke a NEED to see what you are doing.    \n  \nThe thumbnail is a great start! but its a little busy. My eye doesn't know where to go. You could try some composition, darkening the edges and drawing the users eyes to the fire. Maybe some text to point something out I'm not sure. There are lots of videos on Youtube on how to make a thumbnail. (This is one I really like if you have the time to check it out [how to make a killer thumbnail (for the 2024 algorithm) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TolBiTrUg4))\n\nLastly, I think your view duration could be improved if you really focus on the first 30 seconds, I want to see you either making the drinks or video game footage, not so much you talking (no offense lol). So I would say cut the intro down to like 10 seconds, show 2/3  drinks in those 10 seconds to build intrigue, and get right into it. The slow motion on the pour is nice. I think the B-roll footage is the aesthetically pleasing part of this. So if you don't have enough of you pouring liquids, maybe footage of you getting the items could add some, with more gameplay stuff.  \n\nSorry if that was a lot, feel free to pick and choose any of this advice lol.",
            "Heya. I'm a graphic design major as well. I really like the idea behind this channel and the message behind the video was super well put. However, I think it'd be a really smart idea to try some more small animations in the video to keep it a little more eye catching. Just simple stuff doesn't have to be anything crazy. But I think it'll help you maintain viewer retention and focus on your art as well as the message behind it.\n\n[Things like the one shot with the rainy car ride were perfect!]",
            "I think this is great. Your voice isn't alarming and has a nice tone to it. I like that it's not an \"in your face\" type of video.

            "You\u2019re a really good animator. The intro was really good to you immediately got my attention and before I knew it I was already like a minute and 30 seconds into the video. You definitely were able to hook me right in in terms of any improvement all I could say is maybe add some statistics like human spend eczema number time on screams or in reality only .0001% are actually making millions at that age on YouTube etc. stuff like that maybe that will help people get the scope of things and not be so hard on themselves, I would probably introduce his engaged!",
            "I really love the visuals and animations.\n\nLove that you jump right into the story from the beginning. I was hooked from the get go.\n\nI'd recommend adding music underneath it to keep me entrained. It feels a bit empty in that regard and would add a lot to it.\n\nYou stumble over your words around 3:35-40. Edit that out when going through the audio. It would be one thing if you were doing a podcast, but since yours is a more polished product definitely want to avoid those kinds of things.\n\n  \nPractice your vocal dynamics and range. You have a great speaking voice and are pleasant to listen to. That said, it's fairly monotone. If you're looking for a practice, take some shakespeare or a scene from movie or book you like and go through it with a bunch of wild and silly voices playing in a variety of ranges. See how they change the story you are telling. You can do this with your scripts as well, and over time it will become second nature.\n\n  \nTItle: I think HOW vs WHY makes more sense here. You're teaching, vs sharing why.\n\n  \nWhy should I listen to you?\n\nThis isn't a criticism, just a question from the audiences perspective. Are you a therapist? A person who has gone through therapy? A mental health advocate? etc.\n\nI would consider sharing a bit more about who you are that lends some context and credibility for why you are qualified to give the advice you are giving\n\nEven consider giving less direct advice and sharing more about your own personal experience/why it worked for you vs telling the audience what to do CAN be more effective as a teaching tool. If you're more specific with your journey too, it will better define your specific audience and the specific type of people who will benefit from your work.\n\nGreat work! I hope something in this was useful for you :)",
            "Hello, I watched your video. I liked that you used physical comic book in the video, it is an interesting concept. I think the sound quality could be better.

I do have a few notes -\n\n- you have a nice confident voice which made it really easy to hear and connect to - especially for a comic review video. This is because it actually kinda sounded like an announcer about to recap a previous episode to me so I already felt cartoon/ comic book vibes from it!\n\n- you mention briefly that some authors have been treating Peter Parker badly, and that this story is great because he\u2019s shown in a good light/ already got his family and all the stuff he wanted. I\u2019ve watched some videos from other comic reviewer channels that when they mention something from other comics, they have links to other videos or wiki links that explain that comic so the viewers can see what they\u2019re talking about. You might want to try that =]\n\nAll in all though, good video!",

I\u2019ve remarked the latter because I think people wouldn\u2019t watch a video longer than 10 min on the topic, but you made it short and to the point. Only thing I\u2019d improve is the audio volume. Sometimes the music is too loud:)",
            "Hi \n\nI like the idea of the video. The only problem is that sometimes I did not understand what you were saying because you were talking a bit too fast. If you work on that this will definitely improve the overall quality. Keep up the work! :)",

Watching your video I noticed your tonality and manner of speaking doesn't really change that much. You need to be using more of your dynamic vocal range. You don't have to be a HEY WHATS UP EVERYBODY WELCOME TO THE TOP 5 THINNNNGGSSS YAAYY!!!! But just a little bit of excitement and adding some inflection to your commentary to make the moments stick in our brains and make your video memorable would work wonders!",
            "Hey man! I watched your video and I have some points to talk about if that\u2019s ok:\n\n- your first point slide, it\u2019s hard to read because it moves very fast to the next scene. Maybe consider slowing and pausing at that slide for a bit longer, and doing like a \u201cstatic\u201d sound since you had the static screen in the background\n- the voice is pretty monotone and I couldn\u2019t detect any changes in your voice so it came off as reading from a script and being a bit less enthusiastic to give your opinion. I\u2019m not saying to be like super enthusiastic but it made it hard to keep listening\n- overall it did feel a bit rushed, like even the end \u201c don\u2019t forget to like and subscribe\u201d seemed to have been sped up, or maybe I\u2019m just tripping on that.\n\nThat\u2019s my points though, it did make me want to watch more of the boys and I\u2019m hoping to see more of your videos!",
            "Opening first few seconds, try to have more engaging visuals, or at least do panning shots of still images\n\nTry to make your voice sound more \"flowing\" more naturally speaking as it's kinda hard to focus \n\n  \nMaybe record yourself chatting to your friends and then listen to this to hear the natural speaking difference",
            "If you can I would film more of the process of building the home and make that the majority of the video. Viewers wanna be taken through a journey, the ending of the video should be what you have right now.",
            "I really liked your video. Haven\u2019t seen something like this before but it got my attention. The story telling is nice, the b-rolls are good and the colour grading is perfect. Just one suggestion - maybe try to get more variety in your shots. Most of these are left to right pans. Thank you.",
            "Nicely done!  Your audio is on point--whatever you're doing, keep doing it.  Your static shots, and drone footage are well done.  However, consider using pans/tilts much more sparingly.  When showcasing the interior of a space, do a \"push in and pan\" movement.  Keep your feet planted, slowly push your camera in, and gently pan it only a couple of degrees.  (This usually works best if you use a gimbal of some sort).  The camera only needs to move a foot or two, and the panning should be very subtle.  Remember, less is more.  If you're trying to show your audience the entire space, consider backing into a corner, then doing the push in and pan movement, looking into the room.  Do this movement from all corners, so you have lots to choose from in post.  Nice channel!  You're totally killing it (in my newbie opinion)!",
            "Bro ngl you edit very good am guessing After effects, but i can see a big problem from the start of the video, it looks zoomed in the quality is low and the texts don't feet in the screen.\nThats all, hope u succeed",
            "You seem pretty natural on camera what I would say is square up more to the camera look directly in it instead of kind of sitting to the side. I also say maybe put the end product right in the beginning of the video so people get the satisfaction, knowing yes this is what the end product is and then you go into talking about it or how you built it, great job getting almost 500 followers. By the way great job!!!",
            "Nice vids!\n\nI\u2019d say it sounds like you\u2019re not 100% confident talking in front of the camera, but as you adjust to it I\u2019ll imagine that will come naturally. Another thing seems to be over-use of video transitions. I\u2019d focus on trying to get a clean cut and try tone them down a bit. \n\nLast thing is your thumbnails, whilst your Vienna one is good, the others are lacking a bit. Schengen is in the right direction but it still feels a bit flat, and doesn\u2019t stand out. Hallstatt one isn\u2019t great, the font doesn\u2019t really do you any justice either. I\u2019d try to focus on sans serif fonts, thick and bold, and try not to overdo the text. Just Hallstatt is fine, the rest seems unnecessary. Especially if I\u2019m looking at the thumbnail on a phone, some of it is just illegible.\n\nAll in all pretty good though mate just stick at it \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb",

            "Idk much about gaming content, but if we look at it as a whole your videos are too long for a starting channel, i suggest you focus more on shorts and convert the viewers to the long form. For example you can make a short as a commentator about a popular streamer playing elden ring, then slowly change the topic to the game, it's basically using well known influencers as a clickbait.\nHope u succeed",
            "I like this. I think adding some light music in the background would be good. The lighting could be worked on. Something where it doesn't reflect too much off the glass. As a crafter, I try to cut my videos down by speeding up certain parts as well as cutting out repetitive parts. This is what I'm currently learning. Using the YT Create app has easy editing and nice background sounds that are free to use.\n\nI think the information is great! I hope to see more!\n\nEdit - I just noticed the music. Sorry! I had to turn up the sound more on my phone..",
            "I think maybe add some music in the very beginning, and the voice over audio quality was really good but then when you're talking while holding the camera it got a lot louder and was noticeably worse. maybe try to balance that out a bit.\n\n  \nLooking forward to seeing where it goes!",
            "As a channel that does building, we know how tricky it can be to keep attention while showing the process. Overall, I like how you incorporated inspirational messages during the \"slower\" building sequences. At first it felt out of place or random, so potentially I'd suggest some cue going into the inspirational messages. Maybe like a sound effect or music. Overall, good video and making the hobby look accessible.",
            "Hello! I\u2019ve watched your content before and I\u2019ve got to say that I do enjoy the topics that you cover. :) I like how you have chapters on this video which make distinguishing ideas clearer and makes the video easier to follow. The one thing I can think of to improve is maybe wrap up the video at the end, almost like a quick \u201csummary\u201d or the main points touched upon in the video. Hope this helps :)",
            "I liked this video a lot, and it\u2019s funny because I actually noticed that starting my YouTube channel has absolutely cluttered my brain as I am constantly juggling work, fitness, YouTube, spending time with my wife, tending to the dog, and then trying to make room in there for relaxation / social life. The analogies to running a computer were fantastic, (and maybe I missed something) \nMy one critique is that I felt like the ending point about \u201cunplugging\u201d seemed to go outside the theme of the whole video. Maybe if you had tied it to \u201cif you leave your computer on all the time it\u2019s bad for it\u201d or just drove it home with these same awesome analogies you were using, it would not have felt that way.\nBut keep it up man.",

The picture you show makes it look focuses more on the desert than luxury. The more you sell us on how awesome Dubai appears, the more impact what\u2019s underneath will be.\n* The History\n   * 2500 BCE\n      * Match the images. You\u2019re showing a modern pipeline instead of palm agriculture. It\u2019s ok if they\u2019re drawn or what it looks like today but the current image is incongruent with your dialouge\n   * You sound somewhat uncomfortable with the pronunciations. Practice a bit more so that you have more confidence with them.\n* Labor COnditions\n   * You\u2019re using that filter with the glittery shadow effect constantly. It\u2019s cool if that\u2019s youtube main aesthetic, but I\u2019d still choose when and why you want that effect vs just using it across the entire film. Otherwise it becomes distracting..\n      * Remember everything you are doing is storytelling.\n   * Not a fan of the migrant document moving around like I\u2019m on a ship at sea.\n      * Again, it\u2019s not a bad effect, I\u2019d just recommend using it more inteitionally vs as frequent it is in this section. It\u2019s makin me feel a bit sea sick.\n   * You have a great voiceover voice.\n      * That said, keep working on repetitive cadences. Play around with different vocal tones and ranges. Otherwise everything becomes kind of rote sounding. I shouldn\u2019t be able to predict when your up and down flexions are going to happen, but I can.\n   * \u201cMy employer has my passport\u201d\n      * Again, moving text. No bueno.

Make your commentary more specific vs general.\n* PortaPotty\n   * You could do a whole episode on this topic.\n* Low Wage workers\n   * Again match the image. You\u2019re showing what looks like white collar people in an office.\n* So what?\n   * That\u2019s not meant to be mean lol. But I think having a call to action for what we can do about it or why it should matter to me is important. If someone is considering living there I could see that being a thing. But I think asking yourself why you want people to know this information, and what you hope they do with it and then enrolling the audience into that will be valuable.\n      * As to my earlier point, I think contrasting some more of the video with the positive aspects of Dubai, creates a more interesting conversation for people in the comments to chat about.\n      * Are the tradeoffs worth it? Is it ok to tour here or host a conference here? Move here for a great job? What benefits is Dubai\u2019s society providing the world (economically or otherwise).\n* Again GREAT video. And feel free to take anything here that doesn\u2019t resonate with you and throw it in the trash. But hoping it provides some value to get even better as a creator.\n   * Best of luck.",
