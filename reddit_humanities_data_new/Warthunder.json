            ">The parameters of the high-explosive impact of shaped-charge shells, ATGMs with shaped-charge warheads and HESH shells have been reworked to ensure the mechanics of penetrating through thin armor at the point of impact by the high-explosive part of the explosion.\n\nFinally",

The specified crew order only applies to the selected vehicle preset; accordingly, each vehicle preset can have its own crew order. In the near future, we\u2019ll also add the ability to rearrange crews by dragging and dropping, rather than just selecting a crew from a drop-down menu.",

            ">For aircraft with ARH missiles, a limitation on the number of simultaneously operating missile data link channels has been implemented. When launching more missiles than the carrier\u2019s radar can provide, missile data link will work for missiles launched last. The limit on the number of data link channels is indicated in the radar tooltip in X-ray mode. Current radar restrictions:\n\n    Su-27SM, MiG-29SMT, Tornado, JAS39 \u2014 2 missile data link channels.\n    F-16C, Barak II, F-4F KWS LV \u2014 6 missile data link channels.\n    F-15C \u2014 8 missile data link channels.\n    J-11A \u2014 one missile data link channel.\n    F-14 \u2014 6 missile data link channels.\n\nAre those values realistic? Also, what about m2k-5f? edit: just checked ingame, m2k-5f has value 2.",
            "* **Mirage 2000D-R1, Mirage 2000-5F, Mirage 2000C-S5**\u00a0\u2014 MAWS has been added.\n\nOUI FRANCE NUMERO 1 RHAAAAAAAAA",

It lacks pulse modes (LPRF), but has a Raid Assessment tracking mode - RAM, switching to which and back is made from the usual tracking mode by pressing the \u201cChange Radar/IRST mode\u201d control. Note that illumination of targets for SARH missiles is impossible in the Raid Assessment mode.\n\nCan't find this in game, am I misinterpreting what this means or did they not add it?",

It's been [2 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/wxjk0a/comment/ilrf2j1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) since EFS was added to some planes, and [4 years since a Report](https://web.archive.org/web/20220825205453/https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/484101-fire-extinguishes/) to the devs included relevant info to cover EFS for several JPN aircraft.\n\nI wonder how that will change enagements and behaviour... I ground my way up the JPN props learning that 'if you get looked at = you get set on fire', and what you can do to put out the fire. If I can engage EFS on these, it should let me fight again rather than turning off the engine and diving in hopes the fire goes out before I disintegrate.",
            "So the War Thunder 3D model of HMS Queen Mary arguably helps make understanding her demise at Jutland  as with the positions of the magazines able to be looked at, it becomes very quickly apparent that once Queen Mary was hit in the forward part around the 4\" castmates, she was doomed",
            ">For Air Realistic Battles, a game mode setting that allows you to participate in battles with smaller team sizes (maximum 12 players per team) has been added. To enable the option, go to the game mode selection window (under the \u201cTo Battle!\u201d button), then on the Air Realistic Battles button. Here click \u201cGame Mode Settings\u201d and toggle the \u201cParticipate in battles with smaller team sizes\u201d option. This option is only available for aircraft with a Battle Rating of 10.0 or higher.\n\nThis is a highly important change. I advise everyone check this box, and tell people in game to check it as well. Air RB needs smaller matches, and this is the way to make it so.",
            "Type 93 and Type 81C being in the first wave for more detailed damage models, ouch... not that it will matter much when you get 50cal'ed through the window.\n\nTooltip for the Type 81 seems to mention the FCS controlling LWS and LR... got my hopes up that the Type 81 now has laser warnings :( I'm guessing they just use LWS/LR as a catch-all rather than having it tailored per vehicle.\n\nInterestingly, the PUMA doesn't list LWS/LR as being controlled by the FCS (or any other module, that I can tell). I don't know much about the PUMA, so I wonder if that's intentional or an oversight.\n\nEDIT: The Pantsir FCS is... [interesting](https://imgur.com/a/VX7OiMe) :D",

I especially like the changes to the  hitcam/target ship status view and the new Show crew distribution feature.\n\nLooking forward to play on the new and revamped maps. I'm so used to having some fear of the map changes, cause it feels like a coin flip - either maps get better, or much, much worse. \ud83d\udc40",

I get that it's annoying if your loader gets hurt and you're stuck with slow reloading for the rest of the battle, but  I'm hoping the crew are not like regenerators from RE4 where the wounded debuffs are almost nonexistent now because they heal too rapidly.\n\nI'm fine with it in arcade battles though, and I play arcade battles mainly, just I think for realistic battles it should be slowed so wounded crew are still penalizing throughout the match, and it takes minutes to recover instead of seconds. Maybe you could go to a capture point and activate crew replenishment to \"swap the wounded crew out with fresh ones\" etc. as a way to heal them in a roundabout way. Or maybe they only heal half of the debuffs applied so they recover some of their ability but not all, and a badly hurt loader will still have a moderate penalty once he's gotten his bearings and figured out how to load the gun with one arm missing and the breech slippery from blood.",

As it's not a series to care about realism, the focus is just on fun, and having missiles be nigh guaranteed kills would be really boring gameplay which no sane developer would ever-\n\nOh wait. Hi Gaijin.\n\nAs a bit of an extra note, I grew up playing games like Ace Combat so when I first reached higher BR jets in this game it was extremely jarring that I couldn't just turn to avoid missiles. It's a very strange concept coming from arcade flight games. I can't say I've ever found it fun. Getting hit by an AIM-9L in a G.91YS rarely feels deserved.

In jet combat on top of that you have to know what missile and how many it carries (radar/IR, long/medium/dogfight range, IRCCM or without it), how good their RWR is, how good their radar is and then you get to positioning (can my missile reach at this distace if he maunevers, can the guy behind me launch missile reliably, can i succesfully notch ornoutpull their radar missiles).

The Ministry of National Defence organized a seminar, led by Dr. Eui-Hwan Kim, inviting experts from various countries to provide advice before the concept design phase.\n\nThe attendees included:\n\nIsrael: General Israel Tal (Merkava 1/2/3)\nJapan: MHI engineer Hayashi Iwao (Type 74/Type 90)\nUSA: General Dynamics engineer Philip W. Lett (M48/M60/M1)\nSweden: Bofors engineer Sven Berge (Strv 74/Strv 103/UDES Project)\nUnited Kingdom: Professor Richard M. Ogorkiewicz, Imperial College London\nStarting in July 1995, the Agency for Defense Development (ADD) conducted systematic conceptual research on the next-generation tank until December 1997. This involved determining the tank\u2019s capabilities, performance, appearance, necessary technologies, development methods, and expected efficiency.\n\nOverseas studies were conducted with the Ministry of National Defense\u2019s permission, sending 7 individuals to the UK for a year of training.\n\nBetween November 1998 and December 2002, ADD developed numerous technologies and software for the next-generation tank, including the K2\u2019s cannon, target tracker, APS, and autoloader.\n\nFull-scale development commenced in 2003, and after four years, the first prototype emerged in 2007. In September 2008, it was declared combat-ready. Due to delays in developing a domestic powerpack, the German powerpack from the prototype (MTU MT883 Ka-501 engine and Renk HSWL 295 transmission) was used for the initial production in 2011.\n\nIn second productions, the K2 was equipped with a powerpack featuring a DV27K engine from Doosan Infracor (now HD Hyundai Infracor) and a Renk HSWL 295 transmission, which continued in the third production, including the K2GF exported to Poland.\n\nFirepower\nK2 tank is equipped with the CN08 120mm L/55 tank cannon as its primary weapon and the M60E2 as its coaxial machine gun. Additionally, it has a 12.7mm K6 machine gun mounted in the commander\u2019s hatch for multipurpose use.\n\n Spoiler\nProtection\nThe basic structure of the K2 tank is made of MIL-12560H steel plates, and the composite armor is made of SiC, replacing the AlO3 used in the first-generation KSAP, to achieve higher protection. In addition, it is equipped with ERA, LWR, and MWR to achieve high survivability.\n\n Spoiler\nMobility\nK2 tank has a 51t basic weight, 55t combat weight, 70km/h forward and 34km/h reverse top speed and can climb up to 31\u00b0 slope.\n\n Spoiler\nInterior\n3 crew members are on board, and ammunition storage is located at the rear of the turret and the front left of the hull.\n\n Spoiler\nSources\n Spoiler",

            "I can definitely see an argument for the K1 at the very least since it's an Abrams derivative.",
            "The political thing is just one side of it though. Another big factor is that Japan and South Korea simply have nothing to do with each other militarily. They don't use each other's vehicles and neither assisted the other in their respective vehicle's development. Maybe they're both part of the USA's strategy to counter China, but we're not arguing for Japan and South Korea to both go in the American tree or anything. \n\nIf people don't like the idea of playing a standalone Korean tree, they can simply choose not to grind it. In any case, while it ultimately relies on Gaijin implementing it properly (lol), the suggestions I've seen for a unified Korean tree actually look pretty promising.",
            "> Taiwanese tanks go in the Chinese tree for instance\n\nTaiwan's official name is the Republic of China. Both them and the PRC's official position is that each is the only legitimate government of all of China. It's not remotely the same as South Korea and Japan at all and I have no idea why people keep trying to use this argument. It makes no sense.\n\nBut sure, they're neighbouring. Israel's tree is looking quite sparse, and Arab countries are close by. Maybe Israel can receive some vehicles from there.\n\n> Gaijin aren\u2019t doing any new trees\n\nSays who?",

            "What's people's opinion on the Polish tech tree? I'm no historian myself but I think polish tech tree would offer a good mix of vehicles from different nations whilst offering some unique ones from early world war 2 and unique modifications like Twardy. But still it would probably be a bit of a copy paste one and the issue  is that of it were to be added as a subtree it would be hard to place them. Russia's tree is already too big, UK has South Africa.",
            "could help in some minor's opinion, and that's the end",
            "Yes i am aware of the existence of the costal navy trees. However, I would like the devs to introduce balanced and fun content instead of optional exercises in self flagellation.",
            "It\u2019s just pointless slop content, you don\u2019t need a whole tree of copy paste just for the like 10 tanks you want in game from a certain nation.",
            "My goal is to make strong unique tech trees while getting away from the trends of homogenization where the same vehicles can be found in every tech tree.  It\u2019s probably not a hill worth dying on, but I still want to avoid situations like the Hungarian sub tree that adds a few unique WW2 vehicles (if that), and then serves as an excuse to add a bunch of copy paste vehicles from other nations to pad out lineups\u2026..and in the process has turned Italy into another tree with Gripens, MiG-29s, T-72s ans Leopard 2s etc. \n\nJapan needs some help and Thailand is better than nothing, but I\u2019m still drawn to the appeal of a top tier line up consisting of Type 10s and K2s that can\u2019t be found in any other tree\u2026..but who am I kidding, even if Japan got a South Korean tech tree, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the Germans get a premium Polish K2, and the Swedish get a Norwegian k2 squadron vehicle.",
            "gaijin has denied korean subtree in japan for several times and they are gonna get thailand subtree, which passed to the developers as soon as they appeared at the forum. but weeb's cringe is never gonna stop lolol",
            "But again, North and South Korea have even less to do with each other military apart from the fact they\u2019re hyper antagonistic towards each other.  South Korea and Japan are more likely to fight side by side than South Korean and the DPRK. \n\nStill I would rather get a unified Korean tech tree than get no Korean vehicles at all.",
            "Then it should go to Poland since it literally has K2s",
            "Key word being \"tested\", they never bought it. \n\nSweden already has too many test vehicles, but at least they were evaluated by Sweden, I don't think the game should go down the \"Subtree is close to another subtree and that's close to another subtree and they kinda sat in the tank for 5 seconds so the main tech tree should get it\" route",
            "perform a independenced one with NK like china, starting from rank IV.\n\nproblem solved.",
            "Poland should be a subtree, not quite enough for a full one",
            "I understand that, but I also think South Korean vehicles would offer a lot to the game and adding them as a unified standalone tree is the best way to do so.",
            "> My goal is to make strong unique tech trees while getting away from the trends of homogenization where the same vehicles can be found in every tech tree.\n\nUnfortunately, that's just the way things are with modern vehicles. Countries simply make a lot less of their own stuff than they used to.\n\nYes, Gaijin has been lazy, but even if that wasn't the case, there's a limited base they can draw from in the first place.",
            "There's the Thai Gripen and I think a Thai Harrier for Japan was leaked as well. But they insist that Japan is going to get that South Korean subtree any day now, just you wait...",
            "They're still both Korea, like how the PRC and ROC are both China. But at the end of the day, they could probably make it work by just adding South Korea and then giving them Turkish vehicles too.",
            "it is so simple, like china and taiwan, SK and SK will be in the same 'korea' techtree. not about being antagonistic or about the militarical relativity.",

            "Yeah just grind through all the copy paste M48s and T-62s first, I'm so looking forward to that so much fun.",
            "That\u2019s true, but it\u2019s also why I\u2019m advocating for greater selection with sub trees.  I.E. combing South Korea and Japan creates a stronger, more unique tech tree than combining Japan and Thailand, which mostly serves to further homogenize the tree. Conversely a standalone Korean tech tree just adds another minor nation tree, which is over time going to add a lot more copy paste vehicles to the game and will potentially face the same problems that trees like Italy, Japan and Israel are facing. \n\nLike I said, it\u2019s probably not a hill worth dying as on as it\u2019s already a lost battle, but I consider this one opportunity to not make things worse.",
            ">But they insist that Japan is going to get that South Korean subtree any day now, just you wait...\n\nWho is this \"they\" exactly? I haven't seen such statements for years now",
            "That could work too, creating a \u201cmisc\u201d nation for minor vehicles. \n\nI\u2019m still not a fan of combining Taiwan and the PRC, and I kind of wish the game moved more towards creating \u201cpolitical blocks\u201d given the nature of modern politics. \n\nI\u2019ve been very vocal about adding Korea to Japan as I think it makes the most sense from a purely gameplay perspective\u2026..but I just want Korean vehicles in the game, and I\u2019ll be happy wherever they go as long as it\u2019s well implemented.",
