            "blows my mind how rejecting the Vatican still keeps you Roman Catholic ... that no action is being done to remove one self from excummunication... that staying in perpetual tangent from The Church is still being in the Church?\n\n[https://arcwp.org/about-us/](https://arcwp.org/about-us/)\n\n>*The ordained women of the Association of Roman Catholic Women Priests (ARCWP) live and minister in the United States, Canada, Latin America and around the world. We prepare and ordain qualified women and men to serve the people of God as priests. We use equal rites to promote equal rights and justice for women in the church. We affirm that justice for all of God\u2019s people is constitutive to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.*\n\n[https://www.romancatholicwomenpriests.org/history/](https://www.romancatholicwomenpriests.org/history/)\n\n>*The question of women\u2019s ordination in the Church in the early 20th century was linked to the question of women\u2019s suffrage in several countries. The St. Joan\u2019s Alliance campaigned in both England and the USA in 1911 for both women\u2019s ordination and women\u2019s suffrage.\u00a0 As the 20th century progressed, numerous Protestant denominations began to ordain women. By mid-century, most of the mainline denominations in the USA had some ordained women.\u00a0 A big breakthrough occurred when the Episcopal Church USA, a member of the Anglican communion of churches, ordained women as priests officially in 1976. This breakthrough followed a long struggle, with 11 women being ordained illicitly (but validly) in 1974, followed by another group of 5 in 1975. This phenomenon inspired hundreds of Roman Catholic women who felt called to ordination to gather together with men and women theologians in Detroit, Michigan to organize an effort to bring their campaign to the Vatican. The gathering took place in late 1975, and was known as The Women\u2019s Ordination Conference. Shortly thereafter, in 1976, an organization was formed to carry this campaign forward, and it was named The Women\u2019s Ordination Conference.*\n\n>*There were almost immediate reactions in Rome to these developments. The Pontifical Biblical Commission studied the issue in 1976, and announced that there was no biblical impediment to the priestly ordination of women.*\n\n>*However, Pope Paul VI hastily issued an encyclical known as\u00a0Inter Insignores\u00a0which denied that women could adequately represent the male Jesus as presider at the Eucharistic table. Women\u2019s Ordination Conference was not deterred, but built a large constituency within the USA, and inspired women in many other countries to organize in similar ways in their countries.*\n\n>*Soon after, there was the Canadian Network for Women\u2019s Ordination and by 1985,\u00a0Maria von Magdala developed a group in Germany.\u00a0 By the mid-1990\u2019s there were also organized groups in Britain, Australia, New Zealand and many other countries.*\n\n>*In 1996, at the First European Women\u2019s Synod, held in Gmunden, Austria, representatives from the above-mentioned organizations and other interested women met to organize an international coalition which was to serve as an umbrella group for all of the individual groups. This group became known as Women\u2019s Ordination Worldwide (WOW), and serves as an international resource to all. Three international WOW conferences have taken place in 2001 and 2005, and 2015. Strategies for finding ordaining male bishops were shared among WOW groups. The result was that what had not produced results on one continent (North America), did so on another (Europe). Catholic bishops were found who were willing to ordain women, and thus the movement was born on the Danube River.*",

Arrogant.\n\nFormer Protestant here - there is a lot of use of the word 'catholic' with an honest, well meaning, but very different intention than what Rome means by that word.  We always made some careful, linguistic distinction, like using a lower case 'c' when reciting the Creeds.  We never added 'Roman' and actually intended 'The Roman Church' as a bit of a dig against Catholicism.  The implication was you/we started as the True Church, then lots of the dominant culture of the Roman empire + power grabbing politics got assimilated, so now you/we went from 'The Church' to 'The Roman Church'.

When I read about this article yesterday, I literally laughed off because those are actually students from a prestigious Catholic school and I can't believe that he asked the Pope to allow divorce in our country when even the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) cannot even stop the bill from becoming into law should our president approve this. What's more interesting here is that, each time there are moral issues to be debated like divorce, same-sex marriage, abortion, etc. the progressives would usually use the \"Separation of Church and State\" card literally telling religious people to stop using religion in matters concerning these issues, yet here they are asking the Pope to do something which obviously he has no authority.",

            "When I was a university student, my professor admitted that our school had a diversity quota. They had to include and represent at least one hundred foreign transfer students in their curriculum for cultural diversity purposes. This was because the university was located in a small, rural area. The idea was to help the local students learn about different cultures. I wish I were making this up, but the expressions the professor used were even more blunt. Most liberal arts universities, whether private or public, have similar agendas. Why? Because educational departments and administrations impose these quotas on schools in exchange for funding. Private schools often follow this for the same reason: affluent, typically more liberal donors. I don't know how much of this is policy and how much is mandated, but regardless...\n\nI tend to agree with you on this. It seems terribly ironic to select that particular student to represent and reflect the interests of other students and the university as a whole by offering them a position on that panel. I understand the desire to be inclusive and provide diverse perspectives, but ultimately, I question the value of this compared to the majority census at a CATHOLIC university. If I were a donor, I would want the university to express CATHOLIC ideology, not secular ideology. Unfortunately, that's not what happened. Maybe the student had a right to express their opinions, but was it the proper forum for it? What good did it do, except generate publicity through controversy? That\u2019s the issue. Pope Francis has never 'scandalized' me, if you will. It\u2019s the cheap tactics others use against him that should be scrutinized because they actively attempt to undermine our faith by using individuals who claim to be Catholic but sound like modernists.",

            "Your therapist\u2019s comment reflects a misunderstanding that is unfortunately quite pervasive in the broader culture. The Catholic church isn\u2019t concerned with promoting guilt per se. Catholic faith, however, IS centered on belief in a God who is \u201cpersonal\u201d (actually the 3 Divine Persons of the Trinity united in perfect love) so not merely a conception of some ultimate but impersonal sort of goodness or \u201chigher power.\u201d (Buddhism, for example, is not centered on a personal deity.) Consequently, Judaism, most forms of Christianity, and Islam\u2014as the 3 major world religions that claim the ancient Hebrew leader Abraham as a key figure\u2014all emphasize each individual\u2019s accountability to God-as-Person. \u201cAccountability\u201d doesn\u2019t equate to \u201cguilt.\u201d It\u2019s a way of recognizing the special dignity we enjoy as beings who can choose (or refuse) to reflect God\u2019s own perfect goodness and love.",

When we talked about important struggles, I\u2019d approach it with a faith perspective, and he\u2019d often ask me to not do that, but approach it normally. I tried explaining that my faith isn\u2019t compartmentalized, and that everything in my life has something to do with my faith, and he didn\u2019t agree. I once mentioned God when we were talking about unconditional love, and he disagreed and said it sounds like I have to do a lot to earn Gods love. This was through Catholic Charities.

But I reached a point where I needed to be able to speak more freely without educating so I switched to a therapist who would understand where I am coming from. If she hadn\u2019t been willing to try to humbly learn about my faith, it wouldn\u2019t have been good, possibly harmful. \n\nCould be worth reflecting on what guilt does mean to you, and what God\u2019s mercy means to you and trying to express that.

But within a couple years of being Catholic the possibility of falling out of a state of grace and losing all charity in my soul in one instant by one action really weighed on me, and I became very scrupulous and focused on sin and guilt in unhealthy ways. Then I found some other Catholics who had these obsessive tendencies as well, and we encouraged them in each other and made it worse.\n\nIt was highly detrimental to my mental health, and ironically the mindset was ineffective at growing in love to overcome sin. But I broke out of that within a couple years and began healing over more years. And I have since met more Catholics with much healthier perspectives.\n\nSo from my experience the \u201cCatholic guilt\u201d stereotype is not a complete myth and something to watch out for, but it is not universal for all Catholics.",

And yet we know psychology isn\u2019t always amenable to faith.  It can be really helpful, and I encourage anyone struggling to go to therapy, but we can\u2019t neglect our duty imho to define what is and isn\u2019t sin.

            "Yes especially if OCD or anxiety is an issue. I can\u2019t lie, I know *many* Catholics who have struggled with scrupulosity or OCD-like tendencies at one time or another, myself included. \n\nNot every Catholic struggles in this way, and for some it\u2019s just a passing phase, but it is a real issue for some.",
            "I think it's fair to say that there is a big focus on guilt in Catholicism. That's for a reason, but the claim that guilt is a big thing here, is not wrong. We have obligatory confession, where you are required to examine your conscience and make a list of sins you are guilty of, and then confess them to someone who has the authority to tell you how wrong you were for those sins. We have the Confiteor, where we admit our guilt at Mass on Sundays (\"through my fault\" etc), we have recommendations for a nightly examination of conscience, and we have the extremely strict \"rules\" where a lot of things that are considered \"normal\" in modern culture are considered sinful in the Catholic Church. So in that sense, she's not wrong.\n\nObviously, in another sense, she's wrong. We admit guilt so that we can enjoy the mercy of Christ and be cleansed of our sins. Going to confession, in addition to being theologically required, is a huge source of comfort for many people. Also, guilt is not something invented by the Catholic Church. It's something we evolved with. If there were no Catholic Church, we would just feel guilty about different stuff, but here's the thing: with no possibility of redemption. \n\nI do think that cradle Catholics can go overboard on guilt and sometimes we focus more on looking inward and ruminating on our own faults and on how poorly we are doing, rather than focusing on Christ and His redemptive power.",
            "The problem with secular guilt is that there is no true redemption. Because there is no one to redeem you. You might be told that you are forgiven, by your boss, your friends, your social group, but whatever you did will be stored up and used against you later, because the people who are forgiving you are just as flawed as you are.\n\n And, in some (growing) portion of that culture, there isn't even a belief in free will. How can you be forgiven for your actions if you never freely chose to do them? Instead, you're doomed to being told that this is just the way you are. Then, depending on whether your flaws match those the culture finds acceptable, you are either told that you don't need to change (and therefore you should keep doing the very same things that have been making you miserable) or you are told you are a monster and should be cast out of society and fired and have your life ruined because you committed some microaggression that the internet deemed harmful.",
            "I was going to say, I\u2019ve never felt more guilty about literally just existing than when I was away from the church and embraced modern secularism. Things like examining your conscience and going to confession may be interpreted as being guilt-ridden but I\u2019ve found so much freedom and redemption in them.",
            "You're probably right about that. Secular guilt involves the person having to deal with their conscience when they do something that harms someone else. Then they feel a need to make up for it by righting the wrong that they committed, or if it can't be righted, then their conscience feels a need to do beneficial things for humanity to correct the balance.\n\nReligious Catholic guilt is much easier to remedy. You just ask Jesus or a priest to forgive you, and it all goes away.\n\n/sarcasm\n\nI don't like this train of thought because it implies that Catholics are morally lazy and prefer to be religious because it lets one get away with murder and just say, \"Whoops, sorry, love you, God! We good?\" and it all goes away. We need to have accountability to our fellow man or we are a stain on this Earth.",
