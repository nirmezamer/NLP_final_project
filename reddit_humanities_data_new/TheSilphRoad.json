        "content": "# Hey travelers! \n\nIf you have any questions about Pokemon GO (anything from basics to specifics of a certain mechanic), ask here! We also have a wealth of information available in historical posts, so try using the search bar. Or [click the Discord link in our topbar](https://discord.gg/thesilphroad) and head to the #boot\\_camp channel - where helpful travelers are standing by to answer questions.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# What is /r/TheSilphRoad?\n\nThe Silph Road is primarily focused on discoveries and analysis related to Pokemon GO, as well as constructing an in-person network of Pokemon GO enthusiasts. General discussion topics (Jokes, stories, a photo of a recent catch) would likely be better suited for another subreddit, such as a general subreddit like /r/PokemonGO, or /r/Pokemon, or a subreddit with a more specific focus, like /r/PokemonGoSnap, /r/PokemonBuddy, /r/ShinyPokemon, /r/PoGoRaids, /r/TheSilphArena, /r/PokemonGOTrades, /r/PokemonGOFriends, or /r/NianticWayfarer. \n\n**Silph Road Content Policy**\n\nThe Silph Road is **heavily moderated to promote civility/courtesy, and high-quality content and discussion.** You can read our full policies in the sidebar, but don't be surprised if a comment is removed for being rude, cynical, or off-topic. We strive to foster civil discussion about the game. We are first and foremost a network of real people, and this network is being built by volunteers! If you simply want to complain or bring something to Niantic's attention, your post would be better suited elsewhere.\n\n**Research**\n\nThe community culture here also attracts the more analytically-minded element of Pokemon GO. Consequently, the Silph Research group was formed to align this brainpower and leverage the massive Silph datasets that the community can gather. We post our findings in infographics, videos, and walls of text on Reddit. Check out the top bar for [links to the current pools](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/13fwpg8/current_raid_quest_rocket_egg_pools/).\n\n**Final words**\n\nFinally, welcome once more! We're glad to have you join us on the Road :) \n\n\\- The Silph Executives -\n\n[Link to other Questions & Answers posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/?f=flair_name%3A\"Weekly%20Megathread\")",

            "A few things.\n\nFor one, I would familiarize yourself even a little with what Pokemon are good/useful in PvP in general. Kantonian Golem/Graveler aren't really good in PvP. Alolan Golem/Graveler are better, but not spectacular, mostly just used for certain cups/limited formats. [PvPoke.com](https://PvPoke.com) has rankings that may not be the end all be all but are a good starting place for seeing what's good/great and what isn't. If you found a 94% rank Mantine for example? That's good! A 98% rank Houndoom though...? Yeah that's less useful even at a high rank.\n\nRanking/IVs don't actually make a huge difference. An awful PvP IV Lickitung will still likely perform much better than a Rank 1 PvP IV Golem, for example. PvP IVs can be nice for helping you weed out different options. Like if I had a bunch of Gligar, I'd obviously choose one with better PvP IVs over a random poor IV spread of like... 14/2/6 or something. But at the end of the day, they'll perform *very* similarly. IVs will not make a difference in 99.9% of matches. Only a small handful are decided by IV factors.\n\nSpeaking specifically to what Pokemon are good in PvP, typically it is the last stage that is best, but some middle stages are better in the Great League specifically. Sometimes, due to how stats are calculated, middle evolutions may have more bulk than the final, which can be advantageous, and other times they have much better moves. The easiest example is Vigorth, who has a great moveset and stats for Great League PvP, while Slaking is attack-weighted, meaning it's glassy in Great and Ultra, which is bad, and it obviously has much worse moves with the infamously bad fast move, Yawn.\n\nA less obvious example is Porygon2 versus Porygon Z. Both are still niche, but Porygon Z is attack-weighted and glassy, while Porygon2 is quite bulky, and both have comparable movesets, so Porygon2 is better in PvP usually. Bulk is often the name of the game in PvP",

Can easily get 3 million stardust per season (90 day period) that way.\n\nAdd people from r/PokemonGoFriends and open the daily maximum gifts, that should give you a bunch of healing items.

End of season rewards a chunk of dust which folks use their Starpieces on.\n\nSpeaking of, I wouldn't necessarily pop a Starpiece in the day-to-day and they're better off saved for instances where you can expect a sizable Stardust income, like during raid focused events from a Go Fest or Go Tour, the aformentioned GBL end of season rewards, or bonus catch Stardust events like spotlight hours or certain community days.\n\n\nIn addition, it's nice to have but not a requirement but the Go Plus Plus can award Stardust for sleep tracking, it's not a whole lot just a few thousand or so a day but it's an additional source of Stardust if you don't mind the $50-60 price tag (or can justify the device' higher QoL in terms of auto catching peripherals to buy one, modified or vanilla).\n\nAs for healing items, spin Gyms. They typically award healing items more often than Balls or other rewards. If you have several Great Buddy tier Pokemon or higher you could rotate through them for their buddy gift which can also award revives and super potions, but also a handful of Balls or a few berries.

            "For raids and master league PvP, generally the one of those 3 with highest attack is going to be best.\n\nFor raids that's literally the only IV that matters. And even then only barely in edge cases where the battle is very close with your given party size. Maximizing attack means you miss out on fewer (if any) fast attack break points against key bosses, which can sometimes cost half a percent or so of overall performance.\n\nThough keep in mind that Yveltal isn't really that amazing as a raid counter. It is very average as a dark type, and as a flying type you need to invest an ETM to get oblivion wing. But that's not really worth it given how few raid bosses we actually use flying against (only 3), aside from the random mega rayquaza that shows up outside of double weak cases.\n\nIn PvP you might care a little more about defense too for key matchups because defensive bulk points (opposite of fast attack break points) can come into play in close matches. You can check the battle simulator on [pvpoke.com](https://pvpoke.com/rankings/all/10000/overall/yveltal/) to compare the specific IV spreads you have against the meta, to see if any of them are much different. High level PvP is less forgiving of not having near-perfect pokemon, but that only really matters at legendary rankings. Less sweaty play doesn't really matter that much on a few IV points.\n\nFor lower level leagues, though, you generally want to trade your legendaries to go for low attack, high defense and stamina. Getting in more levels for overall higher total stats tends to work better than something with 15 attack. Unless the species maxes out below 2500 or 1500 and you want close to a hundo, ofc.

If I can only have one, which fusion would be better to have?\n\nSo long as you get the energy required, and have both enough Necrozma candy and enough Cosmog candy, yes you will be able to fuse Necrozma, and you're not limited to just one.\n\nDusk Mane is a significant upgrade over both Shadow Metagross and the currently unreleased Mega Metagross.\n\nDawn Wings is the best Ghost attacker, though it does have competition from Mega Tyranitar where Ghost and Dark are both super effective (which is a common occurrence given that they both hit Psychic and Ghost types for super effective damage).\n\nWith the above said, it is also worth noting that Ghost is generally more of a useful type than Steel when it comes to raids. \n\n>Also given that we have other fusion pokemon, are black and white kyurem in the game yet? If so how good are they? Do you catch them like regular Pokemon or can you fuse kyurem?\n\nThey were accidentally in the game and could be caught in their fused forms during their accidental release. However, Niantic fixed this bug very quickly and turned any Black or White Kyurem that were caught during that time into regular Kyurem. Data mining shows it will have the same fusion mechanic as Necrozma, but currently the fusion mechanic isn't available for it, and I don't forsee it dropping until at least next year at the earliest (could potentially be a Unova Tour thing). Calyrex will also have the fusion mechanic when it eventually becomes available.",
            "* You can get more than one Necrozma fusion, such has been confirmed. You can definitely have at least one of each.\n* Both are technically around the same level of raw power in PvE. I would check out [Teban54's analysis for a more in-depth discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1d4cr0m/analysis_necrozma_with_its_fusion_forms_and/) But:\n   * Ghost usually has more utility across the various raid bosses, specifically T5 raid bosses, seeing that it'll be great against all the Psychic bosses (Mewtwo, Lugia, Lake Trio, Tapu Lele, Deoxys forms, Cresselia) PLUS Ghost bosses like Giratina and Blacephalon. **HOWEVER,** there is a much greater variety of good Ghost and Dark bosses who are great. I say Dark because you can use either type interchangeably 98% of the time. So while it's good, things like Mega/Shadow Tyranitar, Mega Gengar, Mega Houndoom, Hydreigon, Shadow Chandelure, and Shadow Force Giratina are all great attackers. Still though, Dawn Wings is best.\n   * Steel has less utility against raid bosses. It's more limited, being good for Regirock, Regice, Kyurem, Zacian, Tapu Lele, and a few others). That said, that list isn't small either. So it still has good utility. Plus, Metagross's Shadow/Mega/normal forms are basically the top Steel Attackers with less competition, so this makes for a nice Steel Attacker that isn't a Metagross.\n\nIf you were to choose one, I'd choose Dawn Wings by a slim margin, but one could easily argue for Dusk Mane.\n\n* For Kyurem's Fusions, they are not in the game yet, and we don't know how they'll work. However, they were datamined in such a way that they look like they'll work the same as Nerozma's fusions. Same with the future Calyrex mounts. But yes, presumably whenever they do debut, we'll likely fuse Kyurem just like Necrozma. The leading theory is that the Kyurem fusions will debut during the presumed Unova Tour in February 2025.",

            "I forgot about that event, thank you. I do have mega Pidgeot and Beedrill right now so I am familiar with the mechanics but afaik those are the two easiest ones to get",
            "I actually do use mainly PokeBattler for raid counters, but I like the little blurbs on gamepress where it basically tells you if a mon is useful or not, and the explanation of which moves are best",
            "Are you using iPhone or Android?\n\nI don't see how it's \"pretty clear\" if half the time it's white and half the time it's a very dim yellow.  \n\nIf traffic lights worked like that would you call them \"pretty clear\"?",
            "Good to know, thank you! And sorry you had to find out ;-(",
            "Thank you!",
            "Yea cuz basically you have to either use Elite TMs or just wait till December.",
            "Ig but the most practical way is just hold onto your Metang, or Charmeleon and just don\u2019t evolve it till December. Still not much interaction just push the button you have your move. It\u2019s not like it needs to be the one caught on Cday.",
            "Yup it\u2019s until September 30 so should be good",
            "I had 17 balls, one throw was excellent with a golden berry, and most of the others with gold berries and great throws. I really hope it will work out next time. But the circle never changed from dark red to a lighter colour. I'm level 34, maybe it has also something to do with that, but our team player who caught him is level 26",
            "Thank you for the info, nah we were on a park bench. I just hope I get lucky too then I guess some day.",
            "I can just use a charged TM on it right?",
            "In general it's better to wait until you actually need to use them to power them up. We don't know very far in advance when bosses are coming next, so having the dust in the bank let's you power up what you actually need.\n\nGet them ready, tag them with something, and just do the final step as needed.",
            "Yeah yeah, I\u2019m not exactly sure because whenever I tap on the widget it just opens go. So it\u2019s not like you can incubate eggs without opening the app. I\u2019ll just incubate 1 tomorrow and see how it goes if not then there\u2019s probably some way to get 1/4 hatch distance.",
            "No stacking. Just 3 at 1/4 hatch distance and then 1/2 hatch distance for the others. I remember last time there was an event like this there was some instances of stacking but it was only some accounts that had it and I think it was a bug, so I wouldn't count on it happening this time.",
            "Unless you're willing to get fancy, you don't.",
            "Magearna you can get from Home. You need to register all generation 1-8 Pok\u00e9mon in the Home dex. Obviously that requires you already having had a Magearna and the other species you mentioned, but you could temporarily borrow them for the Home dex and then trade them back to their owners",
            "Ah I see what you mean. They do mythical distributions randomly through the years. \n\nThey did a year of distributing every Mythical in 2016 for the 20th anniversary of the franchise, so maybe we'll see something similar for the 30th anniversary?",
            "So in my experience 3 = can't get more /claim code\nBut if you have 1 or 2 it'll allow you to buy (or in this case, claim) 3 more giving you a max of 5 in inventory. Save having to wait to claim the code.",
            "I don't think level does anything\n\nUsually I only go for excellent throws on legendaries, both because catch rate is already low but also because their circles are so big that it's much easier to hit excellents on them anyways",
            "Not to remove Frustration, you can\u2019t remove frustration off a pokemon until the \u201cTeam Rocket Takeover\u201d event. When that\u2019s on you can use a TM :)",

Got _a bunch_ of incubators but I\u2019m really going 1-2 at a time at most, trying to make sure I have 3 hatch one egg tasks (hatch 3 eggs also fine as Turto is boosted) between each hatch. \n\nSo far 0/24 Slugmas, 0/3 Turtos and one Charcadet & Larvesta each, not too bad so far.",

With 1 infinity incubator and 5 slow incubators, I might get something good for the work by the end of the event but if I don\u2019t, I\u2019m not going to worry about it.\n\nDisappointed with the Pok\u00e9mon rewards from the field research though\u2026.",

            "Thoughts on whether to farm 2, 5, or 10 km eggs.  Not sure if it\u2019s worth going for 10s as I already have three Charcadet and suspect they\u2019ll be mostly turtonators anyways. \n\n2s and 5s look mostly good expect the growlithes which I already have both shiny\u2026.\n\nAppreciate thoughts",
            "I waited until after 10 to put a new egg in an incubator. Already had the game loaded from before 10, so I just switched over to the app and threw a 2k in my infinite. Became 0.5k. I haven't used the widget since the last egg event like this, so I was a little surprised.\n\nI closed the app and used the widget to open it and place more eggs in incubators. Only got 2 more at 1/4 distance; the third that I placed through the widget was at 1/2 distance.\n\nHad this happened to anyone else?",
            "Hatch 3 task gives Turtonator",

            "Well, it shouldn\u2019t. The egg pools for this event show that Larvesta\u2019s been boosted from Tier 5 to Tier 3 (in 2k and 5k) and Tier 1 (in 10k). So they\u2019ve learned.",
            "It wasn\u2019t enabled at the start of the event. They got a lot of bad press from it and then suddenly they were being hatched left right and centre.",

            "Save them for Go Fest, especially if you're a ticket holder.\n\nWhat will they have in it? If judging by last year was a sign then:\n\nMaractus, Corsolla, Rockruff, Vullaby, the new shinies from the 3 in person go fests maybe? maybe costumed eevee/pikachu, jangmo-o... more or less some variation of these, just a guess based on how they usually operate",
            "Are there good egg pools during global go fest?",

            "Unova tour in 8 months",
            "What if I just want to hatch eggs quicker, earn dust, and get more Charcadet and I\u2019m fully prepared to not get shiny Larvesta. It will be a CD I am very sure but im hatching eggs regardless so may as well when the pool is more interesting.",
            "We do this every year\n\nRare shiny gets added in egg event\n\nPeople complain about it\u00a0\n\nGets made easier in future event\n\nPeople complain about it\n\nGets a com day\n\nPeople complain about it\n\nRinse and repeat\u00a0\n\nHonestly this is a common trend and it\u2019s so boring to watch this happen for essentially happen for what, 6th time now is it? Niantic wins here as whales gonna spend bucket loads trying to hatch 2 and a good one, niantic had 0 reason to stop here either\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s becoming a bore at this point watching this happen all the time\u00a0",
            "Why so negative? Many people save incubators up for events like this, and it is a guaranteed outcome, one of the Pok\u00e9mon in the egg pool lol.  The 10 km is theoretically a 2/3 chance of larvesta or charcadet and only 2.5 km to hatch.\n\nEven without buying incubators, a 1/4 egg hatch event is a great reason to get out and walk.\n\n The event also includes specific field research tasks.  \n\nAnd while I may eat these words, I highly doubt larvesta is ever a CD Pok\u00e9mon, Niantic will keep it in eggs",
            "I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll make larvesta a comm day mon in the next year but that would be amaaazing. I hope you\u2019re right.",
            "I don't think it's the shiny odds that will be bad (If Larvesta gets a 1/64, and remains an egg-exclusive pokemon for the foreseeable future). I think the issue will be just getting Larvesta to begin with. That, combined with a 1/64 odds, is what I think will make shiny Larvesta \"especially fortunate\".",
            "Full odds or 256",
            "Plus 1 to this\u2026the 10km are obviously quite attractive now that they\u2019re \u201cequal\u201d probability of charcadet, larvesta, turt. Anyone gotten a few of these and have tips? I know it\u2019s normally random.",
            "It seems really low for us. We hatched a couple of batches here and we averaged around 0-2 per batch( 9 eggs a batch).",
            "What do you mean another? This is the first event since the Sustainability Week (which overlapped with Kanto) that did not feature different wild spawns.  \n  \nPeople have expressed how irrelevant seasonal spawns have become as there's events happening almost daily. This is a good compromise to go for seasonal spawns while not sitting with the same event spawns for 5 days",
            "They never said that there would be wild spawns with this event.",
            "Correct",
            "Tap the widget to have it load PoGo straight to the egg screen then incubate.",
            "In the past it\u2019s applied even when you weren\u2019t using the widget. I hope someone can confirm if that\u2019s happening here. I\u2019d rather save my 1/4 for when I get 10k eggs.\u00a0",

            "Catch mons, enjoy outside, raid or PvP\u2026",
            "On the flipside, it's the one event where you can mostly do it by putting your phone in your pocket and simply enjoying being outside (unless you're on the East Coast and it's 100 degrees)",
            "Keep in mind that there were pokemon in the previous 2 tours that were egglocked!",

            "I am a little worried larvesta/charcadet do not actually have the same odds as turtonator out of 10k eggs",
            "Yup! Any eggs you receive after 10am local time will be the event eggs.",
            "Its a widget for pokemon go",
            "Yes. It's similar to ones like Galarian Weezing, Druddigon, Bombirdier, etc., where they released as 3* Raids only and are perma-boosted Shiny odds",
            "But is that this a good hatch event? Is it really though????",
            "The solution to this is to delete the widget until you find a 10k egg then add widget again. Learned the hard way and wasted it on a 2k egg",
            "You can't choose which to farm. Eggs from stops are random, so you'll get what you're given. I wouldn't bother spending incubators on this event personally anyway.",
            "The first three eggs you incubate through the widget get quarter hatch distance, the rest are all half.",
            "They're shiny boosted in research.",
            "Could you tell me what tier Charcadet is in 10km eggs?",
            "Good to see they did. I remember the community hating them after this sub did the research on it. Personally I'm going to wait for it's CD but good luck to anyone that is playing the egg game.",
            "Boosting doesn't mean increased chances.",
            "Eh 2k is the way to go if you look at distance needed to walk.    With 3 in the pool at 10k you'll need to walk an average of 30km for every Larvesta.  With 5 in the pool at 2km you'll need to walk an average if 10km for every Larvesta.\n\n5km is thw worst at an average of 25km per Larvesta.",
            "It would be interesting if they put the costume eevees in the eggs since they won\u2019t be available in the wild. \u00a0Honestly I\u2019m trying to decide if those options would even be worth it over Charcadet and Larvesta now especially if the Rockruff might not be able to evolve into the dusk form",
            "All the website says is there will be event 7kms for ticket holders. \u00a0There\u2019s no info on what will be in them",

            "Not everything Is boosted at tour events though. But a community day is likely at some point",
            "I'm happy to do hatch events occasionally. Last one I did was Hisui Sneasal when it released, and before that for Yamask in 2022. That one I was like you, just wanted candy and xl for UL cofa and rune.\n\nThis time is the same, finally a chance to get enough candy to evolve larvesta and hopefully get 2 female charca for the dex. \n\nIf people complain they're just silly. Reminds me (although not quite as bad) as a few Lego fans complaining Captain rex is in a cheap set after being paywalled into a $1000 set. Like exclusivity sucks, even for a collecting game like this. Personally I don't like every shiny being too common, but I'd welcome a larvesta spotlight hr, just want a way to get XL for it",

When you have an egg slot and spin, the computer rolls some dice, and the species is determined by that roll - niantic set those odds per-species, and whatever species you get, is given the appropriate egg colour/distance for that species.  The main caveat is what happens in this event, where larvesta is in all the eggs, they do some extra voodoo there to allow it to appear with different shells.  None of that is predicated on gym vs pokestop spin though.",

So it might just be poorly coded to let the first three incubated eggs be 1/4, and the rest half.",
            "Do we know if all chances in one egg-tier are the same or can they differ? So for example say 30% Charcadet, 50% Turtonator and 20% Larvesta",
            "I should clarify: Just because they're available other egg groups doesn't mean the hatch rate is boosted; Larvesta was already available in these egg groups and it's still at the lowest rarity hatch. 1% to 5% really doesn't mean anything, as weve seen with Riolu and Deino before.",
            "What about Catching Wonders? That event had no overlap and also no event spawns as well.",
            "Actually, I just realised it was doing 1/4 distance for ANY eggs. Not just ones after you click the widget. (As I hadn't even set up the widget until I was ready).\n\nWasted it on 2km eggs because I was trying to get rid of them to use it for my 10km :(\n\nDidn't even click that 0.5km isn't half 2km. D'oh.",
            "Yeah, image paying irl money to get 3 tortunators",

            "They can absolutely differ, that person is mistaken. Now, they *might* be equally distributed because they have done that before but they've also had unequal distribution. There is no set pattern Niantic adheres to when it comes to egg pools and we simply won't know until data is gathered and examined.\n\nIf I were to hazard a guess, I'd say the answer might (keyword) rely on whether purple eggs are more or less common than normal. If they're more common, I'd probably expect more Turtonator and Charcadet since Larvesta is also available in 2k and 5k eggs but if 10k eggs are less common then they might bump up the Larvesta rate in them. But that's ultimately just a guess and Niantic has been favorable with egg pools before in the past. Every hatch event is always just a big question mark going into it and we kind of figure it out as we go.",
            "Each tier is a percentage range, and inside that tier each Pokemon can vary. 1-egg tier is 10% and up.\u00a0",
            "> 1% to 5% really doesn't mean anything\n\nWouldn't that be a 500% increase in drop rate?  Hardly nothing but i get it, I went through hundreds of eggs before I got a Larvesta.",
            "I\u2019m not sure if you understand: in the 10k eggs during this event, all 3 egg hatches are in Tier 1, meaning it has a 1/3 chance of being hatched. The other eggs, while not being as common as the others, should still be higher than 1% now.",
            "Yeah that's true. That one indeed had nothing going for it in terms of Pokemon spawns, only the masterwork research and non-encounter field researches",
            "Ooh, so the process change from last time. That's less than ideal - used to be able to control it more.",
            "fwiw this happened to me as well. My guess was that because I had the widget enabled it didn\u2019t matter that I didn\u2019t open through the widget",
            "Eh, it all depends on context. 1 penny to 5 pennies is also a 500% increase, doesnt mean its significant. Also, it's only  400%.",
            "It\u2019s not 1/3 chance, it\u2019s minimum 10%. So it could be Larvesta 10%, Charcadet 20%, Turtonator 70% for all we know.\u00a0",
            "No, it's not 10%, let's tap the breaks there.",

It's clearly not FF Reshiram but it's not so far behind everything you feel like you're sandbagging the raid to use it and in Bug it's quite good and only sits behind the glass cannon Pheromosa and a couple of Megas.\n\nI lucky traded for a 14/15/14 not long after it was released and I pumped RC into it and took it to 40 and enjoy using it for some variety in raids. I've since hatched a hundo and a few 98s and am sitting at 1200 candy or so, going to bide my time and see what Fiery Dance might bring for it on CD.\n\nIf you get a good one, use it and enjoy it.

If you have 60 berries and feed all of them in a gym, you have a good chance to get candy. \nFor me that\u2019s pretty basic.\n\nNot rare at all. XL candy is another matter, but it happens to, if you didn\u2019t know.",
