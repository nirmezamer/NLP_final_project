The biggest differences to me honestly are the right-click context menu and the movement of the tab search button - with the added annoyance of the increase in padding and whitespace in basically _every_ menu and panel. Everything takes up more space that should be used for web content, everything takes double the time to scroll or click through (not to mention the new fade-in animation for the context menu that takes an eternity), and everything just looks worse, less like every other UI element in my system. It's also not quite as apparent, but the disappearance of the tab separators when hovering is a bit annoying - everything is just bubbles now.",
            "It depends on when you last used it and what you're used to.\n\nThe big deal when Refresh was implemented last year is the wasted space which arguably makes sense on mobile because you don't have a pinpoint accurate cursor there. This is obvious when looking at the gaps between items in the context menu, bookmark folders, and the 3 dots menu. At least the font is no longer bold so it's generally more pleasant to look at.\n\nThen there's the color. Your choice now recolors more than just the title bar. Remember how Windows lets you match title bars with your accent color? Imagine if the rest of the user interface vaguely followed suit. I can see myself getting used to it but it's bizarre that there's no toggle for this.\n\nFinally, we now have this big button in the top left to search for tabs. It stands out unnecessarily due to the current color behavior. Even if it didn't though, users want to remove it because they're either used to clicking there to drag the window or because this is where their most frequently visited tab used to be located, so at least there will soon be an option to display this button on the far right instead.\n\nThere's some more minor stuff like how the separators between tabs don't look so great on certain colors or how menus fade into existence but that about covers it.",
