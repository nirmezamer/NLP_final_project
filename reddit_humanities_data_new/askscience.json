The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/15186wx/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxiv/).\n\nThe panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.\n\nMembership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**\n\n* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,\n* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**\n\n* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).\n* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)\n* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)\n* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?\n* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.\n\n\\-------------------\n\nIdeally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.\n\nHere's an example application:\n\n`Username: /u/foretopsail`\n\n`General field: Anthropology`\n\n`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`\n\n`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`\n\n`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`\n\n`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`\n\nPlease do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.\n\nYou can submit your application by replying to this post.",

            "Worth adding that human birth rates slightly favor men\n\nApproximately 51/49.\n\nOvertime, men tend to take riskier behaviours which get them killed and overtime leads to women outnumbering men around the 30 year mark.",
            "There are evolutionary pressures for the ratio of females to males to be close to 1:1 in many species (not all), including humans.  This is explained by [Fisher's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_principle).  Briefly: if the population skews female, there are reproductive advantages to being male and those genes favoring males being born are thus favored by natural selection. As a result more males are born, evening things out again.  It also works in the opposite direction.\n\nIn reality, cultural and historical contingencies like war, mean maternal age, etc. have some impact on these numbers, so they vary a bit (sometimes dramatically) for different times and places in human history.  However, in the long term the \\~1:1 ratio is a stable one that evolution tends toward in humans.\n\nEdit: it\u2019s worth noting that a [2020 study](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2019.2849) did not find any significant heritability of sex ratio in humans.  The authors conclude that Fisher\u2019s Principle does not explain sex ratio in humans at present.  This interpretation has been [disputed](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2020.2632), though (here\u2019s [another paper](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2020.2638) calling this conclusion into question).  It may be most accurate to say that this study did not provide evidence for Fisher\u2019s Principle in humans, not that it falsified it.  In any case, as always with science, we should take any truth as provisional and not absolute.\n\nEdit 2: a more complete explanation would include the fact that, unless there are specific reasons (selective pressures) for a male to produce an imbalanced number of X and Y sperm, the default ratio of X and Y sperm will be 1:1 because of the structure of the genome and how meiosis works.  The default ratio of males to females born will thus be close to 1:1, all else being equal.  Fisher's Principle would tell us that if this default situation already exists on evolutionary timescales, there is no reason for a genetic bias towards male or female offspring to emerge.  This may be why we see inconsistent evidence of any such biases in humans -- while gender imbalance has existed in various populations in history, these may not have been longstanding enough to have an influence on evolution of genes that might influence sex ratio within most human populations.",
            "The supply of humans is approximately 50% male and female (as sperms have equal probability of containing X or Y chromosomes). Unless something drastic happens like a war (mostly males get killed) or female infanticide (culture causes killing of female babies), biologically there is nothing to prefer either sex.",
            "The 50/50 ratio follows from how chromosomes are distributed among gametes. You can draw out all possible ways that sperms and eggs can mix in order to see this.\n\nEggs and sperms essentially only carry one sex chromosome, because they are formed from a parent cell whose genome essentially split in half (called meiosis). Because females are XX, their eggs will always carry an X chromosome, as the parent cell will be XX, so that's all you can get. Because males are XY, whenever a parent cell splits to form sperms, it will always create one X sperm and one Y sperm.\n\nSince the egg will always have an X (except for certain rare exceptions), this X or Y sperm will essentially determine the sex of the child (except for certain rare exceptions). Hence, the probability of having a male or female child is going to be 50%, because the process that generates sperm will always make 1 X and 1 Y sperm.",
            "Just a quick note to say that 50:50 male:female isn't necessarily the case!\u00a0\n\n\nThere exists selective pressure for sex-determining chromosomes to compete with each other to favour their transmission (e.g. it is advantageous for X chromosome linked genes to inhibit Y chromosome carrying sperm to increase how many X chromosomes are passed on).\n\n\nThis is called intragenomic conflict and can distort the sex ratio equilibrium, that as others have pointed out would otherwise lead to a 50:50 ratio by the law of large numbers.\u00a0\n\n\nFurther reading:\n\n\n\nPress piece on \"first evidence in mammals of a battle between the X and Y chromosomes\" : https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2012-09-13-sex-chromosome-battle-leads-to-more-female-mice\n\n\nMathematical biology paper on maternal sex ratio disorders: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ece3.2498\n\n\nReview paper from 2014 on sex chromosome evolution and Intragenomic conflict: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4292157/",
            "Because there is a roughly equal chance that a given child will be male or female. \n\n>Why hasn't one sex increased/decreased significantly over another?\n\nThere would need to be some underlying reason for there to be an increase/decrease among one over the other.  \n\nOne example is China's previous 1 Child Policy.  Due to cultural elements male children were considered more important/valuable, so many female children were abandoned or outright killed so the parents could try again or a male child.  At its peak the imbalance was 120 males per 100 females.  But even that was limited within a specific age range.",
            "Because the chance of fertilization resulting in a male or female is also 50/50 because the distribution of X and Y chromosomes is also 50/50, because that's what male's testicles are programmed to do. If that programming changed so would the human population distribution.",
            "The Law of Large Numbers.  Basically, there is a 50/50 chance (not quite, but close enough) for a sperm cell to be an X or a Y.  So there's a 50/50 chance that an egg is fertilized with an X or a Y chromosome.  Flip a coin a couple billion times and the result will be very close to 50% heads and 50% tails.  Fertilize a few billion eggs and it's going to average out very closely to 50% male and 50% female.\n\n\\*\\*For the sake of this conversation I am ignoring the \\~1.7% intersex population and simply using XX and XY definitions.  Sex and gender are more complicated than that.",
            "Generally any species with a mostly binary sex distribution will tend towards 50/50. There are many reasons but one of the most prominent is sexual selection. If females outnumber males, each male will have more partners and have more children making male children more advantageous. This advantage will drive the ratio back towards 50/50. The same process happens when males outnumber females but for slightly different reasons",
            "Statistics. Flip a coin five times, and there's a good chance that the results will be overwhelmingly heads or tails. But if you flip a coin ten thousand times, the results *will* be very close to 50-50. The more times a random event happens, the closer the results will be to the average. This is a concept known as \"regression to the mean\".\n\nIn terms of human reproduction, individual families have a reasonable chance of being overwhelmingly male or overwhelmingly female because it's about a 50-50 chance (yes I know it's more complicated than that) but it's a small sample size, often of just one or two children. But on a global scale of *billions* of children, it is astronomically unlikely to have a significant deviation from the average.",
            "Human egg cells have one X chromosome. Each sperm cell has either an X or a Y chromosome.  Both of these types of sperm cells are equally likely to fertilize the egg, resulting in 50% XY chromosomes (male), and 50% XX chromosomes (female).    \nHere's a source from google that appears to be a chapter outline from a biology textbook I'm pretty sure I once used lol.  \n[https://www.etsu.edu/uschool/faculty/tadlockd/documents/bio\\_chpt14sec1show.pdf](https://www.etsu.edu/uschool/faculty/tadlockd/documents/bio_chpt14sec1show.pdf)",
            "Purely from a statistical standpoint. The chances a child is a boy or girl are 50:50. And to reproduce you need a mate of the opposite sex. (Ignoring other means). If the population is 60/40 male 33% of males become less likely to produce offspring. So their lines die out while everyone else is producing roughly 50:50 boys and girls",
            "Regression to the mean. As long as men and women are born at approximately the same rate (which they are), you'd expect the population to approach 50/50. Even if you, say, killed a hugely disproportionate number of men in a war, it would only temporarily lower the proportion of men.\n\nThis effect is made even stronger by the fact that everyone dies eventually and therefore disruptions to the 50/50 ratio don't just get overwhelmed by new people, they actually go away.",
            "If there is a 50% chance of a certain outcome, the more opportunities you give for that outcome to happen (in this case, the more births that take place), the closer the results are going to trend to that 50%. You might get variations of a percent or two at certain points, but without some outside pressure, you won't see any wild variance.",
            "Because XX chromosomes make you female, XY chromosomes make you male. The mother\u2019s egg passes on one of her X chromosomes, which the fathers sperm has a 50/50 chance of passing on his X chromosome (resulting in an XX combination) or passing on his Y chromosome (resulting in an XY combination).",
            "It's nearly always that way with sexual reproduction. If you have fewer of one sex the odds go up of passing on your genes. The odds of getting the less common sex keep going up until it's no longer an advantage against the rest of the species. Without other factors the two sit at about 50/50. This isn't always true (looking at you anglerfish) because it's more complicated than that in practice but it's the simple answer.",
            "Because during the creation of sperm cells, in a process called meiosis, the two sex chromosomes - X and Y - are evenly distributed into each new sperm cell.\n\n\n\nThis means as each new sperm cell either has just 1 X chromosome or just 1 Y chromosome + one copy of the other 22* chromosomes (sperm and egg cells are different to 'normal' body cells, a.k.a. somatic cells, in that they only have half the complement of chromosomes).\n\n\nThis creates equal proportion of X containing sperm - that will go on to create a female if they fertilize an egg (all egg cells are X, as females are XX, and so only produce eggs that are X) - and Y containing sperm - that will go on to create a male (XY) they fertilize an egg.\n\n\nMale body cells are XY, and so create sperm cells that are either X, or Y in a 50/50 proportion.\n\n\nFemale body cells are XX, and so all eggs are X.\n\n\nBecause half of sperm cells are X and the other half are Y, 50% of offspring are female and 50% are male.\n\n\nSex (being male or female) isn't hereditary / 'passed down'. Sexual reproduction requires a male and a female, and the resulting offspring are always 50% chance of being male or female (with tiny exceptions of intersex or other chromosomal rarities).",
            "It's not there are slightly more males than females up untill about age 50 where the male population starts to drop off..\n\nDiffrent factors determine whether a  child is born male or female..but it seems more males are born...but more males die and males don't live aslong as females.\n\nOne war can really alter the sex ratio women tend to be protected from war or the most dangerous jobs...\n\nSo to answer the question high premature death rate and lower life expectancy of men...and it's actually not 50/50 and women are starting to greatly outnumber men in the west.",
            "I guess statistics?  \nBeing born male or female is essentially random with a roughly 50/50, and should be independent from the current ratio of male to female in the population. It should theoretically be possible to have one generation come out heavily in favour of one. However it is exxeedingly unlikely for this to happen.\n\nTo illustrate how unlikely you can write a program to simulate flipping a coint 1000 times, do that ten thousand times in a row and plot the distribution of the outcome. As you increase the number of flips per run to simulate a larger population, the distribution of outcomes becomes tighter and tighter, meaning it's less and less likely to significantly skew towards one sex.",
            "[removed]",
            "Because biologically, there is a strong evolutionary pressure for it to be like that. If there were fewer females, that would decrease the birth rate by population. If there were fewer males, those would need to breed with different females to keep the birth ratez reducing genetical variability and, in the case of humans, less survival of the offspring (the resources that the father provides would be shared between many children, thus reducing their chances to grow properly).\n\nThis would be just considering humans as animals with tribal organisations, not considering social factors",
            "I've heard that the older the pregnant person, the more likely they are to have girls. The thought behind this was that more boys are conceived than girls but the older you are, the more likely you are to miscarry, so if the pregnancy comes to term, it's more likely to be a girl. If this is true, I wonder how populations will change as more people wait to have kids.",
            "When I was studying anthropology, one of the classes they explained this. \n\nIt's not actually 50 -50 but genetically is 51 male to 49 female. \n\nThe reason was men work all the hardest dangerous tasks and fight wars. Men die in very large numbers while women live in a safe world the men create. \n\nIf a tribe of 100 people with 51 men and 49 women. 50 men die in a tribe war or an animal attack. If there's 1 man, he can repopulate the tribe with the 49 women. But if it was the other side, around 1 woman can't re populate tribe and their genetic trait would be snuffed out. Tribes needed slightly more men because men are physically stronger and ensure dangerous events favour the tribe. (Such as wars). \n\nRumours had it that there were Tribes that had more female in them, such as Amazon. However, they needed very luscious fertile land that gave relative free food, so they didn't have to do hard physical hunting or farming. Eventually, when tribal territory wars started, the women would be wiped out in the battlefield. \n\nThe Tribes , 10 million years, only survived if they had this ratio of gender/sex. If it is skewered to be more female, in time, there will be catastrophe such as disease famine , war, or animal attacks. Then they get snuffed out. \n\nWe are the desendants of this ratio of gender/sex ancestors.",

            "Yea riskier behaviors like early onset genetic heart disease and being drafted into wars",
            "\u201cRisky behaviour\u201d is a myth.  \n\nAt fertilization the ratio is 1:1.  Sometime during the first trimester about 1% of female embroyos self terminate.  This happens in all human cultures and is not the result of favouring male children, though that skews ratios further after birth.\n\nAfter birth the ratio is close to 51:49 and very very slowly trends to 50:50 at about age 45.  \n\nAfter age 55 the male mortality increases faster than the female one, but not accross sociodemographic lines.  Among the wealthy the mortality rates between men and women differ little whereas among the poor the rates diverge greatly.\n\nMain killers of young men include suicide, unintentional poisoning and accidents hinting at \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d. There are a few of these, but rates are very much exaggerated in popular culture.   Among older men the big killers include various forms of heart disease and occupationally obtained cancers.  Basically, blue collar work is bad for men\u2019s health because 1) men can\u2019t take breaks when they\u2019re tired and 2) opportunities to obtain health care are prohibitively costly in terms of lost wages.  By age 75 the female to male ratio approaches 2:1.\n\nEssentially, there are a few exceptions but generally men work themselves to death to provide for their families.",
            "The increased testosterone in men leads to an increased chance of prostate cancer, which leads to death.\n\nHow many women do you know that have prostate cancer? That's what I thought.",
            "I like this deeper analysis, kinda also explains why ants and bees have a completely skewed male to female ratio because through Arrhenotoky the female is a 75% clone of each other, so the male is incentivize to let the queen reproduce over reproducing themself, so you just get army of males protecting the queen instead",
            ">Briefly: if the population skews female, there are reproductive advantages to being male and those genes favoring males being born are thus favored by natural selection.\n\nEither I don't understand somwthing or this is stupid. What does that mean?\n\nNatural selection means some favourable trait makes its possessors more likely to breed and pass it on.

Maybe sperm carrying Y chromosomes become a bit faster than those with X chromosomes, making them more likely to reach the egg sooner.  Maybe Y sperm become faster at fusing with the egg.  Or maybe a mutation causes a certain fraction of X sperm to undergo apoptosis and never have a chance to produce offspring, thus enriching the population of sperm in Y chromosomes relative to X.\n\nIn a population with 1:1 males:females, genes favoring the above traits would not be selected for, as they would not confer any advantage.

If any such mutations arose (or already existed in the population at a low level), the people with these genes would have more descendants than those without them, and thus genes favoring male births would become more prevalent in the population over time until there was no longer a reproductive advantage to being male \u2014 probably at something close to a 1:1 ratio.",

You could have a situation where an individual was inclined to have 7/10 male and 3/10 female children.

The point is that if males produced more offspring then having 7 males and 3 females would produce more grandchildren than 5 males and 5 females, if that's what you asked.\n\nHis 7/10 wouldn't reproduce better than the 5/10 normal, that's the entire point. If you had a population where producing 7/10 male children was the norm for everyone this would essentially result in 70% of the population being male and 30% being female. If 70 males and 30 females produce 100 new children (again 70 male and 30 female) this would mean that each female had 3.33 children on average while each male only had 1.43 children. In such an environment it would be massively beneficial genetically to produce female children. Mutations that cause more female children would gain an advantage over time and eventually the genetic pressure would stabilize the population at a point where it's 50/50.\n\nMy post and presumably the one I responded to was more about species where mating isn't done in a pairwise way, such as in elephant seals where males will have a harem of 40-50 females that they mate with. Some people will incorrectly assume that this means the population overall follow a similar ratio, such that 40-50 females are born for every male. However such a situation would not be stable because it would be massively beneficial to have more than 2% of your children be males. Ultimately the balance is reached when children are 50/50 male/female, because in that case it's not beneficial to have more of either sex. It's just that while all females get to mate, 49 out of 50 males are too weak and don't get to mate at all.\n\nI would argue that the way sex is split from the sperm is more of a result than a cause of this [Fisher's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_principle). If it was somehow beneficial to have 90% males and 10% females, nature would find a way to make that happen.",

The guy has *views*. He seems to skew heavily towards attributing behaviors to genetics over social-economic influences. As far as I can tell the consensus is that the data he presents does not support those suppositions over other possible explanations.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Kanazawa\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/22/11/3002/652125?login=false",

The point is that, if such a thing were to happen, it wouldn't last, due to the analysis already given.\n\nBut, for an example, say some random mutation comes along such that, after meiosis in the male, the germ cells now containing an X chromosome preferentially commit apoptosis. And, voila! We're having more boys.",
            "It doesn\u2019t even have to be skewed at the level of sperm production.  If sperm containing X chromosomes were on average 50% faster than those containing Y chromosomes (or 50% more efficient at fusing with the egg, etc.) there would be a significant skew towards females rather than males being born.\n\nBut there are also ways it could be controlled at sperm production.  For example, a regulatory process could result in 50% of sperm cells with Y chromosomes undergoing apoptosis (\u201ccell suicide\u201d) during production, suppressing the number of male zygotes being formed.\n\nEdit: I am aware of at least [one study from 2008 ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11692-008-9046-3)that presented evidence that the tendency of men to produce male or female offspring in greater frequency is heritable; however, a larger, [more recent study](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2019.2849) (albeit in a different population) showed no evidence of heritability of sex ratio.  It seems there is not strong empirical evidence that specific genes play prominent roles in determining how many male/female offspring a person has.  This does not necessarily refute Fisher's Principle but it may place constraints on its scope of applicability in humans.",

            "I don't remember spermatogenesis that well but sperm cells being haploid suggests they go through meiosis which starts precisely how I put it then both sets are separated.\n\nThe point I was making is for a male the ratio of x chromosomes to y chromosomes is 1:1, unless one chromosome was to be multiplied more than the other.\n\nHow would making more Y sperm cells work if every such cell has an X compadre.\n\nHope I made it clearer."

However, the amount of DNA transferred in this manner is typically very small.\n\nExhalation of Foreign DNA: The likelihood of then exhaling this DNA as part of your breath is extremely low.

            "The direct answer to your two questions are - (1) We don't know for sure that there wasn't life on Proto-Earth (or Theia, i.e., the impactor) before the Moon forming impact because (2) Yes, all of the evidence of any life would have been destroyed (on either body) by the impact process. \n\nHowever, it's not considered likely that there would have been life on either body because of the time frames involved. Specifically, the impact of Theia with the Proto-Earth and the subsequent formation of the Moon, happened very early in the history of the solar system. The exact timing has been updated a few times, but recent results from [Greer et al., 2023](https://www.geochemicalperspectivesletters.org/article2334/) suggest that this happened only ~110 million years after the formation of the solar system, or about 4.46 billion years ago. If we consider evidence for formation of life on Earth, whether we're thinking of the oldest preserved microfossils (e.g., [Schopf et al., 2017](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1718063115)) or preservation of biosignatures more broadly (e.g., [Homann et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825219300741)), the earliest dates are ~3.5 billion years ago, i.e., nearly a full billion years after the Moon forming impact. It's hard to extrapolate from a dataset of 1, but if we consider that it took ~1 billion years for life to develop on Earth and that Proto-Earth / Theia as planets had only existed for ~100 million years before they collided, it becomes relatively unlikely that sufficient time had past for life to develop on either body prior to their collision. Even less so if we consider that this early period of the solar system would have been very chaotic, with *lots* of impacts from planetisemals and the like disrupting the surfaces of most every planetary body frequently.\n\nThe above was borrowed from a response in an [earlier thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/17lz6cy/i_was_just_reading_up_on_the_ancient_theia_planet/) that posed a similar question, and some of the discussion besides the part I grabbed from my prior answer might also be interesting or relevant here.",

            "Borrowing again from a [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/qdbx6r/did_theia_actually_smash_into_the_earth_or_is/):\n\nThe canonical view is that the proto-Earth was around 90% of the mass of the current Earth (e.g., [O'Neill, 1991](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0016703791901696)). As described by O'Neill, the general idea is that impactor hits the proto-Earth, the impactor is vaporized along with most of the mantle of the proto-Earth, and that much of this proto-Earth/Theia mixture recondenses to form the modern Earth with the rest forming the Moon. This is generally what is seen in a variety of models of this impact (e.g., [Canup, 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103503002999), [Wada et al., 2006](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/499032/meta), etc).  The requirement of a decent amount of mixing and then this mostly homogeneous material accreting both back onto the Earth and forming the moon is a requirement to honor a variety of geochemical/isotopic constraints (e.g., [Jacobson et al., 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13172), [Young et al., 2016](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad0525), etc). \n\nNow, there are a lot of details here and while we have some constraints (e.g., the variety of geochemical and isotopic details mentioned above, observations of the masses and angular moments of the Earth-Moon system, etc), the outcomes of the types of models used to simulate this are sensitive to a variety of details. For example, there is the suggestion that significant amounts of the impactor + proto-Earth could have been ejected from the Earth-Moon system and ended up elsewhere in the solar system (e.g., [Jackson & Wyatt, 2012](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/425/1/657/1002593)). Similarly, depending on the properties and ratios of proto-Earth to impactor, different models can reproduce some (if not all) of the details of the canonical view. E.g., [Wade and Wood, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X16300784) suggest a slightly larger impactor with reduced material is required to reproduce all of the geochemical details. In contrast, [Nakajima & Stevenson, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X15003805) simulate a few different scenarios, including the impact of an impactor about the same mass as the proto-Earth (which they ultimately reject as it produces too much mixing of the mantle to honor some geochemical observations which suggest that there must remain a primordial, unmixed portion of the Earth's mantle).",

            "It really isn't though. The only large liquid layer is the outer core, which is ~15% of the total volume of the Earth. The inner core, mantle, and crust (i.e., the remaining 85%) are all solid.",

The point of this subreddit is to educate people, hence my original response, i.e., an attempt to not perpetuate that misconception.",
            "I was sort of thinking about the earth back then but even now if the earth had a big impact it would act more like a big molten ball than a rigid one.  \nLike if the earth was shattered right now would it act like a billiard ball hit by a bullet or would it act like a bag of honey hit by a baseball bat?  \n  \nI'm enjoying these analogies btw!",
