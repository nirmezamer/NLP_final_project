While I disagree with a few things he says, his thinking is clear and organized, and the case he builds is both compelling and fun AF to watch. He's just a great presenter.\n\nWhat a tremendous benefit to the community, to have a philosopher thinking and speaking openly about the process of investigation and discovery.",

            "There was this post about an ama on 4chan and one of the responses mentioned how when the crashed UFOs are recovered they used to find manned ones but more recently they find AI driven ones. I have a few questions but can't find the post anymore ( it was suggested but now its missing... aliens! \ud83d\ude32)\n1. The person stated the deep sea carrier technology was far more advanced than our. So why are we able to recover anything from a crash site? Shouldn't these things be moving at such high speeds that all evidence of what they are is destroyed?\n2. Why would a society that has been capable of fight for millennia only recently come up with using machines to man their aircraft, basically around the same time that humans did this?\n3. They sent planes and a sub to the Bermuda triangle - they claim the plane crashed but the sub returned. But they also claim that all electronics get fucked when approaching. Why didn't the sub get lost as well? I'd expect it to shut down and either all oxygen gets used up or it sinks",

            "1. grusch & others have talked abt the possibility that crashes might be intentional. like this video said: if NHI are actually not human, it is na\u00efve to assume any of the motives WE might assume for \u201ccrashes\u201d might apply. Moreover, the same post from 4chan said crafts were built to spec, for specific purposes - so once said purpose is complete, it seems as if they are indifferent as to what happens to it. \n\nit is a bit unfair to apply human reasoning to intrinsically non-human things. \n\n2. this assumes way too much about NHI having motivations similar to humans. for all we know, \u201cthey\u201d could have 300 different categories of missions, with 300 different kinds of piloting material based on different protocols. moreover, the 4chan guy was talking about a UAP base in the Bermuda triangle, and repeatedly said he didn\u2019t know if there were more\u2026. very possible there are many (dozens?) of other bases with other kinds of UAPs / ships / etc at their disposal. \n\n3. i mean, if that\u2019s your complaint with his post, go for it\u2026 we have no idea from the extremely scant details how said operation was planned, how it unfolded, etc. perhaps something underwater would have better chances than planes? perhaps the radius for what \u201cmesses up electronics\u201d is subject to other variables we don\u2019t understand? valid complaint ig but it wasn\u2019t a crucial part of his argument.",
            "Guy is a philosopher professor, his audience are philosophy students.  He's not trying not to get deep into the weeds - be it anatomy, genetics, morphology -  just simply that extraordinary conclusions require extraordinary proof and the 'best' Nazca mummies present something both exceptionally strange and exceptionally difficult to explain in conventional terms.  \n  \n  \nHis point wasn't to replicate DIY Stan Winston's creature shop (granted: the sorts of people who could give a proper University-level discussion on how to construct such a thing) but to suggest that even a 'practical effects' type doll would require a level of extortionary effort to pass thru an extremely sensitive machine like a CRT that would easily spot bits of glue, sawed bone etc.\n\n  \nFrankly - I do agree the doll stuff could be presented a bit better - and in fairness I think it's why he saves some of his strongest ammo til the end with the Nazca/Paracas lines and the Japanese Jomon Pottery.",

            "It wasn't that it wasn't presented well enough, it could have been explained in a few slides. And there have been some x rays that were highly suspicious of the hands from what I remember. The older they were in terms of being \"discovered\" the more it looked like someone was constructing the hands. That's what I remember but that's a totally different discussion. \n\nNobody in that room seemed excited at that point, they all got real quiet and were probably thinking the same thing I was. It is obvious that hoaxing a body that can be CT scanned and researched isn't easy. He didn't need to show that with little toys.",
            "How? Most people I hear say \u201cthink critically\u201d are just using that as a catch al defense. I\u2019m not saying the information in this video is right or wrong just that I hate that phrase. It\u2019s used all the time when people have no real argument and say \u201cyou just need to think critically man\u201d because saying that automatically means you have a huge brain that the other person couldn\u2019t possibly comprehend. It\u2019s a baseless lazy argument.",
            "sure, it can be a \"conversation stoppers\" or \"thought-terminating clich\u00e9.\" i think those are the terms you're looking for. but obviously titling a philosophy lecture like this is appropriate and its over an hour long so it's not just \"google it man\"",

Like when they scanned from bottom to top you can see individual fingers moving around very smoothly, if you play with the brightness you can see it has an eye that is a lot smaller than the larger Shadow you see. \n\nOne of the few videos of another species that has yet to be disproven, this could very well be a genuine video of an alien species right in front of our face.\n\nTo get more Comfort we would require some official source to back this video up of course.

I truly do not understand how this has held on for so long with the UFO community because it is just so obviously on its face fake.

Multiple witnesses reported that the creatures seemed to be in extreme distress, even the children witnesses could sense it.\n\nThe doctor also said that at first, he thought the creature was a common underground dwelling species of animal.

It would seem that the cranium weight is intrinsically too much for the neck to  support and it bulges and recesses with the effort. This might be seen as evidence of genetic manipulation.

This is a sign of bad texture mapping with not so great rigging of the skin. You can see this blink on the video at the 33-34 second mark. It's so evident. It means they drew the shadow of the eyelid, and it's getting stretched with the blink animation. \n\nYou also can't say aliens, it's alien. Their brows shouldn't be moving along with the blink, regardless. \n\nThe suits are described as being skin tight for all abductees and even government documents. This creature's suit isn't. Their arms aren't that chunky either. I know this because I saw ones forearm. They are not thick. \n\nPlus, the reason why they slowed it down, is because it looks so computer generated if they run it at a normal speed. Put the video to 1.5+ speed, and you'll see how generated it is. \n\nThe shoulder when he lifts his arm, drops down the moment his arm lifts, and it's pushed forward.

Why would we expect aliens to blink? \n\nVictor described the medical care of these beings as \"a dog and pony show\" since they inevitably die and there is virtually nothing that can be done.

It could also be decades old which would further preclude advanced medical or forensic tech.\n\nFurthermore, if UAP events are treated primarily as perceived threats from foreign adversaries as the Pentagon tries to emphasize, it would not be a stretch to imagine US military doctors treating the subject roughly/awkwardly if they considered it to be a potential enemy combatant.\n\nYou seem to be taking more of a denialist approach than a skeptical one here. It is at least clear you are using denialist tactics by outright asserting what it is (puppet), and using circumstantial evidence (not seeing advanced medical equipment), as a stand in for any actual substantive evidence. \n\nOn the other hand, I would suggest that additional footage and now physical remains of more specimens matching the exact description would further support the claims that these entities are real and observed elsewhere. The fact that these observations have been repeated doesn\u2019t seem to factor in to your analysis at all. \n\nIf this is fake, wouldn\u2019t they consider the exact elements you are describing to make it seem believable? What benefit is there to making fake footage that also clearly looks fake? I suppose I don\u2019t see a viable motive that aligns with your opinions on this video.\n\nEdit: corrected verb tense",

Our brains automatically abstract images that we try to picture and draw. Some even consider stylistic abstraction as a superior form of art. Egypt for instance when through phases with stylization. \n\nPoint being, it is far more likely this is a very skilled craftsman\u2019s stylistic interpretation of himself or other humans than that of an alien. Despite the sub I\u2019m on I think if there are no other carving to represent humans on site then it is likely representing a human.

Theologically speaking they do represent the stories of ancient gods and many creation stories. This is most likely false narrations made by these beings who understood that the easiest way to manipulate man is to weaponize their belief system. Prove to them that they are gods so they will willingly sacrifice and give themselves to us. \n\nI think it goes much deeper with the fact that we have to most likely destroy any belief structures we have about religion because they were most likely created and utilized against the ancient population long ago to create a long established psychological operation. I mean even if you look at the Sumerian translations it says right in their story that the gods' say before cataclysm 'God will surely punish us for what we have done' \n\nThe stories remain the same, the phenomena is identical to what it was in ancient times with limited interactions as it messes up the project/experiment. This is also demonstrated with the ancient past as too much interaction can be a bad thing . I would better describe us as  they probably look at us like cattle. \n\nThis is the nitty gritty side of disclosure. The original appearance of these advanced intelligences were most likely out of manipulation and using us.\n\n But yin and yang with bad there has to be some good.",

The structure  looks pitiful. Like bare minimum planning. The concrete walkway covers the entire inner wall all the way around so you could only even see the columns in the middle really. It just looks bad.

Perhaps they were a little too involved and they realized that it really ontologically messes with the natural progression of society. This is an observable situation their hand in our world is most likely for their own benefit. Perhaps this is why the sacrifice stories reach across the globe. What's the easiest way to control the population around you especially if you are a highly advanced civilization and need to use the walking incubators around you?  obviously weaponize religion to your advantage because what person would say no to their God? In fact they made the ideas of sacrifices seem Noble and honorable. Very mischievous if you ask me. \n\nI don't think they ever 'lived with us' In fact it probably is exactly how we see it today.
