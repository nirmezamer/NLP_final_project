            "Any word/hint on when the results of the voting event for MH themes will be revealed?",
            "**MHW**\n\nThere's a very specific question that's been nagging at me and I can't find the answer anywhere in the various old threads and forums. Is there a real-world equivalent to the top used for the female Thermae layered armor? And if so, what's it called?",
            "hello! I was checking robomeche's mhw database looking at the data for breakable/severable parts, when i noticed an oddity: \n\nbase game deviljho doesnt have any data at all in the wound column, just the tail is listed a severable, while the in game picture shows both the head and the chest as breakable. On savage jho's database page the numbers seem to be listed correctly (altho it also lists the body as a separate breakable part that the in game picture doesnt list).  Does anyone know what's going on here ,and if it's possible to contact the creator of the database to fix this? \n\n\n\nIve also noticed a similar thing going on with base diablos and black diablos' pages (one lists the wings as breakable ,the other doesnt ,the in game picture doesn't show it on either one )",
            "Do you think it'll be possible for Capcom to implement a feature in Wilds to let us import our World's character customization file? Just the looks from character creation, like hair, body, face",
            "I skipped over Rise because I couldnt get use to playing it on the Switch when I tried the demo. After seeing the Wilds showcases, and now that Rise is on PC, Im curious are drop rates for jewels any better? It might be my bad luck, I remember grueling and farming for hours, and breaking parts only to turn up with nothing, or not enough because of how low drop rates were for stuff like that. Im wondering if they improved since, or if its around the same. Its not going to stop me from trying Rise now that its on PC, Im just curious.",
            "How is it that the crafty Monster Hunters still haven't developed a backpack/ carry contraption for large fragile items like large eggs so the Hunters don't have to carry them with both their arms and can move more freely.",
            "Starting Sunbreak after MH Rise Base Game completed when it got released. What exactly got added into the base game and changes in sunbreak and what got nerfed an buffed? is there an overview?",
            "I last played world at launch and feeling a new one - Rise comes to PS+ soon, but Iceborne is only 40 CAD (which is negated by getting Sunbreak eventuallt) - what\u2019s the differences between the two and which one should I go with?",
            "What's the general progression of quests to do after beating the Iceborne Story?\n\nLike do I do event quests, do I just grind grinding lands and stuff like that.\n\nI'm not looking for the weapon progressions cuz that's already a thing on the discord server but the general progression of the game.\n\nThx in advance",
            "I remember at launch Monster Hunter World was difficult to play with friends, you had to play story missions up till the point where you saw the monsters cutscene, then back out of the mission and restart it over(or something like that), did that ever get fixed? Looking to get back into World with a buddy until Wilds comes out but I'm not looking to jump through hoops just to play with him, it'd also be his first MH experience so I don't want to soil it with weird QoL.",
            "MHWI\n\nExcuse my french, but what in the BEANS is Guiding Lands Tempered Lunastra?! Scratch that, what in the seven beans is Lunastra to begin with? I haven't felt this frustrated with a monster since I had to fight Raging Brachydios. I'm rockin over 35 fire resistance, fire mantle, and 980 armour and I still get hit with Phat chunks of damage. But most of all, what do you even do against her Nova? I'm trying to be as aggressive as I possibly can, I'm bad but doing my best, and yet I can never stop or predict her nova. Honestly I want to type a 200 page essay talking mad smack about this dumb as dirt monster but yeah, I just wanna know what the heck you're supposed to do against it.\n\nEDIT: Fixed typo(s)",
            "MHRS\n\nIs coalescence useful? Like, 4 elemental points at level 3 wtf is this?",
            "should I play MH Rise before MHW? technically Rise is an newer game so it should have more modern stuff that makes the game play better but Rise takes less space on my PC so...",
            "In MHR I've been playing the game for a minute now I'm at HR96 and the game feels awful? Like the only fights I really enjoyed are Narwa/Ibushi and the fire spitting spider\n\n\nEverything else feels like a chore to get through \nAm I playing this wrong? Also is there like no was to spend like the power ups from LS anymore? Like the Helmsplitter in MHW",
            "Playing MHRise. Just a quick ~~dumb~~ question. Can i save different weapon augments per equipment load out?\n\nI use elemental builds for dual blades. \n\nExample is I want to put more sharpness boost on my magma slicers when i battle a barroth vs more elemental boost when i battle an arzuros. \n\nIs this possible? Thank you!",
            "Is monster hunter wings of ruin worth it on the switch for a player who has never played MH but loves pokemon? Can you nickname your monster? Is the world open like zelda botw or more like a pokemon platform? I like easy games without much challenge, would this be the game for me?\u00a0",
            "Is it possible to beat Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak using only one weapon like Only Greatsword, longsword or even a HBG/LBG?",
            "When are you suppose to attack?",
            "Best MH for newcomers? I'm interested in the main franchise and i have a Switch, PS3, Wii, Wii U, Xbox Series S",
            "Hi i play this game for one or  two weeks after release im using GPS joystick to play the game. but since update spoofing won't work anymore.   I want to play this game again and grind is Spoofing available now in androird device?",
            "the closest i was able to find is Chasuble tunic (or further apron), but in short?",
            "Maybe, though it would likely depend on if they're using the same character creator, which they may not. Assuming you have a character edit voucher available, you can always just go to the character edit screen, screenshot your sliders, and then hope those will have parallels in Wilds.",
            ">and now that Rise is on PC\n\njfyi: has been on PC since 7(?) months after Switch release\n\ndecos are craftable, charms are RNG\n\ne: realized OP likely meant the rare parts (plate/gem/mantle)\n\nfor that its as the other comment said +its not been changed and thats what MH is about (world AND rise and all others)",
            "Drop rates are the same across platforms and haven't changed.\n\nIn Sunbreak, some endgame materials can be purchased once you have hunted the associated monster enough times, even if you never got that material as a drop.",
            "How would you reach your weapon if a Rathian is attacking you?\n\nAlso supposedly the Seikret can either be ridden when carrying eggs or will carry them for you in Wilds so the 100% objectively true answer is \"They didn't have someone strong enough to pawn it off to\".",
            "Because it wouldn't be nearly as funny if the hunter had a sensible way to carry eggs.",
            "the sunbreak release patchnotes on capcoms SB homepage contain a list for nerfs/buffs (not with exact numerical values though)\n\nRise didnt get anything added with SB (still affected by buffs/nerfs obv) other than your palamute getting the \"sniff em out\" ability to find items to gather aroudn the map when you own SB",
            "The base game got the Defender weapon trees and the Black Belt and Black Belt S armor sets, for players who want to rush through the base game to get to Sunbreak.",
            "*Most* of the changes happened on Sunbreak's release, which has an official changelog [on Capcom's website](https://www.monsterhunter.com/rise-sunbreak/update/en-uk/ver10_00_02.html).\n\nThere aren't any numbers for how strong the buffs are, but most weapons got buffed across the board (especially Lance!). These buffs are available for all players, not just those who own *Sunbreak.*\n\nOther than buffs/nerfs though, there aren't many changes to the basegame, outside of the Defender/Black Belt gear.",
            "Iceborne is the expansion to World so it offers more expanded gameplay from World is\n\nSunbreak is the expansion to Rise so it offers more expanded gameplay from Rise\n\nWorld has nothing to do with SB and IB has nothing to do with Rise\n\nrule 11 link/searchbar for more info/comparison between them",
            "do whatever you are able to do (personal skill/build wise)\n\nyou can go by title update releases\n\nor grind MR to 100/guiding lands regions up to access augments asap and fight the base iceborne challenging monsters before the others",
            "Honestly, I'd just hop into the Guiding Lands while also doing other content in release order. That way you'd get a steady increase of difficulty and power, while not having some unlocks completely overpower everything else.\n\n(Though you can skip the Arch-Tempered stuff if you want, as that's a super high difficulty specifically designed to cater to the highest tier of players)",
            "That is still a thing in World.\n\nBasically both would go into a quest, try to see the cutscene, one backs out and joins the other.",
            "it's still present in World bc, going by capcom, its not something to \"fix\" (its a thing in Wilds again, although they claim its better/more fluent there)\n\npost IB non-story missions with cutscenes can be watched together though (dont ask me why\n\n\n\nRise does not have this issue btw, the cutscenes play for everyone at the start and can be vote-skipped\n\n\n\nit's honestly not too in World bad, just the story missions and most of the game is grinding. just sprinkle more non-story missions inbetween and it should be okay if you give them a heads up\n\nonly one of you has to back out after the cutscene and then they can join the other\n\n(PC has skip cutscene mod but still requires you to watch them all)",
            "One thing that helps against Lunastra a great deal is Windproof. Her Hellflare is a lot more manageable when you aren't stunlocked by wind pressure, and she also uses a lot of wind pressure moves outside of that when she's scattering her puddles around and whatnot.\n\nWatermoss can remove the puddles (but not the flames). Weapons with water element also work, but Luna's elemental weakness is ice, not water, so you probably don't want to bring a water weapon. Heat Guard ignores the flames (but not the puddles).\n\nI strongly recommend using a hammer or horn, because her head is _not_ a weakpoint for edged damage, only blunt (the wings and, to a lesser extent, tail are the good hitzones for edged damage). Since she's an elder dragon you want to be hitting her in the head as much as possible to make her fall down and knock her aura down a step.\n\nShe's the only elder dragon whose \"leveling up my aura\" move isn't basically instantaneous. The others just roar and power up (except Kirin, who strikes himself with lightning), but Luna has to go into a charging-up posture in which she's just standing still for several seconds. If you're lucky, you can stagger or topple her before she finishes.",
            "1. no ATs in guiding lands, that's \"just\" tempered (i'm so glad AT luna is in HR only). you only need her mats for very few things (if any but layered stuff)\n\n2. how to fight: you dont, you tank the dmg and lifesteal back or fail. she's a major bitch and totally not fun to fight (i saw a lance player poke lifstealing vs the nova but idk how/what healing power went into that build)\n\n3. nova: cant be prevented. she WILL do it (unless you somehow prevent her from EVER charging even once, the one sparks that make her hair glow, afaik impossible unless modding).\n\nBUT you can trigger it early by flashing her so do that when you're in a safe distance (something like border to the next area)",
            "It's good to remember that for most end-game weapons in Rise/Sunbreak, you will find that they have about 30-50 elemental points on the weapon at most. Four extra points sounds lame on paper, but if you reword it as \"\\~10% increase\" it sounds a lot more useful. It's all about context.\n\nCoalescence also gives a good amount of straight attack, which is always good.",
            "One level for 12 raw is good. Level 2 and 3 aren't worth it.\n\nEdit: only use it with skills that inflict debuff on yourself like bloodlust and hellfire cloak, and ideally on a weapon with an armour move like CB air dash to take debuff from a monster intentionally.",
            "they both have almost the same modernization/QoL stuff compared to previous MHs and the stuff thats different is non-factor (imo) like Rise has a loadout menu for gear and layered (transmog) separately and together, so you're \"More in control\" while World has one loadout menu that goes \"save loadout (gear)\">\"save loadout (costume)\"\n\nfor actual differences that might make you (not) play one or the other see rule 11 link but if you're just worried about the order it really doesnt matter",
            "Helmsplitter is part of the silkbind Soaring Kick in Rise. If you hit the monster with the initial jump, you can press the right trigger to initiate a helmsplitter. If you do not press anything, you'll instead do a weaker plunging thrust.\n\nTbh, I think that base game Rise has a better roster than World overall.",
            "You'd probably get more out of it if you were already a Monster Hunter fan, but I don't see why someone unfamiliar with the franchise wouldn't enjoy it. I stopped playing Pokemon after Gen IV but I enjoyed Stories 2. You can nickname your monsties, except for the \"main\" one, but I think once you beat the game you can take that one out of your team. It's been a bit since I played but I seem to recall the world is more Pokemon-style in that you've got separate (albeit pretty large) maps rather that one full seamless one. As for ease, eh. It's not going to be a complete cakewalk. If the demo is still on the Switch, I'd recommend trying that out. If you end up liking it, demo progress should transfer to the full game.",
            "Why wouldn't it?",
            "yeah just like in any other MH game (afaik even frontier)\n\nthough some weapons are better matches for different monsters theres nothing that is really hard to beat by not using X",
            "In general? That little window after a monster has attacked and is doing nothing/turning itself to face you again.\n\nWhen you're skilled? As soon as you're sure the attack will not hit you and until the next attack needs avoided.",
            "When you're not going to get hit. Monsters win trades 99% of the time. Either wait your turn (watch for when the monster is finished attacking and goes back to idle) or sneak hits in while the monster is attacking (learn both your and the monster's movesets so you know where it's safe to punish).\n\nFor example, think about Rathian's triple fireball attack. You can either wait until all three fireballs are finished then move in to counterattack, or you can position yourself in such a way that you can attack while she's shooting fireballs that aren't going to hit you.",
            "Usually for large monsters, you want to attack in between their attacks. Outside of that, you just have to memorize the attack patterns of monster, and after your first few hunts, it'll come naturally.",
            "You can just jump right in. Playing past games are fun but the new ones are a bit easier and just as fun. I'd start with World because it has the best graphics, good tutorial and is technically the 5th main line game.\n\nMonster Hunter Generations is on the Switch and it plays like the previous games pre-world. Has all the monsters in the series before World updated the engine. It's a lot clunkier but many players fell in love with these older games. Monster Hunter Rise is the latest game on Switch and PC and it's really fun.",
            "rule 11 link/searchbar in general is great at finding answers to such (likely common) questions",
            "mobile looks like this group is not for MNH sorry :D",
            "Ah okay. Thanks.\n\nThats at least good to know.",
            "You're saying my Palico is strong enough to hunt monsters alongside me, but not strong enough to hold an egg?\n\n... Actually, I'm not sure I'd trust an AI companion with something so fragile.",
            "Ah, yeah my bad, was so tilted from fighting her and fainting 4 or 5 times that I didn't even notice I said arch tempered lol. But yeah, I am fashion hunting right now and getting all layered sets one at a time but I am grateful to the gods who slumber beyond the stars that I don't have to fight this frustration made personified for anything other than fashion.. for now. Thanks for the tips/info. I have a very basic life steal lance build but I guess I'll have to improve it.",
            "Coalescence is definitely not 10% because the up time is tricky and a weapon can be augmented to add up to 53 more element, but that doesn't matter since it's only fair to compare a skill to another skill. Burst takes up the same decoration slots as coalescence, and one level of burst already provides 5 to 8 element. Coalescence does have good straight attack but that's about the only thing good from it.",
            "coolio. i heard they nerfed hunting horn in rise but I guess this gives me a chance to play another weapon for once...",
            "Who cares about monsters when the hitboxes feel super terrible \nYou get hit by stuff that would have never connected in world \nSo helmsplitter got basically put on cooldown then? \nIs there any other attack I can use to spend the red power up for dmg? \nFeels kinda bad how everything seems to be focused on counters...",
            "You're treating it like he can't run both. He asked if it was useful, and with the attack and elemental buff, it is. Are there better options for pure attack or pure element? Yes, but it's still a good staple skill to have as well.\n\nThe 10% was an approximation, hence the \\~tilde. It will obviously change per context, just giving a general perspective of it.",
            "they greatly changed hunting horn from World to Rise yes (idk how it was before World)\n\nbut it's still worth trying out (as are all other weapons)",
            "I wouldn't really say *nerfed,* but rather *replaced it with a different weapon.* Rise Hunting Horn plays **nothing** like World Hunting Horn, even down to the basic attacks.",
            "Hitboxes are not terrible in Rise, in fact, hitbox visualizations show that monster have basically no disjointed hitboxes at all, they are a very close match to their visual model. Some monsters, like Anjanath or Tigrex in World/Iceborne, have way worse hitboxes by comparison.\n\nIn Sunbreak, you can also spend the LS gauge to charge up a powerful attack with Sacred Sheathe.",
            "3rd and 4th gen HH is fairly similar to World HH, but you couldn't stock songs at all, and recitals and encores do not have the extra shockwave hit.\n\nIn 2nd gen, HH's main attacks were completly divorced from playing songs, instead, you had to enter recital mode, and then stand around to let the HH play the note, then press a button to switch stance for a different note, and so on. The attacks the hunter would do when switching stance were later repurposed into the recital animations when the weapon got overhauled in 3rd gen, IIRC. 2nd gen HH is really clunky.",
            "Nah hitboxes are horrible\nThere's a ton of videos showing exactly this \nAnja and tig are literally the same as in world \nTig I'd argue is even worse now",
            "All the issues with Rise's hitboxes can be summed up with one of the following 3 reasons:\n\n1. Getting hit by an anti-wall hitbox. These are deliberately super large and disjointed, in order to give monsters the ability to deal with people wall-running or camping on cliffs to snipe the monster with bowguns. However, even though those send you flying, they actually deal no damage.\n2. Anti-air hitboxes. These hitboxes can only hurt you if you are airborne. Some moves cause the monster's entire body to be covered by those hitboxes, so even though when you are grounded, you do not get hit by the move at all, if you try to jump/use a wiredash, you get hit and take damage. For most people, it is very unintuitive that moves exist that can only hurt you if you are in a certain state, but the hitboxes themselves do not extend past the monster's body.\n3. The hunter's hurtbox. This works in tandem with the aerial hitboxes. Even though the hunter may do flips midair with various animations, the actual hitbox of the hunter stays upright. This can cause weird issues where you can get hit without the monster visually touching you, this is the most prevalent cause of seemingly BS hitboxes.\n\nThe hitboxes themselves are placed reasonably on the vast majority of monsters.\n\nAs for Tigrex and Anjanath, I'm pointing those two out in particular because they have some really questionable hitboxes in World, and you cannot use any of the aforementioned reasonings to explain those. For Tigrex, its charge for no apparent reason has a gigantic hitbox beneath its arm at the beginning of the animation in Iceborne, so it can hit hunters even though it visually went above them, while Anjanath in general seems to just have mis-sized hitboxes, which causes stuff like its bite extending a bit past its snout, or the little kicks to the side hitting you even though you are standing well clear of them. These sorts of things do not happen in Rise, if Tigrex sails over your hunter at the start of the charge, it will miss you, etc."
