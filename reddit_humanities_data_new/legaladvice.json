        "content": "Florida. We ordered the glasses for about $300 after my wife lost hers. We used insurance but it was still expensive. Her prescription is -7 and -5.75. Boils down to basically very bad. She can\u2019t drive without her glasses and has had to rely on uber and myself to take her anywhere for over 2 months. The optometrist said \u201cno more than 2 weeks\u201d but it\u2019s obviously passed that. They say the lenses keep breaking at their lab but isn\u2019t there some expectation that our contract in my paying them mean they should be delivering something?\n\nWe finally caved and bought cheap contacts online just so she could see anything but we\u2019re still out $300 and our insurance won\u2019t cover a new pair for another year. \n\nHow can I help her see again? Ultimately I\u2019d rather have the glasses over the money just due to the time constraints. ",

            "Call your insurance provider and let them know the issue.",
            "NAL, but I worked in an optical shop and lab. The likely answer is that the frame your wife picked out is not compatible with her prescription/and or the type of lens she bought. This can cause breakage issues and not all prescriptions were meant to be put in any frame. There are actually frames that have a restriction on what prescription can be put in it. Without more information on the size of the frame and the type of lens purchased(plastic, polycarbonate or high index) it\u2019s hard for me to advise on that, but it can totally be a case of the sales associate (even in an optometrist office) not knowing the nuances of that. Even though glasses are \u201ccustom\u201d they can be returned and exchanged. I would recommend going back to the optometrist office and asking them if the frame/lens selection is not compatible with each other and if there is a more senior associate who can recommend the correct combination that will work with your wife\u2019s prescription and lens selection.",
            "Ask for a refund. I work in an optical and that is simply unacceptable. We definitely have lenses that break/chip/Crack depending on the material used but even for specialty lenses, it only takes 4 weeks.",
            "Go ahead and call insurance to advise of the issue-they might be able to get a refund. If you have the actual prescription (legally they have to give it to you) you can order glasses for much much cheaper online. Sites like zeelool or glasses shop have a ton of selection and lenses. I'm personally -7.75 and -5.75 with astigmatism, and they make great glasses that I pay about $80 for. \n\nAlso, for contact lenses, mine run about $100 each for a 3 month supply. I go to 1800contacts and get the acuvue oasis lenses. That site WILL need your doc to confirm the prescription, versus the glasses sites.",
            "At that point just take her to small claims court and get your money back or force her to pay for your glasses/lenses at a different provider. 2 months is ridiculous.",

            "We\u2019ve had the issue before so we get the high index lenses with all the shaving they offer and big frames.",
            "Just calling the insurance that paid for those glasses that were never delivered should light a fire under them very fast.",
            "But first just ask for the money back and talk to insurance about getting the yearly credit back.\n\nAlthough, in my experience, insurance does not help much with the cost, which OP might not realize if he's never done the comparison. It's certainly cheaper to go through an online store without insurance than to go through a traditional eyeglass store with insurance.",
            "With the high RX they can end up being a little closer to $80 in my experience but still not $300. Have had good luck with my high RX using zenni and eyebuydirect as well.",
            "At that strength, she needs the highest index lenses which cost an extra $50. Anything extra like transition lenses would be another $50 or so. It's easily $75-$150, but definitely worth it to have one or more backup pairs. (My mind is blown that she didn't already have a previous prescription lying around when her vision is that bad.)",

            "I had similar eyesight prior to my cataract / lasik surgeries. I once went to Lenscrafter and let them know of my prescription ahead of picking frames and they told me \"We can make it work with ANY frame in our store.\" \n\nChallenge accepted. I found ones I really liked. \n\nThey technically DID make it fit, but it was like a coke bottle in a thong for either eye.",
            "That\u2019s not true at all. You can put high prescriptions in wire frames but more of the lens thickness will show.   I\u2019ve been in the optical industry for over 25 years and I\u2019ve seen many, many prescriptions at this strength and have definitely put them in metal frames.  I even had a patient with a slightly higher rx get a drilled rimless.   It might not look as aesthetically pleasing but it works.",
            "I'm the same as your husband and have been told the same.",
            "High index lenses, while thinner than polycarbonate, are actually made from a hybrid plastic material and therefore more prone to \u201cbreakage\u201d and chipping when they are being mounted in the frame. This happens a lot with thicker frames, as in the width of the plastic itself, especially in frames with plastic nosepieces that are attached. I would recommend choosing a thinner plastic frame preferably with nosepieces that stick out on \u201clittle legs\u201d vs the ones that are one piece with the frame.\n\nIn all honesty, optical shops are treated a lot more like retail than a medical office, so even if the shop you went to was attached to a doctors office, I bet the training the sales person got was not in any way a technical one. Sales associates in optical stores are encouraged to sell high index lenses to anyone with prescription above -3.5 because \u201cthey are thinner\u201d and the most expensive type. They don\u2019t take the actual technical lab process of making the glasses into account when pairing lenses with frames because they are not really trained on that. I would ask if they have a certified optician and speak directly to them about the lens and frame selection.",
            "For an extreme prescription, you want small frames.  To produce the required magnification, the lens gets thinner from the edge to the center.  If the frames are large the required difference in thickness gets larger and you end up with a very thin and fragile center.",

            "With a high RX, you can still use cheap mid-index lenses, they look like awful but if you're getting spares (or prescription readers for occasional use) the sub-$40 options are fine.",

            "Zenni can make prisms, but the problem with them and any other online order site is that it\u2019s best to get an accurate measurement of where your pupils line up in the glasses lens and that takes using a brick and mortar place. I\u2019ve tried it before with Zenni and they\u2019re not as comfortable. But you can buy frames from Zenni and then only buy lenses from the store.",

            "I can\u2019t really imagine an optometrist or lab telling a customer the reason for the delay in their order is lenses breaking. Maybe OP just heard breakage and assumed a broken lens. But even telling the customer the issue is breakage is weird. The most I would say is the lens or lenses didn\u2019t pass inspection.",
            "My prescription is -2.75 on one eye. The other eye changes a lot with time. It's been +0.75 to -1.5 over the years. (Currently I have no prescription in that lense)",

            "What I meant was - the rx was wacky. The op posted originally-7 on one side and +6 on the other. Unless I read wrong the first. Time. Yeah if that were the rx- that would be wacky.",
            "I have serious astigmatism as well as other issues. Grinding the lens to satisfy both the intense astigmatism and the distance correction results in lots of breakage during manufacture. Some years back, the optometrist called to say the lab agreed to make three attempts a day, but then they would need to move to other orders and they\u2019d try again the next day. Took about four weeks, even with the high index lens material.\n\nI brought my last prescription to Costco. They handed it back saying my prescription exceeded the specifications of their lens making equipment.",
            "Hey at least they were honest!  I\u2019d love to see the lab\u2019s reaction when they finally nailed yours. OP\u2019s optometrist needs to tell them they can\u2019t do it and refund."

            "Thanks for the advice, they are all good points.   \nI hate to put wire up cause it would look like crap and could injure my dogs. What if I could get video of them letting the kid reaching thru? I have a portable door cam and a still game cam. So far my dogs haven't done anything even with the kid reaching, but it worries me that the Dad was goading the kid to reach thru the fence. I get along with his Mom but I just don't trust the kids 'dad'. Amazon delivered a package to their house by mistake (saw their porch in Amazons delivery pic), walked over and knocked on the door and saw him looking right at me on the stairs in the house but wouldn't answer. When Mom got home I showed her the pic and asked her to ask him, she came back out and said he knew nothing about it. I lied and said I'd have to call the cops and make a report to get a refund. 5mins later she my was at my door with my case of V-8 juice.   \n  Just thinking if I planted the seed of me having a record of him letting the kid reach he might not be tempted to test my insurance. Or I'm just being paranoid, like I say neither work and she looks to be 15, used to catch her climbing in his window when I'd let the dogs out at night.",

            "The dogs have only nipped and never drew blood, and only twice in 10 years. Both times the victim was teasing them or trying to pick them up. And I beg to differ on the liability, if they are not invited or expected on your fenced property and enter then it's at their own risk. Not sure how that applies to a baby reaching thru a picket fence. Oh and to top it off they put an above ground pool up with no fence, and the daughter practices archery in the backyard using their other neighbors fence as a backdrop.\n\nI'll go over and have a friendly chat with the Mom just to let her know my concerns and see what she says. The only time we've sort of had words is when they chained a puppy to the A/C unit in 90\u00b0 heat. Told her to bring the dog inside or I was calling the cops. She said it kept pooping inside and pissing her (now ex) husband off. Never saw the dog again, she later said they 'returned' it.",

I am confused as well, I don\u2019t understand why he went through a lengthy court battle just to cut her out of his life. \n\nWe went through a year long custody fight. Child interviews, drug testing over false allegations, DCS case opened, reunification for my daughter and her father. All of it.\n\n\nWe just got our judgement in the mail a couple weeks back and we both have joint legal decision making but he was not awarded any overnights and only 2 afternoons a week for about 3 hours each and 6 hours on Saturdays. \n\nHe had the possibility of overnights in the future if he did at least one therapy session a month with her for 3 months and then filed again with the court and progress had been made. \n\n\nAll of this made him extremely angry, I guess. He stopped answering texts and picking her up. Yesterday after I sent a text asking if he was going to pick her up 15 minutes after the time he was supposed to he sent my daughter and myself a group text saying that he is cutting contact with us, he is no longer doing visitation and the relationship is over unless my daughter goes to the court and says she lied about him ever abusing her and that she is abusing him and he can\u2019t have that in his life. If we want to contact him we need to reach him through email only from now on. \n\nI am assuming our numbers are blocked. He has done that before. My daughter is only 13. \n\n\nMy question is how long do I wait to file for sole legal decision making? We just finished court so it seems awfully premature to go back but, he also said he wants nothing to do with her anymore and told both of us not to contact him so I can\u2019t really co parent with someone that is doing this.

Right now he could reasonably tell the judge that he had an ill-considered but temporary burst of frustration and that yes, your honor, he definitely does want to take advantage of his parenting time going forward , and he would likely get another chance. It would just cost you $$ and time. \n\nI would probably give it at least a few weeks with you reaching out on schedule through whatever documentable channels you have (email, parenting app, whatever) to confirm whether he is planning on utilizing his time.  If he continues to say no (or tells you to chuck off again) you can take it back to court.  Even if he does, you\u2019d probably look better to the court if you continue to make your kid available on the predetermined schedule (I.e, don\u2019t plan conflicting activities).",

            "Yes, it\u2019s called that here too. My ex tried to file one in the middle of our case and the judge wasn\u2019t happy about it at all and in turn limited his parenting time even more. \n\nI really just wanted to know if I should go back sooner or later because he said he is cutting contact and wants nothing to do with her.

            "That is bad advice. Filing for emergency hearings require an *actual* emergency situation. This is not an emergency. Thousands if not hundreds of thousands of parents don't exercise their visitation every single day in the US. Filing for an emergency hearing would be a waste of time and money on your end because it will almost assuredly be denied. \n\nIf he goes no contact with you, that's on him. If you have to do some kind of scheduled drop off pursuant to the order you got, you need to attempt to do that for a few drop offs until it's evident he isn't going to show up. You don't have to stay for hours but 15 minutes after the time he's supposed to show and doesn't contact you about it you can reasonably leave. \n\nIt will take a while for him to fail to exercise his visitation before the court will even entertain modifying the visitation order. He has bare minimum visitation right now. It really doesn't affect you all that much for him to not exercise it at the moment. Asking the court to remove it altogether is a huge ask for the court to do. As far as the legal decision making, that won't affect most of your day-to-day things for a 13 year old. It might become an issue if you need to get a passport or start having to fill out FAFSA. Asking the court to remove that portion of the order is an easier sale after a while of him not exercising visitation and not contacting you than asking them to remove his visitation schedule.",

            "This is what Arizona law says about the timing of a motion to modify:\n\n>A person shall not make a motion to modify a legal decision-making or parenting time decree earlier than one year after its date, unless the court permits it to be made on the basis of affidavits that there is reason to believe the child's present environment may seriously endanger the child's physical, mental, moral or emotional health. At any time after a joint legal decision-making order is entered, a parent may petition the court for modification of the order on the basis of evidence that domestic violence involving a violation of section 13-1201 or 13-1204, spousal abuse or child abuse occurred since the entry of the joint legal decision-making order. Six months after a joint legal decision-making order is entered, a parent may petition the court for modification of the order based on the failure of the other parent to comply with the provisions of the order.\n\nSo, whether you're looking at six months or a year would depend on whether your ex is failing to comply with the order. Non-custodial parents are generally not *required* to exercise their parenting time, so his refusal to do that probably doesn't count. Whether he is required to be available for you to contact about legal decisions is a closer question that probably comes down to the specific wording of the order.",

            "Not a lawyer, but I'd suggest including a deadline for response in the emails and/or texts. That way if he tries to claim you made decisions without him in future hearings, you can show that you reached out and gave him a clear timeline for a decision, but you can't reasonably be expected to not decide things or default to no just because he fails to respond within so many days or weeks.   \n  \nMost major decisions have actual deadlines or timelines - you need to apply for a summer camp, or sign a permission slip by a date, or for medical care schedule it in advance or handle things before they get worse. So if you document that you're giving him reasonable notice and he doesn't respond in that window you can use that as specific evidence in the future.",

They left the scene without repairing it and a representative from the city called me and said it is an illegal connection and that I'll need to drill a new well at my own cost.  Here are the relevant details as I understand them:\n\n* I am on a shared artesian well with at least 5 other homes in my neighborhood, maybe more (nobody really seems to know).  The well head is on a different neighbor's property.\n* The well was drilled in 1977 and my home was built in 1981.  All this predates the city's water records.\n* The water pipe supplying my house crosses a city maintained road inside a city owned culvert.  The city is planning to replace this culvert in the near future.\n* My closing/title documents reference plat records in old city record books, but I have not located any specific details about how my home was connected to this well 40+ years ago.\n* A neighbor on the same shared well has a copy of a well access agreement from 1977 that names 5 lots with access to the water.  My lot is not named on this document, but my home had not been built yet.\n\nThe city representative I spoke to said they are reviewing the situation, but that possible outcomes are:\n\n1. They'll cut and cap the water pipe supplying my home when they renovate the culvert, leaving my home without water.\n2. They'll require the remaining homes on the shared well to file new permits or, more likely, require that all owner's drill individual wells also because community wells are no longer allowed.\n\nAny advice about how I can protect myself?  I'm sure I'm at the point that I need to involved a real estate attorney, but what should I be considering?  Is this something that should have been disclosed to me when I purchased the house and I could possibly seek compensation from my title insurance?",

If they're unwilling to fix it because of those code violations, then you could get that monetary compensation. Many times we try to work with everyone to prevent any litigation. \n\nI work for a municipality and the individuals who broke your well and who spoke with you about codes and city ordinances are probably not the same people who handle claims filed against the city. We get claims pretty often by individuals having the property damaged by municipality workers and if we don't do anything about it it can be considered negligence.",

How can they claim you have an unlawful connection if you've been paying them for water this entire time?  How did they think the water was getting to your house?\n\nYour water is running from a well to a city-owned culvert, which I'm assuming means water goes through city owned pipes to reach your house. Since there are no records of your pipe connected to the city owned pipe, I can definitely understand the argument that your connection was unauthorized. \n\nWhy can't you just pay to be authorized to be hooked up to city water? If they are rerouting the water, then I doubt they have an obligation to provide water to a non-recorded connection. I think you have a good argument that the city needs to provide you water immediately and then give you notice that they are going to cut off your water at some date in the future.",

            "From a legal perspective, your BF knew or should have known the meds were incorrect before he ingested them.    This would likely significantly diminish any recovery you MIGHT receive  and potentially eliminate it altogether.",
            "I use to work in a Walgreens pharmacy, and it blows my mind that they could've done something like this, as there are SO many parameters, barriers, and multiple checks before those meds make it to the customer's hands. From each medications having specific manufacturer codes, to having specific colors, shapes, sizes, and numbers for identification purposes, and having the on hand pharmacist checking and verifying the script has been correctly filled out before making them purchasable. Not saying it can't happen, but that's crazy to me.",
            "Unfortunately on top of the issues others have pointed out (that the medication was properly labeled and he failed to notice) I could see the high-priced lawyers you'd be facing arguing that travelers to Mexico can sometimes experience similar symptoms from drinking contaminated water/eating contaminated food (aka traveler's diarrhea). You can still pursue damages, but the legal fees may outweigh the potential recuperated funds. \n\nED is less likely to help, maybe a pain and suffering damage. How long has this persisted after he stopped the medication?",
            "In Mexico? That could have been from the water.",

            "Not a lawyer, but i took a class on the legal aspects of cybersecurity which included a rudimentary introduction to law. I reckon this would fall under failure of the pharmacy to exercise normal care (privity i think) in ensuring they dispensed the correct medication",
            "The water causes ED!???",
            "I am a lawyer but not anyone here's lawyer.  The pharmacy likely failed to exercise due care.  That said, depending on jurisdiction, your recovery im a situation Luke this will be offset by the percentage of liability that you were deemed to have caused to yourself.\n\nHere, a court/jury will likely find that OP's BF bears some of thr blame for failing to read the prescription bottle before taking the pills.  He was in a position to prevent t his injury but failed to exercise normal precaution.",
            "By EDI, do you mean erectile dysfunction? If so I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s always been well known not to drink the water in Mexico - Montezuma\u2019s Revenge.",
            "This would fall under comparative negligence right?",
            "I think you may have read an exclamation point as \"i\"",
            "Yes. Again, depending on the jurisdiction.  Different states have different legal requirements, thresholds, and nomenclature."
