The direct could\u2019ve been planned for the 15th, moved and then locked into the 21st, and then Pyoro got their info once that happened.",

            "It turned out Midori was a guy and not a Japanese woman. People blew up because, despite Midori never capitalizing on this by like flirting or anything, it was \u201ccreepy\u201d and \u201cthat was catfishing.\u201d Because I guess being a Japanese woman on the internet means something sexual. \u201cShe was acting cute though!\u201d\n\n\nThere were other parts of it- Apparently their real alias, MysticDistance, is a leaker whose history is kinda shakey. And apparently while using the Alias Midori, he got his information by going to Japanese bars and, quite literally, stalking Sega headquarters by looking through windows and stuff to try and find things out. They also got their leaks by befriending other leakers, and their alias as Midori enabled them to discuss those leaks without said friends knowing they were revealing them I think, which is deceptive.\n\n\nThere might have been other accusations though, but for some reason most people focused on the Japanese woman thing? Which to me just comes across as too many people admitting they have no self control and that, to them, a woman being Japanese and sounding cute on the internet means they\u2019ve incentivizing people to hit on them. Which I just think is just stupid.\n\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much it. Midori\u2019s track record was still pretty good, but their means of getting information is, while apparently effective, kinda immoral. It does put into question the accuracy of their yet to be confirmed leaks though.\n\n\nEpic Games Store database accidentally leaked FF9 Remake again though so I\u2019ve got what I want lol",

Those are literally just the events that transpired, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. Tom Henderson called one trailer wrong and this sub tried to lynch him, \u201cMidori\u201d lied about an *entire publisher* showing up at the Xbox conference (outside of Life Is Strange) and people were still defending the kawaii leaker \u201cgirl.\u201d\n\nDo not give gaming Twitter so much benefit of the doubt, you will be disappointed every time.",

Parts of this sub are making it sound like they personally murdered someone at Sega to get her (\\*his) information, but imo that's hardly the most egregious thing on the planet when people have been masquerading as \"not a guy\" on the internet since the early 90's to the point of it being an actual punchline to a joke.",

I'm better than that. They're allowed to be cute or communicate how they want without it being a big deal. This isn't even exclusive to Midori, this is just basic online interactions.\n\n\nLike, the people who are mad they were \"preyed on\" have likely never even spoken to Midori, let alone were never friends with them. There was never any obligation.\n\n\nI think the only problem here is that people are a bunch of simps who should know better to begin with. This whole description of Midori \"preying\" on people is entirely parasocial.",
            "Yeah MGS4 had a lot of PS3 specific features like the gyro, pressure sensitive stuff and the PS1 emulated segments that are definitely going to take a lot of effort to be implemented. V probably doesn't need a rerelease, they could bundle the Definitive Experience with the Master Collection (like how DMC4:SE was bundled with the HD Collection).\n\nOther than that they'll have to add Peace Walker and Rising, both of those run on Xbox through backwards emulation so the porting process should be easier.",

I haven\u2019t heard anyone delve into what that\u2019s about though, and so don\u2019t think that\u2019s relevant to their alias as Midori, probably some unearthed drama involving their real alias MysticDistance.\n\n\nBut yeah, that\u2019s as much as I\u2019ve seen at least.",

But most reasons I've seen phrase it as if this is predatory and sexual- people citing he \"knew what he was doing\" by acting cutesy, that \"he knew people love cute Japanese girls.\"\n\n\nBut as a guy, I think that's ridiculous. If a girl acts cute then she acts cute, that's it. I don't think there's anything beyond that. If someone finds that attractive, that's not because they were \"incentivized to feel that way.\" Especially in this context where Midori never took advantage of this- even lying about having a boyfriend to get people to stop messaging him.\n\n\nIf the logic was \"It's rude to fake being Japanese like that\", I'd get it. And I can understand the hate for everything else MysticDistance did, such as befriending people for leaks and sneakily letting the info out through an alias. Stalking Sega of Japan... I've heard of other things too that sound pretty bad.\n\n\nMerely *saying* you're female on the internet- on a site that has nothing to do with dating- is not catfishing or anything.",
            "It's so bizarre to me because like, lots of games and Discord servers nowadays give you the option to present yourself as female. The internet doesn't limit people by how they are irl- While this doesn't apply to being Japanese, we live in an age where it's easy to present yourself as a different gender to others online.\n\n\nI've done it before, I have a sona I made that's female. I'm still male and I don't really *tell* people I'm female, but I don't mind she/her pronouns online. I definitely wouldn't take advantage of anyone through that kinda thing.\n\n\nAt worst I can only see people saying it's rude to pretend to be a Japanese person by making up Engrish and stuff, but getting caught up on the female part is dumb to me. It's the internet, why is someone being male irl and female online a big deal?",

            "> Like, as a male, if I see a girl online being cute or \"kawaii\" as people have put it, I don't see that as an invitation to start swooning. I'm better than that. They're allowed to be cute or communicate how they want without it being a big deal. This isn't even exclusive to Midori, this is just basic online interactions.\n\nCongrats, you\u2019re not one of the weirdos I was referring to. Which is why I specifically said he was catering to weirdos, not to men.\n\n> I think the only problem here is that people are a bunch of simps who should know better to begin with. This whole description of Midori \"preying\" on people is entirely parasocial.\n\nAgain, literally what I said. MysticDistance took advantage of these simps and Japan-obsessed weirdos, as he\u2019s among them. Where\u2019s the disagreement? We\u2019re just recounting the exact events that occurred.",

            "The whole Midori situation was so weird. The reveal that they were this other allegedly problematic user was greatly overshadowed by some extreme reactions to their gender. People acted as if they had been betrayed by their own mother lmao, reminded me of the worst parts of idol culture.\n\nIdk man, granted that I don't know the guy's whole story before the Midori persona, but my reaction was \"ok, they're a guy, got it. They'll keep leaking stuff under the same alias ig.\" But I don't see that happening anytime soon now, things are messy. The day that being a woman isn't controversial in itself can't come soon enough.\n\nSpotty record or not, I do wish to see what will happen with some of the predictions he already made, just for curiosity's sake.",
            "That's not \"catering\" to weirdos. It's frustrating to even hear you say that because that implies any woman on the internet whose expressing them in even a remotely cute way is \"\"catering\"\" to weirdos. And that just makes me sick to hear.\n\n\nBy merely SAYING that Midori \"catered\" to people I think is showing how low your standards are for that kind of thing. It makes you just as weird as anyone actually simping over Midori.",
            "Damn that'd be a letdown, I own Rising on Xbox but it's only at 720p and there's no boss rush. \n\nOh well, at least we'll get to experience V in 4k or whatever.",
            "Nah a port of the original game on PS5 is overdue at this point.\n\nI'm just saying that you should ask for the original game only, because Aspyr fucked up the KOTOR II Switch port badly."

Midori apparently said that there \"might\" be two announcements in Xbox (there was only one, and the HD-2D reveal of DQ happened in Nintendo) and Visions of Mana doesn't have a western physical release on PS4, which is interesting and may point to fragmented information.\n\n  \nEither way, the tidbits imply that Midori was just about of info anyway.

Its a super generic Switch Light console based on Zelda in general. Nothing about that screams \"remake\".\n\nRemake was an assumption because everyone \\_assumed\\_ Grezzo's next project was a remake, the most common comment being Oracles remake. That's it. There's no other reason to assume a remake, and assuming remake in general is honestly not a great take especially after how long it had been since Link's Awakening.\n\n  \nIf you know nothing about the series, its hypothetically possible to think remake when watching that trailer. But the evidence is Pyoro gets info from the eShop backend which literally cannot be true because the game wasn't added to the eShop backend.\n\nAnd even then, the eShop listing would show Zelda front and center, so it wouldn't be possible to think it was a remake. You can only think it was a remake under two conditions:  \n1- You barely know anything about the Zelda series  \n2- You watch the start of that trailer and see Link battling Ganon\n\n  \nThe cloak itself is a dead giveaway it couldn't be a remake because Link never wears a cloak like that in any 2D Zelda game (its closest to the Hylian Hood from BOTW/TOTK), and this Ganon battle doesn't exist in any game either... and we'd never see a trailer start with Link fighting the final boss, either.  \n  \nBut being as GENEROUS as possible, yes, its theoretically possible someone could think remake watching the start of that trailer (a number of reactions did that very thing). However, seeing marketing materials absolutely would not hint at a remake, nor would seeing the Switch Lite in the eShop. You'd have to see just the start of the trailer without any other context.\n\nYou guys are coping trying to defend Pyoro blatantly getting something wrong.",

There were plans for a female protagonist, who would once again take part in an underground workers revolution. There would likely have been a range of factions, from predatory corporations to homegrown Martian communities, with whom you might have had to forge alliances to complete your objectives.\"\n* \"While the game was envisaged as a \"safe sequel\" with a familiar emphasis on wrecking buildings, members of the Project White team also wanted to create a more open-ended play experience - closer to an immersive sim, perhaps, with opportunities for stealthy infiltration and player disguises alongside vehicle customisation. There were pie-in-the-sky aspirations to create an extremely reactive setting with dynamic dialogue, in which characters would comment on your methods of completing quests.\"\n* The internal vote to greenlight the project was 50-50, so it was immediately cancelled and the Fishlabs leaders were told to \"lay almost everyone not attached to an active project off\"",

Described as a third-person action game, the project was expected to be completed by August 2026.[7] By January 2023, the company employed 95 people.[8] In September, Embracer Group, the parent company of Koch Media (now known as Plaion), underwent cost cutting restructuring. Project Black was cancelled and about 12 employees were laid off.[9]\n\nFishlabs then pitched a new Red Faction game following the closure of series developer Volition. Despite initial positive reception, the title was cancelled in November 2023 and around 50 Fishlabs employees were laid off.[9][10]\u201c\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishlabs\n\nToday they only seem to be working on the Xbox version of Valheim.",
            "The Deep Silver story isn't consistent and might be a dev trying to save their own ass. From the reviews of the company we get that Volitions upper management constantly had infighting because of conflicting egos, and they kept changing the vision of the game. Some wanted a successor to SR2 and some wanted to make it like 3 and nobody saw eye to eye.\n\nThe report of Deep Silver changing the vision report comes Flippy, a Saints Row YouTuber who has a connection in Volition. From their report, the reboot was going to be a successor to the originals but deep silver focus tested it and made them change the game to a lighter and friendlier tone. And according to them that\u2019s what ruined the game.\n\nProblem is, this whole story doesn\u2019t make sense because it doesn\u2019t explain the bad mission design, bad side activities, poor game design and the buggy launch. The Flippy story sounds like Volition had the best vision but Deep Silver ruined it because they didn\u2019t want a gritty or a dark game.\n\nThat claim also doesn't make sense considering Deep Silver released Metro Exodus before SR and Dead Island 2 after, and both these games are way darker than SR. If Deep Silver wanted lighearted games then Dead Island 2 should have had a different script than what we got, and it's not like they could change the script after SRR got backlash considering their release dates. \n\nTo me, the whole Flippy story sounds like a higher up at Volition trying to cover their own ass and pushing all the blame on Deep Silver due to their past problems.",

People forget how many acquisitions were struggling or near-done companies and studios. It was shocking when Embracer said Deep Silver would be allowed to continue operating independently. They weren't making great decisions prior to the buyout, and it was insane to expect them to make good decisions after the buyout.\n\nCase and point: Let's flip the story and pin everything on Volition. Deep Silver signed off on everything: the story, milestones, vision, and later marketing and how they were treating the community. All of it was endorsed by Deep Silver.\n\nWhile I personally believe the majority of the blame lies with an out of touch company executives who mismanaged every layer of their company.

            "If you were a hot dog and you were starving, would you eat yourself? I know I would, I'd be delicious.",
            "Hell yeah! Still replay that gem to this day. I mean Capcom finally got the message and added a decent beat em up story to Street Fighter so if you just like offline content, it's there. Konquest from Deception is still my favorite next to Shaolin Monks. I don't get why it's so hard for them to do that today when it was so easily done gens ago. I guess because WB doesn't see how they can milk us. I guarantee it would sell well if done correctly.",
            "It's all Warner Bros and what they signed off on really.",
            "I actually beat the game last night (Yes it\u2019s bad but not as bad thanks to the 1000 lives code) and I always laughed at those deaths.",
            "For real, that would be perfect."
