I'm vegetarian and I eat plenty of fiber each meal anyway, and it helps that I really enjoy common sources of water soluble/water insoluble fiber regardless.

I also drink around 3, 32 oz water bottles per day which is close to 3 liters per day. i've had thyroid labs done and everything is normal, but honestly I never feel full. I've tried everything that is common on the internet, like eating large portions of greens/fiber, drinking water before/after a meal, waiting 20 minutes, etc. literally nothing makes me feel satisfied and full and \"done\" eating. It's really frustrating! and I feel weird saying this, but genuinely the only thing that keeps me at a healthy weight is that I'm constantly telling myself 'no' and denying all of the hunger when I know for a fact that I shouldn't be hungry. It's so hard to be constantly treating myself as if I'm trying to lose weight when really I'm jut trying to stay at the same weight. the other thing that helps is I really enjoy low-energy foods like vegetable sticks with no dressing (easy to pack as a snack) or fruit, which should in theory be a lot of fiber too! \n\nThe thing is, it's not bored eating, either. my stomach will make hunger noises (no, not digestion noises) and will hurt if I don't eat within the hour.

Sometimes, I'll go through the entire day wondering why I feel terrible, and then realize that I had only eaten breakfast. This is mostly caused by the fact that I don't really like eating meals or snacks throughout the day. I don't enjoy the taste of most food, and really don't like the amount of time it takes to just sit down and eat a meal. Ideally, I'd like some sort of food that is very rich in nutrients and provides all I need to get through the day. It could taste as bland as possible, in fact, I prefer tasteless and grain-like food (I eat a ton of Weetabix).

            "I had a random thought... Everyone complains about gluten, but there are tons of gluten-adjacent things in other foods. Gluten is just a protein. Is bean protein easy to digest? I don't think so.\n\nSimilarly, people sometimes claim partial lactose intolerance, but there are three different aspects of dairy: protein, fat, and carb. Lactose is a carb (sugar), and some people legitimately don't produce enough lactase to digest it. However, cow's milk has protein and fat that can also be difficult to break down, so difficulty with digesting milk could be caused by any three of these compounds.\n\nMy belief is that people who complain about gluten are really just complaining about foods produced from refined powder. Maybe their hippie almond powder doesn't cause problems, but that's because it's largely fibrous and doesn't contain the same amount of carbs. They simply can't handle refined carb-heavy powder and foods made from it. This is probably a symptom of metabolic disorder (aka pre-diabetic, essentially), but that's another topic.\n\nMy favorite way to consume gluten is via sourdough bread. I have always loved and preferred the taste, but I'm also satisfied knowing that it has a much lower GI because of the healthy bacteria.\n\nCurious about what you guys think.",

            "Hi, I'm on a never ending quest of trying to eat more protein, even better 20g of protein at breakfast without eating yoghurt/cheese (I have a food sensitivity) or eggs (they feel too heavy for me in the morning). I have PCOS, I'd love the help of increased satiety and I saw the people on r/PCOS mentioning some recent studies indicating that, all else equal, eating a protein heavy (20g) breakfast helped people lose weight and/or control IR. This is, of course, not the only thing I'm doing to manage everything, but it's a lever I'd like to try and use and check if it works for me. In general, when I track my food, eating enough protein is what I struggle with the most, even though I eat animal products.\n\nI come from a culture (Italian) in which breakfast is sweet. I've experimented with savoury breakfast on and off for years, but it just doesn't stick. The closest I've gotten is a one egg sweet omelette (too heavy on my stomach) or oats with nuts, but neither of these have much protein, in the quantity I can eat in the morning (not very much).\n\nRecently, I tried that stupid chocolate mousse IG recipe, which consisted of just chocolate and water. It was awful as a mousse, but I used it to add to my oats instead of almond milk, and that was quite tasty. I thought, if I can make a pudding protein-y, that might be an improvement..! \n\nI found [this silken tofu pudding recipe](https://thatveganbabe.com/high-protein-vegan-chocolate-pudding/), tofu has 4g of protein per 100g, I read, I counted my nuts are another 6/7g of protein in my breakfast serving, the oats have some.\n\nAnother option is the classical mousse with egg whites, I found a low GI recipe, which is as simple as can be: egg whites + melted chocolate. However, what to do with the yolks? I don't want to waste them, and egg whites only are not common products in the supermarkets I go to (also, what do THEY do with the yolks?).\n\nIs this a good idea? Is there any better advice you can give?\n\nI again tried Ricotta last weekend, hoping I'd finally like it and be able to eat that with berries and stevia, but no, there is no hope.",

            "Fasting once a week as a lifter/bodybuilder.\n\nI've become hyperfixated on maintaining a lean build - aside from constantly hitting the gym, this has meant eating within my maintenance calories and getting in that rough 1g of protein per lb of bodyweight per day.\n\nI don't mind calorie tracking and lifting, but what I struggle with is appetite. Aside from the constant hunger that I still get adjusting to my new(ish) build, I've always had a massive appetite - even when my stomach hurts from fullness I still want to stuff myself. I've kept that feeling at bay due to working hard to get here. That said, every so often, I hear stories of someone who doesn't eat for 1 24-hour period a week, then just spreads the calories they'd down that day across the other 6 days. Apparently it even has some kind of health benefits. I don't mind short periods of starvation, so that sounds like heaven to me - I'd be able to loosen up how strict I am with my diet 6 days a week, an extra 400 or 500 calories a day would go far for my mental.\n\nBut I'm not exactly sure how to implement this as someone with such a heavy focus on muscle maintenance/growth. Is it safe to lift on a day when I haven't eaten anything? And what about protein? I make it a point to always get protein in immediately after a workout - I know it's not necessary but I do believe it helps. Plus, that's a whole on day period where I'm not getting protein in at all, could that potentially damage muscle maintenance?",

            "I am currently on a weight loss journey and looking to lose about 75lbs to get down to a healthy weight. I am vegetarian (I do eat eggs and dairy) and prior to the start of my new lifestyle I was probably getting about 40 to 50 g of protein each day. Given that I weight 230lbs this was probably not enough protein for me and as a result I was constantly hungry, sacking and craving sugar. Since including more protein in my diet through beans, tofu, quorn, dairy, eggs and protein powders I have felt much fuller and able to stick to my meal plans. I am currently trying out whey and plant protein powders to see which I prefer. \n\nThere is a lot of different advice around on how much protein I should be eating I am told that I need to eat a good amount of protein while losing weight (at least 100g a day) to preserve lean muscle mass and to help maintain my collagen, connective tissue, skin and so on as a lose weight. I am also exercising and doing resistance training.\n\nHowever I also read that protein can be bad for you and that eating a lot of protein can lead to activation of the mTor pathway which accelerates the ageing process and and increases cancer risk. Looking at my diet tracker (cronmeter) my daily protein is about 25 percent of my calories and that is with a protein shake most days. \n\nI think I was probably somewhat deficient in protein prior to adding in extra but I don't want to now over do it. How do I find the right balance?

Used to be moderately fit running 6 miles a day years ago but the past couple years I was sedentary and now can barely crank out a mile in 10 minutes if I push myself. My day to day is low to moderately active but I'm attempting to get fit again. Currently doing HiiT for about 30-40 minutes everyday with some cardio involved. My maintenance right now is around 2500 cal but I've been dieting on a 1600 caloric daily intake. Consuming roughly 140-190g protein, 130g carbs, 51g healthy fats, and 55g of sugar.\n\nMy question to anyone willing to answer is if this is sustainable long term with the HiiT exercise without crashing and if it would even be possible to increase the amount of exercise still staying restricted to that 900 calorie deficit?

I workout 4 days a week doing a routine that typically takes me about 45 minutes and I've been meal prepping high protein foods in accordance. I've been using the Cronometer app to track my calories and macros.

I usually hit my protein macros pretty easily, with fat and net carbs usually a little lower but still about 90-95%, while my total calories hover around 90%. I typically eat a Greek yogurt parfait or protein powder, oatmeal and berries for breakfast, a chicken rice and broccoli bowl I found online for lunch, a protein shake, a peanut butter sandwich, and either a Quest bar or single serving cup of Greek yogurt as snacks, and then whatever my roommate cooks for dinner.

Two, it's a bit much to worry about eating perfectly 24/7.\n\nSo what I'm looking for are some steps I can take in advance to lessen any impact from potential binge eating. Could it be as simple as cut an extra 50-100 calories a few days before and after the party and doing extra exercise the day of and after?

A few years ago I ate 1200 calories a day and I kept this up for a full year--dropped 40 pounds, but in doing so, destroyed my metabolism. I'm hoping to avoid this.\n\nI use MyFitnessPal to track what I eat. I consume, on average--1 pound of broccoli per day, 1 tomato or 1 cucumber, 1 cup of raw carrots, 1 cup of celery or green peas, 1 cup of berries, 1 cup of oranges, 1 banana, 1 egg, 200g of meats (all fish or chicken). This usually leaves me with 200 calories to eat whatever I want (like a cookie or a popsicle), or a dollop of mayonnaise/tartar sauce for the broccoli. On days I'm working out, I consume additional meat (chicken, red meat, etc) in the amount of calories expended to ensure I'm always at 1500 calories per day.\n\nI'm not meeting the nutrients for Iron and Calcium--are there any food recommendations? I also usually don't attain the daily protein or potassium goals, but always come fairly close. I am lactose intolerant, so I'm unable to consume milk or cheese for the calcium. I know I can consume a pound of spinach to meet the requirements for the iron, but I'm already full for the day from the amount of food I already eat.\n\nI know the way I eat is... weird. But I do enjoy my raw vegetables a lot. Fruits can be replaced, I have no particular attachment to fruits.\n\nEdit: Open to supplements, but would prefer to get everything I need from eating food.\n\nEdit 2: Found the combination that is yogurt + Grape Nuts. Removed berries and cut the amount of broccoli in half, removed peas, added an extra egg. I should be good to go! Still have about 150 calories leftover to eat that cookie!",

It will cause a significant decrease in basal metabolic rate, together with this low caloric intake. So while you're losing weight now, it's very likely you will gain it back, that's why it would be better to take a slower and sustainable approach, rather then this extreme diet. \n\nNot even mentioning you are missing many important nutrients and it can cause more issues both now and in the future. \n\nSo yes, adding anything to this diet is beneficial, especially protein.

            "\u00a0lot to tell here\n\n\n1) Your BMR with your measurements is around 1700 calories (https://gymbeam.com/blog/bmr-calculator/). Noone should never eat below BMR. Not for weght loss, not for anything. Your body is STARVING. You might dont feel hungry particularly but that means nothing. For msot people (for example i am in that group too) hunger cues are not reliable. Especially when you want to loose weight and you want to eliminate the feeling of huger. So in a short period of time your body weill no more tell you that its hungry. And thats bad. You should let your body tell you what it needs. So definitely up the calories to AT LEAST 1700 calories. There are many people who thinks a 1200-1300 diet is great becaue they read about that. A 1300 calorie diet is great for a woman who only workouts 1-2 times a week and under 160 cm and 60 kg. But everyone else needs more. BMR is the energy what your body needs just for existing if you sleep every day the whole day. It needs to properly functioning organs. For example when i did the most stupid thing 5 years ago ( i had a 1200 calorie diet as a 90 kg short woman) i had side effects in 3 months. Dizzyness, blood pressure drops, not feeling my arms etc. The symptopms of underetaing are different for everyone and they may not occur for years. But in my case, i still have problems from that 3 months of undereating and i have to take meds for that for the rest of my life as a 26 year old. I hope that you wont undereating and my bad example might help\u0151 you to avoid eating such little amount of calroies (Oh, and i wasnt hungry at all and i was happy with my weight loss results. But i would do over if i could - but this time, the right way). Conclusion: eat more. And dont want fast results. Weight loss needs time. A lot of time. You can make it faster with working out so you can eat above your BMR and be in a higher deficit.\n\n\n+ you wrote that you will maintain weight on 2200 when reaching your goal. That would mean a 1000 calorie deficit with the ridiculosly small 1200-1300 amounnt. And thats normal for someone who has 30 extra kilos but not for someone within the healthy body fat percent range.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2) For a healthy person who has a balanced diet the only supplmenet needed is vitamin D in climates when the Sun is not out a lot. Thats all. ALl other supplements are for filling in the role of healthy and balanced eating. And the absorption is soo much worse than in any real food. So my recommendation is to forget everything else from your list. If you will have a great diet, totally unnecessarly and you will pee out the rest so you are paying to the toilet. An other thought: gralic is not better than any other seasoning or vegetable. Its just all over the internet. But all fruit, vegetables, legumes, seasonings etc are superfood. All of them. Every one of them has different micronutrient profile and you need all micronutrients. Not just the ones in garlic. And if you have variety in your diet you will have enough from everything.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3) breakfast - forget that olive oil! same thing as garlic. It has great stuff. As ton of other food has too. And you are wasting 240 calories on oil alone. From that you can have soo much other nutrients as well. Also I read that line and felt acid in my stomach right a way. It doesnt sound great for any of your body parts to start your day with such high amount of fat. Especially with the nuts. So i recommend to totally avoid that high amount of olive oil in the morning. Is it good for you if you incorporate in your diet sometimes? Yes! But is it ok to consume that much and has benefits? No.\n\n\nI would increase the amount of nuts (and change up sometimes for variety). The reocmmendation in mycountry is 2x20 grams. Totally fine to eat more or less. Its just an example that you dont have to be afraid of nuts. They are great and tasty.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4) breakfast - i dont see right. do you consume 250 calories worth of honey or is that the shake? But overall you should know that honey is sugar. It has great antioxidants and minerals. But sugar. So consume it in moderation.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5) breakfast - i dont see any carbs or fiber. and thoose are extremely important. especially in the morning. every meal should contain some fat, carbs, fiber and protein as well. It will make the meal easy on the blood sugar level and will kepp you full for longer. So add carbs and more fiber. Fruit in the shake or veggies on the side.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6) i would totally avoid to have a protein drink as a base of a weight loss diet. if you want to loose weight you will eat less and you have to have the same nutrient amount as eating much more while maintaining. So you have to be extra careful with variety. Drinking a shake like that wont give you nutrients. It will give you protein. And thats all. But if you make a smoothie bowl with cottage cheese or greek youghurt blended in as protein, fruit and nuts on top for fiber and fat and fruit and maybe oats for carbs, it wont only keep you full for longer but the cottage vcheese/ricotta alone will have selenium, magnesium, calcium, vitamin b-s etc. If you make the smae thing with protein drink, you will have only protein. So i would definitely look for 4 to 5 breakfast options with protein, carbs, fat and fiber. obne or two can have a protein drink or powder but not all of them. eat the real food.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7) the rest of the diet is kind of a mess for me. you dont write down food pairing and amounts and maybe timing. so hard to tell. And you dont wrote protein, fat and carbs in grams. But overall my guess is that you avpid carbs too much. And i hope that thoose you wrote are not the only sources of protein and carbs what you eat. because variety is really important for your health. Example: carbs can be oats, pasta, rice, couscous, buckwheat, lentils, beans, couscous, millet, wholemeal bread etc. And protein has other great sources too. Dont think them as protein r carb sources but think about them as yummy food what will nourish your body. If you allow yourself to eat quinoa instead of oats, you will have a ton more possibility in term of food and meal choice which means more ingredient and variety in your diet. and that is always good.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n8) be careful. you might see food as calorie and not food based on your writing. So you might want to rethink your approach to avoid an ED. If you only wrote calories for us as amounts then sorry for this comment.\n\n\n\n\n9) fruit and veg are great. Keep them",

And try to eat variety.\u00a0\n\n\nPersonalized thoughts\n- soy and pasta is great for the tupperware just add at least a cup and at least 2 cups of veg to it in some form. And also, limit to 3 times a week or less. So you will have room for variety.\u00a0\n- you can totally eat pb on white bread if you like it. Just eat a piece of fruit with it for fiber. So it fill you up more and has antioxidants, vitamins and minerals as well\n- water is awesome\n- just have much more variety in your diet overall\n\n\n\"But i never get full, despite all the carbs, calories and protein. \"\nFor satiety you need protein, carbs (slow absorption carbs like grains, potatao, wholegrain pastry, legumes etc), fat! and fiber. For example a rice+ broccoli+ chicjen breast wont fill anyone up for a long time because it doesnt have fat to alow down the absorption. Changing the breast to thigh or adding an olive oil dressed salad would make it better.\u00a0\nAnd veggies are also importsnt for satiety (fiber). Add veggies. A ton. For every meal.\u00a0",
            "Ig the meal plan was assembled by a health care professional, ask them. Thats the best.\u00a0\nThe rest depends on the goal and other perosnal factors but overall i would eat the same amount of calories from beans than from the bread",
            "Most of the excess citamins and minerals go out with peeing. I dont think that theese are connected. But of course, it might happen",
            "\"\u00a0\u00a0Its roughly the same everyday\"\n\u00a0Its a problem. Variety is extremely important.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Otherwise if you feel good then overall not that bad. I would add at least a piece of fruit or a cup to brwkfast, at least 1.5 cup of veg to lunch\n\n\n\u00a0And variety. Change up the protein sources. I miss some fat source from dinner. It slows down the absorption if the meal contains all macros.\u00a0 I miss fiber too. But veg will solve soma of that. If you change up the rice time to time to millet, buckwheat, barley etc it will help to.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBreakfast is low nutrition, pb is great, great amount, jam ok if you love it. Rice cake sounds a bad choice. If you extremely love the taste and texture and enjoy then of course it can be part of a healthy balanced diet. But you should know that its ultra processed, very low in maceonutrient, no fiber and fast absorption. So it will literally make you hungry. Eating a slice of eholegrain or rye bread would be a better choice.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Your diet is lacking in any legume, includes soo little diary and no red meat. At first sight, iron intske is definitely close to zero. But eliminating full food grouls make a hogher possbility to undereat some nutrients\n\n\nIts not a nutirtionally ideal or good choice to have protein powder as a base of your diet. Always try to eat your need from real food. If you cant, you can supplement eith powder. For example you are on a birthday party, eating a slice of cake as a meal so you eont reach your protein goal. In that case, supplementing is great. But only for supplementing. Not every day as a base of your diet.\u00a0\n\n\nI wrote about it more here in point 6\u00a0\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1c4cxiv/comment/l5frg8n/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n\nIf you need that much protein that you can only eat it from powders daily, your protein goal is probably too high. Its the case for most people who dont eat variety because they want to reach the protein goal so badly that they restrict every meal and build them around a ton of protein\n\n\nYou are limiting the food you consume very much. There are plenty of great protejn and caeb sources what you can consume in rotation. Examples here: https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1c4cxiv/comment/l66b9ta/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button",
            "You should decide on a reliable information source and stick to that. I highly recommend WHO recommendations. (By suggestions are based on that)\u00a0\nWHO says 55 to 75 energy percent of carbs for an averge healthy person\n15 to 20 energy percemt of protein 15 to 30 fat\nTheese are the basics. For every human it can be adjusted to specific needs.\u00a0\n\n\nFor keeping and building muscle 1.6 gr/kg protekn intake will provide the most ideal outcome. But usually for most people 1.2 gr/kg is just enough. So i would aim for between thoose numbers in terms of protein.\u00a0\n\n\nFor hormonal health 40 gr of fat is required every day. At least. It can be more but not less.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd since you are quite small so the calorie intake eont be humingous this will result in around 45 to 50 energy percent of carbs.\u00a0\n\n\nYou can try a distfibution and afjust if needed within the ranges\n\n\n\n\nAbout keto: dont do it! It is impossible to have a healthy keto. This shows that there is no science based evidence behind keto (its great for certain diseases with medical monitoring with certain cases but thats all. You wont find a certified registered dietitian recommending keto, never, ever to anyone). Our body needs carbs. Yes, can function wothout them but not easily and not healtily. And think abkut it: recommended fiber intake for gut health is at least 30 grams of fiber per day. Keto is around that number in terms of carbs. So it means that you should chew on pure fiber to have the need. Highly unlikely. Not to mention micronutrients in legumes and grains, or the huge amount of saturated fat what keto people eat. Not healthy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd about 1000 to 2000 calories: i would increase my calorie intake with 100 calories in every 2-3 days so the body has time to adjust.\u00a0",

Maybe your body needs less protin and more carbs. Or less carbs more fat. You should try different ratios for a few week. Also huge hunger can be caused by a not well compohnded daily eating. For example (bad example)\u00a0\n- morning: coffe with milk\u00a0\n- 10am: rolled oats cooked in almond milk, fruit on top\u00a0\n- 4 pm: chicken breast, rice, broccoli\n-7 pm: eholemeal turke- sandwich from cream cheese, tuekey alices and some lettuce in it\u00a0\n1am: you eat out the whole feidge because you are starved. But the person doesnt understand why because he ate right.\u00a0\nProblems (and think about it if you bave the same or at least a few of them or not)\u00a0\n- milk has sugar and on an empty stomach your day will start with a huge blood sugar spike. It can be preventes if you have a few crackers with it\n- oats has no fat , small fiber, no protein. Only yummy carbs. You ate 53 GI oats but cooking it and pairing it with only fruit make it soo much more a fast carb than addjng vottage cheese for protein, nuts for fat and then fruit. This oat+furit meal alone would also cause a huge bloodsugar spike and ceush if this would be the first hreakfast\n- huuuge gap between two meals. Way too much. It will be suvstituded at 1 am\n- meal doesnt have any fat so it wont be ideal in terma of absorption. Also not much taste so you will hate it and sour stomach might be satiated for a while but mentally you wont be.\u00a0\n- overall too small calorie amount during the day. It wi be substituted with a huge fridge eating at night. Maybe plus a meal would be enough arou d 1 pm but because of starvation you will eat 4 or 5 worth of meals at 1am.\u00a0\nOverall i dont say that you have any of thoose above but if you have, theese might cause your hunger. Including the missing of mental satiation.

She hated that she had to wsste 30 mins for eating the 3 meals.
