            "I get what you mean but it's not just about the art itself, it's the way he tattoos that's the biggest issue to me. He's risking some serious infections by doing this, I mean the wine stain tat was literally done through a shirt. I just hope the people he does this to are informed of the risk.\n\nAlso yikes, didn't know that.",
            "I mean you can\u2019t deny these all look like shit right? they all look unfinished or just like straight up nonsense",
            "Idk I\u2019m not a tattoo artist but I think there\u2019s a difference between doing thing that are requested and actively seeking work that have a good chance of becoming a serious regret. \n\nI don\u2019t think this is the same as someone coming asking for a face tattoo when having no other work done on them or something heinous/vulgar. Some believe morally you should say no. Some believe it\u2019s a job, just warn them about the risks. However this is something he encourages. And like face tattoos, vulgar, racist, etc. it has a higher risk of being something people will seriously regret in the future. \n\nIt seems like, from what you\u2019re saying, he wants people to be a part of the performance. Which in that case he\u2019s putting these \u201cpermanent\u201d designs on people in purposely unsanitary settings and doesn\u2019t care. I saw a couple of his replies to comments saying they\u2019re not safe and he makes a joke of it. \n\nOf course the other person consents to the work but still\u2026 seems to me like they now have something on their bodies where the benefit of the \u201cart\u201d was solely the process more than the end result. \n\nThe raping women part I didn\u2019t know about, seems to align with how he uses people\u2019s bodies. There\u2019s women in the porn industry who consider themselves having been raped. They signed up to do an \u201cabuse\u201d scene but it goes way further than what was described. They couldn\u2019t back out while in it because of either fear or pressure or both. Obv the porn example is much more extreme but there\u2019s still the same idea of feeling trapped to finish the process.\n\nPeople getting these tattoos could have regrets mid way but now they\u2019re stuck with feeling like they gotta ride it out and hope it comes out ok. If it\u2019s solely about the artistic process then he\u2019s putting them in the situation where he doesn\u2019t care if the tattoo itself looks good because he just cares about the performance of it. \n\nI mean there\u2019s people on this sub who post their tattoos and say similar things. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stop\u201d or \u201cwhy did you approve it\u201d or \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you tell them you didn\u2019t like the result and wanted it fixed\u201d? You always get responses from the posters saying they felt embarrassed, hoped the artist would do a better job, didn\u2019t understand how tattooing works, didn\u2019t want to be left with unfinished work so hoped for the best, didn\u2019t want to be confrontational with the artist, etc. Many reasons for feeling almost forced to accept something they don\u2019t want. \n\nAgain not saying this is the same level as what happens to people in the porn example but it\u2019s a similar idea. I mean who knows if some of these subjects tell him they\u2019re concerned with how the tattoo is going and don\u2019t want to continue. And he pushes and reassures that it will turn out great. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s totally consenting anymore.\n\nAnyways, just playing devils advocate I guess. I thought of this but also was comparing this to the Galaxy or ocean tattoos that are popping up but look like a rash. Seems like a more extreme spin off lol.",
