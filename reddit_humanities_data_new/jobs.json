            "I am currently heartbroken of where I am in life\u2026. I feel like such a failure for not knowing what I want to do with my career as a 31 y/o. I have a masters degree but I feel unhireable because I pigeonholed myself into this job which is grossly underpaid. My job is somewhat niche and I\u2019m having trouble making a career change. Just had an interview a couple weeks ago that went extremely well (or so I thought) but didn\u2019t even make it to the second interview. I feel like a fraud and my confidence in myself and my abilities is shot. I thought I came close a few times but to no avail.  I\u2019m still stuck here and idk if I see a light at the end of the tunnel. I\u2019ve been trying to carry on this week by continuing the job search but my mental health and determination is suffering.",
            "I'm tired boss.\n\nI know I'm in a bad place right now. Folks at my company say my department is where souls go to die. I've become the most senior person in less than a year due to everyone leaving, and I have photographic evidence of my director rooting around in folks things which means I also feel unsafe at work.\n\nI've applied and apparently the pay I am asking for is too high. I have 5 years of corporate experience but I guess over 70 k is too much despite getting a 75k offer years ago. I shoulda taken that offer tbh.\n\n\nI'm still applying. I want to give up so bad but I can't. I don't feel safe at work knowing I'm a target now that all my other coworkers have left. I don't feel safe bringing my medication into work. I'm overwhelmed. I want to take a day off, but I currently have to work every holiday. I am saving my PTO for an emergency like being let go, or to celebrate leaving the job by going on vacation for the first time in years. I wanna go on a cruise and sit on the beach in a tropical place. \n\nI'm frustrated because I know I'm a good employee. I work hard, my team loves me everywhere I have gone. Hell I even have my masters. Between working in accounting, project management, research, and more. I can do just about anything. At this point, I just want a comfortable safe job to work at so I can transition the time Ive spent applying to jobs into spending it ups killing myself by learning R or other things like python.",
            "I feel more hopeful this time around? I have four interviews this week and have started applying for more temp/seasonal positions (as well as a freelance job and internship) in things that interest me just for the hell of it. \n\nAnd I\u2019ve found a few federal jobs that I\u2019m hopeful about more than anything even just for the experience",
            "I've been applying and getting interviews, but I don't get called back. I've been to several interviews where I thought they went well, but I never hear from them again. I'm now desperately applying to retail, but no luck. My car just broke down so now I'm limited to where I can go. I feel like a failure because I have a stem degree, but can't even get a job in my field. Everyone always says go for stem, stem graduates always get jobs on here, but when I see that, I can feel myself sink deeper into despair. I can't get anywhere with my stem degree. Not even in retail. Now I don't even know if I still want to work in this field. I know my mind is fully clouded now, I don't know if it's just me who's failing, if it's the job market, or what.",
            "Not feeling so hot. Hearing back from jobs in my career field takes 3-6 months now, just to get rejected (if I hear anything back at all). Been getting rejections from retail positions despite having experience. Doordash isn't accepting new people in my area. McDonald's interview schedule is full.\n\nI always see folks recommend going for such \"survival\" positions when you're in a pinch... but it seems like everyone's struggling now, and everyone's got the same idea to pursue the same positions.\n\nI have an interview with Chipotle this week, so at least there's that. We'll see how it goes.",
            "I\u2019ve officially quit searching as of this morning. \n\nI only used indeed as the other known job search apps/sites were all a waste of time for various reasons and factors. \n\nI can\u2019t take a pay cut in terms of starting pay unless I want to sell my current vehicle with its payment and get a POS beater to drive everyday instead so I can be able to afford my car insurance and phone bill. My current job just *barely* gives me enough to cover those three things after taxes, insurance. \n\nNo job is willing to meet me on starting pay. I\u2019ve applied to 12 jobs in the last two months with four interviews and no hits. A lot of them are using AI software to weigh candidates and I\u2019m losing out to AI. I can\u2019t compete with it anymore nor can I keep rewriting my resume to beat it or fit the potential job better. \n\nI\u2019m working my current job until they fire me and then it\u2019s onto the next which will be Taco Bell or something. \n\nI\u2019m 30 btw.",
            "Had a good internship my last 2 semesters of school (software engineering). The plan was for me to continue with that company permanently (boss and boss's boss liked me) and the company had a round of layoffs. My position no longer existed, so when the internship ended I was let go.\n\nBeen searching for 6 months. I've done hundreds of online apps, had phone calls with about 10 recruiters, contacted my old university career center. Not a single interview. I got a job as a bike technician pretty easily but it just barely pays the bills and it's not what I want to do long term. Don't know what I'll do once my student loans start requiring payments in August, since I don't really make enough to pay those. On top of that, I'm so exhausted after work that I hardly have any energy to keep looking for jobs.\n\nWhat's so frustrating is I have the skills. I did well in school, have tech experience outside of school, did well in my internship, etc. I'm not the best engineer to walk the earth or anything, but I'd say I have at least an average resume. And I can't even get a return phone call.",
            "After searching for work since January, I got offered a position today. I should be happy, but I just can't be. In my previous position I was making $50 an hour, full benefits, a pension, but now I'll be making $26 an hour, medical only, and 30 hours a week. Effectively this makes me go from around 100k to 42k. Unemployment is running out in a couple weeks and I need to take this to have some sort of income. This is the only offer I've gotten and I only got it cause I worked with this person before   I should be happy but I just can't knowing what I lost. I feel defeated and worthless.",
            "Currently applying. Sending out lots of applications but not hearing much back.\n\nThankfully I know my resume is good. I have heard back from the likes of Facebook/Meta. I just think there's a lot of folks on the market.\n\nI struggled because my last interview, I got questions from the interviewer. And areas the recruiter was looking for that I was able to speak on. It turned out they didn't want that at all. \n\nI curse myself for believing my dad and getting into corporate. I absolutely feel resentful for it. My dad worked at the same company for years and was a happy little pawn. A cog in a wheel. He's been lucky and survived 3 or four rounds of layoffs \n\nI should have spoken to someone with a different experience than him. Someone who had been done dirty by the corporate world before deciding to go.\n\nI just want a new job. I'd love to work somewhere where I can take PTO and not worry about getting harassed when I'm back. I have a ton of days saved because I'm not confident in my team in being able to handle it, or able to trust leadership.",
            "I don't know what to do now, I am trying to apply for Aerospace/ Defense companies but all I am getting are rejection letters and even though I am a recent graduate of a Master's Degree in a related Aerospace field. Trying to get into the Space Sector but can work for Defense. Just been feeling defeated and hurt in that I want to go for my goals in life, and I can't because I am not given the opportunity to show them.\n\nAlso planning on returning to the university for Aerospace Engineering but still feel unsure of it because of the risks involved and me being more in debt then I am already in. I been working in retail for almost 16 years, and I am sick and tired of it and want to go for my passion but its been difficult to do so. I apply but then get a rejection letter all the time. I feel hopeless and am I a sore loser.\n\nI want to leave my current job but I feel trapped, my life is in limbo and my future is in crisis.",
            "I'm pretty sure my job will be on the chopping block in the upcoming layoffs. I've been asked to re-do the SOPs and work instructions for my job. Did I mention I've only been here 1.5 years and am now the most senior member on my team? At this point, I'm so stressed out, I'm low-key hoping I am laid off, which is insanity, isn't it? They did host a town hall to re-assure people there won't be any layoffs. They did the same last year, a month before they announced layoffs. \n\nAnywho, I have 2 phone screens on Thursday. I also received some bs email to provide essay responses for an application I submitted yesterday (what is this, high school?). I'm also entertaining a recruiter that reached out through LinkedIn. I normally ignore recruiter messages but at this point, why not? \n\nMy manager is getting worse by the day. One of my colleagues called out today. I called out yesterday. Just awful and stressful workplace.",
            "I got another rejection, I\u2019m pretty sure they all see me as a spaz. I feel like a failure and a financial leech on my husband. \n\nI\u2019m really tired of it all. Why is it so hard? The worst part is I feel strongly I need to be hybrid or wfh because in office jobs have always resulted in me being severely bullied. It\u2019s so much fun having ADHD",
            "I got through a meeting that I was really worried about (long story, colleague was saying work was duplicate work, it was not, and I was very upset and rattled by that) \n\nMy boss is strongly hinting about a promootion so I hope that's on the way\n\nIn the downside, I don't want to be in my current town anymore. But the town I'd like to move to's job market is very weak and almost non existent. Bleh.",
            "I got a job as a medical receptionist then found out we get no paid holidays, very little actual holidays, and we are swamped with phone calls all day. It\u2019s very stressful and low pay. I feel stuck now. I want to quit and find a new job already but I feel bad because they took a chance on me to work here and I acted like I\u2019d be their most loyal employee because I was desperate for a job. And now the insurance I have makes it so I can only go to the doctor where my coworkers work!!!!",
            "Another rejection which I\u2019m not surprised. I\u2019m not competitive enough.\n\nWhatever, I\u2019m also in the process of getting another boring job that will not allow me to develop my skills. Better paid than minimum wage but still\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do, because I wanted to go volunteer long term next year to develop my skills at some NGO\u2019s and I feel like having a new job would not help me achieve that :(",
            "Sad/frustrated that an interview I had with a tech company didn't go anywhere. Was told tonight that they're going to look into other people who filed their applications.\n\nStill troubling that despite having a Masters from a reputable school in Southeast Asia, I'll be going nowhere.\n\nOnly way is to wait for the jobs in DND to open up in Ottawa. Even that, I gotta wait until next year for results. And I'll be turning 40 soon.",
            "Does having someone vouch for you to HR does any help with you getting a job?",
            "Feeling a little guilty at the moment. Had a phone interview with the hiring manager for a role that fit my skills, but after further discussion, the role was not the direction I see my career going in. Politely turned them down.....well, that was not an acceptable answer for the recruiter I was working with on this. Recruiter sent me multiple emails about how this would be a great opportunity and to not turn it down, blah, blah, blah, but I was not interested (I had the gut feeling that I would not enjoy this job, and would end up in another toxic environment).\n\nFeeling a little bit guilty turning this role down, but I was not excited for this role, and did not want to be bullied into accepting a role that I did not feel happy going into in the first place (also, the pay was low and non-negotiable). I know its a job, but man, after what I went through at my last job, I'm standing firm on what I'll put up with in the long run.",
            "I\u2019m feeling really hopeful about my 2nd interview for a lead position at my company. Fingers crossed, it\u2019s tomorrow at 1p",
            "Accepted a remote job offer with Carenet Health & start 6/27!

Also if anyone else is looking for remote work & not having any luck please message me! I can help & assist you with the tools & guidance to land you a remote position. I'm not a scammer & i'm not here to promote any company. I'm just simply trying to offer my help along with the tips & tricks necessary to land you that remote position!!",
            "So glad im not alone to this",
            "I know how it feels, but there's light ahead. I have a PhD in an extremely narrow field, and on top of that, I live in a city where there's only literally a handful jobs in the. All the jobs are in the capital of my country, but since I have a wife and life here, I can't simply move. I've been trying to find a job in my niche for more than one and a half years. Several rejections throughout that time, even in jobs that have been eager to hire all my peers, I was the only one not being hired there (due to a misunderstanding but that's a longer story). Even rejected at a position because the hiring manager spoke to the hiring manager of a different job I had an interview with at the same company, and apparently he shit talked me.\n\nHowever, in two weeks, I'll finally start on my dream job at my dream company. Pays doubled than what I get now, and the work is so interesting. I'll finally get 6 figures, and work at a top 12 company in the World (biggest in my country and in Europe). It might take some time, but there's hope!",

            "Definitely not you\u2026 the job market is brutal right now. It\u2019s an employers market and entry level jobs are just flooded with applications. I definitely resonate with you. The same reason why I got a master\u2019s degree I thought it would give me a leg up with positions I applied for but in reality it hasn\u2019t. It\u2019s exhausting and I\u2019m drained too.",
            "Omg I feel you. Why is finding a decent paying job so hard right now? I\u2019m also 30 and feel stuck in low paying jobs.",

            "In the US, unemployment benefits, also called unemployment insurance (UI), is paid partially by employers. Sort of like how individuals pay car insurance, except there are tax dollars added in to offset the cost. When an employee is laid off from a company they can apply to their state Unemployment Office to receive payments. The states each make up their own stupid rules or hoops they make you jump through to receive the payments. \n\nIn my state of South Carolina, I had to sign up for accounts on two different websites. Each week I have to login on one of them to answer questions to confirm I'm still unemployed, then login to the other site to complete at least two job applications. Once that is done, I will receive a payment of $326 the following week. That is the maximum my state will pay out weekly. I can receive this for up to 20 weeks. For comparison, I was previously earning about $2,500 biweekly at my job. So this is a major income reduction and certainly not a motivation to stay unemployed for long. \n\nMy state disqualifies people if they voluntarily quit their job or were fired from their job for valid reasons. Essentially, the job loss has to be due to your company downsizing, reorganizing, or closing. Contract workers and Gig workers cannot receive UI benefits. If I take another job, the unemployment resets to my most recent employer. For example, if I take a contract position then I can no longer qualify for benefits even if the contract is short term, even if I haven't collected the full 20 weeks. So it limits my job options if I want to keep receiving it. \n\nIt's a messed up, difficult, and screwy system, but it's better than nothing.",
            "Hello! I will do my best to explain unemployment in the US. An employer has unemployment insurance that they pay regularly to the state the employee works in. If an employee is fired they apply for unemployment benefits through the state. The employer that fired/terminated the employee has the option to contest the employee receiving benefits. Generally if you are fired for cause (ex. theft, chronic absences) it is hard to receive unemployment. \n\nIt is very state dependent. I live in Oklahoma. We are required to wait 2 weeks before receiving benefits. So if I was approved for unemployment, I would not be able to collect benefits until after the waiting period. Oklahoma is very slow to process benefits. We only have 16 weeks of benefits. Unemployment pays 60% of your salary up to $519 a week. You have to complete job searches every week. The state can request the job search information to verify that you are looking for work. \n\nUnemployment benefits can be helpful, but it is time limited and not meant to fully support you. I hope this information makes sense.",
            "In America, each state administers their unemployment program differently. Generally, if a person is fired for cause, or they quit, they cannot get unemployment benefits. If a person is \"laid off\" (let go with no cause) AND if they have worked X number of hours in the previous years. It differs from state to state. ALSO - unemployment benefits are taxable, so there's that too. It's a weird system for sure.",

Exploit freelance sites to build a client base, trust me.. if your work is good, just like drugs, clients will call the last person that worked out for them FIRST, before they even look at ads and reviews and shit.. it's scary to hire strangers, they want someone they know..\n\nYour time is valuable, overbid slightly if you must, the mere fact that you value your time will make them interested in what you have to offer and what you're really doing is putting your foot in the door.. you can adjust pay rates later.\n\nClients aren't usually clear about what they need done, or they'd do it themselves or know how to find someone.. that's the hard part.. milking out exactly what they want from them, so they walk away satisfied.. and don't worry if you bid low, you can ask for more, basically everyone does that.. e.g. clients like \"my toilet is clogged, plunger doesn't work\" and you're confident their not using the right plunger but you also have a roto-rooter.. you get there and they need all new plumbing, because it wasn't installed correctly, just bill them and stop work (or keep working) and explain why it will cost more.. they'll pay.\n\nJust don't be a piece of shit and lie. Don't lie about your competence in handling the problem (explain you'll need an expert if it's beyond you, you'll have an easier time finding one than they will) and don't lie about the actual issues (don't fix it, if it isn't broken), that's how automobile maintenance got a bad reputation.. just be direct, even if the case is to say \"sorry, this is a bigger job than I thought\", keep the onus on yourself.. it's likely the client's fault for not asking for what they really needed, but that's why they hired you.. only some snob would say \"oh, well you said $50 and 5 minutes to plunge my toilet, but now it's much worse and I'm not paying\"\n\nDefine the scope of the project clearly and if you find the goal posts moving, communicate.. even if you stop work, you're owed for your labor, your time, the knowledge you imparted upon them and everything.\n\nMost people are easy to deal with, even if you're actually just lazy. They'd rather complain to their friends and laugh or otherwise get riled up in a comfortable way, than they would confront you. And, trust me, that angry overreacting shit is a defense mechanism, just keep your composure and be direct (that shit is some teenage-im-high-and-dont-want-to-talk-to-mom-so-ill-fake-being-angry shit).

Of fucking course the job listing had no information about the hours or times or pay or anything. Anyway they rang me and basically just asked me questions that everything I said was on my resume anyway. Basically they want me to work 4 hour shifts 3 days a week which would only be $180 a week. I dont even have a house so already 50 of that goes to my storage unit. Which leaves $130 a week :( And it would only be during the school term with no work during the school holidays.\n\n  \nAlso I already have a bad feeling about it because they were super rude on the phone and in the email they sent me after it said the interview will go for an hour which seems very long? They also said I would need to do alot of things including paying for my own childrens check ($80) police check ($50) First aid certificate ($220) cpr certificate ($50) Asthma course ($30) report children at risk certificate ($150) childcare certificate ($2500). So literally over $3000 for this job where I would be getting paid $180 a week which would take me over 17 school term weeks to even get that money back.\n\n  \nI'm thinking of just ghosting them and not showing up to the interview. Anyone else had a stupid experience like this?",

            "I haven\u2019t paid for a background check in awhile either. But our anecdotal evidence doesn\u2019t apply to this situation. Read the post again. I\u2019ve paid out of pocket for background checks before (there are services like Checkr, for example). You pay for the check directly, the company hiring gets $0. It\u2019s not a scam.\n\nNow, is it a shitty deal? Arguably. When I did it I was borderline homeless and needed a restaurant gig to pay my rent. It worked out. It wasn\u2019t a scam at all. It was lame, and less than ideal. But it was legit.\n\nI have a cushy six figure remote job now. I don\u2019t need to worry about any of this anymore. But I did, for a long time. And a lot of less fortunate people do. You run the numbers. Sometimes something like this might make sense.\n\nOn the other hand, anyone asking you to pay money for an interview/onboarding paperwork is certainly scamming you. That\u2019s just absurd. The lines are hard to see when you\u2019re desperate, though. And because we are fortunate enough not to be in these situations anymore doesn\u2019t mean that some of these opportunities might be the right decision for people, depending on where they are in life.",

            "He didn\u2019t have to pay $3,000 for a background check. He had to be $2500 for the required certifications\u2026this is true for many jobs, whether it\u2019s a certification or a degree. \n\nMy state requires a 90hr training certification for lead teachers and directors. He would likely be one of the only people for after school, so he would be required to hold that credential by state law. Most people only take a job like this if they already have the credential or are exempt through college courses (like I was).\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve had to pay for background checks from anything from a startup to the public schools. Background checks are not a scam? The school has to provide you with a number to give to the background check company, that is their own unique number.",
            "My wife is a teacher\u2026 what kind of school is this and where???  She\u2019s pretty skeptical, and hasn\u2019t ever had to do anything more than just pay for fingerprinting.",
            "I know people in the education and medical field. Required Certs are out of pocket since you need them to be hired. Continuing certs may be paid for by the employer. Everything else is on the employer.",
            "Public schools and childcare have different rules. In the comment you replied to I only said that I have had to pay for a background check in every school I\u2019ve been in? You get fingerprinted to get a full FBI and state background check, so this aligns exactly with what I said. \n\nIn another comment I said that preschools in my state require lead teacher to have certifications in order for the center to meet state requirements. They do not have to have a full degree, but do have to have the certification hours to meet the experience requirement. [Here](https://earlychildhood.marylandpublicschools.org/system/files/filedepot/3/chart-center-staff_requirements_jan_09_revised_march_2016.pdf) are the specific requirements. You need to meet one criteria from each box across each section.",
