It's so much fun, especially on the bigger maps such as Derail and Wasteland. 12 vs 12 feels like an actual Ground War game mode, compared to this year's \"Ground War\" mode that was abandoned and only has 3 maps. That game mode should just have the best GW maps (as in no rooftop heavy maps) from MW2019 and MW2022 reintroduced/ported. \n\nAlso the War game mode has been heavily neglected as well, at least make that game mode 10 vs 10 or 12 vs 12, because 6 vs 6 on it is slow and boring to play",
