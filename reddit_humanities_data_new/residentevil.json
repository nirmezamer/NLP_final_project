            "Remember Me is one hell of a game. It's got a magnificent mood and atmosphere. Killer soundtrack, too. Grab it. It's an unpolished gem. I like games like this. For example, back in day, I really fell in love with Hydrophobia from the XBLA due to similar reasons.",

You could tell that the story was what really interested the guys at Dontnod because the game that made them relatively well known, Life is Strange, eschewed traditional gameplay for Telltale style adventure game stuff to great success.

            "It was an instant classic. Completely changed the fate of the studio. Not saying they'd go bankrupt, but there are games that clearly shift the destiny of a company.\n\nRE7 did too but remaking the older games was a pretty good choice that allowed new people to get into the franchise.",
            "I'm glad Ada got a cake along with Leon and Claire from their shot on the cover.",
            "Definitely deserved imo. No over exaggeration, I've been gaming since I was 4 years old. The first game I ever played was Sonic 2. the second was the first Resident Evil. It's my favorite video game series, no contest. I say all that to say that after I beat RE2R when it came out, I remember constantly thinking to myself, \" Is this my favorite game of all time?\". Sat on it for years waiting for the excitement of this game to wear off....it hasn't. This is, without a doubt, the best game ever made to me. It's exactly how I always pictured a modern RE game to play. It had everything I ever wanted from a Resident Evil game. Yeah, it sucks that they didn't adapt the zapping system from the original, but I just can't overlook how they perfected the formula imo.\n\nTLDR: This is my best game ever made, so I'm happy to hear.",
            "RE5 is still the highest selling, it\u2019s sold about 14.5 million actually, if you include the re-releases, which many publications don\u2019t. It\u2019s confusing for many people with conflicting numbers here and there, but currently Resident Evil 5 is still number 1.\n\n\nCongratulations to RE2R for being as new as it is and being such a success!",
            "As a new fan of the RE game franchise I\u2019m glad that it sold so much and is doing well. It was really addicting once I got to it and I replayed it 4 times back to back. I\u2019m now on RE5 and loving the franchise so much. Blasphemous but I did not enjoy RE1 at all.",
            "It's not the best selling game of the franchise tho...  \nRE4 original has still sold more copies with 14million. RE5 is even higher with 15.6 million. Even RE6 is higher than RE2R with 14.4 million.",

            "I might still play the OG RE2 a bit more because it's just easier to spin up and play, but I have nothing but respect for the remake. I actually enjoyed the hell out of it. Sure, I was disappointed by the way they handled the A/B scenarios, but the game is still amazing in everything else it does. I think these sales are entirely deserved.",

            "Is that parsley on the cake?",
            "It is deserved as that was the only remake re2 had to my knowledge and the others were just ports of it released for PlayStation years ago, so for many, myself included this was the only way we could play it.",
            "The re2r was great. I spent a lot more time on it than re3, but only bc the game was longer and took more time to 100%. After like 2 1/2 play through in RE3R  I had the rocket launcher and it was like 1.30 to clear on the hardest difficulty. Easiest 100% is re3 by far. Big problem I had with RE3 was how scripted nemesis was, thought it was going to be a bit more like mr x in 2, but like 80% of the encounters with it are cutscenes. Didn\u2019t feel the tension or fear factor from nemesis at all.",

RE5 is still the best selling at 14.6M+ sales. \n\nhttps://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html\n\nAcross all separate editions of RE5, it finds its spots in 7th, 35th, and 49th place, for a combined total of 14.6M+ sales.

It incorporates everything Capcom has learned over the years developing Resident Evil.\n\nIt truly feels like the developers loved the original and gave everything they had to this remake. An amazing job by Capcom.",
            "It's really odd since RE5 is at 14.6 million and this is without it's Switch sales.",
            "I don't know if it's even a thing you can possibly repeat. 20 years of buildup to a remake that not only stood on its own as an amazing game, but was built on the legacy and nostalgia of one of the best games of its original generation. It's just so good.",
            "Incorrect. RE5 is at 14.6M, and that is without including 15 years of PC sales and 5 years of Switch sales.\n\nThese gaming journalists need to do better research before writing articles.",

            "\ud83e\udee1\n\nLoved it. Glad it's done well.",
            "That's good, I hope they'll make mire Resident Evil games in the style of Resident Evil 2 remake (low ammo, backtracking, item box, really tough reviving zombies and a complex interconnected environment layout (not just linear).",
            "Goddamned masterpiece. Played the original all the way through twice, and played the remake through twice. And somehow I get the urge to play it again. \n\nNot so much RE 3...",
            "Yooo that\u2019s awesome! I was just talking about in a ramble video I did about how RE2R was close to outselling RE5 but that\u2019s so awesome it\u2019s official now!!!",
            "Re 2 remake is one of my fav ones re 4 remake is good too but i feel kind of invincible parrying and melee everyone.",
            "Good game but dissapointing remake so im torn on this news.",
            "Well deserved. Arguably the best game in the series",
            "Good. Keep the format the same, follow the story that's already established...maybe a few tweaks here and there. Refine the gameplay here and there. Keep using handguns as main weapons \n\nAND NO LIVE SERVICE YOU CUNTS",
            "That's awesome!  Warn people if you're linking to Twitter though yuck.  I feel dirty.",

            "Speaking of RE 2 remake. Im stuck at the 3rd boss fight (hardcore, Claire) thing is I finished it but then the 4th boss fight I have no chance in. HELP! I\u2019m out of saves as well (max 5 for S rank) so whenever I die I have to redo the 3rd boss fight every time :(",
            "Agreed, i played the Remake like 13 times, it was addicting.",
            "I'm gonna repeat myself for the umpteenth time on this sub, but I'll say it again: \n\nRE2R made me get feelings I haven't had since I played og RE2 back in middle school. the horror, the tension, the dread, and the sense of wonderment were all captured and presented for a new generation. This is my current fav from the franchise now.",

It made the game a lot less scary, in my opinion\n\nIf they do remake it I'd love to see a complete do-over.",
            "RE5 mercenaries is still the best, total classic.",

I have it at 13.1 mil according to the sales data on Capcoms platnium titles page. 9.1 mil (original release) + 3 mil (PS4/X1) + 1 (NSW)= 13.1 mil.

            "We never really got a proper over the shoulder horror game from RE before this game. Most of OTS games were action and the ones that you could debate are horror are side games (revelations). 7 returned the series to horror and 2 brought it to over the shoulder. I think people were waiting for a game like 2 since the action games at the very least. I know there were people waiting for re2 remake before og 4 even released but that\u2019s not quite the same as what I\u2019m talking about.

The character in gameplay reflect your skill in a subtle way. \n\nWhen you're new to the game, Leon fumbling all over the place, stepping on trap, tripping over body, tripping over windows, fall from ladder, bumping into crowd. But when you gradually getting good, understand more about the game logic, animations and mechanic, Leon in-game also reflect that. You less likely to trip and fumble, better at dodging, near misses, not tripping over everything, less likely to step in traps, bob and weave through the enemies more fluent. \n\nYou can feel Leon getting better because you the player are getting better.",

The playstyle was punished originally by you having to use a weaker weapon to kick start the melee and the timing could be missed leaving you in a horde of enemies for the crime with the weaker weapon still equipped.

I had been saying Re7 was my least favorite of the new games just because it's so scary, but honestly I'm loving it. Might still be my least favorite, but it's still a 8.5\u20139/10 IMO. Pretty great consistency to me if the \"worst\" of the recent ones is scoring that high in my personal ratings.",
            "Thanks again",
            "There is literally no use arguing with re4r fanboys, but I'll just say. I frames are an atrocity in this game and this clip is perfect evidence of it. The developers did not know how to balance this game at all.",
            "True and it could\u2019ve been retweak a bit to make it not so, lower damage and stun durations of enemy, decrease time until the prompt goes away. These are good ideas but re4Remake went the complete opposite way to make melee not as rewarding and very much punishing for a player who wants to do a quick built towards melee, these builds sacrifice power weapons for weapons to stun enemies then going for quick combos to deal damage, but RE4 remake punishes melee builds, I died so many times during the intro sequence and had to break myself out of the old RE4 mindset just to make it through ignored all melee prompts because I knew I would be punished, a game shouldn\u2019t have a player have to ignore an aspect of combat to survive.",
            "Kinda, but also kind of necessary. Between the tank controls, stopping to aim, slow aiming speeds, broadly slow movement speeds, the kick and occasional suplexes are the only attack that don\u2019t require you to be still and they can only be triggered by setting them up. It kinda had to be that way for the old game balance. Recently completed a run on pro, it\u2019s definitely not too powerful.",
            "I'm more of a OG RE4 and classic trilogy fanboy, bought OG RE4 4 times and completed it more than 60 times. And I'm one of the very rare people, even in this sub, that still play the OG trilogy since 2000s 'till now. Heck, I'm playing OG RE2 right now.\n\nBut whatever make you happy ig.",
            "You\u2019ll get downvoted but everything you said is true and I like the game.\n\nOn the one hand, the limited i-frames make for really frenetic seat-of-your-pants gameplay and forces you to respect every enemy. But on the other hand, it disincentivises one of the most fun parts of the game: nailing those perfect parries then kicking their lights out. \n\nAnd if you, as a dev, choose to make your i-frames so sparse you better make sure your hitboxes are on point. But RE4R\u2019s aren\u2019t even close to perfect. Just as an example, plaga spiders can hit you on a ladder when you\u2019re far above them.",
            "That's because this isn't the original game. RE4R's gameplay is designed to punish people that cheese the OG RE4 with over reliance on that melee move.\n\nAnd it's still possible to gear your game towards melee. You just have to be smarter in your approach.",
            "While I disagree with you, I understand where people are coming from, there should be WAY more i frames for melee prompts but I disagree with your perfect parry analysis because a perfect parry into a melee is almost always a kill and you\u2019ll know because it makes the crunchy sound. I like the less i frames in a way because you have to respect every enemy or they will destroy you very quickly. In the OG, if you know that guns one hit stagger, you can shoot once kick all the enemies down then immediately knife them making the combat essentially trivial. OG combat was very predictable which for some people is preferable.",
            "But what if I don\u2019t want to use it to cheese? I shouldn\u2019t have suffered such heavy punishment to make me swear off it and avoid it so early in the game. Hell you can even be interrupted by winking hit boxes due to the traps which makes for very unfun gameplay. Nerf melee in the hame to make it so you can\u2019t cheese with it sure, but don\u2019t make it so undesirable that you avoid it",
            "The crunch sound is a melee crit being triggered, that does 4x damage on a normal melee so in most cases it will kill but not always. \n\nAlso, the perfect parry does not increase the chance of the melee crit as far as we know.",
            "Then uhh... don't avoid it? Meleeing is perfectly viable in this game. Pretty much anyone that I've watched playing this game relies heavily on it as intended, getting off just fine. It has enough hitbox to stave away people around you, and the enemies gives you enough leeway afterwards for you to assess your situation.\n\nI dunno what you're doing but you're definitely doing something wrong if you have to completely swear off from it just to survive the village section."
