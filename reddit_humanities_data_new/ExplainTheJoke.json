            "As someone who operates a pizza place within 5 miles of the pentagon (Alexandria), it is a running joke that we are not allowed to know if and when we are selling large orders to government locales. Just gotta keep our heads down when John Smith orders 50 pizzas to be delivered to a private address on the side of town.",
            "I believe the same kind of phenomenon happens with Wall Street and stripper clubs",
            "A few years ago, the owner of several Dominos locations in the DC area noticed that whenever something big happened internationally, there would be a butt load of orders for pizza at the Pentagon.\n\nOddly enough, he went public with that.  Now the Pentagon has a policy to spread out their food orders across multiple different restaurants.",

            "Despite popular fiction like The West Wing showing White House employees eating takeout all the time, security protocols actually prevent them from bringing in outside food.  If you eat at the White House, you eat what the cafeteria serves.  I doubt this also applies to the pentagon or the capitol...",

            "To explain the joke, there\u2019s a theory whenever the US government has a meeting to make some big military move, they order a ton of pizza. So if the govt. says \u201cdon\u2019t worry about WW3\u201d but all the pizza places get a ton of money, they\u2019re lying.",
            "Putin's propaganda machine really wants everyone to think stopping them will lead to world war 3. Joke is we are in world war 3 and the pentagon needs to order pizza for the 24/7 work.

            "When the Iraq war was about to go down, the US had built covered parking at major intelligence centers to block foreign intelligence satellite imaging from showing how many cars were currently in the parking lot at all hours of the night and on weekends. Chances are, if there's a crap ton cars consistently in the parking lots of major intel centers, it raises some eyebrows, especially when they're not there usually.\n\nSo when covered parking was introduced, Russian intelligence needed new methods of determining. They used local takeout places to see an increased amount of orders leading up to announcing Iraq.\n\nPresumably, if WW3 was brewing, the takeout food choices in the area would see an increase in their orders well beyond what their averages are.",

The reason no one likes it that is a fan of star wars is simple: she stated in the beginning (i\u2019m here to ruin the series for the nerds that like it) paraphrased ofc. She has single handedly destroyed the lore, universe, and success of the franchise. It\u2019s not because \u201cthe white bigot incel men are phobes and ists\u201d it\u2019s because of poor writing terrible character development and the constant playing of victim when something does poorly. This should have been a learning experience to look inward and fire the writers/directors/show runners whatever. Everyone loved mando, rouge one, ashoka, bad batch, (personally i loved andore).\n\n It has nothing to do with strong female leads or who they sleep with or what their color is. Kenobi was ok it could have been so much better. Ingram did great with what she was given but her talent was wasted and squandered and she was given race victim lines to say. She had poor writing and bad development with lore mismatch. Not her fault at all. The fans are being blamed for not liking poor and lazy writing. Those same fans liked/loved everything else but when something rates poorly with them then magically the fans are the problem. \n\nIt\u2019s classic upper management deflection to it\u2019s \u201csomeone else\u2019s fault not mine\u201d.

The prequels gave the front and back yard. And the sequels just decided to make pot holes and dirt mounds everywhere As it just destroyed established characters, I think a dozen Iconic Locations with the Star Killer Base and somehow butcher all established lore to restart from scratch just to repeat the same stories that were already told?\n\nI can understand the hate for the prequels from a movie watcher perspective but at least it gave us something neat and new.
