        "content": "# Trials of Osiris is LIVE\n\nThis thread is for all general discussion, questions, thoughts, musings, wonderings, etc. for the Trials of Osiris.\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What are the Trials of Osiris?\n\n * Trials of Osiris is the pinnacle PvP activity. Every Weekend, the best players compete in 3v3 Elimination for one goal: Go Flawless.\n\n * To start, head to Saint-14 in the Tower Hangar and buy one of the possible passages (see below).\n\n * To reach Flawless and get to the Lighthouse, you need to win 7 matches without losing one.\n\n * It uses connection and weekly performance based matchmaking, which means you'll face teams with a similar amount of wins on their card. Matches will get harder as you win more matches on that same card, and for all cards, the matches you get will be based on your overall performance so far for that week.\n\n * There is fireteam matchmaking. However, we still recommend you find a team for yourself!\n\n * Power Level matters, however bonus power from the artifact is not enabled.\n\n### How Long do the Trials of Osiris last?\n\n * Event Starts: Every Friday at Daily Reset (1700 UTC).\n\n * Event Ends: Following Tuesday at Weekly Reset (1700 UTC).\n\n### Where do I go to find Guardians to team up with?\n\n * You can use the in-game Fireteam Finder or head over to /r/Fireteams, www.The100.io, Xbox LFG system, DestinyLFG.net or DestinyLFG.com, or go to the Bungie.net recruitment forum (also available through the Bungie App). Additionally, many Discord servers host fireteam LFG services.\n\n### What if I have a question about another piece of armor/weapon or general Trials question?\n\n * Use Control + F (Or Command + F if on a Mac) and search for keywords in your question. Someone may have asked it already. If not, ask below in the comments.\n\n---\n\n## Trials of Osiris Map\n\n***Surprise!***\n\n---\n\n## Rewards\n\n* Reputation Rank 4: Upgrade Module (2)\n\n* Reputation Rank 7: Enhancement Prism (3)\n\n* Reputation Rank 10: Trials Weapon _(Changes for each rank reset)_\n\n* Reputation Rank 13: Upgrade Module (2)\n\n* Reputation Rank 16: Trials Weapon _(Changes for each rank reset)_\n\n* Flawless Reward: **[Aisha's Care (Adept)](https://light.gg/db/items/2709776995)**\n\n---\n\n## Reputation System, Trials Engrams, and Adept Farming\n\nWin individual rounds within each match to gain Trials reputation. The amount of reputation you gain increases with each round you've won on your card. Earn enough reputation, and you'll be able to claim a **Trials Engram** from Saint-14! This engram can be focused into any currently available Trials loot you have previously obtained, or it can be redeemed for a random Trials drop. **Your reputation increases after every match completion**, based on the number of round-wins on your card, regardless of the result of that match itself (win or lose, 0-5 or 5-4).\n\nOnce you have gone Flawless, keep playing! Every win you achieve while at the 7-win level, even if you lose your Flawless, has a chance to drop bonus Trials Engrams, adept weapons, prisms, and even Ascendant Shards. There is no penalty for losing once you've made it to the Lighthouse!\n\nWhen you're done, you can cash in your 7-win passage for one additional adept drop, granted you have gone Flawless that week. This resets your card so you can start anew.\n\n---\n\n## Passages\n\nName|Perk|Cost\n-|-|-\nPassage of Persistence|Losses following a win remove the win from the card. Reaching seven wins rewards the weekly Adept weapon. Reaching seven wins without having a win removed grants access to the Lighthouse.  This passage cannot be used to focus Adept weapons.|1500 Glimmer\nPassage of Ferocity|Your third match win grants a bonus win.|1500 Glimmer\nPassage of Mercy|Forgives one loss per run. Forgives a second loss if you have not yet been flawless this week.|1500 Glimmer\nPassage of Wealth|Increased reputation from match wins on a ticket.|2500 Glimmer\nPassage of Confidence|Grants bonus rewards from Flawless Chest.|5000 Glimmer\n\n\n---\n\n***Sort comments by New to join the conversation!***\n\n---\n\n[Archie](https://i.imgur.com/ai5QQ3f.png) wishes you a happy reset and good luck!\n\n---\n\n^Never ^forget ^what ^was ^lost. ^While ^the ^API ^[protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Reddit_API_controversy) ^have ^concluded, ^Reddit ^remains ^[hostile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification#Reddit) ^to ^its ^users.",

            "Crazy how trials reports challenge always finds a cheater and bungie needs us to report them. When a 3rd party website does it by accident.",
            "Just got the Wicked Implement catalyst to drop after a match. Sweet!",
            "I think I\u2019m generationally awful at trials lol.\n\nBeen playing for 5 hours on this persistence passage and have 2 wins banked.\n\nI guess that\u2019s why it\u2019s called persistence",
            "I dont know how this mode continues to get worse and worse every week. Absolutely miserable experience top to bottom.",
            "And I still can't claim the pulse that I earned?\n\nSeriously???",

            "I cannot get the trials access quest from Saint-14 when I have completed all relevant prerequisites for the quest including the competitive placement (and weekly replacement), the 50 kills, A Guardian Rises quest completed, and I am 1994 (2007 with) without the seasonal artefact. No idea what I'm missing so any help would be appreciated, thanks in advance",
            "6 khvostov yeah this weapon is fine",
            "Not sure I\u2019ve faced a single titan. Good job balancing for sure",
            "So haven\u2019t gotten any rank up rewards and can\u2019t claim any from Saint. Looks like I\u2019m not touching trials for the rest of the week",
            "Are adept drops bugged right now? After flawless, I won 6 games (3 unflawed) and still haven\u2019t gotten one to drop.\n\nEdit: finally got one to drop. Took 5 more :P",
            "Current meta:  \nBe prismatic hunter  \nThreaded spectre  \nSwarm grenade or smoke bombs  \nstorms edge super  \nliars handshake  \nKhovstov  \nshotgun\n\nWin",
            "Glad to know I\u2019m not the only one who had an absolutely miserable time. Not sure what they changed in the matchmaking since last week but if I wasn\u2019t 1v3ing every round I wasn\u2019t winning",
            "Last week I was going for the revised Shayaras Wrath, and when I got to rank 16, it wouldn't let me collect it. I picked up the golf ball, the entire thing glitched out and reset and no SW at all.",
            "Trials still bugged\n\nTLDR: Bungie says trials is fixed yet i still cannot access it. \n\nI recently got back into destiny, been playing since day 1, I bought final shape and all the expansions with the exception of lightfall as my buddy told me it wasn't worth it. The first trials weekend (last week) bungie said it was bugged and those who didn't own lightfall were experiencing some issues and couldn't access the activity, later, they said the issue was fixed. I still can't play trials even though i own final shape and all other expansions. \n\nSteps I have taken to try to remedy this: \n\n1. complete the climbing the ladder quest\n\n2. complete all new light quests\n\n3. complete my weekly competitive placement (twice)  \n\n4. reset my crucible rank (twice) \n\n5. restart my computer, sign out of epic, sign back in, boot up the game\n\n6. check the quests kiosk for the \"trials access\" quest\n\n7. check all my quests multiple times for the trials access quest\n\n8. talk to saint-14 (he doesn't offer anything purchaseable for me) \n\n9. switch characters and switch back \n\nI'm kind of at my wit's end with this, seemingly nothing I do gives me access to the only content in the game I'd like to play at the moment. Has anyone experienced this issue since bungie said it was solved? If so how can this be fixed? Open to any ideas here. Not looking to pay full price for lightfall for something I should have access to.",
            "I still can\u2019t access trials for some reason I don\u2019t get the quest from Saint-14, second week in a row, I own all expansions and nothing shows up for me",
            "Question for the trials bros: I never got a god roll cataphract. What's the best way to get trials engrams for focusing? Is one of the passages best for banking engrams vs others? I don't really care about the current weapon but I thought I remember some relatively recent change that makes it so the current adept weapon is prioritized over engrams or something like that.",
            "This week and last week I've been playing trials I got Saint 14 to rank 8 he hasn't given an engram for leveling up once or any powerful gear absolutely nothing on all characters it says something like I need to reach a certain rank to claim rewards but I have already reached that rank... I just want my cat armor lowkey",
            "Trials is a no go for me as a solo. Holy fucking shit the matchmaking is not only bad, but as you play you will very well notice how fucking busted a couple things are. Dear god fix this bonkers state of PvP and get back to what you were trying to accomplish before this.\n\nAin't no way in hell I am sitting in a bunch of 1v3 scenarios in this Trials lol. Insta death.",
            "how do i make it not black screen whenever i load into a new match, i can never see the opponents weapons and classes.",
            "Honestly the freaks in these trials games need to be studied. It is astounding how every game is a carry job",
            "Khvostovs. Khvostovs everywhere",
            "Can you get playlist catalysts from Trials?",
            "Anyone having issues with \u201csearching for guardians\u201d just not\u2026 finding anyone?",
            "Do we not get trials engrams each rank anymore?\nI also can\u2019t claim the rank 10 weapon",
            "If you're someone who doesn't absolutely love Trials, then do yourself a favor and don't go in this week. Rewards still seem to be buggy, but more importantly the adept weapon just isn't worth it. There are alternatives for PvE and for PvP even [the best build-crafters say that this thing is extremely mid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El4hg0TyNJI). When PvP content creators say they probably won't bother farming for the adept, that's saying something.\n\nFor the record, I'm not trying to shit on you if you love this gun. You do you, I'm just trying to save the average player time and frustration.",
            "hope khvostov gets nerfed into the dirt",
            "The khvostov is the most miserable weapon I've played against in a long time.\n\nI haven't gone a game post 4 wins where the enemy team didn't have at least two of them.\n\nI can shoot first, hit full precision burst with red death, but die before my second burst even comes out.\n\nHit two headshots with ace of spades? Nope, you're not gonna be able to get your third shot off before you die.\n\nIt's one of the most oppressive guns I've seen in a long time",
            "Got up to three wins. Then the usual happened. It's already almost 5:00 p.m. and I kind of don't feel like spending the rest of my day with this wall. I got the standard version of the strand pulse. I think that's something I can be happy with",
            "At what light should I start trials?",
            "How do I get the trials armor to drop? Is it just a random drop at the end of games now?",
            "What is the best summoner perk to use for trials out of kill clip, onslaught, and target lock?",
            "anyone else having issues with passage of mercy?\n\nHave not been flawless this week, was 6-1 on a passage and lost a game. Card immediately became flawed even though I should have had one more mercy.",
            "Is saints reward track still bugged, I\u2019m high enough rank to claim things, but it says I can\u2019t?",
            "OH BOY ENDLESS VALE IM SO EXCITED TO PLAY ON THIS DOGSHIT ALL WEEKEND",
            "Wish I had friends to do trials with tbh",
            "Is there an up to date TTK chart? I can't find one for the life of me. I got curious about how adaptive pulses line up now. Also Aggressive vs. High Impact vs. Rapid. Figuring out which weapons to run is driving me up a wall.",
            "I REALLY suck at crucible. I never play trials unless it\u2019s with my friends and none of them are playing this week\u2026 But I really need that pinnacle for the trials bounty. If I just play the match made version is everyone going to hate me and send me messages that make me sad?",
            "Primsatic hunter needs nerfs now. This subclass is the most obnoxious shit I have ever played against. It is literally the epitome of no skill + high reward.",
            "Will Aisha\u2019s care drop after regular wins? Similar to last week with the summoner?",
            "Endless Vale, ~~scout~~ pulse rifle.\n\nGood map, ~~shit~~ new gun.\n\nI ~~sleep~~ guess I'm going in!\n\n(this gun is also shit though, tried a bunch of rolls from Saint last week)",
            "Am i the only one that feels like you get no chance to react when you are being shot? Last week wasnt this crazy",
            "Do adepts drop after flawless? I'm only getting the regular version on wins.",
            "Wait I thought this week was IB?",
            "Just went solo flawless after not playing trials since Lightfall's solo queue. It's really not as bad as some people are making it out, focus on the obj and stick with team and you'll be good. \n\nRunning hunter with Ace and sniper and prismatic",
            "It's honestly unacceptable that this is the second week of Trials that people can't access because Bungle insists on dumb mechanics that they can't even get to work right instead of removing the need to do a Trials access quest. There is 0 reason you should have to do anything to access Trials. If you can't get something working correctly, remove it until you can at the very least",
            "This week is terrible. Last week, I had 13 wins in a row, today I couldn\u2019t get past 4 wins.",
            "Ye fuck it, not gonna touch Trials this week. Bungie really need to either tune down Aim Assist on PC or add Input Based Matchmaking. Its so fucking unfair to play against a Controller Player",
            "Yup, I don't know what secret sauce the gun has but I get absolutely melted by it, you literally can't challenge it with another primary except at long range with either a high impact pulse or scout",
            "Am i the only one that thinks this Gun is overhyped? Doesnt feel that good at all",
            "Why waste money in a cheater detection system with an permanently assigned crew, when a bunch of others will do it for free",
            "I went ahead and reset my rank, but been waiting all week for a fix.",
            "Have they even acknowledged this yet?",
            "ppl downvoting you are smoking. It's literally this all day",
            "Tbh this is pretty fresh. I'd rather fight this than Igneous for the past 3 years.",
            "I got a couple an hour or so ago. Not super common tho",
            "and all the warlocks run khvostov, no hesitations, speakers sight",
            "I never want to hear about anyone complaining about shoulder charge after a year of threaded spectre.",
            "Nah the true ez win is putting on speakers sight",
            "That matchmaking is just awful. Regardless, solo with 3v3 is in my experience almost impossible. These fools will just not teamshoot half the time at all. Which leads to half the games just becoming way too difficult.",
            "Ya it was bad today Khovostov is breaking the game it\u2019s worse than pre nerf immortal",
            "I wish it would match me with you, so I don't have to 1v3 70% of the time.\n\nNot that I want to be, but I've yet to be carried significantly (one match, my teammate got 5 kills in the first round, we still lost the match tho). I have to play like I'm 25 again just to win a ROUND sometimes. My teammates have shit stats so no ability regen, shit mods so no reloading, no flinch resistance, no increased aim assistance. And some of them just don't know the map, how to read a radar, and so forth. One guy kept getting sniped and apologizing until I said \"Bro, just stop peaking the middle lane.\"\n\nI'm ruining the speaker helmet and healing everyone I can, creating hella orbs with Reaper mod, and hitting most of my shots. It's tiring, been at this on and off for probably 12 hours. Got to the end once, up 3 to 0, then my team shat the bed.\n\nOn a serious note, I don't think PVP will ever be \"good\" until Bungie learns how to simplify it (which I get can be hard in an MMO or whatever the fuck). Too many players just don't know wtf their doing and they aren't bad necessarily, they just haven't put in the effort on nodding their weapons and armors correctly.",
            "Still bugged. I haven't been able to pick up the pulse rifle or shayura's they're just greyed out.",
            "Thank God I\u2019m not the only one. Your post looks like I could have typed it with my problem and what I did to fix it.  \n\nI\u2019ve been trying to go back and do all kinds of old new light shit hoping it would unlock but nothing works\n\nExcept I literally bought ALL DLC content and still nothing.",
            "same... wtf",
            "If you have a character you don\u2019t mind parting with. I fixed it by following a post on bungie help forums. \n\nDelete a character. Start a new character. Do the opening sequence. Go to the tower. Saint 14 gave me the trial\u2019s introduction quest.",
            "Bro lightfall is definitely worth it. It was the last DLC I bought when I swapped to PC but it has a bunch of great content. The raid is amazing, strand is actually crazy good and I played on PC for almost a full year, unable to use my strand titan build because I waited to repurchased lightfall like a moron. I bought it for $14 on CD keys and it was a great deal. I already purchased all the DLC on Xbox at full price so I definitely wasn't buying it again at full price.",
            "Did you start the guardian rises quest",
            "Passage of Wealth will increase the rep you gain and thus the engrams earned. The only post game drops are the weapon of the week.",
            "If you don't care about losing then playing in a team of 3 is best. They get like 50% increase in engrams",
            "See I came here looking to see if I was the only one, I hit rank 7 after playing last week for summoner and no powerful, prisms or engram",
            "I\u2019m having the same problem I\u2019m like what\u2019s going on\u2026",
            "Solo trials is really only gonna be enjoyable if you are an above average player and can carry matches on occasion. Otherwise it's just not worth your time imo unless they decide to bring freelance and/or the flawless pool back. As a solo player those were the best Trials weeks I've ever had but of course all the sweats bitched and moaned so they didn't keep it.",
            "Wasn\u2019t like this last week",
            "Wait until bungie fixes the server load issues. \n\nIn the mean time, open the roster and just manually inspect opponents as you load in.",
            "Yes",
            "It\u2019s not great in pvp but heavy burst pulses are genuinely way stronger than other legendary pulses in pve (to the point of possibly being bugged?). It\u2019s like 50% more damage the difference is massive, you can easily test vs an adaptive which is similar rpm\n\nYou can also get one from the raid but its energy slot\n\nArguably primaries are not really worth using nowadays with double special being so strong but if double special gets nerfed again this is one of the strongest weapons in the game",
            "True, the current trial environment is too bad. For ordinary players, it is not worth suffering for such a weapon.",
            "THANK GOD this is not Shay week. I would cry.",
            "Don't spend the rest of your day doing nothing for a mid pulse lol. Trials is basically broken right now with a couple things, and this map is dogshit for solo players. If you get one BAD player on your team, you are basically fucked.",
            "I would recommend 1990 at the very least. Anything less and you're most likely just going to be seen as an orb of power to the other team.",
            "1995+\uff0cOtherwise you will be suppressed",
            "And decoding Saints engrams. I only ever play on my titan, and then simply redeem the stashed rank up rewards on my warlock and hunter to get the latest armor.",
            "Roll random engrams",
            "people say on-kill activation damage boosts aren't great in Trials, but I've got to disagree. Pre-nerf desperado went crazy for me in Trials, and I think we're in that era of Onslaught. Being able to win a duel and then smash the other two players in shockingly quick succession is the second best feeling you can have in a match.\n\n...the absolute best is that one time I proc'd Revision Zero's sniper round, and, with both teams down to one standing, snipe a warlock right out of their well to win the match.",
            "Kill clip, if you can kill people.\n\nTarget lock if you are struggling. simply hosing down someone will have a slightly shorter time to kill thanks to the steady damage increase.\n\nOnslaught simply isnt going to make any meaningful difference in 99% of encounters due to it only lasting 3 or 4 seconds. You would need to encounter the enemy team one at a time, right after the other and not have them kill you in the process. Reloading for heal clip would remove any damage done to you, but cut the remaining up time in half. Giving you a handful of potential shots on the next opponent.",
            "Sounds like you left the match too early. Gotta wait until you see the XP for trials get distributed to you.",
            "the trick is intoxication!",
            "Don't play this dogshit lol. That's the key.",
            "If you don't care about flawless and just want loot, solo que, I'm a middling PVP player and as long as you get wins any games after 7 wins even with losses, gets you increased loot. I played maybe 4 hours of trials last weekend and got like 20 Summoners",
            "Trying to go flawless or just play matches?",
            "Duo or trios is even more of a sweat fest. I haven't been able to play with my friends in over year since they introduced this shitty new matchmaking system.\n\nIf you want any reasonable chance at flawless, just play solo.",
            "Khvostov is bugged on foundry",
            "Nope\n\nCan dive in solo and eat shit all day. Nobody cares.\n\nJust get your loot broski",
            "No, this is bungo's problem, not yours.",
            "Careful, you can\u2019t talk about nerfing Hunter in public. (Btw nerf titans again too strong in endgame activity)",
            "I have had two drop (non adept version) just working on my passage of persistence so yes",
            "Aishas Care is a pulse rifle.\n\nIt's the new gun for this season.\n\nYou're thinking of the void scout rifle.",
            "Did you try a roll with zen moment? I really like it. Thing is a laser for me on controller. But I also really like graviton, so I might be biased.",
            "sounds like you're getting team shot",
            "You absolutely can. The other post is outdated, this was changed a few seasons ago. If you have gone Flawless (on a non persistence card) you can get Adepts after 7 Wins even if the card is flawed.",
            "Only if your card is still flawless, after it\u2019s broken you can farm them on sunday",
            "Not until first week of July.\u00a0",
            "Next iron banner is the week of July 2nd. If it was iron banner, it would've started at reset this week.",
            "If it was IB it would have started Tuesday.",
            "It\u2019s a gambling game. \n\nI can\u2019t find a single team that can kill at least one person when I down two. \n\nYou got lucky, also prismatic hunter is fucking busted with the slow on dodge, spawning thread spectres, invis",
            "This is such shit advice lmao. It's like you people honestly don't understand luck and chance on this.\n\nFlawless on persistence is easily done for the most part. Lighthouse is another story solo.",
            "Lul\u00a0",
            "You have aim assist on PC, aim friction is what Mouse and Key players don\u2019t have",

            "I think it\u2019s just you",

            "Yeah they know about it.",
            "3?\n \nDid you forget the SMG years?",
            "We went through like 9 years of shoulder charge though and specter doesn't even insta kill haha",
            "Speakers is great on warlock but it's no where near prismatic hunter.",
            "This but LITERALLY UNIRONICALLY. Shit is so annoying getting killed in .7 seconds from like 27 meters while also dinking everyone on your team for 20-40 damage, making them (or you!) die that much quicker \n\nAlready one of the most annoying guns ever in pvp. Hate how bungie just has favorite weapons that get special treatment with recoil as well, outbreak gets a pass but khvostov, red death, and old Ikelos smg are and were unacceptable",
            "Can't believe they said they fixed this when there are multiple help tagged posts on the forums about this bug, wonder what it's like actually being able to do the stuff you paid to do. Hoping for us it gets fixed soon.",
            "Worked for me!",

            "Yes still nothing",
            "I fixed mine I don\u2019t know for sure how but what I did was I claimed the powerful engram from Bungie rewards and when I got it it came with all my trials engrams and saint 14 unlocked. It could also be me hitting rank 10 with Saint because it all happened at the same time",
            "I mean I am above average not super sweat lmao. I can't fight three people with busted shit no matter what I am doing and only an absolute monster or cheater can do that.\n\nSo yeah fuck this shit. I hope they can at least balance equipment before Shay week. Fuck put that week off another couple weeks lol.",
            "Last week that map was ultra shit, and yes it was just as bad lol. Maybe not as bad, but it was almost as bad and way different than the couple maps at the end of last season. Entirely different feel to everything now with the busted shit.\n\nMatchmaking is also not kind to me. While I get some competent players, hardly any have a mic, and it's just impossible with 3v3 these days. I really don't care it's not a big deal, but no way in hell I will suffer this.",
            "I was about to say this, I have a solid pve roll, and the pvp centered rolls feel like a disadvantage so far with one interesting meme roll that may be niche\u2026 given rewards are bugged I might be done for the weekend.\u00a0",
            "I mean if it's actually that strong, then fair enough. However, I would say there is still no reason to go for the adept. They barely bring anything to the table in PvE compared to the normal version after they removed Adept Big Ones (which you wouldn't use on a primary anyway).",
            "Nice. I can't snipe to save my life. But I have 2 rolls with onslaught one is adept one isn't. The non-adept has dynamic sway onslaught. The adept has heal clip onslaught. I'm torn between which to use",
            "This is how I\u2019ve been catching opponents off guard. 5/5 Breakneck with Onslaught and ricochet rounds. Run in the cubby? Bounce bullets around corners until I finish you. Love my breakneck. Sight is so clean.\u00a0",
            "Yeah intoxication and then not playing this game works best.",
            "Ah okay thank you I will stop resetting I thought you need flawless",
            "Either or, recently started playing destiny again 3months ago when they announced onslaught and brave weapons and I enjoyed it a lot but my friends are PVE mains and hate crucible whereas me I enjoy both aspects of the game PVP and the PVE",
            "Did you have to go flawless for that?",
            "You're absolutely right, got it mixed up with Aisha's embrace.\n\nJust saw the first word and jumped to it.",
            "tried zen/kc, ttp/headseeker, and moving target/keep away. none of em felt better than my other pulses/scouts.",
            "You can farm them immediately after visiting the lighthouse. Adept drops will show as \"uncommon\" rewards on a flawless ticket and once flawed switch to \"rare\".\n\nThe sunday flawless farm was expanded to the whole weekend well over a year ago to incentivize more players, because the average population has tanked.",
            "K thanks",
            "Just played a few. It\u2019s bad. I\u2019m like a C+ trials player and I\u2019m like a god on my team. Didn\u2019t win a match",
            "I think they're referring to Controller players on PC? Not sure which version of assists they get, console or PC (I'd assume the console stuff).",
            "You know that this also counts as Aim Assist right?",
            "OK, I just played my first game of Trials and we won. Get a few engrams but not Trials ones and no weapon. So I was like that's it, not playing any more if it doesn't give you what it's suppose to. As I'm going to orbit, I see that four Trials engrams pop up, so I go straight to Saint and I was able to claim the pulse. \n\nI don't know if it's fixed or if I just got really lucky but here's hoping they fixed it for everyone.",
            "It wasnt 9 years of glory. It was 9 years of real mixed results, peregrines was always a kamikaze satisfaction. Why you didnt see SC in trials often.",
            "It can kill and takes even less skill to use than shoulder charge. Threaded spectre is get out of jail free plus good damage.",
            "Nah I'd say speakers is way better than pris hunter. Used it last week in trials and this week in comp and it gave me the easiest games/flawlesses I've ever had. Literally permenant resto 2x, radiant, along with icarus dash and well. It's so free.\n\nNot to say that pris hunter is bad, speakers sight just needs an emergency nerf",
            "I\u2019ll give it a shot",
            "Nope, just play games on a 7 win card, I suggest playing on the mercy card anyway since you might get lucky with randoms. Once you stop caring about going flawless and just play, you get surprisingly good at PVP lol",
            "No these were just regular drops (non adept) post match. I did not have it previously unlocked or anything either.",
            "The only fucking Scout I even need is Jade. And with Pulse until they balance them more I really only use Elsie I have no adept roll of Messenger but still a great normal roll. I really hate how there are so few options now.",
            "that was not correct you can farm them every game. Just don't reset your card and there's a chance after a win for it to drop",
            "Yeah it\u2019s fucking gambling, basically going to the casino trying to hit 9 wins in a row based on your teammates and fighting their shitty matching making system. \n\nAlongside with not being a hunter main it just feels like shit to play. \n\nI\u2019m also Oceania and my servers feel so much more sweaty compared to queuing with my American friends last weekend and even going flawless",
            "I just meant they don\u2019t call it aim assist",
            "I mean this week the Pulse is all that will drop so you're gonna get one",
            "Prismatic hunter has threaded spectre which is get out of jail free with damage and if you have wormhusk it's instant healing. Couple that with smoke bombs or swarm you lock down their mobility.",

            "Eh, if people burn through it its on them.\nBut fuck time gating, not a fan.\n\nIt's just arbitrary waste of time, I would rather burn through the content and play other games than be stuck in a loop of time gated content.",
            "It's not about infinite content, it's about fun content. While fun is subjective, it is fair to criticize the current delivery of seasonal content. \n\nFor me, Echoes just isn't engaging at all. Both activities fall flat compared to what we've had previously (Deep Dives, The Coil). The Pinnacle grind continues to be a chore and I really hadn't missed it at all while it was gone. \n\nSo far, it feels like Episode Echoes was made before feedback in relation to seasonal activities was taken into account. The quality is a far cry from what we've grown accustomed to for the last 9 months (year?). \n\nI'm also not a fan of timegating content, I prefer being able to finish everything and go play something else for a while. Having to wait 6 weeks just to start grinding for a good solar rocket sidearm is pretty annoying.",
            "I think we all expected to at least be able to complete an act instead of the same weekly time gating. I don't think that was asking too much.",
            "My issue is \n\n1) Season levels are time gated. You're stuck at 100, can't go past it. So you still have to level up the season pass 50 levels when the next act drop. Why does the season level not overflow?\n\n2) Drip fed content is boring. All of the current seasonal model points \"log on once per week and play at least a few hours per week\". Most would agree that 'play at your own pace and time' would be better.",
            "Fuck time gating. I wouldnt complain about lack of content if i just speedran through it all and had nothing left to do. I would complain if the game wants to keep me playing for 4 months by giving me 1 boring fetch quest and some dialogue every tuesday. \n\n\nIts WAYY too early to judge episodes and usually the seasons that release with expansions are the worst. But man episodes feel like longer seasons with even more time gating so far.",
            "i think the acts themselves shouldn't be time gated, meaning that acts still release 1 - 3 but every individual act releases without any time gating",
            "Yes. Because they said it was going to be different, and it's not.",
            "We haven't even felt the effects of the episodic model since we're only on the first act so I find it kind of funny when people say it's no different than seasons. Wait for additional missions, weapons, and more in-depth story reveals. \n\nThe issue with a game like Destiny is that you're always going to have people who no-life the new content and then get upset when they've done everything. Adding content to keep up with that insane level of grinding is not feasible and would no doubt require additional spending - which people would also endlessly complain about.",
            "Now that the puppy love of new expansion has run its course for most people, it makes sense that these posts are popping up. New game feelings rarely last more than two weeks for people who don't touch grass like me.\n\nIn the first two weeks of TFS, I played just about 60 hours or more each week because I'm a hard-core grind kinda guy when I play Destiny 2. I generally run gms for fun, and like a lot of the harder content and grinding for god rolls and so on.\n\nSo I smashed out the legendary campaign, then went and did everything I could in the pale heart such as feathers, the  light and dark shapes, all the Micah stuff, the full khovstov quest(traveler balls and overthrow bosses). It was fun to do alongside the pinnacle grind.\n\nSo i did most of that, and also ran the story on my titan and warlock on legendary, and got to 1990 all in the first week. I got the rest of my feathers when dual destiny dropped, and I have been grinding the class item rolls I want since I got to pinnacle light last Tuesday. Finished the season pass as well last sunday.\n\nIt took me only two weeks to finish everything I was allowed by bungie to do or that I wanted to do besides grinding red borders from echoes, pale heart, or the raid. \n\nI enjoyed all of it for the most part, but it highlights that Bungie, for whatever reason, still thinks that time gating works for the two major types of people in D2. Im speaking of those who hardly play and the people like me who play too much. The people that hardly play can't efficiently plan out knocking out everything they want because there is too much grind for them, or it isn't released yet. The people who play too much like me burn through everything there is, and then have to sit on our hands waiting for more. Doesn't really help either side.\n\nOf course, Bungie does it for two reasons. First is To up engagement metrics. They like the \"played 1 hour every day\" versus the \"played 12 hours Wednesday and then didn't play again until next tuesday.\"\n\nThe second is that this is how they prevent content droughts artificially. The community gets \"new content\" once a week and thus won't be stuck waiting out over half the season/episode after finishing everything.\n\nSo yeah, prepare for the deluge of \"more content please posts\" and all the doomer posts for the little issues we ignored during the honeymoon puppy love phase. And of course, even louder titan doom posting since even the honeymoon phase didn't stop those from telling the truth.",
            "The dlc was great. The episode, just feels like seasons so far. Not the most fun or engaging. Also, the Pathfinder system kinda sucks. I hate being forced to play gambit or stuff I don't want to in order to progress the path. \n\nIt's only been out a few weeks and I hope they continue to bring the heat like FS did, but the episode is pretty bland at the moment. It's a valid complaint.\n\nBeyond that, the content from the DLC itself and exotic quests have been top notch. The dual destiny one is probably the best they've done and whisper/zero were incredible.",
            "The DLC was great and the raid is great. Seasonal stuff I'm not so interested in just now, but I got a long time to do that so I'm extremely unbothered by it being a rebranded season (which ngl, I 100% expected).\n\nBut Shadow of the Erdtree just came out and I have plenty of other stuff to play too so I'm chilling. I don't need to be playing Destiny every day.",
            "I still have so much to do lol idk how people can complain. Have to get 3 more motes for the khvostov, and while doing that get the exotic class item quest unlocked. I have to get dissecting and witness running down pat. I have to unlock prismatic on one more class. I have to find like 40 feathers. That\u2019s not even counting the other stuff I want to catch up on (specifically master flawless hunts for the shaders and maybe flawless Crota). \n\nThese people either don\u2019t have lives or are jobless kids in the summer. Between school year round and a part time job I\u2019ll be occupied for a good amount of time. I saw someone last week already at rank 100 and I\u2019m still only in the low 80s as of today, like wtf do yall do anything irl? Because Destiny is the only game I even play and I\u2019m nowhere near these people.",
            "No life's just need to find other things to do with their lives, \n\nI'm glad the games slowing down and has been like this for a while where there's no rush to do any of It, the only requirement I have now is to play it enough to finish what needs to be done story wise, get the season pass done and maybe grind a couple weapons I want",
            "If there was no time gating then those same people would power through the content just as quickly as the campaign and they\u2019d still complain. There is no pleasing these people, they will never be satisfied with what they\u2019re given. Even if the product is objectively good, they will always focus on the negative more than the positive. \n\nIf story content doesn\u2019t suck for them then the seasonal content does. If the seasonal content doesn\u2019t suck then the weapons do. If the weapons don\u2019t suck then new patrol zone does. If the new patrol zone doesn\u2019t suck then\u2026",
            "I hear good things about the expansion but my friends refuse to try it,I'm very tempted...",
            "It's been nearly three weeks, that's plenty of time to consume all of TFS content honestly. The problem here is that the episode content is very bare bones with little actual story and two activities that aren't super replayable. Many like me hopes episodes would be three meaty content drops rather than drip fed through the first half of a season like before, but it's just the same thing right now.",
            "Because what exactly is there to do right now? The only thing worth farming is the class item, which is extremely boring and tedious. It\u2019s not even worth it if you\u2019re on Titan considering the state of Prismatic. \n\nThe simple reality is that they told us echoes would be different and they SPECIFICALLY said they were shifting to echoes in response to the seasonal model feedback. \n\nThey KNEW that at least this Echo would just be the seasonal model with more time gated content, which was one of the main criticism of seasons. The upcoming ones sound like they could be better based on the theme, new systems, and especially the dreadnaught coming back, but we will see.\n\nFinally with the seasonal activities, they KNEW that we would have high expectations after activities like the coil and onslaught. I know onslaught isn\u2019t necessarily a fair example, but the point is that the activity in this echo is worse than any of the seasonal activities we got during Lightfall.",
            "One of my friends was 2000 in the first week with all exotic weapons and all quests done. \n\n\n\nHe quit a couple days ago kek",
            "who would've thought",
            "i mean it took me a week to beat the story as i am busy irl but it does feel stale i don't know why maybe after 10 years of playing the same game over and over its finally time to move on",
            "Expansion is great in my eyes best ever but the seasonal activity is in my eyes one of the worst we ever had it\u2019s not fun the hammer mechanic is stupid with randoms and one shots from hydra bosses ain\u2019t fun either",
            "I\u2019m still at 1988 light and taking my time. I feel like I\u2019ve played TFS a lot too. This game has a crazy amount of content, seems so many people burn themselves out on it",
            "Oh yeah I forgot people aren\u2019t allowed to voice their concerns or opinions about something they paid for, you must not defy the billion dollar company!",
            "How? I am playing so much and I still can't get everything done.",
            "18 days is a lot of time to finish stuff. I played almost only on weekends and have finished everything in just the first 2 weekends. They added good content but not a lot of content",
            "People who only play the game when there\u2019s stuff to finish don\u2019t actually like the game, they just like doing chores. \n\nI\u2019m shocked by the amount of people who raid only to stop permanently after getting all the red borders. Like wtf are you even farming them for at that point? You very clearly do NOT enjoy the game you\u2019re playing lol.",
            "I just finished the Exotic class item quest \n\nI feel like I'm overwhelmed with contents. I don't even have  time to play PvP.",
            "I understand that timegating can be annoying but people need to accept the fact that this is an mmo. Timegating new seasonal activities and quests lets everyone be on the same page, for the most part. It keeps the content fresh for everyone.",
            "The season activities or whatever they\u2019re called now that we got are both hot dogshit and awfully boring, it\u2019s more rewarding just going around the pale heart trying to get another class item. Which is also tedious.  Raid looks fun but my raid team can\u2019t all get off work on the same day to save our lives so we have to wait to attempt it, but at least GM\u2019s come back soon and the new weapons we got for TFS are pretty fun and prismatic is great. TFS has treated me well. Echoes have not.",
            ">\u201cI rushed to finish every single piece of new content and now I\u2019m bored\u201d\n\nThat's the funny part, this should be a congrats because now you can go play something else for a while and NOT get burnt out!! But some of these people grind through a multi month grind a few weeks then wonder why there's nothing to do. Go play something else ffs",
            "It\u2019s not because of Final Shape. It\u2019s because echoes so far is a stale rehash of the same seasonal formula once again. They shouldn\u2019t have bothered just rebranding seasons and should have been honest about it to at least manage playerbase expectations.",
            "I love the final shape but I do get that sentiment. The month lead up to final shape with onslaught and pantheon there wasn\u2019t a day I didn\u2019t want to rush home to hop on to try and get they next god roll. It took the whole month having a blast playing every day to get everything. \n\nWith the final shape after two weeks I have started the game up several times just to shut it down to go back to YouTube. \n\nI\u2019m not complaining; I just have really nothing to do or grind for and the seasonal content feels like multiple year old content that isn\u2019t fun to re run. I don\u2019t want to be on nesus listening to fail safe my second week of the final shape\u2026 I remember deep dives or the coil coming out and them being super cool looking and fun to run. \n\nBut that\u2019s fine, whatever. \n\nGreat campaign though.",
            "I don't want to play destiny forever so this works out for me. I like that I can finish content then just play every now and then as a causal game.",
            "Ive run through all the content and now im bored",
            "Its so much to do in D2.   \nSo endlessly much.   \nGo for titles. Enough room for playtime for thousands of hours.   \nGet the skill of a famous streamer..",
            "I don\u2019t mind the timegating of content because it gives me another thing to do every week. \n\nIf the season weren\u2019t there I\u2019d just have the raid, and maybe farming class items. The weekly seasonal things are a nice break and palette cleanser that makes me play a bit more, but in a good way.\n\nThe raid is like 6 hours a week with 3 characters. Farming class items sucks so I don\u2019t want to do it very often, but I will fill in the time. So the extra 2 or so hours of story stuff per week just breaks up the other monotony.\n\nSomething better than breach executable would be nice, but it\u2019s fine I guess.",
            "Nothing new here.. it's always the same.",
            "The time gating is ridiculous because in all likelihood we've already gotten all of the act 1 content. The remaining weeks will just have us do the same seasonal missions while we do old nessus lost sectors.\n\n\n\nJust because they stretch the story out over a couple of weeks doesn't mean that players haven't blitzed through all the content the same way they would if they released the entire story on day 1. \n\n\nWhat difference does it make if I do breach executable 10 times now, or once every week for 10 weeks? Either way there aren't any new missions after week 2",
            "People need to just go the ff14 route and accept the downtime. I personally don't even know why you would want to be tied to a game 365 days a year in the first place.",
            "Yeah I've burnt through everything with Final Shape and am getting bored. In no way is that Bungies issue. It's mine for rushing through it all",
            "That\u2019s why I usually end up leaving the sub for a while. People always find something stupid to complain about, and it\u2019s exhausting",
            "I\u2019m been playing destiny for 10 years\u2026..i get every expansion and play with friends for a couple weeks. The first week is aways great and I can\u2019t stop playing. Week two still stoked to play. Week three, kinda bored! It\u2019s just a very repetitive game and if you have been playing for a while there\u2019s not really anything new to that makes me want to spend hours grinding. I started a brand new character and once I transferred weapons over and got some blue armor i was 1999 and blasted the story.\n\nHowever bungie thinks i should play through all the legacy content in order to play the dungeons with friends\u2026..kinda annoyed. Plus Shadow of the Erdtree released just in time.",
            " I agree. On one hand, I kind of get the frustration, considering episodes so far seem like seasons rebranded. But on the other hand, I don\u2019t think players are being very fair by claiming it\u2019s more of the same when we are literally in act I of III. \n\nMy issue with seasons was that the seasons were 10 to 11 weeks long, but the story only covered about 6-7 weeks, then a large gap of nothing, followed by a finale slapped on the end. I think the point of episodes is to include more story content consistently rather than have those awkward gaps. I don\u2019t think Bungie intended to remove the weekly story beats. I say let\u2019s see how this turns out.",
            "Same as always: crucible is the answer: crucible always is a changing battle with yourself and not the game. Crucible through the insane content droughts of d1 kept me engaged. Crucible without actual new content can keep you going: I\u2019ve recently been establishing a new mastery of ace of spades. An old ass weapon but new to me. Crucible is replay ability  x10. And the 3 new maps are \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25",
            "Surprisingly people who only play one game and already have hundreds of hours will run out of stuff to do.",
            "I\u2019ve gotten to the point where Im just waiting for the reset every Tuesday and I\u2019ve kinda done everything else of substance.  But I also know I put way too much time into the game the last two weeks and, frankly, I\u2019m surprised it took that long.  The expansion is full of content and I\u2019m not gonna blame it for \u201cgetting stale\u201d because I spent too much time on it",
            "Name a more iconic duo than this sub and crying about they game. \n\nJust do something else if you are unhappy, why do some many people insist on coming here to whine. Just don\u2019t play. \n\nThe game has never been in a better state than it is now, we probably just got some of the best content ever for Destiny from bungie and still there is more crying than a daycare in here. \n\nI think the Destiny community as a whole screws to the side of unwell.",
            "I can go back and play halo without ever getting bored of the content. Complete opposite of seasons and or episodes in destiny 2. There's something wrong with the quality.",

I guarantee Bungie would see more returning players enticed by less frequent, but more substantial & engaging content drops as opposed to the current system. It's also insane that during the periods of time where the game sees its largest surges of player count, we go overnight from having an abundance of content available to play & experience at the end of the year to the stripped bare version at the start of the next. Wouldn't that be the best time to have ample content available to keep players engaged as they finish up the new stuff??

The campaign was solid but outside of that there's farming for exotic class items (which is pointless on Titan btw), doing a couple exotic weapon quests, and getting the rest of the Prismatic aspects/fragments which takes like a couple hours to do. The episode is boring as hell and they've done nothing to actually change it from the seasonal model to make it interesting.

            ">arbitrary waste of time\n\nIt's everything but arbitrary... it's like people are using words without understanding their meaning. And before people downvotes: I hate time gating as well.\n\nBut Bungie (just like most other companies) are using time gating as a mean to maximise engagement. They have the data to back that up, everyone in the industry does. And maximising engagement translates to maximising revenues. The last thing Bungie wants are a bunch of players clearing everything there is to clear in 1 month or so and then not logging back on for the reminder of the season. That's why content is distilled the way it currently is.\n\nYup they could launch the season with the Raid, Master Raid, all GMs, the entire seasonal quest line so you could play it all and then play something else once you're done, but why would they want that? You are at a higher risk of churn for any single day of inactivity you accrue. If MMOs (and all GaaS now) have daily/weekly activities and a similar content release cadence there's a good reason for it. And that's the complete opposite of \"arbitrary\".\n\nA steady flow of content also is more interesting for them, they want YouTubers/Streamers to showcase something new constantly over many weeks, so when GMs or Master Raid come out, they'll start making videos about that, then about something else that comes and so on. If everything is released at once, then all Social Media content get published together and then you have no \"fresh\" content for several months.",
            "The seasonal activites are my biggest and maybe only big complaint so far. Breach executable / enigma protocol are both extremely lackluster, especially when compared to the amazing activity we had last season with the coil. Now maybe theyll expand on these as the season goes on, enigma protocol is different this week with taken instead of vex i guess but the map wasnt any different. \n\nNeither breach or enigma make me want to repeatedly farm the content. I could do hours on hours of coil runs last season trying out different solo builds and it was a ton of fun the entire extended season. If 2 weeks in i already dont want to grind the main seasonal activity i think thats worth bringing up.",
            "No gonna lie, as more of a story focused player, I\u2019ve always been in favour of timegating the start of the seasonal content for like 2-3 weeks after the launch of an expansion. \n\nThere\u2019s so much to do and discover, triumphs and quests to grind, that I could easily wait for that length before the \u2018next adventure\u2019 starts. TBF I got back into D2 with Beyond Light, so still having Europa stuff to do mixed with Hunt seemed pretty jarring, and may have predisposed me to this idea. \n\nBuuuuut, that said, I do find the storygating of seasonal content to be rather stale. Each season always starts by posing a big question or problem, which isn\u2019t answered until the final week of the season, with most weeks essentially serving as filler with maybe 1 or 2 lines of dialogue of intrigue for the YouTube crew to salivate over. \n\nWeek one of echoes posed us with \u2018something came out of the traveller, landed on Nessus, and the Vex are acting weird\u2019. \nWeek two of echoes, no change.\n\nHands down my prediction is that Act 1 will end with Failsafe confirming Maya Sunderbutt is somehow involved. Act 2 will end with an ink blot cutscene of \u2018the life and times of Maya\u2019 and maybe hint at some schinanigans in the network. And Act 3 will end with some kind of face off where she will win and do a runner, and we\u2019ll be left with shit on our face and a \u2018well that was interesting\u2019 send off.\nThe issue is that all the weeks inbetween will just be more conversations peddling around the issue at hand, finding different ways to explain the same problem that was posed in week 1. \n\nI\u2019m in agreement with many here, in that each Act should be fully playable in one go, with a several week interval between Acts.",
            "Timegating is the worst. If I want to fly through certain content I should be able to.\n\nI was off for 5 days after wisdom teeth and I was so let down when I got hit with the \"this npc is waiting for something, come back in a week\". Then it was either engage whatever activity or a rerelease of the splicer activity.\n\nDon't get me wrong expansion is awesome story/mission wise but once you have a build and clear most activities the replay aspect for me kind of just vanished. And being in a clan that barely raids or anything puts a damper on most PvE activities as well.\n\nP.s. - LFG is not an option. It's a hit or miss and I'd prefer not to waste time going through fireteam members.",
            "That's how I feel\n\nFinal Shape and pale heart? 11/10\n\nEchoes? Like a 4 or 5/10. Nothing crazy really. Quite annoying imo since we are back with the issue that happend during plunder, deep and many other seasons; side objective in the matchmade activity that 90% of randoms ignore and even grief. Im out here, looking for the piston to get the plants and then I'm joining allies. It has been said many times but it seems bungie forgor about it.",
            "I'll go one step ahead and say that Seasonal Content as it is, is completely exhausted at this point. Not just Destiny, other games who have been doing this \"rollout over time\" format are suffering similar backlash recently as well.\n\n\"Evolving world\" was a novel idea when it first arrived, seeing a story unravel further week by week sounded neat. Over the course of years, it has become a formulaic \"Please experience this filler and come back next week for 6 weeks straight, so that you may experience our advertisement for the next season, which will also be the same thing\".\n\nAt this point, people just want to \"Play the damn game\" at their own pace, and just peace out until new (hopefully meaningful) content comes around. It has been 10 years and while people are invested enough to continue experiencing the game, they are tired enough that they do not want Destiny being their job, constantly requiring their engagement.\n\nAdd the fact that our main saga of 10 years are over and a lot of people dipping or have decided to not care as much, it's no wonder that people naturally feel like checking out more than they have before. This isn't about \"rushing content\", I am not going to play the Final Shape one mission a week just to \"pad out my enjoyment\", \"don't rush the content\" is a stupid idea to begin with. It's about the reality of this being a 10+ year journey that most people are tired of. There is only so much \"Shoot the aliens in their crit spot for 20 minutes to earn 10 lines of dialogue\" can keep me engaged, let alone entertained, after 10 years.",

Criticize all you want, it falls on deaf ears obviously. The Episode is rolling out exactly like a season. How'd that criticism do for ya?\n\nNevertheless, Bungie DID say episodes were going to be different and it hasn't been so far. But I agree with you PrisonaPlanet, if it wasn't time gated, all the players that have immense amounts of free time would burn through the content and still get to the point of 'the game is stale, already got my godrolls, no desire to keep playing..' and so on. \n\nI'm loving how it's going so far. I think I'm season pass level.. 20-something? Haven't got Ergo Sum yet, or Microcosm. Haven't even done the final campaign mission yet. Haven't earned the Riposte yet. I did get Still Hunt, though. I think I've only placed one of those seeds in the hands. Only beat two Overthrow bosses. No complaints from me, highest light level is like 1956. \n\nBut here we are, with the dedicateds already coming out with farming videos for class exotics, in-depth damage numbers for changes Bungie has made, already doing the GM 12-man activity, like holy hell guys.

While players do not directly benefit from such (annoying) design choices (i.e. they're not going to get paid because Destiny 2 is performing well), they do benefit indirectly as the project meets its financial targets. When Bungie wins, \"we\" also win (indirectly).\n\nSo yeah sure let's remove time gating, makes everyone happy (would make me happy too), then metrics for Bungie worsen dramatically (just see this thread with how many people openly confirm that they would just rather burn through the content and move on to another game afterwards) and eventually what happen are just more layoffs and then game content being downsized.\n\nAs much as time gating suck, it became a necessary evil for game publishers, especially since products are being benchmarked against each others. So it's not even like you can just unilaterally decide to put your community first by not relying on such \"anti-consumer\" tactics, otherwise investors will start to ask questions as to why your product isn't as good as [competitor product].

            "I thought what Ben said about the development of the Dread was really interesting. Seems as though when Bungie began creating the Tormenter, they knew that it would eventually be part of a brand new faction.\n\nSo I wonder if the original intention was for the Dread to be in Lightfall, but due to time constraints, they could only create the Tormenter.",
            "There's basically no way to build into grenades with Prismatic Titan. I got a class item with Spirit of Verity and tried to figure out if there's anything I can do with it, but I can't even pair it with Spirit of Armamentarium since they're in the same slot. No grenade aspects, just a few fragments. And sure, those fragments do some cool stuff, but nothing to increase grenade uptime. No Devour, no Ionic Traces, no Sol Invictus, no Offensive Bulwark.\n\nAnd beyond Prismatic, Arc Titan is still dead in PvE. They didn't even give the Storm Grenade buff if you have Touch of Thunder. I know they were a bit absurd during Season of Plunder, but there's gotta be a middle ground.",

            "I hope there is a greater shift in Titan design philosophy to accommodate more aggressive playstyles. IMO, the barricade itself really clashes with the way Titan subclasses are designed currently. \n\nFor example, arc provides a speed boost, a super that requires you to launch yourself at an enemy, aspects that require you to play more aggressively with melee, and a... barricade that completely interrupts this playstyle and has zero synergy with the subclass. Thruster was a great addition, but it just goes to show how out of place barricade is within this gameplay loop. \n\nThe same goes for Berserker! Yes, abeyant leap builds can be incredibly strong, but it's BORING. Additionally, it still feels out of place when your melee, super, and aspects are built for playing more aggressively. \n\nSame can be argued for solar as well. Barricade just seems like an old relic that doesn't mesh well with a lot of Titan gameplay loops.",

Sure, Ursas helped, especially in GMs, but never in a raid scenario. \n\nVoid 3.0 on launch was good for HoiL volatile builds. But these days if you want to use a volatile build on titan you basically have to use HoiL even in its nerfed state. \n\nThe most recent changes to how much damage bubble can take in addition to the removal of weapons of light and overshield just takes the case. How does this help the super at all? \n\nIt doesn't. \n\nSure Saint 14 is uh better? I guess? But now you have to use a super for the damage buff losing a lot of better builds you could have with say HoiL or a exotic class item which would enable the void class to have neutral game on par with solar or strand.",

            "If they give new Aspects, hopefully it's an Aspect from the Solar for Warlock, Void for Titan, Arc for Hunter. Not to say the new Aspects are bad, but this would be in line of giving underused Aspects into Prismatic. It could give the Titan survivability if it's Bastion or neutral game if Offensive Bulwark. Warlock could get Heat Rises but Icarus Dash is more likely given Warlock is already strong so a movement Aspect seems likely. That and I would love to Blink + Icarus for the extra momentum to maybe try blinking through jumping puzzles. Hunter will more then likely get Flow State to give much needed neutral game which gives so much more freedom in Prismatic.",

            "They have failed to flesh out the \"The Wall\" fantasy for Titan for a long time. The last genuine attempt was Void 3.0 and to this day Void Titan is the only subclass I've ever played that feels like it NEEDS 3 Aspect slots to feel complete. The Aspects for Void are so promising, but almost all feel like they're missing something meaningful. Except Controlled Demo, CD is awesome (could do with a way to generate VO from it though).\n\nWe need to have the original fantasy of Titan returned to the class. No option for Defense provided by Titans is even remotely useful, the closest being Into the Fray giving 10 seconds of Woven Mail instead of 5 seconds from fragments. And, they just nerfed the most iconic defensive fantasy ability in the history of the game in Bubble. I said it when they announced it and I'll say it again, there is no rationale that exists that can explain the Bubble nerf. It does not make sense.\n\nBarricade is annoying in PvP, but it has been left behind in the current D2 sandbox. It has no synergy with the vast majority of Titan Aspects, and are often seen as nuisances in PvE. Barricade feels like it needs to be altered to fit the fast-paced sandbox of D2. Bungie, I would like a shield.\n\nI hope they seriously apply themselves to deeper foundational changes to the way Titan plays. The class really needs it.",
            "Here's some of my ideas for Titan buffs:\n\nKnockout refunds 20% of melee on kill\n\nUnbreakable grants devour if you kill a mob with over 50% charge\n\nHammer strike applies a debuff called sunkissed. When the sunkissed mob dies, it applies 50 stacks of scorch to surrounding enemies\n\nHammer of sol super needs to apply 70 stacks of scorch on each hammer throw and also apply sunkissed\n\nThundercrash needs a straight damage boost of 50% (or more)\n\nNew Twilight arsenal super should apply a new super weaken called \"Twilight wound\" on direct hits. (This should hopefully gives titans a raid use)\n\nBubble should grant a melee buff (including swords) if in the bubble and within 10 meters of the bubble\n\nThoughts?",
            "Hopefully they figure out what they wanna do with us titans, bungie have really put us in a corner of melee focused builds and then punish us by nefing them hard once we figure out how to make them good, maybe even revert some nerfs such as the thrown hammer cooldown, I understand to an extent why its there but overall it just made solar more clunky imo.",

            "Considering there's been nothing but posts straight up trashing how they even shipped Titan prismatic that way, I'd say discussion started the day the Raid race was over and they saw those horribly skewed numbers. 5 whole seconds of a verb from a fragment is the best titans can do without double punching with Knockout and it's hilarious. \n\nThis is from a Titan main who just made a Warlock and just got Song of Flame and laughing at the difference in ability usage let alone survivability. But somehow someone at Bungie monkey brained the originally DEFENDING CLASS Titan down to \"me punch, different ways, I like colors going boom boom\"\n\nThe new super is so close, why couldn't they have a ranged void attack (they're essentially Season of the Haunted Scythes without the ranged attack/being fun to use) when picked up? WHY was it not baked in/on an underwhelming \"super\" exotic that while throwing all three on a boss you'll never run into the stomp zone, you can pull them back by... Wild idea, HOLDING UNBREAKABLE making it useful for something.\n\nI'd gladly eat my grenade charge (despite thinking unbreakable \"shield\" should be class ability based...on a shield lol)  if it meant all three Twlight Axes could be thrown again, actually being able to make use of the weaken for more than 2/3 of the initial throws if they even manage to all 3 hit the same target.\n\nSomewhat unrelated, before swapping I was running Hammer of Sol on Prismatic. You know, the version with zero sunspots, a few extra pieces of molten hammer explode (from 4 on solar w/any aspect to 6 explosions to compensate for lack of Sol Invictus extending super) \n\n It was honestly more effective than Twlight Arsenal, especially solo and probably going to be THE ranged option on Prismatic in 3s/6s fireteams as you can weaken with ease on every other class outside a mediocre fragment and a super you'll most likely only get weaken off twice, and waste half of it sitting at the bosses feet. (of course Tractor/felwinters helm/div exists, especially if tractor/finishers next boss can reach use it 100% for the 30% instead of 15% weaken div/grenades/etc gives. \n\nJust make an exotic like Pyrogale that let's us summon a HUGE hammer that embeds into the boss, or a singular huge Twlight Axe that you can pull back and forth 3 times allowing for actually dps AND weaken. This is a bandaid fix, but also I think would make for a fun (and first of its kind) super enhancing exotic not tied to a single element/super.\n\nEdit I got this post mixed up with a discussion thread from r/destiny2, whoops. It actually fits here pretty well, but obviously nobody wants to read a wall of text about ideas in a thread about them announcing changes to the same thing I'm currently complaining about in long form haha. Excuse my mini book,id delete but I feel like a lot of ideas here (while not the first to think about these things, especially TA Axes) are good to have in the open just in case anybody is lurking.",

Rally would still have a place for dps reload boosts but other than that I think it'd be lights out barricade for most situations.",

You either need aspects (like drengers Lash or what used to be Bastion) or you kick it off to exotics. \n\nThe reason why thrusters work with the Arc sub class is that it builds into the class fantasy of being active and being the aggressive bunker buster. It makes you want to keep moving forward. Drenger's Lash works for the Berserker class identity because it helps with the idea that you are going to ravage the enemy and who better to do it on when they are completely defenseless. It string them up so that you will go out on them. \n\nThe issue with barricade is that there are no way to give it more use involving your subclass (besides Bastion but that was made worse because of PvP) to increase it usage with abilities. \n\nThere are some other issue with Barricade: most of them are to do with their interactions enemy attacks (sort of works on stomps but doesn't work on explosions that generate on/near the barricade, can stop some beams but also doesn't give a break on tracking behind it). It strange and some of those could probably be resolves without making them completely overpowered.",

Hunter in particular basically none of the grenades are actually remotely good for dealing damage except for Grapple Grenade with Grapple Melee, Titan is barely any better either.\n\nIt REALLY feels like completely different people/teams designed Prismatic Warlock compared to Titan and Hunter.

Waiting 6+ months  for any changes and then the changes always being massive nerfs with very minor rare buffs is just garbage.\n\nBig nerfs WOULD be fine if they actually went back and adjusted things a couple weeks or a month later when they were obviously too heavy handed but they never do that.\n\nThe other problem is just that this philosophy doesn't (imo at least) lead to valuable data. When you nerf every aspect of something into the ground you don't actually get a good idea of what parts were really the issue and what could safely be buffed back up or not.\n\nThe biggest place you see this happen is actually with Exotics and particularly exotic armor. We have super strong exotic armor pieces that will dominate for 6-12 months and then Bungie turns them into absolute trash that nobody ever uses and then MAYBE years later they give them a minor buff or a rework and HOPE that makes people use them. But then if that DOESN'T get people using them they never do anything about it either. REALLY doesn't help that we'll get major sandbox changes for a huge expansion like Final Shape with what is allegedly the biggest exotic armor rework to date and it's like...maybe 10 exotics that get adjusted across the entire game.",

            "I disagree honestly, there is a lot that can be done on the other subs that can\u2019t be done on prismatic right now.\n\nFor one, Child is missing, which already removes a lot from the kit preventing any builds based around it, same with overcharged grenades, as even if they aren\u2019t fantastic they can still be fun to build around.\n\nArc is missing its main two gimmicks imo, in ionic trace spam and in team wide arc soul support for dps boosting. Plus, flux grenade spam\n\nSolar is the big one, missing both its big support abilities as well as its airborne stuff\n\nStrand misses out on its more unique aspects like weavewalk for get of jail free cards. It also doesn\u2019t have the crazy access to suspend that broodweaver can get, nor does it have thread of evolution to make Threadlings just better.\n\nFinally, Shadebinder still has the newly introduced frost armor builds, which after some playing around aren\u2019t all too bad, tho they could def use a buff. Plus, iceflare bolts, my beloved\n\nNow that\u2019s not to say everything is perfect. I really think Arc and Void def need a new aspect to help diversify their kits further, and some of their existing aspects def need a buff. Arc\u2019s supers need some help, and void could use a second melee option.\n\nAlso don\u2019t forget that the individual fragments do add a lot to these builds.",

            "Sunspots and Diamond Lance aren\u2019t elemental verbs, they are things that apply elemental verbs and damage. Volatile itself is an elemental verb and does Void damage.\n\nSunspot and Diamond Lance on Prismatic = Ability kills spawn items upon death.\n\nControlled Demolition on Prismatic = Solar, Strand, Stasis and Arc abilities apply a Void verb, Volatile, upon contact, on top of their own elemental verbs like Scorch, Unravel, Sever, Slow, Freeze and/or Jolt at the same time. \n\nFor example, Facet of Dominance doesn\u2019t cause all grenades to weaken and/or Jolt. It allows only Void grenades to apply weaken and only Arc grenades to apply Jolt. \n\nWarlock summons don\u2019t turn the filter off. Bleak Watcher is a completely separate ability from the rest of the grenades, which is why it doesn\u2019t apply Weaken or Jolt from Facet of Dominance and doesn\u2019t do elemental damage from the grenade used to create it. Bleak Watcher just uses the grenade charge to be created. Getaway Artist only works with Storm grenades because it is the only Arc grenade on Prismatic Warlock. Arc Souls are also completely separate from the regular abilities, they aren\u2019t grenades or melees. Hellion is similar, completely separate from the rest of the abilities and just uses an ability consumption to be created. None of the Warlock summons apply verbs or do damage from other elements. \n\nI don\u2019t think they are going to be adding new aspects to Prismatic beyond the next elemental subclass. Prismatic is already on the verge of making other subclasses redundant, especially with Warlock subclasses. If Prismatic gains Child of the Old Gods, Voidwalker becomes redundant. Stormcaller already is redundant. Broodweaver is redundant. Iceflare Bolts is literally the only thing keeping Shadebinder afloat. Dawnblade is being held up by Well, Ember of Benevolence, Touch of Flame and Solar grenades. Would people use Sentinel if Prismatic Titan had Unbreakable, Controlled Demolition and Twilight Arsenal on top of what the rest of Prismatic has to offer?\n\nThe only way I see more aspects being added is if the other subclasses start getting new aspects to prevent Prismatic from having two thirds of their aspects.",

            ">crystal explosion damage is exactly the same\n\nWhich is why the horde clearing damage was only \"almost\" doubled instead of actually doubled.\n\nThe vast majority of the AoE damage, both then and now, comes from freezing a few enemies and then shattering one of them so that they chain shatter the rest of the enemies in the cluster. Now the shatter damage is enough to break crystals as well along with achieving much better damage breakpoints with smaller groups of targets. Crystals do enough damage to shatter enemies, so if you freeze some ads with a crystal you can get them all to burst each other down by just shooting the crystal.\n\nJust to make sure you have a clear perspective an Ignition's base damage is 750, and it can benefit from whatever damage buffs applied to the source of the first scorch stack so it can often reach 937.5 if you're using Incandescent and Radiant. Shatter easily overtakes this now with groups as small as only two enemies as the crystal has a base damage of 175 and then two 400 base damage enemy shatters adds up to 975, and with Whisper of Fissures adding 25 base damage to every shatter and ad density climbing higher with every new activity it's pretty easy to achieve ridiculous amounts of AoE damage with extremely high uptime because Whisper of Shards brings grenade cooldowns to under 20 seconds at only tier 3 Discipline and Diamond Lances are on an absurdly low cooldown of only 7 seconds.\n\nI honestly don't think engaging with Frost Armor is worth it on Titan though. I think Frost Armor is one of those things that's nice to have for absorbing a bit of chip damage occasionally, but in GMs and master raids I find Whisper of Hedrons in combination with chain shattering everything to be the most consistent way to stay alive.

Arc could be more like a Juggernaut style thing where you block stuff on the move. Solar could be healing and radiating everyone around you with every block.\n\nThe hooks and themes of this are mostly already there in the various Titan subclasses, but they need to be re-jigged and formatted so that they translate into something that functions properly in the sandbox and has a common theme.

Weavewalk is also needed on Broodweaver since it has no defensive ability otherwise, whereas PrismLock has loads (such as CC with Stasis and more direct damage).

Tired of pvp ruining fun stuff in Pve and they've said this rhetoric since D1 a decade ago, except pvp was actually fun back then and balance was still all over the place well into D1.

            "I got a different one for you if you are willing to play extremely aggressive.\n\nThe arc current from ergo sum proc restoration x2 from stronghold. So what you do is take consecration just to proc radiant, the strand one with thruster because you will constantly be in melee so the cc actually lands. Take special finisher because you should be running double special and finisher that proc sever with bladefury. Kinetic slot is usually calling and heavy can be literally anything. I run another heavy sword if I can get away with it, if not just whatever you want.\n\nThis works in the current NF even in masters because is arc heavy. What you do is block for some stacks, heavy attack and then just sword everything to death. Watch your woven mail and arc current and play as needed. You are effectively invincible in ad heavy environment with x2 restoration pretty much on demand, ok coverage on woven mail and 2 cc(shackle/thruster) and thruster comes back very quickly with the facet that give ability energy. Use finisher for ammo and damage reduction.\n\nI will mention this is not a big boss dps set. This is a mostly ad clear and champion killing build. You can sword bosses as you like as long as you know how to block, the damage just won't be impressive. However you can literally run into a group of ads and explode all of them as well as draw fire from enemies while your teammate just shoot safely like a standard stronghold user. I have only tried this so far in expert seasonal activity and master NF but it works surprisingly well.",

I'm not being antagonistic, genuinely, I just think you could say every subclass is about buildcrafting.\n\nConsecration spam is genuinely strong. It might not be exciting, it might not be interesting, but it's not bad. Racing towards Ascendance and alternating between that state and your Super seems to be the current Prismatic Titan thing to do.",
            "Regarding stasis, I can assure you it\u2019s very easy and very good to build around frost armor on warlock. You clearly didn\u2019t really try hard enough. You can either use iceflare bolts with harvest and osmiomancy to freeze entire rooms with just two grenades, while also getting them back in two seconds for the next room, or you can build into frostpulse and turrets with ballidorse and high rift uptime. Plus Ballidorse honestly gives the stasis super a decent use case as a panic button. Lets you ensure your team has more survivability when overrun while also helping to calm things down through room wide freezes. Don't forget, with the fragment, max stacks of frost armor is 36% DR, which stacks with both your resiliance and any other source of DR you have. Plus if you really hate the super, Ager\u2019s exists for just the reason. I ran through master nightfalls the other night with both of these builds, didn\u2019t die a single time, same goes for running through cooperative focus missions.\n\nDon\u2019t sleep on the damage bonus granted by a full team of arc souls, it\u2019s a very noticable dps buff. Plus, arc gives you access to a more reliable ability spam for all your tools, not just grenades, while also giving you access to stronger grenades in general through pulse or flux. Slap on Fallen Sunstar and you got a great support build, as you boost team wide damage with arc souls and return energy to your team with every trace you collect, which also lets you thrrow out endless grenades and boosted ball lightning melees, without even needing to get kills if you run cold heart.\n\nSolar has ember of benevolence as the big one, but also the ability to extend healing timers. Plus touch of flame to massively boost your healing grenade potential, heat rises to have on demand healing as well as a damaging grenade, and touch of flame again to have beefed up fusions or solar grenades. Sunbracers still slap even with their nerf. Not to mention, even with its nerf, well is still a top tier super and ability. Plus the real utility of Heat Rises is truly in its ability to give you a near constant melee uptime to let you keep snapping. Also HR has great interaction with Song of Flame, as consuming your grenade while it\u2019s active gives Cure x3 and Restoration x2 to both you and any nearby guardians.\n\nOn void, yes Chaos Accelerant is in a rough spot and needs some help, but it does have its uses. Scatters are great with it, as are the bigger vortex nades. Plus, with the recent buff, HHSN magnetic grenades actually go really hard. All of these could of course still stand to have the built in damage buff returned. Also CotG\u2019s real utility is easy weakening, constant chip damage, and access to further ability regen, as it can return not just grenade regen on top of your devour, but also constant melee and rift energy, all without needing kills. Plus, you forget that the melee has been buffed with final shape so it\u2019s actually not that bad. It really throws enemies back like a taken phalanx blast now, so it\u2019s good when your surrounded, and its damage was turned way up too.\n\nAlso you criticize MindSpun and Wanderer but both give Broodweaver access to something huge missing on Prismatic: Super, and good suspend at that. That and it\u2019s just much easier to make more threadlings on the sub due to all your aspects making them basically.",

But here's the funni part. Skolas had burns and any weapon that didnt match the burn was damn near useless... until solar week and gjallarhorn shredded the shit out of him. Now your choices were \"wait until solar week to get one of the ciphers orrrr smash your head into a wall trying to use the appropriate arc or void weapons and hope they work fine\" bungie had noticed that and was like \"oh.... this isnt good we gotta fix that...\" and removed it and i believe remedied it by reducing Skolas damage resistance.

            "There are actually many incarnations of this mistake by Bungie. At its core, players do not want to be forced into playing a very specific load out to overcome a contrived problem. Even in D2 2018, before Forsaken, they tried \u201ccurated loadouts\u201d in prestige raid lairs. Everyone hated it. Forced loadouts was a massive criticism of champions upon release, as well. There has always been a cyclical battle with Bungie trying to force people to play with specific guns and those gamers fighting back for more loadout freedom. Recent raid surges just tipped the scales too far in one direction of that constant struggle.",

That arguement makes no sense, surges shift the meta and make other options that might be second, or third rate suddenly great. Between Pantheon & SE, surges have had me dusting off more random stuff in my vault in a few weeks than I have in years.\n\nPeople hate surges because they don't like leaving their comfort zone, they want to use the same 5-6 guns they always use. I don't care either way, but the way people have been critisizing surges has been extremely dishonest.",

Everyone sits and complains about being \"forced\" to use other stuff, but then anything that isn't absolute best in slot dps is automatically dismissed as trash. Then everyone complains about all the weapons suck or there is nothing new to chase.\n\nBungie has tried time and time and time again to encourage loadout variety, and everyone just whines unless its blatant power creep.

Same goes for subclasses but to an even more extreme extent. \n\nWhen the changes go live and everything is brought up to surge power, the only thing stopping you from bringing out your Crux Termination instead of Apex Predator is you.

They\u2019ve never quite captured it in D2",
            "Incoming damage was also ridiculously strong too. I managed to beat Skolas on all three burns, but Solar was definitely the easiest if you had 3 G-Horns. \n\nThose were rough days. Many failed runs. But also very satisfying to finally beat it.",

            "My first ever nightfall, when I was awfully under level and being carried, was Omnigul with an Arc burn.\n\nIt was legitimately terrifying. I'm still not over it, 9 years later \ud83d\ude05",
            "I miss the classic riflegaming intro and old school armor piercing rounds that went through walls",
            "Considering how easy and frankly just kinda boring the PVE content of ~~Strikes~~ Vanguard Ops is nowadays, I have literally zero idea why they even put modifiers on it in the first place.\n\nBut, since they DO put modifiers on it, why the fuck not put something more absurd and powerful like the old Burns?!",
            "if i remember Void was 100% the worst one for me. \n\n  \nArc wasn't too bad we just bubbled him and shredded him with found verdict.",
            "I think i only cleared it on solar and it was still a pan in my fucking anus",
            "We all hid behind the crates...",
            "It's still a bad system for normal mode. A player shouldn't need to three different swords with relentless/Whirlwind where the only difference between them is the flavor of syrup the blade was dipped in.",
            "Oh yeah by a mile. I remember when d2 came out i noted how fucking oddly slow it felt, pve and pvp just felt really slow and methodical while d1 was very \"you blitz through things but things will blitz through *you*\"",
            "Interesting. I thought it was you deal 50% and take 50% more from that element. And yeah, I'm a rare soul who got gally off a purple engram back on day 3 or 4 or d1 vanilla launch. Getting that allowed me to solo nightfall off the top even being underleveled. Solar burn weeks were godly lol",
            "I fucking hated blackout that i do remember, minding my own business and getting fucking rocked by a single thrall slap",

            "Just fyi, the raid sword looks like it\u2019ll be a pretty good damage option.",
            "You kinda contradicted yourself lol\n\nBalancing WOULD change that; running the easiest loadouts literally makes sense, most people aren\u2019t going to want to use more complicated setups when they can just press one button. Making other options stronger would go a long way (also tbh I see way more people on Prismatic Warlock running the exotic class item, Mataidoxia, Sunbracers, Speaker\u2019s Sight, and Contraverse Holds than I do Getaway Artist, so I fail to see your point there)",
            "Burns were nerfed in Taken King to be just 25% or something. Much less than the year 1 300% burns.",
            "Okay? Once again, my point still stands. This is the second time they've tried to incorporate surge/burn/singe into something and they did it in a piss poor way and managed to upset alot of people lmao. Call it apples and oranges all you want it's still the same",
            "idk, sounds like maybe the problem is all the still hunt hunters",
            "This isn't a group of friends. it's the multiple lfg groups I've been in. This isnt a tiny circle of friends this is quite literally a few groups ive joined at the witness. \"Do you have a hunter with still hunt?\" Is the first thing that was asked like 3 times. \n\nTalk about assumptions lmao",
            "No, they removed the burns from skolas after 1 cycle i believe. The april update just introduced challenge of the elders",

            "Charizard & Blastoise lol\n\nThe worst was when it was when Solar Burn and Grounded were both on. Charizard would just do his leaping attack and insta kill you. I remember the cheese strat was just to have someone sit high up in a corner where neither brother could hit you and have them stay alive to avoid a team wipe.",
            "my god that strike was so brutal with solar burn lol. it also didn\u2019t help that with d1 fov it was so hard to follow those stupid jumping fucks around.",

            "That strike must be coming back in the Heresy season since we are going back to the dreadnaught. Can\u2019t wait - that was my all time favorite strike in destiny.",

            "Well year 1 d2 was super slow. Double primaries for a full year is single handedly the worst decision in all destiny history. It nearly killed the game, player counts by the end of year 1 were so pathetic and id argue it was largely due to the awful feel of forced double primary.",
            "*laughs in Arc Hunter with Don't Touch Me*",

Never nerf anything, because people will whine. Never increase the difficulty, because people will whine. Just let the power creep set in until everything is meaningless.",
            "your point doesn't stand if it's dishonest lmao\n\nthe fact surges are so neutered compared to how burns were shows that they *have* learned from the past by changing how the modifiers worked",

One build or weapon or class that the lemmings on lfg say you HAVE TO run, until the next cool things comes along. When I read 'hunter still hunt' I read it as a shorthand for 'thanks for the heads up, I dont want to group with you'.",

            "I swear on the traveler they need to make another strike boss chase you like crazy.",

            "Like it or hate it, that\u2019s pretty much all you can do when we get new options every few months. And when I\u2019m saying buff things, I\u2019m talking about stuff that\u2019s WEAK. Stuff that was meta like two, three months ago? You can still use that shit just fine and no one will care; I\u2019m not saying bring back the metas we just had; make the stuff that is LITERALLY UNDERPERFORMING, be good. This extends not just to legendary/exotic weapons, but abilities and supers too. Like, a LARGE amount of class specific exotics are practically worthless at worst, outclassed by other options at best. As for nerfs, dunno why you said that as if it\u2019s crazy people dislike nerfs; yeah people are gonna complain if their shiny new toy no longer is enjoyable to use in the way they used it previously, regardless of it that nerf was warranted (you can\u2019t tell me the nerfs Void Titan got overall was GOOD for that kit compared to how Void Titan was in Witch Queen lol)",
            "I don't know what to tell you, homie. It works, and it works GOOD, but it's happening again, and bungies' only choices were to nerf still hunt so it isnt as needed or remove the burns.",

            "What about the new strike?",
            "I don't even care if we have to reuse the pyramid nightmare shit (that is alluded to being an untapped source of power in the post campaign of TFS) to get a reskinned or reissue of this strike.",
            "But... Alak-Hul has been given the Light now, so it would be a massive cognitive dissonance for anyone who isn't a D1 vet...",
            "Until it was arc burn and you got sniped by a sniper shank as it came down from the ceiling as you were trying to avoid the ogre.",
            "I loved Wretched Eye, it was miserable dealing with everything in the boss room and that made it exciting to fail and even more exciting to succeed",

            "I think you replied to the wrong guy cause they're still talking about shield brothers",
            "I mean there is a difference between having a hearty jaunt through a raid with the homies and then there is lfg hell of \"we just want to get this done please god take off the goofy shit\" and i respect both however, you are expected to dps check especially at the end of the witnesses health bar. If you do not kill him in that final stand you wipe and if anyone spots some goofy shit, it becomes a zero tolerance because \"that could have been the run had you not run stupid shit\"",
            "Probably... This stuff can get screwy on Old Reddit on a phone.",
            "Some of us having been hearing the same old rubbish for ten years. Everything that is not a 'meta/trend/peer-group-pressure' is not immediately 'goofy shit'. There is a world of dps things between those two extremes."
