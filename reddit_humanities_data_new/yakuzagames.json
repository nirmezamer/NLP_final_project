Eric is also odd, for someone who grew up in America he sure does sound like a Japanese person who learned English as an adult. \n\nPlus Danny Trejo not voicing Danny Trejo is just incredibly weird. I feel like Sega Japan and America should have combined their work and had the English dub voices for when people speak English, like they did with that Kson girl, or otherwise cast English actors who could realistically sound like the Japanese ones to switch between. \n\nOr hell, just pull a Tekken and have everyone speak their native language and somehow everyone knows what everyone else is saying.",

            "Finished the game yesterday morning, really enjoyed it and I thought the story was overall pretty good. Wanted to sit on it for a day to sift through some of my feelings on it.\n\nSpoilers for detailed thoughts >!I only have two complaints, one being that I wish we had gotten one more Eiji scene between the club stuff and the ending. Honestly I don't even mind that we didn't get a scene where he feels bad; we just needed to know that was him and what happened to him after the stuff at the club. Something like how he got the boot for losing control of Tatara Channel, anything along those lines. Also I really did not the monologue before Bryce's fight, felt way too long and convoluted for things we already know outside of the mafia connection. We've already seen how evil he can be, I think it would have been interesting to see Ichi raring to fight him ASAP. I did like Ebina as a villain though, I felt that his motivation + the reason Kiryu wanted to fight him was good enough for me to accept him as a final boss.!<\n\nAlso one thing I did like that a lot of people didn't (spoiler again) >!I didn't mind that Kiryu and Haruka didn't reunite on-screen, I think it fit well with the final life link where she feels that it isn't able to handle seeing him again. Nice bit of character growth from her end along with Kiryu being able to reclaim his identity. I wish RGG made that one + the Akiyama a mandatory substory instead of avoidable side content that I have to grind for, I think it would have helped that plot thread a bit and avoided the pace being killed for me during Chapter 12.!<\n\nAnd one last piece of praise that hit my brain while writing this >!Yamai might be one of my new favorite characters in the franchise, his end scene was amazing and in general it might be one of my favorite scenes in a Yakuza game. It helps that he got a lot of screen time, but I appreciated that his plot beats were unexpected at times while still managing to feel appropriate for his character. I'm also glad that they're starting to steer away from always killing antagonistic characters off if they've done a bad thing, like Yamai (and to a lesser extent someone like Shishido in Gaiden). Hope he shows up in LAD9 as a playable character.!<",

LAD is a soft reboot and an onboarding ramp for new players, yet its direct sequel sidelines the LAD cast for huge portions to go on long nostalgia trips with the old protagonist instead which'll mean nothing to anyone who hasn't been here from the beginning.

Everything Palekana was far too goofy and detached, we spend half the game in a wild goose chase after some woman who later gets ignored. Also, it's pretty evident this was developed before and alongside Gaiden; there are barely any connections between both games, and those that are actually there are seriously undercooked.  \nThe combat is superb, a massive improvement over 7 and a delight to experiment with. Music was, as usually with this series, extraordinary. Hawaii felt too large at first but ended up being very cozy and fun to explore. Minigames were a pleasant surprise (I hated Dondoko at first, but I ended up completing it in one go because I just couldn't drop it).",

So many moments that would not mean anything if you don't.",
            "Now that I finished the last chapter I got to say the ending was kind of... underwhelming. Especially compared to  Yakuza 7's ending, which was incredible. >!I know Ichiban's deal is that he is a forgiving person and yakuza jesus but honestly \"Ei-chan\" was willing to murder a 10 year old child, his last relevant cutscene had him all but laughing maniacally about how he'd transform ex-yakuza into slaves worked to the death, and... he just decides to atone? And trust Ichi again? Out of nowhere?!<\n\n>!And before that Bryce was like \"you guys are stupid, putting a video up on the internet won't change shit, I have the police in my pocket and many infiltrated zealots on the government plus international backing\", and they... put a video online, and send him to the police. Like, Bryce is right, they exposed the nuclear waste scam he was running, but long term he is still like the most influential person in Hawaii' underworld, and probably overworld as well if he has as many zealots in the police force and politicians as the game implies. Chitose's father cancelling him on youtube in japan won't do shit to get him a sentence in the states. Yet the game acts like this was a victory, somehow? Like, even in-universe they point out the reasons this shouldn't be a victory, yet it still is one?!<\n\n>!Also, the Kiryu death fakeout. Every game since 5 has a variation of \"Kiryu's story is reaching it's end\", yet they staunchly refuse to let the character go. If you're going to make his entire gameplay portion be about him remembering his past, and make a plot point that he's dying, and etc, only to then turn around and say j/k, it gets to a point where I just got emotionally detached. I'm sure that the next game they will try to pull it again, and probably the one after it too.!<\n\nBut the weirdest part of the endings for the Kiryu group and the Ichiban is that I feel they were kind of... switched around? >!Like, Ichiban had a much personal attachment Ebina, being a blood relative who is presented as a mirror version of him that is evil, while Kiryu had a much more personal drive to go after Bryce, because Lani being on the run reminded him of Haruka being on the run. And yet it's Ichiban who fights Bryce and Kiryu who fights Ebina. Ebina even makes a \"we aren't so different you an I\" speech about Ichiban, but Ichiban isn't even there so he has to go \"hey Kiryu me and Ichiban aren't so different\".!<\n\nAlso while I like how zany the series can get, I think the >!giant shark and giant squid that can swallow party members who then have to fight inside it's stomach are getting a bit -too- zany. Especially for a thing that is part of the main plot and not a side-story!<\n\n>!(Also am I correct in assuming Wong was going to be a playable character they cut out? He just emanates party member energy)!<",

It felt like none of them were just goofy for the sake of being goofy, they *all* went back to some deeper, more emotional reason for why NPC #43 was doing what they were doing.\n\nThat one bit of piano that played *constantly* in the game lost its effect for me. I love the Yakuza series for being a balance of gritty crime drama and goofy, light hearted misadventures. But this one just kind of missed the mark for me.\n\nAlso, that one sub story where >!the Alo Happy lady full on SAs Kasuga!< and it\u2019s done for laughs. Can we stop with this shit man??

And the \"native Hawaiians\" can't speak English worth a crap...\n\nIdk, I'm still enjoying the game. But pulls me out and doesn't feel well done so far.

One of their primary functions (besides convenient travel to and from Hawaii) is forcing Kiryu to remain anonymous and away from his family. Date speaks for the audience when he urges Kiryu to ignore these bastards and finish his bucket list. It's doubly frustrating after the >!Tatara Channel reveals that Kiryu is alive: what the hell is the point of their contract anymore?!< \n\nAnd then they're just... gone? Kiryu gets an >!off-screen reunion with Haruka anyway?!< Then what was the point!?\n\nThe whole game's story is a mess. Half of it was a tutorial, the plot picks up at the end of Chapter 6, and it immediately falls apart once the party is split between Hawaii and Japan.

            "Finished the game earlier today. Gameplay wise it's a big step up from 7. Hawaii was a joy to explore and had some of the best sub stories and mini games in the series.\n\nHowever, story wise, pacing and characters, I think it's one of the weakest this series has ever been. I really struggled through sections of this game without skipping parts. Plus, there's simple things like not front loading 90% of the sub stories in the first few chapters and not making it possible to complete the final dungeon 1/3 of the way into an already easy game.\n\n>! I think Kiryu should be removed as a playable after he gets sent home from Hawaii. The second he becomes a dual protagonist the narrative gets even more messy and unfocused and he can actually pass the torch to Ichiban. Plus a lot of his content feels like Kasuga should be there: everything with Ebina and Sawashiro. Defeat Bryce maybe 2/3rd of the way through the game, but find out that no only does Ebina know what's been going on, but doesn't care. This would also give you a chance to interact with Ei chan more. Since apparently we care oh so much, but the dude had more screen time as a kidnapping blackmailer than anything else. It wouldn't fix all the issues with the narrative, but could help keep things focused. Kiryu can protect Akane or something while in Yokohama, so he's not out of the story and serving a purpose. But is actually suffering from cancer. !<",
            "Man, it's still yakuza, but what a letdown after 7. As always RGG struggles with following up on \"original\" entries (Judgment -> LJ, Y1->Y2, Y4 to Y5 ), but this has been the largest downgrade so far. Story is way less cohesive and focused. Minigames are not as engaging (I know people loved dondoko island, but it felt like a huge chore to me). Substories copy way too much from Y7 too. Maybe it's because RGG had to make a huge new location. Maybe it's because they released 3 games in a span of a year. But Y8 just feels undercooked, or rather hastly cooked. And it's such a shame too, cause gameplay is amazing and the last 3rd of the game has some of the coolest moments in the series. But the staples you expect out of rgg are just so meh this time round.",
            "So I beat the game and wow, is this game a weird one in the grand scheme of Yakuza games.\n\nIt honestly reminds me a lot of 5, which is one of my least favorites tbh. \n\nLike 5, man is the gameplay much improved. They made so many improvements that I wanted like job diversification because now you get to choose which skills carry over, more jobs, way more clarity in battles so you can actually plan better AOE attacks, the movement ring allows you to actually position (which helps the last point) and makes using weapons in combat an actual thing instead of how much it barely comes to play in 7 despite being there.\n\nHowever, like 5, I don't like this game's story much. Most Yakuza games have acts, where maybe the protag's initial goal is small, and then more gets revealed and you realize the conspiracy is deep. In 7, Ichi's first goal is to find Arakawa, but he needs to get information, he's wandering around Yokohama tackling smaller issues until the grand scheme is revealed around Masumi, which is great build-up. In 8, everything sorta gets revealed immediately. You spend 95% of the game looking for Akane and when you have her, I guess you learn that Ebina is bad? (which was obvious), and that Lani was the actual goal of the antagonist? I like the concept of the villain being essentially a cult leader, that's cool, but Bryce isn't very standout.\n\nAlso that whole sub-plot with Ebina being Ichiban's half brother? That's something that should hit, but it really doesn't. Us not getting a Kiryu and the kids reuniting scene? Come on! Sure, I get that they didn't need to shove it in our face, the send-off spoke words in a short scene, but I think we all were looking forward to finally seeing him re-uinte with everyone, but nope.\n\nAt least some of the new characters were great. Tomizawa deserves more love, he's one of my favorite characters already. Yamai was pretty sick, and his character moment was really strong it almost felt like he was going to join the party. Chitose was... idk man. I know it's in Ichiban's character, but the trust they gave her so fast was insane, especially when it's revealed that she is part of the reason things go to shit immediately. I'm surprised they brought back every party member from 7 (except Eri, who was a contest winner). Joongi Han arriving so late was lol.\n\nAlso weird side-note, but **anyone feel like the music is lacking in this one too?** I haven't seen it brought up yet, but the games usually have bangers, but this one there's maybe like 3 okay tracks and the rest is meh (Except the new karaoke songs, all of those are fire).\n\nAlso why did Ebina have a back tattoo? He hates the Yakuza. Shouldn't it be in his design to refuse a back tattoo?",
            "Question to those who had finished the game.. What did you think?  Major spoilers for the ending ahead so continue at your own risk:>!I'm asking because personally I felt a bit of a let down from the ending. As if the story of Kiryu should have come a full circle but it only went like.. 80%? I had imagined him returning to Okinawa to live the rest of his days there with the kids (obviously not kids anymore). I don't mind him seeking treatment but it almost felt.. rushed? I know the game was long but tbh, it felt like a lot of plot points were dropped by the end. What happened to Akane? Lani? The aftermath of Ei-Chan and Yamai. Bryce and Ebina. I know that they went to jail but Ebina and Bryce talked about the \"repercussions of messing up their plans to the governments of the world\", but we don't really see that. I'm not looking for a political espionage game or whatever, but I would have at least loved to know what the response of Japan was to the whole ordeal. And of course, Chitose. They say she went on to become the CEO of the Fujinomiya Corporation, but SHOW ME! I wanna know how my girl is doing! I felt like there was no resolutions. For a game filled with a bunch of exposition, by the end they really went for the \"tell don't show\" method, and that really grinds my gears. I know this comment is all over the place, but I couldn't find a better place to rant. Also, to anyone who objects to my views, I would love to discuss them further. Maybe someone will enlighten me to something I had missed.!<",

I don't just mean 'twists' - there were a couple but I felt like all of them were easy to see from a million miles away. More like it just failed to deliver on anything in a significant matter - I enjoyed the game but I didn't wind up having a strong reaction to any single plot point or event. The ending wasn't bad or unresolved - just simple and straight forward.\n\nIt reminds me slightly of a JJ Abrams plot - it keeps acting like there's some sort of question or intrigue that you want to stick around for but by the time you arrive at the point you realize that it's all smoke and mirrors.",

It hurts but I know she\u2019s in a better place. Seeing how much Kiryu and the gang care about cats makes me feel good to post this here. I feel like Ichiban at the end of the game, carrying my family through the grieving process. They\u2019ve done it so much for me in the past that I felt like this game was speaking to me directly when the gang told Kiryu to lean on his friends more. \n\nTake care guys.

Big praise coming from someone who was very frustrated with 7's combat upto late game.\n\n+  So. Many. Minigames.\n\n+ Dondoko island. That's it that deserves it's own point.\n\n+ Skill Inheritance is here to stay I hope and I hope they allow us to bring in the special essence moves of other jobs in future games.\n\n+ Amazing substories maybe top 2 in the franchise.\n\n+ I had felt maybe Yokoyama set himself up by hyping him Yamai but he exceeded all expectations I really hope this is a recurring character in the future tho I don't believe he will be a party member anytime soon.\n\nTHE BAD\n\n- Hoo boy, here we go this game's story from chapter 9 or 10 onward is like a fever dream. Constantly squanders it's own potential by presenting good ideas with terrible execution perhaps more so than any other game in the series. Let's further break this down ->\n\n    \u2022 >! Akane WTF. I didn't mind the goose chase for over half    the game for this character as much as most people did but the payoff was underwhelming to say the least. She just walks up no fanfare and for most of the rest of the game you'd have trouble to convince me this is the long lost mother of the MC with how little she has to do in the story in a active capacity.!<\n\n    \u2022 >! Lani WTF. Who is this girl? Like seriously I know jack about her besides her grandma died and she's the sage. She must have like 5 lines i could count on one hand and that's it. I thought after Judgement series and LAD we were past the bad female character syndrome in this series but here comes the queen step aside Yasuko, Yumi, Mayumi and Kiyomi I guess the good female writers went on holiday to Hawai.!<\n\n    \u2022>! Palekana the cult was actually not so bad as people are saying I mean sure it's a cult so it has all those stereotypes but they're not executed badly. That said, Bryce Fairchild what a man you are, perhaps someone to surpass Terada. I could not take this man seriously for one second and his boss fight was the worst boss fight bar none in the whole franchise no gimmick it's just he has guns. At least Jingu and Munakata were slippery bastards with guns this man has no game.!<\n\n    \u2022 >! Chitose. Okay this is one character I hope we never see again as a party member at least. It straight up felt sickening to control her (I had to cz kunoichi is that good) after she got Hanawa killed and got no pushback from any of the cast like Ichiban okay kinda stretching believability here but I get you're silly like that but what's up Tomi?! Didn't you call this happening earlier?! Why're you cool with this?! Then she admittedly does the right thing and exposes herself as Tatara (don't get me started on that voice) and brings down Palekana, her own family and even herself WAIT she gets promoted to chairwoman so she faces no legal consequences at all?! she is literally admitting to spreading defamation for years against the world's elites and she gets off Scott free...!<\n\n    \u2022 >! Eiji Mitamura- Before anything, how did this man go from Hawaii to Japan after giving Lani to Dwight then sail all the way from Japan to Hawai in a cruise (news anchor confirms this) then gets from Hawaii back to Japan and grows a stubble and his hair out within 24 hours?! Cz that's what it feels like what happened cz Kiryu was still on the ruf waiting for pickup. Am I taking crazy pills rgg?! Also for that matter, Kasuga is an asshole I get that he wants to capture Eiji as his pal but Kiryu might be fucking dying did he even visit the hospital once?? Does he care?! I wouldn't know since no one breaths his name after he finishes off Ebina!<\n\n>!Also this is the moment Ichiban's positivity went from endearing to offendingly stupid this is not a mirror to his bond with Masato. This is as if he went up and forgave Kume for everything he did and never raised his hand against him all because he believed Kume was feeling bad after killing Masato after a couple days and they had some fun in one chapter so they're pals.!<\n\nHonestly this should have been a Kiryu game with Ichiban as a supporting character in his party with >!Ebina as the overarching villain across both Japan and Honolulu. Everytime Ebina was on screen I was engaged yeah his backstory is nothing special and his motivation is predictable but this stereotype works for a reason and it was effective and I also appreciated Kiryu pulling an Ichiban and apologising to Ebina to atone instead of knocking him out. That said god dammit not another cliffhanger what's the point of this just let Kiryu have his heartwarming reunion with Haruka it is the number one reason I got the game...!<\n\nSidenote- >!

It takes a ammout of glass to build the urinal, but if you select an ammount to build that would make the glass on your inventory to go exactly to 0, you get the urinal built and the building experience but the glass count doesn't go down. Meaning, if you have 20 glass, and use exactly 20 glass to build urinals, you'd get the urinals and keep the 20 glass, but if you use 19 glass the count goes down to 1 as intended. I'm guessing there's a bug in the code we're for some reason the number of glass you have can't be zero or something.\n\n\nThe second is less funny but one of the healing items you can buy in the Chinese medicine shop says in the description that it \"recovers X HP and heals all status ailments for the party\", but the description is lying to you, it's actually a single person use item.

Yes, they laid on the nostalgia and fan service heavier than maybe any game ever before in service of telling the player that Kiryu is REALLY dying this time, guys! But he's come back from canon injuries enough to kill most at least twice before, with one being the actual perfect off-ramp for the guy.

Plus, he didn't really look all that dandy in the end. Man practically looked his age for the first time in (in universe) decades.

It's not like the idea of \"infinity\" has any sort of thematic relevance either even though they use the symbol for it for the tag attacks.

In many ways this is so far one of most infuriating Yakuza games due to unreal level of hand-holding and infinite expose that just prevent you from playing game. Fact that world really only opens up in Chapter 3 is up with my complains about Saejima in Y5 where it took FOREVER until you finally got to play game in open world and not follow string of scripted events.\n\nOn topic of pacing, I didn't know why I play the game because nothing seemed to be happening up until Chapter 10. There is no real reason why I should care about various mob groups in Hawai as Ichiban is just visitor aside of fact he is trying to find Akame and they been looking for her as well. Kamurocho and IJ seems to both be doing just fine too, no help needed, thank you. Chapter 10 finally gives you stakes but at that point I was playing for everything but story about which I lost any interesting in as developers seemed to have done the same. Not sure where the people who dropped banger like Y7 story went, probably were on vacation in Hawai when storyboard was drafted. With side content that you probably already consumed by Chapter 10 we are talking good 70-80% point in the game by that time, that's not good.\n\nKiryu portion was strongest, but entire Daidoji thing I feel was bad idea, Kiryu on leash of political group that is using his own foster kids as blackmail material (Gaiden) seems rather out of character for him, not to mention they don't seem to do anything but just exist. I understand devs are drawing parallels with Nippon Kaigi (which is hardly shadowy), but I would expect them to do something aside of sitting in house looking important.\n\nLife Links were good, especially seeing some characters we didn't in decades at this point, but wasn't fully aware why can't Kiryu just sit with them now the jin is out of the bottle and at least few characters like Fukoaka chief knew that? Again it draws back to Daidoji who, again, I think are kinda dumb. I don't think RGG will ever bring most of these characters back in any later installment so Kiryu having last heart-to-heart with them would be nice close and feels like missed opportunity.\n\nCombat improved and fun. I didn't care much for Tomi, but Chitose was fun as companion. Old crew from Y7 kept their very high standarts, in case of Seonhee even went up IMO. Yamai is very good new character, hope they keep him around even as companion. He has that nice balance of batshit crazy and honorable that worked wonders for Majima.\n\nOverall, I'd say Y8 after Y5 went off with boast about \"biggest Yakuza\" but where in Y5 it seems they told devs to go crazy and pull in any stuff they can think off, in Y8 they had all this massive emptiness and filled it with slog. Alas disappointing.",
            "It's a big ick for me too that various documents (newspaper and stuff) are in Japanese. The scenes clearly expect you to understand what the documents say but I simply don't. Not that big a deal but it feels like I've missed something, every time.",

Eric is also odd, for someone who grew up in America he sure does sound like a Japanese person who learned English as an adult.\n> \n> \n\nthat was very weird. i figured what they'd do is mix audio tracks. use the english VAs when the character needs to speak english, and the japanese VAs when they don't (as you say).",

            "yes, the combat is *vastly* improved. being able to move around (movement range even expands as you level up!) and use objects for basic attacks made it much more enjoyable than the previous game.",
            ">!Yeah, 7 was hard to top. It had a lot of heart and was close to the chest for Ichiban who came off better in 7 (he comes off a little dumber in 8?). It also closes out Tojo/Omi stuff only for this game to say that it fails one year in. I think 8's story was a little too ambitious and spun its wheels for a bit around ch 6-8 when you're looking for Akane, picks up for a bit, and then ends.!<\n\n>!8's gameplay with 7's story would've been the dream. The job system in this game + positioning yourself optimally + Kiryu's real time combat were great stuff.!<",
            "Honestly the fact that no one important died is surprising, also why couldnt they show the scene of kiryu finally reuniting with haruka, grrr, makes me so angry",
            "i can see why you think that. this game's narrative was *very* ambitious and it might have felt shallow in parts (e.g. the gangs in 7 were very developed, not so much in 8 imo)",
            "I think the 3 key areas where it falters are.\n\n1. Trying to convince us that Ebina is a legitimate threat to the Yakuza despite his whole hatred of them only being revealed only in the last chapter, and really only to the characters at the final boss fight.\n\n2. Palekana. I guess I get what they were going for with the chase sequences. It would've been cool if it was like the Jingweon where they were popping up left and right. But they just disappear after we hide for a little.\n\nAlso no need to say this, but Bryce should've been cooler. Considering that they kept mentioning his age and he controls those giant monsters, I legitimately thought he was gonna be some kind of enhanced human.\n\n3. Lack of emotional depth. Basically only has emotional moments with Eiji, who I feel doesn't warrant it to the same degree as Ryo Aoki, who had been at Ichiban's side for years, and whose nihilism made for a much more interesting arc to contrast with Ichiban, imo. \n\nAlso the fact that Ichiban doesn't seem to give a shit about his biological family. Akane I kinda get, but they should've at least had a few more moments together. In fact, there could've been an interesting dynamic with Akane, the woman who loved Arakawa more than anyone, and Ebina, the man who hated him more than anyone.",

            "Really? How?",
            "My take on that point: This is my second Yakuza game, with my first Yakuza game being the 7th (LAD). I heard the LAD was a \"reboot\" of the series, so I started there with no prior knowledge on the series. I obviously pieced together the big cameos in LAD were from previous games, which obviously had little impact on my emotionally but it didn't detract from the present experience. I finished the first game and rated it my personal favorite game played of 2023.\n\nNow that I finished Infinite wealth, my second Yakuza game, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it through-and-through. When I got to the Kiryu sections, I found myself quite invested in his story, as I was seeing it from the perspective of his party (Nanba, Seeona, etc.). Essentially, characters I am familiar with and understand how they act. I also found the Kiryu chapters to be the most fun from a pure-gameplay standpoint. The game has good systems, and you are encouraged to explore these more with his chapters. While some of the emotional weight was not there for me, I think they did a good job for players who have no background on Kiryu\n\ntl;dr I knew nothing of Kiryu but by the end of the game, I came to love his character and understand his importance in the series. His chapters where also just \"good video games\".",
            "That's very understandable. Even without the Kiryu Memories, I think its the first RGG game besides  Yakuza 2 where I think someone should play the previous title. I don't think its right to say that the writing took a step for shuffling the main cast around to fit the story that IW tells. While the Yokohama castmates definitely take a back seat for the story, The new and returning characters at the forefront do a great job at conveying a lot of the stories' themes. Not to say that they couldn't be done differently with the old guys. I think my issue is that I think this game jumps the shark figuratively and literally for the series as I have no clue what would make Ichiban's next adventure something that would be nearly as original as this one was without just retreading it.",
            "I am very late to the party but I have similar view as you, gameplays, mechanics, QoL, and minigame are huge improve over LAD, but story and character development are disappointing in IW. Not having play any other Yakuza game the \u201cKiryu a trip down memory lane\u201d doesn\u2019t quite pull the emotions for me. Aoki Ryo and Sawashiro are written so much better in LAS.

But I agree, it's not good (okay, I'll admit seeing Gary Buster Holmes appear in Chitose's was pretty funny). The similar substories in Yakuza: Like a Dragon also sucked. Having to grind out generic bonding relationships only to get a weird sexual assault scene played up for laughs *five times* is just bad (made even worse by the follow up story where Ichiban is essentially punished for being assaulted multiple times - by the people who assaulted him in the first place).\n\nIt's especially crap in Infinite Wealth's context because Ichiban confirms multiple times that he's not interested in anyone else because his heart is set on Saeko. I know this argument is brought up every time in these sorts of complaints, but swap the genders of Ichiban and the substory characters and everyone would be rightfully angry.

One small thing is the little callouts they do during battle which unfortunately you don't get subtitles for if you play in Japanese. Eric in particular is pretty funny in English, and I thought the Sujimon were also surprisingly funny in English. Like when you go to capture one of them after a battle and they're out of breath and clearly injured saying \"Y-you wanna go??\" Lol gets me every time.

He couldn't have known in the long-run what taking the fall for Nishiki's crime would've led to, he was just being an above-and-beyond friend.

            "Not exactly the same, as it came out on the more popular PS4 a year later, and also didn't have 5 previous instalments worth of background lore behind it.",
            "So basically a normal Yakuza substory\ud83e\udd23",
            "Clarkson's Farm is also good.  That's about the end of the list. \n\nRings of power, Wheel of Time, etc were pretty crap.  There is a reason you haven't haven't heard of many other ones, because they're forgettable to terrible.",
            "Only thing I think is harder is the jingu fight",
            "So?  It was still a top selling game on the PS3 before that.  Why weren't the early Yakuza games rereleased on the PS4 in 2014 to booming sales?\n\n>also didn't have 5 previous instalments worth of background lore behind it.\n\nWhat does that matter?  Are you trying to jump through hoops where you try to find as many minor differences as possible with everything else that exists so you can ignore any actual comparisons and live in a bubble of denial?",
            "In terms of pure bs difficulty I agree, but even Jingu couldn't stand up to my cheese strategy (an inventory full of healing items and a small armory of strong weapons I won from the coliseum when going for completion) so it ended up being a lot less frustrating for me.",
            "Yeah exactly, a top selling game on the PS3 and yet still only 10th across all platforms when it released in 2013. That just shows how terribly all PS3 exclusives did.\n\nAnd if you can't figure out why a game with 5 games of lore behind the story might not sell as well as the start of a brand-new series then that speaks for itself.\n\nAre you actually 12 years old like your username suggests or do you just sound like one? You haven't made any actual comparisons other than calling them bad.",
            "I always had trouble with jingu even with weapons lol",
            ">Are you actually 12 years old like your username suggests or do you just sound like one?\n\nConsidering this account has been active for almost 12 years that would be pretty impressive.  It was actually about the whole Mayan calendar predicting the end of the world in Dec 2012 which I thought was hilarious at the time.\n\n>And if you can't figure out why a game with 5 games of lore behind the story might not sell as well as the start of a brand-new series then that speaks for itself.\n\nPlease clarify then.  From what I can see we are inundated with remakes and sequels since they generally sell much better and are seen as far safer investments by studios compared to brand new franchises.  Should I expect GTA6 sales to be weak since it's got a bunch of games behind it?"
