            ">What I dont understand is people thinking that he's faking his accent, which makes no sense at all \n\nProbably because people (maybe one of the chess bras) that have interacted with him said he doesn't have it in person and puts it on for the camera combined with it seemingly appearing overnight.\n\n>Literally why would he do that?\n\nIt's not uncommon for Americans do it when they want to sound worldly. Especially those wanting to be the center of attention. Have you never heard someone could back from a semester abroad with a fake accent?",

            "4, what about you? Do you understand what an accent is? Do you understand why so many non native English speakers struggle so much to learn the language compared to other languages? English pronunciations and accents are incredibly diverse and there are more accents in the US alone than you would find across any other country in the world.",
            "You must not talk to very many different people then, or you\u2019re basing that off of the he news, and the way people talk on TV isn\u2019t the same way people talk in real life across the country.\n\nThe way people sound in Chicago is different from anywhere around them. You can travel any direction 4-6 hours around Chicago and there are a variety of different distinct accents in every direction. The way people sound in Chicago, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, central Illinois, and southern Illinois are all different and all unique accents. Even within the unique American accents you have breakdowns, someone from Tennessee and someone from Sourhern Texas sound dramatically different even if they both have \u201csourhern\u201d accents.",
            "Lmao fair enough",
            "there's barely a difference from how he always talks, you guys are mega exaggerating",
            "Yeah but was it in your adolescence?",

            "could also argue that the chessbrahs only say that about him cuz they are trying to be the center of attention. people will latch onto anyhting unique about a person to bring them down. at least he's not a cookie cutter gen z'er that starts every sentence with the word \"literally\"",
            "And he\u2019s cuter than Naka \ud83d\ude09 and he\u2019s packing more than Naka \ud83d\ude09 and he just has such a nice body \ud83d\ude09 should I add anymore for you?",
