        "content": "  \n\nSo, you want to be a fucking successful adult. CONGRATS, I have written some how-to\u2019s for you so you can start to get your fucking shit together. \n\n[Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/bgzqbc/how_to_be_a_motherfucking_successful_ass_adult/)\n\n[Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/bh0m1l/being_a_motherfucking_successful_ass_adult_part/)\n\n[Part Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/bh3evn/how_to_be_a_motherfucking_successful_ass_adult/)\n\n[Adulting with Depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/bh4lzh/how_to_adult_when_you_are_too_depressed_to/)\n\nHere are some fucking FAQ\u2019s on the parts I wrote so that you don\u2019t have to scroll through and upvote every single nice comment in the comment section on all of the parts. \n\nQ: Are there going to be more parts?\n\nA: Yeah probably. But I have a fucking life where I do things that aren\u2019t writing how-to\u2019s, so they will arrive whenever I am feeling generous enough to give advice and have the energy to write about said advice. \n\nQ: You should write a book.\n\nA: Thank you, I am. The book is in the works, basically it\u2019s a fucking 100-page rant where I talk about how to wash your balls. \n\nQ: How old are you? Are you a boy or a girl?\n\nA: I am an adult. I will not tell you my age because once I do you will suddenly have all these pre-conceived judgements about the quality of the advice I give. But here is a hint, I am older than 18 and younger than 50. I am a person. Take a guess on my gender and if you get it right Ill give you a fucking star. \n\nQ: Why can\u2019t you write normally?\n\nA: Because there are a bajillion fucking self-help books out there written normally, and there are like 5 that are written in a way that people fucking relate to and listen to. If cursing *turns you off* then good. I only want readers who can fucking read this shit with a boner 6 miles long. \n\nQ: I have a tip that you don\u2019t mention, can you add it to the article?\n\nA: Sure, if its actually fucking good. Send me a message with your advice that you think is good enough to make it, and I\u2019ll add it to the end of the article and credit you. \n\nQ: I run a podcast/YouTube channel/ blog, can I interview you or have you guest speak?\n\nA: Generally, yes. My time is precious, so if you want me to write something completely new for your shit its going to take a while and will probably cost you more than exposure. \n\nQ: What do you do when you aren\u2019t cussing people out on the internet?\n\nA: I own a business and am a stay at home parent. When I am not writing, I am packing orders, creating or listing new product, taking care of my son, or playing with my two dogs. I rarely have any down time.\n\nIf you have more questions you want answered or have an idea for an article you want me to write, send me a PM. I will decide if its cool enough for me to respond to it.",

There it seems some people have this blockage in their train of thought that we all need to be self sufficient and so does our mental health but the sheer fact of being able to accept outside help and knowng that you need it is a big part of helping yourself too. \n\nI feel for all those who can't get past themselve and see no future and I too have been there and its deep and dark and sometimes you may think you are out of there but certain situations can trigger the same emotions to come rolling back in an instant. \n\nOf course you could be upset, buy or obtain new stuff, and feel more complete in itself.

You might be looking at yourself there \"bruh\" as you youngsters say, you might want to pay attention to that. I don't know if repetitive swearing is cringe or not, I don't mind as long as there's a rhythm to it. Catching your neighbor banging his wife at 2:00 am on their kids backyard trampoline isn't cringe. Trying to hit on her the next time you see her alone back there is. Good sub..",

I actually wrote down some goals and a 5 year plan and I mailed them out to strangers and non profits so they could tell if I was on track and just to kind of get help from an outside source. I tried like 7 different medications until I found 2 that work for me. I called or emailed basically everyone I know and attempted to explain what I was going through and found compared to everything else I was doing they paid the least attention. And found I was expecting happiness from the wrong places.",

If you're written an article about how to be an adult, you don't use a headline that makes you sound like a total douchebag. Why you may ask? Well for people that are not total douchebags, they're not going to be interested in pursuing an article with a headline that reads as if it written by an apparent douchebag.\n\nPicture yourself thumbing through a magazine and you see an ad for designer jeans. Do they have an ugly person for a model? No they don't. Why is that you may ask? It's because people don't stop and look at ugly people. In the same way. People don't stop for ugly headlines.\n\nAnother take on this: You're shopping for a new car. Do you stop and look at a Yugo? No, not because they haven't been made since the 80s. You don't stop because they are ugly cars. Unless of course you're ugly, in which case you bond with the Yugo, and possibly start a new family. Picture baby Yugo Matchbox cars running around the house.\n\nYou're wheeling around your infant four wheeled wonder, and the neighbor stops to admire. One look at that abomination, I mean you delightful baby Yugo, and your neighbor punches you in the nose for bringing such a hideous beast into the world. Cursing you that such beasts only belong in the book of revelations.\n\nHearing such words makes you want to offer the lovely Christian a Bud Light and a rainbow flag, uttering the words \"Taste the rainbow.\" He glances at your crotch with its Ken doll smoothness and says \"Those aren't Skittles, they're barely Chiclets.\" Little do you know after church your neighbor cruises the \"gay\" strip, but only to make sinners repent. Don't, please don't, tell your neighbor that get spit roasted by two dudes isn't called repenting.\n\nDoes this let the air out of your tires? Turn your coupe into a cabriolet? Of course it does, but you have only yourself to blame. After all, you could have dated that lovely Porsche that was eying you up at the county fair. Instead you went for the low hanging fruit. If you're at a retirement home, watch out for the low hanging fruit. You quickly find that one man's low hanging fruit is his sagging ball sack.\n\nNow, isn't it perfectly clear what I am talking about?",

My parents basically managed to have me think the world was perfect until I was like 15. \n\nI personally wouldn't say the world is cruel though. I think it's just uncaring. The world isn't going to help that starving child, that's something we need to do.",

It\u2019s sad that we would rather tell people to get over themselves than just be kind. Why people give up so easily and choose to contribute to the negativity in the world is beyond me. It\u2019s so easy to be kind. Now we\u2019ve stooped to the level of those miserable people who make our days worse and we\u2019ve become miserable ourselves. \n\nIt\u2019s sad seeing once pure hearted kids turn out to be bullies. It\u2019s sad seeing people so messed up by the world that it drives them to commit crimes or suicide or just physically and mentally abuse others.\n\nYes the world is terrible, we live in a messed up society and have barely any control over our lives, it\u2019s all based on luck. But having a bad day doesn\u2019t mean you should make everyone have a bad day. It just really upsets me how people can be so heartless these days and go about their day knowing that they caused someone else pain. \n\nAll of the terrible things happening in this world have to do with us. We started it all. Human beings. Because somewhere along the way we lost our humanity and our ability to have a heart for people, if we even had those things in the first place. \n\nLife is such a scary thing, but the part that makes it cruel to me is how soulless, lifeless and heartless humans have become.",

If something needs taken care of immediately then you have to do what you have to do, but otherwise it\u2019s not a huge deal and can be taken care of when convenient/it makes sense.

I grew up in tough times being in poverty with divorced parents, having my elementary school judge me harshly bc of my parents divorce and their heavy Catholic beliefs, and then as I grew I watched the world have more and more crazy historical events and watched prices get higher and I got taken advantage of so many times now...\n\nI try really hard to do good and to make those around me happy, but it takes a toll and people aren't all kind. I feel tired all the time, I feel hopeless quite a bit, I'm not lucky in love or finances, and my mental health has taken a hit, but I somehow still keep pushing myself along. \n\nAs I get older though...it just keeps getting tougher. I'm in therapy, but even then it's just learning a lot of coping mechanisms and trying to desensitize myself to all of the trauma.",

All of us.",

It's important to show kindness and empathy towards others, even if it's just a simple question about their day.",

            "You were listening into my therapy session a couple weeks ago?\n\nBeing serious tho, yes, sometimes. I think a lot about inequality and people who are just trying to live their lives and raise families often getting caught in cross fire of war or persecuted directly. I think of how easy it could be to feed everyone if we wanted to. How we come so far - the human race - and yet we cling to old ideas that keep certain people down in social structures and opportunities.\n\n\nOn a personal level, I\u2019ve been hurt more than once recently very deeply and I can\u2019t really stop thinking about it. I try to be kind to people and be the person I\u2019d want as a friend and yet have experienced, more than once, being treated poorly or had biases expressed against me (I am a minority). \n\nOne was very intentional and it started breaking me. I got very angry, more than I ever felt recently. Like I wanted to break things and scream. But I just kinda kept it bottled in. \n\n\nI told my therapist I don\u2019t want to be a hateful person, but it is hard right now. It\u2019s hard not to match the energy and I ended up kinda just crying without meaning to. A lot of people are cruel. And a lot of people don\u2019t care. And that clashes directly with my belief/hope that most people want to be good. :(",

            "The world sucks ass. So much anger, hatred and pain. Everyone hates anyone who thinks differently from them. People look down on the broken and treat them like shit. So I do my best to be welcoming and open minded. I know the world is cruel, so I like to express my love to my friends. I feel someone should help shoulder the weight, so even if the weight of the world is too much to bear, I will gladly take a little off of someone else.

It\u2019s kinda weird because sometimes you\u2019d expect the world to put you down, but from my own experience, I find that it\u2019s the people around me that\u2019s pushing me to reach my potential. Sometimes it\u2019s me who doesn\u2019t see so much of who I am so I am thankful that others believe in me.

            "Start contributing into a 401K right now if your job offers it. I cannot stress it enough to start immediately. Contribute however much you can afford but make sure to take full advantage of any company matching at the very least. Compound interest is going to set you up for life if you start now and keep at it. If your job doesn't have a retirement plan, open an IRA. You will thank yourself later.\n\nIf you are in your early 20s you might read this and think yeah yeah yeah I'll get to it eventually I've got plenty of time. I know this because that was me at the age of 22. I always remembered the advice but my dumb ass ignored it. I don't have many regrets at all, but that is one of them.\n\nAnd you do have plenty of time for sure, but if you start young and keep at it you WILL retire a millionaire. Hell you could hit a million or more before you turn 60 and retire early if you start now. You might earn 60K a year or 160K. It doesn't matter. You can retire a millionaire.\n\nEither way save what you can right now or you will regret it in the years ahead. This doesn't mean you have to live like a pauper either. Save what you can to continue living your life and you will be golden.\n\nEdit to add a very low end example. If you make 50K/yr and contribute just 10% total (including any company match) that would be $5,000 per year. With just a 5% rate of return starting at 25 years old you would retire at 67 with over 700K. It's recommended that you have 10-12x your annual salary at retirement. Even given these very low values, in this case you would likely be retiring with 14x your annual salary. You would be golden.\n\nAnd note in my example the person never receives a raise and never contributes more than 10% total per year. Also 5% returns is overall on the low end as well.

All of the above is what I feel most days, ofc it is not like this at all times. Been in bad long-term relationships before.

He not only would do what he could to make things easier for me, he offered to fix up the two rooms he had available in his house for me and my kids to move in. (I declined lmao they hadn\u2019t even met him yet and I\u2019m strict on who I allow around them .. but I thought it was very sweet because that\u2019s a lot to take on.) Because I was working nights, I would sleep the majority of when I went to his house, and he would gently check on me, bring me water, offer me food, rub my back gently. He brought me ice cream because I was craving it, IN A SNOW STORM. When I would vent about work drama, he would ask questions and be engaged and made me feel heard. I think the biggest green flag for me, is his patience. I still have ptsd from my previous relationship and even though he\u2019s never done anything to indicate cheating, he can read my body language and can tell I\u2019m mentally spiraling. He will pull me close and assure me that he would never do that to me and when I get so upset with myself because he doesn\u2019t deserve that, he tells me he knows it\u2019s a trauma response and he wants to be my safe space. I could name so many more, but I\u2019ll stop there. Lol. We\u2019ve been together for 6 years, married just shy of 1 year and he\u2019s continued to be the same sweet, selfless, patient and caring man.",
            "For me- 27 years of marriage today! I\u2019m different than the poster you\u2019re asking - He\u2019s patient with everyone, sincerely polite, self-reliant, encouraging, calm. Plenty of my friends apologize for their partners. I\u2019ve never had to apologize for him- he isn\u2019t rude, doesn\u2019t lose his temper.",
            "I knew he was the one because when we first met we instantly connected. I felt so comfortable sharing my deepest thoughts and feelings to him like we were best friends. He respected me for who I am from the very beginning. He never tried to change me. He calls me out on my bullshit. I've grown to a better version of myself because of him.",
            "When i was sick, he took the day off work and stayed home to take care of me. He bought food, meds, and even cooked me chicken porridge following by my instructions. Even after we\u2019re married, he does the same thing. \n\nI was sick many times before and always had to take care of myself so i was ready to do the same thing. I told him to not worry but he came to care for me anyway. I really like that",

My kids biological father is very much involved in their lives though. It took me 8 months to introduce them to my husband and he loves being their step dad. Trust me, I\u2019ve given him many outs lol he could have taken it. My son is an anime freak just like my husband. They wake up and watch anime together and have breakfast every morning. What\u2019s also funny is, I remember hearing him at work say he wasn\u2019t a kid person at all so I was like well there goes that. Oh well. Well when I asked him about it he said he was always scared of having kids of his own because of the depression he was always fighting but since meeting me he has never felt that again. \n\nMy point to all of this rambling is lol maybe give one of us single moms a try \ud83d\ude02 you never know.

I went through a harsh breakup of a 5 year relationship, she screwed me over royally, left my psyche split and I\u2019m still a bit fucked in the head behind my masks.  So much pain it turns to anger and you form an exterior to protect the distressed child inside.  Ill bet someone wronged you too, but I didn\u2019t let my hate turn me into a angry negative person.  You refuse to be gaslit and controlled anymore by social structure because you followed those rules and still got fucked over.  \n\nThat inner child was innocent and naive to the coldness of reality.  And now big brother comes in to save you from the way you were wronged.  Promising to protect you and vigilant for the worst in others.  Analyzing so deeply into why people act the way they do.  Why do people betray, why do they say one thing but then act another way.  \n\nDo that long enough your character and identity becomes corrupted and twisted by the negativity.  You become something ugly.  \n\nGet off the internet and just do the hard work to build a life of value which spreads positivity and love.  Everything else will figure itself out for you if you just become a good strong confident person.  It is HARD work get off your ass and live.  Get off the red pill algorithms.
