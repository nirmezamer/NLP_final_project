As a result the art contest is going to be extended till the end of June.\n\nHere are the rules (slightly adjusted):\n\n- Submissions must be flaired \u201cart contest\u201d.\n- Art must follow the rules as done by oc fanart posts.\n- Art should fit into a circle so the subreddit icon is legible. It won\u2019t be disqualified if it isn\u2019t but the mods might have to make drastic edits to make it fit.\n- Users can only have one submission each. They\u2019re free to change it at any time before July but they can only have one at any time \n\nContest\u2019s open till July 1st, when we will release a poll that\u2019ll run for a week to determine the winner.",

Makima was still so obsessed with Chainsaw Man she would've put a target on Denji's back so he would've been lit up and his resolve would've been put to the test pretty early on, since he would not be able to avoid killing a Devil in that form he would've been on everyone's radar.",

This is why the Kobeni restaurant sequence exists in the first place: Since the contract between Denji and him was broken, he tried his hardest to make a similar contract with Denji again by 'reigniting' his will to live and continue to dream. (A few examples are when he ate clean hamburgers instead of rotten ones, since that's what Denji always wanted. He then goes on a date with Kobeni because that's what younger Denji always dreamed of doing. And so on).\n\nAfter Makima had \"completely fucked him up\", Pochita failed at making a contract with Denji again. However, the Blood Devil, Power, swooped in and saved the day by giving Denji a new goal (a dream), which then motivated Denji enough to form the contract with Pochita (This finally brought Denji back). The point here is that Pochita cares darely for Denji and did everything he could to bring back Denji.\n\n>he claim that he was too strong to have friends and hug people, we see it's not the case with Kobeni while he murdered everyone around her on purpose\n\nHe is still too strong to have friends with others and hug them, but yes. Pochita is, of course, still a Devil and killed those who were abusing Kobeni (he did kill them since they were causing a ruckus, but that doesn't matter). This doesn't take away from the fact that he cares for Denji, tho. He willingly spent years of his time with him after all. (They both benefited from each other, all while having a healthy relationship).\n\n>he could have ignored Kishibe Squad and just move to attack Makima first but instead he chose to murdere them ,\n\nNever killed them. They killed themselves. Pochita went straight for Makima when he returned from Hell.\n\n>he told Denji to take care of the equivalent of an abusive relationship child and give it all the love in the world without trying to comfort him\n\nThis is expecting too much out of a Devil he cant understand much about relationships. He still cares for Denji and advised him to give Nayuta lots of Hugs to make it easier for Denji (it would have been great if he comforted him, of course).\n\n>he saw how miserable Denji was yet acted as it was a good thing when he asked him about his next Dream\n\nYup. This is his way of caring for Denji (it doesn't seem like he can have full-blown out conversations with him, and his time is contrived).\n\nAnyways, while Pochita being a Devil does play part in this discussion, I believe a more satisfying answer is what this person stated here (I would modify the wording a bit, but the message is still delivered);\n\n[I'll reply to myself with the image bcs Reddit won't let me show it for some reason]",

If I were in the same place as him, even I would want to kill everyone without even thinking twice. The difference is, Reze was able to kill Denji without taking many lives with him, Of course you can also say that the Typhoon Devil He also destroyed a part of the city, but he was just focusing on helping Reze and Killing Chainsaw Man/Denji, Just as Reze herself killed Tokyo Division 2 just to show that she is powerful, Reze herself could also have killed Denji without even going through so much trouble.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/asgtti2ld38d1.png?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f639572c04e8179f336d9e4e6222bcfc65e8b057\n\nReze was a soldier of the Soviet Union, which has extremely powerful demon hunters (Santa Claus) and has a huge part of the Gun Devil, She clearly had more training and more experience than Denji in combat and also in assassinations,  Considering that the Soviet Union raised and trained Reze from childhood for this job, I honestly can't believe that Reze was having trouble killing Denji, which she wasn't. At any moment Reze can kill Denji, we see this all the time in the fight but instead she tries to tire him and destroys everything in front of her, with even a beautiful scene of the Angel Devil Telling a woman that she will go to Heaven. See, Reze always had the advantage on her side besides that she could simply Fly and take Denji somewhere and kill him, just like she does with Pochita. But like i said in the other comment, that's just my opinion.",

She might have betrayed him later and it probably was more about her wanting to escape her situation than her wanting to be with denji. \n\nAlso denji literally forgot about her after like 3 panels. \n\nAsa has yet to actually harm denji in fact she warned him about herself.
