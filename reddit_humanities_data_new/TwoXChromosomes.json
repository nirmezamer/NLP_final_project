The law already makes it illegal to circulate images of a child, even if those images were fake, and the penalty is the same as if they were real. If prosecutors are refusing to do their jobs, that is a whole different problem.\n\nJust to be clear, this law would mean fake images would get more jail time than actual images, which makes no sense at all. The reason Ted Cruz is on board, is this is a way of going after social media, and removing LGBTQ from society, because Right-Wing Republicans like Cruz continue to say LGBT images are child porn or grooming children.

Usually the magnitude of punishments matters little for deterrence, and the probability of catching someone matters lots.",
            "I'm curious where you got your research from, because this take seems based solely on fear and conjecture. There is nothing currently in this proposed law that would criminalize \"LGBTQ images.\" All it does is specify target nonconsensual distribution of intimate images both AI generated and not.\u00a0\n\n\nYour citation about the federal guide to CSAM does nothing to address the fact that this new law protects adults as well making it easier to take down nonconsensual intimate images, which currently is extremely difficult. As it stands there is no legal mechanism to enforce anti-NCII laws across state lines because it is not a federal crime. Websites and platforms currently have no obligation to remove NCII unless the images are copyrighted material.\u00a0\n\n\nDo you know what kind of intimate images cannot be copyrighted by the victims of these crimes? AI generated images or images taken without their consent. This new law will address that massive issue. Currently victims of NCII have to go through the long process of copyrighting the intimate images and playing legal whack-a-mole to take them down. Meanwhile their sense of security and reputation are being eroded every minute they stay up. This law creates a mechanism to compel websites and platforms to take down NCII at the request of the victim or survivor.\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally there is no federal law that criminalizes NCII, and current protection for these victims are spotty at best as ot stands. Every state has their own laws regarding the distribution of NCII, and their definitions of the law and the consequences vary wildly. In some states it's a misdemeanor, others it's a felony. Some states ban generated NCII, others only protect against distribution of authentic images taken of the victim. There are also two states where publishing and distributing NCII is LEGAL.\u00a0 This law would address that.\u00a0\n\n\nTldr as it stands this law seems to be a good faith attempt to protect ALL victims of NCII, not just victims of AI Generated NCII.\u00a0",

As for removals, platforms should be removing all cases of CSAM (underage) deepfakes under Section 230, once they become aware of the content itself.\n\nLegal penalties are typically not pursued by the company because it isn't their legal obligation or interest to do so. If the person who is being impersonated or LE wishes to pursue legal action, they'd need to have legal papers sent to the company's legal/privacy/LE team, usually in the form of a preservation request, to keep the data from being permanently deleted. They'd then have to prove/present a case for the information to be disclosed for use in a legal case. Data disclosure is a very strict action because of privacy policies and laws, so there must be a strong case for it. \n\nIf the content itself is suspected to be revenge porn or CSAM, it is typically preserved for potential legal action by LE. In cases of CSAM, many platforms will package the data and send it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and/or in certain cases proactively disclose the information to law enforcement from the local level all the way to federal. \n\nDeepfakes as a content/harm vertical are still relatively new, so policy and procedures are still changing and adapting. From what I've seen, platforms are tackling the worst issues first (CSAM) by adapting existing policy and then evolving it to the intricacies of deepfakes. One of the challenges is that because it is AI generated (mostly), some ML models made to catch CSAM do not detect it.

I have no idea what the sentence is for distributing CP but surely making a deepfake of CSA should fall into a similar category.\n\nI can see for example how it would seem less dangerous than actually making genuine CP, since the child isn't physically being molested, but how is it so different from, say, a sleeping child being photographed nude? (This is so horrible to even discuss.) It's still a massive violation of their privacy and perpetuates the exploitation of children. \n\nI guess in short, it seems wild to me that a prison sentence for a criminal would be shorter than the amount of time their victim would likely require therapy.",
            "What are you talking about babe? Did you even read the story??\n\n>> Perpetrators who target adults could face up to two years in prison, while those who target children could face three years\n\nAdults are also targeted. Just because someone is prosecuted doesn\u2019t mean those images are erased. And then what if the person doesn\u2019t get convicted because they can\u2019t prove that it\u2019s AI? Are you unable to understand the basic concept?"

We were fighting for the week before that because I was feeling insecure that I had never met anyone in his life. I definitely pushed him over the edge.  \n4. He broke up with me a month ago because I pushed him too hard about meeting his family again and then became really irrational about it all. This was 100% my fault.
