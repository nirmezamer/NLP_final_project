            "I don't think the right really cares too much whether r/nz is nervous or not. It pretty quickly lost relevance once the majority realized being kind wasn't a strategy for making a country productive.\n\nEither that or they've been down voted to oblivion",
            "Grant was also going to cancel it / withdraw funding so don't think this is a nat/lab problem it's a kiwirail/govt problem.\n\nKiwirail fucked up",
            "I mean, I'm sure there are people on here with a diverse range of values/perspectives.  \nPersonally, I think I've seen more critiques of the current Coalition government than praise, in terms of posts/comments for example.  \nAt the end of the day, I don't think any set of values, ideology or worldview holds a monopoly on ideas such as common sense or truth.",
            "Absolutely\u2026 don\u2019t need to dig too deep to see which donors with deep pockets and vested interests \u2018advised\u2019 the coalition of chaos to dump the deal. NACTZ supporters now squealing how they wouldn\u2019t be ready now anyway completely missing the point that we now have NOTHING in the pipeline for this essential infrastructure\u2026 also squealing that NZ was broke, couldn\u2019t afford them, labour borrowed too much\u2026 blah, blah, blah Well let\u2019s look at how much NACTZ are borrowing to pay for kickbacks to landlords and tax cuts for the rich\u2026. Running down all our essential services so they can privatise them for their rich mates at tax payer expense\u2026 They are all for socialism and hand outs of tax payer money when it goes to them and the others at the top\u2026",

            "New Zealand is susceptible to the kind of misinformation driven interference precisely because we have a culture of glorifying ignorance.\n\nEducation, critical analysis, and the like aren't valued here. This is also exacerbated by a media that is hell bent on serving up the necessary drivel.\n\nThis is not unique to NZ of course, but it is particularly prevalent here, even without Murdoch media.",
            "That's demonstrably false.",
            "Thanks for the validation!",
            "Who is going to invade us, that we have a hope in hell of defending against regardless of what we buy?",
            "You haven't taken into account *marginal* changes in impact. \n\n\nMitigation efforts in relation to the interislander have a huge marginal impact. \n\n\nWhereas, quite frankly, if some country (China is usually the favourite antagonist in this conversation) wants to invade NZ, then it would take an utterly preposterous proportion of our GDP to develop any kind of *credible military deterrent* that would actually make a difference to that level of risk. The contracts would be assessed based upon the marginal change in risk level, i.e. an imperceptible shift between \"extremely low\" and \"extremely low (but now with added helicopters)\". \n\n\nI'm sure you're far too smart to have actually meant to come across as claiming those contracts would have a significant impact on our risk of invasion. (Which is why I tried to lead you in an easier direction a few comments ago - emergency response preparedness - which is actually a far more defensible position)",
            "The [timeline](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2023-12/Project%20iRex%20timeline.pdf) would suggest otherwise",

            "You're delusional if you think that \"productivity\" is the biggest issue that decided the election. That's an issue that only the core right wing base of National and ACT care about. \n\nSwing voters cared about the cost of living crisis but both parties had solutions to this problem and the public had lost faith in Labour. Crime and co-governance were the issues that won the right the election.\n\nAnyway, you still haven't explained how your original comment was  a joke. But I guess you have said some things I find funny, but I don't think they were deliberate jokes.",
            "The terminals were the issue, not the ferries. The ferries were a fixed-price contract, and a fucking good one. There isn't going to be a better deal for purpose-built ferries that would last probably 30 years, maybe more. Looking for cheaper options for the terminals was a good call by Robertson, and it should have been done. National fucked over the entire country by cancelling a good deal without a viable alternative because they wanted to score some 'we're reining in spending, Labor bad' points, hoping the general public was too stupid to know anything beyond 'there was a cost overrun on this project'.",

            "Whatever is going to make it happen (short of time travel) would be reinstating the previous purchase or equivalent except significantly more expensive. \n\nWhich to be clear, everybody involved knew was going to be the result, National just gambled that they could pass it off to Labour before the ferries started breaking down.",

            "What does this matter at all? The ferry service between our two islands is vital for the nation in many ways you banana.\u00a0\n\n- We need to replace these ferries\n- The sooner we do it the cheaper it will be\n- We had ordered a great one\n- we cancelled the whole thing because the cost increased for the port.\n\nWhatever we do now will have a worse outcome for NZ. This was blatantly obvious at the time. Nact1st have flushed billions literally down the drain and made it worse. What possible future course is better as a result of having cancelled this work?",
            "I agree Labor had also screwed up co governance and allowed too much crime during thier term as well as stifling productivity. It's all basically the same thing 'just be kind'",
