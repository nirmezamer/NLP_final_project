            "almost 400 people still out there naming their babies Khaleesi!",
            "I was expecting Mateo to hit the top 10 this year , but I'm surprised it entered all the way at #6! No real surprises for me in the girls' top 10, although I did notice that there continues to be a steady decline in the number of girls given each top 10 name; in 2018, 18,814 girls were given the #1 name and 10,428 were given the #10 name, but in 2023, those numbers were 15,270 and 7,811 respectively.\n\nThe biggest top 100 surprise for me was Lainey jumping a whopping 120 ranks to #54. I knew from last year's state popularity lists that it had some regional popularity (in the Midwest, I think?) but I didn't expect it to make such a splash on the national list. I'm also surprised the Juniper didn't crack the top 100 and instead held steady at #113.\n\nHere's the full rundown of the new entries into the top 100, if anyone's curious:\n\nBoys:\n\n* Thiago (#77, #107 in 2022)\n* Enzo (#90, #121 in 2022)\n* Luka (#95, #117 in 2022)\n* Amir (#99, #113 in 2022)\n* Gael (#100, #104 in 2022)\n\nGirls:\n\n* Lainey (#54, #174 in 2022)\n* Maeve (#73, #103 in 2022)\n* Eden (#77, #117 in 2022)\n* Vivian (#87, #104 in 2022 - re-entry into the top 100, last appeared in 2019)\n* Madeline (#94, #102 in 2022 - re-entry, last appeared in 2021)\n* Lyla (#98, #105 in 2022)\n* Clara (#99, #110 in 2022 - re-entry, last appeared in 2019)\n* Allison (#100, #101 in 2022 - re-entry, last appeared in 2021)\n\nI'm waiting until the top 1000 list is cross-posted on Behind the Name to do more analysis, since that list includes the rank, numerical, and percent changes for each name and gives a better sense of what's rising outside of the top 100.",
            "I'm surprised Mateo is at 6th!\n\nI'm also surprised Mia is still in the top 10. In all my years around children (teaching and my own kids), I've met 1, maybe 2 Mias.",
            "Names that rose the most by absolute numbers, girls: Lainey (by a lot), Amira, Wrenley, Eden, Eliana, Lucy. Georgia, Margot, Aitana, Maeve, Antonella, Millie, Sofia, Kaeli, Adaline. Ashley. Alora. Mia, Sadie, Kaia\n\nNames that fell the most by absolute numbers, girls: Ava, Olivia, Luna, Scarlett, Emma, Isabella, Everleigh, Everly, Nova, Abigail. Ella, Mila, Natalie, Chloe, Kinsley, Stella, Zoey, Nevaeh, Harper, Elizabeth",
            "So cute, I\u2019m looking at the longer list and Juliet was ranked 292 while Romeo ranked 293 \ud83e\udd79",
            "Some names that weren't in the 2022 stats now being given to more than 5 girls:\n\nRumani, Cimani, Naiari, Lylla, Azaylie, Nizaraly, Seoni, Azhani, Xalia, Merlina, Daia, Mazuri, Makaiah, Aryya, Aluney, Aneley, Kridha, Yanaisy, Keighley, Simora\n\nNames that dropped out of the stats in 2023: Nerina, Shifa, Soleen, Karelyn, Keisi, Alyn, Averey, Ioanna, Rahel, Athira, Kennia, Kumani, Meeka, Yoali, Jizel, Larsyn, Leeanne, Zyia, Carlyn, Elyssia",
            "Maeve and Vivian making the expected moves up. Surprised by Lainey tho!",
            "This is my Super Bowl.",
            "I am so surprised Jude or Cooper isn\u2019t up there. Where I am there are sooo many boys with those names!",
            "Am I reading this right?  Only one new name in the top 10 for boys *and* girls?",
            "You know what\u2019s interesting is how all of the different spellings really can make a name so much more popular. Like with the data you can total the spellings together of Lila/Lilah/Lyla which makes the name really be ranked around #33 if you total the number of births with each of those spellings\n\nEdit: since I posted this, nameberry came out with the 2023 playground analysis that does exactly what I mentioned above - here\u2019s the link if anyone is interested (all US data) https://nameberry.com/blog/2023-playground-analysis",
            "Not surprised that Maeve and Margot have both jumped up quite a bit. I imagine both of those will keep climbing. I could see it for Adeline as well.\n\nI\u2019m curious to see when Eleanor makes the top 10. Next year (2024), surely?? I think it could be destined to be a #1 name.",
            "Mateo finally made its way to the top 10 \ud83c\udfc6",
            "I think Clara at some point with soar and no one is talking about STELLA. The \u201ca\u201d ending, the nature trend. Luna of moon is in top ten so what about the stars . Stella is a more attractive sounding name too imo and can transition better to an adult. I bet it\u2019ll catch on some day",
            "Olivia, Emma, Sophia, and Isabella were all super popular when I was working in L&D over 15 years ago. Ava and Mia, too. I'm kind of surprised they're still as high up as they are. Interestingly it seems like the boys' names have changed a lot, except for Liam and Noah. \n\nAlso, my husband's going to be annoyed when he realizes our daughter's name hit the top 10 (which doesn't surprise me at all)! \ud83d\ude02",
            "I'm surprised at Evelyn's resurgence. It's a very 1930s British name to me. Maybe that Evelyn Hugo book? Any other thoughts?",
            "I thought I\u2019d post the top 10 for Australia in 2023, interesting many are similar and some different.. \n\nThe country differences are fascinating \n\n\nHere\u2019s the top 10 for Australia in 2023\n\n1) Oliver & Charlotte\n\n2)Noah & Amelia\n\n3) Leo & Ilsa \n\n4)  William & Olivia\n\n5) Henry & Mia\n\n6) Jack & Ava\n\n7) Theodore & Matilda\n\n8) Hudson & Ella\n\n9) Charlie & Grace\n\n10) Luca & Willow",
            "My name went from #590 the year I was born to #25 last year. Crazy",
            "Are you telling me it was a whole year ago I looked at the 2022 list for name inspiration for my son!?",
            "I\u2019m surprised Aurora isn\u2019t on there. I know 3 baby Auroras",
            "Wow the name Arlo went from #915 in 2011 to #158 in 2023. Do you think it\u2019s bc of Ted lasso (the commentator)?",
            "My favorite boy\u2019s name (Everett) went down a few spots! Love that for me.",
            "Wow Scottie jumped from 923 to 617!! That\u2019s huge",
            "No kids but proud my name still hasn\u2019t cracked the top 1000. Crazy popular in the UK though!",
            "I'm quite surprised by the inclusion of Luna in the top ten. To me it's definitely more of a pet name than a human one, but clearly others feel different",
            "Chozen increasing significantly in popularity \ud83e\udd74",
            "I'm surprised by how relatively low these are:\n\n\nSeraphina #974\n\n\nAdele #823\n\n\nBillie #865\n\n\nTallulah #817\n\n\nRosa #668\n\n\nFern (outside of top 1000)\n\n\n\n\nSurprised by how relatively high these are:\n\n\nAshley #126\n\n\nAnastasia #167\n\n\nRuth #187\n\n\nStevie #244\n\n\nPalmer #277\n\n\nOctavia #279\n\n\nDream #335\n\n\nSunny #406",
            "Anyone know when the state specific 2023 lists come out? You\u2019d think they\u2019d be at the same time since they have the data",
            "My younger son's name (Rowan) is suddenly more popular than my older son's name (Silas) by rocketing up 20 spots! He's gonna be one of those \"I was a Rowan before it was cool\" kids when it's in the top 10 in a decade!",
            "Thiago entering the top 100 is well deserved. Literally the coolest name. I love it",
            "This is just me thinking out loud and I know it's not possible, but I wish there was data on what name the child actually goes by.  For example, Eleanor is #14 but Ellie is #27.  I wonder how many Eleanor's actually go by Ellie and what would happen to Ellie's rank if we had this data?\n\nJust something I always think about - and wish they collected this data (knowing that often nicknames can change or are established later in life).",
            "The biggest surprise for me it's bene the break down of Eden in the top 100",
            "Does anyone know how I can search outside of the top 1000? I want to search my baby\u2019s name which is well outside the top 1000 but I\u2019m not sure how to do so. I want to see how many babies born last year have the name!",
            "Luna being in the top ten is gonna stay weird to me for a while.",
            "Mia is a little surprising - my 15 year old niece is a Mia and I associate it more with 10-18 year olds than current babies. I also have teenage nephews Henry and Theodore. Hard to imagine now, but they felt way less expected in the 2000s. I feel like most male babies I know are Theodore, Oliver, Henry, Miles or Elliot; always expect the latter two to rank higher.",
            "I\u2019m really surprised Harper didn\u2019t crack the top 10. It seems like it\u2019s such a popular choice nowadays",
            "As a mother of a Luna, I find it sweet to see others loving it too. I absolutely love and adore her name. She loves it too.",
            "I came back to say that there are now ***7*** versions of Kehlani on the list in addition to a bunch of other lani names. This is the new trend for girls.",
            "In 2023, I knew 2 babies named James, 1 Mateo 1 Henry, and 1 Theodore! None from the girls' list!\n\n\nETA: And 1 Lucas!",
            "8/10 of the girl names end in \"a\". In my country (Scotland), 6/10 of the top girl names ended in \"a\". \n\nIt's interesting that people tend to notice when an initial or beginning sound is trending (the \"el-\" names, for example), but not the last letter or syllable. Since I have an A last name, I'm guessing that one reason for this is that most last names start with consonants, so a vowel ending for a first name flows well. Also, the human brain prioritises the first and last letters or numbers in a sequence, so the end of a first name falls in the centre when the parents decide on \"Lila Marie\" or \"Lila Smith\".",
            "Liam, Noah, Charlotte, Theodore, and Evelyn are my favorites!",
            "Lots of Luna hate :( oh well. We love the name and have no shame.",
            "Pretty relieved that my 2023 baby\u2019s name didn\u2019t explode in popularity. Sylvie catapulted 148 spots between 2021 and 2022 but only climbed 11 this year. \n\nPopular names are fine but it\u2019s our preference to avoid the most ubiquitous. There are so many fascinating names out there and I like when people use the deeper cuts.",
            "Two of my nieces, who turn 22 and 14 this year, are still in the top 10. I'm surprised it wasn't all 3!. Neither of my nephews, though.",
            "I'm surprised to see Malaysia on the list as a girl's name",
            "Surprised Violet isn\u2019t on there! I know like 3!",
            "I looked at the boys list and were to write that you had to go surpricingly far down (top 150) before things starts to get weird. Then I looked at the girls list and realised that Genesis is a number 57.",
            "Hudson at #21! Never realized how popular it was",
            "Huzzah! It's the day of the year when I find out whether enough people named their kid my kid's name for it to even show up in the data!\n\nUpdate: 5 babies with his name. Which has been about the same as every year since he was born.",
            "Mateo is so high, a pleasant surprise",
            "All lovely names.",
            "Luna is what my friend named their new dog last year.",
            "Feeling relieved that my twin girls (born this year) names are both still pretty deep in the top 1000. I have a top five name for the year I was born and I wanted to avoid that with my girls",
            "luna?? knew its in the top 100 but dang",
            "My husband named our daughter Luna thinking it was the most exotic unique name (she was born on September 2022). We know a bunch of Lunas now, he is pretty disappointed lol",
            "I love these. \n\nMy oldest son's name continues to decrease in popularity. It was 33 when he was born and is 231 now. It dropped from 206 last year. \n\nMy second son's name was 15 when he was born and has has a steady hold of the number 1 spot for a few years now. \n\nMy third son's name officially fell out of thr top 200 this year. It was 178 when he was born. If you are looking for a known name that is losing popularity, name your son Jesse.\n\nMy fourth son's name is ranked 220, down from 158 the year he was born. \n\nAll have dropped in popularity other than Liam. The name we are considering for possible Boy 5 is rising in popularity.",
            "There was something stuck on my screen, so the last pair looked like William and Tuna. Yeah, that surprised me!",
            "Wow I though Nora/Norah would be on this",
            "I just glanced at the top 100, and my daughters\u2019 names are 64 and 65 lol",
            "100 percent expected. Most names have been there for yearssssss uggg. Luna crept in not surprised. The only surprise is Mateo! I know multiples of all the others.",
            "There were 75 girls named James in 2023, down from 85 in 2022.",
            "Please let Luna drop in popularity. My mom thought she was being so original when she named me in 1996 \ud83d\ude2d",
            "Unfortunately, for the most part, they really are great names...",
            "All classics! I love the resurgence of old school names",
            "It's sad that Sophia/Sofia should be #1 - but is not because of the different spellings...",
            "Unrelated but I have not thought about Martin O'Malley in 8 years. Seeing him present the names countdown was unexpected.",
            "A name I saw for the first time today that I'm now in love with after looking at the data is Ainhoa!",
            "Is Liam really that popular? I know it's number 1 in the US (I live in Canada) but I haven't met any one with that name.\u00a0",
            "When I try to search my daughters name it says page not found \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd23",
            "Bummed my top name is now officially in the top 100",
            "My top baby names have been marked safe!",
            "Not from US, but it surprises me how \"white\" and British and even 19th century the top 10 is.",
            "I\u2019ve loved Ava, Sophia and Elijah for years :(",
            "Pissed about Hazel being up top. Why does it make me like the name less??? Ugh.",
            "My son's name became weirdly popular in media over the last 3 years and I'm happily shocked it hasn't gone up more in popularity.",
            "I have an Elijah and know very few others; it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s been a top name for a while. They must live elsewhere\u2014-",
            "I named my tortoises Matteo (Italian version) in four years ago. Though I was unique. Cries.",

            "Oliver, Olivia & Theodore are my favourite \u2764",
            "I have an Oliver :) Although, my Oliver was born in 1995 - I was surprised to see it jump in popularity after a few years. It wasn't even in the top 100 when he was born, but now? Little Olivers everywhere LOL!",
            "I would love to know where Asher, Monroe, Meyer and Arlo falls in? I feel like I always hear someone yelling the name in playgrounds these days",
            "I\u2019m fascinated by Gael being #100 for boys. I\u2019ve never even heard of this name being used on boys before with this spelling. \n\nWhere did this come from? Is it a fandom name or something? Does anyone have any insight?",

            "Elijah is surprising to me. No one ever suggests it, and the only one I met is 37 now.\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting to compare top 10 by state.",

However, because the number of girls that are given top 10 names has been decreasing in recent years (all of the top 10 girls names of 2023 declined in numerical usage except for Mia, which only increased by 298 births), it's entirely possible that in the next few years, girls' names can jump into the top 10 even though they aren't getting big boosts in the number of births. So if that's the case, I think Eleanor still has a chance to reach the top 10 in the next few years, simply because a lot of the other names in the top 20 might be falling faster in terms of number of births.\n\nEleanor's also a name with a lot of regional popularity (it was a top 10 name in 14 states in 2022), but it's also not as popular in a lot of the high-population states, which often have a big influence on the national rankings.

So I'm assuming Madeline is sticking around because Madelyn has been steadily popular for the past 15 or so years (it ranked #58 in 2023 and has ranked in the #50-#75 range since 2008).\n\nAllison's popularity seems to be fairly regional. 2023's state-by-state data isn't out yet, but in 2022, it ranked in the #40-#80 range in New Mexico, Texas, Delaware, Maryland, Florida, California, and Arizona. California and Texas in particular can be big influences on a name's national popularity because they're such high-population states - for example, roughly 30% of the Allisons born in 2022 were born in either California or Texas.\n\n(I'm an Allison in my early 30s myself, and it definitely surprises me as well that statistically there are still so many baby Allisons! Most other people I encounter with the name are in the 20-50 age range and a lot of the other girl names that had their heyday in the 80s and 90s haven't stuck around popularity-wise.)",

(I'd be inclined to think that the Made-lynn pronunciation is more popular for Madeline because Madelyn itself is also popular, but Made-line has the cultural touchstone of the Madeline books that would make people want to use that pronunciation instead, so who knows!)\n\nBut I get you on how combined spellings lists can have some oddities in them.

You'd think there'd be a big spike of baby Taylors in recent years due to Taylor Swift's massive success and popularity, but the name Taylor has been on a steady decline since 2008 (which was when Taylor Swift's career started really picking up speed). I imagine it's because the name Taylor was at its popularity height for baby girls in 1993-1999, an age group that's now having kids of their own, so even the biggest Swifties are probably looking for something fresher that's not a name they heard all the time growing up.",

My current name starts with an A so I wanted to go by something that also started with an A just to make things easier and to keep my initials. I hated every name I saw until I saw august. I know august is a boys name, but I love it. I thought it was wierd it was a boys name since its just a month, I mean what makes it different from April or may? But anyways, if I started going by August do you think people would be really critical? I mean I know there would be some people who think it's a wierd name for a girl but I just love the name. So do you guys think it's a bad idea? Does anybody have names that kind of sound similar that are more unisex? Trying to avoid names too traditionally one way or the other so a unisex name is ideal, but is August just too masculine?

            "My son is a male August, we call him Auggie, we like it a lot but Auggie is definitely uncommon. \n\nAugusta is a place, as well as the feminine version. Just something to be mindful of. \n\nThat being said. Not everyone likes my kid\u2019s name. I don\u2019t care. Cause he\u2019s not their kid. You\u2019re not even naming someone else, you\u2019re making yourself. If you like it, tell everyone else to kick rocks.",

            "I don\u2019t think you should feel pressured to use Augusta or Augustine so other people think your name is girly enough, when you said in the post you wanted a masculine name. August is a perfectly good name, and Auggie is plausibly a more neutral name for people who\u2019ll be weird about it.\n\nBoy-name-on-girl criticisms are mostly about babies who get saddled with names that might not fit who they are. It\u2019s not the same as you, a near-adult, giving yourself a name *you* like.",

            "August is more connected to a male person since the name and the month derives from the emperor who remaned the month and the calendar. However there are many Roman empresses called Augustina. However I find the name August in modern day can match with girls as well. Good luck in your choice",
            "The reason people think of August as masculine is because of Augustus, a Roman Caesar. And who the month of August is named after. So historically, it has a masculine vibe. But most people are pretty detached from the Roman empire and just think of the month when they hear the name August. I personally don't think it matters if you like the name. Plenty of people have names that break traditional gender norms. But I would consider telling people your new name before legally changing it to see how you feel about it.",
            "huh, I do like the name. I'll keep it in mind!",

            "My husband works with a man called \u201cFingers.\u201d I asked why he gets called Fingers and apparently it\u2019s because he has fat thumbs. They also have someone called \u201cBig Al\u201d who is actually very much small and skinny. Nothing big about him (or so I\u2019ve heard). Nicknames don\u2019t even have to make sense lol.",

            "yeah august doesn't feel like that much of a masculine name lol, I kinda feel like not too many people would care all that much to see a girl with the name but idk.",
            "I've seen a lot of people say autumn and I do likr the name but I just don't feel the same connection, appreciate the comment!",
            "thank you! people are saying that since it's named after a Roman emperor it shouldn't be used for a girl, but I feel like when people hear it people will just think of the month. I appreciate your comment <3",

            "I mean Minnie Mouse is pretty cool though. Also there's Minnie Driver who was definitely named after Disney existed and plenty of people name their kids Disney Princess names. But it might be more common as a nn. So maybe what about Willamina nn Minnie or Jessamine or Jasmine.\u00a0",

I agree with the one comment that says she's going to be saying, \"Minnie, like the mouse,\" to everyone she needs to tell her name to. It's not so much that she'll get bullied \u2013 kids find all sorts of things to bully other kids about \u2013 but that it'll get really old, really fast, and it won't be something she can try to avoid by going by her full name if that *is* her full name.\n\nI think it's totally fine for Minnie to be a nickname, and even for that to be what she's primarily called.

All your daughter's peers will 100% think Mouse, and all their parents will assume you are a Disney Adult. (I guess that's fine, if you are one!)\n\n2. There's enough similar names out there (Millie, Ginny) that she will absolutely have to go through life saying \"Minnie, like the mouse\" to baristas and receptionists. Not the end of the world, but again, she'll be forever tied to that association.\n\n3. It sounds exactly like \"mini.\" Have you considered she might be short? Or very tall?\n\nOptions you could consider to honor your grandmother: \n\n* Minna is a real, pretty, and very similar name without the mouse association.\n* Give her a name that ends in the \"min\" sound (Yasmin, Jessamine, etc.) and call her Minnie at home, but let her go by her full name at school.\n* If you feel you must absolutely name her Minnie, call her Minnie Rose, use them together as her name.\n\nEdit: typo.",

            "This was my major concern as well. TBH, I'd do a different legal name and probably use it as a nickname of I were going to do it at all. I'm not sure I would, though!",

I love the old fashioned names and that's what I think of with it too, but wouldn't want to give my daughter a name she'd wind up hating either. \n\nI've thought about Rosalie Minnie too, I think my husband is more concerned about the flow of it than I am so not sure he'd be down with that one!",

            "I 100% agree. Minnie is a darling nickname. But if I were OP, I would choose a longer legal name, whether Minerva or something else. And if baby grows up and stays Minnie, she can legally change her name once she\u2019s 18.",

She was born in 1912 when it was quite a popular name. \n\nHer middle name was Rose, and the name Rose goes through that entire side of my family everywhere. She'd be equally as touched if I named her Rose, but hubby doesn't like it. Rosalie is our top name at the moment though, but we can't seem to agree on a middle name that works well with it.",

And yes, those are actually people I went to school with I can show you my yearbook.\n\n  \nIf kids want to be mean, they will find a way! And honoring Grannie, may she rest in peace, is such a beautiful thing. I was so close to mine and she passed almost 3 years ago. She was more of a mother than my real mother. So do what you have to do to honor Grandma cause she sounds amazing! \ud83e\udd79",
            "Since the mean kids are unpredictable wrt the reason they are mean, it makes sense to me that your goal is to help them own their name. Help them be proud of it. She will be named for her great grandmother, a strong, kind and wonderful woman. The more pride she has in her name and herself the harder she'll be to bully. BTW - the same is true for boys.\n\nGood luck",

            "It doesn\u2019t matter the reason for bullying, name, big ears, fat, skinny, embarrassing happenstance kids will find a thing to pick on. What stops it from becoming a thing is how your child reacts. If you\u2019re a big cry baby and run tattling that people are mean they will *definitely* keep going for that reaction. Ask me how I know \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI made it a point to tease my kids all the time when they were little and let them tease me and then laugh it off or say \u2018good one\u2019.

            "This is one of my favorite names, especially because there are so many fun ways to shorten it: Will, Minnie, Mina. \n\nIt'd give the kid a lot of options to play with, which I think is a boon in a name.",

You can barely get 5 people to agree on where to eat, but most of them will agree pizza is delicious.

It will get annoying, but you just keep saying it to people.  \n\nWe did share a name with MIL, but it was because FIL &SIL had recently passed and our tradition is to name after a deceased relative (the actual name or using the same first letter).  We wanted to make sure she was ok with our plan because things were still so raw.  We ended up changing our plan a little, but did not share the name with MIL at that point.",

Looking back, I should have just used the name anyway, but I was young and worried about what others would think of me if I gave my daughter a 'dumb' name.\n\nMoral of the story - don't tell people your favourite names, and don't take advice from people who have kids called Mikayla and Rylee.",
            "I'm genuinely not sure. I think it would depend on how much I loved the name and the kind of criticism I received. \n\nFor instance, if a name is simply not to someone's taste, then I think I would be fine to use it - and thankfully the majority of people in my life are sensitive enough to know not to express that sentiment if they knew I really liked a particular name. If someone did say they didn't like the name, it would probably knock my confidence a bit; I'd probably weigh my options again and try to figure out just how much I like it. If it still felt right then I'd still use it.\n\nBut if someone who's opinion I value, for instance my Mum, who wouldn't say something negative unless she was seriously seriously concerned, I would probably be deterred.",
