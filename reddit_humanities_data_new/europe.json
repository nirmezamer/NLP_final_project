            "Putin and peace proposals are in the news again, so I think it is worth repeating:\n\n* Any peace deal that leaves Ukraine without NATO membership or an equivalent strong binding military alliance against Russia (with the lack of NATO or such alliance often labeled misleadingly as \"Ukrainian neutrality\") is not a peace deal but only a temporary ceasefire, which Russia will break the moment they think they have a good opportunity. Without an alliance, there is nothing to enforce Russia following the treaty. Same goes for any peace deal that seeks to disarm Ukraine. And in fact Russian proposals have generally demanded both neutrality and disarmament.\n\n* Russian proposals generally are not serious, as evidenced by them making demands such as above. Such unserious proposals have only the purpose of attempting to buy Russia time to reorganise for new offensives, or to feed grotesquely false propaganda along the lines of \"Russia wants peace, but Ukraine doesn't want it / NATO won't let Ukraine do it\".\n\n* Russia has repeatedly broken treaties and agreements and as a consequence has very little credibility and is not to be trusted. Russian propaganda will constantly point towards supposed vague verbal promises about NATO expansion made to Gorbachev, which never entered any formal written treaty, while it has constantly broken everything from the Helsinki Accords, to the Russia-NATO Founding act, to the Budapest memorandum, to the Minks agreements, all of which are actual formal treaties.\n\n* The sole responsibility for this war is on Russia, Russia is the one who invaded and started the war and continues it, and it is entirely within Russia's options to immediately make peace: Russia can end the war at any time simply by withdrawing from Ukrainian territory. \n\nThe correct answer to any Russian \"peace proposals\" is and remains this: Or Russia could just go home.",
            "https://www.ft.com/content/e63d6bb3-4381-4731-9724-d059e4eabf60\n\n*The writer, co-winner of the 2022 Nobel Prize for Peace, heads the Center for Civil Liberties in Kyiv and is on the board of the Institute for War & Peace Reporting*\n\nMy friend, a writer, texted last night from his trench to say a gentle goodbye. His unit is expecting an attack any time, but they do not have the heavy artillery they need to repel the assault.\n\nI am thousands of miles away from Ukraine, on a six-city lecture tour across the US, addressing public meetings and briefing members of Congress. But the war stays with us Ukrainians wherever we may travel. Rest is impossible when, back home, the delay in delivering crucial arms is costing the lives of our friends, our relatives, our countrymen.\n\nThe $60bn US package has been stalled for months by what, for Americans, is domestic politics; for us Ukrainians, it is a matter of life and death. In my meetings here, I am frequently asked: since Ukraine cannot expect to defeat Russia on the battlefield, shouldn\u2019t it accept a land deal? Won\u2019t more arms just mean more death?\n\nIndeed, Ukraine has seen far too much death \u2014 I know, because my colleagues and I see it daily. For the past decade, my organisation has documented war crimes by Russian forces occupying my country. Since the full invasion in February 2022, the scale of crimes has escalated exponentially. With a network of Ukrainian groups, we have documented killings, rape and torture \u2014 beatings, peeling off fingernails, genital electric shock. One woman I interviewed had her eye extracted by a spoon. To date, we have documented 68,000 crimes.\n\nYet this is only the tip of the iceberg, because such crimes are central to both the method and the purpose of the invasion. The Russian position, as the president has made repeatedly clear, is that Ukrainian language and culture, that Ukraine and Ukrainians, do not exist.\n\nA premature deal would be wrong \u2014 not least because we tried it already, and it failed. In 2014, Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas. Ukraine was not able to respond effectively, and the international response was muted. A ceasefire was then agreed. All Russia did was use the next eight years to prepare forward bases for the next attack. Moscow will only do the same again.\n\nAn early deal would also be immoral. You do not make peace by disarming the invaded country. This would be occupation and we know what that would mean.\n\nIn a de-occupied area of the Kharkiv region, after the Ukraine army pushed Russian forces back, the degraded body of beloved Ukrainian children\u2019s writer Volodymyr Vakulenko was discovered in an unmarked mass grave in the Izyum woods. After extensive investigation, the Russian soldiers responsible for this crime have recently been identified.\n\nWhy kill a children\u2019s writer? Russia kills Ukrainian civilians because it can. After decades of brutal warfare \u2014 in Chechnya, in Syria and beyond \u2014 it has never been held accountable.\n\nRussia is now increasing its assaults on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, and we expect a major attack this summer. Our capital city, my home, could again be under direct threat.\n\nIn the meantime, destabilisation activities are under way against Moldova and other neighbouring countries. Moscow is the centre but Russia\u2019s imperial vision has no defined borders. This nightmare \u2014 this endless cataloguing of human pain \u2014 will only continue.\n\nThe solution is to defeat Russia and this authoritarian ideology. A stand must be made, and Ukrainians are bravely making it. War is horrible. But Ukrainians know what Russia brings, and the clear majority of the population \u2014 more than 70 per cent \u2014 support continuing the fight \u201cas long as it takes\u201d.\n\nWe respect American politics. We know every country has its own priorities and financial issues. We are grateful for the generous support we have received so far from the US, Europe and other countries around the world, both from governments and ordinary citizens. But now we need more help, and we need it soon. Ukraine wants peace more than anyone. But we cannot fight evil with empty hands. Strengthen Ukraine, let us pursue the war as far as we can \u2014 our vision is to the internationally recognised 1991 borders \u2014 and then we can discuss peace. Our friends in Russian human rights groups tell us the same: the best way to help Russian democracy is to defeat Russian militarism in Ukraine.\n\nThis is not a war for land. It is a war for survival. Not just of the Ukrainian people but of the basic values of human rights, of democracy, of liberty. The majority of American people know this and support more aid for Ukraine. The majority of members of Congress agree. Meanwhile, I continue to get text messages from the front every night. Will the US send fresh arms before it is too late?",

            "https://www.ft.com/content/98f37cee-aaf6-47c5-b032-bde2968e00f0\n\nThe last time David Cameron, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, urged Capitol Hill to pass Ukraine aid, he was told to \u201ckiss my ass\u201d by Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of the most vocal pro-Russia Republicans. Washington largely treated the Georgia legislator as a joke when she was first elected. Now Greene is threatening the speakership of her party leader, Mike Johnson, if he tries to pass Ukraine funding. Her threat is not empty. Johnson is as keen on remaining speaker as he is lukewarm on Ukraine. His path of least resistance would be to fold. \n\nThat is also the advice that Republican leaders are offering Ukraine in spite of increasingly urgent opposing pleas from allies. Tellingly, Johnson refused to meet Cameron on his latest trip to Washington this week. Donald Trump says that Ukraine should cede the Donbas and Crimea to Russia in exchange for a ceasefire \u2014 an outcome he would impose on day one of his presidency. Some Republicans still want to supply Ukraine with weapons. But they are in a minority. The Republican right treats Ukraine as an enemy and Russia as a friend. Defining that stance as isolationist is lazy and wrong. It is actively pro-Russian. \n\n\u201cThe Ukrainian government is attacking Christians,\u201d says Greene. \u201cThe Ukrainian government is executing priests. Russia is not doing that. They are not attacking Christianity. As a matter of fact they seem to be protecting it.\u201d Michael Whatley, Trump\u2019s handpicked co-chair of the Republican National Committee, openly calls Ukraine an enemy. \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s feckless leadership has shown China, has shown Ukraine, has shown Iran, that they can feel free to be much more aggressive on the world front to the point where even they will try and meddle with our elections here,\u201d he told Fox. \n\nThe Republican right\u2019s pro-Russia interventionism is two-way. As Catherine Belton, author of Putin\u2019s People: How the KGB Took Back Russia and Then Took on the West, reported this week, Russian troll factories are giving Greene\u2019s Republicans their talking points. Ken Buck, one of many Republican legislators to have recently quit politics in despair, calls Greene \u201cMoscow Marjorie\u201d. Her fictional claim that Ukraine is executing priests and fighting to spread a \u201cwoke\u201d agenda comes straight from the Kremlin. Historians compare Trump to Charles Lindbergh\u2019s pro-Nazi \u201cAmerica First\u201d movement in the early 1940s. The difference is that Lindbergh got nowhere near the White House. Far from isolating America, a Trump presidency would switch US foreign policy in Vladimir Putin\u2019s favour.",

But for the long term, of course we shouldn\u2019t be ruling anything out.\u201d\n\nValtonen\u2019s remarks, echoed by leaders and officials in the Baltic states, underscore how Macron has found favour with Nato\u2019s frontline members after his recent pivot on Russia and his warnings that Moscow\u2019s defeat in Ukraine is paramount to Europe\u2019s security.\n\n\nFinland and the Baltic states are also coalescing around traditional French ideas for the EU to play a bigger role in joint military procurement and defence industry collaboration, with a budget to back it up.\n\nMacron has credited Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas for spearheading calls for the EU to issue common debt for defence. Even Finland, a traditional frugal state opposed to EU borrowing, appears to be on board.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything against it,\u201d Valtonen said. \u201cIf we decide that we want to spend \u20ac100bn collectively on ramping up our defence and we want to issue a bond to fund it then it\u2019s got nothing to do with frugality.\u201d",

            "Through comparative historical analysis, we find that Russia\u2019s strategic communications regarding nuclear weapons use in Ukraine broadly reflect Soviet strategy during the Cold War. The Soviet Union employed a combination of aggressive and defensive propaganda narratives regarding nuclear weapons; the former aimed to coerce the West away from interfering in Soviet military interventions abroad, while the latter sought to convince international audiences that the West was primarily to blame for escalations in tensions. Russia continues to employ this same strategy to provide protective cover for its ongoing war on Ukraine. In both cases, actual Soviet and Russian nuclear posture remained significantly less bellicose than its propaganda narratives imply. \n\nOur analysis suggests that Russia\u2019s aggressive rhetoric about nuclear weapons in its war against Ukraine has thus far been primarily intended to shape Western decision-making, rather than a genuine expression of intent to use such weapons. In Ukraine, nuclear \u2018red lines\u2019 advanced by Russian propaganda have consistently been eroded without response, including significant strikes on Crimea, advanced weapons supplied to Ukraine, and the re-taking of illegally annexed territory. Nevertheless, Russia\u2019s nuclear propaganda has been one of its most successful cognitive warfare efforts in limiting or delaying critical Western military support to Ukraine, on the grounds of avoiding potential escalation. While Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal remains a significant threat to Ukraine and the West, an overly cautious response to Russian rhetoric also risks potentially significant geopolitical consequences by tacitly rewarding nuclear threats. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13518046.2023.2297586",

            "Ukrainian forces appear to have repelled a Russian battalion-sized mechanized assault near Avdiivka, Donetsk Oblast, on March 30 \u2014 the first battalion-sized mechanized assault since Russian forces began the campaign to seize Avdiivka in late October 2023. A Ukrainian serviceman reported on March 31 that Russian forces, including elements of the Russian 6th Tank Regiment (90th Tank Division, Central Military District [CMD]), committed 36 tanks and 12 BMP infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) to a large-mechanized assault near Tonenke on March 30.[20] Geolocated imagery published on March 31 shows a large number of destroyed and damaged Russian armored vehicles and tanks along a road northwest of Tonenke (west of Avdiivka).[21] \n\nThe Ukrainian serviceman stated that Ukrainian forces destroyed 12 Russian tanks and eight IFVs during the assault and noted that the frontal assault failed to breakthrough the Ukrainian line. This appears to be the first report of any elements of the 90th Tank Division participating in assaults following the Russian seizure of Avdiivka and ISW previously assessed that elements of the 90th Tank Division, alongside other Russian units and formations, likely represent a sizeable uncommitted operational reserve that the Russian military command can commit to continue and intensify efforts to push west of Avdiivka.[22] The elements of the 6th Tank Regiment appear to have failed in their March 30 attack near Tonenke, however, suggesting that elements of Russia\u2019s uncommitted operational reserve near Avdiivka may be too degraded or otherwise unable to lead further Russian advances westward in the short term.\n\nThe scale of the Russian mechanized assault on March 30 is significant. Russian forces have not conducted a mechanized assault this large since the beginning of the Russian localized offensive effort to seize Avdiivka in late October 2023, when Ukrainian forces reportedly destroyed almost 50 Russian tanks and over 100 armored vehicles on October 19-20, 2023.[23] Ukraine\u2019s ability to defend against the March 30 assault, particularly near Avdiivka where Ukrainian forces have been forced to quickly withdraw to new, defensive positions following the loss of the settlement, is a positive indicator for Ukraine\u2019s ability to defend against future large-scale Russian assaults and the expected summer 2024 Russian offensive operation. \n\nUkrainian officials, justifiably so, continue to warn about Ukraine\u2019s ability to defend against the expected summer Russian offensive effort in the face of ammunition shortages, manpower limitations, and delayed Western assistance.[24] Ukrainian forces may have had to expend a significant amount of material to defend against the Russian assault near Tonenke, highlighting Russia\u2019s ability to conduct assaults that force Ukraine to expend outsized portions of its already limited material and manpower reserves to defend against.[25] Ukraine\u2019s demonstrated ability to skillfully defend against a large-scale Russian assault in a particularly critical part of the front despite Ukraine\u2019s challenges suggests that Ukrainian forces can achieve significant battlefield effects if they are properly equipped.\n\nThe Russian command may be prioritizing the Avdiivka area in Donetsk Oblast. The Russian military command\u2019s willingness to commit a battalion\u2019s worth of tanks to an attack near Avdiivka indicates that this assault was a priority effort. The Russian command may focus their forecasted late spring/summer 2024 offensive operation on western Donetsk Oblast in hopes of building upon Russian forces\u2019 steady but marginal advances in this sector.[26] Ukrainian officials have recently warned that Russian forces are accumulating personnel along the Kharkiv-Luhansk axis, near Bakhmut, near Avdiivka, and in western Zaporizhia Oblast, but ISW continues to assess that Russian forces will likely only be able to launch a concerted large-scale offensive operation in one operational direction at a time due to Russia\u2019s own manpower and planning limitations.[27] \n\n\n\nhttps://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-march-31-2024",

This long-term strategy, if effective, would result in reduced support for Ukraine globally.\n\nAmerican intelligence agencies do not believe the Kremlin has begun its full-bore influence effort. Mr. Putin will probably shift at some point from the anti-Ukraine messaging to influence operations that more directly support the candidacy of former President Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nIn their annual threat assessment, the intelligence agencies said that Russia was trying to sow discord among voters in the United States and its allies around the world, and that the war in Ukraine \u201cwill continue to feature heavily in its messaging.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoscow views U.S. elections as opportunities and has conducted influence operations for decades,\u201d the intelligence report said. \u201cRussia is contemplating how U.S. electoral outcomes in 2024 could impact Western support to Ukraine and probably will attempt to affect the elections in ways that best support its interests and goals.\u201d\n\nhttps://archive.ph/ORFLx",
            "The longer this war lasts, the better Russia will get at learning, adapting, and building a more effective, modern fighting force. Slowly but surely, Moscow will absorb new ideas from the battlefield and rearrange its tactics accordingly. Its strategic adaptation already helped it fend off Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive, and over the last few months it has helped Russian troops take more territory from Kyiv. Ultimately, if Russia\u2019s edge in strategic adaptation persists without an appropriate Western response, the worst that can happen in this war is not stalemate. It is a Ukrainian defeat.\n\nThis should concern western strategists for several reasons.\n\nFirst, and most immediately, a more effective Russian military can be more successful in the offensive operations they are conducting now and over the next few months. This tactical success, as explored earlier, also has strategic impacts for Russia.\n\nSecond, a more effective Russian military is better able to link tactical operations within campaigns and link them to Russian strategy. This was something they were poor at in the first few months of the war for a variety of reasons, including bad assumptions and pure arrogance. But a more effective Russian military has been able to industrialise the war and ensure that it can sustain both the personnel and materiel needs to sustain the war over the medium term. Without an effective western counter, ongoing assistance to Ukraine will be difficult.\n\nThird, a more effective Russian military, which appears to have undertaken reforms in the past 26 months that it should have been undertaking under Gerasimov since 2012, will be an ongoing danger to its neighbours.  And not just European neighbours. We should remember that Russia has a presence in the Pacific (although many of its ground forces have been redeployed to Ukraine).\n\nFinally, a more effective Russian military provides lessons to other predatory authoritarians. In some cases, Russia is probably sharing lessons directly with China, North Korea and Iran in return for dual use technologies and weapons. So, the more military effective Russia gets, the more this has the potential to lift the effectiveness of other potential threats to the west in the medium term.\n\nBesides the moral and strategic imperatives to defend Ukraine and liberate all of its territory taken by Russia since 2014, we must also ensure the defeat of Russia as quickly as possible to deny them more opportunities to learn about modern war and help their strategic partners to do so. All wars are learning opportunities; we must deny this learning to Russia as much as possible: https://mickryan.substack.com/p/russia-advances-in-the-east",

This question was asked on the background of him having been involved in a previous scandal where many (mostly Russian-speaking) footballers posed with head coach of Russia's football team which was considered unethical during Russia's war of aggression.\n\nThis highlights a wide dissonance in the society where most Russian-speakers consider politics to be an isolated topic and do not share concerns for Russia's actions' unacceptability or Russia's ideology being existentially threatening for Baltics. Many of them see the scandals as unfair attacks for a stance for peace. This also means that cohesion with Russian-speakers remains very weak, and with the government soon to be ending Russian-speaking education, it may mean Russian-speakers are on track to face only two options in this country \u2013 assimilation or marginalization.\n\nOn a related note, Estonia's minister of internal affairs says Russian Orthodox Church may be declared a terrorist organization. The Estonian Orthodox Church under Moscow Patriarchate has been under fire for refusing to cut links with Russian Orthodox Church, so this would force them to do so. For background information, Estonian Orthodox Church under Moscow Patriarchate is the biggest religious organization in Estonia, with members outnumbering the formerly dominant Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church (as Estonians are mostly irreligious).

Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksandr Lytvynenko similarly stressed that Russian President Vladimir Putin is \u201caddicted\u201d to the idea conquering Ukraine and will not give up his aims of completely seizing Ukraine and destroying the Ukrainian state.[9] Lytvynenko emphasized the importance of not conceding territory to Putin and ensuring meaningful Western security guarantees for Ukraine to deter future aggression. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-april-15-2024",

These have used long-range drones against oil refineries and other targets with some strategic value in Russia. Ukraine won\u2019t be able to use the long-range ATACMS missiles, or the extra Storm Shadow cruise missiles promised by Sunak in Warsaw this week, to attack targets in Russia proper. However, there are many military-related targets available in occupied Ukrainian territory, including Crimea. \n\nWhile there are no easy ways to bring Russia to its knees, Russian vulnerabilities can be exposed. It will become harder for Vladimir Putin to see how he can bring the war to an early conclusion, which was certainly his hope before the vote in Congress. He might have hoped that the loss of a big city such as Kharkiv would push Ukraine into a downward spiral. Now we return to the prospect of a never-ending war. True, Putin has prepared for this. But the scale of recent Russian losses for limited gains, and the embarrassment of not being able to stop Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, means that he still lacks an obvious route to victory.\n\nEven if Trump wins the presidential election in November, that does not guarantee Putin a satisfactory outcome. Trump will want to push his peace plan but, from what has been reported, Putin will find the details as unacceptable as will Zelenskyy. Having publicly boasted for the past six months that Russia had seized the initiative in the war, Putin must now contemplate the possibility that it might yet again swing towards Ukraine.",

Indeed the larger force has often lost.\n\nThis is because larger numbers of soldiers in and of itself, in industrial and modern warfare, tells you relatively little about the effectiveness of a military force. Its not the numbers of raw soldiers that matters\u2014its having the right number of soldiers for the equipment you have, training them to use the equipment properly, and motivating and supplying them in the field once they are trained. And finally its about providing the right support\u2014such as air power. https://phillipspobrien.substack.com/p/numbers-of-soldiers-does-not-win",

Russian Telegram channels confirmed the loss.\n\nIf Ukraine did hit Kovrovets with ATACMS, it could mean two things. First, Ukraine has gotten 170-mile M48 or 190-mile M57 ATACMS with 470-pound warheads in addition to getting M39 and M39A1 ATACMs with submunitions.\n\nSecond, the M48 and M57 are more accurate than many observers assumed.\n\nThe implications are enormous. For starters, what remains of the Black Sea Fleet that\u2019s still anchoring at Sevastopol, well within range of the M39A1, M48 and M57, is in big trouble. \u201cIf ATACMS are taking out Russian warships in Sevastopol, hard to see the base having much utility left for the Russians,\u201d pointed out Phillips O\u2019Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\n\nAfter all, the frequently-damaged S-400 long-range air defense battery that protects Sevastopol and nearby Belbek air base hasn\u2019t been able to intercept incoming ATACMS. \u201cRussians have almost no capability to deal with them,\u201d noted Nuno Felix, a Portuguese military consultant.\n\nEqually troubling for the Russians, accurate ATACMS with unitary warheads could represent a serious danger to the Kerch Bridge, which connects southern Russia to occupied Crimea.

            "Selling more oil at higher prices ought to be the stuff of dreams for a petrostate. But for Russia it is a sign of a new, punishing phase in its war with Ukraine. Months of Ukrainian drone strikes on refineries have crimped Russia\u2019s ability to produce refined fuels, such as diesel and petrol, and turned the world\u2019s third-largest oil producer into an importer of petrol. Energy firms have tried to pare their losses by selling unrefined oil overseas, pushing exports to a ten-month high in March.\n\nIn Ukraine\u2019s most recent attack on April 2nd, its planners extended their reach. They managed to land explosives on a refinery 1,115km from the border. Their attack set fire to a unit responsible for 3% of Russia\u2019s refining capacity. Although it left no lasting damage, others have been more successful. All told, Ukraine\u2019s barrage has knocked out a seventh of Russian refining capacity, according to S&P Global, a data firm. Maintenance work and flooding in the city of Orsk on April 8th has taken more capacity offline. Wholesale prices on the St Petersburg International Mercantile Exchange have spiked. Ukraine, which has itself been the target of strikes on energy infrastructure, hopes the assaults will slow the flow of dollars into its enemy\u2019s war machine and dent support for the war.\n\nRussia\u2019s oil giants are suffering the most. Refineries that normally produce petrol and diesel for overseas clients at a premium have been diverted to domestic production. The volume of diesel due to pass out of Russian ports has hit a five-month low. At the same time, oil barons are seeking new customers for their excess crude, on which they will stomach losses of $15 or so for every barrel that could have been exported as a refined product, says Sergey Vakulenko, a former oil executive.\n\nAlthough Ukraine\u2019s attacks have slowed since Vladimir Putin\u2019s re-election in March, Ukraine has given no indication that they will stop. It can lob drones faster and more cheaply than Russia can repair its refineries. Some facilities, like the NORSI refinery in the city of Nizhny Novgorod, have been particularly slow and expensive to fix, in part because access to equipment is stymied by Western sanctions. As of this month, Russian oil producers must also reduce the amount they pump from the ground by about 5% as part of a production cap agreed with OPEC+, an oil cartel.\n\nMotorists have so far been shielded from Ukraine-inflicted \u201cunplanned maintenance\u201d (as Russia\u2019s energy ministry puts it). The government has kept a lid on prices by banning petrol exports for six months from March 1st, and striking a deal with Belarus, its client state. Russia imported 3,000 tonnes of fuel from Belarus in the first half of March, up from zero in January. Fearing that may not be enough, officials have also asked neighbouring Kazakhstan to set aside a third of its reserves, equivalent to 100,000 tonnes, should Russia need them, according to Reuters. If attacks continue, they could start to push up prices.\n\nThe consequences for Russia\u2019s public finances should be limited, even though oil revenues represent 34% of its budget. Rosneft, the state oil company, will dispense a smaller dividend if it cannot make up its lost revenues, but many doubt these dividends make it to state coffers at all. The government will even save some cash by paying out fewer per-barrel subsidies to refineries. Russia\u2019s biggest money-earners are resource taxes. And because these are levied as royalties at the well-head, the government is indifferent between oil exported as crude or as refined fuel, says Mr Vakulenko. As long as Russia is able to export crude, it can collect royalties.\n\nObservers outside Russia are watching to see if Ukraine\u2019s attacks will affect the global oil market. They have yet to have much impact, but the price of Brent crude has risen by 19% this year to just under $90 a barrel, owing to OPEC+ supply curbs, better-than-expected global economic conditions and disruptions in the Red Sea. Few observers have more at stake than Joe Biden, who faces an election in November. His administration has urged Ukraine to halt its attacks, fearing they will provoke tough retaliation from Russia and drive petrol prices higher. Ukraine\u2019s leaders are willing to take the risk. \u25a0 https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/04/11/ukrainian-drone-strikes-are-hurting-russias-oil-industry",

America is planning to send $61bn to Ukraine in total. The vast majority of that will be spent on lethal aid by replenishing American military stockpiles, allowing more to be given away, and procuring new weapons and ammunition from American arms firms. The first priority is desperately needed shells. An American three-star general has already been assigned the job of organising arms deliveries, subject to the vote. The Pentagon should be able to start getting shells to Ukraine within two weeks, reckons Michael Kofman of the Carnegie Endowment, a think-tank, and can supply enough to last for a year or so. Larger weapons systems will take much longer to ship; some still need to be ordered, let alone manufactured. The hope is that it will be enough to fend off a larger-scale Russian offensive that Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine\u2019s military-intelligence service, has said he expects in June.\n\nUkraine has other looming problems, though. Its stock of air-defence interceptor missiles, fired from a mix of American, European and Soviet-era launchers, has dwindled. Russian attack jets have recently been providing close air support to troops with seemingly little risk of being shot down. America\u2019s Patriot missile-defence systems are in high demand elsewhere, including Israel, and production is low. At the same time, Russia is deploying effective new weapons. On April 11th it successfully launched an attack on a thermal power station in Kyiv using a Kh-69 stealth cruise missile that eluded a Patriot interceptor. Even with enough kit, Ukraine confronts a serious manpower disadvantage compared with Russia. This month Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, reduced the age for conscription to the armed forces to 25 despite the considerable unpopularity of that measure. https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/04/20/the-house-of-representatives-just-gave-ukraine-the-best-news-it-has-had-for-a-year",

            "Ukraine\u2019s Security Service (SBU) and Ukrainian forces reportedly conducted one of the largest series of drone strikes against military facilities within Russia, targeting at least four Russian airbases, on the night of April 4 to 5. Ukrainian media reported that sources within Ukrainian security services, including the Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR), stated that the SBU and Ukrainian forces conducted successful strikes on airfields near Kursk City and Yeysk, Krasnodar Krai; the Engels Airbase in Saratov Oblast; and the Morozovsk Airbase in Rostov Oblast.[1] These Ukrainian security sources reportedly stated that the Ukrainian drone strikes significantly damaged three Tu-95MS strategic bombers at Engels airbase, damaged two Su-25 fixed-wing aircraft at the airbase near Yeysk, and destroyed six unidentified aircraft and significantly damaged another eight unidentified aircraft at the Morozovsk Airbase.[2] \n\nThe Ukrainian strikes reportedly killed four Russian military personnel at the airbase near Yeysk and seven Russian personnel at the Engels Airbase and wounded and killed up to 20 Russian personnel at the Morozovsk Airbase.[3] Geolocated footage shows explosions and Russian air defenses activating near all the airbases except for the one near Yeysk.[4] ISW has not yet observed any visual confirmation that Ukrainian forces damaged or destroyed aircraft or infrastructure at any of the airbases. Satellite imagery collected on April 4 indicates that there were three Tu-160 heavy strategic bombers, five Tu-95 strategic bombers, an Il-76 transport aircraft, and a Tu-22 bomber at Engels Airbase; ten L-39 training and combat aircraft, five An-26 transport aircraft, an An-74 transport aircraft, an An-12 transport aircraft, four Su-27 fixed-winged aircraft, four Su-25 fixed-wing aircraft, one Su-30 fixed-wing aircraft, and several Ka-52 and Mi-8 helicopters at the Yeysk Airbase; and 29 fixed-wing aircraft, primarily Su-34s, at the Morozovsk airfield.[5] \n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Russian forces intercepted 44 drones over Rostov Oblast, six drones over Krasnodar Krai, and a drone each in Saratov, Kursk, and Belgorod oblasts on the night of April 4 and into the morning on April 5.[6] Ukrainian drone strikes have typically only targeted individual airbases within Russia, and Ukraine\u2019s ability to strike four separate airbases in one strike series represents a notable inflection in the capabilities that Ukrainian forces are employing in their campaign against Russian military infrastructure, critical infrastructure, and strategic industries within Russia.\n\nISW continues to assess that Ukrainian strikes against targets within Russia are a necessary component of Ukraine\u2019s campaign to degrade industries that support the Russian war effort and military capabilities deployed in the Russian rear through asymmetric means. Russian forces routinely use Tu-95 strategic bombers stationed at Engels Airbase to launch Kh-101/Kh-555 cruise missiles at targets in Ukraine, and the Russian military had roughly 60 Tu-95 aircraft as of 2023.[7] If confirmed, the possible loss of roughly five percent of Russia\u2019s strategic Tu-95 bombers in a single strike would be notable. ISW has also previously observed that the loss of fixed-wing aircraft is not negligible since Russia likely has about 300 various Sukhoi fixed-wing aircraft.[8] Russian forces are currently using Sukhoi fixed-wing aircraft to conduct guided and unguided glide bomb strikes along the entire frontline in Ukraine and have previously leveraged significantly intensified glide bomb strikes to make tactical gains.[9] Sustained Ukrainian strikes against Russian airfields within Russia will degrade the Russian Aerospace Force\u2019s (VKS) ability to conduct missile and air strikes throughout Ukraine. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-april-5-2024",

            "Western media continues to report that Russian President Vladimir Putin is interested in a negotiated ceasefire in Ukraine, although Kremlin rhetoric and Russian military actions illustrate that Putin remains uninterested in meaningful negotiations and any settlement that would prevent him from pursuing the destruction of an independent Ukrainian state.\n\nRussian sources that have spoken to Western media have also offered mutually contradictory characterizations of Putin's stance on negotiations.\nThese Russian sources notably highlighted territorial concessions as part of Putin's alleged envisioned ceasefire but have sparsely addressed the wider strategic objectives of Putin's war in Ukraine.\n\nA ceasefire does not preclude Russia from resuming its offensive campaign to destroy Ukrainian statehood, and Russia would use any ceasefire to prepare for future offensive operations within Ukraine.\nRussia is currently preparing for the possibility of a conventional war with NATO, and the Kremlin will likely view anything short of Ukrainian capitulation as an existential threat to Russia's ability to fight such a war.\n\nThe Kremlin will continue to feign interest in negotiations at critical moments in the war to influence Western decision-making on support for Ukraine and to continue efforts to extract preemptive concessions from the West. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-may-24-2024",

Russia is not invited to the conference and Putin\u2019s remarks on Friday are likely to have been timed as a spoiler to that summit.\n\n> [...]\n\n>Putin demanded that Ukrainian troops leave the entire regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia and that they be declared Russian territory by international agreement, calling the issue \u201cclosed\u201d for Russia.\n\n> \u201cAs soon as Kyiv says it is ready to make this decision, begins the actual pull-out of forces from those regions and formally declares the abandonment of its plans to join Nato, we will instantly, that very second, order a ceasefire and begin negotiations,\u201d Putin said.\n\n> He also demanded that the west drop all financial sanctions against Russia as a precondition to a ceasefire.\n\nLet's first notice it was said by Putin himself, not some henchman. Apparently an unprompted declaration too, not just answering a question from the press. The terms he's proposing are utterly unrealistic, so what's the actual purpose of this stunt?\n\nI guess he's hurting from the recent sanctions and sneers towards Switzerland growling threateningly.

            "Russian here.\n\nIt was definitely one of the weirdest mutinies in history, but I don't think he could have succeeded anyway.\n\nFirst, he didn't have any political support from any of the ruling elite. You need to remember he had 13 years' imprisonment under articles of  \"theft\", \"robbery\", \"fraud\" and \"involving a minor in the commission of a crime. Then he worked for Putin organizing mercenaries in Africa. So while being a Putin loyalist he was a complete outsider to the ruling circle, and they sure wouldn't want to let him in. Especially if they are already satisfied with Putin's system, there is zero reason to let in an outsider bandit and a mercenary.\n\nSecond, he never had any political program for his coup attempt. It wasn't \"I'll be the new president\", it was \"I'll march towards Moscow to let Putin know my dissatisfaction with undersupplying Wagner\". And the reason Wagner started getting undersupplied is the same as always - they were getting too powerful and too influential.\n\nThe whole of Putin's rule has been \"divide and conquer\" - making sure that different government departments compete against each other without having any of them dominant. Regular military vs Wagner was one of those things. And as you can see, when Wagner was done and only the regular military was left, what did Putin do? That's right, he removed the minister of defense Shoigu (despite him being one of Putin's closest allies), and cleansed all Shoigu's people from the MoD. Same principle again - no one can be allowed to get too powerful.\n\nSo essentially Prigozhin was marching on Moscow alone, without any political support, or a political program that could attract more supporters - and not being a politician himself. He was relying on the Z-circles, but those were also getting repressed by Putin to stop them from growing too powerful. Even if he took the Kremlin or the White House, I don't think he would be able to do anything.",

The man's clearly talented in a very entrepreneurial type of way. \n\nHe went from child of intellectuals to criminal to prisoner to running an illegal industry in a prison to shitty car dealer to hotdog seller to supermarket investor to restanteur to professional internet trollmaster to unwilling leader of a fake mercenary leader to enthusiastic leader of a real mercenary group to rebel\n\nAt the same time, in addition to the personal characteristics of Prigozhin, his journey is kind of emblamatic of the \"upper rung but not inner circle\" class of Russians. The people with actual power are free to use him as much as they want, and punish him pretty much however they want. But no matter how hard he worked he could never join that upper rung.

            "1. I would say the general population was curious, but mostly indifferent to Prigozhin\u2019s mutiny. It\u2019s not like  he was in any shape or form an attractive alternative to Putin (save maybe for a small number of war hawks). So I don\u2019t think that would change. Besides, even if he took the Kremlin - he had zero support from the political elites, or the main army, or the special services. It\u2019s not like taking Kremlin makes you the rules of Russia. So I think he would have been eliminated in a siege in that case without much popular support. \n\n2. He didn\u2019t view it as a coup. If you read his messages during the coup, they were all along the lines of \u201cI need to get to Putin to make him understand me\u201d, and never \u201cwe will overthrow Putin\u201d. \n\n I think that\u2019s the issue - he was getting more and more frustrated with Wagner getting less and less supplies, and assumed that was the minister of defense that made Putin redirect the supplies to the regular military. And then either because of lack or thinking or some emotional instability (which you could clearly see in his videos, how easily Prigozhin got triggered) he decided to march on Moscow and draw Putin\u2019s attention.",
            "It did feel huge indeed, but in terms of consequences, I wouldn't say it had that much of an impact. Wagner got disbanded and cleansed, and all the military power went to the Ministry of Defense. Which ironically also got cleansed right after Putin's re-election.

At some point Wagner (likely primarily convicts) were dropping like flies and dying horrible deaths. It must take heavy psychological toll on every human being (bar psychopaths). Especially when you orchestrate it all.\n\nOther thing I wonder is Wagner running it's own social media ops. They did a lot of it. Prigozhin and top Wagner circle likely got high exposure to foreign material and a vision of war far distant from Kremlin's one. Social media can also easily exacerbate mental health problems.\n\nWhat shocks me is the scale of \"good tsar, bad boyars\" thinking on his part.

            ">I would have expected someone in Prigozhin's position to know better\n\n  \nI don't think so. Imagine you are Prigozhin. You have been a Putin loyalist since 2000, and Putin has been very loyal to you. Huge government contracts for catering, your own PMC that is one of the richest PMCs in the world, conducting military operations in Africa to further Putin's interests, and so on.\n\nThe war with Ukraine starts, and you get sent to the frontlines with your PMC, you get first priority supplies support.\n\nAnd then, as the war goes on, you are suddenly getting less and less supplies. You look around and notice that the regular army started getting more supplies. You try calling Putin, but he won't talk to you. Considering Putin has been on your side for 20 years, what are your first thoughts? That there is some conspiracy against you led by the Minister of Defense that Putin started believing in. So you need to get to Putin at any cost to let him know what is going on.\n\nAt least that's the most plausible logic I can think of.",
            "It could be an act of despair. He did sound a bit unstable in his late public voice and video messages, and the vision of the war he translated was, in fact,  very different from official Russian propaganda.\n\nBefore the mutiny,  Prigozhin's position was rapidly getting worse and worse. Not only Wagner had reduced supplies,  but also banned from recruiting convicts and from retreating. Prigozhin was also cut from the Kremlin hotline and was ordered to make all his mercenaries sign a contract with MoD, essentially giving them to Shoigu.\n\nHe wouldn't last much longer in Ukraine, and he understood it.",
            "So far, it doesn't look like there will be significant consequences. It's pretty normal for Putin to reshuffle people seemingly at random,  but he paused it for 2 years when the invasion began.\n\nShort-term, it will reduce the efficiency of MoD as the new leadership will need some time to reestablish all the connections. Long-term, we don't know yet, but the new assignments are the same old bunch of incompetent,  corrupt mix of cronism and nepotism we see everywhere in the Russian government.",
            "The consequences are simple:\n\nFirst, not let anyone amass too much power, as the previous minister of defense Shoigu did.   \nSecond, the new minster of defense is a former economist, with a reputation of being a rather low-corruption official.  \n I think what we can derive from that is that Putin expects the war to go on for a while, and the military economics and the functioning of the Ministry of Defense as a whole is currently his priority.",

            "I feel sadness and shame for this, we have a huge problem with worker rights in agriculture and yet people fail to understand that if you want your veggies to be grown in Italy and, at the same time, you want them to only cost 0,10\u20ac per kg, this is how those veggies make it to your plate.",
            "Did the employer have a plan what to do with the body? I can't believe they thought that nobody would notice anything.",
            "That's extremely cruel, he could have survived. Good that the local community, trade unions, and also Meloni's reactions show that this is unacceptable",
            "Here comes the comment from accounts named [adjective]_ [noun]_[number] that are barely a few days or weeks old saying horrible shit about immigration, completely ignoring the topic at hand",
            "These fucking immigrants just cant stop living off welfare cant they? /s\n\nYou can bet this headline wont get NEARLY as much cover compared to when some immigrant commits a crime.",
            "Saw that in the news today here in Australia. That's pretty fucked up to just dump him on the side of the road.",
            "They could literally fine every farm in Italy, because almost everyone there works without a regular contract, while being an illegal immigrant.\n\nUnfortunately, this makes the news only when something terrible happens.\n\nSame as everything regarding work in Italy.",
            "What a disgusting disregard for human life. \n\nTo dump him on the side of the road when he could have survived with immediate medical attention.\n\nSo young too. Really, really sad.",
            "Barbarians are within UE borders, i dont know why people fear imigration so much if these are our compatriots...\n\nPlus actually imigrarion is made by those who run these bussiness with a high exploitation rate and at the end of the day much of the inflation is greedflation as supermarkets are driving their proffits margins up as several international institutions have indicated.",
            "Right wing and the government are doing all they can to sweep this under the rug: minister Lollobrigida, Meloni's brother in law, said it's just a bad apple, nothing to see here. Alle the right wing media are just blatantly ignoring this. Not a word.",
            "This is one of the hundreds of work related deaths each year, we have more deaths than the US, also workers usually get paid 5 euros or less, italy is no longer a place for young people to live unfortunately",

            "Ilaria Salis, self-proclaimed justice warrior should be sent to deal with the farmers here, with a hammer and a screwdriver.\n\n\nEdit: that's what she does, and she was elected as a MEP as a result, so I thought Italians think this is the way to solve problems",
            "It really is. We see citizens complain about how much their veggies cost have gone up in tv, without having a clue of how much labor would cost to produce legally the same produce. \n\nI had friends picking apples and strawberries in Trentino during the summer, decades ago. Their conditions were absolutely humane, and legal, and still they were like \u201cI\u2019m never gonna do this work again in my whole life\u201d. It\u2019s really hard work, and doing it at 40 degrees, for little money and no insurance is wild.",
            "Not to mention that farmers in the west are possibly single-handedly responsible for our birth numbers not being complete shite. The flipside to that is that they're literally having kids in order to have legal child labor in the farms, it's kinda crazy",
            "If everyone's salary would rise, price would be higher, but so would income.\n\nInstead now we can have a 10 euro liter bottle of oil with a salary of 1k a month.\n\nThe solution is not having slaves working, is paying everyone a living wage.\n\nEdit: the price of things is 90% markup on transport, distribution, etc.",
            "That\u2019s the thing that always makes me laugh about it all. The consumer drives this trend towards lower prices as they will usually go for the cheaper option. It\u2019s the circle of consumerism.",
            "Maybe the issue is that produce can't be this cheap unless you have a lot of slaves working in the fields.\n\nAll the anti immigration propaganda isn't aimed at stopping immigration, it's to prevent immigrants from having any sympathy from the locals so they can't ask for rights and be exploited without consequences.",
            "we have huge problems with worker rights ~~in agricolture~~  everywhere, thats why more than 1m people under 30 emigrated between 2012-2022",

            ">Singh was then loaded into a van and abandoned near his home, while his severed arm was left in a vegetable collection box\n\nI think the employer just didn't care.",
            "The employer hired him without a contract, he tried to get rid of him because he would be fined for allowing a worker without a regular contract. However he wasn\u2019t clever enough to think that a deadly injure would cause much more problem for his activity which will probably be seized",
            "Employers dont care about their workers, as much emperors dont care about their slaves, its only one of the numerous deaths related to employers being pieces of shit protected from the government",

            "Totally unrelated to Meloni.\n\nThe human exploitation for farm-workers has deep roots.\n\nIt is something we cannot tollerate both as a nation and most of all as humans.\n\nCapitalism and human greed is the cause.",
            "Yup, Meloni gets elected and voila! Farm machinery malfunctions, cuts a guy's arm and a shitty Italian hominid ignores the gravity of the accident. Coincident?\n\n\nI'm sure that farmer would have spent his entire fortune to save the Indian fella, but only if commies were in power.  \n\n\nAs a side note: take off those political blinders, and try think for once.",

            "The concept is fine. The reality is not all jobs are viable at certain price points.\n\nWhile your or my job might rise with inflation, many will just be unviable, which is actually fine as well. The issue is when depression of wages of essential services by government ideology comes in to play so only the wealthy can have a good standard of life.",
            "It's worse: the employer took all the workers phones so they couldn't call for help. IMHO this is murder, not manslaughter.",
            "\u201cFined\u201d\n\nThey would probably, and rightly, go to jail for it.",

            "Nah, I\u2019m no bot and I don\u2019t work for anyone. And I only say the truth about the migrants and the havoc they are wreaking here in Europe.",

            "It's not a shortage. It's the farmers who want to pay misery and exploit immigrants to have cheap labour.\n\nBelieve me that if you pay decent wages you find qualified workers.",
            "You would think a shortage would ensure better working conditions for workers. \n\nI don't think what you say is true at all.",
            "I watched an interview with a lady who was a slave at one of such farms. It's unreal that someone could do something like this to other humans. And to think that everyone around knew and yet did nothing. She said that people from the nearby village would even visit them while they worked in the fields and talked with them yet never offered to help even though they knew that they are slaves. She even described how one guy tried escaping but the police caught him and brought him back so that the owner of the estate could punish him for escaping by shooting him in the knee. Like how is this normal? How is it possible that according to that modern slavery watch organisation (can't remember the actual name) there are more slaves alive now than ever before? And supposedly this is the best that humanity can be...",

            "Because those works are managed by the local mafia who get all the profits while salary in Italy struggle to go up in decades. Btw it is called coporalato in Italy and they pay even less once some of those workers go away, there is a long queue of immigrants ready to let themselves be used and abuse in order to feed their children. Sad reality.",
            "Farming relies on energy and fertilizer. Russia is a major exporter of both.",

            "I deleted my original account here on reddit and on other forums and social media because I had been an idiot in 2001 and till 2017 used the same nickname everywhere.  It started when groups of radicalized posters on two forums I was member of (a conservative-liberal forum with a secret conspiring fascist group wanting to kill anyone not a fascist and a liberal-socialist forum with an openly conspiring tankie/stalinist/maoist group wanting to ostracize the non-Marxist-Leninists...I am an Anarchist, fuck ML's) started organizing, respectively, the doxxing-followed by-swatting (the fascists) or one's mass-cancelling by cross referencing posts from other sites posters with same nicknames said years ago at the age of 15 or less (the tankies).\n\nBasically that was the wake up call for me that the internet just became as dangerous as from a Black Mirror episode and I started deleting all my childhood online and social media accounts and making new emails for making new non-connectable random name accounts. \n\nLike this one.",
            "So this guy was wreaking havoc by making sure that you can afford vegetables in the supermarket. Others wreak havoc by ensuring that your gran doesn't die alone in a hospital corridor. Some of them wreak havoc by constructing roads and buildings that you use every day.\n\nYou want to see havoc? Remove migrant labour from Europe for, let's say 30 minutes. You have no idea how unaffordable your lifestyle is in the real world economy. Childish, spoilt little culture warriors.\n\nFirst show me the sacrifices you're willing to make in your material life and then we'll talk about persecuting migrants.",
            "Hey guys, found one!",
            "See when you have genuine concerns about it you regulate it, instead a lot of people are dog whistling the immigrant angle which is creating gaps in the system that is letting these incidents happen.",
            "So cute, it only took one comment to get him to call me a russian bot.",
            "The prices of products also quadruple and people won't want that. Hence the issue isn't it.",
            "Italians don\u2019t want to do this work (several countries have a similar problem) and the industry is dependent on seasonal migrants workers. The exploitation of migrants workers in that sector isn\u2019t new.\u00a0",

The issue is not with the user names but with  1 week at most old accounts mass posting or reporting,  I have same username on all my accounts, KGB has better things to do then visiting at my home or sending me some package (I am not LGBTQ so I am not a priority for them)",
            "LMAO get a load of this. So you admit that importing tons of immigrants lowers the price of labor and thus goods of services, but if I tell you that same factor also keeps wages low, rent prices high (along with demand for housing), you'll foam at the mouth. You realize that much of Europe existed just fine without this mass of migrants available to pick berries and pave roads as little as a decade or two ago, right?",
            "No you didn\u2019t and that\u2019s just not how it works. You really think that the right ground in Europe is because of foreign propaganda? Look it the fucking mirror and you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s the liberal parties\u2019 fault that the right is on the rise. I used to vote more left until I saw that they have absolutely no idea what they\u2019re doing",
            "Of course, but the solution cannot be to have slavery lol",
            "Nope, it's mostly greed by employers who want insane profit margins. Technological advancement should have stopped this problem a while ago but the contradictory mode of production promotes lazy solutions (cheap foreign labor) and stifles actual innovation.",
            "So how did these crops get farmed for hundreds of years before if Italians don't want to do this work? If they raise salaries people will flock to this kind of work.",
            "Italians don't want to be slaves for 3 euros an hour. It's different.\n\nAlso, illegal \"seasonal workers\" living in a corrugated iron hut of 5 square meters is not the solution to the problem.",
            "I think this might be better in Italy now since the stories I heard about the situation there are from decades ago but it is very much still a problem elsewhere, especially UK for some reason. It's scary that someone you know can be effectively a slave and you wouldn't know. Not all of those people work in fields, some go to normal jobs but have their passports taken away and the person who takes them to and from work steals their paychecks.\n\nhttps://www.antislavery.org/slavery-today/spot-the-signs-of-slavery/\nI wanted to find the site where I first read a about it but is seems like it has gotten worse since there's like fifty articles and organisations dedicated to fighting it now (of course I am happy that they are fighting it, just sad to see that it is necessary in the first place)",
            "It's an interview but it's in polish. I can link it but it won't be of much use for you. I don't think that it's too far fetched since same things are mentioned by other people who were trapped in such places. It's also worth mentioning that this was around early 2000s.",
            "Praise be to u/Octavian_96 for he saw the obvious coming unlike us fools",
            "I am not sure if you got what I wrote because we are basically saying the same thing. In my first comment I tried to envision why the employer tried to get rid of him, however I also said that the employer was not clever because an illegal worker fine can be dealt with but in this particular case a deadly injury was in the picture. Not only the employer will be fined for the illegal worker but also charged for failure to assist an injured  employee and  for manslaughter.",
            "Rent prices are high because govts are underspending on infrastructure. The issue is good regulatory system for immigrants. Full scale ban will lead to more and more incidents like these where they are smuggled to work like a slave.",
            "Yes and what changed? We all wanted new cars, meat 7 times a week, imported vegetables, holidays abroad. We cannot actually afford any of those things. If you want to remove immigration then you first have to fix our consumption habits.\n\nThat would of course make our economies collapse to the level of those countries. We need to wake up to the fact that we live in fantasy land and immigration is the only thing sustaining it.\n\nEdit: Germany becoming a manufacturing powerhouse and giving nice comfortable lives to all its citizens *coincidentally* followed a massive influx of Turkish workers, which those comfortable Germans then complained about.\n\nEdit 2: The fact is me and you probably would agree on an awful lot about what is wrong with the situation in the West, I just don't think that the responsibility lies with people brought over here to work. We let corporations and advertisers completely reshape our society in order that they could off-shore the profits and keep the masses nice and comfy on the sofa while this poor bastard gets his arm chopped off.",
            "The Europe that existed is not the Europe you have now. You have a bunch of old people. You have the biggest social safety nets in the world. As a young person you must be willing to work yourself to a husk for old people with minimal benefit to yourself. Then you can talk about getting rid of immigrants.\n\nSo answer the question. How bad are you willing for your lifestyle to get in order to get rid of them? Don't be a coward.",
            "First of all, it was a shitty joke. Second, yes, partially it is influenced by foreign propaganda and money. Third if you think people who blame everything on immigrants and gays will solve anything when they get in power then you are simply naive.",
            "Of course not. But who will regulate the farmers? Most of the public usually stay silent about these things.",
            "Yeah that is the logical step I know but how do reckon it will get changed? Just few months ago farmers were on the streets protesting against environmental regulation.",
            "Dear god this is depressing. Most of these are developed countries.",
            "Govts underspending on infrastructure is a fancier way of saying it's importing more people than it can reasonably house. Incidents such as these are tragic, and more stringent oversight might not stop them all from happening, but they are likely to prevent a lot more than they would encourage them to happen, if done right.",
            "Ah, next scapegoat in the cross-hair. Old dudes. Call'em boomers and already they feel less human.\nNow make young people feel like they're victims of the evil boomer subspecies and... what? \nAnswer the question. Where exactly do you want to go with this, Hot_Exitement? Don't be a coward.",
            "You are succumbing to the logic of greedy corpos into applying the same \"infinite growth\" logic of capitalism to demographics which is utterly unsustainable in both areas.\n\nPopulations scale down, and the economy must adjust accordingly. You may say that a drop in fertility rates means fewer people to work and pay pensions for the elderly but consider that it also means lower demand for housing, lower demand for goods, services, etc as well. You cannot have infinite growth, what's wrong with scaling down? \n\nSecond, states have WAY more money than you think they do, especially these strong welfare states that attract the most immigrants. The notion that they would \"run out of money\" to pay pensions for the elderly without bringing immigrants in (which require housing, training, etc) is preposterous. They have the highest tax rates & VAT and overall do a good job at taxing corpos to bring plenty of revenue for the state budgets. They are doing a fantastic job keeping hundreds of thousands of refugees (do not confuse these for EU and non-EU workers) perpetually unemployed, housed, and on welfare just fine, they can't do the same for people who have worked and paid taxes for decades?\n\n>So answer the question. How bad are you willing for your lifestyle to get in order to get rid of them? Don't be a coward.\n\nAgain, what lifestyle? For the average Joe Schmoe, the lifestyle has only gotten worse, not better. I'm not benefitting anything if indians flock to pick berries for bare minimum wage, the employers are, as well as the landlords who overfill their houses with these workers.",
            "Hey, I said nothing about homosexuals. And no one who votes right believes that everything will be solved. We\u2019re just pissed that everyone who says that it is ONE of the problems is instantly seen as a fascist and that people who vote left just look away and don\u2019t want to even acknowledge the fact that it is a problem. That\u2019s what pisses me off!",
            "It's not a scapegoat. It's a fact. Europeans live very long lives. You don't have that many children. You have the biggest welfare states in the world. I'm fine with you getting rid of immigrants. \n\nJust acknowledge the work you'll have to do and start doing it. That is my point. If you don't do this , changes might be easily overturned because people didn't expect their lifestyle to be affected so much. Tell them the whole truth before hand and that reduces the chance of this happening.",
            "I don't care about infinite growth. Just inform people about the consequences of removing the duct tape that is immigrants.
