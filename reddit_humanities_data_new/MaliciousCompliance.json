        "content": "Very minor and petty but funny.  \nWorking at a super fancy high-end restaurant in fine dining, the level of communication between the front-end staff (bartenders, servers, assistants, food runners, etc) is incredible. We want everything that is needed to come to the table at the same time, and we don't want to ask a guest the same question twice.\n\nFor example with beverages, if a table is drinking all kinds of various beverages and you happen to walk by and notice one is low, the correct course of action is actually to not go up to the guest to ask if they'd like another because at that point you don't know what they're having. The guest has already told the establishment what they're having so going up and saying \"what did you have again\" detracts from the experience. I know this seems minor but the correct course is to find the assistant, or the server, or pull up the table in the POS and see, so that when you do go up and ask the correct questions, \"would you like another Old Fashioned with extra <blah blah blah>\" or whatever, specifically naming the drink and modifications.\n\nThe same can happen even for a side of ketchup or aioli. The basic process will be, \"was it supposed to come with it and kitchen/expo forgot to put in on the plate?\", or, \"did the guest ask for it and the server forgot to add it in there\", or, \"did the guest just decide to order it later and we just need it asap\".\n\nNormally when the food is dropped off the person in charge is supposed to ask if everything looks okay and if they can bring anything else.\n\nEnter our guest Bob.\n\nBob has already been asking for his water and tea to be refilled when it was still above the threshold for us noticing it (when it was like 70-80% full), and would flag down multiple people until it got refilled. No big deal, one assistant would grab a pitcher and refill, while another assistant would grab another pitcher and see that the glass was full and just walk away. Same thing for lemons. This became annoying.\n\nBob sees his steak and fries which came with an aioli (as shown on the menu) but he wants ketchup. No big deal. Small request. He asks the person dropping off the food. It is communicated and noted and will be out shortly. Next, the assistant comes to offer beverage refills. Bob asks for ketchup. It is noted. Next, the server does a visual quality check and Bob asks for ketchup. You can see where this is going. This all happens in less than 2 minutes if that long. Bob ended up asking 4 separate people for ketchup, and given the urgency of bringing out a side after food has arrived, all 4 people end up congregating in the service area to put tiny little porcelain ketchup pour cups onto silver serving dishes. Now each one of those cups is designed to be shared by 2 people. So, the conversation begins,\n\n* Food runner: hey, what are you guys up to? I'm grabbing that ketchup for Table 12 Seat 2\n* Server Assistant: oh, that's funny, I was also going to grab a ketchup for #12 seat 2\n* Server: funny, they asked me for it too and I was running over here to grab it\n* Another server: oh hey I got flagged down by Table 12 to grab a ketchup\n\nso.... enough is enough.. the guy clearly wants ketchup....\n\nWe decided all of us would give the guest exactly he asked for. So, in all glory, all 4 of us come back out with our silver serving trays and everything, one at a time, each giant silver serving tray holding just a single side of ketchup, dropping off 4 separate ketchup dishes, 15 seconds apart. Bob realized what he did once he got enough ketchup for 8 people. We left all the ketchups just sitting there throughout the entree course. Of course this was not unnoticed by other guests who very humorously asked funny questions and if that's how Bob eats his steak. We made sure that the ketchups were the very last things off the table before it was time for dessert. He barely used a single one.\n\nAt the end of the day Bob did not leave hungry, the guests were not un-entertained, and neither were we.\n\nTLDR; guy asked 4 separate people for ketchup, all 4 people brought out a side of ketchup, one after another. Bob got 8 people's worth of ketchup.\n\n\\[edit\\] grammar, details",

A simple side of ketchup or sour cream or whatever, whether expected or not, can take higher priority than most other things as not having it is actively preventing the guest from eating the food which is getting cold. This is why in this case each and every person went directly to grab it themselves regardless of their role, who has the table, etc.",
            "I mean this is a MaliciousCompliance sub after all... but let's explore....\n\nThe food runner came from the kitchen, received the request, acknowledged it, and went to go get it.  \nIn the meantime the server assistant was just filling up waters in the section and visited the table next. Does that mean the assistant can't go back to the table to fill up waters until the ketchup has arrived? The runner is already running it. The waters are unrelated.  \nThe server was near the table, saw that the food had arrived, saw the food runner, and went to the table to visually check if everything else arrived, looking for eye contact for anything else.  \nAnother server happened to pass by some time later.\n\nAvoiding a table because one of their requests hasn't been filled yet is a very rookie mistake and indicative of a fundamental lack of understanding that it's okay to approach a table while a request is still being processed in order to perform other tasks unrelated to that request. I don't think you get high-end fine dining.\n\nCould you imagine the chaos if every time a guest had a small request like that it had to go up and get communicated with the server first? What if the server is busy talking to another table? What then? Do you wait and make the guest wait? No. What if you can't find the server? Do you go hunt for them or the manager? No. And if you succeed, what then? Does the server ring it in? The expo call it out? The food runner run it? These support systems exist with the ability to and do things outside of your section and/or responsibilities with the guest's best interest in mind, so that simple requests can be completed in a timely manner.\n\n>Also as far as your drink preferences are concerned.. \u201cmay I get you another\u201d and then reference the tab/server instead of having to go through that bullshit.\n\n\"Having to go through that bullshit\" is exactly what high-end fine dining is. There are so many staff members visiting the table already, it's in the best interest to not interrupt and ask a questions if the guest has already answered them. This is why we go \"through that bullshit\" of keeping track of what each guest is drinking to see if they'd simply like another or if a drink menu should be brought out without the guest having to ask for it. Keeping track of seat numbers to not auction off things. Each guest already told you what they want, no need to ask them again when it arrives.\n\n>If you\u2019re serving ketchup you\u2019re not that fine dining.\n\nWe don't. And if that's how you judge a restaurant then you won't understand. But we don't say no to guests either, so we keep it. We have a lot of things we don't usually serve just in case. Pretty sure there is a Sriracha sauce at all times too. There have been cases where we'll send someone out to go get something from another restaurant or store or whatever just to make it happen.\n\n>Do you serve from the left, clear from the right? Do you do complete clears? Does everyone swarm the table at one time?\n\nOf course, but liquids are served from the right. But, most importantly, we cannot backhand a guest. What matters is which hand you use. You cannot serve a guest from the left with your right hand. It is considered rude. We also serve ladies first and keep track of that which makes it fun for the Expo to call out which plate to put in which hand, so that when the runners arrive at the table they have the correct plate in each hand. 1 person per 2 plates. 1 person per soup with tableside pour. We also call out the seat numbers backwards for big tables so that by the time the first runner makes it to the last seat, everyone behind them has arrived at the same time as well. Each time a clear happens, the entire table is cleared and remarked with appropriate silverware for the next course.",
            "The key thing is to always mention you've already asked someone. If my waiter is on break, etc, and a different one had asked if I need something like a drink refill, when the waiter assigned to me area comes by asking if I need anything, I make sure to state I'm still waiting on a drink I asked the other one for; I *shouldn't* get two that way, and if one *had* forgotten, it's discussed amongst them and resolved.",

There was a machine in a usually-locked room that took concentrated cleaner and diluted it with water. Theoretically anyway. In a year there, I don't think the volume of said chemical went down at all. Which is odd, because we had at least 7 rooms with their own cleaning bottles that were each refilled at least once or twice a week, so even if the chemical was really really diluted you'd probably expect it to have gone down...and one other teacher mentioned once that they thought the director dialed down the amount it would dilute, so.

            "He verbally mentioned a week ago that I should be able to have the cleaning duties completed by 5:30 pm. Now he followed it up via text. \n\nThe mature conversation was had. The reaction was deliberate based on the direct commands of the supervisor.",
            "Because I was hoping that he would be the one to suffer the consequences of his ridiculous decision to prioritize overtime spending over a clean and healthy classroom. He should be the one to walk into the dirty, smelly classroom in the morning - not you!",

            "My son is at an amazing daycare facility here in rural Northern Germany.\n\nEvery day, he just zooms into his group's room, and doesn't even care to say goodbye to us. He sometimes stops to pat his friend on the back, but most often he just goes straight to the breakfast nook, and takes his seat there.\n\nWhen we pick him up, he's coming for us with the same fervour. Straight into our arms, and big cuddles until he's satisfied. Then he waves the workers goodbye.\n\nOn Wednesday, he had a rough day somehow, and just woke up before we picked him up. He was getting a new diaper as we walked in, so we chatted with the workers for a moment. For once he didn't zoom towards us, but towards the boss (who also takes care of the kids on afternoons, it's a daycare with two groups of ~15 kids each). She hugged him, and explained to us how they cuddle each day after he woke up, and apparently even when we were available, he wanted to at least get some of those hugs in. She sounded a bit apologetic even because of his blatant favouritism.\n\nBut for us it was alright. She takes care of him up to 7h/5 days a week. They have a relationship with each other, albeit professional on her side. Yet he's allowed to like her.\n\nWhile we talked, another worker was cleaning the group rooms in the background, while another played in their ball pit with the other child who was still there.\n\nYou can tell they all are pretty relaxed about their job, and it shows in the tenderness they show when handling young kids.\n\nAll I want to say is:\n\nThank you for being there for a kiddo who might see you as one of the constants in their life. Thank you for choosing to take care of them over cleaning duties.\n\nMy son is 18 months old now, and if he wants to cuddle, I prefer someone who gives him a hug over someone who ushers him away.\n\nYour boss is stupid nor valuing that.",
            "The Department of Labor will enjoy hearing about that if so.",

        "content": "This starts as malicious compliance and ends with Petty Revenge. I posted in both. I hope cross-posting is not an issue here!\n\nIt\u2019s a fairly long story but I think I can keep to the essentials. A place I worked at in 2004 had three DBA teams (Data Base Admin). \u00a0\u00a0The team I had been on since I joined was tight and ON-call rotation was pretty easy. If anyone got paged for a database that you were the primary on, then you had to buy the team drinks. \u00a0You rarely got paged. :)\n\nSo End of an era. Do you remember \u201cAl Bundy\u201d doing commercials to save big money on long-distance phone calls?\u00a0 \u00a0That was us!\u00a0 Cell phones and free long-distance put us under.\n\nDuring the death throes, they had massive layoffs and combined 30 DBAs on three teams into one team of 7.\u00a0 I made the cut. \u00a0HOWEVER, they refused to offline any systems so the workload of 30 remained! My old boss did not make the cut and my new boss was a toxic butt-kisser. I don\u2019t even care anymore-- his name was Steve. Worst boss ever! He would defend ANYONE but someone on his team. I believe he legit thought throwing his people under every bus made him a \u201cteam player\u201d Other departments quickly figured out, \u00a0\u201cBlame them and he will blame his people\u201d so they did!\n\nMy first on-call rotation on this new combined team was utter hell! The pager went off every 10 to 15 minutes. Messages like:\n\nJob 104 completed step 5.\n\nJob 110 starting step 12\n\nJob 110 completed step 12.\n\nIn case you did not know-\n\n1. THESE ARE NOT THINGS YOU PAGE OUT FOR!!\n2. \u00a0I have no idea what any of those jobs are, where they are kept or what do about them if they should fail. \u00a0No idea!\n\nOn and on all night long - \u00a0\u00a0You can\u2019t ignore them as you might miss a REAL message about an actual database problem! So you get zero sleep and with the diminished staff they expect you there the next day.\n\nWhen I started ranting the next day the folks left from that particular team said it\u2019s always been that way. That was nuts and we are short staffed so I set out to fix the problem. I looked at every message that got sent to the DBA pager queue and added the prefixes \u201cINFO\" or \"WARN\u201d to every message (kept it short for the pager) Then I changed the pager daemon to route anything starting with \"INFO\" to e-mail and\u00a0ONLY route \u201cWARN\u201d to pagers.\n\nWorked like a champ! We went from 50 pages a night to maybe one per night and often none.\n\nOne day a team meeting was called and Boss Steve was upset that a print job had failed and our on-call person (me) did not respond.\n\n\u201cWhy would I respond to a print job failure? We (database admins) have nothing to with that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you get a page you respond. Period\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would I get a page that a print job failed?\u201d \u00a0\n\n\u201cBecause we always have, didn\u2019t you get the page?\u201d\n\n\u201cOhhhh, that, no I fixed that awhile back. DBA\u2019s only get paged for DBA stuff now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWHAT? You need to put that back the way it was!\u201d\n\nOk, I am cutting a bunch out here for brevity \u2013 I said no! \u00a0The people who were actually responsible should get paged not us-- we ended up in a shouting match! He was yelling he would take me to HR and I told him that worked both ways as he was flat-out abusing us not letting us sleep AND expecting us in at 8:00 AM sharp.\n\nThat slowed him down a little and then he calmly said, \u201cOur department must know everything that happens overnight so we can answer for it in the morning, make sure we get the pages!\n\nOh the evil light bulb went off. I smiled and said, \u201cYes, sir!\u201d Ding! Ding! Ding! \u201cOur department\u201d eh? \u201cWe\u201d eh? Okie Dokey then!\n\nI reworked the pager daemon so that all pages went to HIS pager but left the code that only routed WARN to the on-call pager in place. Now WE and OUR DEPARTMENT know everything that happens overnight! Yes, I am so very proud of that one! I slept soundly that night! \u00a0\n\nThe next morning I kept waiting for him to come over, and either tear into me again OR admit it was a horrible night, that he did not grasp how bad it was but now let\u2019s get a better fix in place.\u00a0 I was disappointed-- \u00a0He said NOTHING to me at all. Did he get all those pages? I double-checked that everything was routed to his pager and it was. He just would not admit he was wrong! I was impressed! I thought he was tough (but stupid) getting all those pages every night and never saying a word!\n\nEND OF MALICIOUS COMPLIANCE\n\nStart petty revenge. :) \u00a0\n\nA few weeks later I was doing an upgrade outage overnight. We were getting to a critical point and needed a decision to roll back or continue and exceed the outage window.\u00a0 I paged him several times. No answer! \u00a0We all sleep through pages from time to time so I rolled back and e-mailed all concerned. No big. \u00a0But he NEVER got back to me. That was odd. The next Monday I mentioned it to the team and several folks said yeah, he does not answer pages after hours anymore!\n\nAAAAAA-HA! \u00a0He was not tough! He just started turning his pager off before bed!  Still too chicken to admit he was wrong. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0A few weeks later I was on call again and late Sunday night I got paged to come in immediately! \u00a0To keep it brief the system that went down was a federally mandated system with severe financial penalties for downtime beyond a limit. We were reaching that limit! It was a huge amount of money! \u00a0All hands on deck! Even the CEO and CIO were there. Developers, sys admin, network, security and DBA with their bosses (with one exception) were all on laptops in the conference room. This was BIG! Thank god it was not a DB problem \u2013 It turned out to be network. The CIO said he appreciated us and wanted all there JUST in case. \u00a0No problem\u2026 sometimes that is the life we choose! :)\u00a0\n\nAt about 5 am Monday after a long night, the CIO says to me,  \u201cHey, I have paged your boss like a dozen times -- he is not answering\u201d\n\nOH GLORIOUS DAY! With a shrug, I very casually say, \u201cOh yeah, yeah, Steve *\\*never\\** answers pages at night.\u201d\n\nHe said nothing out loud but I saw his face cloud up.\n\nAbout 7:30 issues are resolved and we are watching transactions flow across to the feds. I am watching the DB to make sure the huge backlog is not gumming it up but I am just watching as all is well.\n\nAt about 7:45 Ole Steve comes strutting in the door, fresh-faced with a full night's sleep! As he walks past the full conference room he does a double take and stops. When he sees all the heavy hitters (and us plebes) in the room, his face falls, he knew right then he screwed up!\n\nThe CIO Says, loud and mean, \"Where have you been?!\"  Then the CIO and CEO take him out of the room. I have no idea what was said but I bet it was not pretty! lol\n\nThe CIO and CEO come back in about 10 minutes. They heartily thanked us all for the dedication then sent us home and said don\u2019t come back until tomorrow! Good leaders!\n\nI came in the next day and no Steve. I never saw him again! \u00a0\u00a0\n\nI sure am glad I kept that short! :)",

It was little quotes here and there of \u201cYou can\u2019t fit in that anymore\u201c or \u201cYou\u2019ve grown a lot since you wore that\u201d (clothes in question being oversized shirts and shorts, occasionally bathing suits, all from like 9 months prior. For context, I was no longer growing and had stayed the same height and weight for about a year and a half). Eventually, she got bored of making little comments and would say in public while eating out with friends that I shouldn\u2019t eat that, too much fat. Nobody noticed or cared, but I got so pissed that she tried embarrassing me, that my dumb teen self decided to not eat for about 48 hours. She panicked when I stopped eating, because I had a bunch of medical condition (including very low blood sugar) and was starting to ask why I wasn\u2019t eating. I simply responded with \u201cYou called my fat. You wanted me to lose weight. I don\u2019t feel like working out, because the more you tell me this crap, the less I wanna do what you say.\u201d In hindsight, I really should have just kept doing what I was doing instead of being petty, but I was young and easily pissed off. Now I\u2019m just easily pissed off. And before anyone says I shouldn\u2019t disrespect my mother, she also used to hit me for having a different opinion, and isolated me from society for about half a year and hitting me and harassing me verbally when I was 14 for dating somebody who wasn\u2019t born a guy, so yeah. This is less malicious compliance and more \u201cHah, I have trauma\u201c, but I still decided to kinda do what she said.

I seriously only keep a relationship with her because of my grandparents, nobody(the people who knew) had the heart to tell them that their daughter grew up to be an abuser (like my grandfather\u2019s grandfather)",

At least I can still sleep at night ordering from some chain that can shoulder the financial hit, right?\n\nAnd would you look at this - Wingstop is stepping up with a sweet-ass deal on boneless wings.  Free 10pc on my order?  Say considerably less and sign me up. \n\nI rock on up to my cart. \nI throw in a 10pc.\nThe hungerin' rumbles. \nEager to consume, I go to select my sauce...\nAnd the ONLY option is \"Atomic\".  \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI checked their other boneless sizes, and the bone-in 10pc as well, and they all have every flavor listed.  Wingstop straight-up intentionally said \"You want us to dump off entire orders of free wings?  All right.  Sign on the line. But we're ONLY offering them in Satan's Anus flavor\".  \n\nWas I disappointed?  Yes.  But I've got to give them props for complying with this corporate dictum in one of the most technically-correct yet overtly-violent ways imaginable. \nKudos, Wingstop.\nYou will not quell my hunger today, but you have earned my respect and future full-price business.  \ud83d\udc4a",

Many  non-franchise restaurants  have a fucking disclaimer you have to sign to even bite a piece of *really* hot stuff -- like the stunt/TikTok hotness. People have *died* from the hotness. There is no way Wingstop Atomic is as hot as others. (And i've had them they're pretty hot but if you like hot it's nothing.)",

They're typically pretty trash chicken dressed up in sauce in my experience. \n\nWings be messy and if you don't like eating with your hands and getting messy about it it's not gonna be your thing. More for the rest of us lol \n\nDemand better quality and more accurate names from the void industry lol",

Looks like the upvote-to-downvote reception has been pretty split, but breaking even is honestly fine by me.  It got some conversation going and got a few other folks to share fun anecdotes of their own, so win/win.",

You can tell by the texture when you chew. \n\n\n\n If done right, chicken tenders can be amazing - it can be hit or miss though. I only found one place that did tenders great, then they changed the chef who got in nuggets instead. I had better luck at home though",
