They're both very heavy on the same AAPL, TSLA, GOOG etc. Yes, IWDA has thousands of companies but most of them weigh insignificantly in the portfolio.\n\nSo in this case I ask if this diversification is just on paper but not really practical?\n\nFor example, if there's a US tech stock crash aren't you still toast with IWDA? Maybe not toast to the same figure but toast to the same degree?\n\nLater Edit: Is there any form of rebalancing that is done in time? For example if the US stock underperform then an international index fund can redistribute accordingly while a S&P500 is always limited in scope to S&P500. This would make sense to go for diversification. \n\nAny light shed on this is greatly appreciated.",

            "Thanks! That's very helpful. Normally wouldn't recommend an actively managed value fund (which the international one is), but at least Vanguard active funds are relatively cheap and pretty well-manage, and the international growth fund is less good both because of the growth tilt and ER (growth tends to grow less over time than value, ironically enough given the name!). So I'd say your best bet for now is VFIAX, VTRIX, and BAGIX. The ratios are up to your need/ability to take risk (there are some relevant links in the sidebar on that).\n\nPer my other comment, I think something like 40/30/30 would be a good starting point. A lot of people these days would say that's too much in bonds, but I think that's a product of the huge bull market we've had. It's up to you, though -- could also do a more aggressive  45/35/20, just make sure to add more bonds over time either way (rule of thumb: add 5% in bonds per year, up to a total of 40-60% as you approach and get into retirement. Depending on your need for growth, could toy with those numbers, too).\n\nOh, and if/when you leave your job, I'd roll over this 401k to Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab -- you'll have somewhat better and cheaper options there, but there's no rush (your options aren't terrible, and better than a lot of 401ks!).",
            "Vanguard has a solid lineup, but IDK if there's a 'wrong' answer per se -- I'm just less familiar with the other ones out there and mostly the differences are fewer than the similarities. Basically, though, you want to make sure whatever you pick is an indexed version (Fidelity, for example, has both actively managed and indexed ones, and the former are expensive/unnecessary). If you're not sure where to start date-wise, just pick a date around the time you expect to retire. You can tweak that up or down to be less or more aggressive, but that's a good default.\n\nExample: https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/target-retirement-funds",

            "A total-international fund is cheap and easy, unless you're missing that option for some reason (e.g. limited fund options in your 401k). e.g. VXUS (or VT for both US and intl). It's hard to say what's 'good enough' -- developed is better than nothing, but emerging plus developed seems better to me, etc... just like if you don't have access to a total-market fund, a 500 index fund is 'good enough' to not make a huge difference. I tilt toward emerging markets a bit because they tend to be less correlated with developed (US or otherwise), but it's not going to make or break me.",

            "I personally like VOO.  If the money you are investing doesn't need to be touched for anything (emergency, down payment, ...) then I like the strategy.  Bogleheads tend to diversify across 3 major groups.  \n\n1.  Total Market \n2.  International \n3.  Bonds\n\nThey will invest in these according to their risk tolerance.  Explanations and example portfolios are listed in the links at the top of the group for convenience and research.  Recommend going through that to get an idea of where most in this group come from.  \n\nI think looking at the S&P Chart over the long term, your strategy makes sense if you are young and have a lot of time to compound your initial investments in it.  The long term chart demonstrates this very well.  Which is why I like your thought process. \n\nAs you begin to get into your mid career and later, the total Market, international can add a lot of diversity into your portfolio.  Or of course you could start now.  Really no bad choice there.  Rebalancing is a key component to any diverse plan as it allows for taking advantage of market differentials in the different asset classes.  Like taking profits out of your winners and putting them in your less performing assets and getting in on lower prices.  \n\nI've read that by doing this you inherently get roughly a 2-4% boost each year just by rebalancing.  I haven't done a deep dive research on the claim but I can see that it could be a valid observation given the nature of non-correlated asset classes.  \n\nLots of stuff in here, but bottom line is, you are on the right track.  Keep up the hard work and remember the power of compounding works in your favor the sooner you start.  You are well ahead of your peers.  This much, I can assure you.

            "It's worth looking at bonds as an asset class you can rebalance with. When the market is down, the bonds are a source of capital you can use to buy more stocks, and when the market is high you can use that growth to buy more bonds. Rebalancing both reduces your risk and can even lead to a higher long term return depending on the (unknowable) behavior of your preferred asset class. You can also use other non-correlated asset classes like international stocks or a mix of these 3 or more.\n\nYou also run a real risk that the market will be down as you retire, and if it happens to be down significantly, you pay a very large premium as you begin withdrawals. This sequence of returns risk can dramatically reduce your total available assets in retirement, even if you've seen large gains leading up to retirement.",
            "Generally the recommendation is a smooth transition to a higher bond allocation rather than an abrupt cliff at R-5.  Doing it this way means a crash right before R-5 ends up being way worse than a crash just a year later, whereas with a glide path the conservatism scales directly with the impact it will have on your retirement.  \n\nBest case scenario given a crash right before you add bonds is that your R-5 just turns into R-8 or something; you need a couple of extra years of working to get back to your goal retirement number.  A less best case scenario is that the crash is a big one, there's a huge recession, and you lose your job.  Then not only are you losing income and potentially having to work even more years to make that up, but searching for work as a 60+ year old is often an awful experience because even if age discrimination is illegal it's basically impossible to prove and companies generally don't want to hire someone who's going to work a few years.  With a properly conservative asset allocation you can sort of make that work as basically a forced early retirement, but if you lost too much portfolio value it'll be a problem.  \n\nNow I don't think you have to start your glide path 25-30 years before retirement like a lot of TDFs do.  I personally plan to stay aggressive until R-10, transition to my maximum bond allocation by R-5, and then hold there until about R+10 before going back up again.
