            "This is one of the most common mistakes for retail investors. You do not have any knowledge and growth thesis/strategy about the companies you own. If you would have a thesis, you wouldn't ask if you should sell because the stock is up or down, you would ask if your thesis is still intact or not. And this then would be able to answer your question... Take this as a learning experience. \n\nIt's about having a strategy and a plan before you buy. Before you buy is the time where no emotions are involved. Write down your thoughts and your criterias for hold, buy and sell. This makes it easier later when you have shares and emotions evolved, to stay calm and clear. \n\nExample: After your due diligence you decide to buy Lululemon. Your thesis includes the 3 possible growth catalysts: Product innovations, International expansion and accelerated growth in the men catagory. You decide that the valuation is good enough to start the position now. Now you think about your criteria for your later decisions.\n\nHold: Your growth thesis is still intact, the company continues to grow revenue double digits and the growth in international markets is still fast\n\nBuy: You read news about new product innovations that will hit the market later and you think there is a lot of potential. Meanwhile China is growing a lot better than expected.\n\nAnother Buy: The stock is below its 100/200 day moving average due to short term issues in the supply chain. You think this issue will be solved in the second half of the year. Everything else still looks great.\n\nSell: Lululemon's CEO left without notice, the companies new direction is unclear.\n\nAnother Sell: Instead of big revenue growth in Europe and China, the revenue went down and they lost market share to new competitors. You think this could be the beginning of a down cycle and more than just short term issues.\n\nFor now I would recommend you to put all new savings into a cash depot or World/S&P500 ETF, until you feel confident enough to make your own deep dives about the companies you want to own. A good rule is, if you need outside help to decide if you want to buy or not (or sell or not) you should move on to the next stocks. This will help you find out your circle of competence. Start with Youtube videos (interviews) of Mohnish Pabrai and Peter Lynch, this is a good start for newbies.\n\n  \nDo this before you sell or buy new stocks. Not advice but my opinion is Dell could be a great long term hold, very safe Business I don't see any reason to rush a decision on this one. BABA does depends a lot of chinese politics, if you think this will be fine the next 5-10 years, it could go up again. Palantir is an AI play for the long term, very difficult to understand industry and very volatile. There is a high chance this thing swings up again, which could give you a better selling point, if you decide to do so. No Idea about Veriv.",

            "Oh absolutely but the tricky part is figuring out your hit rate, figuring out how much liquidity the trade can carry, identifying where it's going to go wrong. Most of the shorter term alpha trades have an expiration date. Like the inefficiencies are there until enough people notice them. For example some of the classic examples of how money was made easily during the Jesse Livermore day or even in the '90s, some of those methods that no longer work, the turtles. They worked for awhile \n\nFast forward to today. Here's what's so supremely difficult about becoming a good trader. You can look on social media or YouTube or anywhere and get great advice on video games. You can figure out how to get the best stuff. How to do really well. You can learn all of it. You want to learn about chainsaws you want to learn about cars you want to learn about homes. You can get great information \n\nWhen it comes to trading, there's none. Zero. There are occasionally channels or shows or people who make comments that can be relevant but they are slivers of information in the grand scheme. It's up to you to figure out a strategy that actually works. I guess the best way to say it is it's like going into a video game with no instruction book, no YouTube, no one to help you out. Talk about being an 8-year-old in the '80s. All these data points. You can look at them, if you're good you can even write programs to analyze them and come up with hit rates. People are looking at thousands of data points every day trying to figure out if there's an edge in some of them. I've done it. I found a few different methods that have worked for various lengths of time but they all expire or they shift. I'm not doing the same thing today that I was in 2017. \n\nIt's going to take years for people to really figure out how to make AI the most effective, maybe it won't take that long I mean I guess I can't say but right now even if you put in all of the data points. They have to be done in a way that is useful. Hit rates, percentages, probabilities. It's a constantly evolving art and it's one that the smartest people win at. One of the best public examples is probably the medallion fund. They did it, it works and they even did it on a fairly large scale. If you're talking small accounts like less than a half a million. There are a couple edges that I'm aware of that still work pretty well. There are probably more that I don't know about and that's the fun of this",

            "The headline is misleading, they signed a memorandum of understanding. \n\nThat\u2019s like signing a agreement that I will buy a Tesla next year if they figure out autonomous driving until then.",
            "Hopefully this will be enough to make the stock move in a positive way. My calls are finally coming back up",
            "Do they have regulatory approval for this?",
            "What even is the difference between what they make and helicopters?",
            "AUR is next - get in now",
            "It\u2019s going to be a loooong time until these companies start making any kind of real money.",
            "I wouldn't worry about it.",
            "Don't worry it can still not actually happen. This company planning this service doesn't mean they succeed at implementing the service, or succeed financially.\n\nThe other thing is, OK, let's assume they succeed at implementing their flying taxi service. They claim they'll be able to do SF to San Jose in 10 minutes. That's cool. The problem is they're only going to have one heliport per city to start. If you need to uber for 15 minutes to the port, then wait for the helicopter for 20 minutes, then fly for 12 minutes, then uber for 12 minutes again, it becomes a lot less attractive than actually flying point to point. You definitely won't save any money, and you might not even save any time, so it's not clear that this service will become profitable. It definitely has novelty value, but robotaxis are coming, and they'll take you from SF to San Jose point to point... Also Uber is already here and it already does that, if you can tolerate having a human driver.",
            "And customers willing to risk their lives in them?",
            "They just received regulatory approval to operate a business.\n\nThe planes are not certified yet.",
            "Doubt they stay in business long enough to find out. The market for people who can afford to travel on these routes and take another car at their destination can\u2019t be that big.",
            "Indeed, there's so many problems with air taxi businesses. Just off the top of my head from what I've read about this sector.\n\n* FAA regulations limit how many hours their pilots can fly in a month, which makes it way more costly to recruit enough pilots to meet the demand.\n\n* You can't just land an air taxi wherever you want. Which means that if you want to ride in one you first have to drive to the the air taxi location. And then the air taxi can't bring you directly to your destination, so unless the nearing landing spot just so happens to be within easy walking distance you'll probably have to get a land taxi or something to travel the last few miles or so to your destination.\n\n* And because of the above, air taxi's often end up taking MORE time then just driving to your destination in the first place, all while being more expensive to.\n\n* And this isn't even getting into the costs of the air taxis themselves, the margins of the business, etc.",
            "That\u2019s a good point, we often worry about missing the boat but that\u2019s usually not the case. Someone who invested in Netflix in 2012, five years into their streaming era, would be up about 50x today. That\u2019s not quite as good as the 100x since the trough of the Financial Crisis, but still pretty darn good.\u00a0",
            "That too, but here in the Bay Area I\u2019d say there probably are. Getting something built and functioning here would take a while"
