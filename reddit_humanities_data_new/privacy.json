        "content": "My post relates very much to [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1cn6ps5/should_i_use_googles_find_my_device/) which is a month old. Like their Samsung device, this feature is now coming to my Redmi device also. Today only I received the email with subject, *\"Your Android devices will soon join the Find My Device network\"*.\n\nAs always, the **real** privacy nightmare stuff is always hidden in between the large boring paragraphs or the fine print as they say. Here is the part which I think is the most problematic: \n\n> How it works\n> \n> Devices in the network use Bluetooth to scan for nearby items. If other devices detect your items, they\u2019ll securely send the locations where the items were detected to Find My Device. *Your Android devices will do the same to help others find their offline items when detected nearby.*\n\nSo, your devices are also supposed to co-operate by sending data to other devices which may want their location detected while offline. We are made to believe here that this data pertains to only our location and nothing else but once this thing becomes too ubiquitous, one can easily see the scope for surveillance capitalism by the powers that be?\n\nThis is very much like the Microsoft's recall scenario, I don't see much difference between this and that. At least there the data is still on the user's device and doesn't leave its shores, this is arguably even worse. For such technology to be palatable to the power user, they must at the very least, be prepared to open source this code. I think recall would have still got some acceptance had Microsoft made the code open source. This whole \"you trust me bro but I won't trust you\" business is highly cynical and doesn't usually have a long shelf life.",

            "\n\nThere are two viewpoints:\n\nEither you trust Google enough that they don't use that data for tracking but just want to compete with Apple.\n\nOr you don't trust them, then you should at least opt-out but tbh should have switched to something like the popular alternative OS that exidts for Pixel Phones long ago.\n\nOh, and no, in no way near as bad as Microsoft Recall. Not even close.",
            "I just want to add a bit of nuance here. To start with, yes, Google is processing your location. If Find My Device is available to you, then you have a device with Google Location Services turned on. If you have that, then your device is already constantly talking to Google about everything it sees to provide you with a more accurate position. Find My Device does not change anything about that.\n\nNow the way this system works has actually been designed with privacy in mind. I'm talking from the finding perspective here. Obviously the trackers themselves are a privacy nightmare. But Google did put in effort to ensure that it's hard to track passive participants in the network.\n\nThat's because it will only show the location of a tag once it's been reported by a sufficient amount of different devices. It then shows an average of all those pings. That means you can find the location of the tag, but it's going to be very difficult to find out who was near it, where they were exactly or when. This does strike a balance between privacy and usefulness.\n\nNow you may not trust Google at all, in which case you should probably at the very least turn Google Location Services off. That is entirely fair. They've not exactly shown themselves to be particularly trustworthy. But if you do think that the trade-off is a fair one and you trust that it's implemented the way they say it is, then I would argue that this is a pretty solid design. And while it can be abused, it can also be very useful.",

We ask to have our privacy respected, instead we get (Sigh)*another* tracking vector because we *may* lose our effing phone? \n\nAll devices *interconnected*...to find *one*. 7 years ago, that would be cute.

That shit is gonna cost Microsoft hundreds of millions, maybe a billion dollars in lost revenue directly and from future adoption and brand trust and image. They are doing good as far as PR and keeping shareholder dicks from going flaccid, but it's still a billion dollar fiasco. \n\nThis on the other hand is logical from a business and consumer perspective and got to come into the same market segment as Apple, well behind AirTags and the \"warming up\" period the public always needs when something scary in the news spooks them. Besides that, Google has been doing this for 15 years already. So has Microsoft, but they didn't have the use case for it like Google did, being an actual mobile device manufacturer with those devices in the pockets of 4 billion people. Beacon metadata for location service is really old though. Google just crowd-sourced it and got to watch a beta run from Apple first.",
            "This is peak ignorance. I am generally encouraged by many of the replies, sometimes it's hit or miss in this sub. Google spearheads _actual_ privacy-first technology, and a supposed privacy advocate wants them to burn it to the ground for being anti-privacy in some deeply nonsensical conspiracy. Let's just be super clear here: you are hurting the movement.\n\nThis technology is year and I hope they pursue it in more places by more companies. Maybe Google can use client owned encryption scheme in their core ads business so they and the advertiser know even less about you, but still allow them to do what they need to do. That words be a much better world than what we have now. There are many possibly good directions from this technology being used more broadly.\n\nWhat I often see in popular posts is conflating privacy with some anti-corporate culture agenda. If you want to hate on big companies for X Y Z, I'll be right there with you. But, for example:\n\n> I don't see much difference between this and that.\n\nThat's because you probably don't understand this or that. I hope this deeply concerns you so that you can develop a better understanding and continue to advocate for privacy supporting culture. Privacy is under attack in so many areas of our lives. It's refreshing to see an actual win.\n\nCheers",

            "This protocol, like Apple\u2019s, is highly privacy preserving. As a finding device (the one that hears Bluetooth messages from the lost device and reports their location) no identifying information is given about you to Google or the owner of the lost device. Your location is encrypted and Google cannot see it, only the person who owns the lost device gets the location, but like I said before it has no identifying information that could associate it to you.",

Turning off location, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi is insufficient when your device is constantly phoning home. Even without a Google account, if you aren't blocking traffic back to Google, you're still being tracked.\n\nI would suggest the FOSS FindMyDevice on F-Droid (Droidify FTW) and use that instead of you really need something like Google's official solution. As long as your phone is on, you can have trusted contacts text codes to your phone to perform tasks or report information to help you find it.",
            "Honestly I don't see this as a big deal compared to everything else Android has enabled by default already. Most people have location history, \"precise location\" and GPS photo tagging enabled without knowing it.\n\nGoogle already has a complete worldmap of devices already anyway, every Android phone pings the mothership all the time already, and a lot of it stays even if you disable it.\n\nIf anything, with this service at least users get to have an advantage of it as well, which really is the only thing changing. Google has had all this information for ages and now people get to actually see how detailed and comprehensive it is; maybe that's why it took G so long to implement it.\n\nSo if you're against this feature, then you should be against the underlying location service in the first place.\n\nRecall is different, because Microsoft are incompetent morons which are just creating another way for hackers to track you instead of them. Say what you want about Google, but at least they're providing their services and Android free of charge, and users have at least a theoretical direct advantage from their stuff.\n\nWindows exists only for the sake of running other programs and services, it's a *paid* system which still  bothers users with ads, a bonkers amount of telemetry that consumes an insane amount of resources, and keeps bugging you about their shit stuff like Edge and Bing. Recall may be local (but we'll see about that), but it's also totally unsecure *and* on a system that's already the most targeted by hackers directly.\n\nNo... Both companies are just as shit and monopolistic and shouldn't be trusted, but MS is *also* annoying and incompetent.",

            "There are lots of situations where you do just have to trust that they are handling data on the servers the way they say they are or something, but in this particular case it is very easy to verify how it works because you can (and people have) take two phones, instrument them and check that the protocol is working how they say it does.\n\nTo guarantee that Google is not seeing your location all you have to know is that 1) the keys are being generated on your device and 2) the finding device is using the public key to encrypt the location.  You can even make your own implementation that generates its own keys if you want and then retrieve locations for it, and since that does work then you know there can't be anything up Google's sleeve.  It's as transparent as it could possibly be.",
            "What does a PIN have to do with anything? The key pairs are generated on the device and Google never sees them."
