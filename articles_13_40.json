The book is set to hit the shelves in October. It will be a posthumous publication.\n\nIn September 2023, Simon Boas was diagnosed with throat cancer. Aged just 46, he was told the disease was terminal, and that it would ultimately take his life.\n\nMy pain is under control and I'm terribly happy - it sounds weird to say, but I'm as happy as I've ever been in my life.\n\nI used to think I'd rather be hit by the proverbial bus, but having a couple of months knowing this is coming has really helped me both do the boring 'death-min', but also get my thoughts and prepare myself, and feel so accepting of what's to come.\n\nIt's been such a great bonus, actually.\n\nThe book is called A Beginner's Guide to Dying, but really what I'm trying to convey is how enjoying life to the full kind of prepares you for this.\n\nIn some ways I was lucky that my life and my career have taken me to quite a lot of places where death is more a part of life than it is for us in the West.\n\nI spent my life as an aid worker - quite a lot with the UN - and I've lived in places where death is something that not just exists in the background, but is imminently possible.\n\nI spent three years running a UN office in the Gaza Strip. I spent a lot of time in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and I've been working in Ukraine. Seeing people there for whom death is such a part of life - they lose children, they don't know where the next meal is coming from - has really helped me.\n\nI've also been a Samaritan for the past four years. In some cases you are on the line while people end their lives, so I think death has been more a part of my life than for many people.\n\nIt does us all good to think about it.\n\nThat's not in a gloomy way... by kind of realising it's inevitable and it's a part of life, it actually throws life into perspective and helps you to enjoy it more and prioritise the important things.\n\nMy family are about to go through the most difficult thing in their lives. My lovely wife, Aurelie, and my parents... are well surrounded, and I hope that my cheerfulness in the leaving of life might perhaps help them in the next few years...\n\nAll our lives are little books - but they're not someone else's complete book. You're a chapter or a page or a footnote in someone else's life and they are going to keep writing beautiful chapters when you are gone.\n\nAnd those green shoots can grow around grief and put it in perspective. I hope people will think, \"I'm glad I read that - Simon's story\". And just because it's over, doesn't mean it's gone.\n\nYou don't need to have been a politician or a mover and shaker or an aid worker or anything in life. All of us make a huge difference.\n\nI love this quote from George Eliot's Middlemarch:\n\n\"The effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistorical acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.”\n\nAll of us make a huge difference in life. I love the idea that most films about time travel revolve around changing one tiny thing in the past, and of course they come back to the present and everything is different.\n\nIf you project that forward, you can change huge amounts of things into the future.\n\nAll our tombs will be unvisited in a few years - all our actions will mostly be unremembered - but the smile you gave the checkout lady or the kind words you gave to a stranger in the street could still be rippling forward.\n\nWe all have that opportunity and it's a huge power. And I want everyone to realise how special and precious they are.\n\nI love melted cheese. Unfortunately I haven't been able to eat since Christmas. The chemotherapy killed my taste buds and the radiotherapy killed my salivary glands.\n\nSo, sadly, melted cheese and all the things I loved are off the menu.\n\nHowever, I've been given full permission by my oncologist and my hospice team to enjoy as much Muscadet and as many cheeky rollups as I want - and I shall certainly be indulging in those and spending time with my family.\n\nI'm sort of - not looking forward to my final day - of course that's the wrong way to see it. But I'm kind of curious about it, and I'm happy and I'm ready.\n\nAs Julian of Norwich said: \"All shall be well, and all shall be well and all manner of things shall be well.\"",
    "Weight-loss drug linked to rare eye condition": "Study links weight-loss drug to rare eye condition\n\n3 days ago Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nPeople prescribed semaglutide, sold as Ozempic and Wegovy, to lose weight, may have a higher risk of developing a serious but rare eye condition, a study suggests. Analysing 17,000 patients over six years, US researchers found those taking the drug for type 2 diabetes were four times more likely to be diagnosed with the condition than patients not on the drug. Among those taking it for obesity, the risk of the condition was seven times higher. But the researchers cannot prove semaglutide caused the eye condition, which can lead to loss of vision in one eye, nor can they explain the increased risk or the difference between the groups. The numbers affected were small.\n\n'Beach-body ready'\n\nNovo Nordisk, the company that makes the drug, said patient safety was “a top priority” but the study had lots of limitations. Trials show semaglutide can help people with obesity lose more than 10% of their body weight, if they also make changes to diet and lifestyle. There has been huge hype around the drug after celebrities on social media starting posting about their sudden weight loss while taking it. Despite it being available on prescription only to people with type 2 diabetes (Ozempic) and the most obese (Wegovy), online pharmacies are selling semaglutide injections with few checks on the weight or underlying health of the person buying them. And as a result, health bosses say they are worried the drug is being misused as \"a quick fix\" for people trying to get \"beach-body ready\". All medicines carry potential side-effects. Some of the most common for semaglutide include: nausea\n\nvomiting\n\ndiarrhoea\n\nstomach pain\n\nconstipation A change in vision is listed as one of the more serious potential side-effects, on both Ozempic and Wegovy's safety information for patients.\n\nNon-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), affects up to 10 out of 100,000 people in the general population, the researchers, from Harvard Medical School, report in journal JAMA Ophthalmology. It is thought to be caused by reduced blood flow to an optic nerve and cannot currently be treated. The study revealed: 17 cases among type 2 diabetes patients taking semaglutide\n\nsix cases among type 2 diabetes patient taking other drugs\n\n20 cases among overweight and obese patients taking semaglutide\n\nthree cases among overweight and obese patients taking a different drug Harvard Medical School ophthalmology professor Dr Joseph Rizzo said: \"Our findings should be viewed as being significant but tentative, as future studies are needed to examine these questions in a much larger and more diverse population.\" UK eye experts from the Royal College of Ophthalmologists recommend patients taking semaglutide are informed of the small risk of developing eye diseases.\n\nBalance of side-effects and benefits\n\nBecause of the small numbers of patients affected by the eye condition in the study - who may not have been taking their medication as prescribed or be representative of the wider population - the statistics on risk may not be accurate.\n\nNovo Nordisk said the study did not take into account whether patients smoked or for how long they had had diabetes. And there were challenges in accurately coding and identifying cases of the eye condition. A spokesperson said: \"NAION is not listed as a known adverse drug reaction\" for marketed formulations of semaglutude - Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy. \"Semaglutide has been studied in large real-world evidence studies and robust clinical development programmes.\" The drug is also being examined in a trial called Focus, which concludes in 2027, to assess its long-term effects on diabetic retinopathy - an eye condition in type 2 diabetes patients.",
    "Queensland orders sperm donation purge over mix-ups": "Australian state orders sperm bank purge over mix-ups\n\nQueensland's fertility industry has come under scrutiny in recent years\n\nA purge of frozen sperm has been ordered in the Australian state of Queensland, after an audit by its health watchdog found almost half of fertility samples were at risk of misidentification.\n\nSuch mix-ups can rob parents and donor children of key genetic information and medical records, and advocates say creates a danger of accidental incest.\n\nQueensland is home to one of the country’s largest IVF industries, however it is self-regulated and has come under scrutiny as some of its biggest providers face claims of malpractice.\n\nThe clean out compounds a national shortage of donated sperm which has been driven by high demand, tightening regulations, and pandemic-related disruptions.\n\nOne in six Australian couples face difficulty trying to start a family, government data shows, with many increasingly relying on donors to conceive.\n\nAn inquiry into the multi-million-dollar sector in Queensland by the state’s health ombudsman this week found “systemic issues” concerning “quality and safety” and “safeguards for consumers, donors and donor-conceived children”.\n\nThe report detailed how 42% of sperm donations, egg samples and embryos in Queensland had “ identification and traceability” issues - meaning clinics had lost track of or incorrectly labelled samples, or allowed them to deteriorate below laboratory standards.\n\nIt also aired allegations from patients who accused IVF providers of failing to disclose the medical conditions of donors, misidentifying eggs and embryos, and mixing up sperm - which one family said had resulted in them parenting children from different biological fathers.\n\nThe body recommended that all fertility providers destroy stored donor material that does not meet current identification standards.\n\n“The impact on consumers and the donor-conceived children... cannot be underestimated,” the report concluded, adding that “appropriate counselling should be offered” by fertility providers.\n\nIt is unclear how many sperm samples could be destroyed, but the ombudsman deemed \"thousands\" frozen before 2020 as \"high risk” because they “did not comply with double witnessing” - a practice in which two IVF professionals check a patient’s material has been labelled correctly.\n\nAnastasia Gunn - a mother suing one of Queensland’s fertility providers for allegedly providing her with the wrong sperm in 2014 - told the Guardian Australia she was “horrified [but] not surprised” by the ombudsman’s findings.\n\n“It is scary to think how many patients may have unknowingly conceived with the wrong sperm.\n\n“Why were the clinics not double-checking when they were making humans? The effects of these errors last for generations,” she added.",
    "'Hysterical': The women calling out doctors’ gaslighting": "Doctors dismissed these women as hysterical. Now they're fighting back\n\n4 days ago By Hannah Ritchie , BBC News, Sydney Share\n\nHeidi Metcalf A recent government survey found that two thirds of women, like Heidi Metcalf, have encountered gender bias or discrimination in Australian healthcare\n\nThere’s a memory, or more specifically a moment, that came to define Heidi Metcalf’s second birth. It wasn’t saying goodbye to her husband and newborn before being wheeled into an operating theatre, or the heart attack she thought she was having as she lay there on the table. It was when a male obstetrician “ripped the placenta” out of her body, without word or warning. A nurse, Ms Metcalf knows the intervention - while immensely painful - was necessary. She couldn't push it out naturally, which was causing potentially fatal bleeding. But she hadn’t “seen or met this man before”, and she can’t get past the fact that her consent, during one of the most traumatic experiences of her life, “meant so little”. “It felt like a violation - I needed to feel involved in what was happening to my body, and not just like a bystander.” Ms Metcalf is one of thousands of Australian women who have come forward to tell their stories, after the federal government assembled a team of experts to tackle what it calls “medical misogyny”. So far, they have uncovered that a staggering two-thirds of females nationwide have encountered gender bias or discrimination in healthcare. And many say it is taking place when they're at their most vulnerable, such as during intimate examinations, or like Ms Metcalf, while in labour. Others report having their pain dismissed or dangerously misdiagnosed. The BBC spoke to six women for this piece. They shared experiences of being called “anxious”, “pushy” or even “hysterical” while seeking treatment for a range of debilitating symptoms. They also said they felt that the men in their lives seemed to consistently have their pain taken more seriously.\n\n'I just don't feel safe'\n\nNadiah Akbar was once told by a doctor in Singapore that the extreme fatigue she was experiencing was due to the “stress” of being a busy mother. Tests would later show it was thyroid cancer.\n\nNadiah Akbar Nadiah Akbar says she has been misdiagnosed repeatedly - often having her symptoms dismissed as stress releated\n\nYears later, in remission and having migrated to Australia, staff at a Melbourne hospital failed to diagnose a cartilage tear in her hip socket and a slipped disk in her back. Instead, they suggested the crippling pain could be linked to “depression” or being “overtired”. It led to Ms Akbar paying for two costly MRI scans out of pocket to be taken seriously. “‘Oh, it’s nothing.’ I’ve heard that statement so many times... It’s really disheartening as a human being to keep hearing that,” she says. “It takes a lot of energy for you to keep advocating for yourself, and that’s the part that’s worrying - a lot of people just stop.” Laura - who asked to have her name changed - is close to that point, after years of having symtoms of what would eventually be confirmed as a traumatic brain injury dismissed. “I don’t get healthcare without my partner with me, that’s a blanket rule,” she says, explaining that she feels her concerns are taken “more seriously” when voiced by a man. “I just don't feel safe, engaging with the system, because when you're young and you're told over and over that something is all in your head, it's easy to believe it.” Like so many others across the country, both women say they’re coming forward to share their experiences to seize on this moment of promised change. Assistant health minister Ged Kearney - who chairs the national council tasked with examining these issues - says that their stories, along with those of countless others facing additional disadvantage in First Nations, LGBTQ+, and migrant communities will guide its work. Her team's remit is vast and broad areas of focus have already emerged. But untangling gender inequity in medicine is no small task, and Australia’s attempts could have far-reaching implications as other nations eye reforms.\n\nGed Kearney Assistant health minister Ged Kearney with her daughter and granddaughter\n\n'A one-size-fits-all approach'\n\nThe problem is not that “all healthcare professionals have some set agenda against women”, Ms Kearny says. Rather it's that bias is woven into the fabric of modern medicine because for centuries it was “delivered by and designed for” men. Women’s health - by contrast – was often rooted in myth and pernicious gender stereotypes. “Hysteria”, a now-defunct medical term, was a catch-all diagnosis for females presenting with an array of symptoms, meaning their pain was attributed to emotional causes, rather than biological ones. But today, some women say they continue to feel gaslit - disbelieved and patronised - in medical settings. And a lack of diversity in medical research compounds the issue. More than 70% of participants in early-stage clinical trials globally are still white men, while male cells and animals are used as standard in the lab, according to Professor Robyn Norton, a public health expert. The results are then applied to women, intersex, trans and gender-diverse people, causing issues when it comes to their treatment, diagnosis and how their symptoms are understood, Prof Norton says. She describes it as a “one-size-fits-all, male-centric” approach to healthcare that has created huge knowledge gaps. One analysis carried out in 2019 by the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research - which used data from the entire Danish population - found that, across 770 diseases they studied, women were diagnosed later than men, with an average lag time of four years. In Australia, research from the University of Sydney in 2018 found that females admitted to hospital for serious heart attack were half as likely as men to get proper treatment and that they died at twice the rate six months after discharge. Scientists have warned that another roadblock is the chronic underinvestment in women-specific health issues. Endometriosis is pointed to as a key example. Despite impacting roughly 10% of reproductive-age women and girls globally, there is no cure, and it takes seven years on average for patients to be diagnosed. One recent study found that 89% of Australian women were still being advised by health professionals that pregnancy would fix their symptoms - despite growing evidence it's a medical fallacy. Such disparities are being recognised and investigated globally, experts say - with countries comparing notes on what might be the best approach. The UK, for one, recently announced measures aimed at closing the “gender health gap” in its system. And in the US, the federal government has launched an initiative to improve funding and research into women’s health, led by First Lady Jill Biden.\n\nBonney Corbin/Australian Women's Health Alliance Bonney Corbin has spent her career trying to make Australian healthcare more equitable",
    "US pays Moderna $176m to develop bird-flu vaccine": "US pays Moderna $176m to develop bird-flu jab\n\n4 days ago By Michelle Roberts , Digital health editor, BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe US government has given Moderna $176m (£139m) to develop a messenger-ribonucleic-acid-based (mRNA) pandemic influenza vaccine that would work against bird flu. It says it wants to be \"better prepared\" for public-health crises, having learned lessons from Covid. Bird flu is not a big threat to people, despite outbreaks in poultry and cattle. But experts want a working vaccine that could be quickly rolled out, in case the virus mutates and becomes a problem.\n\nVaccines using mRNA technology - which the Moderna's Covid jab is also based on - can be produced more quickly. And the US government says adding this technology to its pandemic-flu toolkit enhances its ability to be \"nimble and quick\" against bird flu. The $176m, from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, will be used to complete late-stage development and testing of Moderna's vaccine against H5N1 avian influenza.\n\nPotentially fatal",
    "Duo euthanasia: Why a happily married couple decided to die together": "Dying together: Why a happily married couple decided to stop living\n\n7 days ago By Linda Pressly , BBC News Share\n\nBBC Jan (70) and Els (71) photographed two days before they died\n\nJan and Els were married for almost five decades. In early June, they died together after being given lethal medication by two doctors. In the Netherlands, this is known as duo-euthanasia. It’s legal, and it’s rare - but every year, more Dutch couples choose to end their lives this way.\n\nSome people might find this article upsetting.\n\nThree days before they voluntarily take their last breath, Jan and Els’ campervan sits on a sunlit marina in Friesland, in the Netherlands’ north. They’re a couple who love being mobile, and have lived most of their marriage in a motorhome, or on boats. “We tried sometimes [to live] in a pile of stones - a house,” jokes Jan, when I visit them, “but it doesn’t work.” He’s 70, and sits in the swivel driving-seat of the van, one leg bent underneath him in the only position that eases his continuous back pain. His wife, Els, is 71 and has dementia. Now, she struggles to formulate her sentences. “This is very good,” she says, standing up easily and pointing to her body. “But this is terrible,” she says, pointing to her head. Jan and Els met in kindergarten - theirs was a lifelong partnership. When he was young, Jan played hockey for the Netherlands’ national youth team, and then became a sports coach. Els trained as a primary school teacher. But it was their shared love of water, boats, and sailing that defined their years together. As a young couple they lived on a houseboat. They later bought a cargo boat and built a business transporting goods around the Netherlands’ inland waterways. Meanwhile, Els gave birth to their only son (who asked not to be named). He became a weekly boarder at school and spent weekends with his parents. During school holidays when their child was onboard too, Jan and Els looked for work trips that would take them to interesting places – along the river Rhine, or to the Netherlands’ islands. By 1999, the inland cargo business had become very competitive. Jan was experiencing serious back pain from the heavy-duty work he had been doing for more than a decade. He and Els moved on land, but after a few years they were again living on a boat. When that became too much to manage, they bought their spacious campervan. Jan had surgery on his back in 2003, but it didn’t improve. He had halted a heavy regime of pain killers and could no longer work, but Els was still busy teaching. Sometimes they talked about euthanasia - Jan explained to his family he didn’t want to live too long with his physical limitations. It was around this time the couple joined NVVE – the Netherlands’ “right to die” organisation. “If you take a lot of medicine, you live like a zombie,” Jan told me. “So, with the pain I have, and Els’ illness, I think we have to stop this.” When Jan says “stop this”, he means - stop living.\n\nJan pictured with his son in 1982\n\nIn 2018, Els retired from teaching. She was showing early signs of dementia but resisted seeing a doctor – perhaps because she had witnessed the decline and death of her father with Alzheimer’s. But there came a point when her symptoms couldn’t be ignored. In November 2022, after being diagnosed with dementia, Els stormed out of the doctor’s consulting room, leaving her husband and son behind. “She was furious – like a steaming bull,” remembers Jan. It was after Els learned her condition wouldn’t improve that she and Jan, with their son, began to discuss duo-euthanasia – the two of them dying together. In the Netherlands, euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal if someone makes a voluntary request, and their suffering – physical or psychological – is assessed by doctors as “unbearable”, with no prospect of improvement. Every person who requests assisted dying is assessed by two doctors – the second checking the evaluation made by the first.\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIn 2023, 9,068 people died by euthanasia in the Netherlands – around 5% of the total number of deaths. There were 33 instances of duo-euthanasia, so 66 people. These are complex cases made even more so if one of the partners has dementia, where there can be uncertainty about their capacity to give consent. “A lot of doctors don’t even want to think about performing euthanasia on a patient with dementia,” says Dr Rosemarijn van Bruchem, a geriatrician and ethicist at the Erasmus Medical Centre, in Rotterdam. This was the position of Jan and Els’ GP. And that reluctance among doctors is reflected in the euthanasia figures. Of the thousands who died in 2023, 336 had dementia. So how do medics assess the legal requirement for “unbearable suffering” in patients with dementia? For many with early stage dementia, it's uncertainty about how things might progress that can lead them to think about ending their life, explains Dr van Bruchem. “Am I going to not be able to do the things I find important? Am I going to not recognise my family anymore? If you can express that well enough, if it is perceivable for both the doctor that is willing to perform euthanasia, as well as the [second] doctor that is specialised in mental competency, the existential fear of what is to come can be the reason to consider euthanasia.”\n\nEls, photographed in 1968, was diagnosed with dementia later in life\n\nWith their GP unwilling to engage, Jan and Els approached a mobile euthanasia clinic - the Centre of Expertise on Euthanasia. It supervised around 15% of assisted deaths last year in the Netherlands, and, on average, grants about a third of the requests it receives. In the case of a couple wishing to end their lives together, medics must be certain one partner isn’t influencing the other. Dr Bert Keizer has attended two duo euthanasia cases. But he also recalls meeting another couple, when he suspected the man was coercing his wife. On a further visit, Dr Keizer talked to the woman alone. “She said she had so many plans…!” Dr Keizer says, explaining that the woman clearly realised her husband was gravely ill, but had no plans to die with him. The euthanasia process was halted and the man died from natural causes. His wife is still alive.\n\nDr Theo Boer, professor of healthcare ethics at the Protestant Theological University, is one of the Netherlands’ few outspoken critics of euthanasia, and believes progress in palliative care often mitigates the need for its use. “I would say that killing by a doctor could be justified. However, that needs to be an exception.” What worries Dr Boer is the impact of duo-euthanasia cases – especially after one of the Netherlands’ former prime ministers and his wife chose to die together earlier this year, and made global headlines. “In the past year we’ve seen dozens of cases of duo-euthanasia, and there’s a general tendency to ‘hero-ify’ dying together,” says Dr Boer. “But the taboo on intentional killing - that’s eroding, and especially when it comes to duo-euthanasia.\"\n\nJan and Els could probably go on living indefinitely in their campervan. Do they feel they might be dying too soon? “No, no, no – I cannot see it,” says Els. \"I’ve lived my life, I don’t want pain anymore,” says her husband. “The life we’ve lived, we’re getting old [for it]. We think it has to be stopped.” And there’s something else. Els has been assessed by doctors who say she still has the capacity to decide for herself that she wants to die - but this could change if her dementia becomes more advanced. None of this has been easy for Jan and Els’ son. “You don’t want to let your parents die,\" explains Jan. \"So there have been tears - our son said, ‘Better times will come, better weather’ - but not for me.” Els feels the same. “There is no other solution.”\n\nEls and Jan on their wedding day, 1975\n\nThe day before their appointment with the euthanasia doctors, Els, Jan, their son and grandchildren were together. Ever practical, Jan wanted to explain the idiosyncrasies of the campervan, so it would be ready to sell. “Then I went for a walk on the beach with my mum,” their son says. “The kids were playing, there were some jokes… It was a very strange day. “I remember we were having dinner in the evening, and I got tears in my eyes just watching us all having that final dinner together.” On Monday morning, everyone gathered at the local hospice. The couple’s best friends were there, brothers of both Jan and Els, and their daughter-in-law with their son. “We had two hours together, before the doctors came,” he says. “We spoke about our memories… And we listened to music.” Idlewild by Travis for Els, the Beatles’ Now and Then for Jan. “The final half hour was difficult,” their son says. “The doctors arrived and everything happened quickly - they follow their routine, and then it’s just a matter of minutes.” Els van Leeningen and Jan Faber were administered lethal medication by doctors and died together on Mon 3 June 2024. Their campervan still hasn’t been put up for sale. Els and Jan’s son has decided to keep it for a bit, and go on holiday with his wife and children. “I’ll sell it in the end,” he says. “First I want to make some memories for the family.”",

Twelve of them died.\n\n“Most of the people who we saw coming into the hospital were in their 60s or 70s, although there were some around 45 and even a couple in their 20s,” Dr Sheikh told the BBC.\n\nSymptoms including vomiting, diarrhoea and a high fever.\n\n“Many of those we saw had been working outside. We’ve told them to make sure they drink plenty of water and wear light clothes in these high temperatures.”\n\nThe high temperatures - described as a “partial heatwave” by one meteorologist – began at the weekend.\n\nHeatwave centres and camps were set up to try to provide relief to the public.\n\nPictures show children playing in fountains as they tried to cool off.\n\n“Look at me!

    "Haemophilia B: My £2.6m blood has 'cured' my haemophilia": "I have £2.6m blood and it has 'cured' my haemophilia\n\n27 June 2024 By James Gallagher , @JamesTGallagher, Health and science correspondent Share\n\nBBC Elliott Collins spent 29 years needing regular injections to help clot his blood, now he feels cured\n\nA transformational gene therapy that treats the bleeding disorder haemophilia B is being made available on the NHS. Elliott Collins was one of the first to get the treatment when he took part in the trials that proved it worked. He says he \"feels cured\" and the gene therapy has given him a \"new lease of life\". The treatment is one of the world's most expensive, with an official cost of £2.6m.\n\nWhen you cut yourself, the body senses the injury and activates a series of clotting proteins in the bloodstream. This makes the blood sticky at the site of the wound and then seals it with a clot. But from the day he was born, Elliott was unable to make enough clotting factor IX (nine). Without this crucial clotting component, bleeds are bigger and longer. Bleeds also happen spontaneously inside joints - such as the knee or elbow - causing long-term damage. Elliott, who is 34 and from Colchester, rebelled against his diagnosis as a child by sneakily playing rugby or skateboarding. But any injury risked a damaging bleed, like when he was tackled playing football. \"I got studs right across the shin and that came up like a cartoon, like Tom and Jerry,\" he said. Elliott needed injections of factor IX twice a week - and more if he was injured - for 29 years. \"I would have to think about it all the time,\" he said.\n\nElliott Collins Elliott Collins is one of a handful of people to have been treated with the gene therapy during the clinical trials\n\nBut he took part in trials of the gene therapy when it was still just an experimental idea in 2019. Since then, he has not needed any factor IX injections and says it has transformed his life. He told me: \"I don't think you can go through something like that for 29 years, for it to completely disappear and not change someone mentally and physically. \"I feel cured.\" He knew it was working when he clattered his knee into a cupboard. He whacked it hard enough to balloon up and need a factor IX injection, but instead he watched as only a small mark appeared. \"That solidified [the realisation] this is real, this is working and I can relax a bit.\" Tests showed that levels of factor IX in Elliott's blood had gone from nothing to 60% of normal.\n\nHow it works\n\nGetty Images The gene therapy uses a virus to \"infect\" Elliott's liver with DNA containing the ability to make factor IX\n\nElliot was born with a mutation in his DNA - his genetic code - that meant his body's instructions for making factor IX were faulty. So doctors gave him engineered viruses that contained copies of the fully functional factor IX instructions. The viruses act like a fleet of microscopic postmen, delivering those blueprints to the liver. The organ is then able to manufacture the clotting protein. It was a one-off infusion, lasting about an hour, that Elliott is benefiting from five years later. Not everybody will have as good a response as Elliott. In trials on 54 men, two still needed to take factor IX injections. And nobody knows how long it will last - some trials have suggested more than a decade. \"I'm very aware of the fact that this is new, I'm almost preparing myself for it to potentially wear off to avoid any kind of major disappointment,\" Elliott says.\n\nHow can the NHS afford it?\n\nUncertainty over how long patients benefit makes it hard to know whether the gene therapy is worth the money. Normal clotting factor injections cost between £150,000 and £200,000 per patient per year for life. But the gene therapy - branded Hemgenix - has an official list price of £2.6m. Elliott says it's \"wild to think that’s how much it costs\" and now he had multi-million pound blood he should \"probably get life insurance\". The treatment is being made available through a deal between the company CSL Behring, NHS England and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, the body that rules on cost-effectiveness. I have pressed all the parties involved for details of the deal, but it is bound up in confidentiality agreements. As I understand it, the NHS will track how much patients benefit for more than a decade and that will dictate how much CSL Behring are paid. If factor IX levels dip earlier than expected, then the NHS will pay less. It is essentially performance-related pay for drugs and it is the first such deal the NHS has agreed. The therapy will be available immediately at eight centres - Oxford, Manchester, Leeds, Bristol, Birmingham, Cambridge and two in London. Around 2,000 people in the UK have haemophilia B and the NHS anticipates treating 250 of them. Not everyone will be suitable for the gene therapy as some are too young or have other health conditions that rule them out. Prof Sir Stephen Powis, the NHS national medical director, said the \"transformative\" gene therapy could be \"truly life-changing\" and had been secured \"at an affordable price\".\n\n'Real milestone'\n\nHaemophilia runs in families. Elliott's younger brother was six days old when he died of a brain bleed. His great-uncle died from the condition at the age of 14. Those with haemophilia, mostly but not exclusively men, pass the affected genes onto their daughters who become carriers. This therapy will not change that genetic inheritance so it is not considered a true \"cure\". But Kate Burt, chief executive of the Haemophilia Society, said it was a \"real milestone\". \"It is life-transforming at its most effective, it can last for decades and put the bleeding disorder into complete remission.\" Similar gene therapies are being developed for haemophilia A, which is more common and affects nearly 9,000 people in the UK.

    "New mpox strain in DR Congo 'most dangerous yet'": "New mpox strain in DR Congo 'most dangerous yet'\n\n26 June 2024 By Philippa Roxby , Health reporter Share\n\nReuters Mpox, formerly called monkeypox, is a viral infection and can be deadly\n\nA new strain of the mpox virus spreading quickly along the eastern border of Democratic Republic of Congo is \"incredibly worrying\", say health officials monitoring its spread. The virus, which can cause lesions across the whole body, is making some people very ill and can be deadly. The current outbreak has been driven by sexual transmission but there is evidence this strain can also be passed on through close skin-to-skin contact. Global health experts say the new variant risks cross-border and international spread of the virus, with one calling it the \"most dangerous strain yet\". A worldwide epidemic of mpox in 2022 was brought under control by vaccinating vulnerable groups. But there is poor access to vaccines and treatments in DR Congo and local health officials are warning the virus could reach other countries. \"The disease can go through airports. A person with lesions can go through borders because there are no controls,\" said Leandre Murhula Masirika, at the health department in South Kivu province - one of the worst affected areas in DR Congo. \"I'm very afraid it's going to cause more damage.\"\n\n'Risk of spread'\n\nCases of mpox, formerly called monkeypox, have been on the rise in the African country for decades. Official figures from the World Health Organization (WHO) show there have been nearly 8,000 cases this year in DR Congo, including 384 deaths - almost half of these among children under 15. An outbreak in South Kivu province, near the border with Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda, is causing particular concern. Lab testing of virus samples from the area recently found the new mpox strain, which contains mutations that appear to help it circulate among humans. In the mining town of Kamituga, where the strain is thought to have originated among sex workers in September 2023, cases are rising. Those now being infected include schoolchildren, healthcare workers treating mpox patients and entire households. The new strain has been detected in several cities along the border, including Goma, which borders Rwanda. The WHO said it represented \"a renewed risk of cross-border and international spread which may potentially lead to an increased risk of severe illness\".\n\nReuters A six-year-old girl with mpox in an outbreak in DR Congo in 2022\n\nScientists briefing journalists about the current outbreak said they feared the new strain was being spread more easily, causing more serious disease and more deaths in children and adults. There is also concern over the risk of asymptomatic spread between people who do not have symptoms and are unaware they have the virus. The current case figures are \"the tip of the iceberg\", said Prof Trudie Lang, professor of global health research at the University of Oxford. \"It's definitely the most dangerous strain yet. \"We don’t know how many non-severe cases are hidden.\" It is also not clear how fast the new strain spreads or whether current vaccines will protect against it. Trials will be needed to work this out, which will take time. The global outbreak of mpox that spread across Europe and America in 2022 was sexually transmitted and driven by men who have sex with men. It was caused by the Clade II mpox virus. The new strain is from the more deadly Clade I but is distinct from other outbreaks which have previously affected the region. It can also be spread through non-sexual contact, which makes it more dangerous. Many children have been infected, including newborn babies during pregnancy. There have been reports of a small number of infected pregnant women miscarrying their babies. And some patients have been left with long-term complications with their eyes, skin and genitals. One healthcare worker looking after an infected patient is reported to have lost her sight after becoming infected herself. In cases in DR Congo to date, the new strain has a mortality rate of 4% in adults and 10% in children.\n\nPoor access to vaccines",

CC-BY-ND Taking inspiration from human skin ligaments, the prototype face can be made to smile\n\nJapanese scientists have found a way to attach living skin to robot faces, for more realistic smiles and other facial expressions. The breakthrough came from copying tissue structures in people, according to the team at Tokyo University. The prototype may appear more Haribo than human-like. But the researchers say it paves the way to making convincingly realistic, moving humanoids with self-healing skin that will not easily rip or tear.\n\n©2024 Takeuchi et al. CC-BY-ND Scientists say their new method can work on complex, curved and even moving surfaces\n\nThe artificial skin is made in the lab, using living cells. Not only is it soft, like real skin but it can repair itself if cut, the scientists say. Past attempts to attach it proved difficult, though. The team tried using mini hooks as anchors - but those damaged the skin as the robot moved. In people, the skin is tethered to underlying structures by ligaments - tiny ropes of flexible collagen and elastin. To recreate that, the researchers drilled lots of little holes into the robot and applied a gel containing collagen, and then the layer of artificial skin on top. The gel plugs the holes and tethers the skin to the robot.\n\nPlastic surgery",
    "What is mpox and how do you catch it?": "What is mpox and how is it spread?\n\n26 June 2024 Share\n\nReuters Outbreaks in DR Congo have affected children as well as adults\n\nA new strain of the mpox virus is spreading quickly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and experts say it is the most dangerous variant they have seen. Mpox, which used to be called monkeypox, is endemic in parts of west and central Africa and cases have been on the rise on the continent for decades. In 2022, a worldwide epidemic of mpox affected Europe, Australia, the US and many other countries.\n\nHow common is mpox?\n\nMpox disease is caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe. The virus was originally transmitted from animals to humans, and is more common in countries close to tropical rainforests. In these regions, there are thousands of cases and hundreds of deaths from the disease every year - with children under the age of 15 worst affected. There are two main strains of the virus known to exist. The milder one caused a global outbreak in 2022 which spread to nearly 100 countries that do not usually see the virus. The second, more deadly strain is endemic in central Africa - it is behind the new recently discovered strain in DR Congo. The two types carry different risks of disease and mortality.\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nGetty Images Mpox, or monkeypox, is spread through close contact with infected people\n\nInitial symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain and aching muscles. Once the fever breaks, a rash can develop, often beginning on the face then spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The rash, which can be extremely itchy or painful, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The lesions can cause scarring. The infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days. Serious cases can see lesions attack the whole of the body, and especially the mouth, eyes and genitals.\n\nHow is it spread?\n\nMpox spreads from person to person through close contact with someone who is infected - including through sex, skin-to-skin contact and talking or breathing close to another person. The virus can enter the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract or through the eyes, nose or mouth. It can also be spread through touching objects which have been contaminated by the virus, such as bedding, clothing and towels. Close contact with infected animals, such as monkeys, rats and squirrels, is another route. During the global outbreak in 2022, the virus spread mostly through sexual contact. The current DR Congo outbreak is being driven by sexual contact, but has also been found in other communities.\n\nWho is most at risk?\n\nGetty Images There are vaccines which protect against severe mpox\n\nMost cases are often found in people who are sexually active and men who have sex with men. People with several partners or new sexual partners can be most at risk. But anyone who has close contact with someone with symptoms can catch the virus, including health workers and family members. Advice is to avoid close contact with anyone with mpox and clean your hands with soap and water if the virus is in your community. Those who have mpox should isolate from others until all their lesions have disappeared. Condoms should be used as a precaution when having sex for 12 weeks after recovery, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.\n\nHow can it be treated?",
    "India heat: Inside Delhi's first emergency room to tackle crisis": "Inside India's first heat stroke emergency room\n\n19 June 2024 By Soutik Biswas , @soutikBBC, India correspondent Share\n\nEPA A construction worker drinks water during the heatwave in Delhi\n\nIn one of the largest hospitals in India’s capital, Delhi, a physician says he has never seen anything like this before. “This is an unprecedented heatwave. In my 13 years of working here, I don’t remember signing a death certificate for heat stroke. This year, I’ve signed several,” says Ajay Chauhan of the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital (RMLH). Delhi has been reeling under a prolonged heatwave, with daily temperatures crossing 40C (104F) since May, peaking at nearly 50C. Humidity and hot winds exacerbate the heat, compounded by water shortages and power outages due to soaring demand. And people are dying from the heat, with media reports suggesting at least 20 fatalities due to heat-related illnesses. A heat stroke, the most severe heat illness, is identified by three key signs: exposure to high heat and humidity, a core body temperature of 40.5C (105F) or higher, and mental changes like mild confusion or impaired consciousness. Heat stroke is also a silent killer, and victims can begin to fall ill hours after exposure to sun. India's National Centre for Disease Control calls heat strokes a \"life-threatening\" condition with a mortality rate of 40-64%. Since Dr Chauhan's hospital in Delhi opened a heat stroke clinic in late May, seven people have died of heat stroke and more than 40 have been treated for heat-related ailments.\n\nAFP Ajay Chauhan, head of the Delhi heat stroke clinic, says he has never seen so many patients\n\nThe majority were men working outdoors and in small, unregulated factories with poor conditions, enduring extreme heat exposure. To be sure, the heatwave is not restricted to Delhi: dozens have died from heat-related illnesses since March, with more than 50 deaths in just three days in early June in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Odisha. At the RMLH clinic, possibly the first of its kind in India, the effort to save heat stroke patients underscores the challenge posed by rapid climate and health emergencies. A few days ago, a man was wheeled in with body temperatures soaring to 42C (107.7F). A body’s normal core temperature is 37-38C. He was suffering from a heat stroke. At this temperature, a human body begins to shut down, cells deteriorate, and there’s a risk of organ failure. Sweating ceases as blood flow to the skin stops, leaving it cold and clammy. At the clinic, doctors dunked the patient into the icy waters of a 250-litre ceramic tub where the temperature ranges from 0 to 5C. (The clinic is equipped with two ceramic tubs, a 200kg ice-making machine, rectal thermometers, ice boxes and inflatable tubs.) The patient took about 25 minutes to cool down and begin recovering before he was moved to the ward for further treatment.\n\nReuters A patient suffering from heat exhaustion being wheeled into a hospital in Ahmedabad\n\n“Early cooling saves lives. Every second counts,” says Dr Chauhan. A delay can either prove to be fatal or leave the patient bleeding, or with damaged kidneys and liver. It is not difficult to fall ill in Delhi. Life is tough. A third of residents live in substandard and congested housing. The city’s 6,400-odd slums, home to more than a million households, lack adequate cooling and face seasonal livelihood crises. Men fall ill working outdoors; women fall sick after spending extended periods in kitchen settings with traditional stoves. Green spaces are scarce. In the peak of summer, the city turns into a scorching furnace, trapped between the blazing heat from above and the searing ground below. Anjana Kumari, the wife of a daily wage worker admitted at RHML with heat stroke, told The Indian Express that their slum hutment's only fan wasn’t working due to a power cut. Her husband, exhausted from working all day on Monday, couldn't sleep and later suffered seizures, vomiting, and diarrhoea. She rushed him to the hospital at night. “Doctors have told me he won't be able to walk for some time and need a lot of care,” Ms Kumari said. Those who work outdoors suffer the most. A large majority of respondents in a new Greenpeace survey on how heat impacts street vendors in Delhi reported health issues due to hot weather. Irritability was the most common (73.44%), followed by headaches, dehydration, sunburn, fatigue and muscle cramps. Most faced challenges accessing medical care due to lack of money.\n\nAFP At the Delhi heat stroke clinic, patients are dunked into ceramic tubs of icy water\n\n“The heat increases every day. We are living under the open sky. What resources can I gather? If possible, there should be some trees and plants nearby, so that fresh air keeps blowing and the body gets some relief,” Guddi, a sugarcane juice vendor who operates a manual crusher, told Greenpeace. “After being exposed to the heat of the sun all day, I don’t feel like eating dinner at night. All I can think about is stretching my legs and going to sleep,” she said. And all over India, people are falling sick due to the heat. A new nationwide survey by Centre for Rapid Insights (CRI) offers some startling insights into how heatwaves hurt people and cripple productivity. It showed that 45% of the households contacted reported at least one member getting sick from the heat last month. Among those affected, over 67% had household members sick for more than five days. This impact was particularly severe among the poorest. Specifically 32.5% of households with motorcycles and 28.2% with no vehicles had members ill for over five days; the figure was lower at 21.8% for households with cars.\n\nGetty Images There are more than 200,000 homeless people in Delhi, many of whom live in congested shelters in the sweltering heat"
