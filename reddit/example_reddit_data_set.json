The commonality of the reports seem to be that they have been trying to use the Android reddit app to post. So if this problem has been bugging you, please report it to Reddit in the android app store. Until it's fixed you can post your art in the web browser on a computer.\n\nAnd yes, we know the app seemingly allows posting on other subs, and not on /r/Art. But the iPhone app works fine (tested myself). It probably has to do with the title requirements that this sub has, it uses a thing called regex, and I suspect this title requirement is causing the android app to not function correctly.",

The first season is a slog and exactly what I expected the show to be, Dollar General X-Files...until we got to the Season 1 finale, which was incredible. Season 2 was more fun and then we got to the season 2 finale which was incredible. ETC.\n\nThe set-up/payoff is probably better than any show I've ever seen. (Miles to go, little miss muffet counting down from 7-3-0)\n\nAnd then we got to episodes like, \"Hush\", \"Restless\", \"The Body\", \"Once More With Feeling\", and \"Conversations with Dead People\".\n\nThat show is so much more than it's goofy title and a monster-of-the-week. I feel like they said, \"what if we combine 'All My Children' with the moral complexity of Kurt Vonnegut combined with the horror of, 'The Twilight Zone' and use it to heavily explore depression, feminism, and what makes a life meaningful\".\n\nAnyway!
