I mean, they're pretty dependent on their old stuff to bring back players. That means their new stuff aren't that interesting. And if they keep on doing that, it's gonna be repetitive since it's the same stuff over and over. If OG Fortnite came back rarely so often, then the hype would still be high.

            "Yeah, I exclusively play ZB these days and played the hell out of OG.  I thought it worked perfectly fine.  None of the \u201cthe map wasn\u2019t designed for ZB\u201d worries panned out.  Best time I\u2019ve had playing Fortnite since early C2.",
            "I never experienced that, myself, but I did have a game where me and last guy were shooting at eachother from across a ridge, near Tilted Towers. Eventually, he had to move cause zone favored my side of the ridge over his, and because there wasn\u2019t a way to get up to me, he ended up dying in storm.",
            "So what's your problem?",
            "Why is it stupid?\n\nIf they don't split it, ZB players aren't going to play it anyway. So there's no population impact.",
            "Why is it stupid? Because you said so?",
            "I was more referring to like original Fortnite though. LTM - food fight, 50v50, floor is llava, team rumble, disco domination etc. I didn't fall in love with Legos or rocket racing. I fell in love with the core of Fortnite! I hear what you're saying though. They've just relied on Creative to fill that niche, and it hasn't imo.",
            "Festival is very fun, but only for like 1 song i like every time i even decide to play fortnite at all",
            "Haven\u2019t played since about day three of twisted metal.  Plan on giving the mode a shot.",
            "Interesting! Sounds pretty cool",
            "I think season 3 was the nail in the coffin for chapter 5 ngl",
            "If you climb a bit more, you'll start seeing why cars are still stupid. Every endgame is a campfest with a dozen cars hiding behind hard cover. You're also gonna start getting matched with Unreals in ZB, so knock out your ranked quests asap before it becomes a complete slog",
            "Again, it\u2019s different, but I wouldn\u2019t say there is one \u201creal version of Fortnite\u201d.\n\nOG is probably your preferred version, but if the current version isn\u2019t \u201cReal Fortnite\u201d because it\u2019s different, you can make the argument that Zero Build isn\u2019t \u201cReal Fortnite\u201d, or Save the World isn\u2019t \u201cReal Fortnite\u201d, even though STW literally came before.\n\nAnd if you believe STW is the real version, even BR can\u2019t be considered \u201cReal Fortnite\u201d.",
            "i respect everyone's opinion tbh, but it does seem to be a little weird how in chapter 1 when there was no bots, and i was like 12 years old playing season 3, id look up to true getting a 20 bomb.\nnow anyone's first game they get like 15 bot kills.\nso its changed for the worst kinda, bc people don't have to try anymore",
            "Did Fortnite say that?",
            "Congrats to you and the 13 other people who preferred this",
            "That and the UI sucks ass, as someone who spends a lot of time in the locker, I find it nearly impossible to maneuver. Cosmetics in the game are arguably just as important to gameplay to me. Fortnite wouldn\u2019t have the playerbase it has now if they didn\u2019t have skins. I\u2019ve seen a lot of players join the game solely because they added Goku or Peter Griffin",
            "playtesting and qa?",
            "You can see it on YouTube lmao, and that\u2019s with single developers who aren\u2019t copying old locations. Remember, Epic\u2019s a big studio with hundreds of developers",
            "I'm speaking for me. The start of this season is some of the most fun I've had playing Fortnite. People who complained about that (in my opinion because apparently you need qualifiers for everything) don't like fun.",
            "[removed]",
            "Imagine they make reload ch 2 next June, with like idk\u2026 Weird Al concert? It\u2019ll happen! Eventually!",
            "Yikes",
            "I figured once they hit OG 4 or 5 they'd have to start remixing and rehashing the later seasons from earlier chapters, the ones they didn't do for the original OGs.\n\nBut maybe you're right, maybe this is how they plan on keeping the 'old map' around.",
            "Same thing, less legal trouble.",
            "I hate it but I think you\u2019re right. They can\u2019t accept no one cares about their crappy metaverse they\u2019re trying to do",
            "Cool. Then you could play regular Fortnite instead of playing the OG gamemode. Aren\u2019t options nice?",
            "You are in the vast minority",
            "No. Rocket racing is the only one that is failing. The other modes are thriving and have more daily players then most other games in their genres. Fortnite festival brought the rhythm game genre back to life after being dead for years and Lego is Lego. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only reason why OG did well is because it was the first time it was brought back but if you look up the player counts for BR during that time, they dropped back to pre OG season levels 2 weeks into November and stayed there. If it already seen a decline that quick in November, any OG themed game mode will probably die out completely in 2 months. That shit was boring and will always be boring again and again every time they bring it back",
            "Basically true, but building wasn't what it is now back then, even in ZB it felt like OG Fortnite to me.",
            "You should have looked around before you went any further. The current map is much worse, there are so many details on the screen that the game is similar to the game \"find an item among a bunch of others\". it is impossible to look around, the game turns into a complete random.",
            "I have no issue. I said the word 'builds'. All of the build haters are screeching. Go ask them. The reactions are hilarious.",
            "Because they tried to do something like this in ZB a few chapters ago. It sucked and Epic pulled the mode completely.",
            "I mainly played ranked for the chainsaw pickaxe which I have now. Most cars I encounter are easy to handle, throw 2 emps. (1 disables the car, the 2nd get rid of all their shield), or fist up to high ground and spray the car, or guitar away.",
            "adding bots makes the game more accessible to more casual players that don\u2019t have time to play fortnite everyday, bots are the reason this game is still mainstream to a wide audience of people even if you don\u2019t agree with me\ud83d\ude2d",
            "With bot lobbies and sbmm it just feels like a lot of people feel entitled to get wins.  I remember how exciting it was to get my first win in chapter 1 and how long it took.  Now people are winning their first game ever touching fortnite.",
            "Well, the mode's implementation in Warzone and Apex very much requires teammates to make it work. I wouldn't be surprised if it's the same here. Separate lobbies for solos, duos, and squads would also split the player base.",
            "It's literally copied and pasted from Warzone",
            "I want to see u/Shack691 's new map and mode that he made in 2 weeks.",
            "I love how you say this right after they lost a massive court case that is now legally requiring them to say when items are leaving the shop lol",
            "lol. They seem to be doing fine? I have to believe they are doing whatever they feel will make them the most money.",
            "yes it is, I just don't see perma og being that popular.\n\npeople have tried making clone OG maps before... the players dip hard, I can't really see this having much staying power.... at least longterm that is.\n\nbut if epics doing this map then it will do numbers.",
            "For sure.  I think having stared in the middle of chapter 2 makes me less susceptible to the nostalgia.",
            "Maybe but they had to litter the map with zip lines specifically because almost all the high ground on the map was fully inaccessible without building",
            "time for an optometrist appointment",
            "Man, you are insufferable.",
            "I'm glad bots exist. My dad sucks at shooters but he plays Fortnite every single evening precisely because bot lobbies allow him to have fun. Fun is what gaming is all about.",
            "You are the only person in existence who liked fracture",
            "Apparently not because the player count is as low as it\u2019s ever been. Who knows how low it would be if they didn\u2019t have season OG bring a bunch of people back. No one is falling for this metaverse crap",
            ">if epics doing this map then it will do numbers\n\nAye, that\u2019s the difference. I\u2019m not playing some janky Creative clone, but Epic dropping an official BR mode is something I\u2019ll play.\n\nI think it\u2019ll be more popular than you think. The narrative of \u201cOG is only popular because of nostalgia\u201d simply isn\u2019t true, it\u2019s a more balanced and more fun game than Ch. 5. I suppose we\u2019ll see in the end \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
            "Because those player made maps in Creative are extremely limited. They aren\u2019t able to fully recreate the OG experience as of now. We saw how popular OG really is when Epic brought it back in November and it broke the record for player count.",
            "Which was the biggest difference, people didn't really build fight back then, to the average player a double ramp rush was insane building, most players just built little \"forts\", which is how the game was designed to be played, and in OG ZB we had so many pop a forts about, that it had a very similar dynamic to actual OG Fortnite.",
            "as a build player i gotta agree lol this guy is just as insufferable as the build haters \ud83d\udc80",
            "To each their own, for sure.  To me, competing is fun.",
            "What are you even talking about?",
            "When people say the player count is as low as its ever been, is that just BR? I'm just wondering if, including creative and all the other modes but made by epic and just fan made... If maybe fortnite itself is still just as big if not bigger, but just not the BR? That would at least explain why epic wouldn't care as much about the BR losing steam. \n\nThing is though, I love chapter 5 and this season is the best one in a long while for me.",
            "Is there anything more subjective then how \"fun\" something is?",
            "Yeah, I was just mostly pointing out that it was a massive difference because it means that without those zip lines, ZB players literally wouldn't be able to play the OG map",
            "I think competing's fun to everyone! And bots fulfil that desire; they make it possible for anyone, regardless of skill level, to actually compete, as a win in a bot lobby is still considered a win by the game. Now, I personally don't find a bot lobby win as satisfying as a win in a comp round, but it does allow people like my dad to fight at their own level and still experience the gratification of a Victory Royale.\n\nThat doesn't devalue our wins; it really just enables theirs.",
            "Is reading a problem for you?",
            "Reading something that's completely irrelevant to the discussion? Yes."
