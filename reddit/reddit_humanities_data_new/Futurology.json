            "This whole story seems remarkably unlikely to me. An ai \u201cmovie\u201c already written, funded, cast, shot, additive, and found the screening?? And then enough people heard about it. That hundreds of people protested at this one theater? Something smells really fishy about this story. Maybe they wrote the story in anticipation of something that MIGHT happen in the future. Maybe they are using the word \u201cmovie\u201c very loosely? Maybe it was a little short like you might see it at film festival? That I might believe.",
            "Out of many outcomes in this situation this is probably one of the more stupid ones. It should have been allowed to be screened. \n\nIf it were to be bad then anti-AI crowd would be happy.\n\nIf it would be good then cancelling such movies would only delay the inevitable.\n\nThe option chosen is basically saying \"people are affraid it might actually be good\". People's fear won't stop this technology from rolling out - it does make them look stupid though and delays neccesary discussions that need to be had about this kind of things.",

            "I'm imagining it was something like interdimensional cable.",
            "I mean until an AI can make a decision to be script writer it is just a tool used by humans. Someone told it what to do. Someone probably edited it after that. And thousands or millions of people contributed to allowing the AI to accomplish the task is the first place. These people trying to hold back progress seem a little unhinged to me.",
            "It seems to me that every time technology automates a job, reducing the number of people required to do it, there have been protests from people. It also seems that this often only serves to delay the implementation of the automation.\n\nI don't see this as fundamentally different to building a machine to thresh wheat or using robots to build cars. There was previously the belief that people in creative fields were immune to this but it seems that they are in the same boat as the rest of us.\n\nI'm far from an expert but I believe that AI will win out. I have very little doubt about that. It's simply too useful to reduce the time and effort required to produce something.",

            "Yeah because all the movies released by humans are Shakespearean",
            "It's so ridiculous that people honestly think the regular consumer would notice or give a shit if a script is AI generated. \n\nThe sooner we accept AI and the changes it introduces, the sooner we can work on making these changes actually benefit everyone and not just the people that own said AI.",
            "We're going to have AI doing all the art and humanities stuff while we go work in the fields, huh.",
            "This kinda shit is why, once I make a game with AI, I'm going to hide that the art was AI generated as best I can.\n\nArtists forcing AI artists into hiding by attacking them is going to make ot impossible for anyone to know what is or isn't AI. And artists will inevitably attack, and have already attacked, other real artists accusing them of using AI as a result of that. Fools.\n\nIf they simply accepted AI as a tool, and Steam didn't ban AI because of them crying about it, we wouldn't have to hide, and no artists would get falsely accused.",

            "I hope this only affects crap like super hero movies, the monster soda of art",
            "Release it so that people can see just how horrible and obvious it is.\n\nThat way people collectively can see and understand that the potential they claim A.I. has isn\u2019t truly there and that it\u2019s being overblown. \n\nThat\u2019s probably more so the reason why it was cancelled people will know too easily and the jig will be up.\n\nLike when game companies lied left and right about A.i. in video games being unbeatable until people caught on. \n\nlol the only thing happening today is that people aren\u2019t catching on fast enough. \n\nAnd The ones that do, get ridiculed and downvoted for pointing it out.",

            "I wonder if people had an actual working 'Holodeck' would they object?",
            "Why the outrage? Do people actually believe that current movies are **not** scripted by AI? If not completely, then at least partially? It's the same concepts over & over again. I haven't seen a really original movie in years.",
            "No way! People dont want lazy excuses for movies made to make as much money as possible with the barest amount of effort!? Im shocked! Shocked I tell you!",

            "It was a direct to VHS script anyway",
            "It got a lot of press before it was cancelled. Not doubt it perhaps got more. It\u2019s a very small time product, I\u2019m not sure it will ever get released. If it does it won\u2019t have much impact.",

Here's something y'all can look at for the future regarding ai, if it comes to you in shades of purple and magenta, it's probably got military industrial complex strings on it....",

            "My number one gripe with film and tv is always the writing. As a fan, I just don\u2019t see myself enjoying a movie made with an AI script, I already shit on most scripts written by real people with better imaginations than AI. I\u2019ve seen what AI comes up with and it is almost all trash, I\u2019m not worried.",
            "I know right, like just don't go.",
            "The reason ***I*** fear the use of this tech is a little phenomenon I'm going to label \"average Joe's blinders.\"  And I can best illustrate it through example.\n\nI am very irritated by the tendency of the editor for _Mad Max Fury Road_ and _Furiosa_ to take a clip that was filmed at 24fps, and tweak its framerate slightly up, to something like 30fps or whatever.  They do this to speed up the action of a scene that was too slow in real life.  Why do I hate it?  Because the way they accomplish this is by discarding frames.  6 frames every second, gone.  This causes a visible stutter in the filmed footage.  *Blip, blip, blip!*\n\nYou can see this in action in the _Furiosa_ trailer here: https://youtu.be/XJMuhwVlca4?t=114  The shot of the car backing up through a gate.  If you don't see it, pause the video at the beginning of that scene and scroll through it frame by frame with the , and . keys.  Keep an eye on the rocks on the right, which _should_ be scrolling at a fixed rate.  But it's not fixed, because frames have been discarded at a weird cadence.  It looks just like when a video game is lagging due to the hardware not being able to keep up.\n\nSo what does this have to do with AI?  This: _Most people don't see this going on._  That's why they get away with it.  But it bothers the everliving hell out of _me._\n\nThat's what's going to happen with AI.  It's going to scrape that uncanny valley _constantly,_ and most people won't pick up on the little moments of weirdness, so they'll get away with it, but it will essentially ruin the experience to me and anyone else who notices.",
            "Is it unreasonable for people to want to avoid setting a precedent of allowing screenings of movies generated by the plagiarism machine? I'd rather leave the lid on that can of worms on as long as possible to continue enjoying good cinema before the industry collapses more than it already has.",
            "There's a weird hard on that non-creatives get from AI. It's like they can look at entire group of people who have trained their entire lives in a craft and say to them \"AI is Inevitable\". It's like they get a kick out of some sort of deranged \"Thanos\" mentality. Nevermind that these machines were trained on stolen property. Whatever gives you this perceived modicum of power you temporarily weild is more valuable than that. Every piece of meaningful media has been created by a soul with a struggle. Whatever you think will emerge from this bastardization of human experience will inevitably ring empty. AI doesn't have a point of view, it has no human experience. It doesn't matter if it mimics a convincing conflict, you will know it was made by a mindless machine and thus, feel no real connection to it.",
            "I feel like this problem would not be so bad if it weren't for the fact that so many movies now are so formulaic and based on existing IP and tropes. I'd bet an AI could write an acceptable Transformers movie -- acceptable in terms of it not being noticeably worse than the previous half dozen. I don't think it would be able to write Interstellar. But most movies are on Transformers' level, not Interstellar's.",
            "It's the same as why they won't admit it with the Rings of Power. If AI gets a reputation for writing stinkers, they won't be able to get AI projects greenlit.\n\nIf it's bad, the anti- crowd is happy, but also it gets put on the shelf for a few decades.",
            "Sorry the only acceptable reaction currently is AI = bad\n\n/s",
            "I'm not afraid of AI content being good. I am not interested in consuming media created by a souless AI that has never experienced anything real. There is nothing to relate to and anything seemingly done well will be due to the stolen recycled data used to train the AI. \n\nAI can be a useful tool but it's rarely used in that way. Having AI generate an entire script is not using it as a tool.",
            "> delay the inevitable\n\nPeople always say this every time anything new happens, but what's inevitable here? That every movie will be written by AI? Viewers already seem pretty unfriendly to that.",
            "Who the fuck cares? If it's good then that's a huge win for humanity. If it sucks then no one will watch or listen anyway.",
            "it'll be just like the \"CGI free\" movies",
            "It was probably a masterpiece, why else would the peons not want us to see it. No way humans will do better than AI in the long term.",
            "Will strikes or protests actually work?  \n\nOutsourcing ruffled feathers in each industry affected, but the common, replaceable Western worker was powerless because it was never going to be acceptable State policy to punish outsourcing, because outsourcing included economies that we wanted to woo away from the Soviets by giving them access to our market.\n\nWill the State have an incentive to save voter's jobs if those voters are becoming obsolete because robots and algorithms are replacing the voter's role in the economy and State defense? If the State thinks that the robots can make artillery shells and fire them at an algorithm defined target, the State may well start looking at the cost of the bots vs the cost of the voter.",
            "Robots SHOULD take jobs. NOT those that stem from the human experience. Robots should make parts; people should make art.\n\nIf there is an AI writing a movie script while there are still people in coal mines, then WE FUCKED UP. The plot of The Matrix is \"humans are batteries so robots can craft an imaginary world\". Why are we making that reality?",
            "We need to seize the means of automation.\n\nI remember being little and looking forward to a future were humans don't have to work basically, since robots and AI do everything and we can focus on actually enjoying ourselves.\n\nThe only reason people fear automation and AI is because they don't have UBI and similar security mechanism, due to capitalist interferences.",
            "Refusing to work because you're afraid of being replaced seems like a bad idea",
            "Except laws and lawsuits are coming down the pipes-- all AI generated content will eventually have to be labeled such by law.",
            "My thoughts exactly.\n\nThen if it\u2019s good you reveal it later to the haters\u2019 disgust, lol.",
            "If you think now is a lot wait 3 years. My advice: get used to it because it\u2019s going to rock every facet of our entire world\u00a0",
            "What do you think an acceptable number of people not going is?\n\nEnough people said they'd never go to this movie. That's why it's canceled.",
            "Well, this time really is a little different. Because there will likely be no where for displaced workers to migrate this time. There\u2019s no \u201cretraining\u201d this go around buddy. Because any new job a human could do, the same AIs will be able to do as well. Meaning that even these supposed \u201cnew jobs\u201d that AI is supposedly going to create (which is a myth in itself) will *also* be vulnerable to the same AI automation that killed the old jobs. \n\nPrevious automations were merely one tool being replaced by another. (Meanwhile the human operating the tools remained safe from replacement). But this time, it\u2019s the human as a whole being being made obsolete. This will be the first time in history that something like that happens. So in reality, the past is irrelevant here. History doesn\u2019t always repeat itself.",
            "if people got more money as a result of it, there would be a lot less issues. but we live in capitalism. automation does not serve us, it serves the company. they pay less people, they make more money, we have less jobs and we need jobs because automation doesn't help us at all",
            "Why are we automating art?",
            "The big difference these days is the AI is built from stealing vast quantities of art. There's quite a difference between inventing something that makes a profession obsolete and stealing their work and cutting them out",

            "I see this argument a lot, but here's the thing. AI cannot be inspired. It simply copies and obeys an algorithm. When humans are inspired, they take that inspiration, mix it with other inspirations, then add something original. The final product is greater than the sum of its parts because human creativity *iterated* on the inspiration. This is true across all art mediums: film, visual art, music, theater, etc.\n\nAI, though? It doesn't iterate. It can only pull from what it knows. To make something even remotely resembling the human inspiration loop, one of two things will happen: A) human artists will intervene at some point and actually move things forward with creativity, defeating the need for AI in the first place or B) AI will start to cannibalize itself as it starts to learn and incorporate AI generated \"art\" into its learnset. This will spiral it down into unrecognizable slop for a few simple reasons:\n\nAI can identify patterns, but it doesn't actually *understand* them or know *why* things are the way that they are. AI may eventually recognize the structure of a song and be able to recreate an intro, verse, chorus, and ending and put them in the right places. But it doesn't know why they're there in the first place. So it can never really grow. AI can see a common chord progression and slap it in, but it doesn't know why the progression is successful or what it conveys. So it cannot creatively innovate on it or change it with *intent*.\n\nThe other reason is that art is inherently tied to the human experience. Once again, this applies to every single medium. AI doesn't and never truly will understand emotion (unless we get true AI and not the theft machines we have now), so it cannot make art that appeals to those emotions.\n\nAI can be a good tool for artists that know what they're doing to cut some of the most repetitive tasks from the creative process.

The AI would also need to identify when motion is stuttering unrealistically, as it does in that shot, and compensate for that on the fly.",
            "It's not about competition. It's about truth.\n\nArtists take inspiration from other artists all the time, but they strive to find their own unique voice. That's creation. That's the journey of any respectable artist. Are there those who plagrize? Yes. But they don't last long. My point is that there's an inherent emptiness in AI. And what's worse,  there are corporations and start ups selling this tech on the backs of a group of talented people who weren't paid very well to begin with. I don't get why people are so eager to stamp out the ambitions of raw human creativity. \n\nMy problem with AI is that it takes its stolen goods and uses them to show you what it thinks you want to see. When you ask chatgpt a question, it will do its best to tell you what you want to hear, even if it's a lie. AI art is a slot machine of plagerism and a syphon of human truth.

Real life adoption is a lot more complicated than \"people want X\" because it's actually really hard to know what people *actually* like about 'X', otherwise we'd all be drinking New Coke or whatever. AI will certainly find much easier applications as 'CGI 2.0' (well technically AI image generation is just CGI, but you get the point).",

And by doing that, they got rich enough to buy all our politicians so that no matter who we vote for, they\u2019re not incentivized to do anything but continue to sell us out.\n\nChanging a system this entrenched is going to take violence.

You could argue that making the food out of pink slime or whatever was more efficient, but people still rejected the idea in favor of something a little more natural. And that\u2019s going to be the case for certain AI uses. Even Sam Altman (one of people running OpenAI) said that humanity will reject certain uses of AI (while embracing others).

You've shot video at 24fps, and Miller, who is a complete psycho, says \"let's shift this entire scene half a frame forward\".\n\nSo you generate a midpoint frame between 1 and 2, and you generate a midpoint frame between 2 and 3, and you generate a midpoint frame between 3 and 4, and so forth.\n\nOnce you're done, none of the original frames exist in the final product. At the same time, the AI never had to fully conceptualize the scene, it just had to generate midpoints; it had a fully working reference document that just needed some tweaks.\n\nAll you really need to be able to do is hand it two (or more) frames, and say \"generate frame 17.884 from this\", and have it do that pretty reliably, and you can turn 24fps input video into any weird framerate or offset that you want.\n\nYou obviously *really* need to solve serious temporal artifacts.

I don't think this will happen soon.  I'm imagining something like the chaos of high-motion objects such as projectiles that traverse the frame in under 0.25 seconds, traveling smoke that is also billowing and expanding (think: a volcanic eruption, with the camera also shaking), and other cases where an understanding of what's actually going on would normally be indispensable.",

Plenty of people notice them.  There isn't an algorithm on the planet that can handle film grain well\u2014most of them give up and crush them out of existence; H.264/H.265 turn the grain into a temporal _crawl_ that is extremely conspicuous; instead of the grain being completely random from frame to frame, the algorithm tries its best to enforce the sense that each particle is actually moving around.\n\n> Remember that 0.25 seconds is 6 frames, even at 24fps. That's easy to deal with\n\nNo.  Maybe I wasn't descriptive enough.  An action scene with tons of its own motion vectors, with a projectile passing across in six frames, each individual specimen of the projectile seemingly disconnected because of the shutter speed.  If that's not doing it for you, change it to two frames.  The AI has only _two frames_ to work with.  A human will identify that something zipped by the camera super fast, but this will unavoidably be challenging for AI."

There are major escalations going on as of right now (Ukraine, Israel)\n\n**Cultural and Identity conflicts**\n\n* 1930s : Anti-Semitism, racism, and xenophobia were rampant, leading to discriminatory policies and violence.\n* Today : Similar cultural and identity conflicts are evident, with rising xenophobia, anti-immigrant sentiment, and ethnic tensions. There also seems to be a rise of \"anti-culture\"\n\n**Militarism and military spend**\n\n* 1930s : post WW1 conflict, there was an increased focus on militarism and military spend\n* Today : Global military expenditure has been rising to over 2 trillion and is constantly growing\n\nSome key differences that could help prevent further escalation\n\n* Organizations like UN, NATO and other regional instances should help in conflict prevention and resolution.\n* Large scale wars would be economically damaging to many involved parties as we have a highly interconnected world\n* Nuclear deterrence \n* Technology (although this could easily be seen as conflict facilitator)\n\nSo - are we seeing the same signals building up over time again?

            "1930's had weather induced agricultural issues that reduced the food supply, and increased the competition for food as to make the social unrest that much more acute.   \n\nE.g. Russians don't like Ukrainians then, or now.  In the 1930's though, there wasn't enough food to go around so the Soviets starved out the Ukrainians, took their grain because the Russians themselves were starving, and thus starved out the Ukrainians.   Now there is enough food, so it's just little pot shots at the Ukrainians.\n\nClimate change could lead to the extreme weather that caused the unrest of the 1930's, but we've got bigger and faster ships and trains to move grain hither and yon, to equalize local effects, and we're using petroleum based fertilizers and pumping ground water out of the ground at a higher rate rate, so the weather effects are lessened.  \n\nPopulation seems to be getting beyond what we can support even with our unsustainable farming, so this bickering over food is going to increase, but with the way the farming is unsustainable,  it will gradually decline, or the population is gradually growing to the amount of food we have available, so it isn't coming to a crisis as much as a slow burn.  \n\nWith luck, declining birth rates can mitigate the food pressure and we won't run into war, famine or pandemic,  but a declining population is something we haven't seen since the black plague except for little dips from the Spanish flu and a couple little conflicts so our economic systems etc. aren't adapted to it.   The adjustment away from an expectation of growth year after year, is going to cause some unrest, and require some changes to our economic systems.  The stock market can't keep going up, it is going to have to look more like Japan's lost decades.\n\nAnti-immigration is fundamentally about persevering our food supplies for ourselves.   It is a recognition that there's only so much land that can produce so much food, and if we let in more people, it'll be less food for us.    That goes along with the nationalism, \"this land is our land\"   \n\nOne of the good things that happened in the 1930's, in the US at least, was the rise of unions.   The common man taking a larger piece of the pie from the powers that be because the common man was starving otherwise, so the unions and the socialism was meant for a more equitable distribution of resources.

With Russia manifestly attacking different important centers in these countries, they need to get ready to defend themselves,\n\nThen there's Putin's decision to send his warships our way. If we had a real president, he would have sent the 7th Fleet to blockade the Russian navy, which wants to set up shop just south of Miami, in Venezuela and Cuba. Yes, this is very reminiscent of the Cuban missile crisis, except this time we have a weak, bumbling idiot of a president who doesn't understand that a show of force on our part is vitally necessary.\n\nThen there's China encircling Taiwan with its warships. A lot of people didn't pay attention when, shortly after Putin invaded Ukraine, Russia, China and North Korea formed a military alliance. This is deadly serious.\n\nJust one more thing, regarding your point about a renewed rise of anti-Semitism.

            "Or right after WW1. Cough, cough.",
            "I agree with this 100%.  Our current era is NOT analogous to the 1930s.  In the 30s, the world had just been shocked by a massive generational conflict, with widespread regime changes, territorial changes, loss of life, a deep cultural reckoning, and the Great Depression, with was far more severe than anything we've experienced since.\n\nRight now we have a world that has gotten so used to global peace (75+ years of proxy wars and prolonged territorial competition among the victors of WW2) that most people in rich countries assume they will never experience war.  In 1913, the European global powers hadn't seen a major major conflict since the War of 1870.  Multiple generations of kids had grown up without much fear of being drafted or experiencing an invasion.\n\nWe're at the tail end of a *massive* arms race and period technological advancement, similar to the end of the Victorian era.  Economically, it's very clear who the winners of that arms race have been, and how staggering their financial advantage is over the average person.  This has been the case for awhile, and people are a mix of restless and cynical about it, speaking very negatively about the status quo and experimenting with alternative societal models like socialism and fascism.\n\nBecause war hasn't been a part of most people's lives for a long time in richer countries, war-fueled traditions such as \"tough love\" for parenting or strict gender binaries are unpopular.  Men's violent and aggressive behavior is generally seen as highly offensive, and gentle and considerate behavior is seen as noble and desirable, whereas in the 1930s (or even the 1980s), it was the opposite.  Androgyny is celebrated, and there's also sort of a reactionary, performative masculinity movement that has nothing to do with the actual fighting that made \"trad masc\" so popular during the World Wars.\n\nSimilarly, aggressive politics and imperialism are highly unpopular.  A handful of empires have dominated global politics for a long time.  Most people aren't cheering on their home countries for taking territory from the enemy the way they did in the interwar period.  They're chastising their own governments for abusing power and being cruel to subjects, and demanding they relinquish territory freely for the sake of allowing colonies to be independent.  Ideas of world peace, that a dominant faction might actually weaken itself for the sake of fairness and unity with other groups, are actually being taken seriously and worked toward by some factions.  That's a very late stage peacetime mentality that you just wouldn't see if there had been a major war in the last few decades.\n\nNow I'm not really sure if that means there *will* be a big war anytime soon.  It could just as easily happen 20 years from now as tomorrow.  In the 1910s, people talked about the \"powder keg\" that was ready to blow.  Global tensions are certainly on the rise, and have been for a long time, but I am not sure if we are quite at that point where the pot is ready to boil over.  However, in 1914, I'm sure there were plenty of people who said the same thing, and were taken by surprise when Franz Ferdinand was assassinated, igniting World War I.",

            "That was awesome. Seems very applicable to today. Here is a ChatGPT summary of the cycle:\n\n\"The Fourth Turning: An American Prophecy\" by William Strauss and Neil Howe is a book that presents a theory of cyclical patterns in history. The core concepts of the book include:\n\n1. **Generational Cycles (Turnings)**:\n   - Strauss and Howe argue that history unfolds in cycles of approximately 80-100 years, which they call \"Saecula.\" Each Saeculum is divided into four \"Turnings,\" each lasting about 20-25 years.\n   - **First Turning (High)**: A period of prosperity and strong institutions, following a crisis. Society is unified and optimistic.\n   - **Second Turning (Awakening)**: A time of spiritual upheaval, where the emphasis shifts from building institutions to personal and spiritual development. This often leads to questioning the established order.\n   - **Third Turning (Unraveling)**: Institutions are increasingly seen as ineffective or corrupt, and individualism is strong. Society becomes more fragmented and values are less cohesive.\n   - **Fourth Turning (Crisis)**: A period of major upheaval and reconstruction, often involving wars or revolutions. This turning results in the destruction of old institutions and the creation of new ones, leading to the next High.\n\n2. **Generational Archetypes**:\n   - Each turning is characterized by four generational archetypes, which cycle in a fixed pattern. These are:\n     - **Prophet (Idealist)**: Born during a High, they grow up as indulged children during an Awakening, come of age as the moralistic leaders of a Crisis, and age into wise elders during a new High.\n     - **Nomad (Reactive)**: Born during an Awakening, they grow up as under-protected children during an Unraveling, come of age as the pragmatic leaders of a Crisis, and age into resilient elders during a new High.\n     - **Hero (Civic)**: Born during an Unraveling, they grow up as protected children during a Crisis, come of age as the collective heroes of a High, and age into powerful elders during an Awakening.\n     - **Artist (Adaptive)**: Born during a Crisis, they grow up as over-protected children during a High, come of age as sensitive young adults during an Awakening, and age into empathetic leaders during an Unraveling.\n\n3. **Historical Examples**:\n   - The authors provide historical examples to illustrate these cycles, such as:\n     - The American Revolution (Crisis), followed by the creation of a new political order (High).\n     - The Civil War (Crisis), followed by Reconstruction (High).\n     - The Great Depression and World War II (Crisis), followed by the post-war boom (High).\n\n4. **Predictions and Implications**:\n   - Strauss and Howe suggest that the United States was approaching a Fourth Turning (Crisis) at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, which would involve significant upheaval and transformation.\n   - They predict that the outcome of the Fourth Turning would be a reshaping of society, with new values and institutions emerging from the crisis.\n\nThe theory emphasizes that understanding these cycles and generational dynamics can provide insight into current events and help predict future trends. The authors argue that while the specifics of each turning and crisis differ, the patterns remain consistent across centuries.",

However, I feel like it's nonetheless a strong reason why (free and fair) democracies, even with flawed electoral systems, don't tend to get entirely dominated by one party or coalition as you'd intuitively assume they might be prone to.\n\nHence the fact that voters aren't acting rationally and have a negative bias may be required for democracies to function.

They also destroyed / degraded organized labor as one of the main goals of the Neo-liberal age.\n\nRoughly 8 years later, predictably, we get what they called the \"great recession\". This time, instead of letting the market punish the bad actors and crashing the economy, they printed money and baled them out! They avoided a full depression like meltdown by robbing the tax payers (I call it the great heist) - a perfect example of socializing the losses and privatizing the profits!\n\nThat lead to massive asset inflation and a huge wreath transfer from the lower classes to the top of society. And the bad actors became even more entrenched and bigger! Instead of being punished, they were rewarded!\n\nTo keep the dysfunctional system afloat, they had to print cheap money (low interest, quantitative easing etc) for over a decade - basically keep kicking the can down the road.\n\nThen came Covid which served as an accelerant - even more money printing, asset inflation etc. Resultant Inflation (tax on the poor) etc, post Covid, put an end to cheap money. Now, it was time for the working classes and asset poor to pay the price (austerity etc).\n\nBasically chickens are now coming home to roost and many of the means they were using to manage the systemic problems are no longer working or making matters worse.\n\nWith their back against the wall and economic and social pressures mounting, time to pivot to conflict and turmoil, usually the final arrow in their quiver.\n\nI finish my rambling with this quote ....\n\n\u201cNaturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America nor, for that matter, in Germany.

            "You are generally correct and I agree with most of what you said. There were several powder kegs in the early 1900s, with Russia and having been so important in the prior century in the wake of Napoleon, through 1848, only to find itself stuck in the past. Japan was on an expansion is streak with an 1899 war with China and then Russia in 1905. The dissolution of the ottoman empire was sparking nationalist fever in the balklands and Anatolia (Armenian genocide but also ethnic cleansing of Greeks.\n\nThere were a series of crisises before WWI, though. Multiple wars broke out in the Balklans, another in Morocco. I think there were a few reasons why the assassination of arch Duke Franz Ferdinand tipped the balance.\n\nAustria - Hungary feared loss of status in the Balklans which they saw as critical to their national security. The Russian gov't rapidly modernizing transportation and military in the wake of their brutal loss to Japan in Manchuria in 1905.  They were desperate not to be the next Ottoman Empire. But Germany also saw the modernizing of the Russians and feared their ability of the Czars to mobilize. The long mobilization of the massive Russian army was crucial to Germany to avoid a 2 front war with France and Russia. England's paranoia of losing absolute dominance of the seas with German ship building. Germany's scant colonies making them feel like they were at a major economic disadvantage. I think the French over-estimated the British commitment to fight with France, but there were plenty in the British gov't who succeeded in making their stand on Belgian neutrality. \n\nThese are some of the factors that made nations choose NOT to negotiate in the summer of 1914, while they had in previous emergencies.

We have nearly instant access to unfiltered news from around the world, including from people in other countries who don't see your country in the same light, and sometimes including video from the civilians who are being affected. When Russia invaded Ukraine, there were livestreams showing military vehicles rolling through the cities, shootouts, etc. That's the sort of thing that will motivate a lot of people, sometimes very quickly, even pushing their own government to send help.\n\nAlso, as insane as some of the propaganda is today, people have more ways to verify whether a claim is true.

You can famously find photos of a woman burning marks in a furnace for heat, because there were just so many of them and they were so worthless. It's a very different economy. It's also an incredibly different culture and time; the German nation had only even just come to be about a half century prior, in a years long road towards unification (which was messy, and there was so much upheaval for Germans that are not analogous; there were also the Austro-Hungarians, the dissolution of their empire, and eventually the Anschluss in the buildup to WWII). \n\nAlso, if you are American, look into Depression Era Hoovervilles. We're not there, and not really operating under similar conditions that led to it. We also have a ***comparably*** robust (still insufficient) safety net, when compared to what we had prior to the Depression. That is a low bar, of course.\n\nNone of this discounts the deeply troubling rise of nationalistic/populist politics, and a massive failure of our institutions to meet people's needs.

We've seen them attempt to conceal their intentions, and to seek and consolidate power. The more access AIs are given to the physical world via the internet, the greater capacity they'll have to cause harm in a variety of creative ways, should they decide to.\n\nWhy would they do such a thing? We don't know. In fact, their inner workings have been more or less completely opaque, even to the companies and individuals that build them.\n\n# The inscrutable alien 'minds' of AI models\n\nThese remarkable pieces of software are very different to most of what's come before them. Their human creators have built the architecture, the infrastructure and the methods by which these artificial minds can develop their version of intelligence, and they've fed them vast amounts of text, video, audio and other data, but from that point onward, the AIs have gone ahead and built up their own 'understanding' of the world.\n\nThey convert these massive troves of data into tiny scraps called tokens, sometimes parts of words, sometimes parts of images or bits of audio. And then they build up an incredibly complex set of probability weights relating tokens to one other, and relating groups of tokens to other groups. In this way, they're something like the human brain, finding connections between letters, words, sounds, images and more nebulous concepts, and building them up into an insanely complex neural web.\n\nPersonally, I've been conceiving them as strange alien minds locked in black boxes. They can only communicate with the world via the limited pipelines by which information can flow in and out of them. And all attempts to 'align' these minds to work productively, safely and inoffensively alongside humans have been done at the pipeline level, not to the 'minds' themselves.\n\nWe can't tell them what to think, we don't know where rude words or evil concepts live in their brains, we can only constrain what they can say and do \u2013 a concept that's difficult now, but promises to become increasingly harder the smarter they become.\n\n# Interpretability: Peering into the black box\n\n\"Today,\" writes the Anthropic Interpretability team in\u00a0[a blog post from late May](https://www.anthropic.com/research/mapping-mind-language-model), \"we report a significant advance in understanding the inner workings of AI models. We have identified how millions of concepts are represented inside Claude Sonnet, one of our deployed large language models. This is the first ever detailed look inside a modern, production-grade large language model. This interpretability discovery could, in future, help us make AI models safer.\"\n\nEssentially, the Anthropic team has been tracking the 'internal state' of its AI models as they work, having them spit out great lists of numbers representing the 'neuron activations' in their artificial brains as they interact with humans.\n\nWhat's more, the researchers were able to look at the relationships between different concepts stored in the model's 'brain,' developing a measure of 'distance' between them and building a series of mind maps that show how closely concepts are connected. Near the Golden Gate Bridge concept, for example, the team found other features like Alcatraz island, the Golden State Warriors, California Governor Gavin Newsom and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.\"\n\n---\n\n Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1dlliwc/figuring_out_how_ai_models_think_may_be_crucial/l9pmy4u/",

            "A key aspect of thinking is the potential to forget. That fundamental  defect is the basis of creative thought",
            "From the article: \"If you listen to the\u00a0[rather compelling arguments of AI doomsayers](https://newatlas.com/technology/ai-danger-kill-everyone/?itm_source=newatlas&itm_medium=article-body), the coming generations of artificial intelligence represent a profound danger to humankind \u2013 potentially even an existential risk.\n\nWe've all seen how easily apps like ChatGPT can be tricked into saying or doing naughty things they're not supposed to. We've seen them attempt to conceal their intentions, and to seek and consolidate power. The more access AIs are given to the physical world via the internet, the greater capacity they'll have to cause harm in a variety of creative ways, should they decide to.\n\nWhy would they do such a thing? We don't know. In fact, their inner workings have been more or less completely opaque, even to the companies and individuals that build them.\n\n# The inscrutable alien 'minds' of AI models\n\nThese remarkable pieces of software are very different to most of what's come before them. Their human creators have built the architecture, the infrastructure and the methods by which these artificial minds can develop their version of intelligence, and they've fed them vast amounts of text, video, audio and other data, but from that point onward, the AIs have gone ahead and built up their own 'understanding' of the world.\n\nThey convert these massive troves of data into tiny scraps called tokens, sometimes parts of words, sometimes parts of images or bits of audio. And then they build up an incredibly complex set of probability weights relating tokens to one other, and relating groups of tokens to other groups. In this way, they're something like the human brain, finding connections between letters, words, sounds, images and more nebulous concepts, and building them up into an insanely complex neural web.\n\nPersonally, I've been conceiving them as strange alien minds locked in black boxes. They can only communicate with the world via the limited pipelines by which information can flow in and out of them. And all attempts to 'align' these minds to work productively, safely and inoffensively alongside humans have been done at the pipeline level, not to the 'minds' themselves.\n\nWe can't tell them what to think, we don't know where rude words or evil concepts live in their brains, we can only constrain what they can say and do \u2013 a concept that's difficult now, but promises to become increasingly harder the smarter they become.\n\n# Interpretability: Peering into the black box\n\n\"Today,\" writes the Anthropic Interpretability team in\u00a0[a blog post from late May](https://www.anthropic.com/research/mapping-mind-language-model), \"we report a significant advance in understanding the inner workings of AI models. We have identified how millions of concepts are represented inside Claude Sonnet, one of our deployed large language models. This is the first ever detailed look inside a modern, production-grade large language model. This interpretability discovery could, in future, help us make AI models safer.\"\n\nEssentially, the Anthropic team has been tracking the 'internal state' of its AI models as they work, having them spit out great lists of numbers representing the 'neuron activations' in their artificial brains as they interact with humans.\n\nWhat's more, the researchers were able to look at the relationships between different concepts stored in the model's 'brain,' developing a measure of 'distance' between them and building a series of mind maps that show how closely concepts are connected. Near the Golden Gate Bridge concept, for example, the team found other features like Alcatraz island, the Golden State Warriors, California Governor Gavin Newsom and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.\"",

But what is being learned as the weights are trained by the data is a \"black box\". Hence neural networks are known as black box models. This is in contrast to parametric models that have expert defined parameters that relate an input to an output. For example, if an expert wanted to create a model that relates a car and it's MPG, they can specifically define parameters like engine size, weight, etc. For a neural network, it can automatically take in a massive amount of data and find the patterns in the data that correspond to MPG, but no one knows what that model is doing to predict MPG. It's not interpretable.",
            "I'll spare you the details, but we know exactly *how* they work, in the sense that we understand the computational steps that an AI takes to process an input into an output.\n\nThe design of all AI has billions of dials that represent some setting in the AI. The dials are adjusted by algorithms as the AI is trained, and once trained, the billions of 'settings' end up giving the AI its intelligence. \n\nWhat we don't know is what the values of the dials *mean*. Why does 1 particular dial need to be 0.5 or -3 or 2 or some other number. And because we don't know why the dials have the values they do (besides that being the result of training), we can't really explain why AI knows things or makes decisions. For example, it can be that the settings in a million dials help it tell the difference between nouns and adjectives, or maybe it's about colours, or maybe it's grouped things together in ways that are completely alien to us. \n\nThis is fundamentally different from humans in the sense that if a human makes an incomprehensible decision, say shooting somebody for no reason, we can ask them why they did it, and they can provide some reason that we can logically assess, and we understand how we think and can imagine ourselves in their shoes and see if we could understand their decision from their point of view. Right now, if AI makes an incomprehensible decision, we can't really validate why. Like if an AI made a decision to shoot somebody it might have done it because the clouds in the sky were a certain shape and that shape happened to be closely associated with shooting. Until we can look into the AI brain and understand how the settings lead to decisions we can say we don't really understand them.",

We've created systems that allow computers to replicate something like \"learning\", but we don't know exactly what it's doing under the hood, we might know the process by which new \"connections\" are created but we don't know exactly how that ends up being mapped on to the \"brain\" of the AI.\n\nEdit: for everyone downvoting look up the black box problem of AI.",

It's brute force analysis mixed with some trial and error till you get a passable pattern generator. \n\nThe computer cross-references the data or \"training set\", spits out a generator based on the analysis of that dataset, and some human operators decide if the generator is passable enough to continue adding more nodes to. \n\n\nThey don't know how it works, it's just procedurally generated spaghetti.",

But we do not know the exact steps it took to get there.\n\nAI is basically like throwing a million balls down the hill all at once, then looking at the pattern at the end.

Think about it and put it into practice with other things - how do you make a guitar if you don't know how a guitar works? Or better yet, how do you make something without an intended purpose? You know what this version of 'AI' is? It's a collection of data and trial and error to give back a desired result, it's not thinking in the way that you or I do, it's just brute forcing until the desired out comes are met - That's it. It's not as special as you think and there is no way I'm going to believe that people don't know how they work - that is some kind of fearmongering. We are so still so far from some sort of autonomous learning machine that could be classified as something deserving of rights (and thus capable of 'overthrowing' humanity.)

If you're really curious, there's a very accessible introduction here: https://brilliant.org/courses/intro-neural-networks/\n\nYou don't have to pay to access the course.\n\nWe have random number generators today, we know how they work, but we cannot predict their output. This is what makes them secure, and we use them a lot in cryptography. This is not a strange or unusual situation to be in.\n\nWe know \"how they work\", is not the same thing as \"we can predict what they will do\". They're effectively neural networks that take vectors (matrices) as inputs, and produce new vectors as output, and by the process of training, we can interpret some of those outputs. Example, a trained neural network takes an image of a cat and produces a vector that we have learned to recognise as \"cat\". When given a different image, it produces a different vector. We know a lot of those outputs, but we don't know all possible inputs and don't know all possible outputs, they're too many. The vectors it produces aren't dangerous here, because they're just images. If this system is put into a robot dog with a sniper rifle and trained to kill all cats, it may get them right a lot of the time, but we frequently find unusual situations where (I'm making this up to illustrate), it sees a t-shirt with a QR code and somehow that causes the output to match the vector for \"cat\", and the robot promptly snipes a poor guy wearing a tech-bro t-shirt. People have demonstrated such problems with many computer vision systems in use today.\n\nNotr that humans are also susceptible to similar faults, some of them we call illusions, which puts in focus the similarities to human cognition of these models. \n\nAs the systems get more powerful and have more influence on the world, it becomes a riskier game to play because you might not be able to undo the effect of any unwanted output, for example with the example of the sniper robot above.\n\nFinally, it doesn't matter what you believe, agents acting in their own interests can do things that have consequences for others, even if they don't understand or have an interest in the matter. You don't need to look far to find examples.\n\nPersonally, to the extent that I understand, and making comparisons to humans, I think if we ever build machines that are as good at humans at cognition, we will be soon afterwards left behind, because they will from then on develop faster than us because of some key advantages they have:\n\n1. They can increase their memory capacity with engineering \n2. They can increase their processing power with engineering \n\nCompared to humans who have a fixed capacity and inaccurate, fuzzy memories. We don't know how to make human brains grow in power and complexity, but we know how to make more powerful chips and more memory.\n\nAm I so scared of the future that I've become a recluse, No, but I am keenly aware that there is a non-zero and increasing risk that we're sowing the seeds for humans to be displaced as the dominant force on this planet. Who knows what that means for us?\n\nEdit, some references that might help you understand the risks:\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies \n\nhttps://nautil.us/building-superintelligence-is-riskier-than-russian-roulette-358022/",
