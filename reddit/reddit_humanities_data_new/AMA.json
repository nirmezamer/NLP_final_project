            "I was 11 or 12 and the girl was 14- and the thing I think now, as an adult, is that she must have been being sexually abused by someone older than her.  We even had anal sex, which she was familiar with .  I didn\u2019t have a clue about anything.  I don\u2019t think kids want to just go all in like that without some kind of abuse happening in their lives.  So it\u2019s a lot to unpack.  I don\u2019t necessarily \u201cfeel\u201d like I was a \u201cvictim\u201d.  When I think of it, which is rarely, I almost think she must have been the victim of someone else, and was trying to shift the power , or something.  It doesn\u2019t excuse sexual abusers, but I have a kind of strange compassion for her in that sense.  It\u2019s kind of wild to think about.  I\u2019ll bet a lot of kids need help that they feel that they can\u2019t ask for.  It\u2019s a sickening idea.  I think the way to get your angel wings is to have abuse/bad behaviors/ etc stop with you.   Hurt people hurt people, they say.  But I believe they can also help people- if they learn from their own experiences, and then live accordingly .   \u201cHelping people \u201c can simply mean NOT continuing cycles of dysfunction and/or abuse.",

The one time I had it figured out and was ready her sister caught us. \n\nThis went on until she went on to high school and got a boyfriend. I was devastated because I thought I was her boyfriend.\n\nThis left me a hypersexual adult and prone to unhealthy relationships with women into my 40s. I didn\u2019t lose my virginity until 21 because I was so obsessed with purity as a result of my experience, that it had to be with another virgin. Really I wanted to save it for marriage but didn\u2019t end up doing that. \n\nI\u2019ve finally come to terms with all of it and accepted it as the past.

Apparently some people drink a gallon of milk a day as a bulking strategy while lifting. It's got a shit ton of protein, fat, and calories. I know some users were talking about sugar but milk has way better macros than candy or ice cream. However at 2400 calories in a gallon, it alone meets the daily calorie need for most people! I wanna try to stay in the spirit of the ama but can't help but join the crowd questioning the health implications. Let me at least say this: watch out for your 30s when your metabolism slows down or if you ever work a less active job!\n\nOkay for the actual AMA... Do you have a favorite brand? Ever tried Raw milk? Thoughts on organic vs pastured raised vs other random buzz words on the packaging, do you find any of it reliably leads you to a good glass? Ever drink it warm or on ice?",

I'm 38 now and still actively dieting trying to lose it. I don't drink a gallon a day anymore but I do indulge every now and again. Milk is my addiction but it also gave me diabetes and has killed my body pretty bad. Just consider cutting back.",
            "Okay. But my point is that you have a family history of diabetes and you're consuming almost double the recommended sugar intake *every single day*. Not just sometimes but all the time. \n\nIt's absolutely crazy. As far as it's nutritional value? It's fortified with essential vitamins and contains other necessity minerals (sodium, calcium, potassium). It's high in protein and has some fat (assuming non fat free). As something to consume, it's decently healthy minus the large amount of sugar. Though it's lactose which is galactose and dextrose. So the glycemic index is lower than something with sucrose or glucose.",
            "Reminds me of my dad pretty much lol.  He has always been big, but never really obese.  He has ran his landscaping business and stayed pretty active, he played sports all growing up and even a bit in college.  Drinking a gallon of milk a day is kinda crazy but he was also primarily eating fast food, drinking huge gas station slushees, like the worst food imaginable.  A few years ago he kept telling us his toes and fingers were tingly and he went on like that until he went to the hospital and his blood sugar was over 400.  I really think it was soda, slushees, ice cream that did it to him faster then the milk but the milk probably did a bit lol.",

Do you guys talk about being intimate - like she has a goal of wanting to be or she outwardly says she wants things to stay the same always? Maybe she's asexual? \n\nMy only advice would be to talk very openly about your wants & needs, and vice-versa and try to start very slowly with more intimate encounters - if she's open to that. \n\nGood luck and congrats again on finding the love of your life!",
