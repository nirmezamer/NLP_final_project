            "Does anyone remember The Boys: Diabolical in the episode where the husband gives his wife dying of pancreatic cancer V and it gives her cancer tentacle powers.\n\nIs it possible the V Butcher took just gave power to the tumor in his brain and when it was threatened with death it lashed out and killed the aggressor.",
            "At 16, his name was The Homelander. \n\nAnd then Sean Parker told him to drop the \u2018The\u2019 \n\n\u201cJust Homelander. it\u2019s cleaner\u201d",
            "Homelander was terrifying. I dont know why anyone would keep working for Vought. Seems just like a matter of time before Homelander snaps on your department.",
            "I just realized I was scared of Homelander showing up in all the A-Train scenes... even though there was no chance of that happening because of Homelander's plot this episode... maybe the most terrifying character I've ever seen.",

            "A big round of applause to Nancy Lenehan\u2019s performance as Barbara holy shit\n\nTestament to the amazing acting, direction, and writing on display: no need to film a live flashback to Homelander\u2019s birth; just her description and casual demeanor while recounting it was somehow more vivid and terrifying than I could imagine.",
            "Damn...\n\nSo Hughie's mom found the V and gave it to him.\n\nMost curious part is what happened to Ezekiel in that trailer??? I'm assuming that maybe Butcher still has powers, but needs a ton of strength + effort to use them, hence Ezekiel blowing up when he's almost near death.",
            "glad they made it so the pregnancy/abortion was discussed by Annie & Hughie. For a split second I thought they were going to force drama between them and make it so Annie never told him bout their baby.",

            "Alright. I hate the motherfucker. He's evil.\u00a0\n\n\nBut as an adult raised on daily beatings the \"You're sorry? Now?\" line shredded me. That's *exactly* the tone and eyes I had when I finally saw my abusive parents again.",

            "Two things can be true.\n\n- This might have easily been a top 5 episode in the series. Explored and brought out the worst of our characters in so many ways. Will never understand Hughie haters, he's been my favorite character since s1\n\n- God I don't want to watch that again.",

            "Was the lobotomy sex scene the the one they were talking about filming the most disgusting thing yet?\n\n\n\n\nBecause Im actually a little nauseous from that one, Jesus fucking christ.",
            "Should have killed the feed before you beat the shit out of her",
            "This is probably the best episode yet so far. Lots of reveals from almost every character, and We get to see more compound V. \n\nbutcher taking v was no surprise, It had to be done if the show was to run 5 seasons\n\nHomelander doig the victim getting revenge on the bully trope, reminds me of Ricardo Diaz burning his childhood bully from The CW arrow series\n\nsadly no joe kessler today\n\nWas great seeing fire\"cracker\" getting wrecked\n\n  \nI NEED to see what happened to ezekiel, annie is gonna be framed for it though.",

            "Jesus Christ Homelander is terrifying",
            "Well that just cemented Homelander as one of the greatest villains of all time. Chilling, calm and fucking diabolical.",
            "Every scene with Homelander and where he was raised is some of the most tense TV i've ever seen. Whats interesting to me as a comic reader is that much of Homelanders back story is new for the show. In the comic he was also abused in a Lab but it doesn't really go into it. It is also interesting to see his identity change, we see his name go from \"john\" to \"homelander\", when he gets to around 16.\n\nSPOILERS FOR THE COMIC: >!In the comic he was also abused in a Lab but it doesn't really go into it. It is mentioned he wasn't even held before he was like 7, They strapped him to a hydrogen bomb and kept him sedated because you can't reason with a baby/toddler, also he wasn't the only one to go through it, they mention all of the original 7 had the same happen!<",
            "A TRAIN AND ASHLEY LETS GOOOO they will redeem themselves together\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",
            "Also, Kimiko-Hughie is always a cute dynamic and I loved seeing them together",
            "Antony Starr is so goddamn terrifying. Those scenes with Frank and Marty and the way he reverts into this unhinge little boy, like a kid excited to play with his toys\u2026.my god, it creeped me the fuck out",
            "Man fuck Hughies mom. She is out of his life, comes back in out of no where, usurps power of attorney from him behind his back, is basically ready to pull the plug on his dad until she sees an opportunity to slither in and put the V in his dad's veins, again choosing whether or not to let his dad live. She's a conniving and underhanded manipulator, even if they try to spin it that she's trying to mend things.",
            "that marty jerking it scene was insane, especially the sound effects lord have mercy",
            "Is Butcher\u2019s power kinda like Venom\u2019s where it takes over whenever he\u2019s in danger? That\u2019s cool af",
            "Did..did firecracker somehow justify being a pedophile?",
            "i saw a guy burning alive\n\nanother one getting his dick lasered out and then his head squished\n\nand yet, i had to fast foward the fucking lobotomy scene.",
            "The random cut of Firecracker introducing Kanye West was the funniest part of the episode \n\nThat and \u201cmy pussyyyyy\u201d",
            "Every single time The Deep shows up on screen, I immediately start laughing hysterically. Chase Crawford continues to play him so perfectly that I can't get enough of him.",
            "So is Butcher now The Boy\u2019s version of Venom? Cause I\u2019m getting some strong vibes that Billy\u2019s mass produced tendrils, plus the hallucinations and the blacking out. \n\nDidn\u2019t have Butcher Venom on my Bingo Card.",
            "So  I haven\u00b4t seen anyne pick up on this, but the Image, that Barbara describes about Homelanders (Killed at birth with the umbilical cord still hanging of him) birth is a reference to the Comic Panel of Homelanders Baby, that Becca has and the one that Billy has to kill early on, right?",
            "The comedic timing in the lobotomy scene was the best. \u201cUuhhh\u2026that\u2019s just fucking gross!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll let you fuck me in the ass while we the watch the Kim and Ray J video.\u201d \u201cOk, so where you want me to put it, just right there?\u201d Lmao",
            "that was probably the darkest episode of the series for the members of The Boys. I think they\u2019re fucked tbh, like\u2026 Homelander won. \n\nIdk how they turn back",
            "God damn I guessed it was a lobotomy tool in episode 3 but I DID NOT need to see it happen lmao.\n\nAlso fuck me this episode REALLY made things with Hughie\u2019s family SPICY. I fucking love that direction. But if Butcher can\u2019t be cured with regular V what the fuck happens to Hughie\u2019s dad considering he was in a vegetative state?\n\nButcher has actual powers now that\u2019s neat.",
            "Every time the episode cut back to any time in the laboratory my stomach would just drop and I would feel sick. What a crazy episode.",
            "This is definitely the most \"Our heroes at their lowest point\" episode of the series so far. Coupled with Homelander going completely unhinged and Firecracker ascending you can see the writers setting everything up for the endgame.\n\nHughie's parents and the (most likely) Super Cancer monster Butcher has inside him are the wildcards and I'm interested to see where those storylines go.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Everytime Homelander is on screen, I get anxiety mixed with fear for real because I have no fuckin idea what he'll do or kill next. Kudos to Antony for playing the character to such perfection. Jesus",
            "Homelander is a sadist. However after this episode I definitely get how he would turn into a depraved psychopath under such conditions.",
            "Never thought I would empathise with Homelander but here we are. Those people were so fucking evil, abusing and torturing a kid just so the company could grow. No wonder he grew up to a such a sadistic sociopath. Antony Starr nailed this episode like Deep nailed Sage.  \n\n\nOn the other hand, the Colin - Frenchie plotline seems a bit... messy. The pacing feels super weird to me and I don't really know where it's going.  \n\n\nThe Sister Sage and Deep scene with the lobotomy was hilarious to me. Deep going from grossed out to full horny was incredible hahaha",
            "Well, that was basically \u201call of the characters make the worst possible decisions they can\u201d- the episode.",
            "Man, this episode is *fucked*. I don't think any other episode has this much dread.. this is such a low point for everyone involved.\n\nThis is probably my favorite episode out of the whole series. It was emotional and it was *disgusting*.",
            "This was maybe the first time I felt that Homelander was justified in killing someone.  They tortured him as a child and his anger was understandable.",
            "I don't feel sorry for the scientists Homelander killed. \n\nThey were awful human beings who created more awful supe. \n\n\"Just following orders\", that line is straight up from Nuremberg Trials.",
            "[deleted]",
            "I clocked the weird worm swimming around in Butcher's temple in episode 2 or 3, wasn't sure if it was just a visual representation of the cancer, but now it seems like there's a Compound V borne parasite living in his head, keeping him alive so it can get stronger, talking to him as a vision of Becca. And if knows everything Butcher knows, it knows about the supe killing virus Neumann snagged from Godolkin",
            "This episode is one of the first that made me uncomfortable in a long time",
            "God. Homelander was the star of this episode. So unhinged. Straight up Joker laugh during THAT scene",
            "When they threatened to blackmail Firecracker with the pedo scandal my first thought was \u201chalf of these alt-right grifters already have scandals like that and no one cares\u201d. I\u2019m glad the show got that part right.",
            "I can't believe they are still finding new ways to make me more horrified by Homelander. I thought I would be desensitized to it by now but I guess not",
            "Certified supe, certified pedophile",
            "That Lobotomy was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to watch on this show",
            "Before reading other comments and getting my hype down, I wanna say this was for me one of the best episodes from all the seasons, and if not, pretty much in my top of favorites.\n\n\n\u00a0It has everything: Becca's hallucinations interacting more with Butcher; Homelander having his petty revenge not only in a \"kill you\" way but also with a psychological element into it, Annie finally reaching her breaking point and getting backlash for it (so excited to see how will act as we got mention of a new suit), Kimiko reveal about her participation on the abduction, and also I love that the deal with Collin and Frenchie's ankle wasn't dragged out but having an impact in the same episode. Oh and also the classic The Boys blackmailing but with a twist.\n\n\nBonus point to Sage getting amused by watching Firecracker getting beat up and also Hughie finally forgiving A-Train; feels like the last step for his redeeming arc before a bigger event (his exchange with Ashley was peak moment). Can't wait to see what's with Hughie's mom for that last scene; she knows more about V compound and supes that her \"common civilian\" appearance let know.\u00a0\n\n\nEdit: some typos",
            "Every single scene with homelander is stunning to watch.",
            "\"Eww, I'm not gonna lobotomize you. That's disgusting!\"\n\n\"I'll let you do it in my butt...\"\n\n\"At your service my queen\"\n\nSums up The Deep and Sage conversation",
            "If Antony Starr never wins an Emmy, it'll be the biggest entertainment disgrace since Jason Alexander never won an Emmy for George Costanza.  \n\nKripke was not being hyperbolic when he talked up his performance in this episode.",
            "Why do I have the sneaking suspicion that Hughie's mom is a supe?",
            "tek knight: \"... into a dark, gaping hole.\"",
            "I didn't understand why Colin and Kiara were looking at Annie with such judgemental looks.    \n\n\nFirecracker herself said Annie was only 13 and that it was an accident when she stopped the robbery. \n\n\nWhy would her friends judge her for that?",
            "I love how firecracker told Butcher to speak American\ud83d\ude2d lmao",
            "The elevator ding at the end was so eerie. Toni Starr needs an Emmy ASAP",
            "Just realized we have 4 more episodes until we have to wait for S5\u2026",
            "I had a feeling how Homie would kill the male scientists, but not the woman at the end. Leaving her in the Bad Room with the brutalized corpses and melting the door closed? Diabolical",
            "Sage is such an interesting character and I really like the portrayal of her intelligence. They've absolutely nailed the sense of smart people being underestimated by people around them and the skill of seemingly getting everybody on side without those people recognising they are being manipulated. Proper chess pieces vs chess master dynamics. It's really fun to watch",
            "I see. Sage is actually a little envious of Deep for being stupid.",
            "I was so amazed by how absolutely terrifying Homelander was simply by carrying a cake into a room.",
            "I don\u2019t know why, but my instinct was that Hughie didn\u2019t know about Annie\u2019s abortion. I was so relieved when he told her it was between the two of them. It says a heck of a lot that the depiction of healthy communication in a relationship was the thing that surprised me most in this ep!",
            "Honestly, that is easily the best episode of the season so far. Homelander, taking his trauma out on the doctors was just unsettling.\n\nI knew in the end he was gonna kill them all, but the anticipation of it was just crazy",
            "Hughie\u2019s mom is the sussiest fuck I\u2019ve ever seen. I don\u2019t trust her one bit.\u00a0",

            "The Gecko situation is I agree pretty much wholly fucked. \n\nThe carjacking tho contains more. Annie while not intending to did kill a guy, she definently commited manslaughter. However the only reason the situation developed as it did was cause of Butcher. He brandished a weapon, escalated and deliberately agitated both Annie and the driver. Annie is responsible for his death but the only reason that occurred is cause Butcher is a callous ass.",
            "That's the whole point of The Boys: to bring accountability to the supes. Most of them have no training, there seems to be almost no protocol to rescue civilians / hostages (if there is, they don't follow since there will be a clean up crew and PR team to sweep it under the rug), ...",

These posts with some kinda \u201cgotcha!\u201d as a way to tear down a character aren\u2019t particularly insightful. \n\nAnnie is presented as someone trying to navigate the situations she finds herself as best she can.  She\u2019s made mistakes, and her hands aren\u2019t clean.  No one\u2019s hands on this show are clean - it\u2019s a f***ed up, sick world they inhabit.

Because the argument is not whether or not Annie has done bad things, Firecracker is a literal manifestation of a bad thing she did in the past and is paying for now.  In case you haven't noticed it's kind of the overarching theme of season 4.  Frenchie falling for a man whose family he slaughtered, Huey's mom coming back to the family she abandoned, Huey after not having been there for his dad in recent seasons now not being trusted to make decisisons about his health, Kimiko running into a girl she helped abduct, just to name a few.",

            "Annie has definitely played dirty to achieve the aims of the Boys, but still her actions were aimed at taking down the Evil Empire of Homelander and Vought. I mean Hughie and Butcher conspired with Soldier Boy to help find and murder his former team, making them murderers too (And let's not forget Hughie murdering Translucent). All of that said, Hughie is probably the purest soul of the main characters on the show. He's definitely the conscience of the Boys.\n\nBack to Annie: Annie would not be a fun character if she stayed clean. It is the fact that despite her wholesome background that she has stepped in the shit to get things done that makes her really good for the show and fit in with the Boys.\n\nThink about Cassian Andor's actions in Rogue One when he murdered the crippled informant to conceal what he'd revealed to him. The \"Ends Justify the Means\" is a slippery slope but it almost always happens in war (or quasi-war), even by the \"good guys.\"",

            "Nah with Annie she's been dragged down to the levels of the world she's in. \n\nShe's CAPABLE of being like The Boys but at her core I don't think she is. Just as ever with a war, which this kinda is, you will get desensitized at some point. Like even Episode 1 Annie is not the same Annie blackmailing people and calling out Maeve like she did.",
            "Man, I'm honestly so tired of seeing this shit and how twisted these events are retold when the truth is far from being that.\n\n\nBlackmailing Gecko: Yes, it's a shitty thing, but for the greater good, I definitely can't say it's **that** bad, especially compared to a lot of things others do in this universe. You know, the people she's trying to take down? Getting a sample of V out there was supposed to stop Vought or at least fuck it a lot, which was supposed to be a good thing. The reasons she does it is from a good place and the whole point of the show is they do fucked up things for the good reasons (most of the boys at least).\n\n\n\nKilling the innocent man: Not her fault, 100% will stand by that and die on that hill. She tries to de-escalate the situation and Butcher is the real asshole here. The guy is acting in self-defense and doesn't want to get robbed, but she also literally saved Butcher from getting shot. We can hear the gunshot **before**(literally milliseconds) she uses her powers, basically at the same time. Go watch it again, Youtube \"Starlight kills man\" and freeze at the exact time she uses her powers vs the time we hear the bullet fired. She also didn't mean to kill him judging by her reaction and while it would have been nice to get more than just her initial reaction, she was clearly messed up about it. This sub trying to say she \"murdered\" an innocent father should be paying attention and start using real terms like \"accidental manslaughter\", because this is what it was. If her intentions would have been to kill him, then that would be different, but it's not.",
            "If they were trying to make her a character who has to start letting down moral barriers as time goes on, that's fine. But what annoys me is they keep forgetting this and portraying her as if she's the only one on the high horse. The show-writers kept hinting that Starlight is going to end up deciding that Supes have to end now and then gets mad whenever moral compromises are made to get to that goal.",

Year old.\n\nSeason 4 will show  if i'm right. \n\n\nAnd i like to say maeve. Yes she treated many people horrible but she is truly good at heart. She doesn't pretend to have the moral highgorund.\n\n\nShe was ready to give her life to stop homelander on the spot.\n\n\nShe has many problems. But if you say that the plane and the sharp shooter both died because she was too scared of homelander then i think you could make a case here. \n\n\nMaeve imo is the only one that actually is a hero.

People who are trying to seriously criticize starlight in lieu of literally anyone else is baffling. She IS a great person. Perhaps the best on the show. She's human but she consistently knows right from wrong, is motivated by good things and strives to care for those around her. She hates hurting people and loves inspiring others.

Annie was off to the side and a gun was aimed directly at Butcher and Hughie. Butcher was escalating the situation and the guy was amping up to shoot. Annie did a starlight blast at him to stop him but it ended up killing him. \n\nShe did not mean to kill him as she went to check his pulse. She was only trying to stop him from shooting at Butcher. Keep in mind, she has done these blasts before to humans (in s1 episode 2 where she saved a random girl from getting raped) without killing them. But the blast led to a fatal blunt force trauma.

She basically just defended her dying boyfriend and didn't pull her punch enough - it's not good, but she is the only character in that scene who was trying the hardest they could to deescalate the situation when Butcher and the driver were ramping it up to an inevitably violent conclusion.",

Butcher then emerges with Hughie, where the man steps out of the car and Butcher says he's FBI and he needs to commandeer the vehicle. The man asks for ID but Butcher says he doesn't have it. The man offers to drive them to the hospital since he doesn't want to be stuck in the middle of nowhere. Butcher says, \"Have it your way,\" and walks over to put Hughie down. Annie goes over to Butcher and tells him, \"Don't.\" As Butcher is kneeling, the man can see the gun in his back pocket and he then freaks out and pulls out the gun. Annie says that it is not necessary and they should just talk. Butcher is closing in further and further when he says, \"I'm gonna take your keys.\" Annie tells Butcher to stop and tells the man to drop the gun. At this point, Butcher is right there and the man is looking to pull the trigger. He doesn't put the gun down and then Annie does as I said. \n\nAs far as I can tell, after he refused the car, it was Butcher who escalated the situation every step of the way. She wasn't pushing to take his car after he said that. Butcher immediately took it upon himself to walk a bit back and put Hughie down. Butcher was the one who decided to get in the man's face. What Annie did was bad and she could have handled it so much better obviously, but it was a situation that spiraled out of control quickly largely because of Butcher. She was protecting Butcher and did not mean to kill the man. It was an accident.",

He didn't even **try** to get his friend to see his point of view. He prefered to resort to the same crap he always do: manipulating him so he could get him out of the way. The guy ensured he destroyed all trust the team had in him. Still you blame Starlight and MM for not buying into his Herogasm and Tower plans, both of which would've also led to a shitload of casualties that Butcher clearly doesn't care about. I love the guy like the next guy, but bro is selfish to a destructive level.

There is nothing to suggest the vaught soldiers were following those three or would have any reason to go in that specific direction to that spot, and also wr don't see any escapees going in that direction. Even then the soldiers aren't going to kill a random guy who saw nothing, at worse they'll pay him off like they do most civilians,\u00a0 and the patients have only been shown to act hostile towards staff at saint Grove (the guy injured Hughie looked like he didn't mean to).

            "The scary part is she may be much smarter than homelander, but he\u2019s not as stupid as he seems. His psychological torture as a young man did involve also a lot of training and education in many different topics. At least in raw intelligence he\u2019s far from dumb, and he\u2019s reasonably well read for somebody who has no hobbies and interests outside of his own ego. That torture also involved manipulating him into craving attention and love, but it ended up turning him into a monster who is extremely manipulative and cunning in his own right. \n\nHer lobotomy idea is a recipe for disaster especially when loudmouth sycophant the deep is around her for those moments. When she is impaired she may let something slip, especially if her and deep end up romantically involved. Not to mention she is extremely cocky and overconfident, and as A-Train put it \u201cdoesn\u2019t know when to stop talking.\u201d\n\nShe is to intelligence what homelander is to strength and physical power. Homelander is used to being the strongest in the world, and believes he\u2019s so far ahead of everybody else that no one can challenge him. She\u2019s the smartest person in the world and is directly cocky and condescending to homelander\u2019s face, because she believes she\u2019s so many levels above him and everyone else that he\u2019s easily manipulated. \n\nAlso important to mention that he can sense peoples emotional state and internal tension like blood pressure and heart rate changes, sweating and breathing patterns to tell if somebody is lying or not a lot of the time, or if they\u2019re scared. We\u2019ve seen starlight kind of fool this before, but that was a unique situation. Sage is likely able to remain calm under pressure but in a lobotomised state I don\u2019t trust her ability to lie convincingly to homelander without giving it away, maybe in her regular state she might slip up too. \n\nThe \u201cdoesn\u2019t know when to stop talking\u201d line felt like foreshadowing to me. Same with her saying \u201cI am almost never surprised\u201d when homelander shows up to her apartment in plain clothes. He\u2019s already shocked her once by being unpredictable, and she talks about people having patterns that are easy to read I believe. Homelander of the past is not homelander of today, and with his spiralling mental illness he\u2019s only going to be more unpredictable and volatile. \n\nHe could kill her for something as petty as wanting to be the smartest person in the world, because he probably thinks in his delusional mind that he\u2019s at worst #2 behind her. \n\nSmartest? Sure. But still capable of making mistakes. One small slip and it\u2019s over.",

Humanity would not survive a massive asteroid impact, deep sea worms that live around hydrothermal vents would. We carry around more bacteria in our bodies than our own cells, wherever we go, they follow. You could make the arguments all of those species are therefore superior to humans. Populations of organisms simply adapt to survive, we can't really say one species is more evolved or superior than another. Here's an interesting article from The Harvard Gazette: [https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/04/not-as-evolved-as-we-think/](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/04/not-as-evolved-as-we-think/)\n\nMind you, Supes' superiority has nothing to do with evolution anyway. They didn't evolve their abilities, they were just given a drug developed by engineers. Since getting rid of the Compound V in their bodies also destroys their powers, they're basically humans on super steroids technically. (Ryan might be the exception to that since he was born with powers and may have different DNA to other supes/humans.)",
