            "Capcom really said 'it's Tuesday so let's drop MvC collection and Bison's character guide'",
            "Interesting to see that they made OD headstomp throw invincible. I wonder if they'd do that for other OD attacks that put you in the air (I'm looking at you, OD buttslam).",
            "He seems pretty solid against projectiles? Wonder who will be strong against him.",
            "I'm curious to see if his lvl 3 and CA have some travel distance or only hits from close up.\n\nAlso I wonder if overdrive crusher will go through Rashid's lvl 2. Seems like psycho punisher will be a counter to that",
            "I noticed that, like guile moveset, your world avatar might probably be able to use bison\u2019s entire moveset since I believe each of his four specials have a unique directional input from each other. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but I think he has one qcf motion, one qcb motion, one (b)f motion, and lastly one (d)u motion.",
            "And here I thought there was no way they\u2019d be able to top how badass Akuma is. Capcom is the absolute Goat at character design.",
            "I was a Bison player in the SF4 days and tbh it might be time to go back to tha old me",
            "We don't know yet about Dictator's story mode, but I'm pretty sure he wants to get his old power and prestige back (we always saw him as the ruler of Shadaloo, so it's the first time he's in a more \"underdog\" role).\n\nAnd that REALLY aligns with his more \"aggressive\" gameplay in SF 6. I personally REALLY enjoy that \"storyline - gameplay integration\".\n\nFor the same reason, I think that having the manipulative JP as a zoner fits his personality like a glove.",
            "He's gonna be scary when he comes out, but I don't think he'll be the next Akuma or Rashid.  All of his non-EX specials seem punishable on block?  And no EX DP of course.  But he does have great walkspeed and what look like some great normals too, including a cancelable low forward.",
            ">Shadow Rise and it's follow-ups\n\nI realize this is an incredibly minor spelling mistake but it caught me off guard because these videos usually have pretty good production value",
            "I just love his cloak physics!",
            "For Bison mains, it's one of the most important days in their lives. But for him, it was Tuesday.",
            "At the end, Bison blocked Juri's forward HP (-4 on block) and responded with a level 3. Does this suggest his level 3 is a 4 framer? That seems unusually fast.",
            "Rad",
            "Why is there a duck saying \"cuack cuack\" at the end of OD Psycho Crusher?",
            "When does he drop?",
            "Is his drive rush as crazy as it looks!?",
            "He looks really good, but I think it was Max's preview that showed he really seemed to struggle against projectiles. That could be a hard limit on him as Ken, Guile, and Luke seem to still be dominant in the S2 meta so far. Deejay, Akuma, and Ryu are also of concern with their multi-hit projectiles.",
            "Those psycho mines look like a problem.",
            "His specials being unsafe is a bummer but eh gonna require to do more poking the get around those limitations.",
            "[deleted]",
            "So what are our impressions gang? Does he seem balanced? Overpowered? Too early to tell?",
            "he still lacks of antiair but he regained the speed lost in sfv and now has spammable psycho crusher that can be used even safe with OD... ranked would be a mess during first days",
            "I Think SFV bison is better than this one, kinda gives me that vibe.",
            "In Max\u2019s bison preview last week it looked like regular psycho crusher lost to fireballs, now at least beats single hits",
            "*It's Chewsday Innit!?*",
            "Honda having a choice between a throw invincible reversal or a armored one would be interesting",
            "It looks like his L1 might not be invincible to throws (they only mention strikes in the video) so they probably made OD Shadow Rise invincible to throws to give him an additional option to beat throw loops other than backdash or drive reversal",
            "Why would Honda need that? It's supposed to be to stop throw loops. Honda has armor",
            "Why would they?  Honda doesn't sell DLC.  Only DLC characters get privileges.",
            "I know Bison has history struggled against zoners. His new crusher property may make up for that but we\u2019ll have to see how callout-heavy it will be.",
            "At first sight I'd say Blanka would be ok vs him (great A.Air control and no fireball, doll setups and air ball to control space)    \nAnd on the other hand, Bison really seems to have a great kit vs Akuma, his Psycho Crusher seems ideal vs Akuma's air options (fireball, overhead and dive kick).  \nLet's see once he is fully released, but that's my initial thoughts",
            "Jamies projectile invuln move does so probably",
            "I really hope so!\u00a0",
            "It'll all depend on how easily he can set up his mines",
            "His non-EX are not plus, doesn't mean they're all punishable. He has multiple safe options on block but he probably needs to space most of them correctly, and for those that are unsafe their value change after he's used the mine. The Psycho mine seems like it's going to be pretty central to his pressure. \n\nHe's probably going to be a drive meter killer, and I'm sure there's going to be some nasty setups with \"I'm going to take 3 bars of drive gauge off of you if you block, and if you parry I get punish counter throw and psycho mine combo\".\n\nHis psycho mine to block pressure seems to be what AKI's poison is to combo conversion.",
            "From the preview videos by Rooflemonger his hk.Scissors is safe on block and maybe mk.Scissors as well, we have no idea how Bomb/Backfist will be on block, Devil's Reverse and Skull Diver are plus on block without meter.",
            "It is follow-ups",
            "In the future the word \"its\" won't exist anymore.  It's time may well have passed already.",
            "Interesting. I am sure I was taught at school to use \"it's\" for possessives too, in the same way you would for names, ie. this is Jane's car. Seems that's actually wrong. I've learned something new",
            "It didn't say punish counter, so I think it's more to show that it has invulnerability.\u00a0",
            "Now I can\u2019t unhear the Donald (duck)",
            "June 26",
            "Yesterday",
            "Max also said that psycho crusher doesnt go through projectiles and that he has slow walkspeed, both of those things being wrong. \n\nHe might still struggle against projectiles even if crusher goes through. From what we've seen id be surprised if he was top tier. Seems depended on OD scissor kick for combos, so drive hungry. No reversal. His damage also seemed kinda low. Might be his strong normals and good pressure save him. He looks fun though, will def try him.",
            "Between 1-hit projectile invuln psycho crusher, fully projectile invuln OD crusher, and lvl2 super, it seems he should do fine against fireballs on paper.\u00a0\n\n\nTraditionally, he's struggled against fireballs, but back then crusher wasn't projectile invulnerable. Also, lvl2 is a super now, not an ultra (charged by taking damage), and has a motion input instead of charge.\n\n\nWe'll see soon, I look forward to playing him!",
            "Bro pulled out the government name",
            "Always the latter duh. How could he be either of the former if no one has even really played him yet?",
            "He is not even out yet. How can anyone tell?",
            "his specials are unsafe,  so he def not OP",
            "Nerf Bison",
            "SFV bison was a menace.. Plus all day with Axe and ex scissor kicks.. Bomb detonation etc.",
            "It was the exact same in the preview lol. It hsasnt changed since then",
            "Max is a Shoto player, he barely touches charge bully characters like Bison, Balrog, Honda or Blanka.",
            "Max also said he has the slowest walkspeed in the game when it's on par with the fastest. I just think it's hard  to get proper info from the short previews these guys get.",
            "Ever since the first trailer released they showed regular psycho crusher beating single hit fireballs. Idk how Max missed that.",
            "Exactly. I think the wakeup dynamic could be quite interesting between these and drive reversal.",
            "He already does, it's vreversal",
            "Remove the armored one, a worthless move that should have been fireball invuln.",
            "I think it's just a case of the writer being too into Bison's character at the moment to differentiate between being only strike invul, or just flat out invul to anything not a projectile. Akuma's video did the same thing, it only mentioned strike invul but it was immune to throws as well.",
            "What??",
            "Armor doesn\u2019t beat throw loops. If anything it encourages it",
            "U gotta do well in sf6 against zoners to be good. Shotos dominate ranked and tournaments and the other good characters also have fireballs.\n\nFun fact: every dlc character has a fireball in season 1",
            "The one time he didn't was in  Super 4 solely because of Ultra 2. The second he had it you basically couldn't throw fireballs. He did pretty decently against Guile in that version. Once they turned it into a charge input that matchup became much worse.\n\nHowever in this game with the new crusher and level 2 being similar to how it was in 4 he might do fine against them now.",
            "I currently play Honda, but am looking to make the switch to Bison. From the looks of it, Bison has better tools to deal with zoning.",
            ">his Psycho Crusher seems ideal vs Akuma's air options (fireball, overhead and dive kick).\n\nThey didn't really mention it in the video, but every single CPU footage I saw had Bisons just routinely anti-air with Psycho Crusher so I wonder if it has anti-air properties too.",
            "I still don't fully understand this. Isn't the apostrophe in it's in this case making it possessive? You would use it in \"Bison's follow-ups\"",
            "It works like \"yours\" or \"theirs\".",
            "Ultra 2 actually originally started out as a motion input and I believe it was Bison's best Ultra according to info I could find from back then. It was changed to a charge input for Arcade Edition primarily because it was way too easy for Bison to just dumpster you for trying to zone him.\n\nSo yeah, I think he'll be fine here.\n\nNote: For anyone who doesn't believe me, boot up SF4 and set Bison to Super edition. The command list will list it as a charge, but the move itself is actually a 236236KKK input.",
            "He said Bison's backwalk speed was the slowest, but his forward walk was (almost) as fast as Akuma's",
            "he probably is doing them too late, Psycho Crusher's startup frames may not have the invul, you have to be into it like Honda's Super from Super Turbo, you have to be flying",
            "Except it\u2019s an armored reversal that beats fireballs. It has a job and it does it well",
            "Re read",
            "It beats normals which are part of the mixup.",
            "My poor manon",
            "Well, Season 2 is guaranteed to at least have 2",
            "They definitely seem to want fireballs to stay strong, which is why they nerfed Cammy's spin knuckle's fireball invul frames to be in line with other similar moves instead of buffing those.\n\nAs I've become an AKI player in season 2, with her slowest fireball animation these fullscreen fireball punishes scare me. I need to get good at using the EX slither follow-up.",
            "> Shotos dominate ranked and tournaments and the other good characters also have fireballs.\n\nIn S1 pretty much since they're the easiest to master.\n\nS2 seems much more leaning towards long (and disjointed) pokes being the meta, and fireball is pretty much a non factor now. \n\nSo as long as he can handle that, he'll be fine.",
            "For words that end in s, you put the apostrophe at the end.\n\nBut \"its\" already implies the possessive and is a unique case, likely due to the contraction \"it's\".\n\nThe baby and its mother. The tree and its seeds. Not the baby and its' mother, or the tree and its' seeds.\n\nSimilar to his, hers, and their. The possession is baked into the word.\n\nThat move is Tom's favorite, all he does is sweep in the corner.\n\nLars' fireball game is weak. He really needs to work on his execution.",
            "In which case it is a contraction. Bison his.\n\nHowever, in the example here it's makes no sense as its not a contraction. It isn't short for anything. If do go by that logic, the non contracted version would be\n\nIt has follow-ups.\n\nOr\n\nIt is follow-ups.",
            "You really never learned the difference between its and it's?",
            "Yeah this makes sense. The guide states that he can beat fireballs while he's moving forward, which to me means the move not having invul or protection against fireballs on startup.",
            "Yeah cus it so effective that Honda cannot even make it out of pools. It doesn't do jack and doesn't flow with Honda's kit.  Guessing in neutral with EX headbutt is a losing strategy. Even the best Honda player \"Curryman\" never does EX headbutt, even during pressure.",
            "Armor stops throws?",
            "\u201cArmor beats throw mixups\u201d\u2026it literally gets stuffed by throws. Saying it\u2019s an option to help with mixups in general is wayy different than saying \u201cit beats throw mixups\u201d lol",
            "Yeah and it would be cool if Honda could choose between beating buttons vs throws",
            "all I was thinking while reading the thread, not even a good tool against projectiles meanwhile bison punishes you fullscreen with a super",
            "Ex slither is nasty. Ive had people try to di my fireball and i ex slide out and can still get a punish counter.",
            "Stops throw mixups as in you have a reversal with armor. Beats jabs. You have something. Armor, or some invul",
            "I said it beats throw MIXUPS meaning the MIX behind people getting this looped is normal or throw. He has an armored reversal to beat part of the mix. Bison does not have armor but he has throw invul meaning he can beat a throw mix with it.",
            "That would make no sense",
            "See, I need to do that. I've only been playing AKI for a few days to get her nice and cozy with my other hardstuck characters in mid diamond where people absolutely love to DI her fireball.\n\nI keep forgetting about moves she has because she just has so many interesting utility moves. I haven't used the L snake step either after they changed it, and I constantly forget that she actually has grounded HP buttons for poke.",
            "Armor beats throw mixups because it beats strikes?\n\nwhat are you on about?",
            "You know the original post was abt the throw loops. Not the mix up. You know what a loop is right. It dosent involve any strikes just throwing on wake so any non throw invulnerable attack is getting stuffed",
            "Again, I said honda has his own reversal to escape throw mix. This is bisons. Itz that simple.",
            "To give this guy the benefit of the doubt, there are people who will do wake up 2mk or wake up sweep in order to interact with the shimmy. If this is the case, that means mixing a meaty strike in your throw loop will yield a higher punish combo. \n\nThat being said, it's a bad gamble and you're now letting your loop lose to blocking. And half the point is that throw loops are oppressive oki that beats blocking.",
            "Alright, then I say that you are wrong",
            "Then you don't know what your talking about."

Are there other classic inputs that I can use in Modern? Just curious if there's a list somewhere of if this is a strange one off with Dee Jay.\n\nAaaand, I kept searching after asking and found my answer here.

What's his bread-n-butter combo?  I do JHP/HK + std HP + spin kick + shoryuken which does just under 3000.  In some video I saw a longer one that was still safe and reliably able to pull off.\n3. What are his standard dash combos?\n4. In this game, if you're crouch spamming LP on the opponent's wake-up and the enemy is looking to grab you, who wins?  Who wins if flipped?  The wake-up spamming LP or the standing opponent looking to grab?\n5. I use Ken's cr.mk a lot.  It reaches long and isn't punishable and you can cancel into movesets.

            "1. It's good in both scenarios (also canceled from st.HP too) - L/M Jinrai's first hit are both punishable, but pretty hard for the opponent to punish you if you use it at the tip distance. The primary use is to go between the low followup, the overhead followup, and no followup and make the opponent guess which one you're going to do.\n\n2. I think you don't really need to optimize combos at Silver, but if you're interested in learning more damaging ones, you should look into the ones that use the run-enhanced specials. Here's one that might take some practice: cr.LP st.MP HP target combo, cancel into run, run-enhanced dragonlash, shoryuken.\n\n3. Same as above.\n\n4. It depends. Even if you're spamming cr.LP on the opponent's wakeup, if your timing is off, you can still get grabbed. If your timing is right, you won't get grabbed. It's why spamming generally here isn't a great idea, because you're basically leaving it to luck. If you want to practice the timing, go to training mode, set the dummy to throw on wakeup, knock them down, and then walk up and try to time your cr.LP right as they wake up. If you get it right, you'll hit them, and the little \"Counter Hit\" popup will show up. Big tip - try to land this cr.LP at the right timing and go into the combo I mentioned in \\#2.\n\n5. cr.MK is the primary one. st.HP is great too. st.HK has good range but isn't special cancellable. Make sure to just use that one at the tip range.",
            "In the situation you're describing on wakeup, that's very likely the same one as you're describing to start with. Someone mashes on wakeup, they whiff, and their extended hurtbox gets grabbed during recovery. If the command grab had interrupted the mashing, that would cause a Counter Hit instead.\n\nThe other time a Punish Counter happens is sort of an extension of the same concept. If there's an attack that is reasonably disadvantageous on block (eg. an invincible reversal) and it gets blocked, hitting the opponent after causes a Punish Counter. The reason why that is is because you're hitting them while they're still in the recovery of their attack and they aren't actionable/can't block yet.",

So after safe jumps, meatys after specific kinds of knockdowns, and very specific punishable situations like when the opponent is -4 or -5 on block. Those situations are when you can guarantee you're doing x move on the exact frame you need and it *must* be that specific move.\n\nThe harder way is during footsies, that requires training against specific moves and one button or another will be the best choice for each situation that arises.",

If you want to wake up mashing, wake up light attack is usually the one you want to go for.\n\nLights are also a good way to take your turn back/continue pressure during low frame advantage situations, like if you're only +1 or +2. For example with Juri's st.MP, you're +2 so realistically you probably shouldn't push cr.MK after and should stick to cr.LK or cr.LP.",
            "other commenters have covered a lot, I would just add that they're also a good option when it's your turn but your opponent is in your face. doing a low forward or crouch fierce will get you counterhit if they jab, but if you just throw out 3 jabs the second or third jab will counterhit if they try to press.",

Haven't tested this with every single invincible reversal but I'm almost certain every one should work, even the slower ones (like Ed's).\n\nIn fact, you usually _should_ always attempt the invincible reversal if you're able to react in time, which will force opponents to do true blockstrings on you, which are usually weaker pressure-wise than ones with gaps.",

Whenever you see someone constantly doing that, start using reversals (i think they have to be 7-frame reversals, not really sure on that).",

            "I agree that it would be nice to have a more detailed stat screen, and also that MR is the best system in the game currently. But win rate can\u2019t be fully trusted. The problem with win rate is that it can be heavily influenced/boosted if you only play matches against people that are clearly far below you in skill, and a lot of people absolutely abuse that. I myself will often times do Casual and go on a 10-20+ win streak against one person, which inflates my win rate. Sure, I technically *won*, but is that really a good indicator of my true rate when my opponent was a new/lower ranked player? Even then, there are people who go on those streaks and take it even a step further. They\u2019ll simply one and done anyone that poses even a slight challenge, and over time it drastically boosts their %\u2019s.",

            "Just because someone is high rank doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re good dude. I\u2019ve perfected Master rank players on more than one occasion and I\u2019ve never even hit diamond before. I got sliver 1 after placements because I didn\u2019t know how to play him and lost most of them.",
            "Yup, I\u2019ve been noticing it more and more. It seems like people are just straight abusing the ranking system. It\u2019s been a thing since launch, but it seems like it\u2019s gotten way, way worse since Akuma dropped. I would say maybe it\u2019s just a coincidence, something like a bunch of Masters switching to new characters. But that can\u2019t be the case. Once a player hits Master with one character, they can\u2019t place below Diamond 1 when doing placements with another. So these have to be people who are making new accounts specifically to terrorize lower ranked players, which is just corny and pathetic.",
            "Yeah it does not make any sense IMO. I think smurfing is a real issue in games where there's a market for people to buy high rank accounts and/or f2p games",

            "I'm a master Manon and placed plat 5 day 1 with Ed. Fundamentals matter. This person threw their placement matches. Plat isn't high but fundamentals alone would put him mid golds with any character. And clearly knows combos even though it wasn't optimal.\n\nSilvers don't do drive rush into corner juggle into ca.",
            "Not necessarily. I hadn't played for months, my last character is Marisa diamond 1, just picked Ryu this week and the game felt I was diamond 3. Let me tell you, it's MUCH better when the game thinks you're worse than you are, compared to when it thinks you're better than you are. After 200 matches with an amazing 20% winrate I'm more or less where I feel like I should be (plat 4).",
            "My bad dude. i didn't mean to offend you. Should have known how sensitive you are considering you are smurfing in silver.",
            "Yeah seems strange to me since I would have assumed that many people would have the same goal of improving etc. I worried that some people would have felt that way about me playing but to be honest when I\u2019d started again a month ago I didn\u2019t even know how to drive rush so I guess it made sense. \n\nBut yeah I see people wanting to smurf in a fighting game and it\u2019s like what for? It\u2019s just cringe and not fun for either player I would have thought, but yeah if it\u2019s a blatant skill gap that I don\u2019t think I can learn anything from/someone trying to flex for the sake of it they\u2019re usually one and dones for me. \n\nIf I wanted to watch a Rashid/AKI/Akuma/Ed do one of their massive combos I could just go to Twitter/YouTube.",
            "So do they re-buy the game on another account, or can you have multiple accounts on one license?",
            "oh please bro. just stop talking your whining is an actual eyesore, they posted a combo. both players are still breathing and no one cares as much as you.",

            ">That's a person who threw their placement matches.\n\nWhen I switched from modern to classic, I also switched from my Diamond 4 Luke to JP. After practicing for hours, I jumped into ranked and lost every single of my placement matches. I definitely was not throwing.\n\nI'm not sure if I was placed in high silver or low gold but I obviously climbed out of it super fast but my placements were all vs mid plat-mid diamond.\n\nHe might have thrown the placement matches but that's not necessarily the case",

Akuma and Ken have very similar concept in sf6(for now), so since Tokido already decided to play Ken for tournaments, there is no advantage to use  2 similar characters(can not covering each others' weaknesses).\n\n2. Since they are similar, it's easy to confuse them. When using similar characters, basically you're doing the same thing while pressing different buttons. This may cause more mistakes.\n\nAnd Tokido is looking forward to Akumas's future changes.\n\nAbout the Akuma's playstyle, Akuma is pretty much like a glass cannon version of Ryu in sf6. Akuma has a very strong fireball game(basically top 1 fireball) and it seems Tokido don't really like to stand still and doing fireballs all day. Instead players who are favor of fireball games like Daigo can be seen playing Akuma a lot. Tokido seems have more favor of getting close distance, applying pressure and hitting some meaty combos. So Ken seems fit his playstyle better for now. ",

I placed D1, gone back to P5, but now in D4 after having this realization.",
            "Well that sucks. I stole his corner combo and have been using it to great effect, and was hoping to have him available to copy well into the character's future. I'm guessing if the game launched with Akuma, or maybe had him as the very first DLC character, Tokido might have mained him.",

Angrybird went as far as saying that Akuma isn\u2019t even top 5, which is definitely interesting. Meanwhile the rest of Japan has been switching over to akuma, as seen in the recent topanga tournament \n\nThe shotos in general are in a really good position, all of them being considered top 10. Will be interesting to see how the meta develops tho",

I like to rushdown as fast as possible and be directly on top of my opponent, and Ken simply does that better than Akuma. Giving the opponent breathing room is not my thing, and I\u2019d rather rush in and get a low kick conversion than toss a fireball and try to keep people out, lol.",

            "Top 8% is all of the Masters. Most players reach Master and go back to grinding a new character. Players who play MR regularly, 1400-1500 could be top 2% I have no data just speculation.",
            "Master is always getting bigger, and last I saw Master is at 11-12% of the playerbase and 1500+ was the top 5%",
            "Okay, Still 1400-1500 MR players are among the top 5%, that should be good enough for anyone to not look down upon that rank."

            "Would be the ultimate QoL if we could access it from the activities card on the PS5 lol",
            "now give the option to create a desktop shortcut straight to training mode",
            "Aight, that\u2019s a handy QOL change. The tweet says \u201cimprovment**s**\u201d so I wonder what else is getting changed?",
            "I wonder if this means skipping the character select screen also.\u00a0",
            "How about replay accessible from post match options?",
            "Why does logging into the main menu screen take a while? It was like that in SFV too, kinda baffling how long it takes compared to most games these days",
            "The only QoL that matter is : **To be able to quit the game from the training mode/rematch menu !!!**\n\nYou have to leave training mode/quit the match, then go back to title menu, then press start and then choice to quit the game. THIS IS THE WORST GAME DESIGN",
            "Why not just go a step further and let us boot directly into training mode?",
            "A QOL change I think we really need is the ability to reconnect online, w/o having to go alllll the way back to the title screen",
            "Very convenient",
            "Beautiful. Hopefully we get an update that allows us to go straight from a match to the replay soon, because it's waaaaaay too tedious right now.",
            "PS4 load times are awful so this will save a lot of precious seconds.",
            "Upcoming QOL Update - The current menus have been replaced with SF4 menus",
            "Love this! I wish there was an option somewhere in the future to immediately replay a ranked match without having to go all the way back to cfn",
            "holy shit this was actually the only problem i had with the game as a whole. capcom is putting a tent in my pants",
            "Can we have the same for ranked? Or maybe have that an option select, either go straight to training mode or any mode of our choosing from the main menu? Can we also have a minimal input queue for ranked, like I don't need to press accept or ok each time connection with opponent times out?",
            "Now give me a shortcut directly from the PS5 homepage and we are set",
            "Good. Now let us quit the game from anywhere.",
            "Finally",
            "FINALLY. \n\nThere are a bunch more improvements needed (pause while looking for matches) but thank god they\u2019re finally adding something like this.",

            "Now make it auto requeue after connection problem",
            "Just copy everything from Tekken 8s training mode. Combo trials should be built right into training. Or at least have an option to switch between the two without having to go to the main menu.",
            "Amazing!",
            "I hope they allow all characters in practice Only, before you decide to buy em.\n\nCharacter passes are fine but one hour isn't enough",
            "My source says thats planned to arrive soon ^(in season 10)",
            "Why isn\u2019t this already addressed like wtf capcom???",

            "Or set sf6 training mode as Windows boot app",
            "Make it half \"stand-alone\" where it doesn't load anything else unless you tell it to (as an alternate launch of course).\n\nAlso, what I've been wanting since the SF4 days was a way to watch the replays without launching the game but I know that's not really possible or at least not practical at all in terms of resources on their end with today's tech.",
            "With the last character combination used for training mode! Skip the character select screen all together",
            "Yeah I rather have them fix that instead, it takes way too long for the game to load, but eh this is a nice QoL at least.",
            "I mostly just close it out in task manager or alt f4. On PC at least the game sometimes hangs on close requiring a force quit anyways. It definitely is horrible if you accidentally go one more time back past the title menu you have to reload that start lol",
            "??? PC just alt f4, console use the home button and just close the entire app",
            "I really need that. Every time I suspend my steam deck while in training mode, I need to go back to the main menu, reconnect and go back to training",
            "Yeah and I get connection errors a lot and sometimes it even goes \"offline\" takes a minute or two just to get back to matchmaking",
            "there is an option to auto accept matches, and you can queue ranked and casual from within training mode read through the menus",
            "You can it\u2019s in the menu settings if you press start make sure to check all the tabs",
            "10 mins free after facing them in ranked would be nice",
            "I hate the fact that for me to learn the ropes against new characters I need to have a friend who owns them.",
            "Or make it so that SF6 training mode opens when you sit down in your chair",
            "Why is it even possible to return to the title screen? There is literally no reason to do that.",
            "> I mostly just close it out in task manager or alt f4.\n\nneeding to do this is bad design. its way too hard to quit out of the game using it's menus. I don't have Alt+f4 on my leverless. I shouldn't need to map it.",
            "I have the same issue, it just hangs if you quit, it looks amateur lmao.\n\nAlso constant 10-20 of matchmaking is connection errors...",
            "My mistake for not being clear, I'd like an option for it to continuously search for people to play against even if the connection times out, like SF5. Right now I have to acknowledge the time out for it to resume searching. I gain nothing from acknowledging the time out so I'd like that to be automated.",
            "I'd like it to start training mode when I'm pulling up from work.",
            "There shouldn't be, but frustratingly if you get disconnected from online you need to go back to the title menu sometimes to reconnect.",
            "Ah I just sit by my keyboard. But I definitely agree it's either dumb to get to or doesn't work. as you have to get to the first menu screen. And then even when I do that at times it would just freezes up and doesn't close so I gave up on closing it the normal way a while ago.",
            "Just map it if u have leftover button. If not, using Guide + any button. I map mine Guide + start = quit game. Guide + option = shutdown. Guide + up down for volume control. Best qol change cuz when using leverless, i sit far away from keyboard",
            "I'd like training mode to start right as I take my pregame shit",
            "My experience is that happens if you go to fast lol. Need to wait a few seconds in between changing menus and it will exit everytime."
