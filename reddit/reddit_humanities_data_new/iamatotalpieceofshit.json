As well as that, it's against reddit's terms of service- likely for this exact reason.    \n\n\nThanks for understanding. At the end of the day, if it's a real story people will find it on Google, and in our eyes that's great, y'all are fact checking yourselves and that's how things should be when it comes to internet strangers telling you to be angry at someone, tbh.",

            "hey there, im not 100% sure what that Y word means, but we generally will let news videos get uploaded to the sub directly. as far as posts go, we like people to be able to stay on the sub if that's where they started- so direct video/gif/screenshot upload to reddit.\n\nas for the news article links in comments, our automod is very aggressive in order to fight off spam bots and malicious links, and it's about 14 pages worth of regex code (it's been like that since before i got here and has gotten larger over the years from other mods), so it can be at times difficult to make changes to it to allow certain things :/\n\nif you as the OP post the news article as a comment while the post is waiting approval, we do check the comments and can see the removed website- so the news article. that speeds up the approval process drastically as we do like to try and verify posts as well. If I notice them I try to approve the news links if it doesn't look like a sketchy add-farm site, too.\n\nwhat happens tho is people copy paste stuff from the news article and include a ton of personal info as a comment, which is against tos. as well as that we'll remove that stuff as this is when we're allowing random users to explain things to people and they can lie or manipulate the info with the idea that no one will actually check the news article and take what was said at face value.\n\nlot of folks with agendas come here.\n\ntldr sorry, i do want news articles but it's just there's so many scammers on this site and it can be easy to lose track of them in the cracks, and it's very difficult to make changes in automod as ours is extremely large.",

            "you can upload a news video directly to reddit so that its contained in the site, we approve those ones often. links to a news article we dont- but those rarely do well as a post as  redditors want to just doom scroll and upvote or downvote. most people dont care much to go deeper than that so if your goal is to get your post seen that is in your best interest to do anyways. screenshots also do well.\n\nwhen you type out a website automod will kill it. there are multiple paragraphs across the 14 pages set up to target websites and its a nightmare to try and whitelist certain websites without harming the bots abilities to target scammers and malicious links.",

        "content": "Hi folks! Hope all's well.\n\nWe're looking for new mods! We need help with post approvals. In order to prevent the sub from getting banned, and to ensure no one innocent gets doxxed, we approve most posts manually.\n\nMy goal is for people to mod 1-3 times a week and I will do check-ins to make sure no one feels burned out. Please be aware I do spot-check your work as well. I try to ensure that the amount of content on the sub matches what our moderation team can handle, and respect and value all of the mods that choose to help here.\n\nI like down to earth, empathetic, and reasonable people. I dislike mod abuse and agendas, and will work with a mod if that kind of situation comes up to prevent it from happening again. I am very patient and understanding, though.\n\nIf you have an interest in news, journalism, or like posting informative content, you'd enjoy modding here. The mod team is very low-drama and friendly, too. We're fairly active in discord as well if you like shooting the shit, and are all very familiar with modding if it's something you have an interest in.\n\nThis will not be a good sub for you if you need to see progress with fixing problematic behaviors common with large angry groups of anonymous people. The users ban evade and use alts, and the only way to win is to remove the content that brings them here. That of course doesn't mean we just let it run rampant/don't mod, but understand this- there is no finish line.\n\nA better way to look at it is to consider that if you caused everyone to leave forever, they would go to another sub and who knows if that other team would abuse their position to threaten/doxx others, push agendas, or if they would let personal info be posted and unregulated leading to innocent people getting doxxed. The mob's always gonna want blood and a ban won't stop that type of person, but at least here we can ensure no one innocent gets their life ruined.\n\nIAATPOS tries to be as neutral as we can, and focuses on the person being an asshole. I do like diverse teams, and right, centrist, left, whatever-leaning people are welcome. Coming from different countries is of course welcomed, as is knowing multiple languages. I don't want an echo chamber and I want to ensure we have people approving posts with multiple viewpoints to help decide. I do expect everyone to be respectful of each other and keep an open mind, though.\n\nThanks folks, I appreciate it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://forms.gle/zidafinJNvPN2i1v6](https://forms.gle/zidafinJNvPN2i1v6)",

While it's nice to have some extra spoken languages on the team, and we do, we just generally are gonna stick with english and let the country specific subs handle the other stuff.\n\nit also is a problem because we are opening pandoras box to letting the OP tell us what the people in the video are saying, and creates weird scenarios where its like.. \"sometimes we approve other languages, other times we dont, why iaatpos?\"\n\nAnd then that makes mods feel unsure and like they have to approve shit they can't understand, and then we get into problem territory. In fairness we do approve other languages sometimes, but it's just.. idk it's a whole thing.\n\nIdk, it's not a simple fix. I can't just throw volunteer mods at this. Just know we do our best, I consider these things, and we are always open to discussing stuff. One day I'd like to be able to talk to you guys more openly, more often so we can collaborate. I hope we get there.\n\nY'all kind of scary to talk to tho, lol. Angry mobs and all.",
            "yeah i don't really know what to do with those posts. If I don't allow any at all it's censorship, and if I allow them it's an agenda- like I can't win.\n\nI will be honest I tend to avoid them whenever they're in the queue because to be perfectly frank anything I know about what's going on over there is something that I'm being told, and there is an incentive to manipulate this info or push an agenda. I do not actively go out of my way to learn about what's going on there and be as informed as I humanly can. I'm very busy with other subs/servers and a lot of stressors in my life and am just kind of making due with what time I have to offer. From what I understand though it's very one sided and IDF is lashing out at a lot of civilians and in the wrong?\n\nI will find a middle ground and approve stuff where it's just clearly horrible behavior. If it's a scenario where Palestine is in the wrong, I will try to be unbiased and consider approving it. If the country info is just scrubbed completely, I do prefer to approve those. It's tough to do this though when it's a war, it's hard to say someones an asshole if the original cause for the behavior was a loved one being killed or something... But if it's something like calling for the entire country to be nuked, or broad statements that apply to an entire country or group of people, or warcrimes or what have you... Stuff where most people will easily agree it's a pos thing to do and racism, and it looks harder to fake, I'll probably approve it. But it's rare. I feel very out of my element and generally skip them with other mods approving them.\n\nI dunno what to do with it. Get mods that are more in the know, basically, that's what I have to do. Before we had someone that was a lot more involved in that conflict but they left reddit so idk I just kind of yolo it tbh. If I fuck up I am sorry or apologize on behalf of the other mod that approved it, I and the other mods are trying our best.\n\nIdk man I just like shit posting and video games. I've been modding here for like 5 years now, but I am not really some super political, power user that has to show the world something. I just kind of try to keep this place alive, innocent people out of the equation, and my mods safe and happy and then I just wander off and post pikmin shitposts otherwise.",

            "I literally screamed WTF ... This driver deserves a place in hell",
            "If I\u2019m going 40-50 mph I\u2019m not stopping either",
            "People, there\u2019s zero evidence this isn\u2019t incompetence. Why are you all burning this imaginary boogeyman at the stake? Lol what the fuck",
            "No harm no fowl.",
            "Duck sake\n\nThe person is driving a SUV , fast .  I doubt they saw the ducks or if they did , at last minute \n\nIf trying to avoid them would cause an accident then, duck pate it is .",

            "The people recording and watching it happen are worse than the people in their cars that have a split second to react and by doing that could harm others.",
            "Started with 7 chick's. Counted 6 at the end. One got knocked off screen to the right and never came back.",
            "I saw this in person a few weeks where I live and I am still legit devastated. The mother did not make it. The babies wont last long after without the mother.",
            "I think this one elicited a greater reaction than normal from all of us\u2026 wtf man this is just awful",

            "Well done :)",
            "I watched some fat boomer woman do this with a crosswalk that had 3 teenage girls in it yesterday. She was blowing to he horn and making the palm up  what are you doing gesture. They don't care about life in general, even human. \n\nI drove a truck until recently. I got out of it because something changed when people were forced back to work after covid. Any inconvenience or hold up and they loose their God damn mind. Trucks are slow so you guessed it, extremely unsafe and irrational behavior. A friend of mine is a school bus driver. She says the same thing but also has to deal with stop arm violations being way way way up. She's not going back in the fall.",
            "you're a good person c:",
            "Nah people are actually that evil. I used to ride the bus with an old, jaded driver who was rude/dismissive to passengers and would frequently test the limits of \"the-right-of-way\" specifically when she saw younger women crossing the street. Girls would cross the street, she would notice them and suck her teeth super loud, and just barely miss them when she made turns with the bus. Eventually enough passengers caught on to it and she got fired.",
            "Maybe, but there are some terrible people who do it on purpose. I've seen a driver swerve to try to hit a tortoise on the side of the road",
            "Studies where fake animals were placed on the side of the road show that a fairly high number of people swerve to hit animals. Majority of them are SUVs too",
            "That\u2019s horrible. I\u2019m sorry you had to see that. These poor innocent animals.",
            "I hate animal abusers more than anything, I hope he gets cancer",
            "When you\u2019re having a terrible day and slow down to watch some ducklings safely pass, sometimes it puts things in perspective",
            "Last one never returned into the frame. Nine ducklings began crossing the road.\n\nEdit: slowing down the clip makes it look like possibly 11 total. First two walking side by side",
            "which one? looks like they all got thrown around hut right back up to me",
            "Never swerve to not hit animals, dude driving could have easily lost control and hit the person filming swerving at high speed.",
            "For sure you should swerve and endanger the lifes of other people around you!! Very humane",
            "Invasive and underhunted species do more harm than hitting them with your car. If you can safely slow down always do but just think if you flip or anything else you could kill a lot more than some ducklings",
            "law says otherwise",
            "This is what I\u2019m looking for, the most antihuman thing here",
            "They were in the turning lane. The dude left his lane to try hitting them in the center lane. I thought it was an accident at first too but they\u2019re not even in his lane",
            "that guy didn't even stop?",
            "Why the fuck would you drive a car with which can't see properly ahead? (I suppose that's what you meant when you were pointing out it's an SUV). Why would you then drive it FAST? If it was a kid that was a good 5 seconds on the street and somebody hit him full speed, NOBODY in their right mind would be making excuses. Why tf would you make them for animals?",
            "Imagine letting T Daddy live so rent free in your head bro \u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f",
            "WTF",
            "I highly doubt that they are to blame. \u2018Normal\u2019 people don\u2019t expects people to just plough through them. They are more then likely recording because \u201coooh look at the cute duckies crossing the road\u201d rather then \u201cI\u2019m not going to help them because I want them to get hit\u201d that being said the video proves that not everyone is \u2018normal\u2019 and maybe they are there to watch the ducks get hurt. But I like to imagine that the person filming was just clueless and expected the other humans around them to not try and kill the ducks.",
            "What the fuck are you talking about? You sound legitimately unhinged",
            "Counted 8 at the beginning, and then 7 after going through that painstakingly slow. Looks like the last one in the line/the one that got blown completely off-screen actually went under the tires",
            "More like 8, so we lost 2",
            "I counted 9.  Some of them are behind each other, you can't see them all in one frame.",
            "Well be optimistic and just assume it's just seperated and caught up later.",
            "He did",
            "I think one just didn\u2019t get back before the end\u2026 which can mean it\u2019s either dazed and confused or dead.",
            "Yeah the back chick definitely got flatten, fucking shame",
            "The mother wasn\u2019t hit?",
            "I drive a jeep and I would NEVER",
            "It\u2019s a jeep thing",
            "Actually most Jeep owners would help stop traffic to let the ducks cross.",
            "I was crossing the street once when a car comes zooming through. It\u2019s a five lane intersection, no traffic, and this car comes zooming right at me, no hesitation. I had to sprint to the other side.\n\nThe driver looked right at me as I did\u2026 and she was smiling. The smuggest, most shit-eating grin you can imagine.",
            "What the fuck though? I can\u2019t imagine anyone doing this. That\u2019s horrible",
            "There might have been 10. \n\n2 up front at the beginning look like 1. Move it forward a bit to see them split up\n\nThen 2 behind them in a row.\n\nThere might be 3 behind them with the white one in the middle.\n\n2 behind them that split up like the first 2.\n\nThen 1 behind them.\n\nLooks like Dark Green Jeep Wagoneer but not too sure.",
            "I counted 8, and all 8 survived. I could be wrong",
            "I think the last one?? Not sure tbh",
            "Ok ya. That's pretty fucked up. From the shot you don't see that, and just see a car zip by. I'm not going to blame a driver for not avoiding an animal in the road. But going out of your way to hit them is messed up. Not to mention damaging to your vehicle.",
            "The driver is a douche for driving so fast , agree on your points .  But the op thinks it\u2019s deliberate .  Pointing out I doubt they deliberately aimed to drive at the ducks .\n\nSuppose you can still argue they are a PoS but think it overly critical",
            "T daddy??? Eww lol You must be some crazy Trump fan lol",
            "Nah they all lived, i counted 8, one brown one is just behind the other brown one. You can count 8 when they come back together as a group.",
            "I counted 11 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..",
            "Nah counted 7 at the end",
            "I counted 1 that disappeared past the left screen. I may be hopeful with the count but that person is still a dick",
            "People really taking the time to investigate how many there are\u2026 and get 7",
            "Read it again",
            "lol yeah, same. Not a car thing at all. Just your average driver playing on their phone. \n\nOut here in Scottsdale, AZ there are spots with dedicated waterfowl crossing signs. It isn\u2019t much, but it helps drivers paying attention to be aware of what may be crossing. Just the other day a walker had stopped traffic to allow all the geese to cross; it was awesome!",
            "Fuck that I am not stopping the flow of traffic. Just a couple of ducks.",
            "Look at the last duckling from the beginning of the video. I believe that one was run over unfortunately.",
            "I counted 6 but 5 came back idk",
            "Yes, the last one did not return into the camera\u2019s view. Nine ducklings began to cross the road. The white ducklings beside the brown ducklings in the center makes it look like 8.",
            "Ah yes you are that far gone that you can't understand basic humor. Go outside",
            "Yep and slowed down the one that goes off screen comes back immediately after.  None died thankfully.",
            "Eh idk about that, I tried to avoid this happening same situation and ended up with almost 18k of damage (nothing major but new car) that insurance didn\u2019t give af how happened other than the fact I was to blame. In their eyes I should\u2019ve just drove through them and the fact that I made the decision to swerve which inevitably caused my accident. Conscious is clean but I still feel the weight of wrecking my dream car every day within the first few months of owning it, lost a 1/3rd of my lease to this",
            "You must drive a Beamer.",
            "It rolled to the right while still looking like a fluffball, so i think its just out of frame. Would have been flat if the car drove directly over it.",
            "My brother in Christ how did you only count 6, you can see at least 7 on the first frame of the video",
            "You sound hurt haha"
