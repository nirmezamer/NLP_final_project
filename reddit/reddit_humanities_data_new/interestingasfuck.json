            "Look at underwater photos and tell me water isn't blue again. It's just that as a mostly transparent material, the way it works is a bit different to most opaque materials we work with on a daily basis. \n\nA blue rock basically absorbs all light that hits it, then re-emits just the blue photons in semi-random directions (yes, that is a very simplified explanation -- I'm not about to write a detailed course on theory behind light transport in a comment), whereas a \"blue\" transparent medium lets most light pass through, but absorbs a little bit here and there, with less absorption of blue-ish lightwaves (and again, yes, that is simplified)\n\nWhat that ends up meaning is that to \"see the hue\" of a semi-transparent material, it's not enough to shine some light on it. You need to shine light *through* it, preferably through a whole lot of it, and preferably not having other lights not going through it that make it hard to separate what's coming from where. In other words, being pretty deep underwater is the ideal way to see that water is blue (though if you go too deep, eventually even blue light will be mostly absorbed and you'll end up in total darkness), whereas a glass of water or something is never going to look blue.\n\nAnd I guess some people will get to this point and argue that water isn't \"really\" blue, but it's just \"an illusion\". That argument isn't wrong, it's just that that's true for all materials. A blue rock isn't really \"blue\" either, in a fairly legitimate sense. Indeed, objects having colour is just one of many emergent large-scale ill-defined concepts we humans use as convenient communication devices, even though they are kind of not really \"real\" fundamental physical attributes, per se.",

Once ice becomes more than a meter thick the blue wavelength of light struggles to penetrate it so it scatters and eventually gets reflected back to your eyes -- similar to our sky.\n\nIf there is air bubbles or in the case of snow that has millions of angles and directions for light to bounce off of before geting to your eyes, it appears white (pure sunlight -- yes our sun is actually white, it appears yellow because the blue scatters in the sky). Take a look at a snowflake on your car window it is clear, together they are white.\n\nOn an angle the blue light can't penetrate our atmosphere because it is too thick coming from that direction.

Even ice with no air pockets is less dense than water.

            "No, that's not what they mean by absorbing the red light. It is not a cumulative thing \"gathering\" the light. It's about the light refraction. Different wavelengths/colors of light are refracted/reflected at different angles by different impurities and densities in the ice. When some light is bounced around so much that it is reflected back onto the object, that light is \"absorbed\" and turned into thermal energy. \n\nThe light that is reflected determines the color/is determined by the color of the object. Ie, an orange absorbs light that is not orange in color, and reflects orange light. Black absorbs sunlight so when you wear black in the sun your clothes get hot, opposite for white.",

But there are places in the southwest where flash flooding can occur even with blue skies when it rains at higher elevations. You can bring a satellite phone or radio to ask for weather alerts since cell signal can be poor and the weather changes very quickly.",

            "There are many situations in my teen years where I was walking with death.  I used to be dropped off at Hunt's Mesa (which is a 2000'+ tall sandstone mesa that overlooks Monument Valley from it's south) and hike my way back across Comb Ridge, back to town.  Now, on Comb Ridge there were deep holes (cairns) carved into the sandstone.  30ft deep...rounded edges...that are deeply and precipitously carved in sandstone...wells that are scattered with the bones of those poor beings that slid into them.  There's no way out of them. You might as well have fallen into a latrine in Siberia...if you found yourself at the bottom of these cairns.  I was a kid.  I saw these things.  I KNEW that I was cheating death...just looking over the rounded edges and seeing those bones.  This was before cell phones and GPS.",

It's not just a rain storm that causes these floods, it's strong localized thunderstorms, which can sometimes be miles away. It generally isn't advised to go canyoneering if there is a chance of thunderstorms in the area.",

            "The only difference is that slot canyons are like giant colanders.  It may rain 2 miles away but all that surface water funnels into that slot canyon and makes millimeters of water over a large surface into several feet deep in a small area moving fast as hell.  So it may not even rain anywhere near you, or happened hours ago and it suddenly all hits at once.",
            "Well, kinda. Depends on the type of weather being forecasted and the meteorologist. 20% could also mean 20% chance across the 100% area.",
            "Not exactly. Copied from the US National Weather Service:\n\n>Probability of precipitation is predetermined and arrived at by the forecaster by multiplying two factors:\n\n>Forecaster certainty that precipitation will form or move into the area \n\n>X\n\n>Areal coverage of precipitation that is expected (and then moving the decimal point two places to the left)\n\n>Using this, here are two examples giving the same statistical result:  \n(1) If the forecaster was 80% certain that rain would develop but only expected to cover 50% of the forecast area, then the forecast would read \"a 40% chance of rain\" for any given location. (2) If the forecaster expected a widespread area of precipitation with 100% coverage to approach, but he/she was only 40% certain that it would reach the forecast area, this would, as well, result in a \"40% chance of rain\" at any given location in the forecast area.\n\nSo for your example, 20% chance of rain in your area ***could*** mean 100% chance of rain affecting 20% of your area, but it could also mean 20% chance of rain affecting 100% of your area, or 40% chance of 50% area etc etc. \n\nThe important part for most people, is that if you stood outside for the duration of the period, there's a 20% chance you'll get rained on.",
            "What he is also pointing out is that even a 10% chance of rain means that small bit of rain somewhere in the park will eventually get into the canyons. So even a small chance is not worth it",
            "Doesn't that make your chance of getting rained on in any particular spot the same?",
            "thats absolute nonsense. not sure where this info cam from but its wrong. if precipitation is at 70%, then it means theres a 7/10 chance of rain falling in that area around that time. if it says 10%, it doesnt mean 10% of the sky will be covered in rain. this would make forecasts ridiculously confusing.",
            "Absolutely correct.",
            "Where I'm from 50% Chance of rain means 50% on the days in the past with the same weather conditions it rained, making a prediction for the current day based on the past.",
            "No, they are not. It's missconception that has spread over the internet but remains untrue. I think it is appealing because it would be so much easier to understand than having to consider \"tomorrow\" as realization of a random variable.\nhttps://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/90/2/2008bams2509_1.xml",
            "I think it depends on your area's climate. I'm from Vermont  where there's some % chance of rain basically every day but there's definitely days where it doesn't rain at all anywhere around. And recently I moved to SW Utah (very near Zion) where it's very arid and low humidity and typically there's 0% chance or maybe 1 or 2 but on days where the % is even just a little higher it's almost guaranteed to rain but only in one very small area and then maybe another small area later. It's very sporadic and in specific spots. Unless the % chance is very high then it's probably covering the whole region.",
            "No, it definitely isn't. It typically is just the chance of rain that day.",
            "I'm not sure you're interpreting that right. 20% chance means there's a 20% chance it will rain in your area. So every 100 times, it'll rain 20.

This \"it is actually the area\" always annoyed me for how obviously wrong (this is not how most rain works, since you usually have one rain front crossing an area which means if it rains more than a drizzle somewhere most of the area will be covered. Also why would you call it a probability if it's a proportion.) and yet commonly believed it is (maybe it's the new 8 spiders fact).

It does not mean that 50% of the country country will for definite have rain today. It might just not rain anywhere at all, or it might rain everywhere, or just in certain parts."
