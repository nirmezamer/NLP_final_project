            "Ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rde question, in how much trouble am I?\n\nI recently got a Ausreiseaufforderung, meaning I have to leave Germany until the middle of August as I  have overstayed my student visa. My visa expired in March, but there was no earlier appointment date for the Ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rde available than the one in the end of June, which was allocated to me back when I arrived last year. All cool at that moment, as I was informed that I am perfectly legal in Germany as I am awaiting my appointment, although my visa expired. Two weeks before the appointment I receive mail (yeah physical mail) that all appointments were cancelled and that we should send our documents by email, with no specified date. I sent all my documents a few days after my cancelled appointment was due (maybe that is a problem?). A few weeks later (a day or two ago) I received the Ausreiseaufforderung.\n\nI guess that the Ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rde is in utter chaos and that they probably haven't even started processing my documents, or even if they have that they are not synchronized and that they still send me the notice to leave Germany, although I have sent them my documents. Can anyone say in how big of a problem I am and how much will all that last and cost? I will try to contact the Ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rde as soon as possible, but they were unreachable in the past either by phone or by mail, so I'm not optimistic about that. I already googled some lawyers in my city, that are doing immigration law and will try to tell them my issues and possibly make an appointment. Is there anything else I should do, and what is the ballpark of the prices of lawyers in such simpler cases? I clearly do not want to lose any money due to the inefficient bureaucracy here, but is seems I will have to.",

My question relates to the language learner visa (not the university student visa) - if I arrive on the language learner visa, would it then switch automatically to the typically 3 month Schengen visa once expired? (I'm Australian, so the '3 month Schengen period' is the automatic rule for me whenever I've visited previously).\n\nI'm assuming any language learning course that's exactly 3 months or less wouldn't let me get a language visa (as it'd fit into the normal visiting timeframe), so am trying to work out the mechanics to make the most of my time.\n\nCurrent ponderings are:\n\n* If I arrive on a 3 month + language visa, does this switches to the tourist visa automatically? Or do I have to leave Schengen and then return?\n* If I arrive on the normal 'tourist visa' prior to the course starting - does this switch to the language visa once the date for this begins? If so, does it then resume once the course finishes? (Presuming it'd go into the overall '180 day Schengen zone rule' somehow)\n\nI'll ask the local embassy as well, but never hurts for some extra guidance in case anyone here has some insight.

            "Hello, student here! I am moving into a new place in Dessau-Ro\u00dflau, and I've encountered some concerning issues that I'm not sure how to address. The toilet in the apartment is broken, not that it doesn't work, but more like it looks like it's going to fall off anytime soon. It needs repair as soon as possible. What's more concerning is that my roommate informed me that this problem has been ongoing since they moved in, and they had repeatedly emailed the landlord about the broken toilet, requesting maintenance. Six months ago, they responded and said they will send someone to check, but no one showed up even until now. I am about to move in in a few days, and I'm left worried when it will break and when it breaks I have no idea how I am going to the toilet.\n\nAdding to my frustration, the previous tenant, who moved out before me, reached out to the landlord to request their deposit back. Shockingly, they were informed that the cost of fixing the bathroom, including the toilet, would be deducted from their deposit. However, from what I gather, the toilet was already faulty before they even moved in. Now that makes me worried that they will not refund my deposit when I move out and blame the damages on me. I'm at a loss as to what steps I can take to address these issues. Is there any way I can file a formal complaint against the landlord or the property management company for neglecting maintenance responsibilities? And if so, who should I reach out to for assistance? Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help.",

Not far from N\u00fcrnberg so you could check out both.   \n\\-Ravennaschlucht. One of the coolest markets. They setup the markets and lights in a valley/gorge under a viaduct. Very picturesque.

            "hello guys\n\nI just graduated medical school and im currently in the pathway of pursuing medical residency in Germany , i should land a medical residency in Germany by next year .\n\nI recently saw that AFB has won significant portion in the EU and while i know it is the opposition party i didn't know much about it . Upon googling further i was shocked to learn that they are\u00a0**extremely right and even considered Neo Nazis by some Germans . I also came to find that they are extremely Xenophobic and misogynistic in nature the most shocking thing of all is they do have a huge following in Germany with such radicalized and ardent supporters .**\u00a0i have seen such polarization , right wing radicalization happen in my own country and it was ugly where the party supporters feel they are superior to other humans around them and impose their radical views on the rest , claim anyone who opposed their views as antinational .\n\nI'm a south east Asian and brown skin color person , which makes me kind of scared now what will happen if they come to power which seems like a very likely outcome , i will be at the middle of residency by the time ... will i be subjected to racial slurs , discriminated and been looked down upon as the stigma around being a racist/supremist would have be broken ? coz if a party in power assures its the normal thing to do then the citizens will follow suit usually ...\n\nFrom what i heard of doctors who work in Germany who came from my country , they have experienced subtle racism but they people always keep to themselves coz of the fear of embarrassing themselves , but thats about it on the contrary most of the Germans they met were super sweet and extremely helpful . The German colleagues in the hospital have been so well accommodating and very amicable as opposed even doctors from own country\n\nBut reading about the articles online about the activities of AFB has left me least to say horrified , to the extent im reconsidering my decision to pursue my residency in Germany.... from what ik i wouldn't be having a problem with immigration status as im a skilled worker that's not really the issue , what bothers me the most is their attitude towards immigrants, people of different ethnicities and im really scared the German people will follow suit , thus resulting in me having a very uncomfortable experience in your country where i would end up feeling not welcome at all !\n\nwhat do you guys think ? am i a being overly concerned ? i would love to hear the status quo there from the eyes of a German people\n\nPlease provide your valuable thoughts and insights on the situation , Thanks in advance :)",
            "Because I saw in another german sub that people say the right-wing parties would ruin the german economy and mostly uneducated young people voted for them, basically because they are stupid and just listen to \"easy solutions\", here a few links with regards to the german economic trends over the last decades of rule of other parties:\n\n[https://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2023-10/iwf-prognose-deutschland-schrumpft-rezession](https://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2023-10/iwf-prognose-deutschland-schrumpft-rezession)\n\n[https://www.destatis.de/DE/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2023/06/PD23\\_N032\\_81.html](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2023/06/PD23_N032_81.html)\n\nThe years from 2021 onwards are particularly interesting here, although things are not looking good from 1990 at the latest. Now you can say GDP is not a good economic marker, and I would agree, but what about this:\n\n2015\n\n[https://www.faz.net/aktuell/karriere-hochschule/buero-co/oecd-studie-jeder-dritte-auswanderer-hat-studienabschluss-13623987.html](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/karriere-hochschule/buero-co/oecd-studie-jeder-dritte-auswanderer-hat-studienabschluss-13623987.html)\n\n2019\n\n[https://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2019-12/bevoelkerungsforschung-auswanderer-akademiker-deutsche-studie](https://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2019-12/bevoelkerungsforschung-auswanderer-akademiker-deutsche-studie)\n\n2023\n\n[https://www.agrarheute.com/management/recht/fachkraefte-hunderttausende-deutsche-wandern-gruende-608481](https://www.agrarheute.com/management/recht/fachkraefte-hunderttausende-deutsche-wandern-gruende-608481)\n\ndestatis has also shown a consistently negative balance of German migration since 2005, i.e. more people are leaving the country than coming back.\n\n[https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Wanderungen/Tabellen/wanderungen-zwischen-deutschland-und-dem-ausland.html](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Wanderungen/Tabellen/wanderungen-zwischen-deutschland-und-dem-ausland.html)\n\nOf these, between 1/3 and 3/4 have university degrees, and the trend has been increasing over the period. So if you want to make the point here that it's only the stupid people who \"vote for populists with simple solutions\" you have to keep in mind that a not inconsiderable proportion of the well-educated and educated are constantly leaving the country and have already left. They basically voted with their feet, as the saying goes. What is left is people who do not want to leave, for one reason or another, and those who cannot.\n\nOn the other hand, it is not the right-wingers (don't say that the CDU under Merkel was right-wing) who have had the political and economic power in their hands in recent years. Ruin will come even without this, but who or what do you blame? It couldn't have been the previous governments (CDU, SPD, Greens)...",

I also came to find that they are extremely Xenophobic and misogynistic in nature\n\nThey aren't.\n\n> the most shocking thing of all is they do have a huge following in Germany\n\nYeah, overall 20% of people support them, that's a fifth of the country. Depending on where exactly you are in Germany this can be higher or lower.\n\n> From what i heard of doctors who work in Germany who came from my country , they have experienced subtle racism \n\nWhat even is \"subtle\" racism? Aren't you sure they just imagined it because that fear was planted into their brain? What even is \"racism\" nowadays? It's such a vague and overused term that it has become essentially meaningless.\n\n> But reading about the articles online about the activities of AFB has left me least to say horrified\n\nThat's exactly their goal. They are propaganda hit-pieces that are meant to horrify you and scare you into not voting for them or speak out against any support for them.\n\n> to the extent im reconsidering my decision to pursue my residency in Germany...\n\nI can't make that decision for you, but it seems like your mind has been filled with fearmongering from the media, who have a vested interest in opposing the AfD.\n\nFor example, did you know that Germans are straight up forced to pay for their public broadcast services, which is one of the most corrupt institutions of that country? They use that money to finance the outrageously lavish lifestyles of their members, they are caught lying on a constant basis to the point youtubers make regular content out of it, they have been known to insult the German people or even call for the murder of people who vote for the AfD.\n\nThe AfD wants to abolish the system which forces Germans to pay for that and have the public broadcast compete in the market like everything else.\n\nNow how do you think such an institution would report about the AfD? The party that wants to stop their gravy train?\n\n> what do you guys think ? am i a being overly concerned ? i would love to hear the status quo there from the eyes of a German people\n\nYeah, you are being taken for a ride by the media. Dismiss that nonsense, read up on what the AfD actually wants or plans to do if you are concerned and don't want to take my word for it.\n\nAnd if you are still scared just keep to western Germany and live in one of the larger cities, which are all more \"progressive\" and have substantial foreign populations.",

            "Germany is following the same trends as most of Western Europe - ageing population, over reliance on finance, poorly regulated private provision of key services etc. AfD\u2019s solution is to cut welfare, more privatisation, less immigration (almost immediately reducing the workforce). So a growing proportion of the people will need additional state support which the state cannot provide, there will be labour shortages, lower tax takes. \n\nSince the CDU has been in power for most of this time I would lean towards that this has been a failure of the mainstream centre-right. But also the mainstream centre-left has been ineffective at proposing solutions. \n\nWhat I disagree is that voting for far-right/fascism is going to solve anything and is anything more than a stupid protest vote. As a result the centre-right in Germany and elsewhere in Europe moves further to the extremes and legitimises these positions and further polarises society. This happens on the left too and is equally as dumb. \n\nDenying reality is dangerous and the long term failure to plan for an ageing population and all that brings, as well as with climate change, geopolitical threats are all coming home to roost and I am no longer optimistic for the future. \n\nDespite that I would never vote for such nasty parties as the AfD.",

            "Let's break your claims down:\n\n- Ageing population: the right wing parties like the AfD are the ONLY ones which advocate for the value of motherhood, the nuclear family and higher birthrates. All other political direction are want to talk about it and only ever regurgitate the migration mantra, and maybe more kindergartens, or better job-life-balance, the latters not having done anything to help with the ageing population issue. Migration does counteract it, but brings other issues which will be pointed out below.\n\n- Over reliance on finance: the last governments of CDU and SPD mainly have not helped mitigate the loss of the industrial sector. In fact, the CDU (and SPD in a Great Coalition), driven by the Greens, and now the Greens personally have committed themselves to ever more drastic policies that are hostile to industry. Just look at this: [https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/zahl-der-pleite-firmen-steigt-im-april-auf-rekordwert-19703737.html](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/zahl-der-pleite-firmen-steigt-im-april-auf-rekordwert-19703737.html)\n\nBefore it is argued that this is because of Covid, let's look at this:\n\n[https://www.iwkoeln.de/studien/thomas-obst-wer-sind-die-gewinner-und-verlierer.html](https://www.iwkoeln.de/studien/thomas-obst-wer-sind-die-gewinner-und-verlierer.html)\n\nClearly many countries manage to recover from it better. So it is political decisions that do make the difference. It usually is. The political decisions have not been made by right wing parties. The CDU is not a right wing party, not since Merkel, not even centre-right.\n\n- Poorly regulated private provision of key services: I am not sure which ones in particular you would be referring to here.\n\nOkay, those are the issues, now to the claims of AfD solutions. I will be mainly using the AfD main political program from 2023:\n\n- cut welfare: they want to 1. keep minimum wages, 2. improve social benefits for families with children, 3. replace Hartz IV (or B\u00fcrgergeld now) with a system that one still receives government benefits, but the more one works, the less they receive, but the benefits will not to be reduced 1:1 by the money earned via work, so whoever works any job should have more money than one who doesnt, 4. amount of children per family should grant benefits for the pension claim, specifically for low and medium incomes, 5. they want to improve possibilities to take care of elderly people at home. So far, not much cutting to see here.\n\n- more privatisation: in chapter 10, there is no mention of privatisations until 10.8 where the AfD commits themselves to NO privatisations against the will of the people, secret privatisations are supposed to be illegal. but to see a brief history of privatisations under previous governments, look no further than the \"geschichte der privatisierung\".\n\n- less immigration: the big one. this one is true. The point 9.1 is larger than all the previous points combined, but basically: no illegal immigration (duh), reduce pull factors, change in EU-regulations, reduction of push factors in the countries of origin through financial help, aslyum centres in willing countries potentially under UN supervision etc. Doesnt sound very nefarious so far. There is more, but that can be read up by the interested raeder. Now, this is the illegal and non-EU immigration, also the uneducated and non-work-VISA-immigration. There is nothing in the programm to curtail valuable workforce immigration.\n\nTo your point about reducing workforce, let's have a look:\n\nThere is the MENAPT-statistic of the Danish Ministry of Finance, showing that over their lifetime, the immigrants from the so-called MENAPT countries take out more social contributions from the system than they pay in. Can\u2019t link it here, because of the rules, but it\u2019s easy to find.\n\nThere is another graphic that I cant link because of the rules that shows how many fellow countrymen of a certain country of origin are working and are paying into the system, compared to those of the same countrymen who receive social contributions. Again, the MENAPT immigrants fall short drastically.\n\nAnother interesting stat is that compared to the german ratio of for example doctors per 1000 germans, all these MENAPT-immigrants have less of these skilled workers per 1000 immigrants, even the syrians which are the best qualified of these immigrants. That means with more of these immigrants coming in, the effective workforce GOES DOWN because all these people need manpower in the form of social workers, doctors, police, security, state clerks etc. and that is just the immigrant specific one, not even speaking of the difficulties of teaching language, getting them school education, teaching values and laws etc.\n\nCompare all of these drawbacks, having or pushing for a higher birth rate is way more cost effective for a higher workforce. besides, I have yet to see someone show that the AfD wants to remigrate primarily the working immigrants, but primarily the ones without status, without job, with a criminal record etc. so by doing that, they will already short-term INCREASE the effective manpower available since these people largely provide none but take it up.\n\nNow, do you have any more points?",

And we took action- we confronted bigots openly. We protested and took to the streets time and again to fight it. We fight it even now at the thanksgiving day table and cause rifts in our families if necessary- bigoted intolerance is simply intolerable. Anything broken does not need a scapegoat, does not need to be overblown to be solved bilaterally. We will continue to fight it even if it breaks us. What are you doing to fight it here? I haven\u2019t really seen the same backlash we showed in the US, I just see complacency here. I don\u2019t go out much in public anymore, I\u2019m not sure I want to assimilate to a culture that will only see me as less than German.",
            "aha, but the US doesn't hate Germans and Russians hate West in general, I tell it to you as a russian that moved to Germany, I don't want Russia here :)",

            "But the reason why EU countries are moving right is distrust in the EU or?",
            "I don't think so necessarily. In some cases of course but a lot of the populist right have toned down their anti-EU rhetoric (e.g Le Pen, Meloni). \n\nIt also depends which \"right\" parties they vote for. The CDU and PP in Spain are centre-right, taking votes from Green/SPD or PSOE but are very much pro-EU. AfD and Vox are not. But those votes may also simply be protest votes with little agreement on leaving the EU or EU institutions. \n\nAlso the most committed anti-EU people I've ever met came from the left (in UK, Spain, Italy and Germany) so it's murky. There are surely some polls out there showing which parties' voters have the least favourable views on the EU (as opposed to the parties themselves)."

Problem is some can\u2019t handle their drink and can turn violent. Many are just normal and become friendly! \n\nHowever multiple drunk people in crowded spaces react in the way the crowd behaves.

            "This post has brought up so many interesting points. As a Yorkshire man living in london and having worked in Germany this is my take:\n\nThis is my opinion and full of generalisations which of course have exceptions, with that in mind here goes: \n\nThe first thing to understand is the travelling English fans (which op is referencing) will be made up of premier league club \u201caway day\u201d fans. These are the most die hard and the most synonymous with English hooliganism. The demographic is predominantly working class and will also carry some of our least finest citizens. It\u2019s not a representation of the average English person. \n\nThis in comparison to other nations travelling fans (that might not necessarily be from countries that have a culture of hooliganism or domestic leagues/rivalries that are over 100 years old) \nIn other words, you\u2019re comparing a small subset of English fans who are very used to behaving poorly domestically to the decent normal people of the other nations. \n\nWith that particular English demographic in mind, the analysis of post empire Britain and ww2 chants is giving far too much educational credit to the fans singing the chants. I can promise you, the fans won\u2019t have much idea of British history other than Britain winning the war. They won\u2019t have much (if any) education around the empire and to be honest, most English people don\u2019t really know a lot about it. \n\nSo why do they do it? Simple. They think it\u2019s banter, it\u2019s as simple as that. The English believe that Germans lack a sense of humour and that encourages them. If you\u2019re not English it\u2019s kind of hard to explain this but, the English like to \u2018wind people up\u2019 this applies doubly to people who give any sort of reaction no matter how small. Maybe someone else can give better examples of this but English humor is basically built on the principle of taking the piss out of your mates, which becomes funnier the more pissed off they get, or even better if they don\u2019t realise it\u2019s a joke. \n\nOther than that there\u2019s no deeper issue going on. There\u2019s no chip on the national shoulder. It\u2019s simply that British/English humor. Hence why they dress up like knights of the round table whilst they at it. Any deeper meaning added, I can assure you will be completely lost on the English fans. \n\nIn terms of the English German football rivalry. That on the other hand is a big deal in England and English people completely believe it\u2019s a two way street. So much so that I think they any English would struggle to believe that Germany don\u2019t care, it\u2019s hilariously ironic that this rivalry is only perceived from one side. But the English press really fan the flames every tournament, which really doesn\u2019t help but probably sells tabloids.",

I know Germans like to say that they drink massive amounts in Carnival season, but that's only in some parts of the country and only during Carnival: in England it's just a normal Friday night.\n\n> throwing bottles of beer at people, trash EVERYWHERE\n\nOne of my early experiences with reverse culture shock was walking around a British city in the evening and seeing security guys standing in front of every pub and bar, impassively watching drunk men fighting in the streets while their girlfriends wobble about on their stilettos screaming things like, \"Call him off, you bitch, or I'll scratch your eyes out!\"\n\nMy wife, who is knowingly married to an Englishman, has commented that she'll happily spend time with drunk Scotsmen, because they just get friendly and goofy; when Englishmen get drunk, they turn nasty and violent.\n\nI can't disagree. International football tournaments like this one are always a profound embarrassment to me. At least I have dual citizenship, so I can say I'm German and I'm not lying.\n\n> rugby and hockey culture that is nowhere close to this but I have heard of football hooligans\n\nThere is a saying: Rugby is a hooligan's game played by gentlemen; football is a gentleman's game played by hooligans.",

D\u00fcsseldorf, inzwischen zur Residenz des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen avanciert, antwortete, wie es seiner Art entspricht, nur mit leichtem Florett. Die weniger boshafte, sondern mehr rheinische Stichelei dieser beiden Schwesterst\u00e4dte ist eine alte Geschichte, doch bleibt sie ewig neu.

            "This is a ridiculous comment. Such a generic way to describe the \u2018English\u2019. So 60 odd million people all think and act the same way? \n\nWe are one of the most culturally accepting countries in the world just look at our population and religion and ethnic diversity \n\nAnd for those Europeans that constantly bang on about us leaving the EU, understand this\u2026. We didn\u2019t  vote to not be part of Europe. We voted to not pay into a unified European elitist club (aka the EU)  that we paid in more than we got out. And that\u2019s in a simplistic term. Also almost half of us voted against it!!\n\nWe don\u2019t hate Europeans as we are European and always will be. We have fought and bled and died alongside our European brothers and sisters and continue to do so in the name of democracy and what\u2019s right (excluding 2nd Iraq war of course) \n\nWe hold no ill will against the Germans some 80 years after a war that was against Nazi German government not Germans in general. In fact arguably I see the Germans as possibly the most similar to us English in many ways of all Europeans (no offence Germany only our good traits \ud83d\ude06)\n\nEnglish or should I say British humour is very complex and mostly sarcastic and tongue in cheek and self deprecating. Hence the \u20182 world wars and one world cup\u2019 when we neither single handedly won either world wars and won a very generous world cup when Germanys record against us is significantly better\n\nAlso the \u2018footballs coming home\u2019 song is exactly the same thing. It\u2019s a joke at our expense. We are very very well aware that football hadn\u2019t come home for a very long time and it\u2019s again self deprecating and sarcastic. Of course footballs not coming home it never does.

Hay could be tossed down to the stables from the attic via some sort of opening.\n\nSide effect of this is that the heat from the animals also heats up the rooms above.\n\nSide effect is that those arrangments really like to catch fire and when an attic full of dry hay burns, no fire department on the world will be fast enough to save that building.",

They can have a word with the guy; if they continue to get complaints, they can ask him to leave the premises and not return. There is probably a clause in the house rules about respecting other patrons' privacy that they could cite, for example.

I got stared at before but this was another level really.
