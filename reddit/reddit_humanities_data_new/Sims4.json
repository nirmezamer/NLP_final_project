            "I cant launch my game.\n\nIve tried repairing it, reinstalling it, clearing the EA apps cache, and restarting my PC. Nothing is working!!!  \nI uninstalled my mods already",
            "This latest update has done nothing but make my game unplayable and miserable beyond compare. I've tried playing with no mods, some mods, and ensuring those mods are updated when I play with them, but I keep running into errors while loading the game and simply playing. My build-buy mode is horrific, and I can't play for a whole 15 minutes before my game freezes doing basic game activities. \n\n  \nFor instance, Im running no mods at all (mod folder has been removed and is sitting on the desktop) and no tray files. I tried to have my sim take a puppy into the front yard, place them on the lawn and tell them to go potty and they froze in the middle of sitting the puppy down and now I have a white screen over top of the gameplay, asking if I want to wait for the game to load or close. Ive tried closing of course and that wont work, prompting me to have to use the task manager to force close the game.\n\nSorry for venting, just hope it's just not my game and a side effect of the latest update.",
            "Apart from a small number of now redundant bugfix mods, my mods and game appear to have survived this update relatively intact, which is unusual. Of course there might be glitches I haven't noticed yet but the game loads up and appears to function.\n\nDX11 seems to have significantly worse performance for me. Especially when moving the camera while zoomed out there's noticeably more lag and stutters.",

I can't click to get rid of it and its literally fully restricting me from using build mode. I've updated my mods and gotten rid of the broken ones, game was running fine last night but updated it today and I haven't been able to use build mode since.",

Has the mod list come out yet?\n\nI don\u2019t mind patches but the piecemeal nature of them has gotten exhausting. Are they going to keep patching things for years to come?",
            "The 5/28/24 update is making my game bug out so bad. All my mods (which are just a couple) are updated but suddenly my game is so laggy and unfun. EA is driving me insane and I regret spending as much as I have on this game",
            "Anyone else having issues  with the game not moving past the loading screen after the update?",
            "Another custom content issue. They are disabled but I cannot re-enable them. I go into the game, get the warning, select to enable them in settings, exit the game start over.  Same note that they are disabled. Tried this FIVE times!!! Its not re-enabling mods/custom content.\n\nEDITED: I found the solution online. I had to disable my virus protection and then re-enable it. Then it worked!!",
            "Hello all, I have a strange glitch going on. 90% of all male sims in my game, Mortimer Goth, Bob Pancakes, Malcom Landgraab etc have become women?\n\nIt was entertaining at first but... now I've fixed tonnes of them it's become annoying. Also, no matter what I do the male sims retain the bra.\n\n***The bra persists.***",

I can\u2019t click on any lots to move my sims into. Sometimes they show up as a blue box or it\u2019s just a world that is completely unplayable.\n\nI haven\u2019t found this issue anywhere so if anyone can point me in the right direction that would be great. \n\nI\u2019ve removed all mods, repaired game x2, uninstalled and reinstalled and still can\u2019t get it to work. \ud83d\ude2d",

I removed some mods that were causing issues, mainly color sliders and more traits in cas, but I\u2019m constantly getting stuck on saving (never ending loop so I\u2019m guessing every time I attempt to save it\u2019s crashing), and almost all of my custom wallpaper shows up as big question marks. If this is a move they\u2019re intending to make fully, I can only imagine how much normal build buy cc will be affected. \n\nI spent the entire day trying to build and decorate lots and not being able to save. Tomorrow I\u2019ll try with no cc at all aside from cas items. I\u2019m really hoping that will at least allow me to play, but it\u2019s unfortunate to see so much cc that\u2019s all maxis match and no longer usable.",

I un-installed and reinstalled the game and the EA app, repaired the game, cleaned out the cache, did a winsock reset, launched my game through steam and validated my files through there. I even emptied my CC folder and started a fresh game with new files and zero CC/mods and still, no matter what, the game crashes. Sometimes it crashes in the middle of CAS mode, or even if I manage to somehow finish making a sim, it crashes in the middle of gameplay. \n\nIs anyone else experiencing technical difficulties like this or is it just me? Furthermore, any advice om how to fix this problem will be highly appreciated! Thank you!",

There is no fix for this and it makes the lots impacted completely unplayable. It crashes if you try click on a household, you get error 800 in build mode, none of the usual things like taking out your mods folder, deleting the local thumb cache, repairing or reinstalling your game etc\u2026 work. I\u2019ve even seen threads where simmers have tried manually altering their own save files with software unsuccessfully.\n\nSo I have decided to take it upon myself to create a petition to try and get EA\u2019s attention to fix this as the number of impacted players is growing. Can you please share this? I feel like a petition with several thousands of signatures is the only way to get EA to fix this one\u2026",

I thought it was a fluke, but when I clicked on them, there was no price tag, only a download button. Thinking I was lucky, I tried downloading them only to be met with an downloading error. \n\nSo, I tried contacting support, trying to be the honest person, letting them know that the packs got into my library by mistake. Except, I got met with \"this concern has reached out team and we're doing everything we can to fix it. Good bye!\".

But, my other thought was maybe that it was damaged, so I checked it in light, and I only saw a few scratches then and there, so I wouldn\u2019t think that that would be the case for me.

I don't even like mods that add settigns menus that can't be hidden, so I can get a bit uptight about it.\n\nI've tried srsly's cooking overhaul which I love for the detail (and adding shopping as well) but I can't get past that it adds debug items to the shopping sections and I can;t find a way to remove those items or make them invisible, it also has a slight conflict with part of waffle's gardening rebalance which I'm using to make gardening less profitable, tying in with their nectar rebalance.

Either the barstool or dining chair has to be a fun color but nothing too bright or too dark. Both need to have black legs and a back. Both need to be cushioned and be comfy looking\"\n\nI've been trying to find stuff like this on Google to not much luck. It is a bit of a tall order, so that's probably why I haven't had much luck. Was hoping people more involved in the game could help. Thanks y'all!",

I have tried to find a game like sims that me and her can play together and like most I thought she would like either role playing games or simulation type or survival games but really could never find it. Then it hit me when she was telling me about her new sim. Sims is not a world building game it\u2019s a Story Telling game. Every sim every building, every murder sim that she didn\u2019t want apart of her story is my wife telling herself a story. She designs characters, makes there homes who there family will be or is, how the sims friends are or enemies. When it begins, and how it ends. I once thought how could she sit there for hours and play that sims game. \n\nNow I understand how someone who loves sims can put it down for months and then want to pick it back up again. Perhaps your last story wasn\u2019t your favorite, maybe or felling less creative or you feel your stories just have the same pop they once did. \n\nBut just a few months later life has happened and now you have more emotions and complexity in your relationships or job. Now you have more stories to tell and you remember why you loved the game. \n\nNow I see the different sims family and homes my wife is proud to show me, is her being proud of this complex story she has in mind for these characters.\n\nSo I have a new found awe of the creative minds who love sims.

He then stopped playing after a week because \"he did it all\" and \"it's too easy\". He clearly doesn't get it because I've been playing Sims for over 15 years and haven't run out of stories to tell myself. I guess if you're used to playing games with set goals, linear stories, and predetermined outcomes, playing a game you have to completely make up yourself might not be that appealing. \n\nThat said, I like to switch up stories with building and gameplay challenges to keep things interesting. I also like recreating apartments and houses from my favorite movies and TV shows. Sims is a sandbox and there's endless things to do if you are creative enough to build it!",

            "The way Will Wright (the creator of the first Sims game) describes it in his Masterclass, is a dollhouse. Just to play with life, and give people tools to tell stories. Goals and extra game play was added to help with story telling, but the intention was never to just turn into a standard videogame. Imagination should always come first. Yeah, the game can't do everything we want, but just like with dolls, we can always pretend it happened.",
            "It's like playing with dolls, where you can dress up the dolls AND build the doll houses. You can come up with your own storylines, and make family trees with the size and complexity of GRR Martin's fictional family trees, and with all the plot twists in the world.",

You understand it from the outside - that kid is waving dolls around and talking to themselves.

Maybe it is because I was bullied, or because I'm just not as exciting and outgoing as I'd like to be.\n\nThe popularity among women and LGBT people may partly be because of this, but these dynamics are also always self-fulfilling prophecies. Players tell their friends, the game gets an image and marketing is directed towards that image. Also the games were actively more female- and LGBT-friendly than real life, let alone other games. Since the beginning, female sims could get any job, receive the same payment. And everyone could date, marry and adopt children with a same-sex partner. Honestly, I think Maxis deserves more credits than they get for pulling this off in 2000. 20 years later, it was still enough to get the game an 18+ rating in Russia.",

            "No not yet, it's not even half finished lol sorry!",
            "My EA ID is Wagyubeefcubes, but this is not even half done so I can't upload it yet sorry",

            "Oh... I don't know much about houses so I never thought about that. Thanks for pointing it out",
            "No, not yet. It's not even half done :(",
            "Thanks, but no, not yet! It's not even half finished",
            "That's what I was thinking. With the greenery and the water wheel, it looks like central or southern Europe. Although, if OP were thinking Connecticut suburb intentionally copying old world landscaping, I could see red brick.",
            "...so many. It's not done, and I've already used 12. I will make a list when it's done",
            "That is such an interesting and comedic description XD Ty",
            "I will upload to the gallery later when it's done, but now it's not even half finished lol",

            "Ok I'll update you when it's done! Need more time before I can upload it onto the gallery",
            "Hmm I never thought of it that way... now you said it I might not be able to unsee it LOL",
            "Thank you! Yes I built it, but no it's not available to download yet it's not finished. Will upload to gallery after it's done.",
            "a matches better my bad dident mean to his send yet\ud83d\udc80",

            "Thanks so much! I only have one build on the gallery so far. The other one has too many CCs so I uploaded it elsewhere. I plan to upload this one as well when it's finished, but this is not even half done lol",
            "A is cleaner. I like it because it has the adobe southwestern US aesthetica. B has the charm with red brick, but there's already a lot going on there with the architecture & greenery. A is better because it balances all out.",
            "It's just a bunch of medium spraying water emitter hidden underneath. You will have to play around the placement to get what you want.
