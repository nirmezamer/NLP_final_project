        "content": "Hey all. While playing EDH and getting paired in a pod, I got put in with a guy with a Nadu deck. He claimed he hadn\u2019t looked at the deck in a while so he wasn\u2019t sure what it did (which was suspicious since Nadu is MH3, so we can leave that where it is). Anyway, I played like 4 games before I left. Every single time he\u2019d just deck out and play the card that said if he had no cards in his library he won. He\u2019d just tutor shuko and then scute swarm and draw cards until he won. \n\nI was able to stop his infinite one time with Gates of Madara, but I still ended up losing. I don\u2019t mind losing, that\u2019s part of the game. It\u2019s just frustrating to be playing against a cEDH deck. He said it was \u201cfast mana\u201d and not cEDH but he\u2019d win by like turn 3 or 4. \n\nAnyway I told him that I had nothing with me that could remotely compete with the deck he was playing, and he just kept playing it. \n\nThen at the end, he was like \u201cI think this needs work before it can be a cEDH deck I\u2019m like 90% there\u201d so he knew what he was doing. \n\nMy question is is there anything you can say to a person that\u2019s doing this without sounding like complaining that I\u2019m losing?\n\n\nEdit: here\u2019s my deck for reference. Full disclosure, Nadu is in the 99, but is not abused with 0 equips or anything like that. \n\nhttps://manabox.app/decks/e5uModgyTd2O0fpsaiHKWQ",

We take a 'break' until they jump into another pod.\n\nBit easier to pull off if you go with a few folks in your play group or established as a regular at the lgs with folks who get the memo.\n\nI'm not worried about politeness when guys are playing to be jerks.

I\u2019ve been on and off my whole life and back on now and loving it. Though, maybe it\u2019s just me or because I\u2019m old school, but I hate decks that let someone win without actually \u201ckilling\u201d the player through life total. For example, I find myself unable to build mill decks (or library burners as we used to call them) because it fells so dishonest. I know people might get mad at that, not trying to throw shade at anyone. I\u2019ve just always been an aggro player and like to run damage right at your face.

            "*nods.* That's reasonable. I think the best way to actually describe it is to find the best deck (in this case, Blue Farm), and find decks that are capable of competing with it. Then, recursively construct the metagame. Decks that are capable of competing with the metagame (i.e., have a reasonable matchup spread against the rest of the metagame) get added to the meta. If a deck doesn't have a reasonable matchup spread against the rest of the cEDH metagame, it's not a competitive list. \n\nNow, the problem is that Nadu is, inherently, an insanely powerful individual card. A deck that is just \"Nadu + good stuff with Nadu\" is capable of presenting a win on turn 1 semi-consistently, and while that doesn't quite reach the level of competitive without further work put into the list, it's still far above what almost any other casual deck can manage. It's incredibly hard to build a mediocre Nadu list, because Nadu + some infinite targeters is already a very powerful deck that can scam many games. \n\nBut yeah, to your question of \"how fast is fast enough to qualify/how consistent is consistent enough to qualify\" - there is no single metric. Turbo Ad Naus decks aim to win on t1/t2/t3, and probably lose if they don't get there. Farm decks can scam t1 wins, but are defined by the ability to grind. Some archetypes - which are usually jokes, but still cEDH, such as Orvar - simply grind for 10-15 turns before going for any win attempt. \n\nEach of those decks, however, is either:   \na) Capable of going for very early win attempts;   \nb) Capable of stopping very early win attempts. \n\n\"How early\" has a very simple answer - turn 1. You need to be capable of interacting on or before turn 1, or presenting a win on turn 1. Otherwise, the deck has no chance at being competitive. Yes, there are other factors for what makes a deck competitive - but without one of those two, you're just dead on arrival.",

Puts some of my instincts to words in a way I never could, and gets into the real intricacies and nuances of deckbuilding in a way very scarcely replicated on the platform. I think I do know a lot of the things he says already, but yeah it\u2019s just how he articulates it. Puts to words the things that like- it\u2019s hard to explain. Deckbuilding is intricate, with moving parts and nuance that get a little lost in the theory especially when you get used to it. \n\nHe lays it all out well.\n\nI think his content is still definitely a little more catered to a more involved player, like a very new beginner may have a bit of trouble following, but if you\u2019re anywhere from interested in deckbuilding to a seasoned brewer, you will get something from Salubrious Snail.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty amazing.",

Some of the highlights for me:\n\n- [[Altair Ibn-La'Ahad]] and [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]] are the 2 I am debating between for an assassin tribal deck\n- [[Haytham Kenway]] and [[Shay Cormac]] are both flavourful and seem fun to build around\n- [[Ratonhnhake:ton]] could be an interesting flicker/combat phase commander and will be funny to see people struggle to pronounce\n\nAdditionally I think the showcase arts will look great in the command zone and I think both the secret lairs themed around it look good.

Otherwise, we're basically just using the same cards, so that's really disappointing.",

Everyone is already digesting MH3 or gearing up for Bloomburrow, the 2 biggest tentpole releases of the year.\n\nThey have the winning formula for UB properties... themed commander decks with a small supplemental round of collector boosters.  They should stick to that and not these shitty micro boosters which are pretty universally reviled.\n\nThe weakness of UB properties is if they are not curated and done with extreme care, they end up looking like gaudy advertising cash grabs.  The first few UB releases were done on high quality properties, with extreme care and effort.  This one is not at that bar, and it shows.",

[[Arbaaz Mir]] is a neat take on burn, [[Sigurd, Jarl of Ravensthorpe]] is a nice, aggressive saga commander which can manipulate them well, and [[Surtr, Fiery J\u00f6tun]] is a simple but other fun way of  burning opponents on cast.\n\nWith Arbaaz, I'd likely focus on reanimation so I can at some point explosively burn the table, Sigurd would be a bit voltron-y and try to get more boast triggers, and Surtr... I dont wanna go artifsacts, but probs the most reliable way.",
            "I really didn't think I'd care about this set, and I'll probably wind up ignoring it but there are 2 main things drawing me in.\n\nNumber 1 is the templar knights. I'm considering running a templar knight/dragon's approach mega deck that's just trying to search out a thrumming stone and burn face. I probably won't build it (and if I did I'd proxy all the 'any number of' cards) but I think its a cute idea.\n\nNumber 2 is Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad. No, it doesn't matter what his mechanic is or what he does; I just can't help myself from pronouncing his name in a questionably politically correct middle-eastern way and I would make everyone in my pod giggle/cringe every time I brought out the deck, cast it, attack with it, target it myself or respond to someone else targeting it.

Universes Beyond should always have precons and Assassin\u2019s creed would have been perfect for them, they could have done it like Doctor Who where the games were grouped by deck. They also could have done cool themes for the decks like Historic for the most recent trilogy of games( Origins Odyssey Valhalla), Assassin typal for the first set of games, Pirates for AC4, and idk for other one. It just makes no sense why a MODERN set gets precons but this one doesn\u2019t. This set has some good cards but nothing crazy (I think) like MH3 and LOTR",

I don't care for the art, the cards/mechanics aren't interesting or good, and I'm not swayed by the IP.\n\n\nTo be completely honest I'm happy the cards are bad. I really hate the idea of a few great cards being printed in a non-Magic IP that I don't care about. But other than avoiding this particular issue it's a completely miss for me, there's nothing I care about.",

But I always figured that UB in general were commander-minded from the start, so seeing one drop with no consideration for commander kind of boggles my mind. I'm also surprised more people aren't up in arms on the fact that they try and push UB stuff that's clearly more commander focused (like fallout) in packs alongside precons.
