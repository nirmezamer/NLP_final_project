            "super hyped, and it's coming this month too!",
            "Loving the Sulfur/Coal mining camps.",
            "There are sulfur and coal mining sites in this video too. I can't wait for that so I can set up a proper breeding base.",
            "the hype is real, holyyyyyy",
            "HOLY SHIT! I knew the update was gonna be big but I never thought it's gonna be THIS big!\n\nAnd it will come out in 20 days? I will be SO looking forward for it.",
            "Did anyone have Oil Rig on their bingo card?",
            "20 days ! I am so excited all the new pals omg!",
            "so soon, so many games releasing around dawntrail",
            "a white, pink chillet my life is complete now",
            "The design for the new faction boss's pal is amazing!",
            "Oh shit, Pocket Pair has been busy.",
            "Get your PocketPair W's here, get em while they're hot!",
            "New Blazamut? Hell yeah!",
            "They really deliverd. Didn't expect something this big so early in Early Acces.",

            "Legit, everything looked great. It's a shame it's smack dab between Elden Ring and Dawntrail . \\_ .;;;",
            "New Pals all look amazing. \n\nI'm gonna put a ring on the new tower boss. \n\nEnvironment looks really nice. Even the swamps I usually dislike in the games seems pretty good though I hope they don't neglect the base games map and try to improve it before the full release too.\n\nMy only nitpick is I don't like the variants. They all are just recolors. Some kind of work, like Katress, Wixen and Vanwyrm but making Quivern green doesn't really make it a grass element.",
            "Ya'll are really giving me five days to beat Elden Ring DLC?\n\nChallenge accepted",
            "That moon pal looks pretty cool and the guns seem great!",
            "So the Enclave have shown up, interesting...",
            "Here is a simple list of updates coming in the Sakurajima update.\n\n* A new island with lots of different biomes like cherry blossoms.\n* More new Pal, including a mimic chest that seems like a little puppy, but is deadly.\n* Dedicated servers for Xbox players.\n* A new increased level cap.\n* New buildings and crafting stations.\n* New \u201csubspecies\u201d of existing Pals, presumably like fire-breathing Chillet.\n* A new raid, faction, and bosses to fight.\n* A new stronghold set on an oil rig.\n* A PvP arena mode.\n* New Weapons like a four-missile rocket launcher, a plasma rifle, and even a flamethrower.",

            "Oh this is going to be a straight banger, well done dev's! There hasn't been an equivalent of \"stronghold\" as far the dungeons go so I'm really curious as to what that even means, but l guess we'll see in few weeks\n\nThe hype is definitely real folks",
            "Is 27th of June for us on Xbox also ?",
            "Can't wait to see how big the new island is on the map! Looks like they're putting a lot of effort into the update, can't wait.",
            "This is the only game I was excited for news. I\u2019m still deciding on either continuing my save or starting fresh.",
            "Well I be able to turn my current world into a dedicated server?",
            "But can I please have a palbox expansion if there\u2019s going to be all these new pals?? \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",
            "Looks like new weapons and armour as well!\n\nCan't wait!   \nWonder if old savegames can be used - or a brand new playthrough is required. If it's a new island with no change to existing landscape, it should be ok?",
            "27 June? That's a bold move given Elden Ring release just 6 day later and FF14 Dawntrail release just a few day later",
            "I am stoked for this update!",
            "Of course I heard the word but what exactly are dedicated servers gonna be because I know people been waiting awhile for it",
            "Wow that seems like a pretty big content update actually. Hope the player base hasn't adhd'd off to something else already.",
            "This looks pretty lit, love the new biomes",
            "I thought Wixen and Katress swapped was just fanart!",
            "Ok 7 days to beat elden ring dlc until this comes out",
            "Amazing",
            "Lets **GOOOOOO** \nThis is so much content for a title update, hype is real",

            "Gatling gun for player? Finally",
            "Gatling gun\nSulfur and\nGoal ore mining spots",
            "will I need to create a new world for all the things to be added or will my current world be updated to have everything??",
            "Pocketpair pumps out a lot of quality content for not even that big of a company lol",
            "was not expecting all that shame its such terrible timing. Oh well no need to rush the new content atleast.",
            "God.. daaaaaaamn",

            "Everyone get your sunglasses, the future is looking bright \ud83d\ude0e",
            "The new frog boi, mushroom boi, and Golisopod look-a-like are going to be instant additions to my roster. Fucking hyped.",
            "Will xbox dedicated servers require a new game, or will players be able to continue on a previous save?",
            "Sweeeettt",
            "I'm so hyped for Arena! Hopefully a it will allow community servers to truly thrive!",
            "This\u2026seems promising.\n\nAnd dedicated xbox servers too?\n\nAnd (presumably) bug fixes?\n\nMight pick this game back up.",
            "Just hoping this update won't be damaging Ll my mods, other than that, waiting impatiently.",
            "Imagine being prepared for this. When BellaNoir dropped I was so unprepared, but my fully complete game with 40 100-100-100 Jetragons are ready to cook this time bois.",

            "I\u2019ve been away for a while. Are the worlds hosted online yet (ie if 4 of us play together can people now jump on without the original person who started the world)",
            "Heck yeah Palworld Gen 1.5!! Loving everything I'm seeing!\n\nKiiiiiiinda wish the variants had a bit more variety to them than just recolors, that seems a little... little. Can't we get some more like Elphadrin Aqua or Relaxaurus Lux with their head ornaments or something? Just a \\*little\\* more of a design change than just a pallet swap would be nice. At least some pattern differences?\n\nGrillet (if it is indeed Grillet) IMO should'a 100% had its chest pattern change at least",
            "So excited especially when I resized it drops while I\u2019m on vacation!",

            "I didn't play for a while but now i am really thinking about playing again, the upcoming things look awesome.",
            "I wasn't expect an update from these guys until maybe late this year / early next year.  Wow, what a quick turnaround.",
            "Cool update, but my hopes for an Ice/Fire Blazamut Cryst were just crushed to smithereens...",
            "I do hope the new faction will be more than just \"Another flavor of bandit\"",
            "can't wait :DDD",
            "Is this gonna cost money like a dlc would?",
            "So does this mean gamepass players can join my dedicated server on 6/27?",
            "bit worrying that they don't seem to be interested in making any of the current unfinished areas a bit more dense, there's a really good foundation here but it's all it is, early access foundation... \n\nI mean I know I'm gonna be in the minority on a subreddit for this game, but who even got far enough into this game to play an expansion? I get that on this subreddit its the enthusiasts who have really enjoyed each aspect, but I'm really shocked because I don't know anyone at all who was playing this after a month. I mean it looks great, but everyone I know just stopped playing when the content ended? Will we have to play through the entire game to access it?\n\n\n\nThe game paces itself really well in the first part and you get access to lots of new biomes all with their own signature pals, but once you beat the 2nd boss it's pretty much over in terms of content. The volcano has some cool stuff but then the path just ends and you fly up a giant rock face and beat the boss. And there's like 2 biomes on the whole place and they both already featured on the map. \n\nThere's nothing in the desert or ice islands, look how big they are and how few waypoints. Why aren't they removing the placeholder content? Are these considered finished by the wider community? I don't even mean to be facetious, but that's a LOT of borderline featureless landscape to grind through.",

            "Maybe it's a level 3 stone mining site? It's hard to say from what's in the picture\n\nIt doesn't really look like any stone nodes in the game right now. It looks like a new material. Or maybe a newly minable one that already exists.\n\nI really hope that tower in the background allows for mass harvesting of pals.",
            "Not oil rig but for a long time a oil stat was on Pals and seen through data mining.",
            "can I look forward to nuclear power plants? and NUKES?!",
            "What does Oil Rig even mean? Is that PVP stage they showed? That's what it looked like to me\n\nThe one before the arena\n\nIt looks like Stronghold is a type of PvP (is that a mode in halo, where you have to hold like 2/3 zones I think it is? It's not king of the hill. I'm pretty sure it's called Stronghold.)\n\nI think Oil Rig is the first Stronghold - style pvp map.\n\nI am fucking psyched.\n\nI think Stronghold is 3 points in Halo, Arathi Basin was the same concept but it was balanced over five points.",
            "ME!\u00a0",
            "Right?! I'm going insane here. And I still have to work!",
            "Our Lord and Savior Yoshida already gave us time for elden ring dlc. Palworld gonna have to wait til after MSQ",
            "They're all vying for players time. Same reason why so many games especially gatcha's all update on the same day.",
            "You can play the new Palworld update while waiting for login queues for Dawntrail lol",
            "Yeah looks like Blazamut-Noct maybe?",

Some kind of work, like Katress, Wixen and Vanwyrm but making Quivern green doesn't really make it a grass element.\n\nIf you go check the discord, you will see a lot of people wanted variations, even if it was just a color change. Imo, it is good, as this is how most variations were already. This will be a problem if they would have only released variations.",
            "[deleted]",
            "I'm disappointed the new raid boss is just blazamut but PURPLE. Like, they could've done literally anything but that and it would be interesting seeing as it's dragon type.",
            "It was shown in the PvP announcement a while back",
            "In the video it got big tree in background so maybe same map",
            "It should just be a new area, I\u2019m guessing to the west of the volcano since the tree is the center",
            "Someone host a game is a sever but a dedicated Server is someone who pay for a server so people who played with them don\u2019t have wait on the one person to play on same world",
            "Get ready to wait harder then. My body is ready!",
            "They already have ore mining site in the game. It was added in the latest big patch a few months ago.",
            "No way. We don\u2019t even need that much ore",
            "I hope they eventually just make a legit way to do it how some devs like DE take bugs and just work them in officially",
            "I think those are just clear walls. Also one second later in the video you see what looks like an oil extraction setup",
            "The crane looks like the top of the ore digging facility or spot like the stone one; but much larger footprint.  It appeared in the last large update.  It has towering, jagged, faded-looking ore outcropping and a large levering crane exactly like in the video.",
            "Another form of automation and a way to extract (from pals) in the works?",
            "I hope I'm not asking too much by saying I do hope they give us more melee weapons. I'm looking forward to the possibility of a chainsaw sword.",
            "Looks like PvE",
            "> I think Oil Rig is the first Stronghold - style pvp map.\n\nOil Rig had Syndicates running around it. Seems to me more like some sort of unique dungeon thing.",
            "Oil rig in the datamine is another resource gathering building. Looking at the flameflower weapon i'd 100% put money on it being required for that but not sure what else. Just to give you a heads up Jetdragon has a hidden lv3 job suitability for oil... but our lord and saviror astegon whos also nocturnal also has it.",
            "I was like \"even dawntrail need to delay for Elden Ring, no way palworld gonna compete in THAT\"",
            "Don\u2019t read if you don\u2019t want spoilers >! but, according to the datamines it\u2019s Blazamut Draco, which should be very interesting, I wonder if it\u2019ll have a dragon-fire passive like siren of the void, I\u2019ve been predicting a dragon raid boss next since PP probably doesn\u2019t want the armies of Bellanoir we\u2019ve made to obliterate it, I\u2019m just surprised it\u2019s a variant of a pal we already have !<",
            "That\u2019s what I was thinking. Whatever it is, I wonder if it\u2019ll have a Siren of the Void like passive.",
            "Sure but can't we change the models a bit for variants rather than just recoloring them?",
            "I would have preferred a giant Cattiva, just to be funny/ironic.",
            "Must of missed it back then. Still excited it will be out in this patch",
            "PP has said the tree is the center of the full map they\u2019ve planned",
            "Ah like ark? That's what I thought",
            "You will. When making a battleship that is. XD",
            "Look at the one on the right. They are cubes. They're not walls.",
            "It does almost look like there is a door on the one on the right. I wonder what that means?",
            "Pretty sure they're ice walls as in new building material types",
            "You mean the tech 2 one? I'm curious about what that is. I have only logged in to check my eggs but if it's really the same post a pic and I'd say good eye.",
            "That doesn't look like ore, stone, coal, sulfur, or quartz to me though. Where have you seen that before?\n\nIt looks like there is definitely a newly minable material coming; whether it's a material we already have or not is impossible to say.",
            "Perhaps.",
            "I think you might be right. I got excited by the name of the content but now that I look again it does look like small group content.\n\nI'm just editing my post over and over as I see random stuff in the video so I appreciate the comment. I think you might be right!\n\nI love PvP and I want to see quality PvP implemented in Palworld but I also just spent all of Thursday playing Baldur's Gate 3. Small group content has been core to all non single player RPGs maybe forever. I'm happy to see they're adding some to Palworld.\n\nI do think you are right.",
            "You think so? I'm gonna go check it out again",
            ">!If it has that, that will be the best pal in the game that we know of so far!<\n\n\n\n>!The double type advantage of fire would make that the strongest pal in the game!<\n\n\n\n>!And every Blazamut Draco player in Arena will have an Orzerk (or equivalent) in their pocket!<",
            "Wow, i am not that much of a reddit user but i was amazed to see that u can really censor things on your own like this. I really appreciate that u use that function with a good spoiler warning. <3",

            "Oh, did they confirm that? I remember people having that theory but I didn't realize they confirmed it. That means the initial map was only like a quarter of the total size!",
            "Yes",

I grudgingly spent the points for the tech 1 one as you need to do that to unlock availability to spend points on the tech 2 one.\n\nIt has a huge foot print and a big wooden block and tackle crane as pictured.   Is that one there,  I'd think so but they graphic could be used on something else.\n\nit is that tall though.  As high as the first floor of the Pal Barn at my my mining base.  That first floor is three wall tiles high at lowest rising to four and five as the roof is sloped.",

The rocks on the ore spot never deplete, and are not colored like the \"natural\" ones; they are like a big, more jagged and sharp faded brown. Like a \"less pure\" ore node that has to be knocked at continuously which you can, or rather put two or so turtles on it to dig at it.",
            "Honestly the strength of a pal isn\u2019t really in its typing, it more in its exclusive moves.\n\nBellanoir is the strongest pal currently because it\u2019s exclusive move it\u2019s insanely powerful. As well as Dark cannon being OP.",

I don\u2019t think Blazamut Draco will be a fire/dragon type (but it might, I\u2019m only going off the data mine)",

It seems like the worst part of viewing cages is that it renders every pal that it stores.\n\nA few months ago somebody suggested maybe just selecting one or a few for display and then having some way of seeing them all.\n\nI have no idea what this is, but I wonder if that's it.\n\nI have no clue, but why would they show two 4x4x4 sets of walls in their promo video?\n\nPocketPair has so far done a really good job of responding to their community and this was a community suggestion that was very popular when it was posted.",

I really hope they rebalance this.\n\nAt the same time, as I'm sure you know, the way it works right now if you let  your Pal play a bunch of high CT moves it just sits around like a sitting duck.\n\nObviously there's two way two approach this, and I think a hybrid approach is the best. Status abilities like the vine effect for example, have great impacts on your dps. Freezing your opponent lets you tank longer. \n\nThere's a balance to this and I don't think that face tanking everything is the answer.",

And you probably don\u2019t want to take a -20% boost to your damage, that\u2019s like a free passive\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile you have stuff like the bellas, frosty noct, Shadowbeak, Astegon, Jormuntides, etc. have at least 2 CT STAB moves and a hard hitter, and those will attack extremely fast\u00a0\n\nThis is all just speculation though\u00a0",

It is that low mesa at the entrance to the Anubis desert.\n\nThey are just far enough to prevent a base border from encompassing both, it was one or the other so I said fuck that.  I visit it to mine it now and then, but bummed some stacks of coal from a friend the one that beat me to the mesa with all the coal on top, since he has infinite coal.\n\nFor the coal site in the new video, I plan to put one at my ore base, probably covering a natural ore node which I no longer need due to the tech 2 perpetual ore spot.

You only really need 1-2 low CP moves, so if you can trigger the appropriate status off spamming them it's worth having one big move to take advantage of the damage multiplier. With several statuses immobilizing or limiting mobility, the risky windup for most of the big moves is mitigated.  \n\n\nThe status-based damage multiplier becomes even more powerful in multiplayer with coordination between attackers.",

Haven't played with lightning stuns yet. I field an Orserk sometimes out of desperation but I haven't noticed anything. Usually if I get to that point I'm too deep in the palbox to see what's going on.\n\nI should mention that I was using the defense food and not the attack food when I tried that. I didn't find it worth it, and I think that was a factor in the number of losses.",

            "I like this.  The bridge there makes a cool defensible entrance.\n\nMy ore base is the one on the south point where it is \"autumn\" and has 8 ore nodes.   I put away all the gold bricking pals for a clear pic and with the natural nodes un-mined you can see the difference between the natural ones and Ore Spot tech2.\n\n[This is my ore depot with *Barndominium*](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2466363797111282333/AB695F0E0E343E6F96A7A997CAEF312FCAA32BD2/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false).  I had to split the thing with the small farm on the upper level.  I am proud of the catwalk.  It leads to quarters for the character upstairs under roof which I've done zilch with.  \n\nThe block and tackle cranes on the ore node tech 2 are apparent.  There is a color difference between the natural ore nodes and the constructed ones.\n\nI kinda dread another resource but if the one in the video is different it uses the same cranes...and at least there is a build-able node so we don't have to scrabble for another spot.\n\nThe future coal spots if not location or island restricted will go maybe on upper level or on one of those ore nodes in foreground.\n\nThe [red sky bug I spoke of is shown here](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2440458973150201804/5FE9CB9EBD6570B2B740C031C832AC4ADCADD4C6/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false).  I've not seen it for a minute but when going to the fortress city in the west or volcano sometime the \"effect\" follows ya home.\n\nThe sulphur spot will go at my [main base here](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2466363797111282144/E6EC121E185445A1C0FA2DBED14BC668A014771C/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false), as the ammo lines are there.  This base features a two story barndominium; both floors pal height.  My breeding scale is modest in comparison to some on my server.  \n\nThere is one base on our server on a mesa with ~~five~~ seven breeding pens each with 12 incubators, I've not gone that far.  10 incubators on the second floor next to the three story blender are enough.  My breeding does bottleneck but I'd need a dedicated breeder base for more throughput and I built a third base just for Bella boss, which she wrecks each fight so I can get parts for the glasses and whatever else comes later.\n\nLooking at my screenshot I see items not picked up.  Every time I log back in...they work when offline but not as much...you can see they were gold-bricking and the items all piled up.  If I work around doing stuff in about thirty minutes it is all picked up by the Pals.  I think they just sit in the hot tubs and eat jam buns when I am offline.\n\nNone of my bases use walls, I like a clear field of fire.  I only have part walls to hide from view of a few random rushoars or wolves that walk by and interrupt my workers, otherwise I have fire lanes, as long as spawn points for raids never change.",
            "Months ago I was wondering why I did not have viewing pen tech...they are not on dedicated servers apparently.\n\nIf we, on our server, all had viewing pens with the various menagerie \"out\" I'd guess we'd prob bog down our server.",

The coal mesa also is not raided. \n\nNow that my Pal Boxes are level 20 I qualify for the \"good raids\" so now I like ammo and pal souls and xp books to come to me.\n\nMy main base they spawn kind of close but ore base they spawn far off so I have plenty of time to mount the Barndominium Roof with Mossanda Lux (he is newly combined to four and grenadier is level 5) and grenade them as they approach.  They never reach the actual base.",

            "I made this new game a few weeks later and while I don't have as many high level pals it's been a lot more fun for me.",
            "Worst thing that happens is you make a bunch more 10 hp potions. Best you get a stock of the new ones and then use all that time to save up for the next ones.\n\nIf I was gaming super hard, that's what I would do. You just roll it forward until it doesn't matter anymore.",
            "Also, when are you ever going to field 92 pals?\n\nAll these videos are of people getting their dragon type raids wiped during phase transition when they become vulnerable. \n\nI asked on the discord a few weeks back why people weren't fielding blazamuts instead. I now have three pair with perfect dps passives and 90+ IVs, bred totally naturally.\n\nWe are starting to cook :)\n\nI know I can beat her already but my slapdash Bellanoir raid on my current save could pull about 28 seconds so I want to see what a good raid I have bred myself can do on Libero.\n\nThe nerds making Palworld videos these days obviously never fought Ragnaros. Libero is like an order of magnitude less complicated in phase two but the idea is the same - dps goes from being essential to a liability, but one you also need.\n\nWith Rag it was tanking and positioning to save dps from damage. I'm doing that here with potions. \n\nThis doesn't look like Patchwerk, it looks like Rag. I would say Sapphiron but they would die in the first ten seconds on that fight.\n\nSquatty Potty nerds are losers.\n\nI'm gonna go burn one and upgrade my breeding pairs. Nice chatting with you.\n\nIf I wanted to learn how to face tank I would watch YouTube."

So breeding for IVs imo are better.\u00a0\n\n\nYou get them from beating Libero, and fighting her it's recommended you have a team of gobfins, a fast mount and 2000 assault rifle rounds for your legendary assault rifle.\n\n\nSo yeah, not only is it RNG which fruit you get but the fight itself can cost a lot of money and sulfur needed for ammo.\n\n\nI have used a couple for my Digtoise though since his IVs were poor.",

        "content": "Just discovered this and thought some people might benefit from it.\n\nI built a base near the alpha Anubis to periodically kill it for large pal souls each day and to keep . But there's an added benefit that I didn't even think about. I had left my game running over night for egg farming, but when I woke up, I found a ton of new material in the chest.\n\nIf you AFK in the base, you will regularly get raided by Pal Alliance guys, who drop medium and large souls. Make sure you fill your base up with some heavy hitters and they will just mow the invaders down. They also dropped rockets, assault rifle ammo, training books, money, and polymers. The best part is you can come back from being AFK, and immediately go and defeat the Anubis for more pal souls.\n\nIf you have a strong Katress, send it out in your party so you can increase the drop rates too. Pretty sure the humans are all neutral, so I imagine they should increase drop rates. Will study this and report back when I know for sure. I was told Vaelet would work for Anubis farming, and I'm training one of those up now for that, so I imagine Katress should work for the Pal Alliance dudes.\n\nCoordinates are: -152, -177\n\nOh, and it also has a sulfur node and an egg. Pretty much just give them beds, baths, and salads, and they're good. You can also build it up quite nicely for farming Bellanoir, which is how I have mine set up.",
