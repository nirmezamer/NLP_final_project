        "content": "Hey r/tax, I'm a relatively new mod to this group in the last 3-6 months, looks like the long time mod quakerots left a few months back and quite a few of the AutoMod actions are outdated from the pandemic, so I'm looking at updating the rules and AutoMod commenting and would like to get feedback from subreddit users\n\nAs a reference, [here's the post](https://old.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/3zf1bs/before_you_post_see_if_you_can_find_your_answer/) that used to be pinned with a bunch of the IRS links, unfortunately I don't think people in general tend to look at pinned posts if they're looking to get a specific question answered\n\n**AMA Announcement**: There will be an [AMA on Feb 12th with USAToday](https://old.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/1anizkt/upcoming_usa_today_ama_feb_12th_noon_to_3_pm_et/) personal finance team 12-3pm ET\n\n## Rules\n\n### [Current Rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/tax/about/rules/)\n\nThey're pretty simple - be nice, don't solicit business, no self promotion\n\n### New Rules\n\nNo AI generated comments/content - it's low quality, and we're not here to be AI fact checkers\n\nNo discussion of tax fraud - openly suggesting/supporting tax fraud calls into question the reliability of the comments here, of course people should always take reddit advice with a grain of salt, but suggesting fraud on top of that just degrades the subreddit\n\n**Anything else specific that frequent subreddit users would like to see added?**\n\n## AutoMod Commenter\n\nI've removed all the oudated auto-comments/removal, here are the new ones I'm thinking of adding - note that these would just be an FYI comment on the post, the post itself would not be removed, just saves frequent users the effort of linking the same things or re-iterating the frequently asked questions around this time of year\n\n -  **Explaining how tax brackets work** - users could comment \"!ELI5taxes\", AutoMod would reply with a breakdown that's frequently repeated here - if someone has a preferred example they've seen here please link it in the comments\n\n -  **Explaining how tax refund works** - users could comment \"!ELI5refund\", AutoMod would reply with the paying cash at the grocery store example plus explaining lower refund vs lower paychecks\n\n -  **Return vs refund** - I've seen this one frequently mentioned as an AutoMod request, but I suspect figuring out the right regex trigger would be tricky as I wouldn't want it to just be blindly commented on every single post mentioning a tax return or refund\n\n -  **IRS withholding estimator** - [links to tool](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator) for updating W4(s) with summary of frequent mistakes like double counting dependents for married couples or not properly accounting for multiple jobs\n\n -  **Dependents** - links to [IRS dependent tool](https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/whom-may-i-claim-as-a-dependent), if someone wants to draft a summary with it then you're welcome to comment it here, just not sure if that's necessary as it could get lengthy \n\n -  **Do I have to file** - link to [IRS tool](https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/do-i-need-to-file-a-tax-return) plus summary\n\n -  **Others** - wishlist that may be helpful, but not sure if these are really needed/not sure of regex trigger\n\n  - $600 threshold for 1099-K\n\n  - Do I have to include x income?\n\n  - How do I report income without a 1099/Do I have to? (similar to previous)\n\n  - When will I get my refund?\n\n - 1099 vs W2 misclassification\n\n - Can I claim x if I work from home? (Think these have mostly died down the last 1-2 years)\n\n**Open to any reasonable/genuine feedback on these from frequent users of the subreddit**",

While we welcome diverse perspectives on tax policies, promoting such statements is not only misleading but also illegal. This subreddit does not support or condone the promotion of illegal activities.\n\nTo clarify:\n\n* **Tax Policy Discussion:** Constructive conversations about tax laws, policies, reforms, and their implications.\n* **Illegal Promotion:** Claims or suggestions that paying taxes is voluntary or that there is no legal obligation to do so.\n\nIf a comment promotes illegal activities, our practice is to delete it and consider banning the user, either temporarily or permanently, based on their comment history.\n\nThis policy is in place to ensure that our subreddit remains a reliable and law-abiding resource for all members.

It doesn't mean you can choose not to. You can either voluntarily comply, or you will be forced to involuntarily comply when the IRS catches up to you, those are the two options. Usually voluntary compliance is more pleasant.",

When filling out the SS application it doesn\u2019t ask if you\u2019re current on taxes but it will ask about income and health insurance coverage (approximate income amounts, dates coverage began, etc). \n\nTo find out if your dad owes, you can create him an account on the IRS website using ID.me (he\u2019ll have to have a valid ID) OR you can request his transcripts online. \n\nYour dad should file 6 years of back taxes (2018-2023) as that is generally what the IRS requests to get back in compliance with them. You can do this for free or hire a tax preparer. If his tax situation is simple, I\u2019d recommend doing it yourselves. He\u2019ll have to mail in 2018-2020 while 2021 - 2023 can be e-filed. \n\nThe statute of limitations for the IRS to COLLECT money is 10 years but the statute of limitations for us as tax payers to get refunds is 3 years - so who knows, he might even get some money back for the 2021-2023 tax years. At a minimum, he should get a stimulus check back\u2026.assuming the IRS withheld those payments due to non compliance?\n\nYes, wage garnishments go through pay checks and not through the IRS.

Also be aware that there is NO benefit to waiting until after age 70 to submit a Social Security application.  Maximum monthly SS benefits are paid when benefits start at age 70.

If he owes, the IRS will usually catch up eventually based on their records, and assess tax with interest and penalty.  If he overpaid (and was due a refund) in all of those years, there is basically no consequence other than the fact that the refunds from more than 3 years ago are forfeit (and he would not have succeeded at avoiding child support anyway).

        "content": "While doing my 2023 taxes I was informed that someone else had already claimed my daughter. It was my soon to be ex husband. He was with our daughter maybe 10% of the time the whole year. He said he did it because he would get a larger return and it was going toward my kid\u2019s braces. I think you know where I\u2019m going with this. I asked him about it and he\u2019s ghosted me. I\u2019m really certain it\u2019s gone. I know it was incredibly naive of me, but he\u2019s been emotionally abusive towards me for a decade, and I\u2019m still trying to put my pieces back together. What can I do? He lives in a completely different city, and my child went to the school here, so I think I can prove it. I could really use some guidance as to he to proceed. ",

            "Paper file your tax return and claim your daughter. Once the IRS processes your return, they'll contact you both asking you to provide information supporting your claim of being custodial parent. When you do, you'll be granted the right to claim her and the IRS will adjust his return to remove her and he'll have to repay any benefits he received for including her on his return.\n\nIf you have a concern that he'll do this again in the future, you can request an IPPIN for your daughter so he won't be able to.",
            "School records will be on your side.",
            ">soon to be ex husband\n\nWhen did you get separated. You are the custodial parent now, but were you living together in 2023. Who provided more than 50% of support in 2023?",
            "This has happened to me in the past. If you went ahead and filed trying to claim your daughter as well most likely what will happen initially is the irs will send you notification that someone has claimed your daughter before you and the proper steps to follow to prove otherwise. You need to go to your daughters school and ask the office to write you up a letter with the school letterhead that states the exact dates ie sept 2023- June 2024 blank attended school in this district while residing at blank address. It took a few weeks for me to \u201cprove\u201d I rightfully could claim my daughter so my taxes were then processed and my ex had to pay back the money plus penalties. Hope this helps.",
            "And make sure your divorce decree states who can claim your daughter going forward. Hang in there!",
            "That\u2019s illegal. You can report him as a tax cheat and get rewarded 25% I think, of whatever they recover.",
            "Just came to say this. You have the correct answer here.",
            "Thank you!",
            "IRS won't automatically adjust it. They will send a notice to both parents asking for 'proof' that the child lives with them.  It does not matter what the decree says, IRS only looks at their physical address.\n\nSchool or daycare records should indicate the custodial parents' address.  Medical records might show the other parent as the responsible party but SHOULD show the custodial parent's address as the child's address. If Head of Household was involved, IRS also questions that most of the time. They will want proof the parent paid more than half the rent (full rent  before subsidies) utilities, food (and food stamps counts against them) etc.  But on very low income Head of Household does not make any difference other than make it likely the IRS will send a notice asking for proof. Head of Household requires paing more than half the cost of housing, groceries, utilities, and if there are subsidies the taxpayer has to pay half of everything as if there were no subsidies. \n\nBut as someone said, file your return including the child. You WILL get a notice from IRS with form 556-something asking for birth certificate, proof of residency (school, medical records, lease) etc.  It will take them many months to fix it, but you'll get paid interest on the taxes they owe you. And it probably won't happen again.",
            "The end of December 2022 is when we separated. I provided the vast majority of support",
            "Thank you so much!",
            "The IRS doesn\u2019t care about divorce decrees.",
            "u/RileyRush is absolutely correct. As far as the IRS is concerned the custodial parent has the right to claim the child. The custodial parent can grant the non-custodial parent the right to claim the child for certain, limited benefits (like the Child Tax Credit, Credit for Other Dependents, and Education Credits) by providing them with [Form 8332](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8332.pdf), but the custodial parent still retains the right to claim the child for other purposes, like Head of Household filing status, EIC, and the Dependent Care credit.\n\nIn the case where a divorce decree states who gets to claim the child as a dependent, the custodial parent would need to provide the other parent Form 8332 for those years. If they didn't, the IRS wouldn't really care, but the non-custodial parent could take the custodial parent to court for violation of the agreement.",
            "Divorce decree is state. IRS is Federal. IRS does not care about a state court ruling. There is a form the IRS cares about where the custodial parent releases certain tax benefits to the non-custodial, IIRC it's an 8332, but this is an actual paper form that has to be filled out as part of your taxes, and sent in. The way you use your divorce decree is you get the state courts to order your ex to sign the 8332, and then if they do chintzy shit like claim the kid despite signing the 8332 they get to be in contempt of state court.\n\nIf she's on the birth certificate, and the kid has been in her house 183 nights of 2023 she gets all the tax benefits.",
            "Meaningless.",
            "No. It doesn't work that way.",
            "I work for a tax agency and this is the way. To expedite the process, attach a copy of the court ordered custody agreement or other proof to the paper return, then when contacted for proof, advise it's in the document on file. Speeds things up a bit compared to waiting for the letter asking for proof then sending it in.",
            "You're very welcome. Good luck!!",
            "Sometimes the divorce decree states one parent as the custodial parent but the child stays with the other parent.  The decree is irrelevant.  If the custodial parent refuses to release the exemption with the 8332, that is a civil court matter and IRS does not get involve. \n\nSo the decree works for the state systems but as far as IRS is concerned it is irrelevant.",
            "But everyone here is focused on the term custodial, which is the present state. We need more info about their living arrangements last year. The dad is the \u201csoon to be ex\u201d if they were living together in 2023 and the dad provided the majority of supporting the household, he would be entitled to claim the child. \n\nThe IRS doesn\u2019t care about their current situation, the IRS cares about what their situation was during the tax year"
