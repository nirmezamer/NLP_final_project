If I paid for a degree, I sure as hell am going to use it in whatever way I deem necessary. I flaunt my MME all the time. It's empowering. I paid for it. Jumped through all the hoops. I'm going to claim it.\n\nOne final note, maybe it's just me, but I love pushing back on the quote \"those who can, do. Those who can't, teach.\" It's bullshit. The original quote was, \"Those who can, do. Those who understand, teach.\" Big difference. By adding her MBA, this teacher is saying, \"hey, I have a master's in business.

            "        Not a teacher or a student or even really academically inclined, but I have a question! I worked at a restaurant where we hired a virgin cook who used to be a k-2 teacher (over 6 years). She confided in me that the reason she  quit was her entire kindergarten class one year couldn\u2019t read, so she asked to be moved up to first grade the next year. When next year came, the kids still didn\u2019t know how to read. The following year she was involuntarily reassigned to be a second grade teacher, where she found that still, all the kids in the grade could not read. She was very specific that they literally could not look at letters on a page and know what they were. \n\n        My question to you all is, is this indicative of your collective experience with this age group? What about later in life? Do the kids eventually figure out how to read? Do they require intervention? It just boggles me that there are children at a 0 reading level cause if true I feel that reflects much more on the parents in society than the teachers. Who doesn\u2019t teach their kid to read? Is it generally part of elementary school curriculum to teach children how to read? I dunno I\u2019m rambling at this point"

I don't think we need to police girls in tank tops and boys in shorts (I've seen it happen) but I do think that we should be modeling and teaching kids that different places have different dress codes. You don't get to show up to your office jobs in a F21 crop top that looks like a bra if you're a girl and you don't get to wear a shirt that says \"bad B\\*\\*\\*\\* P\\*\\*\\*\\*\" if you're a guy. I think kids can dress to express themself without looking like they're going to strip clubs and this doesn't mean we're \"slut shaming\" or being sexist, it just means we're trying to teach kids that the way you dress impacts the environment and we want an academic learning environment, not a party or a beach club.

I asked her how she would feel if I showed up to pick her up from school in a skimpy bikini.  It's not appropriate to the situation.  It is the same as if I went to work in my pajamas.

Hell, when I was in high school once I got sent to the principal's office because my school provided cheerleading skirt was too short- which was a subjective call made by one of my teachers mostly because my butt was bigger than the other girls wearing the same outfit. It was humiliating. Something like \"don't wear provocative clothing\" is too vague and impossible to judge fairly.\n\nI will say that I'm not opposed to uniforms (like khakis and polos), but also think those uniforms need to be provided by the school and not something parents have to pay for.

They were taken directly to ISS and given a chance to \u201cfix\u201d the dress code violation. 90% of the time they did. About 10% of the time they chose to stay in ISS. If a student became out of dress code during the day, teachers only had to ask nicely once, then call for ISS or admin to come remove them from class. Rarely happened because everyone knew what the rules were. \n\nI think we can have dress codes if you don\u2019t make me, the teacher, solely or primarily responsible for policing it and meting out the consequences for failing to comply with it. If you can do it the way my alternative school did it, it can be a positive thing. Students always want something to fight about or test their limits on. It may as well be a school uniform.",

I keep up the dress code for work even though the semiconductor industry is a pajama-day kind of job, and I know I\u2019ve moved up faster because of it)\n\n\n-It taught us to be conscious of our appearance when it really professionally counts (see first two points)\n\nCons:\n-It widened the perceived wealth gap; I was on scholarship, and let\u2019s just say you could tell who paid the full price\u2026 you\u2019d see Burberry and Louis Vuitton on some kids, TUMI backpacks on others, and yet others like me who are forever indebted to ye olde Nordstrom Rack\n\n\n-Many of us don\u2019t know how to dress weekend-casually, and I am frequently over-dressed a bit when I meet friends for drinks or whatnot\n\n\n-Like me, I imagine many of my former classmates are prone to unfairly judging others in a professional environment based upon their dress, which is becoming less relevant all the time; like I said, my industry is an everybody-wears-pajamas-to-work industry, and I would likely subconsciously want to promote someone who dresses well above other candidates, because in my mind, wearing pajamas to work is just an absolute no-no, which I admit is totally old-fashioned and likely not correct anymore\n\n\nTL,DR: I had a strict dress code in high school.

I'm always concerned whenever there's a rule that infringes on their rights as individuals. Obviously, there need to be rules in school, and some level of infringement on their rights is necessary. For example, they can lose some of their freedom of expression when I tell my class to sit down and be quiet, as they are not allowed to talk then.\n\nHowever, I want to limit any unnecessary infringements as much as possible. Having rules about clothing that go beyond what the city law requires feels like an overreach.

Also i prefer that my children are in sportsgear, when coming from school, then they can spontaneously run, climb the rocks and trees, play ball with their friends.

She's got pants to wear (thanks to The Children's Place having slim fit pants). But it's too hot for pants at the start and finish of the year. I will probably go with the jumpers because I'm not having luck finding skirts that fit.\n\nSo basically: uniforms are nice if they can work on a variety of body types. Options are good!

If you were wearing a plain black hoodie or a non uniform white polo or whatever black shorts, that was acceptable. As long as it was uniform colours and your shirt had a collar. People usually found a version of the uniform that worked for them.\n\nSome schools are very strict on exact uniform though which of course is not great for a lot of students for reasons including diverse body shapes, but also a lot of other things. Allergies, skin sensitivities, and sensory discomfort associated with the fabrics used, requiring more modest clothing for religious reasons, being unable to afford multiple sets of uniforms. It's also very frustrating for teachers being expected to inspect everyone's clothes and make sure that's a uniform branded plain button up shirt and not a generic in the same colour.\n\nNon strict uniform on the other hand does make things simpler. Students generally do wear something in line with what they're expected to, calling someone up on wearing something else is rare and usually straightforward. No rules lawyering, just \"that's not uniform\".\nWhen I was in primary school I remember there was a stock of spare uniforms kept at the school and if you came out of uniform the \"punishment\" was just being given uniform in your size and being told to change into it.

Your body was made to be ogled and criticized and showing your stomach or shoulders or legs is a distraction to learning, women existing in clothing that makes them comfortable or happy is a distraction and requires discipline? \n\nThe amount of time spent disciplining a student for dress code is asinine. What are the real distractions we have in our classrooms? Collarbones or Cellphones? \n\nI want to add that if a school decides on a uniform, I don\u2019t take up issue with that. But a public school that has a dress code. No. It\u2019s so stupid. \n\n[just one of many articles](https://digitalcommons.law.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1086&context=elj)",

I was doing it nicely and kindly because I cared about them so it took a little to sink in but when I started asking more of my kids they started giving more. You just need to be REALLY careful about when and where you ask.

I worked my ass off writing my own No Fear version they'd understanding, teaching them how to translate the text, what words meant, showing them movies and letting them be really hands on with it. They were amazing. I had parents call me up crying because they never thought their kids could do that and they never had the opportunity. Same thing with other kids too. A super gang involved kid never brought in a folder. I spent weeks arguing with him about it. Finally I called mom and dad and they went out the next day, got him a folder, and he kept it in the class. My relationship with him skyrocketed after I raised the bar on simple things.

            "Ok so I live in a high cost of living area of SoCal and new teacher pay typically starts around $65k with a masters and credits. Additionally, it takes ten years of steps to break $100k; which is still not enough to live comfortably in the HCOL area my school is in so I have to commute. \nFor perspective, most homes in the area are selling between 1-1.5million. \n\nThe qualifications to get me the job include: a 4 year bachelors degree, a two year credential program, a two year masters degree, 6 months of unpaid student teaching, passing the sets of CBEST exams, the CSET exams, RICA exam, and CalTPAs. Also applicants must have a very clean criminal record (I shoplifted a hat when I was *16* and the CTC initially rejected my credential. It took almost 6 months of appeals to get it through). \n\nAll in all I spent over 8 years and *tens of thousands* of dollars to work in a career field in which I will never be able to afford a home and the general public respects less and less. \n\nIf I want to claim 100% of my pension I need an insane *40* years of service! My benefits are slowly becoming more expensive as the union negotiates away pieces of the benefits package year after year, trading for COL raises that don\u2019t nearly match inflation. \n\nAt least there is job security, right? Nope. One of my nearby districts just laid off over 100 teachers. \n\nTo make things worse, my working conditions become exponentially worse every year as the special education field continues to devolve into a litigious nightmare and administration gets weaker and weaker.\n\nI don\u2019t know why any sane person would choose this career field.",
            "I didn\u2019t quit working in public school because of pay.  I quit because of the dogshit conditions I was expected to endure, the abuse I was expected to just suffer in silence, and not being able to stomach the blatant antisemitism and bigotry that I witnessed on a daily basis.",
            "There's an old saying to the effect that if you can solve a problem by throwing money at it, it's not that much of a problem.\n\nEducation in the United States is like that.  The Senators won't hear it,,,,I mean, imagine telling the voters in the district that one of the reasons there is a teacher shortage is because the parents (voters) have raised rude, misbehaved, unethical, and entitled children that few people want to work with?",
            "It\u2019s not JUST low pay. It\u2019s how we are treated, the workload and the expectations put upon us. We are blamed for all the problems with students/society.  They expect miracles from us, yet treat us like we are children, force curriculum and standards that we know will not improve student learning, and talk like we are lazy whiners because we get 2 months off. All of this coming from politicians that barely work a few months a year. Then, add low pay, and who the hell would want to do this job??",
            "We work under Prop 2.5, which states that a town can increase tax levies by no more than 2.5% in any given year without an general override granting the town permission to take more taxes. In order for municipal employees -- including teachers -- to see their pay even approach annual increases that professionals in the private sector can ask for, the people need to vote for those funds.\n\nSo long as the general population determines the funding of education, educators will remain a second class of citizen. Just run a comparison on the cars in the faculty parking lot vs the cars the student parking lot.",
            "Given that education is a federal interest but largely controlled at the state and local levels there is little the federal government can tangibly do about teacher pay. The federalist system creates a hodgepodge of fiefdoms - aka local school districts - and all are funded somewhat differently with different tax bases and a variety of GSA funding mechanisms from various states. The Senate will just spend money conducting hearings and probably publish a report like they did in the 1960s with the Kerner Report on Civil Disorders but it won't change the fundamental nature of the problem.",
            "Low pay, poor working conditions, and children who are not being parented \u2014 not being prepared for adulthood and taught responsibility and accountability. Everyone shits on boomers, but the last generations of parents seem to be checked out entirely. Of course, these are broad strokes, and there are wonderful families out there, but too many assume their kids will be okay without any effort to parent them.",
            "Considering that a good portion of the Senate would gladly do away with public education, this will just be proof to that portion that the steps being taken are bearing fruit.",
            "The cynical side of me is certain they\u2019re going to use the fact that we\u2019re citing low pay as a major problem with teaching as a career as a way to demonize us for \u201cbeing greedy\u201d and throw hundreds of millions into trying to replace us with something that doesn\u2019t require a salary or some other wild bullshit. \n\nThey know damn well that the low pay is a problem; they just don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass.",
            "I'll just come out and say it....the way we are treated should be a close #2. If I leave in the next few years it wouldn't be because of the pay. I'm tired of being treated like a fucking doormat by the people I'm supposed to be educating.\n\nAnd having to sit there and take the abuse.",
            "There is no teacher shortage. There is a pay and respect shortage.",
            "It\u2019s by no means the only thing, but it\u2019s also the first thing that should be addressed (and which would then make every other thing that needs to be addressed possible). Any politician who doesn\u2019t have a plan to significantly increase teacher salary/benefits does not have a serious plan to fix issues with public education. Which means that basically no US politician has a serious plan to fix issues with public education.",
            "I make over $110k, people here aren\u2019t quitting because of the pay. They are quitting because kids don\u2019t listen and are out of control and parents and admins allow all this shit.",

Then they have the audacity to be like, \"why oh why doesn't anyone want to be a teacher?!\"",
            "I feel like pay is one of the major factors, especially for recruiting new people to the profession. BUT for retention of teachers, I think pay is slightly less important than factors like workload/stress/burnout, respect, school culture, adequate leadership, etc.",

            "Small class sizes, make class sizes dependent on scores and the economic wealth, meaning low scores and poor area, bring the class size down to under 20. Right now, it shows that high performing schools always seem to be in wealthy areas and have small class sizes. If the poor got at least the advantage of small class sizes, then maybe scores and behavior would improve. Another, any charter school that opens must have smaller classes than the nearby public school. I have worked in two charter schools that were Title 1 and both went for large class sizes. \n\nBut hey, if we want to go for impossible, I want to have corporal punishment for parents. \u201cHey, little Johnny was a dipshit today and got found stealing. So c\u2019mon in parent and get that paddling you rightfully deserve\u201d",
            "There will not be improvements. Those that run these systems understand that parents choose schools based on reputation alone. That reputation is best managed through marketing and segregation. Teachers do not improve either of those things at all. Therefore increasing pay for teachers gives the people who run schools absolutely no benefit. \n\nThe only way to increase teacher pay in the short term is sustained, applied force to the decisionmakers. The only way that we can have a system that maintains high pay for teachers is for teachers to replace those decsionmakers with themselves so that teachers directly control the budget",

            "Do I think there are going to be changes? No. because they will quickly realize that they would need to drastically need to reallocate funding from other spaces, or Raise taxes (which rarely happens during election season, more or less a sure fire way to make sure you don't get re-elected).\n\nThere's a LOT of problems with the state of the economy - Low pay for educators is just one of the many. I have my guesses as to what MIGHT happen, but I just work in the tech industry, I'm by no means an expert in any of this.",
            "Low pay has been a thing for a very long time. It is a confluence of things, but I think a core thing is lack of autonomy: people want to do cool, creative activities with their kids. You had one wing of politics pushing No Child Left Behind in the early 2000s and all the fallout and permutations from that then you have another wing wanting to say it's impossible to fail a kid and when you go complain that they threw a desk at your head you're condescendingly asked if you've tried having a conversation with them. These two sides are united in stripping teachers, very much willing to work for kinda low pay, of any will to keep going.",

Teachers being blamed for everything is horse shit and I am tired of it.\u00a0\n\n\nI had an incident happen in my classroom where the kids specifically said they knew how to get away with it by hiding what they were doing under the table as I circled around the class. I still got in trouble even though they admitted to planning and doing some heavy petting without my knowing. I shit you not I got in trouble and was told to be more vigilant... motherfuckers want me to walk around staring at kids crotches under the table? Luckily after 10+ years of teaching I have never had an issue, but this enraged me and truly opened my eyes that teachers are fucked and will disappear as we know it within the next 50 years without drastic overhaul and changes.\n\n\nMore money is 1 thing, but the job itself fucking sucks due to the nonsense the politicians and districts put in place.\u00a0\n\n\nTeachers are punching bags and nothing more these days.",
            "As a non-teacher, I will say a good career should have at least two of three elements:\n\n1) Great pay.\n\n2) Great environment.\n\n3) Moral satisfaction.\n\nA doctor gets great pay and moral satisfaction but has a stressful environment. A wall street banker gets great pay, a slightly less stressful environment but no moral satisfaction. An oil engineer gets great pay but has no moral satisfaction and still works in a shitty environment.\n\nTeachers haven't had great pay ever. People became teachers to get the moral satisfaction and for the good environment (coworkers and kids). Now teachers get lower pay, shitty badly behaved and often violent kids with admin that also harasses teachers. And morally, as a teacher you can't even teach your kids anymore cause they pass high school without knowing how to read or write. Becoming a teacher now is willingly becoming complicit in a corrupt system that does not care about education but just wants kids to graduate regardless of their effort and skill level.

Those 15 years of teaching were full of incompetent and/or micro managing administration, poorly run district offices, and constant money struggles due to the low pay. \n\nIt's a job where you have to be on from the second the first bell rings until the last bell rings. When I started working in higher ed, I was and still am continually surprised at how easy it is by comparison. I'm still teaching, but in a supportive and trusting environment.

My mom's been a para for decades and she does tons of work for free for her district, which is why they love her.\n\nPay teachers better and give them more support from admin, and you'll see people coming back to the profession.",

Oftentimes it is to highlight something to promote a discussion and provide fodder for infotainment programming and political ads. The result of the entire investigation surrounding these hearings is to provide supporting evidence for policy change, as generating research can often be an expensive proposition. I suspect these hearings will end up being used in a lot of political ads this fall to support attacks on candidates who are opposed to raising teacher pay.",
            "I\u2019m not attempting to respond to you in a mean tone, but the answer to your last question is no.

            "For me, it was the pay.\n\nBefore I was a teacher, I was a social worker whose niche was bonding with disenfranchised or even violent kids.  Classroom management was never a challenge, including the time I taught high school in the fentanyl capital of Arizona. But, as the years went by, I\u2019d ask for a pay raise and get an incredulous \u201cno\u201d from the admin who had spent every day prior praising my results.  When I quit at the end of the year, my position was always posted for $3,000 or $5,000 more than I was making.  \n\nMy last school was probably the best environment I had experienced.  The students were happy, the teachers got along, and the school director (whose dad owned the \u201ceducational company\u201d that ran our charter and several others) acted like everybody\u2019s best buddy.  She never observed, she frequently did the \u201cpizza party\u201d thing to show us appreciation without actually paying us, and she was very transparent with the exotic vacations she enjoyed every single school break.\n\nHow is she so rich?  \n\nWell, I finally did the unspeakable and told her I\u2019d like a raise next year. I said the next closest charter school to ours pays $12,000 more, and the farthest from ours pays $20,000 more. She almost choked and said, \u201cThat\u2019s outrageous! No teacher in Arizona is making that!\u201d\n\nI sent her the screenshots.  She emailed me, \u201cLet me know if you\u2019re coming back next year.\u201d\n\nI declined returning, and she posted my position for $5,000 more than I was making.  \n\nI was making $42,000.

My kids don't behave because they don't know what behavior means. Mom has 3 kids with 3 baby daddies, student's dad is in jail, or in foster care, or mom is a former junkie etc. No amount of essential questions written on a white board are going to teach those kids what success looks like, and education's role in being a functioning person.

            "Knowing this as a teacher is sooooooooo big.  Knowing that you looked forward to coming to class and the class kept you going tells the teacher they did something right and it had a huge impact on a students life",
            "Hearing from you would be a career and perhaps even life highlight. I can\u2019t stress enough how meaningful this will be for both of you.",
            "One hundred percent. I've had students come back to see me and make amends as part of their 12 steps, students who reached out to tell me how much things I did I do not ever remember doing meant to them. They always seem to come at the most-needed times in this under-appreciated, underpaid profession. So don't hesitate to tell a teacher how much they meant to you. It might save them!",
            "Definitely reach out. Students make a positive difference in the lives of teachers too. Though it may not have been your intention, thank you for reminding all of us that our kids notice and respond way more than we realize.",
            "Absolutely!",
            "There is nothing my wife wants more (kindergarten teacher) than to know how her past students are doing. She literally talks about it all the time. I bet this would absolutely make your teacher happier than a pig in shite.",
            "As a teacher, absolutely! It will probably make her so happy. I\u2019ve recently had two former students tell me that my classroom was their safe space in high school. One also told me that I really helped him through a very hard part of his life. We love to hear about it if we helped you that much. It helps us keep doing this stressful job.",
            "Definitely! Not only will it make your former teacher\u2019s day/month/decade, it will reinforce to the teacher how important those little acts are for her current and future students. I had a student this year tell me I was the only teacher who asked if she was okay when she was going through a rough patch and how much that meant to her. It made me realize it\u2019s something I need to do for all my students even when I don\u2019t necessarily know what\u2019s going on outside of school.",
            "I got a note that said \"thanks for helping me with my anxiety\" from a student and I nearly sobbed on the spot. So yeah. If this were me I'd ride that feeling for years. It lets them know at least one person got something from them",
            "yes!!!! 100% yes. Teachers deal with a lot of crap but these moments remind us why we do what we do",
            "I had a teacher like yours before. Honestly she was what inspired me to be an educator. I was a depressed and suicidal final year kid with no emotional support from my parents. She was truly genuinely concerned about me and checked in everyday when i was at school.\n\nI sent her an email a while back thanking her and talked about how i am now, what Im doing now and how she inspired me so much. Even showed her photos of my Master's graduation because I told her once that I didnt think I'd live to see being 19. She was beaming in her reply and really proud of how far ive come.\n\nDefinitely do reach out, Im sure your teacher would feel really happy and proud that you're doing better.",
            "Yes, of course.  It is a huge benefit of the job.",
            "Yes!  Please do, let her know how you are doing now.  We love this stuff!",
            "Do it. It will validate what they did/are doing.",
            "People go into teaching because they truly want to make a difference in someone\u2019s life. Reach out!",
            "I bet that teacher truly cared about you. I also bet it is emotionally taxing for her to be a caring teacher. It'd be so validating and encouraging for her to know she's doing right and it's working. If you can, tell her.",
            "Yes!",
            "I had a student in the past that wrote me a thank you card for \u201chelping her through her tough times\u201d and it is one of my most cherished possessions. I would absolutely send the message!",
            "As a former teacher, YES, YES, YES!!!",
            "OMG, please tell her. She will be thrilled that she made a difference in your life!!!!",
            "Yes indeed! She would ABSOLUTELY love to hear from you. I\u2019m glad you are doing better. It takes a special person to go through that and to thank someone who helped them go through that!",
            "You most certainly should thank and why wouldn\u2019t it be appropriate? You just sending her a thank you and allowing her to follow up with you on what\u2019s been going on, nothing wrong with that!!",
            "\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf Do it! It\u2019ll be a nice surprise and will mean a lot to her.",
            "Yes absolutely! It will mean so much to her. I hope you\u2019re doing better these days\u2764\ufe0f",
            "Let's see...Yes or Hell yes...hmmm.  Gonna go with Hell Yes.",
            "Please, please reach out to that teacher! Who knows? You may save her life by doing so.",
            "I'm a teacher. Please try to reach out. We so rarely get verification that we actually helped our students. It can literally change your mindset for months and bring you so much joy to know how you actually helped a kid out.",
            "YES. Teaching can be so disheartening. Hearing from former students is a LIFE highlight.",
            "Yes!!! Please do!",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes!!!! I love having older students visit me! I will be on their team forever.",
            "yes.",
            "Yes. Those lovely people need to know they made a difference.",
            "Without a doubt yes.  Keep in contact with her. Things like this make teachers day.",
            "Please let me tell you that this past year I had a sweet girl ask to speak to me privately and tell me that I saved her life by simply asking her every day how she was doing and making sure she was doing her work as well as she could. If she wasn\u2019t, I checked on her and talked to her. I had this girls for three years in a row, and when she let me know at then end of her senior year that I was the one who helped her when she was so down, it absolutely made me realize that you never know who you could be helping and how. \n\nShe is an amazing young woman and I am so proud of her. Just the fact the I checked on her made her want to come to school, but anyone could have done that. Her telling me made me realize that I made a difference in her life, and I know that she\u2019s going to be someone amazing. Let your teacher know. This is why we do it - to lift you up and make you better.",
            "Absolutely! Retired teacher here and we never stop thinking about \u201cour kids!\u201d You would make her day!",
            "Yes. As a teacher, when I was in my own dark places, students telling me I saved them, saved *me* in return.",
            "Yes!  I bet she has been wondering about you.",
            "Yes! \nI had a professor who had a huge impact on me at community college. When I went on to university, I sent him a letter to let him know just how important he had been. \n\nAbout a year later, he died. I'm so glad I got to tell him what he meant to me before he passed.",
            "It will make both of you feel incredible.  Do it right away- and keep us posted!",
            "Please, please find them and reach out.\n\nI grew up when there was no internet. There were several teachers that helped me be who I am today.\n\nSadly, I was only able to contact 2 of 4 teachers. They greatly appreciated me finding them. The one teacher who saved my life, died before I could find him.",
            "Yes, please do it!\n\nOne of the best moments of my day is walking into my local 7-11 where the manager is a formed HS student of mine who came into my classroom her junior year and told me, while I was teaching a full class of out of control seniors, that she was going to kill herself if she didn't get out of the IB program. I told the class to find Jesus, yelled at the teacher across the hall, and refused to leave my suicidal baby until she was seated with a guidance counselor and willing to talk.\n\nFrequently, she tells the whole store, \"This is the one woman I knew would take me seriously and save my life, so I went to her.\" It makes my day every time because I would have done it for any of my students, but that one student remembers. \n\nMakes the bad days easier to swallow.",
            ">Do you think it is appropriate to reach out to thank her and tell her what I\u2019ve told you here?\n\nNot only is it appropriate, I think it would be inappropriate for you _not_ to e-mail her.  If she was asking you frequently how you were doing, it's probably because she had an inkling that you were going through some shit and was genuinely concerned.\n\nIf I had a student like that, and they went off and graduated and disappeared from my life, I would always be wondering what happened to them.  If they contacted me and let me know that they're doing great and I played a small part in that, I'd be elated.",
            "YOU SHOULD GO FOR IT. Teachers carry very heavy loads. We absorb a lot from our students whether we like it or not. Every single time a student expresses gratitude and appreciation, the world lights up. It's not that we expect or hope for our students to thank us, but when it happens, you will also feel the strong emotions.",
            "Studies have shown that teaching is one of the least satisfying professions. \n\nWhen teachers find out their former students have grown into great adults, the satisfaction of the job goes up immensely. I cannot suggest enough that you should let them know that this person helped you. You might be helping them in doing so.",
            "As a teacher we sometimes never know the impact we have on our kiddos. Telling your former teacher this would be an amazing gift.",
            "She thinks of you occasionally and I am sure hearing from you would make her smile.",
            "I just started in teaching but can definitely tell you most teachers genuinely care alot about students, even the difficult ones, even the quiet ones. I also had a really tough time in HS & make a point of checking in on the ones that seem most sad, angry or anxious, like i was. I'd love to have one check in & just let me know they're OK.\nWho knows, you may save her life too. Haven't felt it yet, but from my observations teacher burnout is very real.",
            "Absolutely! You never know... You telling her all of this could be the thing that helps her get through something in her life. For instance, because of the broken education systems, lack of respect and parenting nowadays, and a myriad of other issues, a lot of teachers are leaving the field or thinking about leaving the field. Maybe you telling her this ends up being the one thing that makes her feel appreciated and like she is actually making a difference.",
            "Yes. Reach out. Tell her this. Chances are it will make her smile.",
            "Yes!! She would love to hear that you are doing well. Whether or not you tell her she may have saved you, she would love to hear that you're still here and still thinking about her. She'll love to hear that her class was your safe place.",
            "Absolutely appropriate and speaking as a teacher who struggles with depression myself and the overall sense of not feeling valued in our profession\u2026 she may just need to hear that from you. You in turn may just help her and return the favor. My first teaching job, the environment was so horrible that ended up I inpatient mental health care for a month. Please reach out\u2026 let her know what she meant, you never know what day she might have had and desperately she may need to hear it that day. It is thoughtful of you to think of her.",
            "Okay so I have a teacher who really changed my life, transformed my confidence and indirectly contributed to my career in writing. Always wanted to reach out to her, but it\u2019s been 12 years and I\u2019ve hesitated. These comments have made change my mind. Going to message her today \u2764\ufe0f",
            "I've taught for 15 years and I was told something similar many years ago.\n\nIt sticks with me still. It's one reason I continue to teach. That we teachers can have such an impact outside of our content is profound. Please tell her.",
            "Thank you \u2764\ufe0f I\u2019m starting to write the message I want to send her",
            "She definetly had huge impact on my life. I\u2019m really grateful for teachers like her",
            "Same here. I totally agree.",
            "Happy cake day :)",
            "I am doing much better now \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Yeah I\u2019m sure she knew I was not ok and I could tell she wasn\u2019t buying it when I told her I was fine. She could\u2019ve easily given up on asking but she never did and that made a huge difference for me. I\u2019ll write to her and make sure to let her know that"
