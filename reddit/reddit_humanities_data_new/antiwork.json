Here\u2019s an interesting snippet from the article \n\n\n*While Queen Elizabeth is mainly a legal figurehead in Canada, the vast majority of Crown Land in Canada is owned by the Crown as an institution. About half of the land is administered by the provincial governments and the rest by the federal government.*\n\n*So does her death mean anything for these lands?*\n\n*\u201cThe Crown land is public land, so it\u2019s not the Queen personally,\u201d says Dale Smith, a journalist and author of The Unbroken Machine: Canada\u2019s Democracy in Action.*\n\n*\u201cWho owns the Crown itself as an institution holds it. And therefore, there\u2019s complete continuity with the Crown now, being under Charles,\u201d added Smith.*\n\n*In other words, the Crown lands will now fall under Charles\u2019 jurisdiction due to the Queen\u2019s death.*\n\nBut in the spirit of fairness, source me something tangible that pegs their net worth at more than $28 billion. Cause if you were to count all the lands held by the british crown as personal property, they would be far far far away the richest people in the world. Going into the trillions. But nobody ever mentions it as such.",

Basically if you have a skin problem that's exacerbated by shaving, then your employer must deal with your medical costs associated  with shaving which includes cost of razors because usually cheap bics are not enough. Again the job thought it would be easier to unify the dress code by making it equally restrictive. Less than a week later us attendants were allowed to grow out beards, but we were told that we would have to take time off to grow out beard out to a presentable level, which again is illegal and I had to put them in their place.\n\n...yeah I was not liked by managment at that job, but I was loved by the hourly workers... the guys more than the girls.

            "Minimum wage in the US isn't 12.50/hr. I'm sure where minimum wage is that high they probably do make close to that though, I wouldn't know. All locals are different. But yes, there are benefits and holidays and shit. I am personally not full time, but it doesn't seem.partocularly hard to become full time",
            "More then double is just 14.50 or higher, where'd you get 25/hr?",
            "Minimum wage in Denver is $18.29 so I'm pretty sure it is pretty easy to make $25 at a grocery store.  I see signs at McDonald's that they are hiring at $21.",
            "Mine need replacing because they\u2019re foam and thin running shoe fabric (great shoes, they\u2019re practically custom made. Even for the fact that they\u2019re foam, I\u2019ve worn them 5-15 hours a day for 18 months and walked 20-50,000 steps per day in them and they\u2019re barely getting holes where my toes hyper extend and stretch the fabric weirdly. \n\n$200. For 20 months of wear that\u2019s 10$ a month for Fantastic shoes. Then there\u2019s my fianc\u00e9 with his $350 boots that come with extraordinarily inexpensive manufacturer repair/upkeep that quite literally could be passed to our future child someday. Good ass boots. \n\nMy grandma always told me her daddy said you pay extra for the things that separate you from the ground. Shoes, tires, and mattresses (in that order). A really good pair of $200 shoes or boots will last ages. A good set of $1200 all weather tires will last ages and keep you extra safe on the road. A good $3000 mattress will relax the back pain your job causes.\n\nThough back when he said that, 3k on a mattress was probably unimaginably expensive but I adjusted for inflation",

            "Clean shaven is a bit extreme but the only place I could think of that would be within reason to request nearly trimmed beards would be food service. That or wearing a beard net for cooking over a stove. For a retail setting there\u2019s no reason unless it\u2019s some extremely up scale place.",

            "The cultural differences between companies is always hilarious to me.  When I started my career I had been given advice from recruiters that I could never possibly be overdressed for an interview, so I'd always be in full suit and tie.  This was for jobs in like tech support, field service tech, etc. btw.  I remember I interviewed for Harley Davidson Dealer Systems (company that made software for and supported a lot of the Harley dealers).  I was full suit and tie, while they were in jeans and graphic tees.  I took off my blazer and tie and they all let out a sigh of relief and told me how glad they were that I didn't keep it on lol.",

            "Agree. This is why it has catholic school energy. IMO gendered dress codes should be illegal for a workplace. It's discrimination. I remember those boys in catholic high school sweating in their ties. Yikes.",
            "My secondary school (in Germany) had a really funny thing where it went through first a short list of things no-one can wear, then a whole list of things girls aren't allowed to wear and then clearly someone at the meeting went \"well I guess we should forbid *something* for the boys or people will say this looks sexist\" so they forbade... \"muscle shirts\", and muscle shirts only.",
            "I worked at Publix in the late 90s and it wasn\u2019t this strict. We could wear solid colored tennis shoes and whatever nail polish we wanted.",
            "Those restrictions are in regards to nail length and color. Nothing is stated anywhere in that picture about acrylics, which are commonly prohibited in areas where food prep is being done in several establishments. And unless this is a \"mom and pop\" establishment(highly doubtful considering the dress code), that means this place has meat processing, possibly a bakery, and a deli, where foods are commonly prepared.",
            "oooh, that's a very good point. And the US definitely cares more about freedom of religion than sexism. Maybe this could be used to get government pressure on them?",

            "We did, I am saying this document is discriminatory, and then describing the actual law of food safety vs. this sexist document.",
            "Yes. The sexist document in the OP says that. I am, however, describing actual food safety law versus this company policy.",
            "No looking at it again, I'm pretty sure only the company provided stuff (I'm assuming probably a company shirt) is considered \"uniform\" and the rest is just dress code, meaning that when they say the uniform must be removed on breaks and after work, they really mean the company shirt, and honestly I don't mind that too much, as it means that unless someone recognizes you as staff, no one can identify you as staff when you're break",
            "I'm glad you're at least getting paid pretty well.",

            "That's truly insane to me. In Ontario, one of the biggest grocery store chains max out at truly a couple dollars - at most - above the minimum wage. Which is $15 too low for cost of living.",

            "Firefighters can only have a mustache and must be clean shaven on the rest of their face. This is so that their masks can create a seal on their face. Only exception is for religious reasons and even then I believe it has to be trimmed to a certain length.",
            "Having a beard doesn't prevent someone from being a firefighter, obviously. The guy driving the fire truck is STILL a firefighter. But a fucking grocery store that says \"shave the beard or no job\" is absolute control freak bullshit. I've seen lots of bearded cooks and bakers and when hair is an issue, I see them wearing the beard hair net. If cleanliness is an issue, obviously the tech exists to mitigate the risk...unless the owners of this particular horrible business don't want to spend the cash to ensure that all employees have access to the proper gear. And if that is the case, they are mostly likely shaving costs elsewhere as well, so call OSHA and the health department, they need a real thorough inspection.\n\nNo doubt they demand all of this and pay the absolute lowest wage allowed wherever this particular shithole is located.",
            "How I handle it now is to wear a shirt with a collar, my assumption is that it shows I\u2019m making a bit of effort to look a little better. I still don\u2019t own a tie, and won\u2019t dress better than that. That shirt with a collar for a few interviews this last round was a Hawaiian shirt with a Star Wars theme",

Not sure how I'd go about it at this point.  I came out and started transitioning since then so I feel like I have a lot more clothing options to play with than before.",
