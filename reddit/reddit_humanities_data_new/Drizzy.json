            "I agree with you 100%. \n\nTo me this whole beef is indicative of a larger societal problem. \n\nFirst you have the age old idea of tearing people down to build them back up. People absolutely love the underdog story. When you get too big, you\u2019re no longer relatable in that way and so the envy and jealousy makes you resented. But after you get torn down, you can be an underdog again and people build you back up. It\u2019s just ironic that people are really rooting for millionaire, critically acclaimed Kenny. But he\u2019s behind Drake. \n\nPeople forget, as much as Michael Jordan is a legend, people hated him and called him overrated while he was winning. They do the same thing to LeBron now. Then in 10 years the same people will be telling their kids \u201cman, I was so lucky to get to watch LeBron.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also part of the social media age where algorithms cause these positive/negative feedback loops. Opinions become narratives which become \u201cfacts.\u201d It\u2019s kinda depressing. \n\nThank you for coming to my Ted talk.",

His own lines going to come back and haunt him. \nEspecially that \"got a weird case Why's he around ' \" predator move in flocks' lines. Lol his own song will be used against him. \n\nAll this fake outrage they got painting Drake as a PDF. But they don't care about Travis scott who was 23 dating Rubi when she was 17. They don't care about TDE affiliates DV cases. Mustard was playing TYGA.  Dr dre got like 4 different DV incidents. Including his recent ex wife. But guess what? The hatred got people blinded right now. Soon they'll realize the hypocrisy. \n\nAlso the fact they labelling kendrick the king of rap, while Drake been putting in 15 years dropping every single year being active , put on so many artists then anybody. While kendrick disappears every 5 years. That's a slap in the face.\n\nAnd 6 months from now they'll all say how Drake the Goat again",

            "Yeah, everyone is a snake. Drake's never done anything wrong but people keep turning on him. That's life I guess \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff. That's what happens when you try to be a good guy.",

            "Facts. I'm listing down everyone caught on video singing to that shit and making their lives as bad as I can from behind the scenes (rdit: if I'm drake obviously lol). People say Drake is moving on, but like dawg, if that was me it's on for life. I could never rap at you again but best believe I'll be actively leveraging against you at every step in your career going forward.",

            "I don\u2019t think I\u2019d personally consider those betrayals in the same way as the dudes dissing him directly. To me, there\u2019s a lot of credit to the idea that that concert was more of a west coast unity thing for a lot of people. \n\nI mean snoop called Kendrick King of the West after the concert, and he clearly wasn\u2019t upset by Taylor Made.",
            "I don't think being on that stage means you're offended by Taylor made freestyle or even Drake specifically, but whatever",
            "That's cool between you and me. But look at some of these comments and my downvotes.\n\nPeople really think that being on that stage was a betrayal.\n\nCheck out these tough guys in the comments. I mean \"its on for life\" and \"gotta pick a side.\" Seems like some folks took it kinda personal.",
            "you and I might be the only ones in this thread that think that then",
            "I mean the fans are different from the people involved. I think it\u2019s reasonable for some fans (Stans, maybe) to feel a certain type of way when they\u2019re looking for any Drake support and see dudes like YG with Kendrick after being shouted out by Drake. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think that means YG felt some type of way about Taylor Made, and more that this is the biggest moment the west coast has had in over a decade. \n\nAnd if they all did feel some type of way about it, I agree with the other dude. That\u2019s pretty soft."
