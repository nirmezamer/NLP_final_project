The swift step nerf is gunna fuck with my muscle memory for awhile, and I will def die more because of the extra second, but I don't think it's that bad either.\n\nI will say that it's funny to me how everyone is focused on the suzu nerf when the swift step nerf is a much bigger deal.  I'm in situations probably around once per game where I'm where I'm holding shift with ~50 hp, just barely surviving when it comes off cd in time.  If all of those situations turn into deaths now, it's gunna be a rough time.  Will have to play less aggressively, which also sucks because playing aggressive on her is what makes her so fun.

His platform is too niche to really consider as a utility and whilst his life grip is handy, it's nowhere near as handy as say a discord orb or a ressurection.

The scary thing about the Mercy leash is the blue beam, not the yellow one: if there's a yellow beam shoved up Pharah's jetpack then you can absolutely out-damage Mercy's heals, the problem is the blue beam because what you may have trouble doing is out-damaging Pharah's boosted damage\n\nThe problem is that healbotted heroes are perfectly killable, but they still require so much extra effort to take down; it isn't exactly impossible to eliminate a yellow leash Orisa, it just isn't fun\n\nIt's way harder, however, to eliminate an Orisa being healbotted by Ana or Bap",

I've been memetricking reaper this season and his teleport is an extremely vaulable and underrated part of his kit, but It fs needs a lil love/ quality of life.\n\nAnother issue has to do with either Reaper's cooldown dependency, cooldown cycling, or his range. It feels like he has these long pauses of limited value because of his limited range and long slow cooldowns in comparison to other heroes. On one hand, this should be the case, because of how deadly and consistent he is up close; on the other hand, he just feels \"movement-crept\" by all the reworked and new heroes and sometimes struggles to close the gap in the faster pace of OW2. \n\nI think the health and armor changes really highlighted this issue because he no longer gets the same value from tank busting (overall good change imo). However, he needs compensation for that loss.",

Even when her auto aim heals were low which might've been considered a trade off they buffed it. I almost never see a game without her in it. Her last \"nerf\" was adding more heal with less invulnerable time which in terms of actually playing was a net buff. Even just this last week I've seen a hog go from 100-full after Suzu bailed him out cause you can't interact with invulnerable targets but you can still heal them for some reason. She literally has no weaknesses and makes the game so dull to play. She's just poorly designed and to make her fair she needs more obvious weaknesses cause she's not hard to play and provides so much value. Every pro and top player I've seen hate her and don't even like playing her but every game it's like mandatory. I'm so over 2 years of kiriko at this point so yeah they baby her.",

            "Lol I'm not hating! Even if she shuts down my favorite hero (Ana) pretty well. I'd rather Dva be good than, say, Hog or Mauga because her kit is definitely skill intensive and I think she has a really sweet balance between a Tank tank and a DPS tank, if you will.",

I mean you have some valid points and then just start grinding an axe because you personally don\u2019t like Kiri. Also her pick rate is not much different than the other on main healers I thought. Hog going full health is his ability, Suzu just gives it time to proc uncontested. Is that good? Idk, I don\u2019t like it, but again, Ana. Oh yeah speaking of, if we\u2019re complaining based on rate ._. Oops \n\nI don\u2019t think they baby her more than the other picky mains (eg mercy). I think she\u2019s like every other hero blizz doesn\u2019t know what to do with. Her kit is set, and she\u2019d need major reworks to placate desires like yours I think. Just tweaking her current kit will never \u201cfix\u201d what I think people find wrong with her. And blizz is super great and quick about reworks, as we know!\n\nEdit: it\u2019s like trying to fix widows one-shots. If you get rid of them without doing anything else, she\u2019s entirely utterly useless. There\u2019d be almost no reason to pick over ash other than the scope. I guess what I\u2019m saying is I\u2019d rather they fix her than keep doing -what I find to be- pointless bandaid updates. Like in all honesty, other than a minor rein buff I don\u2019t see this nerf affecting Suzu in any meaningful way. Maybe that\u2019s your point? In which case, kinda sure",

            "widow is oppressive in the right hands and maps and boring but she has very obvious strengths and weaknesses at the very least (still problematic in 5v5 though). kiriko is like lifeweaver in that it takes away player choice in the game and games are about the illusion of choice. kiriko also works in literally every team comp. kiriko and lifeweaver have choices they can make that limit the choices other players can make in terms of counterplay. before positioning used to matter more, someone making the mistake of stepping out of position could be punished for it but with a kiriko on the team she could instantly tp through a wall to save someone with a suzu so now you're on a hero that had to make a choice to take a risky play to get someone who was out of position but she sees that and it's a 2v1 now. you took a risk and kiri didn't take one at all and her whole kit is like 3 get out of jail free cards with short cd's. or you dive a kiriko out of position but she just tp's to safety and even with highly mobile heroes she's hard to chase down cause her tp is always to a teammate so she's never alone. suzu is easy to use and provides so much value that it's only used to deny and it's on a short cooldown it's arguably the strongest ability in the game next to lamp. it immediately counters almost everything so you essentially need to create two openings just to be able to actually push. in the hands of someone playing kiri they probably think it's fine because they have choice and options but on the other side what is the actual counterplay to her kit? how do I as a player outplay someone playing her? i think those are the questions I want players to ask most. \n\nfor instance, lets look at Ana who is the best support ever created. she's fun to play, high skill expression, multidimensional choice. Ana you could position aggressively to make offensive plays with antinade and sleep. you put yourself at risk but could make a play to push and win. you could play defensively and toss abilities when needed or when you see someone out of position. you could hold them in case there are flankers. and on the opposite side I could choose to try and duel ana with her abilities and take a risk myself or I could wait till she uses them offensively to create an opening. there are options for her and for me playing against her but also room for error on both sides. there are also ways people have gotten super creative with her kit like throwing nades straight up as they fall 6 seconds later in perfect spots over things. that is an amazingly well designed ability because those creative things are skill expression by players. those options don't exist with kiriko. her heals auto aim so there's no room for error. suzu is 99% defensive denial and it's just tossed at the ground. her kunai are essentially just spam. and her tp is powerful but also limited. her kit is just bad in comparison to someone like ana. the only way to make her kit work is to keep the value at these abilities high because there is little to no skill expression in her kit in comparison to someone like ana. if a person dies to ana they usually feel like they deserved it, I know I do so it doesn't feel unfair even if I saw her every game. if someone dies to kiriko it's just frustrating because she never had the same risks you did and that is why it's not that I just don't like her, it's that she's not a healthy addition to the game.",
            "i\u2019m not master like you, only Diamond so I guess ymmv",
            "I have zero issues with the changes, they are totally fair. Just find it wild to call it a 'hard' nerf, lmao",
            "It doesn't disable the barrier at least, and the damage is quite low so I can't see it doing much for Cass there apart from slowing your critical hp retreating\n\nI like to see the shield flick return tho that's fun",
            "Kinda not really though. The only way to shut down someone for that long would be with something like a Grav, a Shatter or even the knockback from Whole Hog.\n\nIf you punch, hook or javelin let's say a Genji using ult, it doesn't waste his entire ult like if you slept him.",
            "I agree, but that's not the usual feedback people have about him.  Basically since day one people have been begging to remove the weapon switch mechanic and just have left click heal and right click attack, but like... you can literally play any other support if you want to quickly change between healing and damage.",
            "I don\u2019t know why people are downvoting you, because in lower elo, I WILL top frag as Hanzo, but then again low elo players have bad positioning and awareness\n\nAlthough full disclosure I was tempted to downvote you because of your pfp had me wiping my phone like a loon \ud83d\ude02\n\nEdit: take an upvote to even it out,\nAlso in matches where there are equal mechanics, he does get outperformed by a lot of other heroes now"

            "Nah, I like the skins, and battlepass is well worth a cheap $10, even if it's not chock full of my favorite skins. I'll get the battle pass every single season, as there's no reason for me not to, as someone who enjoys in-game skins",
            "60 Prisms? Where\u2019d you find that?\n\nBut yeah, I\u2019d expect it\u2019d to be something like 30 unlock, 10 to upgrade, 10 to upgrade again or something. But 50 just to get?!",
            "You can't get 2 mythical in a BP",
            "Was there ever any doubt?",
            "Nothing ruined yet though\n\nTechnically, having the option to choose is an improvement over last season, e.g.\n\nBy getting the BP, you obtain a Mythic for sure, as you did before. Now you can choose between Mythics across seasons and a weapon skin so far. \n\nSo where is the 'ruining' part? In your sense of entitlement?",
            "How did they ruin it? They are not forcing you to get anything",
            "I did know this and posted it on Reddit as soon as the currency was added.",

            "That Christmas Bastion skin everyone complains about was a nice price",
            "How? A mythic skin costs more than a whole game my guy, in what way is it fine? Because it's optional? Absolutely asinine",
            "Them charging for stuff is fine. As you say it's a free game and they need to make money.\n\n\nThe issue is that it's not free out of the goodness of their hearts. No, it's free because these extremely overpriced cosmetic items generate more money than a full priced game.\n\n\nThey should be charging to make money, but they're charging specifically to maximize the money as much as possible, even beyond reason.",
            "Because you can't get both without spending a very large amount of money to buy prisms. In a single season there will be a mythic skin and a mythic weapon and you can only get one, if you want both you have to spend a ton. Battlepass only gives enough for one.\n\nYou also sound far angrier than anyone here.",
            "The issue isn\u2019t that, the issue is that both the weapon and skin cost 80 prisms for a total of 160. In case you can\u2019t count we only get 80 from the battlepass, so we can\u2019t get both unless we pay an absurd amount",
            "You sound like a miserable person",
            "It's whale bait.\n\nPeople with more money than you or I view money differently. Simply put, \"my time is more valuable than my money\" so they spend rather than wait. \n\nSadly, there is no systematic way to stop poor people from becoming tempted into wasted their money on this kinda luxury too, and corporations don't give a shit about exploiting them.",

            "Thing is, mythics are one of the few things I\u2019d actually spend money on - and getting the battle pass is the cheapest way of accumulating the currency",

            "I don't get how it's ruined either, I don't play 8/11 characters with a Mythic skin an i'd much rather save prisms or buy a great looking weapon for a Tank I do play instead of having a mythic skin I'll never use. It'll be better for people long term when they can choose not to buy a mythic skin for a hero they don't use and save those prisms for something else.",
            "Because before you were 100% able to get all Mythic skins before by just getting the battle pass. Now you have to dig into the wallet.",
            "In the past seasons, mythic skins cost $10. The only way to get them was BP. When they introduced the mythic shop it was the heavy chuckling in meet the medic gif, cuz now 80 prisms is like 100 bucks so mythic skins shot way up in price. \n\nI don't think it's entitlement to *want* to support the game. I'd happily pay $5, $10 for a legendary skin, maybe $25 max for a mythic skin/weapon. Setting the precedent that you only get one mythic's worth of currency a season (and if you want everything they introduce, cuz remember it's FOMO and gone for a long time once the season is over) makes it easier and easier for them to price gouge and charge even more ridiculous prices.",
            "Stop being stupid\n\n\nNobody is entitled that's complaining about the endless process gouging. Because that's what it is, it's price gouging.\n\n\nYou're actually stupid to be mad at people that are mad at the problem.",
            "Previously if you didn't play the seasonal mythic character, well too bad. Now at least you've got 2 options and you can choose which one you like more. This is a good thing. \n\nMadness that there are people who'd prefer only having one choice and are complaining about this change. Yeah no thanks.",
            "I actually think that the weapons would be \"good\" only for people who have every Mythic either possible or that they personally wanted and runs into a \"bad\" new Mythic that they don't care for. If the weapon is more to their liking, then you can use the Prisms towards that instead. Rather than simply banking Prisms or buying something you'd rather not have, then opting for the weapons instead would just give more options than only past Mythics. Again, for people not in this position, it's definitely not better. But for some...I see it being just something that they could be OK with.",
            "You aren't *supposed* to get both, jesus christ lol.\n\nThey're giving options and you can choose what you want. Some people never play certain roles or heroes. \n\nMore options are good, meanwhile some people just want *everything*, and immediately too. Yeah that's not how it works.",
            "Don't careeeeeeeeeeeeee",
            "But you have an unlimited amount of time to collect prisms. Just by the seasons you like, you'll get them all eventually. \n\nIt makes them more satisfying to get anyways, and are you really a fan of every single mythic? I know I'm not, there are only a few I like.",
            "Each pass gives you at least 500 coins when completed, means the you only need 5 dollars to buy the next one",
            "That sound like what happen with OW1.",
            "What game has that ever worked in?",
            "That's too good to be true. They'd rather scrap the project than making more consumer-friendly decisions.\n\nCompany makes a good game but barely breaks even? Close the studio.\n\nPlayers like the game but it doesn't generate enough revenue? Not profitable, cease development and service.",
            "Of course if you quell it, something else with better monetization will pop up but it will NOT be Overwatch.\n\nAlso you're speaking as if OW2's monetization is bad. It's way better than OW1 where the only option to spend is on Loot Boxes (other than the base game).",
            "Which part of my comment did I defend Blizzard?",
            "You\u2019re joking, right?\n\nJUST THE HAMMER costs like \u00a330 and I don\u2019t get to send people to Hell unless I cough up another \u00a310?",
            "The problem is people are still obsessed with getting everything the microtransaction system is meant for you to pick which things you like not get everything available, as someone who buy the BP every season having options is great incase a skin sucks or I don't like it. Them making more options is always good.",
            "If you aren't supposed to then they shouldn't even offer the option to get both\n\n\nIf they are gonna offer the option, then it should be reasonably priced.\n\n\nWe got neither, it's essentially not an option to get both if you have even an ounce of self respect. Meanwhile, they get undeserved cash flow from the fools that do bite the bait.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's grimy and a pathetic state this industry is finding itself in.",
            "It\u2019s more having a stockpile of prisms for when they release stuff you want, for example this BP - the two mythics are both good, but you would have to either spend real money or grind multiple passes to pay for it. \n\nYes it\u2019s a bullshit system, and it\u2019s been designed this way on purpose. That being said OW is the main game I play and I want it to be profitable, so I don\u2019t mind spending $15 every 2 months.",
            "I don't know when I'll want them, and there's some past skins I want to (at least one, the Kiriko mythic)",
            "Oh yeah, I forgot that! Unfortunately, I'm not frugal enough to avoid spending those coins on whatever exclusive events drop each season \ud83d\ude2d",
            "Then keep doing nothing and give them money, that will surely help more right? Don't come complaining when games will be so filled with micro transactions they become unplayable though",
            "Then let it die. What is happening here is players showing how much they're happy to give them loads of money. Remember when OW1 had just loot boxes and took a shit storm from many players ? Today it's even worse and it seems players are ok with this.",
            "Then let it fucking die. If you want companies to be more consumer friendly it sure won't help keeping the money coming to their pockets. If you as a customer don't like how they operate but still keep giving them money they will keep doing that. If you don't give them money maybe something changes.",

            "*Another way to spend your Mythic prisms, you can unlock the base skin at 50 Mythic Prisms, and then unlock additional levels at 10 Mythic Prisms including a Weapon Flourish emote, elimination visual effects, and reactive effects.*\n \n\n  This is their words",
            "Welcome to 2024 free to play games",
            "No. \u00a0The microtransaction system is meant to extract money from you. For 10 seasons they have trained consumers that they get everything Mythic from just the battle pass. Now they pivoted to get more money.\u00a0",
            "More options is good. Locking those options behind incredible pay walls is bad.\n\n\nThe microtransaction system is not designed to make you pick and choose. It's designed to make you spend as much as possible. It's cancer, and you are too for even thinking about defending it.",
            "You should consider Microsoft rewards. You get 600 coins from the pass, meaning you only need 400 more for the pass, which comes out at 3600 points. When you get to lvl 2 in Microsoft rewards you can get 200 points a day",
            "I started complaining about micro transactions in 2015. It's been a losing battle. Most kids are happy to pay 20$ for skins. It's normal to them. Every game with micros has whales. They only need a few 1000 people willing to pay for everything in the game every second there's something they don't have and the game can stay with it's current model.",
