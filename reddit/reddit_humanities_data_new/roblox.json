There's no safezone or shops you just go around the facility and loot for weapons, healing items, armour, ... That was quite literally all there is to the game, you run around loot for weapons and start fighting furries or turn into one and fight humans. I remember it being quite good mechanic-wise with camera bobbing, animation, UI, ... The most distinctive aspects of the map was that there's an open area that reveals heavy blizzard in the outside world, a large cave system with crystals (that probably turns you into furries), and a trash can that looks like among us. So far the closest game I can find to this is Transfur Outbreak. I also distinctly remember that the furries have an item/ability called assimilate which instead of dealing damage, infects people on the spot with success depending on the victim's health?",

            "Over the past couple weeks, I've had to reset my password multiple times. I thought maybe I had been hacked, but nothing else had changed, so I thought nothing of it. About 2 days ago, I bought $5 worth of Robux (400) so I could buy a gamepass in Bloxburg. The gamepass costed 200 Robux, leaving me with around 250 Robux leftover. I logged in today and to my surprise, I had 0 Robux left. On top of that, a game called \"PLS DONATE\" randomly appeared in my continue playing list of games. I know for a fact I haven't played that game in months, so someone else had to be using my account. I have never shared my password with\u00a0**anyone**, not even close friends or family who also play Roblox. \"PLS DONATE\" is a game where players can donate Robux to other players, so I'm very worried that I've been hacked and scammed. I'm guessing that whoever did this had joined \"PLS DONATE\" on my account as well as on their personal account on anther device so that they could donate/steal my remaining Robux onto their personal account. If anyone else has experienced this or has another explanation, please respond. Thanks in advance.",

Been grinding on this game for about a week now, super addictive!\n\nYou start with a plot of land and a tiny store. You can work with that store or completely knock it down and design your dream retail space from scratch.\n\nYou place shelves and display areas to stock various products like food, produce, furniture, electronics, etc. You get to hire staff like cashiers, managers, restockers, etc. who help keep your store running.  \n\nThe goal is basically to keep customers coming in, to gain as much money as possible and make your retail empire grow!",
            "had 3.2m robux taken\n\nSooo, I traded 4 items for 2 items, apparently they were \u2018taken from a compromised account\u2019, and roblox took those two items from me. I contacted support, waited 3 days, and was finally just told to kick rocks, they \u2018reviewed my account thoroughly\u2019 and the items were a violation of TOS. However, they acknowledged I had no idea they were stolen, the UAIDs were clean, and said no action will be taken against me. So, from what I see, I lost everything, the guy I traded has all my shit still, the items I lost are magically gone, and support told me to fuck off and not to appeal a second time. Any advice?",

The only time you would have to pay is if you want a lot of alternative-art cards, which are only cosmetic differences anyways.",

All the people saying the game has a good message are correct. But keep in mind, all the game really says is that it loves you and that life is hard, but it gets better which is as basic as it gets. Think about it, how many times have you heard someone say it gets better. People are apparently crying because of how good the games message is and I won't critic your enjoyment of anything but my view on it is that the message is extremely basic and that anyone with basic knowledge of roblox studio could make a game just like Oobja within a few days.",
