For the designation I would usually go for industrial since I like having reduced upkeep for both metallurgists and artisans, but you can also take forge/factory world depending on which job you have more pops working. Even if you aren\u2019t struggling for alloys, more is always better so honestly a forge world would probably be best here. \nHaving said that, you have other options as well.\nBecause you have 26 city districts here, you could make the planet into a trade world, using either the urban or resort designations. Urban will give you more trade value but since resort world also gives you extra unity and alloys you to build resort districts, and because this world is an ocean world, you might be drawn to pick resort. Personally, I take resort worlds purely for role-play purposes if I\u2019m playing egalitarian, but either works. Max out those city districts and throw in some commercial zones and watch the energy creds flow. \nIf you don\u2019t want to make a trade hub, you could turn it into a tech world. Get as many building slots as you can through the city districts, slap down research labs and you\u2019re good to go. It doesn\u2019t really matter what you do with the remaining districts, but I would take some generator districts and farming districts to reduce the upkeep of the planet. If the planet has a feature that allows the construction of gas extraction wells (fuming bog, bubbling swamp), absolutely take advantage of it since upgrading those research labs brings an exotic gas upkeep requirement. \nThere are definitely more ways you can build this planet up, but I\u2019d say one of these three would be the best use of its districts, depending on what you need or want most.",

Those suckers require a LOT of minerals, and you can only buy around 42 minerals per month before the price starts skyrocketing to unreasonable levels, and that's only enough to finance like.. 3 or 4 industrial districts. Nowhere near enough if you need alloys AND cg. Of course you can offset that by selling excess consumer goods and food but it'll keep rising basically forever and eventually get to an unsustainable level. Is there some kind of trick to all this I don't know about? The easy answer is vassalization of course but that requires you to be a decent amount of years into the game, as well as having already financed a very large fleet, which then creates a chicken or the egg problem.

That doesn't really give much benefit from a ratio perspective (you need as much food for 1 alloy as you need minerals), but is profitable from a per buildung/per job basis, as the base alloy production (and food requirement) per job is 50% bigger. Also when paired with anglers you can almost get rid of minerals as well (as you have an easier way to get CG now). And trade can substitute energy credits (and also consumer goods and in turn minerals) but does require jobs except if you are a megacorp.\n\nEarly game you will still need worker jobs, not much going around that, but generally speaking the less worker jobs you can get away with, the more pops can work as the much more valuable specialists, so make sure you build your worlds in a way that favor specialists except for the absolute necessary worker ones. Probably people just don't make dedicated mining worlds but instead build worker districts as necessary and replace them at a later point once possible.\n\nArc furnaces are absolutely great as they not only can substitute minerals until you get matter decompressors (at which point you are set for nearly forever) but also give you alloys directly, which is dope. Early vassalizing neighbours also helps a lot, as setting them to give you basic resources is imho much more efficient than any other resource, as you can then just skip those worker jobs and that is what you should focus on late early to midgame as well.",

            "I mostly play modded, and one of the side-effects of my mods is that space resources are more common. That means I can rely on mining stations throughout much of the early and mid-game.\n\nFor vanilla, along with the obvious vassals and tributaries, you'll want to form individual trade deals rather than going to the market. Most regular AI empires will neglect consumer goods production, so if you set yourself to Civilian Economy and build a lot of industrial districts, you'll have plenty of surplus to sell to your allies. This also strengthens trust, which can help you form a federation. (You can probably tell I'm a xenophile/egalitarian main.)\n\nMake these individial deals when possible, and try to spread them out across multiple allies on different renewal timers. Don't be too reliant on one. I find it's worth doing this even if you end up paying more than you would on the galactic market. It might cost you a little more, but it builds trust, makes your allies dependant on you - which prevents backstabs and can eventually be leveraged into a vassal contract - and doesn't have the scaling problem you mentioned in the original post. Galactic market prices increase beyond 40 per month. Individual deals are steady.\n\nThe other advice I'll give for avoiding worker jobs: find a megacorp as early as you can and cozy up to them. They'll reduce your reliance on technicians a lot - though you might still want some clerks in order to benefit from their branch office trade value boost. In the early game, with a megacorp ally, I find that clerks are actually better than technicians in most circumstances. They reduce the number of entertainers you need on small or newly-settled worlds, freeing up your consumer goods for research and unity production. Pair a few clerks with some medical workers and a Merchant from a branch office, that will handle most of your amenities needs.",

            "Early game before vassals? Trade and space deposits, really.\n\nHere is one approach for a peaceful/diplomatic game that requires minimal or no miners in the early game after the first decade or so:\n\n* Scout quickly and extensively using corvettes to know where it is safe to expand and where not, discover where you can cut off the AI from clusters of empty systems\n* Scout further afield at the speed of first contact; i.e. if you have a free envoy or will soon have one, press the exploration to discover others to contact\n* Take Diplomacy and the Federation tradition no later than the 7th and 8th traditions, and ideally earlier to get you two extra envoys and half cost treaties; This will allow you to explore and do first contacts much faster\n* Diplomatically neutralize all nearby AI and don't need much of a fleet, hence doing fine with low alloy production and requiring less minerals overall\n* Create an early Federation for your friends so their fleets will defend you - though if you set things up right they shouldn't need to\n* Expand into many systems using influence from first contacts and your knowledge of where to expand to, and where not to (to avoid genoicidals)\n* Colonize everything early, and I mean everything\n* Your many systems give you a fair amount of minerals, to get more, trade\n* Forget about planet job mining techs (but do take the space mining techs) - the important thing is your energy and food production techs (most early game food production coming from hydroponics, feel free to go several starbases over the cap to produce more food)\n* Trade energy and food with your friends, allies, and, indeed, anybody willing for the minerals you need, the market if necessary\n* As soon as you've completed three tradition groups - ideally some time between 2220 and 2240, start planetary ascension of your highest populated worlds you intend also to be highly populated in the endgame; Assuming you've chosen sensible planetary designations this will either increase your planets main output, your need for consumer goods (and hence also minerals), or your need for minerals (in the case of your forge or factory worlds), AND reduce your empire size. Do NOT sleep on planetary ascension\n\n**About market trades for minerals:** The price does NOT skyrocket; it declines by a fixed percentage per month, so whatever amount of minerals you set as a monthly market trade the price will eventually stabilize based on the amount you set, and if you've focused on energy improving techs in physics the amount it stabilizes around while still being greatly preferable to producing the minerals yourself is pretty high AND you've saved yourself the research of the mining job techs. It is generally better to trade with other empires, but keeping market prices minimal for minerals so as not to \"waste\" energy when trading for it is a strategic mistake - when it is not a very advanced strategy; but since you are having these problem with minerals in the first place, you are definitely not doing it as a very advanced strategy.\n\nBy the time of the mid- and end-game the AI might be swimming in energy and food and value it little (it differs depending on situation and difficulty level) but early game they are great for trade, and by the mid- and late-game vassals can pick up the slack.\n\nI know I've been posting it a lot in this subreddit recently, so my apologies to those who are tired of my doing so, but given your issues I recommend you read the first few chapters of my 3.11 teaching AAR, [Galactic Pacficiation for Dummies](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/galactic-pacification-for-dummies.1654923/), covering the early game.
