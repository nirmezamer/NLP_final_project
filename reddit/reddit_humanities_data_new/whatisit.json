Hell I don't even know what the difference between a boat and a ship is.\n\nI know it's the Chicago river, I know the artist's name appears to be Rocheleau, and the ship appears to be named \"Acacia.\" Don't know when this painting was made or when it is depicting. Possible Japanese flag at the front (bow?) of the ship?\n\nThanks for any info/guesses y'all may have.",
