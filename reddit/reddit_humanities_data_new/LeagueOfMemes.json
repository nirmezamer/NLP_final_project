        "content": "The subreddit r/LeagueOfMemes has, over time, received more and more content that doesn't quite fit any other sub. Sometimes it's casual discussion, low tier gameplay, general questions, bad memes, and similar things of this nature. The main sub r/leagueoflegends has strict content regulation and r/LeagueOfMemes keeps things strictly to memes/humor content. Rather than bend the rules here, we've decided it best to create a sister sub that does not (for the most part) regulate content. \n\nSo, with that in mind, we're happy to introduce r/LowEffortLeague!  **On this sub, you're free to post your bad memes, bad takes on the game, simple questions you could answer on your own by googling it, \"comment your main and I'll tell you X\" posts, etc--whatever your heart desires!**\n\nHowever, there are a few things that won't be allowed:\n\n1. Racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry\n2. NSFW/NSFL content (including porn.... this is NOT a porn sub)\n3. Stolen content\n4. Giveaways, and other content that could fall into potentially scamming users\n5. Spam\n6. TOS breaking content\n\nA few more notes:\n\nYou are allowed to promote your streams and channels **if you have less than 50,000 subscribers and/or followers.** However, you are only allowed to do so by contributing something to the sub. For example, posting \"Watch me live at <this time>!\" would not be allowed. However, posting a gameplay clip and then promoting your channel in that post is fine. If you have more than 50k subscribers/followers and would like to post, simply message the mod team ahead of time to receive approval. \n\nIf you want to promote a discord server or find people to play with, in the interest of safety of the community please message the moderators first and receive prior approval before posting outbound links. Otherwise, they will be blocked by automod.\n\n---\n\nAs time goes forward we will likely have to adjust these, but hopefully this serves as a good starting point for the sub.\n\nHave fun everyone, hope to see you over at r/LowEffortLeague!",

            "Idk wtf is happening in RIOT but for the past 6 month everything seems to be about making more money. Obv it's always the main thing a company wants to do but things are getting really absurd recently.",
            "this new 200$ skin looks exactly like the first splash but at a different angle and pose, at least the other ones changed the skin even if it was only a little",
            "RIOT only pays its bills thanks to SIMPs who play sexy champions and spend money on them. I'm sure they don't make billions of dollars, they just had to do such a dishonorable act to make ends meet.",
            "riot be like when they run out of skin ideas but in spite of this they must make the 72528th mf skin cause this is where most of their money mainly comes from lmao",
            "Isn't it the $200 mythic scam thing again?",
            "When will we ever get something as amazing as Space Groove Blitz again?",
            "The original looks so much better, I don't see the point...",
            "my boy Ryze about to hit the 1000 day club let's goooo",
            "Whales need the $200 ~~Chroma~~ Version. duh",
            "What even is the skin",
            "![gif](giphy|SOmjomEnNHsrK|downsized)\n\nRiot:",
            "Why does this look exactly like the other skin she has.\nPrestige Broken Covenant Miss Fortune",
            "Are we getting a pve event? If not, I sleep",
            "Vote with your wallet",
            "Rito can't catch a break huh?",
            "They make skins that people would buy. That\u2019s it.",
            "I know this skinline is a long excuse so they never have to make any more skins related to vanilla Battle Bunny Riven, but I really would like them to make more Battle Bunny skins like vanilla Battle Bunny Riven.",
            "where my battle bunny bard mfs",
            "i mean, the first battle bunny mf, was kinda ass, most people didnt even realize it was a legendary. \n\nbut i guess we now know what the release skin for aurora is gonna be",
            "And I am gonna buy it like every previous gacha. Somebody needs support the game so you can keep playing for free.",
            "I have a theory that they need more themes for tft so they don't have to recycle as much so it just leads to rushed bullshit.",
            "gotta pay somehow for the leadership bonuses, layoffs werent enough.",
            "Hey Risoto is a small indie company, got to pay rent somehow",
            "Only the past 6 months? It's been like this for the past 3 years at minimum.",
            "Coincidentally 6 months ago i stopped spending money on the game as i reached over 1000 skins and even more chromas around that time, maybe they need new sources of income now that im not bankrolling them anymore (sidenote im joking im well aware im not in the 0.1% that they seem to be targetting as of late)",
            "As a current finance student, all college preaches right now is that profit is #1 goal above all else. Which, sure, but when a bunch of MBAs get involved in industries they personally don't care much about, you get the decisions riot makes where the fans are simply livestock to be milked for their income.",
            "Yup, new Seraphine legendary. Zilean still has less polygons than one of Dravens axes",
            "Everyting went to shit after the Spirit Blossom.",
            "First time?",
            "It's been that way for years, you just haven't noticed until now.",
            "I really wonder, is this greed money, or are they trying to make up for costs of Arcane, the MMO, and whatever is \u201cchanging league forever 2025\u201d early?\n\nBecause while it could be greed, all those projects gotta be expensive as shit right?",
            "Thats because NA is so bad in e-sports, their whole e-sport marketing is breaking apart and they need more money for e-sport.   \nThats basicly it.",
            "They are making a whole new PVE event though. I get hating on Rito but they do some good stuff",
            "If onlywe have someone to keep them in check (Tencent doesn't give a shit, they're the master at predatory tactics).",
            "We're getting skins for bel'veth, rek'sai, and briar. Ignoring the faker ahri skin fiasco, I feel like they have a pretty good balance between trying to make money and making things that people enjoy. Look at how much work they've put into arena and this new pve mode. I think there's a limit they should put on prices for cosmetics, but I'm glad that they're able to get the funds to make cool content like they've been doing.",
            "Yeah, with every piece of new content I am more disappointed. I was playing, took a break, saw this post and decided thats enough of my time for this shitty company for the day",
            "U gotta face it, why listen to us enjoying a free to play game when Korea be like: oh that ahri though. money talks u know. I'd listen to my sugar daddy too if i had one",
            "Only for the past 6 months? Feels like it's been down that spiral further and further for the last 6 years",
            "Gotta fund the MMO that they canceled and are redoing.",
            "Late stage capitalism smth smth",
            "Massive losses from 2020-2021 across the entire company. Riot isn\u2019t the only company who made business decisions during the pandemic that has not made back its investments which has led to more corporate greed and panic.",
            "with addition of ears that look like tiny tina",
            "They might as well make more 500$ skins, fuck it at this point.",
            "I am one of them. Tryharded the eve battlepass for th\u00e9 prestige like one week before she got nerfed to th\u00e9 ground",
            "But like have you looked at urgot?",
            "How dare they use sound marketing strategies ?...",
            "Not really a scam when you are getting and are aware of exactly what you are paying for.\n\nIt's ripoff for sure, but scam would imply illegality when in reality it's just annoying.",
            "Yes",
            "when we will fucking buy them more than sexy bunny outfits",
            "Or space groove gragas",
            "Simps",
            "We are getting a PvE event\u00a0",
            "this implies you either only play/seen gun goddess or you've never played miss fortune\n\nthe animation difference between base fortune and battle bunny is leagues apart",
            "yes so the second one is 200usd, line up lil pay piggies! \ud83d\ude0f",
            "Underrated comment",
            "i doubt it considering they're more than willing to just straight up make their own models/characters for tft.",
            "Considering TFT is willing to make models and take Themes from LoR Cards I doubt that. Set 13 is already set in stones anyways and Mort also confirmed they're working till set 15.",
            "not a theory, it\u2019s been like this since shortly after TFT launch, when they started releasing skinlines with 4-5 champions per batch consistently.\n\nthere is a mort post somewhere saying they NEED that for TFT",
            "And for the sexual harassment lawsuits haha",
            "Ever since riot was sold to tencent",
            "A happy cow produce more and better milk than a starved sad one. \n\nhttps://www.allaboutfeed.net/home/happy-cows-produce-more-milk/\n\nSpoiler alert: this also applies to consumers. I dont know if they teach that at your MBAs but they should.",
            "Sad but true \ud83d\ude14",
            "Of course they would be expensive but the main costs would still most likely be in the pockets of higher ups and not actually going into content",
            "Yeah, and it will be in the game for like 3 weeks. The shitty mtx are here forever.",
            "Let's be real, you namedropped the 3 hottest ladies in league",
            "All I'm hoping is they're using it in the mmo",
            "Also Seraphine Legendary is a bit meh, since she has a ultimate skin, but since she has not legendary it's comprehensive, and Aatrox legendary literally everyone wanted that shit so it's a big W.\n\nThey gave legendary skins to champs without legendary, it's good enough, although giving prestiges to Yuumi and Leona that already have while there's champs in the skinline without a single prestige it's lackluster.",
            "Who said they wouldn't?",
            "Samesies. One of my bigger monetary regrets in gaming. I loved Eve and was so excited for a prestige. It even got me playing jungle more. Now she\u2019s trash.",
            "i would be a good employee in the sales team",
            "Well if we really want to get technical then if it's that gacha bullshit again then it's technically illegal in my country as they would have to comply with all laws regarding gambling, which they obviously don't do. That being said all other gacha games are breaking the law here as well, the government just doesn't care.",
            "Ok yes but it's a scam",
            "This is mega cope, it\u2019s a scam.",
            "It literally is illegal in a lot of countries they're doing it in.",
            "The common simp doesn't have the taste in skins for such masterpieces as space groove blitz and crank, or perhaps moo cow Alistair... Or, by jove, even corporate mundo",
            "hey im not saying the skin is below standard, like samira. \n\nbut between the myriad of skins mf has, and the 3 coloured gungoddes that  strikes a similar scy-fi vibe than battlebunny \n\nshe didnt get that much attention.",
            "They did 2 nonplayable characters this set, Kabuko and Alune. Most times it is one character, but not every set. And I have to assume they existed somewhere before TFT. It's still a lot easier to use existing character models.",
            "I mean \"themes\" more in terms of in-game character models they can just pluck. They can't just takes models from LoR and put them in TFT for obvious reasons.",
            "So 2011?",
            "Nah not really. The ideal pin point in fair competition without price collusion is where consumer surplus is at a sweetspot and so is producer surplus... AKA consumers aren't fully drained of all income for maximum profit, yet this is still overshadowed by the maximum profit mantra",
            "I mean, if everyone buys mf skins and no one buys ivern skins, what would make the cows happier, a new mf skin or a new ivern skin?",
            "What's so shitty about a mf skin? Or is it one of those 200\u20ac chromas?",
            "2/3 of those champs don\u2019t even have feet, no way riot makes money off this batch of skins",
            "Honestly seraphine's ultimate skin isn't that good imo. The only ultimate thing about it is that there's 3 different versions of it; each individual skin is alright but not amazing. I'd have to see the legendary before passing judgement on it, although I'd agree based on splash that it doesn't look amazing or anything.",
            "Isn't it banned in Belgium?",
            "Just to play devils advocate, it's not actually. \n\nLeague's system ensures that after X amount of capsules, you will guarantee get a specific reward, you just also have a chance at a reward sooner rather than that specific X amount. This makes it so that, by technicality, it's not \"true\" gambling. It's scummy, but it's objectively different than lotteries and pure gambling which are guaranteed to make the player not gain anything in the long run. It's essentially advertised as a 200$ item with a chance to get it for less.\n\nAs well, lootboxes are a decade and a half old now starting with TF2 and it's unusuals and crates. Unless Valve, Ubisoft, Supercell, Blizzard or literally any other video game company has action taken against it, Riot won't either, especially considering Riot somehow has the least predatory version of lootboxes due to the guaranteed reward.",
            "Fair but to say you couldnt tell it was a legendary made it sound like you thought it was worse than her base animations",
            "Kabuko was brand new for tft I believe, idk if the alune model was from somewhere",
            "2015.",
            "Pretty sure it is a mythic variant yes.",
            "Reksai has feet and they are the best in the game.\u00a0",
            "As far as I\u2019m aware it\u2019s just completely random lootboxes that are banned like with Fifa. Stuff like this that has a pity system (you get the skin at 30 capsules) are considered fair game and the cost of the 30 capsules are just considered the price, the potential to get it earlier is just a nice little price cut.",
            "I believe it technically is in most EU countries they just don't enforce it.",
            "It was 2011",
            "Bro, maybe get your facts right.",
            "Rip",
            "If only they did fk that",
            "Few years ago there were talks about banning the gacha practices in the EU as a whole but apparently the EP is more concerned about spying on its own citizens (looks at the new chat control law they are considering) than protecting them."
