            "While those soles look cool, I don\u2019t think they look dressy/smart enough to be a formal shoe like that. I guess it all depends on what look you\u2019re ok with.",
            "Wow these look like medical shoes.\u00a0",
            "Depends. The shoes immediately look less smart and formal so in that sense no.",
            "Attention, personal opinion incoming:\n\nFor the love of all that is good and holy, don\u2018t put Vibram soles on dress shoes.",
            "I do not think they look good under dress shoes.",
            "Those are not dress shoes tho, it\u2019s intentionally chunky shoes.\n\nIf you get dress shoes with leather soles, you can get a cobbler to install a vibram pad. On the front half and back half. https://www.masonandsmith.com/products/vibram-explosion-half-rubber-sole",
            "No sole is BIFL. A well made dress shoe can be, but it will have to be resoled/reheeled eventually.",
            "Probably out of your price range but Allen Edmonds can have a dannite rubber sole. They look dressy and last much longer than their leather soles. I\u2019m slowly migrating my dress shoes to them.",
            "That is not a dress shoe, not with that sole",
            "First off, those shoes don\u2019t look great. Secondly, those are also quite cheap for shoes. I\u2019d doubt they are bifl at all.",
            "People are missing the point that Vibram is not a particular type of sole but rather a company that makes various kinds of soles, including dress soles. That\u2019s understandable given the picture OP chose but true nonetheless. \n\nThe bigger point, though, is that no *sole* is BIFL. The soles of your shoes are going to wear out with enough wear. But, *shoes* can be BIFL, or close to it, if they are easily resoleable, provided they are otherwise cared for well enough and don\u2019t suffer any acute injuries. That is to say that a cobbler or other skilled individual can remove the old sole and put on a new one after the sole inevitably wears out. Generally footwear that is resoleable has soles that are stitched or welted to the shoe instead of glued. \n\nWhile you see stitching around the welt of the shoes OP posted, it looks like a fake welt to me and I\u2019d bet that these soles are glued not stitched. This is also a price point at which stitched/welted footwear is going to be in the extreme minority. \n\nThere are also variations in durability of types of soles. For a rubber sole that\u2019s workable in an office setting, I would recommend Danite. However, a more durable sole is going to be less comfortable and I avoid Danite line the plague, because it\u2019s like walking on concrete. Plus, if you\u2019re considering Danite your footwear is already resoleable so I\u2019d rather resole it slightly more often and be more comfortable in between",
            "For 25$ extra? Probably worth it.\n\nNever seen vibram on dress shoes, but they make the best soles for every other kind of shoe",

            "Vibram soles aren\u2019t more \u201cresistant\u201d or durable in anyway. Vibram soles are designed to grip on wet conditions.  Are they worth the cost just for that? I\u2019d say yes, but it doesn\u2019t make them any more durable",
            "It makes them look like dr  martens.\n\nSo if that's the style you're shooting for it s great idea.",
            "These look like creepers.",
            "If they are high quality they will last but you may have to get them re-soled. It is surely more comfortable to walk in, especially if you have any foot pain,  and gives you an extra 1/2 inch. They don\u2019t look formal if that\u2019s what you are going for but definitely business casual.",
            "a guy i know got a disc golf disc made by Vibram if you can believe that or not",
            "So come to find out, a Darby shoe is an Oxford\u2019s business-casual brother. These, technically, aren\u2019t dress shoes.",
            "I would recommend looking up soles for the conditions you walk in. Some are not meant for walking a lot. Some are very slippery in wet surfaces etc. \n\nPeople also add metal plates to the heel and toes on the bottom to help with wear.",
            "If you're in a situation that requires rubber soles, then a dress shoe is the wrong shoe. Dress shoes are for specific situations or environments. Rubber soled shoes are for anywhere. If you want a mix of the two, cowboy boots can alternate both situations.",
            "Vibram is actually a brand made by oil companies that figured out a waste product from oil refining can be used to make a rubber-like material that is great for shoes.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0soles are cheap to manufacture and often replaceable. IMO real BIFL shoes are the type cobblers can repair with simple materials like leather or wood and not dependent on the petroleum industry.\u00a0 \n\nEdit: also those shoes look ridiculous. Not BIFl material.",
            "No shoe is BIFL. Also those are ugly",
            "Vibram soles wear super fast but perform well. Not bifl.",
            "Please consider buying a used pair of high quality dress shoes over these crappy ones. You can find used Allen Edmonds, Alden, Trickers, Carmina, Sanders, Crockett and Jones, etc. for less than you\u2019re paying for these. And as others said any cobbler can add a rubber half sole to protect the leather.",
            "Doctor? Yeah why not. Otherwise just don\u2019t they don\u2019t look sartorial. Not elegantu!!!",
            "Shoe choice aside, I had a vibram sole on a pair of my oxfords. It came with them. Lasted about 3 years (which is a very long time for soles on shoes I frequently wear). Replaced them with traditional leather soles and they have been a pain ever since. Also the leather wore through in one season.",
            "They're not BIFL, but they're definitely worth it. Vibram soles are fantastic.",
            "buy good quality dress shoes (they start at 300ish) that are stitched together, this way most cobblers can easily replace the sole, which is a wear item anyway",
            "Any goodyear or repairable construction type is BIFL.  You are asking a use case question which we don't have the answer to.  Sole type selection is a function of geography and use case.  Vibram soles are for people work outside and/or in wet conditions a lot....if this is you, then these are a good choice unless you just like the look.",
            "Rubber soles will never outclass leather soles for dress shoes",
            "Problem is typically you are wearing dress shoes because you want shoes that look nice, and these soles make them look godawful. Like you couldn\u2019t wear those shoes to a wedding or work",
            "Doc Martin has had these types of soles for years. Totally worth it",
            "Yah it ruins the look of that shoe",
            "They also make you look like you should be old enough to wear Depends.",
            "OR WHITE F'ING SOLES!!!",
            "Why? Ive used Vibram topy sheets for leather soled dress shoes and loafers, love their Vbar sole for dressier boots...Vibram is fairly well regarded around the world for their extensive collection of hard wearing, and good looking, soles. Did you mean to just say \"dont put chunky/thick lugged soles on dress shoes\"?",
            "Please read rule 1 as the L in BIFL is not literal.  Any goodyear welted shoe is BIFL.",
            "Are they comfortable to wear for 6-8 hours too? I\u2019m looking for dress shoes for my wedding next year.",
            "Traditional leather sole Allen Edmonds shoe wearer that I bought specifically for my wedding. They are great have added a black pair \n\nBreak in the shoes before the wedding. I wore my shoes to work every day for a month before.",
            "Well the thing is I don\u2019t really wear dress shoes all too often. I know I can break them it sitting at my home office but I don\u2019t know if I want that either."

            "> how likely is it the manufacturer intentionally selects materials that age this poorly, so as to make me consider (briefly) a replacement?\n\nI doubt it, assuming it was white to begin with I rarely see plastic stuff this yellowed, including my mom's KitchenAid food processor from around the same time period. Are you storing it somewhere that's exposed to heat regularly?\n\n> is there any way to refresh this housing, using chemicals or heat?\n\nRetro computer enthusiasts have a process they call \"Retrobrite\" where you cover the plastic in hydrogen peroxide and expose it to UV light, either from the sun or from a blacklight\n\n> why does the mixer merit a finish that\u2019s so much more durable?\n\nThey do different jobs, so they're made of different materials that have to be finished in different ways",
