The hardware is just slow, modern hardware is many, many multiples times faster that any remotely modern software is going to have a bad time on that CPU. You could get a much more modern laptop for under $200 that would run circles around that CPU. You could aim even higher for cheaper if you go with a used desktop.",

There are so many things it is bad at in 2024, but you have to work with what you have.\n\nI actually upgraded the 430M in my laptop to a i5 580M from AliExpress as it is a socketed chip anyways. That has given it a bit more life but compared to even a modern 5600G it is outdated as it can be. So you might look into that as AliExpress has a lot of cheap CPUs now, I have seen the 430M for as low as $2, so anything from the P6100 line should not be more expensive anyways. Depends on your laptop supporting multiple CPUs.",

            "I'll also add in here - being from 2010, there is a good chance that this laptop has a spinning hard drive and somewhere between 2 and 4 GB of RAM. Even if not, check your Task Manager. If it says Disk 100%, it needs replaced. If this is the case, I'd look into upgrading both. Upgrading the storage will mean a fresh install of Windows. RAM can be upgraded to 8 GB of DDR3-1066 SODIMM.\n\nEdit: I noticed that the CPU is socketed, rare for laptops. Staying at 35 watts, you could upgrade to an i7-640m. If the motherboard supports 45 watts, you could upgrade to an i7-8400m, and at 55 watts an i7-940XM. Not that higher watts mean less battery life.\nFor a more complete list of processors available, you can search for Socket G1 / rPGA988A / PGA988. Make sure to cross reference them with your laptop model for compatibility.",
