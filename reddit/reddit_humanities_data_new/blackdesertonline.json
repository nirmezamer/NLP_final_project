            "I feel like the 1000% combat exp buff isn't active as I literally only get like around 0.50% exp per kill. Lvl 58 character.",
            "I posted this as a text post but it was removed by automod so I guess I have to ask here.\n\nI and a friend of mine have decided to give BDO a try, and as was suggested by several guides (and common sense), we made seasonal characters. Now, for a new player the game is quite confusing and overwhelming, at first anyway. And since we're not playing together every day, and it's not the only game we play anyway, I wanted to do what I've done in several MMOs in the past, and make a second character alongside to play alone and at my own pace, to help learn the game better, to try out a different class and to fill the time in between us playing together.\n\nHowever, the button to make a seasonal character is greyed out, and after a little bit of googling, I've learned that while you can make several seasonal characters, you apparently can't do so at the same time. So, it seems like my options right now are:\n\n* Delete the current character and make a new one, which I obviously don't want to do.\n* Continue playing the character I have and abandon my friend, which I also don't want to do.\n* Don't play the game alone at all, and wait to see if and when we continue together, which I didn't want to do but to my surprise seems to be what the game wants at this point.\n* Make a non-seasonal character, which every guide under the sun warns new players not to do.\n\nAm I understanding this correctly, that making multiple characters as a new player is heavily discouraged? Or is making a non-seasonal character not that big a deal? How big a difference does being on a seasonal character make? What does the game actually want me to do at this point, and what would be your suggestion?\n\nAnd as a side question, how do items and currencies work when graduating a character to non-seasonal? Do I lose access to everything in my storage, does it move with me, or are the storages shared to begin with? Is the central market shared or separate? And what about seasonal-only items, do those simply disappear?\n\nSorry for the slew of questions, but that's probably the usual new player experience. \ud83d\ude05",

            "The main point is that you have a season character to collect bonus rewards. So you can make a non season character anytime you want, that is perfectly fine.",
            "You can check the amount of season character tickets you have in your character screen - PA gives away a new season ticket roughly every 4 months or so. You can create several season characters, just not simultaneously. You just have to graduate your current season character before starting a new one.\n\nYou don't lose anything after graduating. Your character simply inherits the gear and can not join the season servers anymore.",
            "As a new player you will likely want to get the blackstar mainhand or awakening (depending which spec you play).",
            "so there are 3 types of origins. the old event ones increase a fail stack upon devouring in the black spirit menu. its 100% just like pen green weapons/armors for example and it goes up to 230 (base fs, no cry etc).\n\nthen you can grind the green origins from city of the dead and tunrad or buy them on the market. those increase up to 300 base fs. \n\nthe dim origin you have there also go to 300, but have a 2.5% chance to fail ober 290 for whatever reason.\n\nthe big differences here is how much fs you gain. the green ones are much more efficent and give +4 between 220 and 250 or so, the dim origins only 2 under ~220 and then +1. you should therefor only use them if you dont planon using the greens, or for example for the last increase between 281 and 300 or such.\n\nyou should also know that failing with cron stones also gives +1 now.\n\n\n\n\nwhat to choose? you cannot sell that black star. you can fail it or make it godr-ayed. in case you want to enhance a pen yourself use it as the one to tap pen on, if you want to buy your pens, go with the offhand and fail stack for pen deboreka later. the gain over kutum is only 5 monster ap and dr, so you dont need it asap but eventually it could make sense.",
            "I see, thanks! :)",
            "Wait so you can use skills during its cooldown but i will do less dmg?",
            "Is the only difference for a seasonal character the items? And how hard would it be for a new player to go without those? I've heard about some Naru and Tuvala gear and so on, but I'm not sure how difficult it would be to replace those for me, and whatever other important items the seasonal character gets.",
            "Yes. And will lose any kinda of CC it has. Only certain skills. Example would be violation on sorceress. You can spam it but only the first two do the damage and have the KD.",
            "it is extremly dificult to go the \"original\" route of enhancing your own gear (tuvala is basicly tet yellow weapons and armors), but you can exchange naru you get on all chars once for narchilian gear. that doesnt help you progress like you would with tuvala, but its more than enough for early to low mid game spots and you could explore the world that way.\n\nbdos progress is gear, so getting used to grinding isnt the worst idea. if you not already in a guild i highly encourage you to join one. you will miss something otherwise and you get nice boni.",
            "Every new character you make should do a part of the main story quest to get inventory slots, and free Naru gear.\n\nThe seasonal character will have bonus goals and rewards, and it can turn the Naru gear into better Tuvala gear.\n\nSo just give it a go, nothing bad is going to happen if you start a new non-seasonal character and check it out.\n\nEventually you should make a bunch of random characters to leave at places for convenience e.g. like boss alts."

It's so much smoother on a lot of classes. \n\nAlso correct me if I'm wrong and just seeing things but I think hit count change is actual buff for early game spots although very tiny.

When I asked in chat her gear, the answer was 317\\\\423 or something like that.  \nI have 317 \\\\ 420 with + lightstone combo + crystals for pvp. The other ninja has something like that too.\n\n  \nI'm literally f\\*\\*\\* not going to rbf or Arsha again until .

My damage done to mobs seemed the same, although my dps skill rotation is shorter now with a small dead spot that needs to be filled either due to the hits or animation being shorter. (Succ Maegu)\n\nIn Guild League I found that I was just as squishy with my Eva off-hand as I was with my Acc off-hand, and that ironically, putting my PVE Kutum on was the most successful at not dying, and doing much more damage in PVP.

Also, valk, zerk, nova team is indestructible while still dealing tons of damage, it took like first 10 minutes after patch to find so many balance issues.

Pet cannot proc skill add-ons now. 3) HP is likely much much more valuable than before and Tamer has like the lowest HP in the game.

You can make as many good points or direct observations you want about why a class is bad or did not do well in a meta shift and you just get down voted by a bunch of don't know nothen about the game noobs.

You are just going to get a bunch \"get good\" comments from people with less than 100 kills in RBF or \"XYZs are always crying\" or whatever and then a bunch of down votes.  Its just Reddit.\n\nThere is a class in the middle blind spot for PA when the meta shift every few years.  Its been Range Meta since Rework with Archers etc 1-shotting, and now they shifted to Shield and Gauntlets are Immortal.  The classes in the middle never move when the seesaw pivots.",

In addition Bloody Calamity is a long animation and Tendrils is a long animation.  All but DoD (unprotected) are SAs.  So it can't be long animations.\n* Sorcs have pretty much the flatest class damage modifiers of any class sitting very close to 1.0 consistently (check it out).  So it can't be class damage modifier based.\n\nIn other words are the original poster pointed out there are PLENTY of squishy classes on par with Witch/Wiz that were stuck with the 10% flat SA protection.

        "content": "[https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/Forum/ForumTopic/Detail?\\_topicNo=57200&\\_page=1](https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/Forum/ForumTopic/Detail?_topicNo=57200&_page=1)\n\n  \nI just posted this topic in the feedback forum, please share and vote if you agree! \n\n\n\n# Problem:\n\nMany players consider a Perfect Fairy\\* a goal to achieve, but the current system makes this unnecessarily difficult.\n\nEspecially for players who are unable or unwilling to buy Theia's Orbs from the Pearl Shop.\n\n\n\nThe current system follows a simple method:\n\n1. (Optional) Obtain a T3 fairy and sprout her to T4\n\n2. Feed the fairy blue gear until the next level and hope for the right skill\n\n3. If you get the wrong skill, reset the fairy and try again\n\n\n\nThe difficulty with this method is that you may end up getting lucky at the start and get two key skills at level V but get unlucky with the third skill.\n\nNow you are left with a\u00a0**hard**\u00a0choice: Settle for two key skills\u00a0**or**\u00a0reset the fairy and risk not getting those key skills again (leading you to reset again and again until you succeed).\n\n\n\nWhile it is true that all you need is silver to try again, it requires that you either save up a large amount of silver to try enough times to succeed\u00a0**or**\u00a0you take a step back in the progression while you save up more silver to try again.\n\n\n\n\\* Miraculous Cheer V, Feathery Steps V, Continous Care V, Fairy's Tear IV and Morning Light (one of the last two may be swapped for Tingeling Breath V for a life skiller)\n\n\n\n# Proposed solution:\n\nThis problem is similar to how we enhance our gear (an attempt might fail and put you back). Unlike that system, we have\u00a0**no**\u00a0safe guards.\n\nFor gear enhancing we have options, such as using Cron Stones or upgrading a second copy from the gear we're using.\n\n\n\nI propose that a system be implemented where players can\u00a0store\u00a0***a single***\u00a0fairy in the \"Unstable Crevice**\"**\u00a0at the Kamasylve Temple node for a\u00a0**large**\u00a0silver fee.\n\n\n\nThis would mean that players could\u00a0**store**\u00a0their current T4 fairy and try again on a new fairy.\n\nIf that fairy doesn't obtain the right skills, they can release her and then take out their\u00a0**stored**\u00a0fairy to keep playing until they are able to try again.\n\n  \n",

            "IT would be huge, but doubt we will get it because theia orbs would get less usefull. Currently I have quite good T3 fairy (3 out of 4 skills I want). Do I risk upgrading it to T4 and getting worse skills? Ofc not. So Im stuck with T3 untill I swipe for theia orbs (they seem to not give them for free anymore) which I prolly wont ever do.\n\nYou cant even reset ur bad T4 fairy and retry for free. You also need Pearl Shop item for that which is just ridiculus.",
            "Imo the quickest way to fix this issue is to let it cost one orb to change a skill regardless of levels. Unlike now where it increases by one orb every time a new skill is learned. This would require minimum effort and time for PA to implement and make it a whole lot easier for players.",
            "How about we just make an system where it can be achieved in a decent manner without having to buy it. Let whales speed up the process with buying it, just make a time gated way to do it for free. (Ideally no P2W at all but that\u2019s for my dreams)",
            "the problem still is that a t3 doesnt have the option to unlock the highest skill level or the skill continuous care. the last one is more endgame to manage elixir rota, III is even enough. but not having 2s potion use is unplayable for classes with bad/long cd heals.",
