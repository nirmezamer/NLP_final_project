That's gross sales but the way, not net.\n\nMy dad worked as a small appliance and television repair person for about 15 years. The license doubled as a permit to buy and sell electronics. At some point, my brother and I started working for him.\n\nMy dad taught my brother about electronics, fabrication, etc. I went to college. I ended up working with my dad when the degree didn't pay for itself. I managed the shop while they were away.\n\nWhen the repair industry began to die, he expanded the business to secondhand dealing. It allowed us to buy and sell more than what we could with the BEARHFTI (now BHGS) license permitted.\n\nMy dad already had lots of contacts since he's started his business with a stellar reputation from Curtis Mathes, so during those fifteen years it really expanded. \n\nI can remember one time going with my dad to some millionaires property with two huge mansions at the end of a long drive way surrounded by tall gates. In the one he was working in, there was a managerie of exotic birds in the back yard. I spent quite some time contemplating the gold-plated toilet seat I saw in the bathroom. I couldn't wrap my head around how useless it was. I think I was ten.\n\nAnyway, a few doors down from our shop we had a long time family friend who was also a pawn shop owner. He had served in the Navy with Richard Harrison (Old Man from Pawn Stars) and was a friend of his.\n\nHe shared a lot of insider information on the pawn business (and related, secondhand dealing) with my dad and said that when he officially retired, he wanted to sell the business to my dad, although my dad didn't want it.\n\nHe didn't retire though.\n\nUltimately, he died of medical malpractice. This was about a few months after Old Man died. Dad still didn't want to buy the business, so his widow tried to sell it. No one wanted it.\n\nSo, she ended up selling all the inventory they had and closing it. Dad ended up with some people who were looking to buy that inventory asking about his. So dad started making some more connections, including connections to abandoned storage auctions and such. That was almost six years ago.\n\nSo.... yeah.",

Specifically, they are TOPPS cards.\n\nAs to what they actually contain, I again reiterate we do not know, however given previous advice from a card shop owner and from prior negative experience, it is best not to deal with online sales.\n\n- TCGs: Five brand new, sealed Pokemon or MtG box sets ranging from $35 to $100. Confirmed legit. INADs on all five. All five had cards missing (rares, holos, etc). Separate addresses, separate usernames, across three years.\n\n- Card Shop Owner: Some warnings include frivolous chargebacks because card wanted was not in pack or box. As well as fraudulent returns with resealed packs (like OP). He sells online too, but only graded.\n\nSo, yeah. Previous experience and contact supports action. Last we checked, one of these boxes was trending sold on eBay for $300. The other two, under $100.",
