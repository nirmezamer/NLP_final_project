        "content": "Howdy r/videos,\n\nWe all know the robots are coming for our jobs and our lives - but now they're coming for our subreddit too.\n\nMultiple videos that have weird scripts that sound like they've come straight out of a kindergartener's thesaurus now regularly show up in the new queue, and all of them voiced by those same slightly off-putting set of cheap or free AI voice clones that everyone is using.\n\nNot only are they annoying, but 99 times out of 100 they are also just bad videos, and, unfortunately, there is a very large overlap between the sorts of people who want to use AI to make their Youtube video, and the sorts of people who'll pay for a botnet to upvote it on Reddit.\n\nSo, starting today, we're proposing a full ban on low effort AI generated content. As mods we often already remove these, but we don't catch them all. You will soon be able to report both posts and comments as 'AI' and we'll remove them.\n\nThere will, however, be a few small exceptions. **All of which must have the new AI flair applied** (_which we will sort out in the coming couple days - a little flair housekeeping to do first_).\n\nSome examples:\n\n- Use of the tech in collaboration with a strong human element, e.g. creating a cartoon where AI has been used to help generate the video element based on a human-written script. \n- Demonstrations the progress of the technology (e.g. [Introducing Sora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK6y8DAPN_0))\n- Satire that is actually funny (e.g. [satirical adverts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSewd6Iaj6I), deepfakes that are obvious and amusing) - though remember Rule 2, NO POLITICS\n- Artistic pieces that aren't just crummy visualisers \n\nAll of this will be up to the r/videos denizens, if we see an AI piece in the new queue that meets the above exceptions and is getting strongly upvoted, so long as is properly identified, it can stay.\n\nThe vast majority of AI videos we've seen so far though, do not.\n\nThanks, we hope this makes sense.\n\n**Feedback welcome! If you have any suggestions about this policy, or just want to call the mods a bunch of assholes, now is your chance.**",

            "Thank you!",
            "I will say what I've said in every sub I'm a member of that has proposed similar: banning low-effort, content that contributes nothing to the sub is a great idea. Trying to do so by specifically targeting AI generated outputs is a mistake for many reasons:\n\n1. The need to carve out specific exceptions to the AI rule in your OP makes it clear that AI itself is not the problem, just another vector for low quality.\n2. The quality of AI generated results in any given genra or medium is going to start out poor and grow better with time (c.f. *Will Smith Eating Spaghetti* from a year ago.) The baseline AI generated video will probably be better than most of the content out there in 10 years and it will be a continuous gain until then.\n3. Low quality is hardly difficult to find, AI or not. (c.f. *Jim Cornette on Chris Jericho Thinking He Was Abducted By Aliens*, and *This video only has 300 views... Please explain*, posted an hour ago and two hours ago respectively)\n\nSo you end up adding more bulk to the rules while adding little or no value in terms of their aplication.\n\nHere's an alternate proposal that I think gets you everything that you want:\n\n### Rule #n: Baseline quality\n\nAll posts must involve some recognizable element of effort and quality. Videos that have no original elements, audio or video that is too low quality to be intelligible, or do not advance any recognizale infoformation, commentary or satire will be deleted. Exceptions will be made in exceptional circumstances, but this is the \"you must be this tall\" for this sub.\n\nThere you go.",
            "I don't think this is the right solution. What you are really trying to curb is low quality videos, and to do so you are banning a type of video that is likely to be low quality. If you want to stem a tide of low quality videos, regardless of their source, the right solution is to limit the number of posts users can make.\n\nYou're going to get into dicey territory if you try to enforce an AI ban. You may have some initial success, but your first problem is that you're going to get false positives, which is going to piss off the people who have posts removed because a mod thought it was AI when it wasn't. As the technology improves, you're going to have an even harder time distinguishing videos, and you're going to get more false positives and a whole bunch of false negatives as well. I think you're going to end up alienating a lot of your community.",

Seems more reasonable, yeah? If someone goes to great lengths to create an actual, high-quality video, using AI in part or all of it, seems sad it couldn't be posted here.",

So it just seems like a knee-jerk reaction to a new artistic tool. With AI art becoming common in museums and local galleries, you may be responding to negative sentiment that's already shifting to positive. \n\nAnd since reddit now has to worry about shareholder value now, let me add an extra argument from a business perspective: AI video tools will be used in a large percentage of videos in the coming year, and if those popular videos are banned on this platform, eyeballs and clicks will be lost and stock price will fall.",

We all thought we'd have them by now, and although your Waymos and Cruises can just about get around the roads in the Bay Area, give them anything remotely challenging like weather or roadworks and they can't deal with it.\n\nMaking a video is a much easier problem to solve than that, but it's also still early days in many respects.",
            "There are a lot of easy clues you can look for now, that will be significant, and I mean *significant* computing challenges to overcome.\n\nHere's an example of a video that looks cool, but is great for illustrating one, major, glaring issue:\n\n[https://youtu.be/0I2XlDZxiPc?si=mCYXZy\\_LiM4jFbZA](https://youtu.be/0I2XlDZxiPc?si=mCYXZy_LiM4jFbZA)\n\nNotice what they're *not* doing in this video. They're not showing us two cuts of the same scene. Never do we get a second angle, a very typical, expected thing you're going to want going in using any tool to make a film scene. They *cannot currently create a second angle using the tools they have.* The AIs generating this video wholesale will generate one clip. And then you want a slight variation? Good luck! It's going to hallucinate things differently this time. Shoulder pads will look different. Helmets will have different types of visors on them. It won't be something that passes a basic reality-check that we all do all the time unconsciously while we're watching video. Things will be off, and in a way that even people who only kind of pay attention to video at all will start to notice. Each of the individual cuts in this video represent a different prompt/query to the machine. All of them probably contain a lot of the stylistic notes of what they're trying to emulate, but ultimately, nobody has solved consistency yet. It's a huge problem across the industry--if you want to make art, you need to be able to dial in consistency and specifics, and this type of generative video just...doesn't really do that, doesn't even allow for it in the way you'd expect. And the kicker? The AI experts, the people who build this stuff, are saying we might need computers, and power plants to run them, that are so powerful they don't even exist yet to hold enough context to be able to do this basic \"keep things consistent between scenes you hallucinate\" functionality. It's a huge, huge gap in the capabilities right now that I haven't seen any realistic plan to get past.\n\nThis is not, however, a reflexively anti-AI screed! I use AI tools when I'm making my own art, which is music. But the tools I use? They use AI to eliminate busy work, or repetitive work. One thing they're *really* good at right now is separating a full, mixed track into individual components. So I can sample a bassline from a song, without needing to EQ, and lose some of the higher dynamic ranges, the way I used to when I wanted a bassline from a song. Acapellas? It used to be you'd either have to go through hours of painstaking, detail work, that might not even pan out, or hope that the official acapella was loaded up to Youtube. Outside of that, you were kinda screwed. But that's just not a thing anymore.\n\nAI tools that are picked up by professionals won't be this kind of stuff, the \"prompt it and it creates a whole shot\" stuff. That's a marketing brochure. The stuff pros want is the stuff that takes what used to be hours of human labor, oftentimes not even really \"smart\" labor, but painstaking and guided by a singular artistic goal, and automates that. Generative models are not that. Generative models appeal to bosses who don't want to pay artists. But ultimately, talking with other artists and a few honest bosses who have tried that route, it doesn't really pay unless you don't give much of a shit about what the final product looks or sounds like.",

The ones with to many fingers aren't really being seen as much any more.\n\nThe current generation of Sora and such are good enough that we'll see plenty of videos make the front page this year before someone catches it. However it will be a numbers game of how many are created and how many are good enough. Keep in mind they will be dirt cheap to make this year also.\n\nThe *next* generation of AI models will be trained on the Sora models and this very sub's reaction. \"The hair moves weird\" \"there is no reflection in that stream\" will just slowly train the models to fool us. It takes about 6 months and hundreds of millions of dollars of compute to make a world class AI this year and the last. However they are getting better and better at training it and finding out the weird blind spots.\n\nSo my bet is that not only is this the year that we get Dreamworks/Pixar level movies for the low thousands and a lot of really good photorealism, but we'll have AI use things like Unreal Engine to make videogame cut scenes that never exist.",

Look up some culture magazine articles from that era and you'll find tons of opinion pieces raging against photography and how it'll put all artists out of a job.

            "> the right solution is to limit the number of posts users can make.\n\nThis is already being done, not just at the subreddit level but globally across all of reddit. If someone rapid-fires a bunch of submissions, say 5-10 over the course of a few minutes, reddit's spamfilter is going to flag that for review and pull it. And we videos mods already have rules in place for self-promotion. This limits the number of posts you can submit from your own channel. This has been a thing since the beginning of the subreddit.\n\n>  What you are really trying to curb is low quality videos,\n\nWe've been trying to do that since day 1. :) Just about every rule we have was specifically enacted to increase the quality of submissions in the subreddit. \n\n> your first problem is that you're going to get false positives\n\nFortunately, this isn't our first rodeo. False positives happen with nearly all of our rules. Things get better as we fine-tune, and become more educated and more experienced. Nothing we do is permanent. If we have a false positive, we can pull it out and reinstate the submission, or the user can resubmit if they'd like, no harm done. \n\n> which is going to piss off the people who have posts removed\n\nIt can't be worse than removing a submission for violating our 'No Politics' rule. Those pissed off people claim we're shills for the democrats and republicans, threaten to doxx us for ruining their free speech, claim we're lizard people furthering the goals of the illuminati, etc etc etc. I've had a few witchhunts & attempted doxxing come my way some years back. It's not fun, I don't recommend it. \n\n>  As the technology improves, you're going to have an even harder time\n\nThat presumes the technology to detect AI videos stagnates and doesn't improve.

But this thing? We gotta figure it all out all over again, because rather than pulling back and asking if building new nuclear plant power setups purely to run data centers is even smart or necessary, we're like \"yeah, this way we're doing it? brute forcing the video? that's the way to do it.\" But it's not! There are about fifty smarter ways to do this that could use AI! You could, and here I'm literally just spitballing, have it generate a good, photorealistic 3D human model, with a knitted cap over his spaceman uniform. Then generate a spaceship 3D model. Only one necessary, just has to be generated so that it can be shot from any angle. Then you just have to model the camera and sky and ground, and you're ready to go. Now, is this as sexy as spending the power output of a small nation to just brute force the video into what you want? No, not at all. It's not sexy because it doesn't leapfrog the existing tools, and more importantly, *the human knowledge*, the expertise that film school and experience creating films beats into you. So instead, you get stuff like...this. Which is expensive to make, and cannot consistently even resemble something viewable without humans intervening to make the most egregious errors happen out of the viewable frame. It's really good at creating high resolution hallucinations without any of the consistency, or more importantly just basic artistic craftsmanship and rules of thumb that so many dilettantes don't even know exists. Rules that exist for good reasons, and can only be credibly broken by knowing why the rules exist, and this cool trick you just thought up for how to break it without the audience perceiving what rule you broke, but realizing you just did something really cool. It's like writing a story with a twist--you have to earn it, a twist ending is a fundamental betrayal of some of the basic rules of writing a narrative, but a really good one breaks those rules because it *earns* it. AI does not understand those rules, and doesn't understand the basics of \"how to frame a shot\". It is assembling all this heuristically from seeing lots of video, but ultimately it cannot know what it is doing, or why, and thus when it fucks up, it doesn't know why it fucked up or even that it did. Try explaining to someone managing a creative project of any kind that this is how they're going to get work done, and they will laugh at you. I have spoken with creative directors who started using AI generated stuff for just roughs, or concept art, and were absolutely baffled at how inept the people creating it for them were when it came to the idea of \"everything the same except this one bit, change this one bit.\" That was an unreachable goal for them, but it's a basic, table stakes expectation of every creative director alive today no matter what media they work in.\n\nThere are much better uses of AI than trying to brute force the creation of the video itself, and that's probably where the most successful AI tools will end up. They will enable existing professionals. What I've seen of generative AI like this makes me think we'll ultimately call it a dead end. Too expensive for what you get, too wasteful in that you can't, absolutely cannot say \"You're 95% there, just re-create this so the headgear is consistent\" without apparently investing billions if not trillions of dollars in new hardware and infrastructure.\n\nGenerative AI is the brochure your timeshare company used to sell you on the place. The actual AI tools professionals end up with will still be the guy repairing your leaky basement faucet in the Timeshare As It Exists And You Experience It, which is ultimately not like it was in the brochure.\n\nGenerative AI, shit like Sora, will not be something we end up seeing on screens we care about. It's what will be creating the short ads we all ignore on ATMs, gas pumps, and Hot Topic store displays across the nation, though.

But, I also wouldn't be surprised if some of the cuts there are humans editing AI generated scenes. \n\n\nThere's also a huge amount of other fundamental flaws shown in that same release. Like the one showing a futuristic African city, is a great demonstration of how these are just frame to frame pixel consistency generators. Just like with the text variants, all they actually do is produce the statistically most likely next frame, with a random element on top. There is no concept of 3D space built into them, so they will just place new images into the same space that had something different there before.

It's only as good as the data it's fed and cannot \"feed itself.\" Still needs to be trained and not in the human sense of trained. We think it's like Ultron just scanning the entire internet and learning from it intelligently but we're sooo far out from Ultron. \n\nAs an aside, for example the videos sora has made takes massive, massive amounts of memory and processing power.

That's between 1 day and 1 week worth of man-hours, depending on how detailed you get.\n\nMaking a non-trivial indie game can very quickly get to a man-year of work \u2014 and that's when you're using things like Godot. For an average modern AAA-level game, you'd be looking at anywhere between man-century and man-millennium of work.\n\nJust by the amount of work you need to perform, the leap from images and text to full-on video game is massive. But it gets even worse.\n\nDrawing an image is relatively easy\u00b9, and so is training an AI model that whips out an image for you. There's untold amount of images online for you to train on. Text is even easier \u2014 ChatGPT is pretty much just an advanced form of text prediction. \n\nThere's a reason video and music were third and fourth things AI got somewhat right.\n\nBut video games need, assuming you want to go beyond basic 2D platformers that very few people actually want to play ~~gee I've just painted myself a big target on my back for this one, haven't I?~~:\n\n* 3D models\n\nThere's considerably less 3D models out there than text, images, videos, and music. At the same time, 3D modelling is exponentially more complex than drawing an image. Then you have to texture your model (you have texture textures, and then you also optionally want normal maps so your models don't need to have 5 billion polygons\u00b2 to look good). Then, depending on the kind of game you want, there's also rigging the model and creating animations \u2014 which, okay, animations can be procedural, so this should be easy enough for AI. But still.\n\n* Levels\n\nProcedural generation has been a half-meme for literal decades at this point. There are games that use it, but we've discovered time and time again that hand-crafted worlds are better, and that procedural generation often leads to a boring game with a very few exceptions\u00b3 where procedural generation, more often than not, isn't exactly load-bearing.\n\n* Code (that runs fast)\n\nThere's not much code for games floating around, so it's a bit hard to train AI on that. Additionally, it's very easy to write some code that runs, or even does what you want it to. It's a bit harder to write many scripts and functions that work together in order to give the desired result, and harder still to write something that runs fast.\n\nI use Tab9 at work, and have used it for the past few years. At the current pace, things look a long distance away from actually doing my work for me, because at the end of the day \u2014 it's just fancy text prediction, trained on code.\n\n* You need to integrate this shit together\n\nEven if we get to a point where stories written by ChatGPT aren't shit, and even if we get a generative AI that can do 3D models with rigging and animations \u2014 all these assets need to be combined together in a way that works.\n\nIt's one thing to write a story. It's one thing to write a quest system. It's one thing to write a piece of code that can move character around on a map.\n\nConverting the story into a set of levels (that are playable), quests or goals, and figuring out how actions carried out by your character affect the goals?\n\nYeah. The field of AI may figure that out at some point in the future, but it's by no means\n\n> So yes, it's coming fast.\n\nYou mean, just like self-driving cars are coming fast? When Google came out with their self-driving cars, everyone was saying that self-driving cars will be here \"in a few years\", and that truckers will be out of the job before 2020 or something.\n\n* You still can't buy a self-driving car.\n* Waymo is impressive, but ultimately still short of what people expected self-driving cars to be.\n* Tesla is even worse. Look at the history of Elon saying when Tesla will have full self driving figured out. Hint: they still don't.\n* For all the talk about how self-driving trucks are going to upend the trucking industry and make millions of people unemployed and unemployable, very little progress has been made on this front\n\n>  I'm being downvoted by programmers in denial about the future of their employment.\n\nYou're being downvoted by people who are best equipped to know the limitations of AI, and the extent of work required to make a video game? A large portion of programmers are aware of AI tools that write all the code for you, and decent portion use them. We can tell that we're looking at a self-driving car situation _at least_ when it comes to the 'AI that writes all the code for you' part.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n[1] Not really but _in comparison_.   \n[2] That's hyperbole. Even 3D models of minis for 3D printing can often look good enough with only ~1-2M, and if you're going for a stylized/low-poly look you could concievably get away with a lot less.  \n[3] Yes I know Minecraft and the likes exist. The only reason Minecraft isn't boring is because the whole draw of that game is \"imagine you had unlimited lego pieces and the area larger than the surface of the sun to place them.\" Same goes for games like Payday \u2014 you have procedural generation to mix up hand-crafted rooms that can sometimes appear in different spots following a few very tightly-defined configurations. On the level from \"not procedurally generated\" and \"fully procedurally generated,\" games like Payday still sit very close to \"not procedurally generated\". For a more recent popular example, Lethal Company falls into the same bin as Payday: you have just enough procedural generation to keep things fresh, but it's kept on a very tight leash.",

We can't seriously expect it to have become fully mature in that time.\n\nThis is just a new modality for very old tech. Neural network approaches to associative learning is at least 50 years old by now. This appears to be the pinnacle of what we can achieve with this approach, given the entire worlds internet content for training, and thousands of underpaid third world workers sorting and labelling the data for training. This approach to learning is fundamentally limited by the available data, and we are reaching that limit now. You can't just increase parameter size without increasing dataset, because then you get into the realms of overfitting. \n\n> There's nothing inherent in AI as a technology that would prevent perfect (as in \"to human perception\") coherence in generated output.\n\nThere is, yes. The way the model works, as I said, is by predicting the next most likely frame, given the current sequence of frames, over some attention window. There is no understanding of objects, or 3d space, or cause and effect. \n\nThere is a very good hint that they are nothing like humans in the huge resources they require to be trained. Megawatts of power for one. See, with AI, everything must be prespecified, there is little computation or processing in the moment, except to access the prespecified networks built up with the worlds internet of curated and labelled data training. There is no ability to generalise or transfer learning. It only has what access to outputs that have in some way been prespecified by the training in a rigid way, with some random number generator sitting on top. \n\n> This much has been proven to be false. Analysis of the models as they work has shown that they produce internal states that map to 3-dimensional models of the 2-dimensional scenes they are rendering.\n\nNo, there hasn't been. All that can be shown is that within the higher dimensional vector space of an AI, certain directions can share commonalities. Like there might be a general direction that seems common to the idea of \"femaleness\" or something. But the thing is, the AI itself has no way to access that general concept of \"femaleness\", it's just that we can observe it in the network, and project meaning onto it. It can only access a particular vector direction, if it's given a particular input, that leads to a particular network being activated, that happens to contain that particular vector direction in it. Its outputs are therefore always purely circumstantial and specific to that prompt, any appearance of generalisation is just happenstance we as humans are projecting meaning onto. And this happenstance fails regularly, as in the examples I gave, revealing the pure frame to frame statistical prediction the model actually outputs, with no underlying general conceptual intelligence. \n\nThis inability to process information in a general way, while also specific to the moment, is the fundamental flaw in AI, and why it will never actually have any understanding of 3d space, object permanence, or any other general and transferable concept you can imagine. And by AI I mean the current neural network, weighted association type, learning. \n\nI'm a cognition and learning researcher. Happy to explain this stuff to you more.",

Look, it's clear you're not interested in talking, because you ignored my entire comment and tunnelvisioned down onto a partial sentence, and ignored the supporting argument around it.\n\nAttention is just an iteration on recurrent neural network approach, invented in the 90s, which itself was just a slight iteration on basic neural networks, invented in the 60s. There's nothing foundational being changed here, it's all just building on top of the same foundation.\n\nNow, this does not cover everything. AlphaGO, for example, tried new things, and avoided relying purely on deep learning at the foundation, instead, it was designed with a deep understanding of GO from the start. It had a conceptual description of the symmetries in Go built into it from the get go, prior training. \n\nBut mostly, it's just deep learning neural networks, with different short term working memory approaches, and some modifications to training. There are really no new ideas to speak of here, just honing in on perfecting the existing ones, which we are at the limits of after 50 years. All there is to explore is new modalities within the pure deep learning paradigm.\n\npeople in ML who have no understanding of human cognition get carried away with thinking that these things are like humans. I see it a lot. But it's an excitement only based on an ignorance of modern cognitive science. A very basic and age old example, is deep learning neural networks have no way to learn time intervals between events in the way we know humans can.",

You're presupposing your own conclusion by setting the limits of the conversation as such. I've talked about the fundamental constraints on deep learning in general, and how they are also apparent in Sora. This is the key reason why I say it's not new technology, because these fundamental flaws can be traced throughout, and have not been solved.

            "My grandma is 90 years old with early dementia. She wanted to get new gutters and wanted the independent choice rather than allowing my mom to work with the contractors, so she got LeafGuard gutters. Her house is basically a square with 2 gutters, each around 50ft. They charged her $20,000 for the work. Compare this to my house that has a very complex gutter arrangement without gutter guards and I paid $3000 for our first set of gutters and $4000 for the second set after years of inflation.",
            "\"The buy today only discount\"... yeah, never do business with anyone offering that. Sleezy salesmen 101 sales tactic to create false urgency and pressure you to sign before you have time to think or research. LeafGaurds are also trash and a waste of money.",
            "I tried to get a Leafguard reseller to give me an estimate over the phone.  I just wanted to know the ballpark if it was even reasonable to consider.  They insisted there was \"no way\" to estimate without a site visit.  I said \"It's 200 linear feet in 3 sections, 4 downspouts\", they said \"there's a lot more to it than that\".  so I asked \"what is the per foot cost of just the gutter\" and again \"we don't price it that way\"\n\nso I had them come out, took a day off work, and the guy measured and handed me a quote that said \"200 feet, 4 downspouts:  $30 per ft\".  total was almost $6000\n\neven if they weren't gut punchingly overpriced, I wouldn't have done business with them just for jerking me around on estimating.",
            "Leaf Guard and similar seem very dodgy to me. You can get your gutters cleaned every year for the rest of your life for a fraction of what they are charging people for some plastic or wire screens that don't really do much to solve the clogging problem.

            "We got the EasyOn Gutter Guards from Costco for our house. I think I spent like $300 in total for all of the guards. Went right on top of my existing gutters. They work great. However, you DO have to make sure that you bend the screen material according to your roof pitch. There is a guide to tell you how much. And you do have to sweep them off once a year. They even gave us a free stiff bristle brush for cleaning them off. The big gotcha is valleys. I used some flashing to create some diverters so that they water funneling down the valleys would divert to either side of the gutter instead of overwhelming the screen material and flowing over them. It's not perfect, but it works good enough. They do sell diverts specifically for this problem, but they seemed rudimentary enough for me to fabricate my own. Highly recommend the guards from Costco, and I can't believe LeafGuard charges thousands for something you can do for hundreds on your own. Straight up highway robbery.",

A couple days later, he called and left a message for someone else who was apparently on his potential client list, which I thought was either inept or sketchy. The shit icing on the LeafGuard cake was when, about a week later, the salesman opened my front door and poked his head into my house, claiming he was on an estimate visit at another house in the neighborhood and wanted to check in with me.

            "I used to work for a company called Infocision who does customer service and sales for various companies. Some companies were nice to work for and others were awful. The one I absolutely despised was LeafFilter, and ultimately why I quit working there. Basically, whenever people would go in to Home Depot or Lowes or any other store like that, or online website, and show interest in any type of home improvement project, and that company would sell their info to LeafFilter. We would call these people within minutes of their contact and try to get them to set up a \"Free Gutter Inspection\" with them.\n\nThe only purpose this inspection had was to try and sell them the filters for their gutters. If people said they just wanted their gutters cleaned, or needed minor repairs, or anything really, we would tell them that we would send someone out to discuss it with them. But literally the only thing that would happen would some dude would show up with a ladder, spend 5 minutes looking at the gutters, then take their big book of LeafFilter promo shit and try and hard sell these people, to make them commit to brand new filters (and gutters if possible) right on the spot. They use every trick in the book to try and trick these people in to spending thousands upon thousands of dollars for something that isn't worth 1/10 of what they are selling.\n\nThey will start off at some absurd price like 12k for all of it, then start pretending to come up with discount after discount (\"Oh it turns out we are doing a job nearby next week, bc of bulk pricing I can knock off 4k\" etc) to try and pressure someone in to committing.\n\nNow, my job was just to set this meeting, but it still disgusted me. I tried to switch clients but bc LeafFilter paid better than almost every other client we had they were a priority client so they refused. Thankfully I had gotten in to a position where I didnt need the job so I was able to eventually quit. A job I had had for a decade, with shitty client after shitty client, but LeafFilter was the company that broke me.\n\nLong story short, LeafFilter and all the companies like them are absolute scams and you should stay far far away from them",

They couldn't care less about the long-term quality of the gutters/system they are selling you, nor do they often know much about the industry or the product they are selling besides their memorized sales shtick. I was actually warned as a technician that I would likely encounter many situations like this, where sales people had lied or mischaracterized the product to the buyer. \n\nShowed up for repairs at an elderly couple's home that thought they had signed up for a Life Alert necklace type service from our company when the salesman had actually upsold them into a $7000 contract for monitored home security that they couldn't afford nor did they need (lived in a small rural community). Went to another lady's house and the previous technician hadn't connected the security components to the panel (all the wires were just hanging in the basement panel unattached to the system), imagine the lawsuit if someone had broken into her house. The worst was a guy who paid for a system on his new house before moving, had been charged for monitoring for a system that wasn't yet installed on his house for over a year and was still getting pushback when he asked them to come out and actually install the panel and components.

It wasn't LeafGuard, but some other company... Gutter Guys or something like that. Anyway, they were super-responsive to the request for an estimate, someone showed up like a day or two later. While getting a quote, I made sure to specifically ask them, \"*how much to get them taken off if I get a new roof, which is definitely going to happen in the next year or two?*\" I asked, because if the cost to remove then put them back was excessive, I was just going to wait to do the gutters at the same time as the new roof. To which they said, \"it's **a few hundred bucks**, pretty routine, our guys show up, take them off and stage them til' the new roof is done then come back out and put the gutter guards back on.\" \n\nWe got them installed and, as I had told the rep, we arranged to have a new roof installed the following year. So I called them up, told them the date of install and they said, \"no problem, we'll send out a crew a few days before.\" Perfect... then I got the bill -- $800. I called the company, spoke to the manager about the variance between what I had been told and what I was actually billed and his response was pretty amazing. He said, \"well, what did you expect, when you live in [town I live in] $800 IS a few hundred dollars.\"\n\nI never knew that \"a few hundred\" was a variable that fluctuated depending on my zip code.\n\nMy second favorite interaction with them was when the back/corner gutter was waterfalling during any rain what so ever, so I called them and it took them almost 2-months to come out and check it. At which point the dude comes off his ladder, looked at me and said, \"you had a bird nest in there\" like I was the one who put it in there and inconvenienced him. I specifically remembered there being a blurb in the sales pitch about their guards not allowing birds to nest in the gutters, when I asked him about that he just retracted his ladder and walked back to his truck without even acknowledging the question.

You are actually buying a \"Service\" from a company to install the product. \n\nSecond. your heuristics (What you think you know) on what you \"think it should cost\" is wrong. You have zero data as a homeowner on where the market is NOW. \n\nGet ATLEAST three bids. I know its a pain in the ass, but get at least three. Compare not only the price, but the Scope of Work they're quoting you.  the Low price guy will burn you 75% of the time, but you need him to gauge the rest of the field. \n\nQuotes over the phone are mostly a bad idea. Some things are easy, Gutters are lin ft horizontal, and x Down spouts for every Y ln ft.. take your measurements, and phone quotes might be good. Attics, if your house is old, might be simple to take width x length to get your house SQFT, and you know you have 6 inch of cellulose and want to bring it up to current code or DoE recommendations.  DO NOT BUY off a phone quote though, unless you like to live dangerously. Make sure that contractor drags his behind to your house and inspects the property, the project scope, and answers your questions. EVERY TIME someone buys from a phone quote, \"Something went sideways\" because of something the contractor didn't see/know. \n\nASK FOR REFERENCES. Ask who their vendors are. Not the customer they just installed. Hell, that guy doesn't know how good the roof is, it's only been on for 2 months. Call those vendors, ask how they are, do they pay their bills, are they a \"trouble\" customer? Something like Gutter Guard is one of many similar products. Ask the vendors who sell 3-4 versions of gutter guard what they think about it. (All Leaf protections has problems btw, whether it's screens, adhesion, or something else, I've sold a few)\n\nDon't pay more for a roofing warranty extended mfg warranty. There are MANY reasons why, and I had a few paragraphs about it. Just worry about the installer warranty. If they put it on right, the roof will outlive your occupancy of the house 99/100 times. \n\nAnd never paint your vinyl siding. \n\nI hope this helps you.",

The video above is \"heavy\" rain. there's a lot. A lot of water has \"A Lot\" of mass, which creates \"A Lot\" of inertia (these are scientific terms).

Lot of people putting a lot of effort instead of working. \n\nYou can go to Amazon, eBay, etc and find lots of bootleg ups/fedex clothing so you can appear like you work for a delivery service when you show up on a porch.",

            "Deterrence only works for non-criminals. You weren't a criminal, you were just looking for your jobs site. It's why the saying \"locks only keep honest people out\" exists. \n\nIt's been scientifically proven that more severe consequences don't prevent crime, it's the odds of being served those consequences that matter. Like the other guy said, these assholes know there's a 99.9% chance they're NOT going to get shot or receive significant consequences for their actions.",

            "This performance is equal part hilarious and cathartic, but it gets even better with context. Bo was having constant panic attacks on stage and AFAIK this was his last live performance before quitting for years up until resurfacing again with the amazing 'Inside' music special where we finally get the context of why he just vanished.\n\nIt requires a lot of talent and balls to just open up to a crowd like that in a comedy show and no one does it like him.",
