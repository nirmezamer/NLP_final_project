You're leader of the party that has accepted tens of millions of pounds from Russians, and who covered up the report into Russian interference into our elections.

            "Farage is like Trump, ANY publicity is good publicity. Notoriety and media coverage is the name of the game, harnessing the very considerable voting power of the stupid and bigoted. So he\u2019ll come out with statements pro Putin, anti NHS whatever he wants because we\u2019ll all be saying his name and his stupid face will be all over the news again.",

            "Whilst you may not agree with timing and wording of Farage\u2019s comments, can\u2019t be denied there\u2019s an element of truth to them.\n\nShould be asking Sunak where the money to fund the Ukrainian war effort is coming from whilst the pot is supposedly empty and millions in his own country live in poverty",

            "Yeah, far better it from me to gift Sunak and election strategy, but going all in on Farage being Putin's lapdog seems like low hanging fruit.",
            "Just in time for the election too!",
            "No, it is not about bollocks, he just has an angle on Farage now that he didn\u2019t before",

            "He has spent years cultivating an edgelord mentality as he\u2019s learned that is what worked for him in the past.\n\nIn way a similar to Putin, I think he\u2019s fallen for his own propaganda to an extent. Not 100% cold calculated comments, I think he really believes things now that he would have said was ridiculous 10 years ago.",
            "In this case: because the people they dislike are outraged by the things he says.\n\nAnd it doesn't even matter why \"they\" are outraged. Moral or political considerations don't come into it. It's all about identity and how people like Farage with their shallow populism can pretend to be \"one of us\" sticking it to \"them\" and consequently get away with just about anything. It's the same with Trump, who can say and do what he wants and his followers will excuse him because he openly intends to harm the people they have made themselves hate or fear.\n\nThat said, it's probably still a grievous miscalculation of him to say those things. The dynamic above only really captures the hard core of his supporters, and it won't help him convince anyone else.",
            "I honestly believe that Reform\u2019s support would be down by 5% if the country had better funding for mental health services.",
            "Mouth breathers who still think brexit was an intelligent thing to do",
            "Easy. People be thick and/or racist.",
            "Because he acts like he's outraged and he spits stuff out loudly, with absolute conviction (whether is the truth or not) and people think that's enough of a quality to make him trustworthy and a good leader.",
            "They target the average person who doesn't follow geo politics with policies that '' make sense''\n\nSuch as simply not sending billions to a foreign war, or simply putting' 'more Bobby's on the beat' to stop crime. When really the issues are alot more complex",
            "They're willing to forget or ignore the closeness between Farage and Arron Banks, a massive donor to leave and to UKIP, who met with Russian officials numerous times ahead of the Brexit vote, and also is close to Cambridge Analytica, which existed to literally manipulate people on social media.",
            "I was speaking to a reform voter earlier today and there's just nothing in their heads that will allow them deduction and reasoning skills.\n\nThey know the tories are bad but assume \"tha lot of them are jus as bad as eachutha\" and will leave it at that and then vote for the party that is tories on steroids as a \"protest\" vote.\n\nIt's beyond me too but I normally jump to being uneducated as an answer to how they could vote reform.",
            "I know a few (older) people who love him. They also love Trump.",
            "the painful part is this very same man has ALREADY spun lies to the detriment of the country as a whole for his own benefit\n\nhis manifesto... sorry... \"contract\"... is a load of shite too if you actually bother to read it but i suppose its unfair of me to expect anyone voting Reform to actually be able to read, the high concentration of lead behind their eyes probably makes it hard for them",
            "Straight away i want to say i obviously do not support the reform party or Farage.\n\nHowever....the reason people vote for Farage is because he heads the only party who want to reduce immigration and are believable and that's what gets all the 50+ old people rilled up.\n\nTories state they want to reduce it but arnt believable due to their track record on it.\n\nLabour don't care.\n\nLib dems don't care.\n\nIf there was a left wing party that stated they want to reduce immigration and where believable they would fly up the polls.",
            "Farage stirring the pot as usual. Controversy follows him.",
            "It's been setup, purposefully degrading labour and tories (internally and externally).\n\nFarage is not to be trusted, potentially even more so than Labour and Tories.\n\nThere are no good parties to vote for, on purpose.",
            "True. Though I'm sure there are some of his supporters that believe the same. I suspect a majority of them though may support some of his other views, don't support this one.\n\nHe's possibly just cost him self and his party what momentum they had.",
            "Feels like a Doctor Who plot tbf - political nobody goes to a prominent politician because of mass media and playing on emotions leading to some kind of nightmare timeline. \n\nWeirdly it happened in America but thankfully they've mostly recovered, although saying that, elections are soon.",
            ">How on earth could people vote for this guy.\n\nRemember Brexit and the money for nhs?",
            "For a man who built his entire persona around taking back control for Britain, it's remarkable that he thinks Russian interests should dictate British foreign and Defence policy.\n\nIt's also remarkable how many on the far right seem to agree.\n\nPeople often confuse nationalism and patriotism, but the truth is that while Farage and his lot might be nationalists, they're traitors to everything Britain stands for, simply because they don't think it should stand for anything.",
            "Because a lot of people don\u2019t take politics seriously and treat it with the same attitude as Reality TV Drama.",
            "Let\u2019s not forget this is a party that has members that think we should\u2019ve surrendered to Hitler, so I wonder what their policy would be if Putin came knocking.",
            "It's not Farage himself that is the problem. Put basically any of their candidates on the spot and ask them hard questions and they'll say something similarly thick, evil, or both. Farage has far more experience and skill than most at interview management.\n\nReform's achilles heel is that they are not a real political party. They don't have serious policies or platforms. They're effectively a pressure group for right wing voters to show discontent with the Tories for being the wrong sort of right wing, for one reason or another.\n\nFarage already admitted this was true of UKIP and the Brexit Party, and in time he will say the same about Reform once he's moved to his next platform (which is most probably the Tories themselves in my estimation)\n\nAsk them to criticise the status quo? They can do that easily. Anyone can, from a variety of angles. Actually tackle them as a prospective party of government? Nothing holds up, be it domestic policy, foreign policy, economics, workforce, public services... they are not a real political party and do not have real policies, just slogans and buzzwords.",
            "You think people who would vote for this fascist care about Russia or Putin?  It\u2019s all about \u201cTake back control!   Deport them dark skin people!  Rule Britannia!  Control our borders!\u201d",
            "If mainstream politicians are too scared to discuss issues like Brexit, Israel, Ukraine, then politicians with little to lose will happily.\n\n2 party politics is the worst possible option for everyone but career politicians.\n\nStarmer will win and he's a nothing.",
            "> Nigel Farage.\n> \n> How on earth could people vote for this guy.\n\nMaybe because he seems like a wild card? He is always breaking the mold. He got Brexit done. Got debanking done and probably now, got election done? Literally everyone that went against him, lost...",
            "Just you watch mate.",
            "I\u2019m voting for him because I can read past the media\u2019s skew on what he said.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine anyone caring about what these other lying pricks from the main parties have to say at all, that\u2019s what I would call inept.",

            "Farage is right. He said the truth.",
            "Give me a better option.",
            "He is right on so many issues, then he says something stupid like this and makes himself completely unelectable.",
            "To be fair, Farage also directly attacks the NHS so it's on brand for him really.",
            "He wants to destroy the system and turn it to his advantage, via populism. But the Tories also run the country in their interests  not those of the people.",
            "He would probably say the NHS provoked Russia. He hates it anyway and wants to sell it off to his rich backers.",
            "He literally didn\u2019t support Russia\u2026 he just correctly guessed the war would happen because of NATO expansion in the east.\n\nPlease people, stop believing the media skew on what people say, just ignore it all!",
            "You can bring up all these tenuous links. But at the end of the day he has overseen very hard policy against Russia and for Ukraine",
            "Farage's private bank account needed topping up didn't it?",
            "No he wasn't. This figure has long since been disproven. He earned a total of 500k for all media appearances while he was an MEP, the vast vast majority of which came from his show on LBC rather than from his very occasional RT appearances. He took 10x more money from LBC and Fox News, does that means he'll do what they tell him? Come on.",
            "And the conservatives haven't?",
            "About as true as Corbyn\u2019s supposed connections to Czech intelligence - fun if true, but sadly not true.\n\nBasically, disinformation.",

            "Why would nato do this?",
            "I'm curious to hear, what's your take on the leaked diplomatic cables from 2014 where US assistant secretary of state Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador to Ukraine were recorded in the process of hand-picking the next Ukrainian president in order to ensure a pro-western leadership in Ukraine?\n\nArticle about that leak - [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26079957](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26079957)\n\nAnd if you don't see any relevance to the content of that leak, I suggest doing some research on just how influential Victoria Nuland is behind the scenes in US government, and also looking at her equally influential husband Robert Kagan who's written various highly regarded foreign policy books on the importance of nationbuilding and spreading US influence around the globe.",
            "Hell will freeze over, thaw and then freeze over again before Rishi Sunak gives a compelling speech. But he could at least try and achieve something approaching useful before he and his party fade into blessed irrelevancy for the next 5 years.",

            "Farage is more popular than sunak so can't see that being very effective",

            "Haha simplifying issues is talking about how wider geological issues might affect Putins decision making but claiming the invasion was purely down to insane mad man Putin is not. Ok.",

            "Why?   He's repeating something he said before... Also something he said in 2014 about the possibility of war.  It's nothing new.",
            "No. That's just some nonsense pro-russia accounts say. Putin has repeatedly said that Ukraine is part of Russia, and is reclaiming it. It has nothing to do with NATO.",
            "I may be wrong but Putin did say that if Ukraine was to be part of NATO and or EU he would see it as a threat as the west is getting too close to Russia.",
            "No. Russia invaded originally to seize a warm water port in Crimea. Then they did a full invasion because tiers of corrupt yes men told Putie that they could easily win an invasion.",
            ">Did Russia invade Ukraine because they applied to join NATO?\n\nThat's a more nuanced question than you may think. Possibly...\n\n1. Putin was genuinely worried that NATO is an aggressive threat to Russia and so invaded Ukraine to keep it out of NATO and EU reach.\n2. Putin wants to expand Russia to gain back the buffer states it had during the Soviet Union period and used NATO/EU (largely peaceful organizations) as an excuse for making another move against Ukraine.\n3. Something else entirely.\n\nMy money is on 2. But whatever, the answer to your question is likely to be 'yes' (or at least it 'yes' to Ukraine might have joined NATO and/or the EU). Whether that was a genuine fear response on Putin's part, or just an excuse to go empire building is another question.",

That's all they have, and they've milked the vaccine card to death so now they're trying to look tough on Ukraine. Considering Nigel Farage said he'd support the conservatives literally a week before he announced he'd be running as Reform leader, and then suddenly his pro-putin sympathies are all over the news, I wouldn't be surprised if this is an inside job and Farage is the fall guy.",

Anything which involves a gain of territory is a win. \n\nYour own argument has fallen apart. You have said Russia is in a state, but that Russia cannot lose? Which is it?",
            "Yeah, I'm not saying that Ukrainians can outright win the war. Neither side are capable of combined armed breakthrough offensives. If Ukraine get properly mobilised, dug in and armed, which they are none of currently, they will be essentially undefeatable by Russia without an enormous escalation of the war by Putin which, would be politically unfeasible. Currently Putin is fighting with a volunteer army and is far away from a war economy, so the war doesn't affect the average Russian much yet. \n\n The current scale of the war is not that anyone is going to run out of men. Likely casualties are in the low hundreds of thousands for both sides. Ukraine estimated 500000 for Russia, which you can assume to be exaggerated, and of course some casualties return to fighting. The issue for Ukraine in terms of manpower has been that its mobilisation has been a joke. They seemed to believe their own info war that Russia had been defeated.\n\nThe russian strategic campaign to win that way long term is unlikely to work either IMO. Just too much Western financial support is flooding into Ukraine and history has shown its very hard to break the will of a country by destroying civilian infrastructure etc.\n\nI think it will likely end in some sort of Korea style Armistice, which is pretty much a W for Ukraine in that it would retain its political independence, while Russia has completely fucked itself long-term for absolutely nothing. Putin will likely try to push for as much Donbass territory as possible so he can declare victory, but if he stops being able to make even these very small incremental gains it's probably over. \n\nA current ceasefire at Ukraine's likely lowest point would be irrational IMO because currently it would amount to a capitulation given Putin's demands. You could make an argument for Ukraine taking a ceasefire in 2022 though when it was in a very good position. I know Steven Kotkin has made that argument.",

They have a good quality of life working a basic job on \u00a330k pa.\n\nThey are far richer than a \"higher earner\" from a younger generation paying a fortune to rent a one bedroom flat. \n\nThe socialists like to drum up hatred and use illogical arguments to do so.

We cannot keep abusing the most productive in society. We need a fair tax system and control over unskilled and criminal migration.\n\nPeople will continue to vote with their feet. I am one of them and hope to be in a position to leave the UK in less than two years.\n\nWe are marching ever leftward to a socialist paradise. I do not intend to be here for that.",
            "I mean when you cut taxes in general the 10% who pay 60% of taxes would benefit unless you think the 10% should pay more. I think the Policy in an ideal world if we could save elsewhere would work fine but yeah funding it is where it's iffy",

            "Something needs to be done ASAP. It is actually shocking me how blatant it is we are approaching a crisis, how serious that crisis seems set to be, versus how little interest there seems to be in doing anything about it. I don't think I've even heard it mentioned in any of the debates I've watched yet. I used to be an academic, I left months ago as working conditions are just intolerable in the system now. I've moved to doing sales for stuff where university research is a fairly large customer and every single contact and project I am hearing oh whoops sorry our budgets just been cut, the university is in deficit to the tune of tens of millions etc. And this is coming from science teams working at top-ranked universities, its not the media studies team at Uni of Blackburn who are suffering as everyone just seems to assume.\n\nE - Also to add its been put aside for so long, its difficult to know what the solution is. Raising tuition fees in line with inflation, we'd be looking at somewhere between a 30 to 50% increase in fees. I doubt many people would be happy with that. Just another poison chalice the Tories are handing to Labour I think.",
            "(Article)\n\n---\n\nA Labour government should take immediate steps to stabilise the UK\u2019s university system, raising the annual \u00a39,250 tuition fee in line with inflation, the head of the sector\u2019s main lobby group has said.\n\nVivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, which represents more than 140 universities, said if Labour wins rapid action would be needed to avoid the sector being left in limbo as the new administration beds in.\n\n\u201cThe worry is that there is an 18-month review process that delivers no substantial change for two or three years. We\u2019d argue for a two-step approach: do something to stabilise the ship, then address the question of more fundamental changes,\u201d she told the Financial Times.\n\nLabour said in its election manifesto that higher education was \u201cin crisis\u201d and that the current funding settlement did \u201cnot work for the taxpayer, universities, staff, or students\u201d, but has failed to provide details of how it would address the problems if elected.\n\nThe sector is battling financial headwinds caused by a sharp decline in international student fees and a decade-long freeze of domestic tuition fees.\n\nThe cap on fees means universities are losing an average of \u00a32,500 on every domestic student, according to analysis by the Russell Group of leading research universities. \n\nMore than 50 universities have announced job cuts and closure this year and several are on the verge of bankruptcy, according to Whitehall insiders.\n\nStern said three immediate steps were required to stabilise the system. These were a backstop mechanism to avoid university insolvency; clear signals to international students that they were welcome after recent hostility from the government; and a decision to raise student fees and maintenance loans in line with the retail price index.\nShe added that the short-term measures would create financial and political space for a wider review of university financing, including changes to the loan repayment system that would take years to implement.\n\nBridget Phillipson, shadow education secretary, has signalled that Labour is preparing to address the challenges of the UK\u2019s higher education system. \n\n\u201cLet me be clear that reform is coming,\u201d she said in a speech to the UUK annual conference in September, adding that \u201cstudent finance will be the first to see change, although by no means the last\u201d. \n\nEducational experts said the options for Labour, which has a 20-point lead according to polls, included reversing recent changes to the loan repayments system that landed hardest on women and lower-paid professions, or restoring real interest rates to student loans.\n\nMore radical policies include \u201cstepped repayments\u201d, which would mean higher-earning graduates pay significantly more over their working lifetime than they borrowed in students loans.\n\nOne former university vice-chancellor said the fact that Labour had acknowledged the sector was \u201cin crisis\u201d indicated that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and Phillipson, who have not ruled out a tuition fee, were likely to act.\n\n\u201cThe short-term pain of putting fees could be blamed on the Tory inheritance . . . and then traded against a transition to a better deal for young people, which Lab can deliver before next general election,\u201d he said.\n\nNick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute think-tank, said he was sceptical of the case for radical reform, noting that the 1997 Dearing review, the 2010 Browne review and the 2017 Augar review had all stuck with a form of student loans.",
            "Presumably if you accept unis have to fund themselves, then tuition fees have to rise with inflation?\n\nOf course in my opinion HE should be heavily subsidised because it's handy to have plenty of doctors, engineers, scientists etc in society.",
            "Was at university during the tuition fee rise (thankfully had the ~\u00a33000 fees locked in) the attitude of the lecturers was that the new fees and removal of student cap would simply allow big universities to crush smaller and younger ones. \n\nMany were supportive of the current system, though only under the assumption that fees would keep rising each year. They wanted a \u201ccompetitive market\u201d\n\nThe government needs to start thinking about what happens when a university fails to meet its financial commitments, otherwise they will simply hold the government to ransom and demand massive bailouts. \n\nThere are already suggestions they have handed loans out to some universities to stay afloat (before COVID even). This just fuels the bubble",
            "Either tuition fees need to go up or the government grants need reintroducing.\n\nAs much as people don't like Uni fees, expecting them to do the same job they were doing in 2012 with 26% less money per student is stupid.\n\nFees were capped at \u00a39k in 2012. That's \u00a312,547 at today's prices.\n\nFees today are capped at \u00a39,250. There's a gap of \u00a33,297 per student per year in Uni funding that needs to be filled from somewhere. Either it comes from higher fees, higher grants, higher proportions of international students or cuts to provision.",
            "Most universities are entirely dependent on foreign students mainly from China to support them. The \u00a39000 per year tuition fee barely covers anything.",
            "How about instead of feeding the beast of corporate universities, we cut down some of the bloat, first? Do they really need vice-chancellors on \u00a3100k+? Do they really need sub-committee after sub-committee, all with its own budget? Are they really providing value for money, when a lot of students are lucky to get time with their lecturers?\n\nDo universities really need to raise tuition fees, with the rip-off that is student housing on top of that? Could I get a discount for just distance learning instead?\n\nThey need to seriously reform their business model before they go asking for higher tuition fees.",
            "Sad what has happened to Universities. The rot started in the 1960's when Labour changes the Advanced Technnogy colleges into Universities, made worse by the Tories in the early 90's when they did the same to the Polytechnics.\n\nBlair then put it on steroids when he got in saying that he wanted 50% of people to be graduates.\n\nThe status and value of a University education has been so debased by this proliferation.\n\nIt is just an industry now that is unreformable because the bureaceacy has become too big and poweful.\n\nI will be strongly urging my kids to get into an Engineering apprenticeship, opens so many more opportunities and won't be saddled with lifelong debts.",
            "Absolute nonsense. Universities have devalued themselves by inflating their numbers of international students who do not meet the admission requirements.\nMany many Chinese students cannot communicate in English - and have to use translation software for lectures? So they have somehow got them through the admission process despite not meeting the language requirements. It's an absolute joke.",
            "im sorry but if your institute can't get by with over 155 million a year just from tuition fees. It should close down...\n\n2,862,620 students in the UK as of 2021  \n166 UNI's in the UK  \n17,244 students on average per UNI  \n\u00a3155,202,289 a YEAR in student fees to each UNI.\n\nThis doesn't take into account the foreign students who are paying a fuck ton more than 9000 a year.\n\nSeriously fuck off. So much bloat... The majority of lectures involve some crusty fuck using the same power point slide they have used for the last 5-10 years. It could just be a recording.\n\nYou have a spending issue. Cut back on shit. Focus on the students",
            "I think we'll see start to see some Universities fold within the next year or two.\n\n\nA lot of smaller ones are reliant on overseas students and that's drying up. Particularly from China where students just don't want to come to the UK as much due to the hostile environment they face here compared to places in Europe where they are welcomed",
            "Raising tuition is ridiculous, \u00a39000 is more than enough to deliver what most courses constitute,  in fact Covid showed you could make so many savings if you actually put in the effort, like only doing new lectures once every 3 years and having them pre-recorded.\n\nThe problem with the universities (having just finished a course ) is the ridiculous bloating of the university staff and quite frankly ridiculous spending on resources. It's honestly like bloated software at this point.\n\nThey have so many unnecessary staff and components that you could completely axe without affecting course delivery at all, we don't need 1001 officers of every description, some of whom are on exceptional salaries even though they are almost valueless additions.\n\nA blatant example of this is at the start of my course there were no 24hr security onsite at the bar and then they got brought in. Which is fair enough but we'd always had bar nights before that which were fine, then it got changed again that if we wanted to have a bar night we had to hire an external security company who'd send like 4 people to essentially stand around doing nothing because it was very tame and it cost \u00a34000 a night.\n\nSo we went from no security and having bar nights be fine, then having onsite security and bar nights be fine, then having to hire additional external security for bar nights even though there was never a single security issue on any of our bar nights.\n\nSomeone needs to go through each university with a fine tooth comb and cut all the ridiculous crap out of them, if you do want to have some ancillary services, then they should be grouped up and run centrally so like each department doesn't have a 1000 and one separate people doing the same thing.\n\nThe universities will never do it though, its a grift and jobs for the boys (and girls). The chancellors have to imagine they are steering these behemoths to justify their own quite often considerable salaries.",

Universities pivoted to accommodate that, and now they're being punished for it.",

I do get more contact time (usually around 15 hours per week, although some courses do have around 5 hours) but lectures are just people reading off a PowerPoint and labs are just a worksheet to complete. The small amount of data I've seen on exam pass rates shows about 1/3rd of students getting below the 40% pass mark in the January exams, I imagine largely because the teaching quality isn't incredible, class sizes are pretty huge compared to the number of teachers, and of course a fair number of students just not turning up to teaching (primarily the international students). I think the course could easily be taught in 1-2 years if there were reasonable standards for who gets in. \n\nI reckon the best route is to put more government funding into universities to cover inflation, but also increase the required standards for uni courses so the people incapable of actually passing with a reasonable grade don't get on, and reducing the number of \"mickey mouse degrees.\" It's probably more fair to the students as well - if they're not going to pass the course and get the degree, going to uni is really just a massive waste of money.",

            "First year is meant to have some overlap and lay a consistent foundation to raise the average level of the cohort to avoid attrition later. By design it is easier for stronger students and harder for weaker students.\n\nThen 12 contact hours does not mean 12 study hours. Each contact hour should be met with multiple hours of self study in the form of tutorial questions, assignments, revision. The whole credit structure depends on it. Combining even 2 years into 1 would see you working absolutely insane hours during large parts of the year (again, this is if you are engaging with the course content as designed).\n\nFinally, university should mould a lot of skills that might be missed by straight entering the work environment. Critical thinking and technical fundamentals are very easily missed in fields like STEM without going to uni. It takes time to develop and nurture those skills alongside the knowledge.",
            "That\u2019s possibly true, but there\u2019s always this idea that if we send fewer people to uni they\u2019ll magically transfer to the trades, and I just don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true.

We want to treat them like just another business but what other business has to provide: Suitable accommodation for thousands to tens of thousands on a constantly shifting annual basis, groundskeeping cleaning and maintenance of usually several fairly top-end facilities, waste disposal for all manner of horrible chemical and biological shite, food drink and other social facilities for people to socialize and enjoy, a range of pastoral care and personal development support, careers support and interaction with established companies to get them to take on untested and salaried workers for placements etc. etc. \n\nI mean on running costs alone, I won't name them as I don't want to dox myself but the last university I worked for as a postdoc, their bill *just* for gas and electric was nearly \u00a320m last year. \n\nAs I said in my first comment as well don't underestimate research fees. A lot of universities when I was a student geared themselves up to focus more on research than teaching undergrads as it was still a viable way to make money. Now it is nothing but a net drain. If I won a \u00a31m grant, the university has nothing to celebrate, it now suddenly has to find an extra \u00a3200k that was not budgeted for and with how all the administration and bureaucracy of everything seems to be nowadays might have had as little as a month to prepare for that before the academic is going to start spending those funds. \n\nI'd also add the structure of academia itself is self-defeating. Until you are quite far into your career you're only ever on temporary fixed term contracts. At most these are 3, very rarely 5 years. But most academics will tell you of their experiences of having to juggle 6 month contracts lol. This means there is *constant* turnover. As an academic you might be the only person in your department who really knows how to use a specific bit of kit, but that can extend to being responsible for running an entire lab or even facility. But there's no security for you, the university makes it clear they cannot afford to retain you permanently, so when you're gone... All those expertise vanish and suddenly the university might be sat on millions of pounds of capital investment that it now basically can't get any use out of. \n\nI could rant about this stuff forever sorry lmao. Its like the NHS, it is genuinely so hard to convey to people who haven't worked in the sector just how *utterly fucked* the entire thing is from top to bottom.",

            "I think one thing people don't appreciate as its changed so much in the last 7 or 8 years is how many more students now also work while studying. If you made all courses 30 hours of contact time a week, a lot of students just wouldn't be able to afford it. For most the loan *just about* covers rent and nothing else. In my day loan week was always when people were going out partying, getting tattoos, taking little trips etc. Its all just so much more brutal nowadays, there's zero breathing space.",

            "That is the problem. \n\nBut it is what universities have to do. They are judged on \"student happiness and enjoyment\" like some stand up comedy. And the easiest way to make students happy is to pass everybody. \n\nThe drop in standards was inevitable when student feedback was introduced as a way of ranking universities - the literature is very clear that exactly this happens every time you let students judge the quality of something they do not understand.",

Most econometrics and second and third year micro and macroeconomics modules (the foundation of an economics degree) are not easy but could be stripped back to make them less mathematical.
