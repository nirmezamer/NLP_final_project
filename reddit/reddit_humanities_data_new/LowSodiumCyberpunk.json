Would looked awful on third person driving camera, also we sprint and jump like psycho, the clothes physics would be funky.\nAlmost every single clothing in the game are designed to fit with each other, so shirts won't clip with jacket or pants. For example some modded shirt will just clips out of base game jacket, modded glove will just floats if you pull out the mantis blade.\n\nThe workload to add 200+ more clothes that will fit with each other would be massive, and they got a game to fix first.

As goofy as rolled sleeves looked, that's the reason why they auto-roll up the sleeves.\n\nCan't wait for the next gen Unreal 5 dynamic adaptive sleeve rolling mechanic in the sequel \ud83e\udd1e",

That feature didn't move any game innovation needle but I really love tiny little features like that, more personalization is always welcome.\n\nJust hope that CDPR factor in more neat little 'pointless' mechanics like that in the sequel, something like looking in the mirror and making facial expressions in 2077, one of my favorite feature in first person game."
