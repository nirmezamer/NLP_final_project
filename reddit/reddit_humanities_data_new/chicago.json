            "I did the sheets trick, too. Only had A/C in the living room. Lucky for me the 20's courtway apartment already had a place to hang them, as it was the style to have valances between rooms until the 50's. I had to teach the cat how to move the sheet. She wasn't too pleased with the heat. I explained to her many times that her mommy gave her the fur coat, not me.",
            "Neighbors camping out on the parkways overnight, hydrants perpetually open, lots of ambulances.  Also the summer I finally bought a window unit a/c - had happily lived without for years prior.",
            "I nailed up blankets in the dining room to block air access from the rest of the house and put the bed where the dining room table was. Us and the wall AC unit. The amount of sweat. Third floor.",
            "I was 8 when the heat wave hit. It was obviously the first time I had ever experienced something like that. My mom was in the hospital giving birth to my sister and my dad had my other sister and me at home. We had no a/c whatsoever. However, my mom had 3 high velocity fans, we did the blankets on the doorways and camped out in the living room. All 3 fans blowing on us each night. It's funny, I've never asked him about it, and maybe I should, I wonder how worried he was that he wouldn't let us out of his sight. Every night we all slept on the floor in the living room, I wonder if he slept at all that week.",
            "We had just moved here two weeks before it started. Our apartment had no air conditioning. We saw the forecast for the pending heat wave and ran to Sears (remember that place?) and bought a window unit for our bedroom, one of the last units remaining. We left our dog in the bedroom during the day when we went to work, then camped in there once we got home. That was some devastating heat!",
            "That year we had to sell pop for the cub scouts at the fest in our burb.  People were dropping like flies. One passed out right next to our tent.",
            "My best friend moved from India to Chicago that summer.  Although the term hadn\u2019t been invented yet, he was expecting a \u201chot girl summer\u201d.  Instead he got a \u201cgurl, this summer is too damn hot!\u201d  \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunately somewhat normal for people in India to die in extreme heat.  He wasn\u2019t prepared for 400 people to die from heat exposure in a temperate climate.",
            "I cannot recommend enough the book Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago, by Eric Klienberg.  A horrifyingly fantastic dissection of how everyone fucked up.",
            "It was early in my career, and I worked in the loop and had to wear a jacket and tie. Ugh, pure torture walking to the red line--my shirt collar was soaked by the time I got to the office.\n\nI lived on the third floor with barely working AC wall unit in the living room. My bedroom was like an oven.",
            "Lived around the corner from Bloomer Chocolate Factory in a loft with not many windows and no AC. It was over 100 degrees at night. The cockroachs in the loft gained flight. Never experienced that before or since. Fucking smelling Chocolate the entire time. That is a plane in Dantes's hell right there. I was a bit happy when I heard that the Factory was closing from that experience 30 years ago. I am repulsed by the smell of chocolate to this day.",
            "Being born lol",
            "Oh wow, I can't imagine how hard that must have been on your parents! It was a scary time.",
            "It\u2019s actually around 750 people that died from the heat wave.",
            "Over 700 people died that week. Nobody was prepared for that, unfortunately.",
            "And that\u2019s the official number. It\u2019s absolutely much higher."
