I bought two meager berry twigs a few years ago and the result is a massive bush in my planter and fresh berries daily for about a month.\n\nI love growing some of our food.",
            "I don't usually get excited about grocery hauls, since both my parents have to be on keto (the most expensive diet lol) for health reasons, but we cashed in credit card points for $100 Amazon gift cards, AND Amazon had a $20 off $100 that *stacked*, [so I got this haul for $43 dollars including tax and tip](https://imgur.com/a/oJjijDu). That's *eight* pounds of meat. If I make meatloaf, two batches of shredded crockpot chicken for salad and tacos, sloppy joes, and some sort of hamburger/rice casserole, I think I can make this last almost two weeks.",
            "My favourite frugal tip is to have a bucket list of all the birthday freebies I qualify for on my birthday month. I\u2019ve managed to get free ice creams, free drinks, free cake and free groceries which honestly felt AWESOME \ud83e\udd29",
            "My husband and I are trying our first \"no spend month\". We both recognize that we have let lifestyle creep get the best of us and we want to do this to save money, but more so as a reset. Has anyone else done one of these, any tips?",
            "My two challenges this month: no eating out. I usually treat myself weekly to a nice sushi dinner which easily ends up being around $40/ dinner. I want to challenge myself to none this month then keep it at a once a month treat.\n\n\nA/c challenge: I live in 'hotlanta\" . Currently 90 degrees. I run hot to begin with so I usually have my central air running alot..I looked at last months bill like \ud83d\ude11. Past few days what I've decided to try is run the a/c for a few minutes here and there once it gets a certain temperature and whatever room I'm in use my giant vornado fan right in front of me. I realized I'm just as cool if not cooler instead of using central air for my entire 1700 Sq ft. Condo..I'm excited to compare bills this month. Also tip for those who dont know: those blue cooling towels are a life saver . I use it while cooking in the kitchen if it's extra hot .\u00a0",

Today I cancelled several monthly subscriptions (including Amazon Prime) that save me now about $780/year! I went to TMobile to get their 2 week trial for ISP (it's $50/mo. vs $150 w/ Xfinity).  I hope it works!  Next on the chopping block is car insurance.",
            "Potentially dumb question. It's getting real hot where I am and I don't wanna turn on my central air. I'm using 2 box fans (one facing out the window, one on me). I'm considering getting blackout drapes for my bedroom but one window is basically taken up by the box fan, and I'd really only be blocking out 1.5 windows worth of light (lol). Should I just ditch the window box fan and use the blackouts? Or just do the combination?",
            "Not sure if this has been posted about yet, but it's burger kings birthday or whatever, the promotion started 5 days ago but there's two days left.\u00a0\n\n\nTomorrow you can get a free chicken sandwich and the next day, a free whopper junior. You only have to spend 70 cents to get the deals, which you can find in their app. I bought a small frozen coke for 99 cents to get the free stuff. (The app lists the price for a medium frozen coke on the drinks page which made me assume that it was the lowest price for one but when you click it, it offers small for cheaper, tho prob different prices everywhere).\n\n\nAlso on the main page of the app there's a rectangle about the bday game you can play, it's like popping balloons by movig your mouse or finger. It's not very complicated but it took me a while to figure it out lol. Luckily it's just play til you win, you can lose each level a million times but keep playing lol.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen you beat the game (which took me 10 minutes despite my confusion) you can get 400poibts which is enough to get a burger,\u00a0 sides, a bunch of things.",

            "I started one this month as well.  I try to do at least 3 a year.  With food, the key is to utilize your pantry/freezer first, buy what you need, and try to cook everything as it's far cheaper. I like to only shop sales and see what I can make from that. It's almost like a game to see how far it can go.  I try to make every meal provide at least a couple of lunches for the week, and freeze what's left so I have quick meals that I just need to defrost when I don't feel like cooking.  \n\nA no-spend month is a great way to reset your brain.  With the environment we live in these days I think we tend to forget the difference in needs vs. wants. I use the month to add what I \"want\" to shopping carts online and if I still want it when the month is over I'll purchase it, but 90% of the time I do not.",
            "I like to use, middle of the day, very humid or very hot days, and if I have to be rather physical that day.\u00a0\n\n\nTry to let air flow through in the mornings, to start day cooler, and evenings. Every window open then. Curtains prob shut sun midday. Those walkthroughs everyday, lol",

            "Nice, we aren\u2019t the sort of people who have a big freezer or a lot of pantry items, so our goal is just to buy only what we need. No meals out or take out. No coffees out, or other random splurges. I tend to meal prep for the work week anyway, but still forget one day a week or treat myself to breakfast on my way to work. I\u2019ve also gotten into the habit of buying my afternoon coffee out at a coffee shop, so these are the habits I\u2019m trying to change. \nIt\u2019s only been 3 days, but it\u2019s been fun so far kinda like you said seeing how far I can take it.",

If there is one thing wrong with it, like its a little too short or the sleeves are kind of weird, I won't buy it because I know I will find an excuse not to wear it. I need to know when I will wear it as well (is this for the office? For date nights? For church? For casual around the house?)

If not her then I go with my mom. \n\nSometimes you can get clearance clothes for as low as $5-$6 if you happen to be there on the right day. And I like that they\u2019re name brand clothes that I\u2019m already used to. Some that come to mind are Calvin Klein, Dolce and Gabanna (sometimes), etc. \n\nAll my coworkers compliment my work outfits, and when they ask me where I got my outfits from, I tell them Costco. \n\nCostco also currently has really nice linen pants, shirts and shorts, as well as packs of moisture wicking shirts (for those shirts, the brand is 32 Degrees). And they\u2019re SERIOUSLY saving me this summer by keeping me dry and surprisingly comfortable in this terrible heat. I especially like the linen pants because they keep me from being bit by mosquitoes. \n\nThrifting in my area is hit or miss, both in quality/brand and in price. But I also live in NY so that\u2019s just what it is, depending on your area. I\u2019d rather pay $10-$16 for a new shirt than wasting my time looking through racks full of Shein knockoffs and coming up empty handed. \n\nAlso if you buy clothes at Costco and then the price goes down (I think within the month that you purchased it) you can get refunded the price difference either in store credit or cash at the customer service desk.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to pay for a Costco membership, I\u2019ve heard you can just use their gift card to enter and purchase items with.",

            "You're going the wrong way.  Even if you stay within budget - which is very dubious in 2024 - you'll bump into your boredom factor very quickly anyhow, and destroy your health in the process.\n\nYou're eventually going to have to bite the bullet and learn to cook something - not necessarily anything involved, but *something* - for yourself.\n\nOne thing I do to alleviate the boredom & keep costs down (\\~$7 per day, give or take), is to cook 4-person meals and eat the leftovers... but I'll cook 2 of those per week and alternate the leftovers so I'm never repeating meals back to back.  There's no law that says you have to do it exactly that way, either.  Smaller meals with fewer portions, but more of them would give you a broader rotation.\n\nFurther advice:  Don't try to do this cold turkey.  Mix in your fast food deals and things like sandwiches or burgers made at home until you have the hang of it.  Budget alone will push you further into all-home-cooked territory, eventually.  I would even start with a simpler meal - breakfast or lunch, for example - and work out how to start eating that at home half the time, then all the time, then move on to another meal, that kind of thing.\n\nAs an example:  Chicken leg quarters are like 89 cents per pound if you buy the 10-pound bag.  I split that into 2 freezer bags until I need them, 4 or 5 legs each.  Fill the bag with salted (not warm) bouillon and let sit in the fridge for a day or two to brine & season (throw in whatever seasoning you like with the bouillon & salt).  Then pat dry with paper towels, brush with oil & roast on a foil-covered sheet pan at \\~400F for 25 minutes or so.  Get a leave-in probe thermometer for things like this. Chicken gets safe past 165F, but you can take it out around 160 and it will keep cooking on its own for a bit.\n\nYou can throw in a second sheet pan full of frozen vegetables (hearty ones like broccoli or carrots), straight from the freezer.  Coat them in olive oil & spices you like.  Add some mashed potatoes (even instant; very handy for cooking for 1).  You can do this relatively easily for 4 servings at once and now you have 3 chicken dinners ready for the microwave later in the week.  Cost under $3 per meal, closer to $2 depending on your veggie choices.  There will be extra expense at the start if you don't have a spice rack, oil in your pantry, etc., but it evens out quickly.",
