            "**Title: Remove the Modern Fishing Rod in Valheim: Bring Back Authentic Viking Fishing!**\n\nFellow Vikings of Valheim,\n\nValheim has captured our interest with its deep Viking lore and engaging gameplay. However, one element of most survival games seems out of place in the context of ancient Nordic culture: the modern fishing rod.\n\nIn historical accuracy and thematic consistency, Valheim has set a high bar. Yet, introducing a modern fishing rod feels like a jarring departure from the authentic Viking experience we've come to love. Let's take a moment to consider how Vikings fished:\n\n# Historical Accuracy Matters\n\nVikings were masters of the seas, relying on their wits and craftsmanship to catch fish for sustenance. They used simple tools and techniques that were integral to their way of life. Spears, nets, and handlines were common fishing tools among Vikings, crafted with the materials they had at hand \u2014 wood, bone, and sinew.\n\n# Why the Modern Fishing Rod Doesn't Fit\n\nThe addition of a modern fishing rod feels out of place in a world where authenticity and immersion are paramount. Vikings did not have access to such advanced tools; instead, they relied on their resourcefulness and skills honed over generations of seafaring.\n\n# Fishing Should Be a Day 1 Skill\n\nIn Valheim, survival skills are learned from the moment you set foot in this mystical realm. Fishing, a crucial aspect of survival in any Viking setting, should be a skill that players can develop from the outset. It's a fundamental part of Viking life and should be treated as such in-game.\n\n# The Merchant Shouldn't Sell Fishing Rods\n\nOne of the core principles of Valheim is self-reliance and exploration. Having to purchase a fishing rod from the merchant undermines this principle. Vikings were self-sufficient, crafting their own tools and relying on their own abilities to thrive in harsh environments.\n\n# Drawing Inspiration from Assassin's Creed Valhalla\n\nLook no further than Assassin's Creed Valhalla for an example of how to integrate authentic Viking experiences into gaming. In that game, fishing is depicted realistically, with Vikings using spears and handlines rather than modern rods. This approach enhances immersion and keeps players connected to the Viking way of life.\n\n# How Vikings Actually Fished\n\nInstead of the modern fishing rod, Valheim should introduce authentic Viking fishing methods. Imagine crafting a fishing spear or fashioning a primitive handline from available resources. These methods not only align with historical accuracy but also add depth to the survival mechanics of the game.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, I urge the developers to reconsider the inclusion of the modern fishing rod in Valheim. Let's stay true to the Viking ethos of resourcefulness, craftsmanship, and historical accuracy. By removing the modern fishing rod and reintroducing authentic Viking fishing techniques, we can enhance the immersion and respect the rich cultural heritage that Valheim embodies.\n\nLet's keep the spirit of the Vikings alive in Valheim!\n\nSk\u00e5l!",

Me and my friend just built a octagonal portal hub and it was hell trying to make a seamless good looking roof (I think I did a great job. Just need it to rain to make sure no rain gets thru) because the pieces just didn't want to line up right without meshing together in places and looking horrible. Same for the floor.

Left the original gear that they actually crafted in a random chest (maybe they crafted by accident?)\n3. Spawned fish and bread (I don't think I've ever seen them fishing?)\n4. Dropped level 4 mistlands gear into a chest (this was the final nail in the coffin, we can't even upgrade to level 4 yet) \n\nAlso when people spawn things in, there is no \"crafted by\" entry on the gear. \n\nThey also spawned in a whole lot of resources, and once we found out that they had spawned stuff in and they fest up to it, we had them put all of the stuff into an obliterator.

But they love using all high level food just to farm and do chores while leaving a chest full of jerky and eyescream. \n\n So one day i decided to get on alone after work and i grinded my ass off to collect resources and make two green metal chests, one fill with stamina food, one filled with health. And i hit them under the castle. The day ashlands dropped, i opened the floor and showed them. I said we are going to NEED this. \n\n  Our first land drop in the ashlands was brutal, i wosh i could have recorded it but i was so caught up.

Me and two other friends do most of the building in the main base, people give suggestions and requests in the discord server on what to build or improve. I fish and maintain most of the crops and livestock, our mage-oriented people keep sap and mushroom farms going while occasionally gathering royal jelly. \n\nOne dude loves his fermenters and keeps us stocked with meads. Another group does heavy exploration and most of our metal gathering as a result, but if we have a massive need we all chip in. A couple of dudes spend most of their time in combat so most of our mob resources come from them while us base-maids keep them fed and hydrated.\n\nPretty much all of us cook stuff during downtime, and everything is communally shared. If there is a scarcity for some resource we always discuss the best use, but most of the time my friends are pretty reasonable when it comes to gear upgrades and their priorities. Even if there's no scarcity we usually announce what we use so people know the general resource situation.\n\nSome stuff like fishing poles, picks, axes, hoes and cultivators are shared, but we keep our personal armor sets and weapons in our houses/rooms and sometimes lend them to one another. Megingjords, wisplights, swamp keys and wishbones are common property.\n\nWorks out perfectly without any drama, but then again it's a group of IRL friends who also play stuff like WoW in the same guild.",
