            "We know why this update isn't for Win 11 24H2 because this is still in Preview but Microsoft pulled it from Preview Channel out due of problems encountered by users:\n\nMicrosoft has unexpectedly halted the rollout of the upcoming Windows 11 24H2 update to Windows Insiders on the Release Preview Channel. The pause was quietly announced through an update to the\u00a0[original release blog post](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/05/22/releasing-windows-11-version-24h2-to-the-release-preview-channel/), which had initially touted the preview's new features like Wi-Fi 7 support, Sudo for Windows, Rust in the Windows kernel, and various UI enhancements. Microsoft has not provided an official reason for hitting the brakes on the 24H2 preview rollout. Brandon LeBlanc, the Windows Insider Senior Program Manager, simply stated, \"We are working to get it rolling out again shortly.\"\n\nHowever, a glimpse at the Microsoft Feedback Hub reveals a multitude of issues reported by Insiders testing the 24H2 build. Complaints range from application freezes and performance degradation to VPN connectivity problems. Some users have even taken to social media to voice their frustrations, with one describing the Arm version as a \"disastrous, worst 'release' preview I can remember.\" The Release Preview Channel is typically recommended for commercial users and those wanting to test upcoming Windows releases before general availability. Meanwhile, the Dev Channel caters to users who are comfortable with instability and rough edges. As The Register notes, the current situation echoes Microsoft's troubled rollout of the Windows 10 October 2018 Update, which contained a data deletion bug. from Techpowerup site: [https://www.techpowerup.com/323516/microsoft-pulls-windows-11-24h2-from-release-preview-channel-build-riddled-with-bugs](https://www.techpowerup.com/323516/microsoft-pulls-windows-11-24h2-from-release-preview-channel-build-riddled-with-bugs)\n\nEdit: You have info from official Microsoft announcement: \n\n**UPDATE 6/7:**\u00a0We are temporarily pausing the rollout of Windows 11, version 24H2 to the Release Preview Channel. We will resume the rollout in the coming weeks. from [https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/05/22/releasing-windows-11-version-24h2-to-the-release-preview-channel/](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/05/22/releasing-windows-11-version-24h2-to-the-release-preview-channel/)",
            "It was pulled from release previous.",
            "It has been withdrawn from release preview. Currently the build is highly unstable, it has skipped the beta channel so it missed rigorous testing and feedback collection.",
            "So, you don't have that option highlighted in blue? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cv42duuhh66d1.png?width=336&format=png&auto=webp&s=2171a407136f98b5b86a9476b53a1001232c07d6",
            "Well what are we supposed to do now? Clean install Windows to get back on main release? For me Windows 11 24H2 works great for gaming and work, no issues so far that force me to go back. Security updates is my only concern at the moment.",
            "They will probably push something before the surface release then. Or maybe it works fine on those devices.",
            "Nope \"uninstall\" is still greyed out as if I am not part of the EEA",
            "I don't know Clean install or wait for them to rollout to Preview again because they stated that they rollout in the coming weeks, but when you don't have issues then wait for it",
            "Very strange. Is your OS up to date?",
            "Yup, everything up to date, event went as far as checking the registry to see if my device considers itself to be in germany and it does"

            "My preferred platform is Linux.  However, they require us to run Windows at work.\n\nI've been using WSL since I started at this job in 2017.\n\nA couple of months ago I got a new laptop and an upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11.  I installed Debian into WSL2 and along with VcXsrv, everything is working great.  All my code is on the Linux file system along with tools like IntelliJ IDEA, Ansible and git.  I'm managing my Java tools like the JDKs, maven, groovy and Spark with SDKMAN in Linux.  I'm running Docker and Kubernetes in Linux.  Performance is great doing git checkouts and builds in Linux on the Linux file system.  Basically everything important is running on Linux while I still have access to stuff like Outlook and Teams that the company requires us to use.\n\nWSLg: Previously I used MobaXterm.  It's good they are trying to provide an X11 solution that is integrated with the rest of the platform.  This is convenient for when you are first installing.  WSLg also does a good job of discovering Linux apps and writing the Windows launchers for them.  But, WSLg isn't quite ready.  I often had to try several times to do something like click on a control or grab the corner of a window to resize it.  I think their Wayland-first approach is misguided and has resulted in a solution that only kind of half works.  This is why I wound up using VcXsrv.  There are quite a few X server solutions for Windows including half a dozen free ones so this isn't a big problem.\n\nMy sense is Windows 11 is better than Windows 10 as a platform to run Linux on.  My performance doing builds improved a lot when I switched to doing everything on the Linux file system.  As far as the actual Windows stuff, mixed feelings.  It feels like they just moved a bunch of the UI stuff around for no good reason.  Other than WSL, I prefer Windows 10.",

I can organize my directories myself thank you.

            "Mostly positive.\n\nBeen using Windows 11 at work (software development) since the day it came out. Started the installation when I went to lunch, and it had completed the update when I came back.\n\n- The UI is much nicer than on Windows 10. Most things just look nicer, with rounded corners and an overhauled Settings application. Windows 8 introduced the awfully dull Metro design language, which also infested Windows 10's square-centric UI. Windows 11 finally gave us some of that eye candy that we've been missing since Windows 7.\n- The start menu is definitely a step down. But then again, I only really use it for the apps I have pinned, which works the same as it did on Windows 10 (minus the moveable tiling system).\n- The new context menu doesn't bother me. It has most of what I need, and if I want the old context menu, holding down shift really isn't that hard.\n- DevDrive (ReFSI) is supposedly faster than NTFS for the average development work, but I haven't been in a situation where it has made an actual impact.\n- Being able to change the default console host from conhost to Windows Terminal is a massive win. I'm really glad this feature got backported to Windows 10, which my aging PC at home is stuck at.\n- The \"slideshow\" option for wallpapers recently broke, disabling itself if you change virtual desktops. Definitely a bug, and not a dealbreaker. Patience is a virtue.\n- Windows Explorer has started crashing in the past week or so. Annoying, as this also means all file browsing windows close, but it's not the biggest problem for my workflow.\n\nIn terms of functionality, I'd rate it a little bit higher than Windows 10, as it does have a few extra features here and there.\n\nIn terms of UI and desktop environment, I'd rate it quite a bit higher than Windows 10.

LTSC and StartAllBack is the way to go just like in Win10. No Co-Pilot, no Recall, no bloatware, no ads, no TPM and secure boot requirements. Just the pure OS.\n\nI don't think Win11 will stay long in our lives, probably they will announce Win12 in 2-3 years. It feels just like the Vista times. Some people loves and says it's the best, some people hates and still gonna use older versions, till we have the new version of course.\n\nStill can't understand why they don't make a proper taskbar and start menu just like what they did in XP, Vista and 7 and just changing the textures with modern ones (and making able to use older textures just like what we had in XP, Vista and 7 as Classic Theme and Classic Start Menu option) instead of redesigning everything and forcing users to use it. \n\nIn 8, they removed start menu and start button and forced people to use Metro UI. Then they made start button back in 8.1. Then they made a new start menu in Win10 and removed Metro UI. Then they removed that menu and now forcing people to use weird centred button and big menu.

I get why they made the whole compact context menu thing, it makes sense for casual users, but I use shortcuts for almost everything in the simplified menu. If I'm right clicking, it's almost always for something in the normal menu. The fact that this not only wasn't a feature from day one but still isn't now is ludicrous.

And every time it\u2019s more hassle to install it without Microsoft Account. And I\u2019ve constantly sweating when installing it. \n\nNow I\u2019ve bought PS5, some games are unplayable without mods, but it\u2019s pretty nice. MacBook M1 as development computer. \n\nAnd now I\u2019m selling my PC. It\u2019s time. \n\nMicrosoft ruined it. It\u2019s fucking unbearable that every update it\u2019s adding features against advanced users. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to deal with parents that are using Windows 11 because it\u2019s changing and I\u2019m less familiar with it every month. \n\nmacOS is limited in printers drivers support, desktop Linux is still breaks after updating on big release and don\u2019t support MS Office that my dad needs for work.",
            "It works, that is the most important thing",
            "Gutter trash",
            "Not bad! Pretty stable actually.",
            "Still comically bad.",
            "I\u2019ve been running Windows 11 for a while now, and all I can say is eh! It\u2019s no Windows ME,or Windows 8, but it\u2019s been a good OS nevertheless",
            "personally prefer Windows 11, I like the UI, especially the taskbar. also, easier window snapping is such a godsend. new settings app is also nicer, so yeah on the whol I'm a fan",
            "soumething about windows 12",
            "My PC auto upgraded to 11. I was like wtf at first, but the system runs, games run on it, I am content.",
            "Same, as long the shit i want runs on it and it doesnt inflict anger from me (it crashing and or other malfunctions which are not caused by me)",
            "Thanks for your weighted opinion in the world of polarities.",
            "I'm told it's the equivalent of a chest X-ray.",
            "Yep. For me it feels like a third party WIP skin for 10, makes most of it look a bit better at the expense of performance.",
            "Not to mention the constant feature creep that slows down the experience and invades the privacy.",
            ">It looks cute but regarding the performance and bugs, I find it in every way worst than Win 10.\n\nI see this a lot, but for me it's been so much more stable. I don't think I've had a single random bluescreen or freeze on windows 11 in the past 2 years, and I'm a heavy user. Windows 10 I had to bloody reset every few months just to keep the OS running. I've been using Windows 11 since it's first public beta launch because of this.\n\nThat being said the support for windows 11 is atrocious. I have so many more apps themselves freezing the OS or the app itself freezing just because it's on windows 11 - Affinity Designer comes to mind, and Valorant likes to freeze on windows 11 quite frequently.\n\nNot to mention simple things like *New Folder* not resulting in the file explorer refreshing so you end up manually refreshing 3 times just to create a god damn new folder. And how in 2024 is there still no way to view a folder's size without external tools or going into each individually? At least none that I know of.\n\nI *like* windows 11. As I say, it's 10x more stable for me and I like the UI - and the fact things like settings are a bit more organized. But it's the simple things like refreshing folders or multi-monitor scaling that still sucks for no reason.\n\nEdit: OHHHH and bloody windows search. How on earth is 50% of my surface pro's CPU always used for mapping things on my hard drive and yet SEARCH STILL SUCKS",
            "Yea. Windows 10 all the way. Dont like 11 with the extra clicks to basic stuff",
            "Might change significantly later this year with upgrades. But I am not keeping my hopes up.",
            "I agreed with you completely until you said that about the UI\u2026 for me the UI is one of the worst points there is. It\u2019s simply a mobile phone UI, reducing the productivity you can achieve with Win10. There\u2019s absolutely no need for all that padding literally everywhere, except if you have a touchscreen which nobody has or uses. The UI is uniform, that\u2019s true, but it\u2019s also the least productive UI they have ever created, purely because it might look better and people with touchscreens can use it. And not even to talk about them hiding simple features behind extra clicks, simply because they want to limit context menus for example. It is ridiculous and the main reason I downgraded back to Win10.",
            "So many good, tiny QOL of life things that were on Windows 10 are now gone. Like, how the fuck did they mess up dragging files or right click so bad? Performance and workflow is just terrible on Windows 11 and I\u2019m running a very capable PC. \n\nSuffice to say, I\u2019m sticking to 10 as long as I possibly can.",
            "Correct! It doesn't feel snappy and even windows explorer's ribbon bar takes a second to load \ud83d\ude04 Also when you switch between virtual desktops, the taskbar blinks \ud83d\ude05",
            "Don't worry. One day, the start menu will work all the time, like Windows 7... one day... \ud83e\udd72",
            "I\u2019ve been using Windows 11 since it was released publicly, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve encountered any bugs or issues. And while I haven\u2019t benchmarked my PC with Win11 vs Win10, I haven\u2019t noticed any performance issues.\n\nCould you provide some examples of the bugs you are talking about?",
            ">The snipping tool that can extract text\n\nYou mean I don't need Powertoys for this?\nThat's good to know\n\n>The right click menu\n\nNice that it can be reverted via regedit \n\nDumb that's it's not a simple switch in the settings",
            "For searching, install software called \"Everything\". It's amazing, it uses the file system index. Super fast. Doesn't index file contents though.",
            "What is this witchcraft you speak of?? Taskbar on the left? Please give us another decade or so to develop this extremely complicated feature request!",
            "I swear to god the animations are all over the place, even little ones like opening the start menu or minimizing an app, sometimes is smooth and sometimes it just jumps the screen",
            "Yeah, it's pretty slow, like things take time to load up in the file explorer",
            "Bloated is right, hey you want your start menu with or without ads, umm without? Fuck ya, here have some ads instead.",
            "I remember in Windows 7 and earlier, opening and browsing the file explorer was instantaneous.\nIn W11 it takes a while to open, it flashes white and sometimes it bugs...\nDude, it's file explorer...",

            "Same, can\u2019t complain for a goddamn thing. It\u2019s almost flawless",
            "Just like Windows 7 and XP was\u2026",

            "For me, win 11 fixed a well known ridiculously ultra annoying (though harmless) win 10 glitch that had no solutions that I was aware of. It was being reported by various users since 2019 or 2020 with microsoft simply not fixing it. Win 11 fixed it like a charm.\n\nI was only annoyed by 2 things:\n\n1) Highly fundamental stuff that used to be 1 mouse click was now 2 mouse click. This is still the case but I am no longer annoyed\u2026 I accepted the new reality.\n\n2) Photos app REMOVING a feature. Mainly \u201cthe ability to draw something in a image when zoomed\u201d, it was fucking, brain-rottingly stupid because the ability to draw was still there. You just shouldn\u2019t zoom it for some reason. Since I heavily used the feature when fixing my calculation errors rather than retaking a picture\u2026 it literally ruined my way of life and I hated the OS. The feature has been (thankfully) re-added though I no longer need it anymore.",

            "A lot of issues I've had with it are with File Explorer and mapping network drives or being able view content in those mapped drives. It's a LOT slower then with Win 10. Pulling up pics or doc's, even just simple .txt files take forever to load. We're talking over a minute to load in some cases with a 10k file size on a gig lan. There should be absolutely no reason for that at all. This happens on a regular basis. Win 10 laptop on wireless loads consistently faster sitting side by side on the same spec laptop then the Win 11 box that's hardwired.\n\nPulling up Device Manager is sometimes slower then dirt when having to look at what com port your plugged into while using Putty to configure a switch. The over all general slowness is irritating. It's an extra 5 seconds here, 4 there, 10 here, minute there, three minutes here. Through out the work day, it's time wasted and irritatingly frustrating to work on.\n\nEdit: word",

Same Synology box on our network, same network, only difference was going from Win10 to Win11.\n\nOther big complaint is that starting a file content search in Explorer is still a wild experience where hitting enter on a query doesn't do anything until you futz around with the query (i.e. remove a character and retry and then put it back) or some incantation I haven't figured out yet.",
