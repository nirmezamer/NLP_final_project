            "Can you choose to only have a certain time period in civ 6? Like if I just want it to be the classical swords and horses and not expand into modern tech and armies can I set a game up with a stopping point?",
            "Did anybody try the new monthly challenge, Terra Ingognita? \n\nI've been enjoying them so far and although I like the idea of the current one, it seem very broken.\n\nEven on emperor it's trivially easy to rush Cartography and just take over the entire new continent before other nations even bother to explore, leaving you with insane resources and luxuries.\n\nIn my quickly finished game at Prince, London had two cities that could do nothing but rebel at disadvantageous locations. Liking the idea I started again on Emperor, and it was even smoother other than slightly more trigger happy Barbarians...",
            "I got into a game where I couldn\u2019t for the life of me set up any campuses with greater than 1 adjacency bonuses. How do I overcome this? I fell way behind on science and never caught up.",
            "Hi. I'm new here, so don't know if I ask in the right place, but anyway. I have R&F, my friends don't. Can I do anything to play as Genghis Khan in game with my friends? Or we all need to own R&F?",
            "How good does Civ VI work on the Nintendo switch? Is it playable or is it very laggy?\n\nAnd is the Anthology dlc worth it (on switch)?\n\nEdit: I bought the base game! Because it\u2019s \u20ac3! Now the question about the Anthology DLC still stands, right now also on sale for \u20ac20",
            "Is \u201cGod of the Sea\u201d pantheon applied only proactively to new fishing boat improvements? \n\nI had several already improved fishing improvements in my civilization when I picked this pantheon, but I am not seeing any improvements to production from these. I just improved a fishing tile since I picked pantheon, and I see the extra production. \n\nIs there a way around this? This is stupid, but is it worth it to get a builder, destroy all fishing improvements, and rebuild them? Feels like a waste to do pantheon without the tiles I already own",
            "Is $25ish the cheapest the Civ 6 Anthology gets? I saw it listed on steamDB for $11.50 but only for a single day",
            "I have been playing Civ V for years but I have never managed to win the game at level 5. Does anyone have any suggestions for strategies to try so I can beat it? Which leader is the best? \nThanks! :) \n(ps I don\u2019t have any dlc or anything fancy like that)",
            "Got a new pc and am wondering if you could transfer your hall of fame to your new pc\n\n\nMy new pc hall of fame has all leaders not highlighted and the victory type/amount of victory tries.\n\nIs there a way to transfer the files over?",
            "Is there any way to edit existing game saves to remove a mod depndency? I started a game on Windows and it had the Julius Caesar mod enabled - although I'm pretty sure the game doesn't use it in any way, but I then tried to transfer that save over to a Linux machine and, although it can find the save, it won't load it because the Julius Caesar mod isn't installed. \n\nI have connected to my 2K account, but I'm still not getting JC. I also tried contacting 2K support who said I need to contact Aspyr support - and their support site isn't working for me!",
            "I was running away with a game and then out of nowhere my GPT began declining and then massively went into the negative for no reason. I googled it and people are saying it\u2019s enemy spies. How do I prevent this from happening? I started putting spies in my cities as defense but they can\u2019t catch the enemy spy. I\u2019m about to lose now.",
            "Multiplayer is being weird, I've seen multiple videos and researched, and everyone with the same config doesn't seem to have the same problem as me. I can't find my friends in the world, we've put it in huge and it's still super small, and everyone's map is different. I have no idea what is happening as we're all begginers. Help is appreciated. We're all playing Civ VI.",
            "So I've never been one to indulge in other era starts besides ancient (and classical if im feeling spicy). Knocked out a renaissance one for the achievement but noticed old wonders like hanging gardens wernt available. Pretty sure I checked early on and saw they were unavailable so were they sniped by the AI or straight up not available with a renaissance or later start?",
            "There are mods to do it, but unsure of their names, being a console player.  You can\u2019t do it without mods, and I\u2019m really hoping Civ 7 will give us something like that. \n\nWithout mods, the best you can do is play on the slower game speeds, which lets you spend more time in each era and you can explore much of the world that way, but the production costs increase accordingly so it still takes a long time to build said units.",
            "As the game goes on, a districts's value is more down to it's buildings than it's adjacency bonuses, so you can focus on those. You can also consider putting envoys into scientific city states. Pillaging can be a great way to pick up science too.. Sheer number and size of cities will help too.",
            "I usually don't prioritize or even bother building a campus until I'm done making industrial zones and commercial hubs for all my cities.\u00a0 The passive science you get from population is generally enough to keep your research going at a reasonable pace in the early to mid game. After my city has good income and production I may make a few campuses if I'm not aiming for a science victory, or many campuses if I am.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "yes you all need the dlc",
            "if interested the game and all dlc are on huge discount on steam",
            "It's extremely slow and is basically 100% guaranteed to crash if you play on standard or larger map sizes.",
            "It should apply to current boats. Any chance it's a display bug? Like, if you click on your city and tally up production sources, are the pantheon bonuses there?",
            "it definitely applies to existing ones as well for me",
            "For now, yes. It might drop in price closer to a Civ 7 release.",
            "When jumping up a difficulty level, I find its easiest to pick a civ that really drives you to a particular victory condition and a particular playstyle. Its been awhile since I've played Civ V, but I'd think a few good civs, and the reasons for playing them, would be:  \n-Venice - you may have to save-scum a bit to get a decent starting coastal location, but then you can focus just on trading, building trading wonders, getting a ton of gold, playing Tall/Tradition/Rationalism.  \n-England - play an archipelago map, and build a strong navy and conquer most of the world.  \n-Zulu - same, but land-based. Play Pangea, build up a military, run over all your neighbors.  \n\nAlternatively, just play the really strong civs (Poland, Korea, Babylon) and lean into/really understand how to play well. For instance, Poland - what are the optimal social policies. For Korea/Babylon - how do you maximize science.  \n\nFor what its worth, the DLC really improves the game. It takes Civ V from a \"B\" game to an \"A/A+\" game.",
            "I'm not sure but I wonder if you log into a 2k account on both if that works. Or if you enable cloud saves through steam on both devices if that does anything.",
            "You can do it by copying the HallofFame.sqlite file from your old pc to your new pc. Should be in Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Sid Meier's Civilization VI.\n\nThats how I did it, iirc",
            "If you hovor over the GPT in the top left it should tell you where your money is going. Make sure your spies are defending either on or adjacent to the commercial hub districts. Start trading with the highest yield trade routes. Delete units or put in the military card that reduces unit maintenance. Put in other cards that increase GPT.",
            "Do you have any more info? Do you all show up in the same lobby before starting?",
            "Wonders from previous eras aren't available.",
            "Is it possible (or semi likely) to play at slow speeds and end the game before transitioning into later periods?\n\nRise is nations let you pick certain time periods, tbh that should always be an option for these types of games \n\nBut yeah I mostly play on Xbox so I guess I\u2019m beat",
            "Yeah I tried to spread wide and make as many campuses as possible but it was simply too slow. And because of opportunity cost the time spent on campuses was time not spent on builders and commercial districts and my production suffered and I fell behind.",
            "That\u2019s wild to me",
            "Without GS enabled I find it rarely crashes on standard maps.  I do a lot of \u201cjust one more turn\u201d play, so I often have games going well beyond 500 turns.  For me this is okay, because with late game play I find GS pretty much breaks my enjoyment anyway.\n\nBut yeah, it takes a while at that point to process turns.",
            "Thank you :)",
            "We simply start the lobby on the default rules but the map for everyone of us is different",
            "It\u2019s probably easier with some civs than others.  Like I\u2019d imagine with Rome you could build up a large army fairly quickly and conquer everyone on Terra or Pangaea.  Maybe someone more skilled than me can whip up a culture or religion victory that quickly, but tbh that doesn\u2019t seem like much fun.",
            "I'm not sure if this would work, but in advanced setup you can change there to be a set limit of turns. You could maybe have the slower game speed and end the game in a lower number of turns? That way you would have more time in the earlier eras and end the game by the time it starts getting later. Just a thought, not sure if it would work but you could try.",
            "I kind of agree with the other commenter. It depends on your difficulty, but I generally focus on putting down the most amount of cities as possible first. I might put a campus in my capital and maybe my second city if I'm focusing science. But if you focus on having a lot of cities and your core cities having high population, then you'll find that your science and culture just balloons. Don't forget to put Pingala in your highest pop city and level him up because that should be at least ten science and culture each. Religion can help too. It can help boost your population through food output. Or you can get tenants and buildings that boost your science and culture.",
            "Go to multiplayer, > unified play> start the lobby> grab the join code> have people join with that join code. Before you start the game, do you see everyone in the same lobby as you? Can you see their steam names? Send a picture to confirm."

            "I would like more variety between different Civs. Venice from Civ5 was a great example. Having a Civ which could, for example, work five tiles from the capital instead of 3 would be amazing even if they had other penalties and would make the game totally different for different players",
            "I\u2019m very worried about the multi-platform launch. The fact that a switch can barely run Civ VI but will be a Civ VII launch platform reads to me like VII will not even come close to pushing the envelope of 10 years of compute advancements since the Civ VI engine.",
            "Some things id like: \n\nI want  more alt leaders focused on different victory types for the same civ. Catherine can stay for culture for France but add Napoleon for domination and war. Japan can easily have different leaders that focus on either war, culture or even science/industry. \n\nI'd love even more, even bigger True Start Maps. Give us True Start China and let a dozen different Chinese dynasties compete to become the most powerful. True Start Africa so African civilizations get more focus.\n\nGive us scenarios again but make them even better. Add a Sengoku period scenario to unify Japan, or even alt history scenarios like conquering Europe as the Mongols.\n\nMAKE NAVIES MORE IMPORTANT!",
            "1: I would like to see is more contemporary/modern era civilizations or units like the Soviet union, Peoples republic of China, Argentina and post-reunification Italy. \n\n2: Another thing I would like is MAD/mutually assured destruction. One thing I liked about Humankind was when you launched a nuclear bomb it took a turn so it gave the enemy a chance to launch but in civ who ever declares war first is the one to launch and hit in the same turn which feels like the total opposite of the purpose of nuclear bombs which is to deter aggression. \n\n3: No Asset limit along with more life to city's something akin to the City Sprawl Graphics mod for civ6 to make city's feel more thick and dense and really urban. Maybe little trains on train-tracks you make   \n  \n4-This ones more of a loose idea but some sort of minor nation mechanic that works almost identical to city states, I like city states but I feel like bigger entities (thinking 2-4 citys) that are non-player would allow more opportunity's as well as provide better interactions between majors and minor nations with new diplomatic dynamics. It always felt off or strange that the world is filled with these massive powers like Russia and the United states and the only other political entity there is are these tiny 1 city states. I do see the glaring issue that I feel as if it would be difficult to add and make it feel civ-like (as well with lag from Ai troop spaml).",

            "I\u2019d love them to expand upon monopolies and corporations more, and think it\u2019d go well with a way to either sell tiles to other players or a return of something like the civ v great general and citadels. Add both an aggressive and cooperative way to obtain more of your monopoly resource without conquering the city. \n\nI\u2019d also love to see Vassals with adjustable taxes. Instead of wiping someone out of the game have them contribute to your empire, while also their own empire, allowing them to rebel at a later point if they like. This would remove the need to micromanage a whole continent if that\u2019s not your play style, at the cost of the full benefit of those cities. Have all luxuries count toward the conquering nation\u2019s monopoly, to add more interactions and depth with that system.\n\n\nAnd I have been asking for it on threads for years, but I want a scientific America as powerful as civ v Korea/babylon. I think JFK would be a very fitting leader to have in the franchise given the way the science victory condition works. Though a production monster would perhaps be even better, I\u2019d love to see FDR return.",

            "Though of the day, with advances in \u2018AI\u2019 (and I know it\u2019s not AI) I think the game can really make some fantastic autogenerated maps with \u2018territory borders\u2019 which revolve around terrain difficulty/coasts/forests/rivers and improve upon the current hex system. Imagine a wood being divided into smaller regions emphasizing it\u2019s difficulty to trek through but plains being larger territories making them easier to cross.",
            "I hope that civilizations get more unique mechanics that are exclusive to only them to really make civilizations stand out more from each other rather than they have some \"stats and number differences\" at the end of the day. \n\nLike let's see a unique Mandate of Heaven mechanic that only China has, or a Manifest Destiny mechanic as America.\n\nMy concern with this idea is that this would make each civ more taxing to develop, and thus there would be less civilizations overall probably, and people love to see more new civilizations, so they can't be too different.\n\nCiv 6 was a step in the right direction to me with unique leader and civ abilities over just Civ 5's simple civ abilities, but I'd like to see Civ 7 expand even more on what differentiates each civ.",
            "Unpopular opinion, but I'd like a really different game from V and VI. They should keep the basics, but I'd want a complete evolution. I feel like most people just want a Civ VI.5 (while Civ VI itself was a Civ V.5). I would prefer more experimentation.",
            "I genuinely think Patrick Wyman (Tides of History podcast and author) is narrating Civ 7. He's been to their offices during development, and a host of Trashfuture podcast (friend to Patrick, who has been on the show) has also said he believes so. Could be wrong but seems like a reasonable source.",

            "I like the way Civ 6 lets you modify your government easily, with the social policy cards system, but I'd quite like a more long term commitment mechanism like in Civ 5. \n\nPerhaps having two systems, the Civ 6 version that gets new choices every civic research completed, and a more rare upgrade opportunity that occurs with specific civic unlocks, similar to the governors in 6.",
            "I hope there are new mechanisms for air combat and sea combat:\n\n+ Aerospace zoom of control, Air Superiority.\n+ Multiple turn bombard missions, instead of fly as fast as ICBM\n+ More options to airdrop troops\n+ Bring back sea blockade from CIV 4\n+ Automatic trade routes privateering\n+ Escort ships to trade routes",
            "I wouldn't mind if CivVII delved also more into the late game with Expansion to the Moon or Mars. Practically an extra playset for the Moon and Mars, simultaneously. That might or might not be interesting. I wonder if it was somehow possible to move Civ into the Solar System once the initial space race is over, practically turning it into some kind of For All Mankind or The Expanse. Probably too much to wish for.\n\n  \nEither way I never found my way into VI, and still play V and Unciv religiously. I like the religious wars aspect, it was too simple in V.  \n\n  \nI would love some canals to connect inland cities with the sea.",

            "Chandragupta was a step in the right direction for India. Time to remove Gandhi and have an actual Indian Prime minister as leader of India. Older leaders like Chandragupta should be turned into their own civs, and more Indian civs please like Marathas, Guptas, Sikh Empire, Vijaynagara Empire etc",
            "I'm trying to think what they could do to make CIv VII really stand out from the other Civs.\n\nCiv VI felt so close to a perfection of the formula IMO that I don't know what the next big step could be. \n\nI hope there isn't too much focus on a new combat system. Combat is very low down on the list of reasons I play Civ. I'd like health to come back and be an important part of city management, and I'd like immigration to be a thing (quite surprising it hasn't been before now). And yeah, navigable rivers would be cool. But what's the USP going to be?\n\nIt would be really interesting if the games were much more dynamic. Civilisations actually rising and falling throughout the game, instead of the same base list gradually shrinking. But it would be really hard to make this work in a way that isn't frustrating to the player and doesn't make the player feel overpowered. I don't see Firaxis going with this.\n\nI think they might make combat the USP, but like I said, I really hope not. But I just struggle to think what the next step could be that would make Civ VII feel like its own game and not just DLC.",
            "For the love of god fix the combat. I'm tired of siege doing like 3 damage against walls which the AI can just spawn. Defensive play in VI is way *way* too easy. If you're not ready for war, you should be punished for it. Siege units are already incredibly weak, at least let them dish out good damage. And if we're gonna keep the city attack (I say remove it and only the encampment should have it), you at least need ranged units garrisoning the city for it to activate.",
            "1. Naval early discovery and warfare(in all eras) are massively lacking in Civ 6. I hope to see some better AI and mechanics for this in Civ 7. (Current US Navy, British/German WW2/1 Navy\\[Yes I know, Uboats... subs are boring\\], Spanish Armada, Portuguese Exploration Fleets, and Age of Pirates to take inspiration from)\n\n2. Tech overhaul: Tech tree's have always bothered me in these types of games, everything is too linear. I want to see some sprawling tree's I want tech choices to matter. If one player goes down a military tree, they should have a distinct advantage against one who doesn't. There are advantages in current iterations, but they seem nominal and the catchup mechanic makes it so they aren't so special. Also, you should be able to pour more research into a specific tech to \"level up\" that tech. (Maybe you're playing Germany in 1940's your Airforce contains BF 109Bs but if you route more research into your airforce tech you can upgrade them to BF 109Gs for a better performing unit. This can also apply to non combat techs, its just easier to make the comparison with combat techs)\n\n3. Tech Sharing: To combat stagnant researching periods, you should be able to trade techs for resources/gold/units/political leverage. Maybe you're playing a trading nation, you focus on trade and gold production, your neighbors are a cultural powerhouse and are slowly influencing your nation turn by turn. Why not trade some of that gold and some political leverage, for some military tech to help you keep them at bay. You get a boost to military, military nation gets to field their soldiers for some more turns, and they can call in a little political favor.\n\n4. AI in general just needs to be less predictable. World Congress needs to be reworked to be more meaningful, and much more taxing to be on the wrong side of it or make it so you can form your own congress(UN/BRICS as an example). Major wars should be an event, you should have to pick a side, even if you're just providing aide and not fighting in it. These wars should slow down the game significantly until they're resolved. The world, or most of it, is in a scrap, not much else is getting doneor matters.\n\n5. Slow the game down slightly. The era/tech pacing seems too fast. Of course leave options for faster games.\n\n6. BIGGER MAPS. Civ 6 seems very small compared to competitors games.",
            "A lot of \"create an empire that spans all of human history\" 4x games have come out since Civ VI. Humankind, Old World, Millennia.

With any luck some level of merging of cities even like in real life.\n\n- Armada, Great person and barb -systems from 6.\n\n- Either dynamic promotions based on what unit has done or civ 4-5 style free options. Get rid of the super narrow options civ 6 promotion tree gave which ate half the fun of wars.\n\n- Natural disasters and random events.\n\n- Ditch the mobile platform and art-style to give us nice graphics again.\n\n- Bring back the most known leaders even if they are controversial(such as Mao, Stalin and Hitler) instead of only using safe ones.\n\n- Strong nation and leader bonuses so differences to other leaders are notable. Civ 6 had horrible start with blandest bonuses initially.\n\n- Civ 6 government system as base, but one that builds over time.

Also could see some advantages in having encampments being able to build units direct, taking units out of the city build queue allowing everyone to have bigger armies for more fun combat\n\n- Have a max of one of each kind of specialised district per civ. This way placing your district is a real decision, and it'll push you to either go tall or highly specialise your cities if you're going wide. And then maybe in the late game there's a civic that allows either as many districts as you want but only one per city (for wide players) or as many districts in a city as you want but only a max of 3-4 of each kind per civ (for tall players)\n\n\\* Like you could easily merge holy site, campus and theater square into one district you call \"monastery\" - you can still have specialisation by making certain buildings within the district either/or.

Fleeing a country for work or depression is akin to the loyalty falling and a city joining another nation but it's not a perfect equivalency",

It feels right to have Big Ben actually in the Commercial Hub, or Broadway in the Theater Square. Some would still need their designated tiles, but with most requiring the presence of a specific district anyway, it seems like it would make both districts and those wonders feel better. The wonders take up less space and districts contain more varied and valuable buildings than the exact same chain for most of them.\n\nThe only problem is if you want a city to specialize in a particular resource, you're limiting the number of wonders you can have. Perhaps make it optional? So, if you have a free district, you can build it inside there, but if you don't you have to build it outside the district?",
            "I think they should break district tiles down into sub-tiles, and have multiple buildings, wonders, and improvements that can be built in that district. Once you fill up all the sub-tiles, nothing else can be built in that district. Adds a strategy and planning element to your districts with the added bonus of having every district appear slightly different on the map. One of my pet peeves with districts (outside of uniques) was that they all looked the same across every civ, every game. Got really monotonous to look at.",
            "I really really disagree with combining districts like this. Currently the specialist district list pairs with certain yield types nicely nearly one to one. Campuses give science, theatre squares culture, etc. Combining those core districts into one just means everyone has to build that district in each city because it's so good. \n\nI personally really like the Government plaza. Not only is it one per civ (which IMO they should expand on), but also allows you to pick different buildings which forces the player to make interesting decisions because opportunity cost. Like what if there were \"national districts\" that were like extra specialist districts but you could only build one per civ, but they would be better than regular districts of that type. This would allow you to specialize your cities more, and differentiate your core cities from your other cities. You could also build multiple national districts in the same city maybe to provide an avenue for tall play.",

Pops can migrate between cities.\n\n- Changes to religion. Get rid of the one religion per civ nonsense (Civ VI has two Chinese religions and three Indian religions). Ability to convert to different religions. Religious reformation and heresy.\n\n- Changes to world congress and diplomacy. Congresses are created between allied or friendly civs and not emerge spontaneously. And under no circunstances they force you to obbey decissions you are against. No city states.\n\n- Changes to resource management. Certain animal and plant resources can be replicated if terrain is appropiate (example, you can breed horses outside of their original steppe and you can grow coffee outside of the tropical regions of Ethiopia).\n\n- Changes to technology and civics. Certain techs or civics are tied to great characters or other unique ways to obtain them. The other civs have to trade for it or steal the secrets somehow. Sometimes, techs or civics can pasively extend to othe nations (think how gunpowder was discovered in China, brought to middle East by the Mongols and from there it extended to Europe, or how the American Revolution inspired further revolutions in both South America and France).\n\n- Changes to military. Allow more than one unit per tile. Manpower should be limited by money and food. Cities need garrison.\n\n- Changes to districts. Tiles are divided into seven slots (one per side and one in the center) and one building or wonder fits each slot (maybe some bigger ones need two?). Buildings may need to be built adjacent to other buildings and in most cases in tiles adjacent to the city center. This is to form cohesive cities and to prevent Civ VI city building gore (the city center is an empty husk, the campus is on the other side of the county to get an adjacency bonus and the landscape is dotted by wonders).",

Of course this identity didn't mean the same thing as during the era of nationalism in the 18th century or as it means today.

            "Step 1: Play as Portugal\n\nStep 2: Profit",
            "Portugal is the big one, but also huge Archipelago map, Owls, feitorias, running a LOT of trade routes from Lisbon alone (I'm guessing 30+, maybe even 50+), Hunza, Bandar Brunai, other trade city-states, trade policies, ecstatic. You can get multiple thousands per turn from a single city as Portugal.\n\n\nIf game speed affects spy speed, I would also guess they are on a slower speed, meaning that ~50k gold is spread over more turns.",
            "People tell you to play Portugal but you can do it also with Mali with Mansa Musa. You just need a good flat desert, a suguba in every city and let's get the GP and wonders that give +1 or more trade routes + economic city states. The amount of gold is so awesome that you just buy your victory, whatever victory it is",
            "Dutch, trade routes out the wazoo",
            "options ->\u00a0interface\u00a0-> show\u00a0yields\u00a0in HUD ribbon, you can choose always on or show on hover",
            "You're far more polite than I would be. Id drop a nuke to cancel the friendship immediately xD",
            "That was your friend?",
            "Money should be stealable by conquest up to a certain tech. Like, all your gold is divided between your cities based on pop: lost a city, gold goes with it",
            "Step 3 - Don\u2019t build a commercial hub unless you have spies protecting it.",
            "Really good point :)\nYou can add Torre de Belem and Great Zimbabwe (I got lucky to be able to build it due to the terrible placement restrictions) + all the GP who add trade routes + Reform the Coinage dedication + several gold modifiers such as Merchant Republic's 15% gold or Kilwa's effect with 2 trade city states I'm suzerain of",
            "Thanks so much for the explanation! I\u2019m a newish player and 30 trade routes is mind blowing, will def check out Portugal!",
            "That sounds really fun too! Thanks for adding on, everyone here is so helpful :)",
            "Bruh that's broken.",
            "Actually he only stole me what I earn in 8 turns lol",
            "Wait, you can do that?",
            "If those are his friends, I don't want to meet his enemies.",
            "Ooh I see thank you! I def need to do a run practicing all of these things now :)",
            "true.\n\n1. as the saying goes, keep your friends rich and your enemies rich and wait to find out which is which\n\n2. I find this fimiliar to what happened in burkina faso between compaore and sankara"
