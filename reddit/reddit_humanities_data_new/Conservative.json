But I would like to start the discussion about uniting politically as a country, finally. This post is a perfect example of an issue that divides us more than makes sense. The border isa shit show and that is an understatement. The media is run by rich people whose bottom line is the happiness of shareholders. Which means that our country has become a train with no conductor speeding off the rails because profit comes before infrastructure, health, or anything necessary to run a country. We are at the critical moment where we need to take advantage of technology RIGHT NOW and overcome their mind games. It\u2019s easy to dismiss something you dont agree with or be stubborn, and the point is not to change views. The goal is to find as much common ground as possible and stand more on that ground than anywhere else. Want to finally beat the corruption? The only way is together. I want it to be the cool, popular, viral attitude to have, where it catches on like wildfire to start trying our best not to fall for the media\u2019s bullshit and work together. If it does by a miracle from whatever source, catch on, it would influence future politicians and therefore our future for the better. If you read this far, thank you and please ask away or allow me to respond to any apprehensions. The border is the mess Im starting with to agree with you. So what do you agree with progressively? Lets start finding that common ground. Ps: just for an additional helpful note: I say progressive vs conservative rather than liberal because I believe that is more accurate to how most democratic voters think. Seriously.

Basically, the majority said that the US citizen spouse in the United States had no right to due process in relation to her husband's visa petition, and the dissent argued that she did.\n\nWhen the visa was denied, the Department of State did not provide a specific factual reason for the denial - just a reference to the inadmissibility ground in the INA that was used as justification for the denial; however, this alone didn't explain the actual reason for the denial since that ground is very broad and covers a wide range of potentially derogatory activity. So the married couple had no real idea why the immigrant spouse was denied. The US citizen spouse sued, saying she had a right to a specific factual reason for the denial. The Department of State declined to provide a reason for a long time, though they did eventually say it was because of suspected gang membership.\n\nThe dissenting opinion said that once that factual reason for the decision was delivered, due process was met and the case could be resolved there. The immigrant spouse would not be admitted - but the US citizen spouse would have received due process in the form of a specific factual reason for the denial. \n\nThe majority opinion said that the State Department had no obligation to provide a specific factual reason for the denial because the US citizen spouse didn't have any due process in relation to her spouses visa.",

That part means that children of foreign nationals not legally in the US do not become citizens by being born here, because they're \"under the jurisdiction\" of the home country of their parents.\n\nAll that is really required is a reinterpretation to the original meaning, and that doesn't require an amendment.",

It took a court case (US v Kim Wong Ark) to clarify that children born to legal immigrants were entitled to US citizenship, something that was being denied to Chinese immigrant children before hand. The 14th amendment also didn\u2019t apply to native Americans, and an act of congress had to be passed to confer citizenship to them. The same is true for every US territory, except American Samoa whose residents are *still* not considered US citizens despite being born in a U.S. territory. \n\nIf it took courts or congress to extend citizenship to all of those cases there is absolutely no reason to assume the 14th amendment automatically grants this right to children of illegal immigrants.

The purpose of the language, and birthright citizenship as the intent regardless of circumstances, as well as \"jurisdiction\" were all discussed rather plainly in Congress, which we have records for, and you can certainly look up.\u00a0 They knew full well what the text of the Amendment meant and would lead to, and wrote it regardless of these objections because the value gained was viewed as greater than the risks.",

Namely, it was debated that the original clause would have included children of Ambassadors and Soldiers, whom operate under official capacity of their home countries, and would have gained citizenship, which was not the intent nor desired.\n\n\n\u00a0It means, as was discussed during the ratification of the Amendment, that it does not apply to those operating under the *official* capacity of their home nations.

The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment sought to entrench the principle in the Constitution in order to prevent its being struck down by the Supreme Court or repealed by a future Congress.\n\n  It's about slaves and giving a constitutional basis to the act that freed them; there was talk about a clause to specifically exclude indians, but they passed because they assumed that 'jurisdiction thereof' was clear enough to do it.

Further, the Wong decision provided that the United States has jurisdiction over the land and territories of the country, of which those born would fall under United States Jurisdiction.\n\n\nThe remaining three exceptions to jus soli provided by the Wong decision are:\n\n\n1.\u00a0 Born of those who are officials of a country.\n2.

            "So an illegal alien raping a 13 year old isn't the problem according to Joy Reid? The problem is reporting it to the public. Got it.",
            "Your eyes decive you. Facts are just your own bias, and if you think otherwise, it just proves that you are a racist. /s",
            "Joy Reid can eat a bag of dicks for all I care. Daily!",
            "Suddenly #MeToo no longer matters when it's an illegal immigrant. Really makes you wonder what the priorities are. I am utterly mortified how callous a country we've become, all to pursue dogma and stay in line with political doctrine.",
            "Daily barrage of Democrat party loyalty over American people \n\nAny common sense Democrats left?\n\nYour party is destroying this country",
            "Ppl in denial should watch the video clip between Joy Reid & Rep. Pramila Jayapal.\n\nCan you imagine you as a parent being mocked and flippant remarks made on air about your child & you on MSNBC to the Nation  ? ...that YOU are causing 'fear mongering\" ???\n\nThese two women are insufferable. MSNBC should invite the mother on Air & Publicly apologize unreservedly by another Host. Joy needs to be suspended.",
            "Orange man bad, Depends man Jesus Christ himself. \n\n/s",
            "She's the biggest ass clown on TV  news maybe even worse than Joe Scarborough .",
            "How the hell can people be so demented? This racist pos person should just go away.",
            "Just goes to show you the echo-chamber they want to keep Dem voters in. These stories need to be so viral that the Left can't ignore them.",
            "Yeah.. sweep that shit under the rug so we can focus on how bad trumps policies could hypothetically be. /s",
            "Um not reporting things is bad. They are just afraid of the truth.",
            "Well this proves 2 things about the Democratic party.  They are the party of child rapists and fruit cakes.",
            "Wasn\u2019t this absolute loser supposed to be losing her show? Am I imagining this?\nDue to low ratings I believe - how is she still on the air?",
            "More than commenting... actually laughing at the Fox News coverage. \n\nActually laughing.",
            "That's pretty low, even by their standards.",
            "It's (D)ifferent.\n\nThese people ghouls and are so removed from reality that it it is despicable. \n\nSame as Biden referring to the young girl murdered by an illegal migrant as \"an individual\" instead of saying her name.",
            "They are showing their true colors and they know that Trump will win so they are getting ready for a 4 year long insurrection and gaslighting fest where they basically become domestic terrorists because they don\u2019t have their guy in the presidency while they use the media to gaslight everybody about everything that they can think up a way to benefit from somehow.\n\nThere major tactic is to punish the entire electorate for voting against their party.",
            "They don\u2019t care or see the problem. It\u2019s insane",
            "They ignore them and will just tell you white people commit crimes too. \n\nThey don\u2019t even understand border security is not about race. The left is so far gone they do not care about borders"
