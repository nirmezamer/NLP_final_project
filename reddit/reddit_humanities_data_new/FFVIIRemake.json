I understand they had to take all of our materia and equipment away in order to start a brand new game, but having no story explanation is jarring. We left Midgar with loads of materia and gear, it should have been mentioned.\u00a0\n\n\n20 seconds of Barrett screaming that \"Those damn Shinra assholes confiscated most of our shit at that checkpoint...\" Or someone saying we left in such a hurry we could only take what was essential, or something.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's just gone and we aren't talking about it is a weird approach.\u00a0",

I was trying to find it online and I wasn\u2019t sure which one was the correct order as they said some mobile games or old versions were in between this.

Sometimes it's available to use and sometimes not. I feel like I'm missing something obvious?\n\nEdit: I'm also paranoid about the relationship stuff. I really want to go on the date with Aerith but I feel bad picking dialogue options that make the other chars sad. I'm trying to 100% everything I can per chapter so I  don't want to skip quests either. Is there like one or two \"big\" things that I can pick Aerith for to guarantee her date? Or should I just giving the other chars bad answers?\n\nEdit 2: Another dumb question, but sometimes I'm able to use the synergy skills when I hold R1 on a char, but sometimes it's not an option I can pick even when I hold R1. Is there a reason for that?",

I know its by a girl named Endigo, and I checked her Insta/Fbook (don't have Twitter), and neither her or anyone in the comments really said anything about the title. Using Google Assistant to identify the song from YouTube videos doesn't really help either.\n\nThis game has so many songs and tons of bangers so I really don't want to check each one individually. Thanks in advance.",
            "What party setup are people using?\n\nI'm liking Cloud, Barrett, and Aerith. Barret's lifesaver ability is great while Aerith is in the back nuking everything. It's too bad they don't have more synergy skills together.  Most of Barrett's synergy skills seem to be more with Red and some with Tifa/Cloud.",

Which do you think would work out better? \n\nIf the story is basically the same then I'd probably prefer just to do Rebirth, but if there's substantial meaningful differences I'm erring towards OG?\n\nThe main reason I'm asking is because I probably preferred the storytelling in Remake over OG Midgar (there weren't many differences), just because more time was spent on it so reveals had more impacts, but if I'm more likely to appreciate Rebirths story after doing OG first I'd rather go that route.",

I noticed that each open zone has battle version of their themes when the combat starts, but I'm in ch. 7, and I haven't seen a fairly conventional rendition of the regular battle theme except for against the Midgarsksndfkdsjnfkds. The original boss theme, on the other hand, plays for each secret zone boss. The main battle theme is kind of \\*the\\* music of FF7 to me, so I'm hoping it'll be used prominently and regularly later in the game.",

My first impressions (I'll try to get the bias off - I'm loving the game because of nostalgia factor, but the game has some issues)\n\n- Amount of filler is sometimes annoying\n\n- Umbalance between sequences of minigames and open-world and fighting (I need whole chapters of fighting, the middle game section is very linear and minigame oriented. But I'm enjoying them!!). \n\n- The Menu is sort of slow, and I wish we would have a system of swaping entire rows between characters (rows being either the weapon row loadout or the bangle row loadout) because I've got like ONE strategy lol and I keep switching between the same combinations of materia depending on who the game locks in my party during a story section.\n\n- Upgrading weapons don't make much sense\n\n- I ended up dating Aerith , but I wished so much I dated Red XIII. I'll need to replay the entire game in order to get that, I hope my Dog doesn't mind.\n\n- Barret's story fleshed out is really interesting and even better than in the original\n\n- Gold Saucer is incredible. I know weapons are not available in this game, and I'm kinda pissed, I really expected them to be optional bosses at the end of the campaign. I cannot believe they'll make them \"mandatory bosses that you can beat on easy mode\" on part 3, this bothers me. Besides having to build up the entire party and materia again in part 3, this is gonna be tiresome. I really think part 3 should be called \"Rebuild\" and change the battle system and materia completely, a 3rd repeated game leveling up the same material will be terrible.\n\nSo far so good, my OP party is obviously Cloud, Aerith and Red, although I know that a even OP'er party exists in Barret and Yuffie, but Barret is just tooooo OP with lifesaver, auto-protect, auto-regen, chakra and 5% more healing (folio), plus a bunch of HPup's and this is just a beast while Yuffie gathers foes around and casts magick / or / hits them at the same time. Tifa is also OP, but I don't want to use the SAME party from Remake, so I'm sticking to red XIII and eagerly awaiting to play with Kit Seth (which I never got to proper learn how to pronounce until yesterday.)",

Largely same overall story with some massive additions and some alterations.\n\nRebirth does do a generally better job at expanding the story though, rarely does it feel like they\u2019re trying to pad your play time, and if it does, it\u2019s usually optional content. Side quests are great, loads and loads of mini games, and imo they handle the new story elements better than they did in remake. The game also does manage to improve on the plot of this section in the OG too, at least making it feel more natural and integrating certain characters and aread into the narrative better. Combats an improvement on remake.\n\nOn the flip side, there\u2019s a handful of \u00a0places and things I prefer in the OG. OG still feels grittier and Sephiroth is still more menacing, one small town area was done dirty (thankfully it\u2019s pretty minor), the open world stuff is mostly great but some of it isn\u2019t and all the checklists they have mean it needs some willpower to just do what you actually want to and not anything else.\n\nDid you enjoy remake or OGs handling of that story segment more? If remake, I\u2019d just do rebirth. Playing the OG still gives a different perspective but it\u2019s stuff that will eventually be covered in part 3 anyway. You could do rebirth and then play OG if you need more, it\u2019ll be fun to see the differences and you get to see the original plot to the end, plus you can always go back and replay the remakes before part 3 and have a new perspective (hard mode is also absolutely fantastic might I add)",

            "If Weiss is casting Immaculate End, you're taking too long.  The goal is to beat Weiss before the 4 minute 30 second time limit.  He will constantly cast Immaculate End after this time period if by some chance you survived the first one.  You have to be much more efficient in the earlier two phases to make sure you can finish him off in the third.  This fight is all about efficiency both in battle strategy and equipment setup and there is extremely little room for error.  There are various ways to do this, I'll just post the method that worked for me.\n\nMake sure to stagger him once in each phase.  You have to do at least a third of his life per stagger (since that is the only time he takes damage) and force him to his next phase as soon as possible.\n\nMy team was Cloud, Aeris, Tifa.  Cloud had ATB Assist on (maxed), Tifa has ATB boost (you can switch this around, but put ATB assist on whoever you plan on controlling).  Make sure everyone has a maxed Blizzard Materia.  My goal is to make sure that Aeris has two bars of ATB by Stagger time.  Build up Bar with Cloud appropriately (and dodging Weiss's attacks, of course), and Focused Thrust/Strike Weiss every time you pressure him.  Whoever you have ATB Assist on , make sure to double Focus Weiss to give your teammates bar.\n\nWhen staggered, have Aeris do Ray of Judgement ASAP.  Then Arcane Ward right after.  While this is happening, Cloud and Tifa should be pounding the shit out of Weiss.  For Tifa, there's a combo you can do if you have ATB Boost on her as long as you have 2 bars to start:\n\n*  True Strike > ATB Boost > True Strike x2 > melee (fill up a bar) > True Strike.\n\nMake sure that Cloud is using all his ATB for offense.  This is going to be your pattern for both staggers.\n\nWhen Weiss stagger is almost over (around 10% remaining), have everyone cast Blizzaga from the Arcane Ward.   Aeris should be casting this during the last 10%, let Cloud and Tifa keep working on him.  The idea is that Aeris is using Cloud and Tifa to mask her cast time so that the Blizzaga traps Weiss in place right when he gets out of stagger and in his second phase.  Then you have everyone casting Blizzaga from the Ward to keep him trapped until he is staggered.  Repeat said punishment into 3rd phase.\n\nThird phase is the trickiest.  You have to make sure you dodge everything he throws at you and pop in hits when you can.  Pressure him every time you can, and use a Focused attack each time.  I preferred to control Tifa here due to her incredible dodge.",

If your supporting character is locked in something (casting a spell, bound by a grab attack, etc.), your active character is locked in animation on waiting for support character and you have to wait out the time before you resume control.\n\nFor Synergy abilities, using them in certain circumstances can sometimes invalidate part of the buff (for example, using a Stagger Extension when the enemy isn't staggered, or if a limit raising Ability is being used with a character who is already at his max raised limit level).\n\nAlso using the same ability repeatedly will require a higher ATB action cost for subsequent uses.",

If all the worlds are going to converge as he claims, if he succeeds in calling the Meteor in even one reality then he can hit all the worlds with it whether Aerith is alive or dead in any given reality. \n\nIn theory anyway.

You may even find the build-up to the ending of Rebirth more exciting if you know what may or may not happen in this odd remake/sequel hybrid. Up to you though. You seem to have a good attitude, so you'll probably enjoy it either way.

I feel the twist that he works for Shinra is talked about too early in Rebirth.!< \n\nThere's another part that I'm not sure if you've seen yet regarding a conversation between Zack and Marlene, which I feel is the biggest spoilery thing in Rebirth besides the Chapter 2 >!Tifa saying that Cloud wasn't in Nibelheim.!<\n\nI'm glad you enjoyed it, and that I didn't steer you down a bad path. Also impressed by how much progress you made in three weeks lol!"

Spoilers that come later in the game *should not* be referred to in earlier chapter threads. \n\nWe have created a list with an arbitrary number of chapters as some consider the number of chapters to be a spoiler. Do not post that we have created more chapters than there are actually, do not post the number of chapters in any of these discussion threads except the End Game Discussion thread.\n\nA breach of any spoiler warnings or rules in place will result in a ban until after the launch window of the game. Any posting of leaked content which could breach copyright laws will result in a ban.\n\nWe hope that you all have fun playing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and let's all make the effort to make this a safe space for the community to participate while they play the game, however far they've made it through.",
