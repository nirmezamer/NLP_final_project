            "Having the belts not as separate things will be a HUGE improvement. And handing over stuff to the GPU is good news as well. I would love to have my GPU do more of the work.\n\nSo the CPU will be less of the bottleneck. Not having issues with speed yet, but I imagine that will happen.\n\nThe cutting of grass not happening is a good thing.\n\nTo be honest, I do not care about the load times. This is not a game that I play for 10 minutes. So it bothers me less. It is nice if it is faster, but if not, meh. Same for save times. I had 2.5 minutes in my previous save. Not an issue, as I set mine to 1 hour.\n\nI believe that 5 minutes autosave with only 3 autosaves is not a good thing as solving an issue takes easy longer than 15 minutes and then all your autosaves are overwritten. So either go for longer times by default or more autosaves, or both.\n\nBut optimisation id often not a bad thing.\n\nThanks Snutt. Helps a lot.",
            "**Fantastic Game News**\n\nI love to hear information about game getting improvements and this video will make Pioneers very happy.\n\nWHAT IS IN VIDEO\n\n* [Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIKjR5jVv9Y) - Opening comments by Snutt.\n* [Embracer Announcement](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=40) - Snutt talks about [this press release](https://embracer.com/releases/open-letter-by-embracer-group-ceo-about-the-transformation-into-three-standalone-publicly-listed-entities/) which describes the reorganization of Embracer Group, which owns Coffee Stain Holding, which owns Coffee Stain Studios (CSS).\n   * Embracer Group is splitting up into 3 separate companies.\n   * **The reorganization is not expected to affect CSS, nor the Satisfactory Game Development or Version 1.0 Release.**\n* [State of Development](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=106) - Snutt talked about the Closed Beta, currently ongoing. They have had about 1000 Closed Beta Participants playing and overall the feedback has been positive.\n   * Any issues or bugs are being noted and will be addressed during Gold Stage (Game Polishing) prior to release of Version 1.0.\n\n---\n\n**Game Optimizations in Version 1.0**\n\n* [Intro / Key Note](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=157) - Performance is directly tied to your Game PC stats and so while some might see performance improvements, others perhaps not so much.\n* [Foliage](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=191) - The \"colliders\" for various types of Foliage will be removed from Vehicles, which means you can't destroy *most smaller foliage* by driving a Vehicle over them.\n   * This change will improve performance on Dedicated Servers by reducing the amount of RAM used.\n   * This change will also improve level streaming and reduce stuttering.\n   * Foliage that requires at least a Chainsaw to remove will be still be able to be destroyed by running over with a Vehicle.\n   * Determining what Foliage is destroyed, and what is not destroyed, by a Vehicle is still being tweaked.\n* [Belts and Pipelines](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=289) - In Version 1.0 all Belt (and Pipeline) individual segments will be \"pooled\" into one [instance group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_(computer_science)) or \"pool\" thereby reducing the CPU computational load.\n   * This means that both Belts and Pipelines will part of bigger \"instance pools\", reducing the number of instances to be checked, and will be more reliant on the GPU to do most of the computational heavy lifting.\n   * [Shadow Rendering](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=328) will improve because like Belts and Pipelines, shadows will also use bigger instance pools allowing for faster computation.\n   * Manifolds, which are often made up of multiple belt segments, will benefit from this change of using bigger \"instance pools\" by reducing the computational load needed.\n   * The use of Nanite on Belts was tested, but the final decision was to use the bigger instance pool method. **Nanite for Belts and Pipelines will not be used.**\n* [Lightweight Actors](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=373) - Certain Buildable's that don't produce items, nor are interacted with by the Player, are being converted into \"Data Only Objects\".\n   * Common examples of \"Data Only Objects\" are Foundations, Walls, Railings, Stairs, etc.\n   * In Version 1.0 (and after) they will only store crucial information, like location, graphic mesh, customization data (colors, materials, etc.), and the recipe used to build them.\n   * Since all this \"Data Only Objects Data\" will be stored in a single location in memory, writing it to your Game Save will be faster which means Autosave \"delays\" and Manual Save times will be shorter.\n   * Additionally Load Times will be faster, and Save Files will be smaller.\n   * Also this will improve Multiplayer as it decreases the amount of data that needs to be shared resulting in Clients being able to join quicker.\n* [Memory Optimization](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=521) - By removing unneeded data, or old test data, and other stuff, will lower the VRAM requirements for everyone.\n* [Scalability](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=542) - Making changes from a lower setting to a higher setting, or vice-versa, were improved.\n* [Unreal Engine 5.3](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=556) - Version 1.0 will be using Unreal Engine 5.3. This will result in some performance improvements due to Epic fixing some issues in UE 5.2, and also had the benefit of fixing some game crashes that Players were experiencing.\n   * [**Unreal Engine 5.4**](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-4-is-now-available) **will not be used in Version 1.0** but *may be considered in a future Update.*\n* [Upgraded Upscaler's](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=589) - Both Nvidia Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), and AMD FidelityFX\u2122 Super Resolution (FSR) have been upgraded to their respective latest versions.\n* [Dedicated Servers](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=602) - In a [previous video](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1bqp8mj/comment/kx4migg/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) *(Video Bookmarks)* the  improvements to Dedicated Servers in Version 1.0 were discussed, but when it comes to optimizations, in addition to the changes to Foliage, Belts and Pipelines mentioned earlier, Dedicated Servers will also now have the ability to do level streaming\n   * This means you don't need everything on the Map loaded all the time which means if you have a group of Co-Op friends all grouped in one area only, then only *that part of the Map* is loaded.\n* [More Optimizations Planned](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=651) - In addition to those optimizations mentioned in this video, more are planned between before Version 1.0 is released.\n* [Q&A: How About More Videos?](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=660) - Due to Closed Beta and lots of other behind-the-scene efforts videos have been slow to release, but that is expect to change in the near future.\n* [SHOCKING: No Beany Cap / Outro](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=689) - Snutt realized he did not wear his normal Beany Cap.\n   * *That explains why I was confused whom was talking.* \ud83e\udd23\n\nThanks Snutt, this helped a lot. \ud83d\ude01",
            "Oh man, if this improves save times, that's huge. I had to turn autosave way down because it just took so much time.",
            "Great to hear about all of the optimizations. The impact the foliage collision change has on vram is impressive should make anyone with 8GB cards very happy.\n\nThe cpu performance and save file improvements will be nice hopefully this means that save game stutter/lag will be much less noticeable until hopefully late game. \n\nMy only wish is that they would give us a hint on release date.  I have been holding off on starting a new save but if I know 1.0 will not be out until Q4 I would probably start a new game vs. if 1.0 is going to come out in late Q2 or early Q3.",

            "The changes to belts and pipes are interesting.  I do wonder if that has the potential to introduce new and subtle maths problems though?  I know other developers who've looked at moving some calculations from the CPU to the GPU, but decided against it due to accuracy problems. I think that might have been a lack of support for double (rather than single) precision data types though, which I'd doubt that games use anyway for performance reasons.\n\nHopefully this is thoroughly tested and any new glitches are caught.  On the other hand perhaps the focus on those calculations will have helped sort out some of the previous problems, so I guess it could also be a benefit.  I also wonder if calculating the belts as a single entity might help avoid the slight glitch in item movement that can occur at joins?",

            "That belt optimization he mentioned, that handling multiple linear segments of belts together instead indiividually, i've done that in sfticks, when I was bored enough to write a simulator for the mechanics. He also mentions handling manifolds this way, so probably they are reducing bigger DACs into multiple smaller ones, and running the computation in parallel. This was also something I've been doing in the above simulation, just on on the GPU. Good to see similar ideas implemented :)",

It's hard to pre-plan for 1.0 if I don't know how many resources a node is going to spit out, or in what form.",

            "Biggest build I've seen so far. Seems legit that it takes a while to save.",
            "O.o -- I... I had no idea. (New player)",
            "Then you are the outlier at this moment.",
            "No, he's clearly a time lord. As if the name didn't give it away.",
            "Yeah, m.2 SSD. Save file is huge, 30+ MB, that's the issue. The actual hard drive writes aren't a big part of the save time, mostly it's spent doing whatever calculations and compression are necessary prior to the actual file write.",
            "SSD is irrelevant.  The delay isn't due to actually writing to the disk.  Copying one of my saves to my nearly 15 year old spinning rust drive is basically instantaneous.  I first started finding the autosave interruptions noticeable when they were still small enough to fit on a floppy disk.",
            "Load time is pretty similar to save time, I imagine because a similar process is necessary to uncompress the save file data as is required to compress it.",
            "You are correct, disk I/O will not be the bottleneck for this. Even if the programmers saved the file the slowest way possible, the OS does write caching so that the output goes to ram, and is then written to disk as efficiently as possible.\n\n(There are edge cases, of course, but there always are.)",
            "Mine was 26MB and took around 2.5 minutes last time I checked it.\n\nThat also means you most likely are already in need of the change of the UnrealItem. You are also an outlier, just like me, with the size of the save, I would not mind if the save happens faster, but for me it is not a priority.",
            "I'm just starting to mess around with trains between my first few bases. Auto saves are 3 seconds. You people all sound insane or like you must be playing on Ataris. I have no idea what I've gotten myself into.",
            "Man you are hardcore players.\n\nI thought I had a lot going on in my map but auto saves never took more than a second or two. Not on a top spec machine either. \n\nFor a save to take minutes, bloody hell that must be a mega-map.",
            "Yeah no question I'm an outlier. I don't expect my autosave times on a save like that to be *short* per se, but right now they're too long imo. While 4-5 minutes is obviously extreme, my autosaves were into the 30-60+ second range long ago in my save, which is already quite a long hang time.\n\nI think the reason mine are longer than yours is that you do a lot better decoration than me. I think my raw production numbers in terms of items/minute are a lot higher, and it's saving the item state (every belt segment needs to be properly saved with its item positions) that really blows up save times, I think.",
            "The most I heard was 30+ minutes to load the game (or  an hour or more. I forgot). No auto save and he found out that there was a limit on the file size for the save file of 4GB, I think.",
            "This was exactly my thoughts. I got some factories going but nothing major and my autosave is whatever the default is and takes a second or two to actually save. I barely notice and probably wouldn\u2019t notice if the tooltip didn\u2019t pop. Granted I\u2019m only about 50 hours in and just passed Tier 6 (I think; the ones with trains/gas masks).I literally just unlocked Fuel Generators which are SO much better than coal and I need to make a whole bunch of these so I can upgrade all my lower tier items and scale up.",
            "Yeah, the save in question is using the entire map, doing 60/40/60/10 of the final space elevator parts. [This](https://imgur.com/a/OtUDtHH) is the world map."

Snutt mentioned there were changes to Resource Nodes, rebalancing existing recipes, and has information about progression and existing Game Saves.\n\n* [Version 1.0 Release Date?](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=40) - We will find out soon. They do plan on announcing it well in advance, so stay tuned.\n\n* [Changes To Resource Nodes](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=70) - There will be **a lot of NEW Resource Nodes** and there has been *alterations to existing Resource Nodes* which have been either moved, changed purity level, and **some current Resource Nodes will be GONE in Version 1.0.**\n\n   * They have been wanting to make these changes for quite some time, but waited for Gold Stage (game polish) to implement them so as to not mess up existing factories.\n\n* [Specific Node Changes / Northern Forest Biome Warning](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=108) - Snutt talks about specific Resource Node changes, and mentions **a lot happen in the *Northern Forest Biome***.\n\n   * [Northern Forest Pure Node Bonanza No More](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=132) - The \"Pure Node Bonanza\" that *was* on the Northwest edge of the *Northern Forest Biome* **is being dismantled** with some moved, some given Purity Level changes, and some just plain gone.\n\n* [Sulfur Node Changes](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=157) (See Map) - The three Sulfur Nodes have changed with one removed and the two remaining changed to Impure Nodes. Additionally two other Normal Sulfur Nodes from *Snake Tree Forest Biome* and *Swamp Biome* have been removed, but **MORE New Sulfur Nodes** have been added.\n\n* [Caterium Node Changes](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=195) (See Map) - Mostly the same as now. The *Northern Forest Biome* Caterium Node has been removed, and another Caterium Node close by has been moved slightly. Additional Caterium Nodes have been removed from Western **Jungle Spires Biome**, *Desert Canyons Biome* and the *Swamp Biome*. \n\n   * The *Swamp Biome* will now get a new cluster of 3 Sulfur Nodes (1 Pure, 2 Normal).\n\n   * Additionally **MORE New Caterium Nodes** have been added.\n\n* [Quartz Node Changes](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=228) (See Map) - A lot of the Quartz Nodes in the *Titan Forest Biome* have been removed and replaced by 1 Pure Node and 2 Normal Nodes also in the *Titan Forest Biome*.\n\n   * The 2 Pure Quartz Nodes on the Western edge of the *Northern Forest Biome* have also been removed and replaced by 2 impure nodes more centrally located within the Northern Forest Biome*.\n\n   * Additionally **MORE New Quartz Nodes** (1 Pure, 1 Normal, 1 Impure) have been added to the *Southern Forest Biome.*  \n\n* [Changes to Purity Levels of Other Resource Nodes](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=262) - In addition to the changes to Sulfur, Caterium, and Quartz, there have been changes to *other Resource Nodes* with most of the changes being moving Nodes from Normal to Impure Purity.\n\n* [Changes to Coal](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=275) (See Map) - Snutt talks about changes made to Coal Nodes, with removal of Pure Coal Node in Northwest edge of the *Northern Forest Biome* and two Normal Coal Nodes in the *Eastern Dune Forest Biome*.\n\n   * Additionally **MORE New Coal Nodes** have been added to extreme Northwest *Rocky Desert Biome*, along with *Jungle Spires Biome*, and a **extreme amount of Coal Nodes** added to the *Dune Forest Biome*.\n\n* [Iron, Copper, and Limestone Nodes](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=309) (See Map) - Snutt mentions large sections of the Map have been sprinkled with **MORE New Nodes** *(which was not discussed).*\n\n   * Three Normal Iron Nodes in the *Titan Forest Biome* have been removed and replaced by a cluster of 3 Normal Iron Nodes.\n\n* \ud83d\udea9 [Geyser Changes Made](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=338) (See Map) - Snutt talks about changes to Geysers *(used for* [*Geothermal Power Generators*](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Geothermal_Generator#Usage)*)*. Nothing was removed, however **MORE Geysers have been added all over the Map** meaning *Geothermal Power can be a viable consideration for Power Generation.*\n\n   * They increased total number of Geysers from 18 to **30**\n\n* [Uranium Node Changes](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=352) - Mikael steps in to discuss Uranium Nodes. The Normal Uranium Node in the *Swamp Biome Cave* is being nerfed down to a Impure Node.\n\n   * Additionally **a NEW Impure Uranium Node** has been added to the *Dune Desert Plateau Sub-Biome*.\n\n* [Bottom Line - You have MORE Resource Nodes](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=382) - Snutt emphasizes that overall there will now be MORE Resource Nodes *of every type* despite all the changes.\n\n   * \u2605 [View All Resource Node Change Maps](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S2oJxzkoVoFhBPzqgZc9ted9GoeUDK0R) (Google Drive).\n\n* [Recipe Changes - Super Computers](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=405) - Super Computers will no longer be part of the MAM Caterium Research Tree, and no longer needed to make Programmable Splitters or Geothermal Power Generators which will instead need AI Limiters and High-Speed Connectors respectfully to enable use of Geothermal Power Generators on all those new Geysers added. *Mikael jumped in to correct Snutt*.\n\n* [Reasons Why Recipe Changes Were Made](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=459) - Snutt mentions that the made changes to allow those in Early Game to Mid Game have access to some of the \"fun\" stuff, and to make their use more of a consideration for Factories.\n\n* [QoL Changes Made](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=487) - Snutt talks about several QoL changes made:\n   * The Gas Mask will now will be unlocked in the MAM Mycelia Research Tree instead of Tier 5.\n   * The Jetpack will be available in Tier 5, Milestone 1 and will not required Oil Production.\n   * Tier 6, Milestone 1 will now include the Truck instead of the Fuel Generator which was moved to a **new Milestone** *(unnamed)*.\n   * \ud83d\udea9 BIG CHANGE is that Trains and and Fuel Generators will no longer require Computers or Heavy Modular Frames making them accessible without using a Manufacturer.\n   * \u2605 Heavy Modular Frames are no longer used for Buildings in Tier 5 and early Tier 6, and Computers are not used in early Tier 6, both of which will be used to unlock items in Tier 7.\n   * Also Circuit Boards and Electromagnetic Control Rods are NOT used to **unlock** Buildings, or anything for that matter, *but will still be used in Recipes.*\n\n---\n\n**Continued on additional Reply Comment below** \u2b07",

            "In terms of biomes, Spire coast and the swamp got some upgrades as they now have a much better balance of high tier resources. Rocky desert now has a better spot for coal power on the north west coast. \n\nHMF and computers got a bit easier and also not as much needed for buildings anymore. That means you need way fewer in phase 3. But you need a lot more in the late game because radio control units require twice as many now. \n\nFuel generators got a 40% buff and I don't understand why. \n\nI quite like the changes in general, I wonder what the story elements will be like.",
            "Sounds like some good polishing. Nothing too distracting and not overly dumbed down. I would have suspected some more nodes in the Spire Coast, towards the ocean, but perhaps that comes with the SAM Ore and the like.\n\nSo I am now leaning more towards playing U8 until [some mods](https://houghi.org/standard-general-idea-and-mods/) I really would like to have, are updated.",

            "Love all of these changes, but especially that trains will come *much* earlier, which was sorely needed.  It also finally looks a lot less terrible to start in the Grass Fields.\n\nMy only remaining gripe about the game is the alternate recipe grind, RNG, and perhaps most importantly, the time it takes to unlock them in the MAM.  It's literally the only building that I know of where you can't simply build more of them to speed things up, as building more just added another linked instance of the same building.",
            "Looks like the Southeast lake might be the new megabase haven with all the new coal and other materials nearby.",
            "I'm kind of confused about the bit on fuel generators - generators make more power for the same fuel, but then he suggests deleting or underclocking the excess generators in existing setups, but like, wouldn't it just be \"free\" power? Why would you adjust a setup in that circumstance? I first interpreted it as \"fuel generators generate more power, but take proportionally more fuel\" since that would lead needing less fuel generators for the same amount of fuel. (So building less overall)\n\nExcess power generated by a fuel generator shouldn't be a problem (fuel gets burned at a consistent rate, regardless if power is used)  - but I suppose this does make fuel generators a better choice for dealing with the mid/late game power reqs and I might feel a little less inclined to obsessively expand my coal setups every time I have an opportunity to increase mining speed/belt capacity.",

            "Oddly enough, I don't think I'm actually using any of the removed or debuffed nodes in my current save, although the loss of the Caterium node next to the Gold Coast oil nodes is a bit of a pain since I used that quite a bit in my first save.  It's nice to see more resources in the northwestern part of the map though; the resource nodes in the Northern Forest tend to be very concentrated near the spawn area and left most of the northern part of the map empty.\n\nIf there's one thing I'd say about this is that fuel generators might be a bit too OP with these changes, but I guess more power is always a good thing?",
            "I've been waiting for 1.0 and I'm super excited to see my choice to wait was a good one. Looking forward to when this releases so I can dive into the game. My free time will disappear! :D",
            "Those node changes are going to be interesting. Some of them are going to break things I already have, but others look like improvements.\n\nMy plan has always been to continue my existing save since I've put *sooo* much work into it. But this isn't really enough to actually prepare for that. We're still missing two massive questions.\n\n1) What exactly is the Mk3 miner \"\"fix\"\"? Are we getting 1200/min and a massive change to the resource availability? Or something more balanced like 900/min? Or the best option, the troll job with a pinned slider?\n\n2) What changes are being made to the rest of the recipes? Any recipe change propagates through the entire production chain and recipe tree.\n\nIt'd be really great to get answers to these in advance of the release date, even if it's only a week or two out.",
            "Really happy with the changes, Northern Forest always seemed a little too obvious for being a prime late-mid game area, in addition to being such a strong starting location.\n\nMy favorite area, Rocky Desert, is benefitting a lot from these changes. The extra coal makes the midgame require a lot less travel and the addition of Caterium/Quartz/Sulfur makes the M.A.M. a lot more accessible early on.",

Probably I can just shut it down with the increased power my fuel generators will produce though (I'll gain over 30 GW of oil power and don't use most of my nuke plants 50GW output).\u00a0\n\n\nEdit: the loss of nodes to the aluminium factory is going to take the waste reprocessing offline too.",

From what I've seen, nodes only enable you to place a miner, once the thing is placed it will mine whether or not a node is there. So there's a good chance if you plop down miners on those tasty sulphur-, quartz and caterium nodes that are going to vanish, the miners will continue to mine even after the nodes have been removed.",

In particular, though I had previously never focused on it as a thing that needed attention, pushing trains down the tech tree to make them accessible earlier is a \\*great\\* change.  Up to U8, I never used them at all until end game.  You get the \\*tech\\* tolerably early, but because of the high requirements in terms of computers and heavy modular frames, it never made sense to use them until you already had pretty beefy, well developed production lines (i.e., in or approaching end game).  But trains are a logistics backbone, so that's a bit silly.  A developer that didn't play or care about their own game wouldn't have recognized this as a problem.  But CSS did.

The sulfur nodes near the swamp are especially frustrating because their presence and the uranium (which also got nerfed) were why the Swamp was worth the hassle of it being awful to explore, awful to build in without just making your factory a bunch of floating platforms, and just plain unpleasant to be in with the weird desaturation thing. if it was just the one removal that'd be one thing but with the downgrading by two whole tiers of the other you need to haul in sulfur from another node. If there was one relatively close it'd be tolerable maybe but the nearest one is up in the dune desert's coastline, which is a long way to belt, on awful terrain for trucks, and while you could do it with trains that's a fair bit of work for a fairly small amount of what you'd actually need. \n\nIt all feels really comical in an exceedingly frustrating way when they've talked about not wanting to mess up preexisting factories and the environment by moving the nodes onto the world grid when this change is going to be probably a similar amount of work on the map and is going to be far more harmful to people's factories. It feels like they want people to start a new save by making it so tons of their infrastructure breaks rather than by pitching a compelling enough story to be worth starting over from scratch at this point.",

I don't have a ton of sympathy for HMFs because, annoying as they are, you can get started on them in phase 2, but computers always felt backwards. Oil placement generally forces you to travel decently far from your early factories, and getting computer production online is a big jump in power utilization. However, you need the computers for fuel gens and trains so you need to essentially get your computer plant online before you can comfortably connect it to your base, and power in that chunk of time always feels pretty sketchy.\n\nI'm assuming trains and fuel gens will have prerequisites on early phase 3 (probably circuit boards?) so you still need to go on your big adventure to Oil the same as you do now but can then use the fun toys you get in phase 3 to actually complete the phase rather than treating them as a side project that helps prepare for phase 4.\n\nBasically, right now it's Oil -> Phase 3 Progression -> Power / Train Infra -> Phase 4. Instead, it should be Oil -> Early Phase 3 -> Power / Train Infra -> Late Phase 3 -> Phase 4. Not only should this smooth over phase 3 progression, but it should give people more incentive to build out transportation infrastructure earlier in the game. Having clear and focused goals to accomplish with trains in phase 3 should help encourage players to put them to use. Leaving them to post-phase 3 makes it pretty easy for players to tunnel vision past them in favor of the phase 4 goodies which leaves them very unprepared for the game opening up like it does in phase 4.

            "> trains will come much earlier, which was sorely needed.\n\nI've mixed thoughts on that.  I unlocked trains a long time before I felt the need to build any (I literally had one parked on a short section of rail in sight of my hub to remind me to build some track when I needed it).\n\nThe first time I felt I actually needed it was when bringing together the outputs of my first aluminium and computer factories and some quartz to make crystal oscillators and RCUs.  \n\nThat single train line took me a *long* time to build and is rather ugly.\n\nAs a result I spent some time procrastinating building a better HMF factory (for a break from rail building) and moving/upgrading my motor factory (to free up space that might be a good rail route).\n\nAfter that I realised I was actually only a battery factory away from drones and that they'd serve my logistics needs just fine moving mostly processed, lower volume items (the first thing I used them for was changing how I brought in computers and aluminium casings to my RCU factory, leaving the train just bringing in quartz).\n\nSo while I can see why some people might like trains earlier I found I didn't need them as early as I had them and by the time I did need long-distance logistics drones weren't very far away.  Obviously this will depend on people's playstyles, scales and preferences.   More of a gap between trains and drones might encourage their use for some.  For others having them even earlier might result in even more people on first playthroughs asking why they need them when a belt will do the job, because they're still at a scale where the stations are as big as their factories and a single belt will do the job.",
            "> My only remaining gripe about the game is the alternate recipe grind\n\nThere are two ways around it. Place a MAM when you find a hard drive and run it. Remove the MAM. Go look for the next one. Best to get ALL the alts. That way you get extra inventory as well.\n\nSecond option is to go into AGS and set things to unlock. Ideal if you have found all hard drives before already a few times.",
            "Just between the extra sulphur and increased fuel generator output it'd be an easy place to build turbo-fuel on a scale that made nuclear unnecessary for many players.",

            "The way I understood it, fuel doesn't change its energy value, so if the generator provides more power, it burns more fuel. The same amount of fuel needs fewer generators.\n\nIn this case, underclocking is basically setting the generators to the old version values... the alternative would be bringing in more fuel, which requires more piping. It might not be possible.",
            "> 'm kind of confused about the bit on fuel generators - generators make more power for the same fuel, but then he suggests deleting or underclocking the excess generators in existing setups, but like, wouldn't it just be \"free\" power? Why would you adjust a setup in that circumstance? I first interpreted it as \"fuel generators generate more power, but take proportionally more fuel\" since that would lead needing less fuel generators for the same amount of fuel. (So building less overall)\n\nQuite a lot of extra power too. Just taking my two biggest oil power plants built once I had right recipes available (I have smaller less efficient ones too), would mean my overclocked pure node of diluted fuel (133 generators) and pure node of turbo blend fuel (175 generators) produce over 30GW of extra power.\n\nThose setups weren't sized to produce a certain amount of power, they were sized to fully use a pure node of oil.\n\nMy nuclear setup is only 50GW and I only use a fraction of it's output, with the extra power from oil I wouldn't need it at all.",

            "Check out u/Temporal_Illusion 's comment on this thread.  It's one of the top-rated comments, should be easy to find.  However, in my own words:\n\n**Node changes**\n\nBig picture: more resources, more evenly scattered throughout the map.\n\n* Many nodes have been added, removed, moved, upgraded, or downgraded.  Some of this is to rebalance certain areas that were either dense or bare.\n* Even if some nodes have been removed or downgraded in purity, there are more overall resources of every type available.  Biggest changes seem to be for sulfur, quartz, caterium, coal, and uranium.  Although they have done the \"sprinkle treatment\" for pretty much everything, which I take to mean they've sprinkled in more nodes.\n* Lots more geysers.\n* Changes will be factory-breaking.  Probably best to start a new save.\n\n**Progression Changes**\n\nBig picture: Progression has been smoothed out, especially in Phase 3.  Fun stuff available sooner.  Manufacturers less daunting when introduced.  QOL changes regarding fuel generators and item requirements.\n\n* Supercomputers are no longer part of the Caterium tree.  Programmable splitters and geothermal generators no longer require supercomputers to unlock, which makes them useful earlier in progression.\n* Lots of the fun stuff was locked at end-game, which means by the time you could use it and play with it, you're already done.  Gas mask is unlocked in Mycelia tree so it's available before Tier 5.  Jetpack available before oil processing.  Logistics Mk 4 includes the truck, fuel generator moved to its own tier.  Trains no longer require computers or heavy modular frames, so can be used to start your computer or HMF production.  \n* HMF aren't used until late tier 6, computers not used until tier 7.  Makes it easier to build into those.\n* Easier manufacturer use when first introduced.  Computers no longer require screws, HMF numbers rebalanced to be more \"even\".  Computer usage in other recipes has increased to counterbalance.  Encased industrial beams require less steel, more concrete.\n* Fuel generators are clocked 67% faster.  Requires less space, same fuel.  *This is ambiguous in the video whether they're clocked faster or whether the fuel produces more.  Answers in the Q&A site suggest that it's clocked faster, and the MW/fuel is the same.*\n* Some items will no longer be required for unlocks or buildings, including circuit boards and electromagnetic control rods.\n* Other changes coming, mostly minor tweaks and alternate recipes, but these are the heavy hitters.\n* Changes will have significant effects on production lines.  Probably best to start a new save.\n\n**Story**\n\n* Because of the changes to some of the unlocks, you may need to go back to the MAM and HUB and unlock milestones or other progression items.\n* If you have already progressed through the tiers, you will miss some story triggers.  If you want the full story, probably best to start a new save.  *Which you will probably be doing anyway because of all of the changes.*",

That'll be easy to fix swapping some belts around but halves my power before the drones are set up.\n\nThis breaks my crystal oscillator plant between the rocky desert and northern forest without that quartz, and the moving caterium.\n\nLooks like there's a caterium node purity swap in the dune desert that means I need to flip two train routes. \n\nIt also changes my plan for a future circuit-board and HSC factor near those titan forest quartz nodes.\n\n\nI think this might *help* my aluminum plant depending on the purity of some of the added copper nodes. It also changes my plans for my big motor factory in the Blue Crater but that may actually be simpler with the extra iron added.\n\nOverall I like these changes to the node distribution and it doesn't look *terrible* to fix at this point.

            "I feel like Rocky Desert was only really \"good\" due its to proximity to the western Northern Forest. It had plenty phase 1 stuff lying around (don't all the starting areas?), and then you head over to the Northern Forest area for all the rare resources clumped up in one spot.\n\nAlso, while it has good access to Caterium, it has limited access to Quartz. This historically hasn't mattered much as Caterium unlocked all your early game QoL stuff and Quartz wasn't very useful until later. However, one of the recent patches moved Blade Runners into the Quartz tree which was a big nerf to Rocky Desert as its local Quartz nodes are covered in giant spiders. Right now you can get around this by heading over to the Northern Forest Quartz nodes, but with those moved more east imo Rocky Desert is going to be pretty rough.\n\nI like the Coal nodes getting moved to the west coast, and I feel like that overall makes Rocky Desert more self-reliant rather than just being Northern Forest with extra steps. However, the barrier to Blade Runners is going to suck. If you're comfortable playing without Blade Runners (or fighting giant spiders very early on in the game) then the progression out of Rocky Desert works well. You can either go to the new west coast nodes or Crater Lakes for Coal and then either Islands or Spire Coast for Oil which gives nice options overall for expansion. Moving the gas mask to Mycelia will also help as there's some pretty big (albeit dangerous) areas covered in gas in Rocky Desert.\n\nWeirdly, Rocky Desert also has really easy access to SAM Ore which may or may not change in 1.0 and may or may not be relevant early in the game.\n\nAll that said, Grassy Plains actually got buffed a fair bit in all this. It's the only starting area with reasonable access to the Southern Forest which was now has actual nodes in it - rare ones at that. Easier access to Quartz and more overall Caterium and Sulfur. Going all the way to Blue Crater for Oil should be less of an irritation given there's more stuff along the way.",

I chose the latter, and then never bothered with trains for the entire game other than a single test track to see how they functioned.\n\nThis is in stark contrast this with other factory games I play, like Factorio, where I consider trains an absolutely essential part of that game.

I'm pretty sure they basically already have the needed systems (though I'd need to see the code to be sure, which is highly unlikely they'd let me do).  I wouldn't even be surprised if the old and new versions existed alongside each other in internal builds while testing the balancing of the changes.\n\nI'd agree that adding UI and settings to let us choose per save would require more work and new systems and therefore not be a good idea.\n\nRemoving the old recipes feels like more of a design/gameplay choice than a technical implementation one.  They've even kept an original recipe as a (selectable) alt in the past (\"classic battery\" was the original standard battery recipe).\n\nI'll actually be really surprised if we don't see a mod very soon after the 1.0 that replicates most of the existing versions of changed recipes (though unlike how CSS could probably implement it'd be more likely to need reselection of the recipes in existing machines).",

Snutt stated [here](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=629) *(Video Bookmark)* the Power Output change from 150 MW to 250 MW, **while still requiring the SAME AMOUNTS of all types of Fuel.**\n2. Snutt goes on to say the purpose is that *this change will save space as you need LESS Fuel Generators to produces the SAME amount of Power.*\n   * This is the same as if right now you used Power Shards, only in Version 1.0, the Power Shards won't be needed.\n3. Snutt goes on to say [here](https://youtu.be/fkzumQ1A9Ms?t=645) *(Video Bookmark)* that if using an Update 8 Game Save in Version 1.0 you can, if desired, remove un-wanted / un-needed Fuel Generators OR underclock them to return your Power Generation back to what it was prior to Version 1.0.\n4.

With the buff to generators that's now 16.666GW from that same node with the same amount of generators.  I've never done the calculations on Turbofuel with that, but that alone is enough to power a decent sized factory.",
            "It might mean I'd go for a small turbo-fuel setup next time (just to complete the MAM), rather than an overclocked pure node like I did this time.  Just between my diluted fuel setup and my turbo fuel setup I'd be gaining over 30GW (more counting my smaller, less efficient oil setups).\n\nOther than my smallish nuclear setup I always took the approach of building the best I could at the time from either a node (oil) or group of nodes (the coal hole).  My only repeat design was of the 8/3 coal setup, every single oil power plant was always about producing the fuel a better way or doing turbo-fuel, not just more power.",
            "I only ever maxed one mode at a time.\u00a0 Between ever improving ways of making fuel and then turbofuel I didn't build the same oil.power plant twice before finally doing nuclear just before my\u00a0 ast phase 4 factory.",

            "I only needed 100 coal gens to reach fuel so I'd still say the fuel gens were too weak. Though what I'd've done is double both the power production and fuel consumption. Honestly do not mind the amount of energy fuel currently contains\n\nEdit: also, the geometric mean of 75 and 2500 is 433. If fuel gena generated 433 MW, they'd be 5.8x more powerful than coal gen, and nuclear gens would be 5.8x more powerful on top of that\n\nBut if you do the same thing but with power generation per 1 m^(2) taken up by the generator, it comes out to 273 MW being halfway between coal and nuclear. This is almost exactly halfway between where I'd've put them and where the devs decided to put it.",
            "??? I built 3 separate fuel plants, 100, 100 and 200 generators each. I built one whenever I didn't have enough power to turn on the next factory. When I turned on my nuclear plant, my 1200 power storages drained to 70% before the plant could support itself. If I didn't use storage, I'd've needed 700 fuel gens.\n\nBut you're right, I didn't *need* them. All of my factories are constantly running, because I'm always sinking all overflow. I could've run it all off less than 50 fuel generators and used 4000 power storage to turn on the nuclear plang. But is that the point?",

As said, I also think he means same amount of per time. but there is some ambiguity.",
            "So... no, you don't have another source. I also watched the video.\n\nI believe the video is unclear because almost nobody who plays this game would go out of their way to delete or underclock fuel generators that are still in use. People would only do that if they're no longer needed, i.e., the generators require the same amount of fuel *per power generated* and thereby consume more fuel in proportion to their increased power output. This would make the extra generators genuinely useless as they wouldn't be running any more.\n\nI really appreciate what you do for the community, but I disagree that the video clarifies this point.",
            "Depends on your definition of \"decent\".\n\nMy Turbofuel plant uses two pure nodes for 1200 Crude and 2666.66 turbofuel. 592 generators for 88,800 MW. On top of the 10,000 MW in my separate 'starter' coal grid, and my WIP max Nuclear plant.",

For me it was 40 and I think the last 8 might just have been because I forgot to take a power line with me when looking for oil.  If I'd done that I might have reach fuel power from the 32 generators using the 4 nodes in the \"coal hole\".",
            "In a way for me starting my nuclear setup from power storage (built explicitly for that purpose and charged using nearby geothermal while I built the nuclear parts) was exactly the point.   If I'd built more non-nuclear power production to start up my nuclear I'd have met my remaining power needs (which were fairly low) without needing the nuclear plant.",
            "Why did you turn it on all at once? Do it in stages. What I did was build everything (except the nuclear stuff). Each time I turned something and I got the backlog. So now I have a complete nuclear production with everything, except uranium. And all the machines are running idle, because everything is filled 100%.\n\nThe nuclear inputs was used with a manifold, but with smart splitter at the manufacturer. Say I have 100 manufacturers, I would set the output of the Uranium to e.g. 5% of what I actually will run at the end.  5 manufacturers will start producing, because there is no overflow from the manifold. And all the rest will do nothing. The reactors also are set up with smart splitters. No power fluctuations because they suddenly have nothing and suddenly all get one. So only 5% will be running, but that adds already a LOT  more power.\n\nNext I can do e.g 25% and then 100%. Or I start with 1% and build up from there. You can set it up that you start with enough for only 1. Then 4, 16, 64, 256, ....\n\nNo power storage needed. No extreme extra power needed. Just a bit of planning and I think that is part of the game.",
