            "Hello everynyan!\n\nAs Summer starts again, you can see more rainbows coming out! In the spirit of the season, we've made a new iteration of the pride banner featuring our favorite LGBTQ+ characters!  We hope you like this year's, it was difficult to only choose just enough to fit in one image when there's so many of them! [Here's a link to the banner art for this year.](https://imgur.com/a/HMH3VyW)",

            "I think you\u2019re fixating too much on a ship needing to be definitively canon to have value. \n\nSometime certain ships become iconic parts of a fandom\u2019s history and (for lack of a better word) culture inspite of not being canon. Ex: Dio from JoJos is never explicitly shown to be attracted to men, but that doesn\u2019t stop him from frequently appearing on lists of best gay vampires in anime. The popularity of AumaroXChar was one of key factors that saved the Gundam franchise from early bankruptcy, despite it definitely not being canon. Etc.\n\nYou have to understand for most people, shipping is just a fun thought exercise. They would love it if their ship was canon, but not every ship is a prediction of what people think *is* or *will be* canon.\n\nA lot of people in the Dungeon Meshi fandom (and even many casual viewers) like the way Mercille fawns over and worries about Fallin, and enjoy imagining what they\u2019d be like as a couple. And like it or not, it\u2019s a common enough sentiment to become part of series\u2019s paratext. Yes, it isn\u2019t official, but that\u2019s not really the point; and at a certain point, reminding people that it isn\u2019t canon, or asking them to prove it is canon, starts to sound like NARC behavior."
