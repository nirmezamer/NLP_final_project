Again escalated past my lead and a global tech lead gets on the call.  After being cursed at, he sites out of the CCNA book how the STP topology changes works.  Tells them to go to X vendor and recoup their losses from them because they would plug in their switch as a POC, unplug, plug back in etc for an hour.  None of them could understand the havoc they were causing.  That began my loathing for STP.  L3 ECMP topos for the win.

            "I've primarily worked with Fortinet's SDWAN solution, but as far as I can tell, it's mostly built upon standardized protocols. ADVPN (RFC7018) can be used for underlay with branch-to-branch auto-discovered tunnels and BGP with VPNv4 for routing and reachability (also using communities to steer traffic).\n\nThere isn't any RFCs tying it all together to a neat \"SDWAN package\", but pretty much each of the components are using some sort of standardized protocol, which makes it possible to deploy Fortinet SDWAN at the branch offices and for example a Palo Alto Networks firewall or Cisco router in the HQ/data center. It might not be as sexy as some other SDWAN vendors out there, but using well-known protocols makes troubleshooting and deploying it really easy.",
            "Not really, It\u2019s SLA Performance and application priority typically",
            "The first thing is to define what you mean by \"SDWAN\". As far as I can tell it normally means centralised management (bonus points if its an annoying web ui), semi-automated encrypted tunnels from branches to hub sites, and magic features you don't need.\n\nThe closet standard I've seen for this is DMVPN.",

            "Agreed. \n\nHonestly I moved all of my routers to pure FreeBSD and I\u2019m happier than ever. All important RFCs are implemented and I just modify a single file rc.conf. \n\nI have no idea why people keep buying proprietary routers. \n\nI wish I could have a high performance FreeBSD switch as well.",
            "For simple virtual routers we use debian+frr, managed centrally by SALT. Works and scale well.  Adding something like tailscale/headscale would create a basic \"SDWAN\"  cloud. \nBut can't use same for CPE, There is simple no reasonably priced PC HW which provide VDSL/4G/WiFi in one neat package."

We will have 2 providers.  \n\n1: I am still negotiating with the providers, one local and one Comcast, and still considering other options and figuring out who has fiber in our building. If I want 2x Cisco ASR 1001-x and to terminate both providers to those boxes and each provider is only willing to give us one fiber, is best option to use a switch, one for each provider (I was thinking two of those small cisco industrial switches, assuming they are well designed to run until the end of time under any conditions and don\u2019t take up too much space and power acting as only a 4-5 port switch)\n\n2: we want to separate our datacenter activities from HQ end-user networking, and our lab environment. Being a small shop I do like the idea of just using the ports on the router vs setting up a core switch below that. Basically I\u2019m just setting up small transit networks on each port, and using OSPF from my downstream firewalls/routers. Or am I missing out a bunch from eliminating that core router/switch from the topology?\n\n3: I have read the arista 7280R3 (and possibly some variant of the R2, or others) support full internet BGP tables. Curious if we stepped down to the R series if that is still the case as that would be the max in our price range. Or, how much benefit we lose if we step down to taking partial BGP tables with a default route, especially since I have had a weeks long peering issue with our local ISP - but not Comcast-  a few years back. \n\nSo - this is all a bit new to me in terms of selecting hardware and deploying it. I know how it all works I just don\u2019t have enough experience running a network like this to know what is a bad idea and what is a good idea practically. ",

            "Remember: Firewall ports more expensive than router ports mode expensive than switch ports. When connecting a bunch of stuff, aggregation switches aren't the worlds worst option for several reasons.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1) \n\n-  >> One fiber: \n\n Pair, you mean? Not that it's super relevant. \n\n- An aggregation switch is not a bad way to go, but I would recommend 2x; if the switch goes out you lost all your redundancy. Terminate one router and one provider to one switch, and the others to the others. Mesh the routers to each agg switch in case of switch failure. Less ports you can link the two routers together.\n\n- Hardware redundancy and cheap/easy way to add new circuits, routers, firewalls, cores, or replace any of the mentioned components; it becomes a matter of copying configs ahead of time. Plumbing the vlan(s) from the old device to the new device on cutover day. Minimal downtime, and no fatigue from moving a ton of physical ports around and making sure things match up.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n2) If you have a 'core' device, what is the purpose of it and why is it a 'core'. It sounds like you're terminating internal end-points. If that hardware has a specific feature or purpose (tons of cheap ports, redundant RE/power) it isn't bad to utilize. The 'agg-switch' mentioned in 1) technically works like your core, but that's not it's purpose necessarily. Comes down to your design intentions. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n3) What is the purpose of two providers? If it's simply internet connectivity backup, then you don't care about full tables. If they're similarly connected ASNs, default is sufficient. This is inefficient, though, because now you have an expensive connection not doing anything. Reconsider Default First + Full tables. You may also ask the providers for Default + \"Connected\"/\"Customer\" tables. This way you at least efficiently push traffic to their +1 hop connected networks and reduce your table size. Though, I would say if budget is so constrained full tables is an issue, management needs to be educated on the criticality of your edge/WAN routers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>> I just don't have enough experience running a network like this to know what is a bad idea and what is a good idea practically.\n\nDon't worry about what you don't have - you'll get there. While failures and emergencies are the most common ways people learn about how their networks could be improved, go through failure scenarios/tabletop in your head. Think of ways things could fail by breaking a cable, a provider, or a piece of hardware and game out what the network would do when that happens."
