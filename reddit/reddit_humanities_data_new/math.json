            "Hey there. I figured out what I think is a cool equation, and I was wondering if had a name. Here\u2019s the equation:\n\ny=+-(c1xln(x)+c2x+c3)\nWhere c1, c2, and c3 are constants and c1/=0.\n\nThe reason this equation is cool is that the y-intercept of the line tangent to the equation goes from -infinity to infinity at a constant rate as you move along the graph at a constant rate.\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the first to figure this out, so does anyone know if this has a name? And if so, does it have any practical applications?\n\nA little background if anyone\u2019s curious, I started think about this when I was driving my car a while ago. The driver in front of me was driving terribly, so I wanted to look in their side window and see who was driving. But then they turned at such an angle while I kept going straight, such that I could only ever see the back of the car. Then I started to wonder what curve they would have to take such that I could only ever see the back of their car, assuming we both kept going at a constant speed, and I kept driving in a straight line. And then the above equation is what I got when I sat down to figure it out.",

I'm pretty sure this is a very difficult problem, but does anyone have any insight on how I could solve/approximate this?\n\nIn case it helps, the practical situations I'd use this for would be restricted to n<=20 and only a handful of possible values for r_i (most circles would be the same size, with maybe up to 5 total different sizes). The final result could also be off by a few percent without being an issue, so approximations would already be hugely helpful.",
            "I have started going through John Lee's *Introduction to Topological Manifolds* and wanted to see other examples of solutions of the problem 2-5a) Give two subsets of \u211d^2: X,Y and a function f: X -> Y such that f is open, but neither closed nor continuous. I found this solution on scribd.com:\n\nX = B\u2082(0,0) \\ \u2202B\u2081(0,0), so a ball radius 2 without a circle radius 1 all centered at (0,0). Y = B\u2084(0,0). f is then defined as f(x,y) = (x,y), when (x,y) is in B\u2081(0,0); and (2x,2y), when (x,y) is in X \\ B\u2081(0,0).\n\nIt states that the function is \"*clearly not continuous*\", but I think otherwise. Going off of the topological definition, any preimage of an open ball in Y will either be an open ball in X, or a \"half-ball\" being cut off at the boundary of B\u2081(0,0). However since that boundary is not in X by its definition, the pre-image is still open.\n\nIs the given example wrong or am I missing something?",

Go for it!\u00a0\n\nAs for books, I think any book about proofs like the ones by Velleman or Hammack are appropriate.\u00a0",
            "One possibility you might enjoy is to look at a book on number theory, abstract algebra, or real analysis and walk through some of the proofs at the beginning of the book. These are difficult subjects, but at the start of the book there are usually proofs you can follow with few to no prerequisites. For instance, using the definitions of addition and multiplication of natural numbers, you can prove a variety of properties you learned in elementary school, like the associative, commutative, and distributive properties. I'll give the concrete example of proving that (a+b)+c = a+(b+c) for all natural numbers a, b, and c. We use the following definition of addition:\n\n\n(1) n+0 = n, and\n\n\n(2) m+(n+1) = (m+n)+1\n\n\nfor all natural numbers m and n.\n\n\n\nFirst, let a and b be natural numbers and let c = 0. Then (a+b)+0 = a+b = a+(b+0), by (1).\n\n\nNow suppose (a+b)+c = a+(b+c) for all natural numbers a and b for some natural number c=n. We must show it also holds for c=n+1. That is, we must show (a+b)+(n+1) = a+(b+(n+1)).\n\n\n(a+b)+(n+1) = ((a+b)+n)+1 by (2).\n\n\n((a+b)+n)+1 = (a+(b+n))+1 by assumption.\n\n\n(a+(b+n))+1 = a+((b+n)+1) by (2).\n\n\na+((b+n)+1) = a+(b+(n+1)) by (2).\n\n\n(a+b)+(n+1) = a+(b+(n+1)) by the transitive property of equality.\n\n\nTherefore whenever the equation holds for some c=n, it also holds for c=n+1. And it holds for c=0. So by induction, it holds for all natural numbers c.",

            "Where are you getting line 5 from? It's true that sqrt(1 + (-1)) = sqrt(0) but you can't infer that sqrt(1) + sqrt(-1) = 0; it is in general false that sqrt(a + b) = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).",
            "It's more than convenience. There are natural definitions of exponentiation where 0^0 = 1 is just a special case. For example, a rigorous definition of \"repeated multiplication\" by induction: x^0 = 1, x^(n+1) = x^n x. Many properties of exponentiation can be proved without caring about whether x is 0.\n\nIn contrast, the conventional definition of division via multiplicative inverses (x/y = xy^(-1)) simply does not apply to 0. Extending that definition to 0 would require an ad hoc special case, and then any property of division must have its proof amended accordingly, if it even still makes sense.\n\nIt also depends on the context. 0^0 is not as meaningful if you're looking at exponentiation by real numbers. As a two-variable function, x^y has a discontinuity at (0,0) (x^0 = 1, but 0^y = 0).  Arbitrarily giving a value to 0^0 won't change the fact that you have to be careful about what's going on around there anyway.",
            "We can define an undefined thing if we want. The caveat is that it should make some sort of sense to do so.\n\nFor example it doesn't make sense to define 1/0 in general. The most natural thing to do there is take the limit of 1/x as x tends to 0 but this gives answers that disagree so undefined is better than picking one in general. 0/0 is even worse in this regard as you have various ways to get to it. Is it the limit of 0/x or x/x or should we even take something weirder like 2x/x?\n\n0^0 runs into some of the same problems as 0/0 so it is reasonable to say it is not defined either but there are some scenarios where it makes sense to argue it is 1. For example, if you are considering only whole numbers as exponents so x^n is x \\* x \\* ... \\* x and so on then x^0 means the empty product which is always 1 so plugging in zero should still give 1. This means it makes sense as the constant term in a polynomial for example. Various formulae work best if we assume 0^0 = 1 as well such as the binomial formula, differentiating polynomials at x=0, the Taylor series for e^x and so on.\n\nBasically, it is more common for a scenario where 0^0 = 1 is a useful definition so we can use that.\n\nNote this is different to defining 1+1=3 because that definition contradicts our other rules of arithmetic and breaks lots of things while 0^0 = 1 only breaks the rule 0^x = 0.",
            "You're absolutely right that the 'proof' in the video is absolute nonsense. At best, it works as a handwavy justification.\n\nIf we leave 0^0 entirely undefined, which would be the 'default', many theorems end up saying things like:\n> The number of functions from X to Y is |Y|^(|X|) , **and if both |Y| and |X| are zero, it's 1.**\n\n> The derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1) , **and if x and n-1 are both zero, it's 1**.\n\nSo you have a bunch of theorems that all seem to 'naturally' use this special operation that's exactly the same as exponentiation, but *also* gives you 1 at 0^(0). Since 0^0 is not [yet] defined, it ends up making a lot of sense to just... well, define it that way!",
            "One general piece of advice is to think from the point of view of whoever is going to read your proof. You want to make their job, which is to check your proof, as easy as possible. And in one instance, \"the reader\" is going to be \"you\" when you are double-checking your proof.\n\nThe most basic thing is to work on the form of the proof. You don't want to write a wall of text or a wall of formulas. Even if the proof is only calculations, try to be creative in how it is laid out. If every step only does one simple thing, then most likely there are many parts to an equation that remain unchanged at each step, and you could vertically align them to make that clear. If you find yourself repeating something a lot (which, at length, results in being sloppier and making mistakes), that could be a sign that there is a general result at play, so try to state it explicitly and avoid the repetition.\n\nAt a more high level, you need ways to double check your answer independently of how you reached it. A simple case is if you're solving an equation, then you must plug the solution in it and check that the equation holds. If the answer is a number, maybe you can find approximations, or bounds on it. In more abstract situations, look for symmetries or other properties that the solution must satisfy.\n\nLook for ways to visualize the problem. In ideal cases, you can literally draw a picture that illustrates what's going on. In some other situations, you can still give a high level idea of the proof before diving into the details.\n\nTo sum up, intuition is not only useful to come up with a proof, but also to guide the flow of the written proof. That makes mistakes less likely, and convinces the reader (including yourself) that you understand what's going on as opposed to stumbling upon the correct answer by trying things blindly.",

You can add, subtract, multiply, and divide them, and do a ton of mathematics without ever *leaving* the rationals. It makes sense to think of them as a \"space\" you can navigate, in a sense.\n\nThe primes don't have that. We don't have any nice way to combine two primes to get a new one - practically any operation we do to them will give us something outside of the set of primes.\n\nSo it's not very useful to talk about the primes alone - they don't form a nice \"space\" to play around in.",

As far as I've seen the most used unofficial notation is the blackboard P since it's hard to confuse prime numbers and projective space in context.\n- There is a symbol for prime ideals of any ring, Spec.

If we had -sqrt(1) = sqrt(-1) then we would immediately get your conclusion i = -1 without the need to do any of your other steps.

            "Sure, but that's probably the main (only?) reason you'd need a symbol for the set of all primes, in which case you can really just say \"let p be prime\" without needing to introduce a new symbol. Part of why it's useful to have symbols like Z, Q, R is that you often build structures \"on top of\" or \"out of\" one of those sets, e.g. by products, adjoining elements, quotients, or multiple of those operations--think R^n, Z/nZ, Q(i), Q[x]/(x^2 - 2), and so on. In that case having a symbol for the \"base\" set automatically gives you a nice symbol for the new structure. But because (as u/AcellOfllSpades mentioned) the primes don't have much structure, you don't often build new structures out of the set of all primes in the same way, so one of the big reasons you'd want a symbol for the set of all integers, say, is absent for the set of all primes.",

            "I\u2019m a sophomore in high school as well and have not done too much analysis yet, so I might not be the most appropriate person to ask for advice.\u00a0 However, if you are capable of studying proofs, I think doing Calculus before Analysis is kind of unnecessary. If you learn Analysis, you would already have a good grasp of the majority of the material that is taught in a Calculus course. If you only do Calculus however, well\u2026 you would not know much Analysis.\u00a0 Moreover, pretty much all Analysis books don\u2019t assume that the reader has taken Calculus. In fact, most Analysis books are entirely self-contained and include a preliminary chapter on proofs or set theory. See for example, Analysis with an introduction to proof by Lay, Understanding Analysis by Abbott and even the book by Jay Cummings you mentioned.\u00a0 If you are interested in studying physics, however, I would imagine you probably want to be comfortable with computations and perhaps optimization too. If that\u2019s your case, I think the book Calculus by Michael Spivak is the best fit. I have not read much of it, but it seems to lie in the intersection of Calculus and Analysis, computations and rigour. You don\u2019t actually need to learn proofs to start Spivak. You will learn as you progress! (you will eventually have to learn some na\u00efve set theory though) If not, the Jay Cummins books (both on Proofs and Analysis) look pretty fine.\u00a0 Sorry for the long comment, hope this helps.",

Seeking advice on feasibility, areas to focus on, specialization selection, and improving my chances of acceptance.**\n\nI'm considering applying for master's programs in pure mathematics good universities in Europe (excluding the UK), such as Bonn, Uni of Pisa , ETH Z, EPFL, TUM, Uni of Vienna, etc. However, my bachelor's degree focused heavily on applied mathematics, statistics, and some physics.\n\nAcademic Background:\n\nI completed a bachelor's degree in statistics, with mathematics and physics as my minors. My coursework included calculus (including multivariable), linear algebra, differential equations, statistics, and physics (thermodynamics, quantum mechanics etc.)\n\nI'm particularly interested in understanding the following:\n\n- How feasible is it to transition from an applied mathematics background to studying pure mathematics at the graduate level, especially for top universities in Europe?\n- Are there specific areas of pure mathematics that I should focus on strengthening my knowledge in before applying to these programs?\n- Do good EU universities with a low acceptance rate like Bonn, ETH , EPFL etc., welcome applicants with applied mathematics backgrounds who want to pursue pure mathematics?\n- Considering my background, would it be more advisable to apply for applied mathematics master's programs initially and then shift towards pure mathematics if possible?\n\nAdditionally, my counselor has advised me to mention my desired specialization in my SOP as it increases the chances of admission, but since I've just started learning higher level pure math subjects, I'm unsure which specialization to select. Is there a quick and easy way to determine which higher-level math subjects you truly like if you don't know much about them yet?\n\nDo I actually have a chance of getting into these good universities with my current background? Is there anything I can do to improve my chances?

With zero analysis and algebra background, you\u2019d even have trouble being taken seriously by pure math masters programs in the US, not to mention Europe. Even if you manage to get in, you will have an exceedingly hard time surviving the program, since most students will be way ahead of you: their bachelors usually cover the first year of US grad school math if not more. Your math background (minus stats&physics) is covered in European high schools and maybe first year. Even applied math in Europe requires rigorous training in foundational topics like analysis. You should aim for a transitional/remedial masters/postbac program in the US instead. But it is possible that you eventually will rely on your statistical background to get jobs since a masters in pure math doesn\u2019t open many new doors.\n\nOnce you acquire US first year grad level of math (measure theory, algebraic topology, etc) on transcript, then you will have a chance of getting in.

Otherwise you need them to be on your transcript. They have good reasons: there is no way to evaluate your mastery of the materials unless you take it as a structured course with a syllabus detailing the content and evaluation methods. It\u2019s commendable that you have so much passion for learning pure math. You might want to aim for less competitive programs (especially in the US) designed for non-major enthusiasts like yourself."

They skip the homework or copy it off their friends; they mimic the example projects and change like 1 thing; they over-rely on technology; they don't take notes.\n\nThere is value in having a mix, I think. Exams encourage the *automaticity* you need to really succeed in mathematics, and projects give you a better idea of what real-world math actually looks like.\n\nI found your \"capitalism\" comment rather silly because exams are older than capitalism. The first standardized exams go back to the Sui Dynasty (the year 605 CE), long before capitalism even existed. Those imperial examinations were used to select government officials.\n\nIn any meritocracy, you need safeguards against incompetence that cannot be sidestepped, faked, or cheated.

Of all the domains humans endeavor to teach, mathematical ability is one of the easiest to measure and one of the hardest to fake. \n\nEdit: and just to clarify, you are very correct suggesting that many degrees are awarded based on metrics other than actual competency. I'm curious to know if you think it is the method or the system applying the method that's broken.",
            "I think that sometimes people get confused about what exams are testing them on.  If you learn the underlying reasons and methods for something, then you can apply the strategies, algorithms, etc. required for the questions.  If you only learn the algorithms, then yes it will seem like regurgitating instead of learning and being truly tested.\n\nOnce you get to upper-level math classes, definitions become very important and a lot less actual computation is done/tested on.  It might feel like these exams are asking you to regurgitate definitions.  The reality is, these definitions are fundamental to ensuring a proper foundation necessary to understand the rest (i.e. in linear algebra, abstract algebra, higher-level differential equations, etc).",

            "This might be a matter of approach. I'm a CS student, and had to take a few math courses. To this day, I use, apply, and understand every single thing I learned in those classes 3 years ago. Regurgitation feels more like a characteristic of high school math, which doesn't require as much thought and understanding. In my eyes, a good test (such as the ones I took) doesn't benefit from intense memorization, but instead requires an understanding of the subject, which, once formed, tends to stay. The few classes I truly hated during my undergrad were mainly the ones that were just a test of memory (I still have nightmares from Introduction to Operating Systems), but I can still solve a Linear Algebra 2 exam without preparation, since I remember the main theorems, and understand the rest. This is partially dependent on the professor, and of course it's reliant on the curriculum, but if you have a chance to form an understanding of the subject, you can maybe even enjoy mathematics. I know that I might be speaking without seeing the full picture since I'm just an undergrad, but I feel like all you need is one good professor to love the study of math.",

In an ideal world grades would only depend on homework, but it's so easy to cheat these days that if you base grades solely on homework then you're basically creating an arms race between students to cheat more and more. So, there needs to be a way to verify that the work a student is doing is truly their own, and as far as I can tell the only way to really do that is to physically watch the students do the work by themselves.\n\nI've been noticing a little bit of a trend in recent years to start doing away with time restrictions on exams.

If you know your bounds and the kind of integration you're doing, you've done most of the work, and most professors recognize this and give you the bulk of the credit.\n\nIf you're talking about undergrad math, this is a lot of definition memorizations for most of the credit, and then partially how to utilize it.  If you're doing algebra, you're going to write down the definition of your ring group or field etc and maybe what kind of action or object you're looking at such as an annhilator or an ideal and what kind of ideal  etc.  Even for real analysis the bulk of your credit is going to come from your theorem, whether you can use it is a diff story.  However, at the undergrad level how to use it isn't that important.  You can look at a similar problem and if you can replicate the similar process, you're good to go.\n\nat the graduate level is where things will shift.  Ideally you will be doing your own research, and the only distinction from a ph.d is the depth of the topic and well most importantly, if nothing uniquely new comes to fruition, you can still get a masters, but not a ph.d.\n\nKeeping in mind that before you start your ph.d you need to pass qualifying exams and an oral exam.  There are some departments that could forego these, but it is in the students best interest to not do so.

The measure of  success  is usually the quality and the number of publications, not the educational success of their students. Therefore, the exams are often written closed form tests of 90 minutes. That said, during my Master education a head several classes well, the exam was in principle Unlimited Time to prepare the  answer. Of course why some people were preparing the answer, and the other people were discussing their answer.\n\nThe only thing The capitalizm hes to do with this situation is that there are more researchers in science than 50 years ago, especially in fields unrelated to nuclear weapons. This necessitates evaluation schemes, Hirsh indices, index impact factors, etc, and in the long run, 90-minute closed form tests.\n\nThis is a very bureaucratic approach but at least it tries to promote those who are the best. In contrast the Communist way is when, the academic success is dependent on drinking vodka with proper people or claborating with Secret Police.",
            "It's a consequence of capitalism as many things are: there is an incentive for a voluminous mathematical community cranking out results, but there's little incentive for providing mechanisms to really guide and educate upcoming mathematicians. It's always more cost-effective to outsource learning effort to the students themselves, and make up for it with volume of incoming students and filtering through exams. \n\nMath education gets much better at the PhD level (if you have a good advisor, or course) because there you will properly have a guide for your journey. Getting a paper published - getting a few fellow members of the community to recognize that you did something interesting and nontrivial - is the only real proof-pf-understanding that has a paper trail in our current system. Before that it's all proxies like exams and personal judgement from professors on eg your questions in class or in office hours, or in interviews.",

Starting there, the exam really starts by asking you how you got to the solution, which ideas of the lecture were used, maybe about specific theorems or definitions that have something to do with the problem etc.\n\nI always felt like they could ask harder questions in  oral exams because they could always pivot on the fly if they see their student struggle.",

If after spending a significant amount of time with those resources, I look up the answer and seriously just let my eyes wander over it as fast as possible then I try to solve it again.\n\nSometimes this doesn't work and I need to go over the entire solution.
