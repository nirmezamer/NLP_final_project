            "Is there a good guide for Kain mobbing?  I don\u2019t understand the malice system. I\u2019m used to playing DW and am overwhelmed by the number of attacks that Kain has. Which attacks and buffs should I be using?",
            "Is it normal to be too weak to do content? Tera blink + EXP Tickets got me to lvl 230, but I'm struggling in Arcane River. Is the solution just to wait for my daily bosses to drop gear like boots/gloves etc since I only have the CRA gear from boxes? Cause I don't even have Pensalir gear, and am too high leveled to farm it, so I'm assuming like I'd have to wait and do Cygnus until I can get gloves/boots for example?",
            "Anyone know how many frags it\u2019s gonna take to unlock the new mastery core and Janus?",
            "Am I playing Mech wrong or is it super clunky doing MP and arcane dailies",
            "Is anybody else struggling with Epic High Mountain? My character is quite weak (10M CP) and I managed to slog through the first 9 stages (each taking like, 10m each), but I'm barely scratching the final boss. Wondering if I should try and power through or just leave it for a few weeks and come back after I'm stronger",
            "I managed to exchange coins for a Absolab warrior glove on Heroic when I needed a Pirate glove instead, does anyone have experience with Nexon support being able to reverse something like this or is it too minor? I have heard they sometimes are able to give you back items etc if you did something by accident, so I have some hopium before SSF lmao.",
            "I'm not familiar with the flame system but I noticed I have 100 Karma Black Rebirth Flames that expire tomorrow, is it worth spending them on my fake absolab weapon? Rest of my equips are just temporary. Is there some other accessory I should be using these on if not the fake weapon?",
            "Newish player here - I hyper burned a Night Walker due to the various comments and Youtube vids suggesting how good and easy it is to play - however, I am finding it being slow and clunky. I looked up various videos on how to burst effectively  and that seems OK, but mobbing feels really, really bad compared to my main, Dawn Warrior. I know I am supposed to get a cooldown helmet for bite, but is there something else I am missing that might be obvious? I am lv 236 currently.",
            "For SSF:\n\nHow do you tap superior gollux to 21? Push fodders to 22 and transfer, or 21 then tap 20 -> 21?\n\nIs it a good idea to try for 22 for CRA (I am at 21) or tap my other gear first past 17?",
            "Hey guys I just hyperburned a bishop and hit 203 on it and was looking to try another class to main so was looking to delete it to reburn another one. I should be able to get all the boxes and everything again on the new character right? I did accept the first 200 set of burning rewards already but that should be a small thing in the grand scheme of things yes? Was looking to switch to dawn warrior myself.",
            "In terms of cooldown management, is kain similar to ark?",
            "Would you say it's better to hyper burn a low investment character or a high one? Guides give investment as pros and cons of the characters, but I don't remember anyone relating that to burning specifically.\n\nIt looks like Bucc and Bowmaster are low investment types, and NW is more of a high investment one, for example. Also considering WA, Marksman, and DW. Trying to narrow downnnn\n\nJust looking for a fairly straightforward solo bosser that's easy to pick up and not too mechanically intensive for my poor wrists lol - ideally doesn't die super easily and has good mobility in all situations because I have no patience for clunky travel, and isn't going to blind me like BaM, Hayato, or to a lesser extent, Ark. Someone with lots of little hits in a short time would be satisfying, too.\n\nMy main is Luminous and I adore her, but she's a bit lacking in the rapid fire/single target department. And since her mobility and mobbing are so amazing I have a hard time with characters that are too big of a downgrade there, if that eliminates any of my options lol",

            "Okay so 5th job, am I just opening nodestones until I get my perfect trio boost nodes?",
            "How do I get the %stats potentials? Just rolling with cubes and hope for the best or is there ways I can increase my chances?\n\nOr am I just doing it wrong. Slowly progressing gear wise and got myself some Pensalir and hoping the bosses drops the accessories I need.",
            "Any classes that play like Khali\u2019s cooldown style? Paced whackamole low cd skills every now and then.",
            "what is bonking? what event thing do i click to bonk?",
            "Okay guys quick question, SSF is coming up and I\u2019m wondering if I should make a permanent Abso weapon and star force it or just go for the fake Arcane one, if I do that, I could focus my resources in star forcing other abso pieces like gloves and shoulder, a Dom Pendant if I\u2019m lucky, and permanent CRA gear.\n\nAlso, is it worth it to use Reinforced Gollux before getting to Superior? I got kinda lucky and dropped both reinforced pieces in a single run and I can\u2019t even solo Hellux yet. I know that the belt has higher attack than the pink bean one, but the set effect is really useful as well, so I\u2019m at a loss on to do.",
            "I deleted my Hyper burning character yesterday, is the scheduled maintenance going to make it so I have to wait an extra 5 hours on top of everything or does the maintenance count as \"time served?\" \n\nAlso, I will be able to hyper burn a new character with no problems, right? I did accept the level 200 reward so I figure that will be gone.",

            "Hi there! Played a LONG time ago and decided to hop on again for fun. Started fresh in Hyperion, made an angelic buster, and somehow I hyper burned my way to level 233 after 4 or so hours of gameplay. I kind of don't know what's going on with all this v matrix and arcane force (at 90 rn) and whatnot. Where should I go to get a better idea of what I should actually be doing at this point?",

I know dummy can handle many mechanics for me it\u2019s just stats and damage. Managed to struggle party lotus but still did too little damage (I know my gear is very behind for the moment)",

            "Any Battle Mage, Marksman, or Dawn Warrior mains that can help me decide which one to main? I am leaning towards Battle Mage or Marksman because they are more unique and I enjoy the playstyle of ranged characters but Dawn Warrior sounds simpler to play with tons of damage. Will be playing solo most of the time and I enjoy bossing/mobbing but I am looking for a class that is pretty easy to play (not too many keybinds because my wrists suck). I do plan on trying to eventually grind to late game (even if it is years from now). Any advice is appreciated!",

Maybe Reinforced Gollux Belt instead? I have only one though.\n\nWatched Duky's guide on progression and he recommends drop/meso gear, which I've done with the event rings from last event (completed on interactive and claimed most rewards on heroic). Literally got the solid event ring cubes today from the weekly rewards. But I'm assuming making more drop/meso gear can wait until after the shining star force event.

            "Kain uses every attacking skill. And I do mean every attacking skill. Strike Arrow, Shaft Break, Scattering Shot, Falling Sky as well as their Malice versions for mobbing and bossing. Unseen Sniper and Execute skills are used for just bossing. \n\n\nFor mobbing if you\u2019re willing to take some lower rates you can probably just jump around with Strike Arrow and its malice version. For buffs make sure you have your toggles on as well as attack speed booster and Nova Warrior, Decent Sharp Eyes should also be applied if you\u2019re post 200.\n\nTo basically explain the Malice system is as follows:  As you hit enemies, your Malice gauge slowly fills up and eventually becomes a crystal, of which you can have 4 at any time. Using Possession will consume one of these crystals to enhance the next attack used (and apply one stack of Death\u2019s Blessing to whatever is hit which is basically just for bossing as ideally you one shot while mobbing anyway.)",

Some skills, like Falling Dust, will have a number of stacks associated with them too so just be weary of that as you're weaving them in. \n\nAs far as specifics on mobbing, I would definitely check out the Kain discord to see what kind of references they have since Kain is an incredibly active farmer (especially compared to DW) if you're really trying to push the upper limits of rates. Otherwise, you could experiment with relatively square shaped maps that you can find comfortable spots to use Falling Dust, Possess Strike Arrow for long-range platform clearing, Chasing Shot to clear multiple targets every 3-4 rotations, and don't be afraid to use his grappling hook and dash for some extra mobility. You don't have the luxury of very large/passive AoE type attacks but some mobs will get picked off with Dragon Fang and Lasting Grudge.\n\nHope any of that helps! Enjoy the class though, it's one of my favorite mules.",
            "You basically just use whatever has the best hitbox to cover the most area in a rotation.  For low effort mobbing you just use whatever is off cooldown and spam strike arrow. some skills have individual charges which still have a cooldown but you can hold multiple uses with.\n\nMalice system is fairly simple, just think of it as Ammo, using your regular red attacks, it will fill up the gauge. Once the gauge is full it will reload 1 ammo. You can hold up to 4 ammo\n\nThe ammo is for using possession, using the possession key enhances the red attacks into a more powerful version, with a bigger hitbox or special effect. Each time you use a possessed skill it will take one ammo.\n\n You must use the possession key for each time you want to use an enhanced red attack.\n\nThe purple attacks (execution skills) are.primarilt for bossing, there is 1 spammable main attack, and the others have short cooldowns which you rotate between. It's possible to be used for mobbing specifically the one with the larger hitboxes but they aren't the best so generally you can ignore them. Just use the red skills.\n\nHere is an example of a rotation for a specific map. You can see that he only uses skills in certain areas depending on what they can hit, in order to clear all the mobs each spawn wave.https://youtu.be/Rul4PS2sPrw?si=muv4s6DpZ6nLmShQ\n\nfor more low effort mobbing can just spam strike arrow, use the chasing shot hyperskill, and use any of the other red skills off cd. I typically rotate between the. Possession shaft break and possession falling dust, as well as the non possession scattering shot. Make sure to also activate your two toggles, dragon fang and lasting grudge\n\nFor buffs you only need whisperhot booster, Nova warrior. 5th job, standard decent skills, check kain discord FAQ for the list.\n\nFor 5th job the dragon burst and fatal blitz arent super useful for mobbing but can be used for elite mobs\n\nUsing Thanatos descent will give you a buff for 30 seconds that adds additional arrows fire, use the skill again before it's over to do a FMA.\n\nGrip of agony is a short summon you can use to cover an area.\n\n\n Just to explain by using Possession attacks,  on an enemy or boss, you will stack up a debuff called deaths blessing, up to a count of x15. Using the purple skills on the boss with this debuff will do increased damage, and each hit will take up a stack..when your back to zero you have to switch back to stacking up the debuff with possession skills). Since most of the time you kill mobs quickly you don't need to use this on them.",

Then get emblem to legendary with 12% attack or m.attack whichever you need. Along with the secondary. Then I go for absolab. If you\u2019re still lacking on damage you can try to push for 15* or 17* on that gear. \n\nI use magnus shoulder, cht ring and necklace, arkarium mech pendent in the meantime as well.

The extra 15% IED is very important in the long run.\\* \\*\\*\n\nAs for starforcing... conventional wisdom is to SF CRA first -- because you typically have the most spares.  However if your character is newly created, you might only have 1-2 spares (5-10 pieces in your use tab); in this case, I would actually advise SKIPPING CRA during SSF, and instead make 19-21\\* CRA gear during 30% off. By then, you'll have 3 more weeks of clears under your belt. \\*\\*\\*\n\nConsider that a clean Arcane weapon is already nearly as strong as a 17\\* Abso wep. The fake Abso wep has 1 useful potential line; a real one would benefit by having 2. Not worth the star force or mesos for potential IMO.\n\nInstead, your goal is to hit 260 for the temp Arcane wep. Lvl 1 Origin, mastery and boosts are nice damage buffs. In those 60 days, join Hard Lucid/Will runs for usually 3 coins/run; you'll have a real Arcane wep which is worth investing into in approx 60 days.\n\n\\*The 30% IED set effect allows you to start recubing your WSE to exclude IED lines for many classes. In other words, the additional 15% IED allows you to safely obtain 30%BD/9-12% Att on your WSE.\n\n\\*\\*Many classes have specific tricks to take down Hellux. While you may not clear it now, I'm sure you'll be able to after SSF and after learning his mechanics.\n\n\\*\\*\\*This route gives you a chance to obtain CRA with better flames. 30% is a \"good\" event for items you don't need to safeguard aka many spares. Obviously, SSF is still better.",
            "> just go for the fake Arcane one, if I do that, I could focus my resources in star forcing other abso pieces like gloves and shoulder, a Dom Pendant if I\u2019m lucky, and permanent CRA gear.\n\nThe fake arcane is only 60 days, so do be aware of that. Personally I would focus on CRA (since it's cheap and long term), and then abso. You could aim to 18* a CRA wepaon and transfer it to a perm abso later (if the fake arcane lets you do HLomien you wouldn't need to waste cores).\n\n>Also, is it worth it to use Reinforced Gollux before getting to Superior?\n\nFor mains, you want to focus on Sup, so you could only ever use the 2 set reinforced, which likely isn't better than boss set. You could sf reinforced to transfer to sup if you have the mesos. I would stick with the boss set for now (can always transfer the PB belt to sup)",

            "Youtube has a lot of nice guides for new/returning players to check out. \n\n  \nVmatrix is where your 5th job nodes, skill nodes, boost nodes and special nodes are.   \nPlace a node on your vmatrix and you get either a new skill, boosted skill or a passive skill. \n\nNodes max at out at level 25. The more you enhance and level the node the more damage/numbers to up. Each class has their own recommended skill nodes to use that are helpful ie Holy symbol - gives exp buff.  etc   \nBoost nodes boost some of your previous job skills. Which skills you need to boost depends on your class so check out your class's discord to see which ones. Each skill that needs to be boosted can be boosted twice in a boost node. So if you have 3 skills that you need to boost, you're looking for a trinode that  has all 3 skills in it aka your perfect trinode. And you'd need to find 2 of them. \n\nWith boost nodes , the first skill listed is the one that matters when you place it in the vmatrix as you can't put another node in if it shares the first skill. example: skill A, skill B and skill C are the ones you need and you have 2 nodes. one that says Skill B, Skill A and Skill C. and another one that says Skill B, Skill C and Skill A. You wouldn't be able to put both in as they both start with Skill B.    \nSpecial nodes are temporary and do have timers on them. Any nodes you don't need or want can be dissembled into shards and you can make more random nodes or specify which type node to make(takes more shards than making random ones) \n\narcane force is just another level of power. It matters the most for mid game bossing as there might be arcane force requirements and for arcane river maps as you will be doing nerfed damage if you are not the minimum arcane force requirement. \n\n233 on a hyperburn, do your 7 clears of monster park dailies, do your arcane river dailies and weeklies.

The most useful ones are the summons, although there is some differences in the amount of damage they can do depending on class and it typically requires some funding in order for them to 1 shot.

            "If your willing to wait to hyperburn your chosen main then using terablink + hiperburn on the ab is the fastest way to get the exp tickets. You can use dreamcatcher to 220 or some of the exp vouchers (takes 4,0000)\nThe hyperburn tech mostly makes sense for people who already have an AB. If you don't mind taking a few days to do it, you can save the 4,000 vouchers and use the dreamcatcher runs on legion/links instead, then grind it manually to 220 which shouldn't take too long with the 3x coupons. ( If you don't have any mules to use dreamcatcher on, just use it on the ab though as you want to make sure to get the 3x per week once per Day)\n\n The 11,000 vouchers should get your hyperburn to around 233/236.  Which will unlock all the symbol dailies and weeklies to build up symbols quicker and get better daily exp. There's more than enough time to level to 260 even if you start late with the ab exp vouchers, daily exp, monster park, and event reward exp vouchers.\n\nIt also gives nodestones which you can disassemble then craft tradeable nodes to transfer over. Including the rewards from terablink I got 212 but it seems to be dependent on RNG.\n\nOtherwise I would just start a hyperburn you want to main, then use megaburninator on AB, use growth potions up to 200. Dreamcatcher to 220. That way you can keep the AB as a level 3 link mule and it contributes to legion levels. It will take a bit longer but you can still get the 11,000 exp vouchers and make the later levels a bit easier instead of getting a boost at first.\n\nMonster park is a big exp source.make sure to put the increased.monster park exp in temporary event stats, also it seems increased on sunny Sundays.\n\nOther than that just make sure your doing the daily/weekly party checkin.

You would HyperBurn the AB, collect the EXP rewards to transfer and then delete the hyperburned AB without claiming any post 200 HyperBurn rewards so you can HyperBurn a new class you actually want to main. HyperBurns from new creation have a level up event from 1-200 called Tera Blink which gives a few rewards.\n\nAngelic Buster is actually kind of strong so if you like the aesthetics of it, I would just play it. If you don't, I wouldn't recommend a new player to use the method you mentioned above because the remaster event gives a lot of untradeable rewards that would be useful for you to make an AB boss mule. AB is quite strong as a boss mule and getting a min lv210 AB for the link skill is a must for bossing so now's a great time to work on one on the side as you train your main Hyperburn and getting to 220 isn't very difficult even without a hyperburn on it for the 3x levels.

At the start best way is, Maple tour 2x per day, ursus 3x per day, Daily/weekly bossing. You'll want a good amount saved up every time an event rolls around  (Such as the upcoming SSF or MMT). This method is best for long term cost savings, but can be hard to do since the events aren't always frequent.\n\n3. If there is extra time afterwards, you check on each system to see how you are going to improve next  (Obtaining Gear and upgrading \\[Cubing, Starforce, Flames\\], Links/legion, nodes, hyper stats, inner ability, symbols, familiars, professions, eventually 6th job etc).  working on it holistically, improving one system up in small increments up to a certain point, then doing the next easiest improvement. \n\nIn the early game progression is relatively fast and there is an overload in stuff you can do, but it gets more straightforward. Do one step at a time, it can be fun to optimize but its also time consuming and easy to get burnt out that way. Take a break if you find your overwhelmed.\n\n If you need help I can try make a list of some of the things you can do post 200 based on priority, other than the events but that should get you started. its all about following those methods until eventually your at a point where you've reached a major progression goal.

Hyper Burning is the event thing that enables you to level up 3 levels until 260, probably what you are doing on your AB.",
            "There is a AB \"cheat sheet\" somewhere on this sub that goes through your main skill rotation.",
            "Most relevant boss prequests at this point wont take a significant amount of time. stuff like gollux, princess no should take around 10-15 minutes. Hard magnus might be the longest though since you have to do the heliseum questline. You don't need to do heroes of maple or black heaven for lotus/damien anymore. CRA is also five minutes or so. any of the others are usually just very short precursor quests.\n\nFor levelling, you can do either a passive or active method. IMO, its just better to do it passively, because  time spent grinding is better used on improving your character in other ways in the early stages.  Imo it makes more sense to grind when the easy exp rewards start to fall off and you can farm other resources while doing it (nodes, familiars, fragments etc). Ideally around the time you make meso/drop gear and unlock grandis. It gets slower the higher the level so if your doing it actively the key is really just to have consistent grinding sessions, maximizing kill rate and exp modifiers, without worrying to much about how fast the xp bar is going up. Otherwise its pretty easy with the passive method as long as you are consistent in logging in and getting things done, takes 1hr to do everything, 2 hours or so if you include bossing and other stuff.\n\nI would instead save dreamcatcher for mules because the exp starts to fall off past 215 ish, and is more beneficial to use for low levels to improve links/legion\n\na big boost would be to level up an AB on the side, to 220. You can use the megaburninator coupon on it, then growth pots/dream catcher up to 200. After that you can either use exp vouchers from weekly check in for less reward, or dreamcatcher, monster park, dailies just to get to 220. The Battle ground idol event gives 11,000 total exp vouchers which will probably bring you up to 235/240.  However if you decide to use exp vouchers it takes about 4,000 from the weekly checkin. You still get a profit of 7,000 vouchers that are transferable within account and get to keep the AB for the 210 link.\n\nGetting to 235 asap with this method will unlock the main arcane river dailies/weeklies and a higher monster park area which gives more exp overall, but otherwise if its too much effort than skip and follow below tips.\n\nif not doing that, Passive method, Just by doing arcane river dailies/weeklies (make sure to not skip the weekly entries by pressing no, each has 3x per week), monster park 7x per day it will give enough exp to level to 260 by the end of the event. Later on in the event, starting July 3rd there will be tomato festival which is a punch king style event which gives additional xp weekly.\n\nIn the event temporary stats, there is two skills. Increased monster park exp, and increased arcane daily xp, use your skill points on those. On sundays very important to do, not only is there further increased xp for monster park, but it also rewards exp coupon gift boxes. Monster park does take a bit longer around 30 minutes, if you have low damage, but the speed will improve over time.\n\nYou can gain around 30-50% ish per day depending on the level range which is a better reward to effort ratio then manual grinding at this point.\n\nActive method, basically just try to get as much damage in order to 1 shot, usually in the highest possible arcane river area you have available. This is done by working on all the systems, the biggest is to get your gear slots filled out and starter upgrades (epic potential 6%, 12 stars), your symbol levels will carry you eventually once you get 1.5x damage bonus, nodes are also important.\n\nHigh priority with legion/links and hyper stats is to get crit rate to 100%, then boost crit damage, followed by the damage links. (Use Zero to 100, megaburninator coupons, growth potions from daily checkin and maple world tour, and midnight dreamcatcher on mules)\n\n.For exp vouchers, from weekly check in, if your not doing the AB thing, then you can either use them on your main or mules. I would only use them on your main if you don't play super consistently and see yourself missing a lot of days during the event. Otherwise wait to click recieve on them and save for 200-210 on level 3 link skills\n\nAfter doing as much as you can improve for the day, you find a map that you can clear all the mobs on efficiently with a good rotation. Search up youtube for your class and the area to see example maps. Ideally you should look for channels with High burning, however as you get into the later areas this gets more rare to find, so just prioritize on optimizing kill rate and convenience . The battle analysis key lets you check kill  rate and exp gain to compare maps.\n\nAfter focusing on damage, EXP modifiers.",
            "Exp modifiers available\n\nBurning maps- This is the Bonus exp, up to 100% that shows up as a banner when you first enter a map, its dependent on how often a map is used, so less popular maps usually have higher burning. However many of the high burning maps have bad layouts which make it difficult to optimize kill rate. Ideally just do a compromise on both factors. \n\nEXP links (Evan,aran,mercedes), and legion (Zero)\n\nMVP, look out for it in the chat. Map wide 1.5x exp buff.

Major boss goal is to clear CRA to replace the temporary gear,  but also the early weekly bosses which some other gear comes from (Chaos pink bean, hard magnus, cygnus, czak etc).Beyond criticial rate and crit damage, boss damage/damage% IED is an important stat to improve for these bosses, atleast up to 85% which there are various sources for. The easiest source is to unlock your 2nd and 3rd familiar slots, and farm some common familiars. Reveal their potential to get 15% ied each.\n\nFor familiars you also want to get the increased item drop rate by small amount line, this speeds up obtaining equips and other resources. Additionally, you can reroll your inner ability for item drop rate, and pick up the Greed pendant from the monster park shop for 20% equipment drop rate.\n\nGear upgrading\n\nYoull get mystic cubes from doing bosses which you can cube all your items with. Use epic potential scrolls to skip from rare to epic,  the cubes have low tier up rate. You can get epic potential scrolls from event coin shop, or by doing yu garden daily quests. ( there are also a few rewarded from questlines) When cubing your looking for 6%-9% Main stat, on your weapon, emblem, and secondary your looking for %ATT/MATT (magic attack for mages, att for everything else). Dont buy bright or glowing cubes yet.\n\nStarforce everything first to 10 stars, push to 12 afterwards.\n\nFor flames, you can largely ignore the system for now, but youll just want to keep doing the daily bosses even if you already obtained an equip, such as the boss accessories, for a chance at it dropping higher flames. Using alchemy, you can fuse two duplicate equips together that rolled a bad flame to get an extra flame roll. Don't buy flames from the general shop, or claim Black rebirth flames from the event rewards yet.\n\nYou'll need meso income to upgrade your symbols, starforce gear, and some for cubing. Sell all your boss crystals and work towards higher tier bosses slowly.\n\nIf you can also do Maple tour 2x per day, and Ursus 3x per day (takes 10minutes). You can get 945m or so a week.",
