            "Hello, Whenthe :)\n\n\nIt\u2019s me again, with the announcement I promised. But first, let me give a brief preface on the state of the sub and some of my thoughts regarding the place.\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a hot minute since I last posted an announcement on here, hasn\u2019t it? Really, it\u2019s been a while since anything major has gone down.\n\n\nYes. I am wholeheartedly admitting that whenthe, like most other shitposting subs our size, has finally had the chance to take a breath of fresh air. It\u2019s no secret that the sub\u2019s been a little less active than usual, and to be honest, I don\u2019t mind that whatsoever. Let me explain.\n\n\nThe problem with irony is its finicky ability to evolve into an unironic mess of hysteria with the slightest provocation. We\u2019ve seen a lot of shit going on in the world lately, and it wouldn\u2019t be the first time something like that has briefly affected this sub. Left on their own, places like these will often times completely devolve into brain rot and incoherent babbling the likes of which could make even a redditor uncomfortable. On whenthe, we\u2019ve been lucky enough to have a relaxed community of people who aren\u2019t looking for excuses to decapitate each other over the slightest disagreement without any need for diversion, really. In doing so, we\u2019ve basically created an island of relative tranquility compared to the rest of the net.\n\n\n**Most content on the internet is rage bait or exposure farming.** I\u2019ll ask you to read that sentence again, no matter how familiar you may be with the thought. When provided with a system where mindlessness contributes more to gaining viewers\u2019 attention than a well thought out post, it\u2019s simply more profitable to encourage incoherent bullshit than it is to put care into online interactions. The internet has largely ignored this problem, and with each coming day it grows closer and closer to biting us in the ass big time.\n\n\nThat is why I sincerely believe there are only two types of communities where knowledgeable discussion can fully take place: the most scholarly of web forums, and relaxed shitposting hellscapes. Toxicity always overruns the other types in the end, and whereas profit incentive keeps the first category of internet communities in check, the second gives zero shits about profit and instead is fostered by actual human beings who want the place to stay enjoyable.\n\n\nThe place is a little more dead. So what? It\u2019ll be big again someday. Activity is a cycle, and typically subs go through periods of sedation anyways. And if it never does get as big as it once was? Who cares. We really do have a good thing going for us here (though I really don\u2019t believe inactivity is going to be the case at all.)\n\n\n**Do what you will here.** Keep the place chill. Bring the lore back, cook up some new insane genre of reaction image in the comments and spread it all over this digital hellscape, or literally just enjoy yourself. Whatever you use the sub as, it\u2019ll remain a good memory and a hub welcome to all, always. Just don\u2019t violate the site TOS. It\u2019s an online shitposting community, Socrates :P\n\n\n**Anyways, that\u2019s the bulk of the post. Here\u2019s the announcements. I\u2019ll keep them brief.**\n\n\n- Mod application assessments are now resumed. Wannabe powermods will be fed to the swamp goblins. Just be yourself. There\u2019s literally no required commitment anyways.\n\n- Stay away from active wars as the topics of memes. I applaud all of you for denying centrism, but let\u2019s be civil here, even if a post might turn into a massive circlejerk. War is genuinely miserable and not a thing I would wish upon anyone.\n\n- Start a trend or smth I\u2019m bored\n\n- Don\u2019t actually feel pressured to do the last thing.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it? That was the lost mod post? That was a bunch of pseudo-digital philosophical garbage and a check-in on the state of mod apps!\u201d\n\n\nYes, dear redditor. That\u2019s exactly what it is. \n\n\n**tl;dr Whenthe has fallen** (it hasn\u2019t in the slightest.), billions must go outside or something\n\n\nEdit: enabled non-lethal PvP under posts where it is explicitly allowed. Initial wave of nerfs will be patched in soon. Healer classes stay winning.",

I still remember when captions and watermarks turned hostile against each other, and battled each other during a gif of TF2 Engineer\u2019s trailer. That stuff ballooned into a whole story arc, and it was very enjoyable to witness. This is just one example that stuck with me. I like this community, and maybe someday I can post something here.\n\nBut for now, I will continue to lurk in the shadows\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5fhjiypzvn4d1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1ab5ec5eefa417a47c839590e16ee9bbea04830",

The shitposts are actually funny and levelheaded and the amount of effort each member of this sub puts into every post is just mindblowing to me. The okb franchise has fallen, but whenthe will stay for a long time. This sub is also a source for my general knowledge enhancement, I get my daily dose of current affairs through this sub and it has helped me answer better in many interviews of mine as I am about to enter undergrad uni.

Then they forgive those loans to turn it into social loan* What ELSE can they do other than forgive it or collect it? It just ends with \"China bad\" no matter what they do.\n\nAmerica can ban porn, everyone ignores it and says \"VPN exists, that law won't do anything\".
