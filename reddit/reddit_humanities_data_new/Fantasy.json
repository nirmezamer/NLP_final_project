Prizes will depend a bit on where you live, but I am willing to buy a few copies of queer spec fic books to ship, or to make some fun pride themed accessories (I knit, crochet, weave, sew, embroider, etc. and love making things). Final list of prizes to come.\n\nStay tuned for more posts, and let\u2019s make this Pride Month a celebration of diversity, inclusion, and the power of stories to bring us together.\n\nHappy Pride Month! \ud83c\udf89\n\nEDIT: Exciting things happening in the background! We have a new topic addressing intersectionality on June 20, and I've had a couple of people reach out to me to add to the prize pool! It'll probably take me a bit longer to sort out the giveaway now, but hey, we have a month! I'll make a comment with all the prizes and link it in this post when it's done!",

            "This looks great! I can't wait for all the great discussions (and losing control on my TBR pile!)",
            "Ahh, I've been so busy with, like, real life stuff but I'm so excited to see this wonderful slate of topics! Hopefully mid-next week I'll have time to reddit properly again in time for non-binary and trans and maybe I'll even have caught up with reading and be able to do the book discussion. Can't wait to go through the ones I've missed and once again expand the tbr!",
            "It took me a bit initially to find this post, as the posts in the series haven't been linking back to this index. I've been posting the index link for people in places, but a lot more would see it if the listed posts all had a link back.",
            "Dragon from the banner looks very cool. I'm looking forward to all the new book recs, thanks for organizing!",
            "I'm still learning to Reddit, even after how many years? So hopefully I can keep track of all this, but it looks like some interesting topics!",
            "Permission to cross post on r/QueerSFF  ?",
            "Thank you so much for doing this! I'm **so** excited for all of these discussions, but especially excited for the week 2 discussions! Shining a spot light on bisexual, NB, trans, and ace/aro characters is something I'm really looking forward to.",
            "Wow\u00a0\ud83e\udd79 This is so exciting. Thanks to all of the BB hosts for coming up with this great slate, and thanks to the mods for supporting it. I am really looking forward to the discussions, which all look fabulous and are so thoughtful too. I'm heading to my drafts to start putting together recs!\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAs a queer person this makes me feel so welcome and supported here on r/fantasy\u00a0\ud83e\udd79 This is my favorite community and it means a lot to me.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThank you \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9c\ud83e\udd0e\ud83d\udda4",

            "Super exciting! Thank you very much for organizing this! <3",
            "Ooh looking forward to this. What stands out are the Horror with heart so I can plan my Sapphic horror month for October like I did last year. Also the Ace/Aero discussion is always a treat to see.",
            "I hope to do a Pride specific related post every day this month. I probably won't succeed but it won't be for lack of trying.",
            "This looks really cool, definitely looking forward to what people come up with in week 3!\n\nI know I'm going to not have access to my laptop on the 14th (or WiFi, but mobile data exists), so I'm thinking I should probably prepare something for ace/aro recommendations. Any hints for format? \n\nIf you do make stuff, I'd definitely love to see pictures (I knit and cross stitch, and am currently learning to spin (2nd attempt at making a skein went much better than 1st!)). And speaking of, the short story author K.A. Cook has a lot of basic little [pride cross stitch patterns](https://aroworlds.com/pride-patch-tutorials/patch-pattern-gallery/) for anyone interested. Very beginner friendly and there are tutorials on the website too.",
            "I've been doing all-queer spec fic Bingo Cards for going on five years now and I'm excited to do some recommending.",
            "This is the absolute best surprise! I can\u2019t wait for some of these discussions. Really appreciate that this is probably quite a bit of effort for the BB team \u2764\ufe0f.\n\n(Petition to make that the permanent banner here pls)",
            "I\u2019m excited to see what will be discussed and hopefully find some new books to check out. Love the banner, btw.",
            "I'm beyond stoked for these topics! I do wish that there was at least one focused on BIPOC queer authors, readers and narratives. But I look forward to seeing everyone include those into each of the topics.",
            "this sounds awesome!! can\u2019t wait to get more book recs!",
            "Excited for this, I\u2019m really looking forward to discover new authors and stories involving queer people",
            "What is BB Bookclub?\n\n(Please tell me it stands for Bisexual Blast, the new Slurpee flavour at 7-Eleven)",
            "What a great incentive, thanks for organising this! Looks like it'll be an exciting month for the sub, yay!!",
            "This is awesome!  Great idea.  I'm looking forward to some good recs to add to the endless tbr \n\n\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9c\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\u26a7\ufe0f\n\n\nHappy pride month to all the lgbtq+ friends out there.",

            "Nice ! Happy pride everyone ! I'm trying to only read LGBTQIA+ books this month but I'm kind of in a reading slump tbh",
            "Oh, this is exciting. Looking forward to the discussions and book recs!",
            "Oh this looks awesome! It's been such a joy to watch queer specfic sort of explode over the last ~10 years. Of course there was some before that but these days it feels like a veritable buffet of excellent books. My TBR list is 100+ books long and like 75% of those are some flavor of queer. Excited to dive into these threads over the last month and make my list even longer!",
            "i'm so excited!",
            "Ooo so many fun topics!",
            "so good. happy pride month!",
            "This sounds like so much fun!",
            "This sounds great! I have lots of queer indie book reccs to share, and I'm always looking for more.",
            "Looking forward to these posts! I\u2019m aiming to read queer books all month so it would be great to get some extra recs!",

            "Yeah that dragon is so cool!! I love it. I don't know who made it but the mods were gracious enough to let me use the banner image.",
            "Yes please! Share away :)",
            "Yeah me too! I have a couple of authors in mind for that one but I'm hoping there's a few people here who can share stories of the 80s and 90s (or earlier) and which authors were making their mark. It was hard sorting all the topics into weeks since I want to discuss them all today! But this is better; gives us all some time to think about things and make great recommendation lists.",
            "That is a great theme! I've been exposed to so much more excellent horror in the last year. I was playing around with doing a bingo card just for horror but I'm not ready to read that much yet. I do hope you post about your reading in October then! I'll be looking forward to it. (And if you didn't join us in the BB Bookclub last October then you need to read The Spirit Bares its Teeth by Andrew Joseph White)!",

            "That was my original goal too, but it is a lot of work!! If you manage it I'll be very impressed. And really happy. :) so many good book recommendations in your thread today already.",
            "Are you on Ravelry? If so, let's be friends! \n\nRight now for the format I have a list of recommended books and some discussion questions. Anything you'd like to contribute to the topic is welcome! \n\nAh those cross stitch patterns are great. :) I've also found a few really fun accessories to make (hats, mitts) that aren't overtly rainbow but still colorful that I'd love to share. \n\nI'm currently growing flax in my garden to hopefully spin into yarn later. It's a completely different kind of spinning, but if they Egyptians could hand spin it I'm willing to learn.",
            "I want you to know that I LOVE your bingo cards! I'm not sure if I've ever commented on your posts or bingo reviews, but I always upvote them and think it's awesome you've done so many years in a row of queer SFF bingo cards.",
            "Yeah I had topics for every day of the month, but we decided that that was just too much work. So, instead, I have put a  lot of bipoc recommendations strewn throughout all of the other various topics. There's not a specifically dedicated post, but I also didn't want to neglect other forms of diversity. \n\nYou are also welcome to make your own thread (or push /u/ct_phipps to make such a post on one of his planned daily pride posts)!",
            "Even if xenizondich23, eregis, and tiniestspoon don't feel up for it, I'm sure someone can make a post about BIPOC queer rep on one of the days nothing is planned for this.",
            "Haha, that's a great name! But it's not just for bisexuals. It stands for Beyond Binaries. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1c4r5dg/bb_bookclub_our_june_read_is_dionysus_in/) is our announcement for the June reading! Find a copy of the book and read along with us! We'd love to have you. You can always find the /r/fantasy book club links, upcoming book announcements, and any other information at the top most stickied thread in the subreddit (the Monthly Book Club Hub one).",
            "> some good recs to add to the endless tbr\n\nI have a lot! Too many, to be honest. A lot of the lists I've made have more well-known books (Left Hand of Darkness, Locked Tomb, The Starless Sea, just to name a few) but I also have a lot of more obscure ones! So I hope there's something in there for you as well :)",
            "Aww yeah! I won't be the only one recommending things! I hope to find a few new reads that I have yet to encounter as well. This bodes well.",

            "Thank you very much!\n\nEdit:\n\nOops, its against the rules to do so many planned posts. I will probably do some consolidated posts instead. Still, I am so excited to participate in all of these above!",
            "I AM on ravelry. Username same as here (I am useless at usernames). I don't have any friends on ravelry currently, and mostly use it to keep track of my stash/needles/projects (so many people want to know how long things took to knit! Can just look it up). I'm currently knitting a blanket just from stitch patterns, so not much interesting updates either.\n\nCool. If I'm organised, I will prepare something in a simple format, and be ready to respond to things.\n\nGrowing your own flax to spin is next level stuff! I won't say it hasn't crossed my mind to aquire an angora when I can finally have rabbits (I reject the dog/cat binary, rabbits forever), but that's not happening in the near future.",

            "This is a good point. u/xenizondich23, would it be possible for ether me or beldaran1224 to make a guest post about BIPOC queer representation (or maybe intersectional queer representation if we want to be more broad and include things like disability neurodiversity, class, etc.) and have that added to the schedule in the post/be part of the series? I understand if not, I don't want to step on your toes, but I think this would be a really important topic to discuss explicitly and really focus on instead of just mentioning it as more of a sidenote in other discussions.\n\n~~Also, are you going to be using this post as a table of contents/directory/list of links so that people can easily find previous days' posts once they're up? Because that might be particularly helpful if posts get downvoted off the main page quickly. (If you don't want to do it, I can try to make a comment that contains the list of links as well.)~~\n\nEdit just realized that the post says all following posts will be linked back.",

            "Hi, I have a different Pride post question I wanted to ask you, but couldn't PM you - would you mind PMing me instead so I can respond to it? If not I totally understand and can just ask here instead."

            "There's a wholesome answer that every series has its audience.\n\nBut you should skip Swrd of Truth. Terry Goodkind doesn't deserve to steal anyone else's time",
            "Name of the wind. \nThe book is fantastic, and the second is great but nearly 20 years later there's no realistic hope of the third book. So the series is dead.",
            "Ready Player 2",
            "The Demon Cycle series by Peter V Brett. \n\nFantastic initial concept, with some great action at times, completely mired by a lot of incredibly troubling content and themes. \n\nThere isn't a single major female character that isn't sexually abused in one way or another. They're nearly all entirely defined by their sexual needs and desires and motivated by their rapes and abuse.\n\nThere's a really problematic Arabic inspired society. It is very caricaturish and features a lot of rape, particularly of little boys. \n\nEven outside of these issues, the series gets consistently worse as it goes on. \n\nIt sets up like it's going to be action packed, but becomes more chqracter driven. Which wouldn't be so bad if the characters were well written and defined. There's constant, baffling directions some of the characters take like the main character Arlen deciding to speak in a heavily accented dialect from book 3 onwards. \n\nThe flashbacks of books 2, 3 and 4 all tell the same story from different perspectives, with very little to no added interesting moments or details. \n\nThe final book and sequence felt like the author didn't really know how to end the series. It was like a poorly thought out video game sequence, with different levels and every new chapter had a new baddy to defeat with a new technique.",
            "Be wary of r/fantasy recs as well. People here tend to recommend a lot of more niche fantasy and character driven prose heavy reads, which are definitely very good but at the end of the day you should make the decision yourself based on whether a book seems interesting to you.\n\nThat being said please avoid Fourth Wing it is just pure garbage. It\u2019s not even entertaining garbage, or even guilty pleasure garbage. It\u2019s just bad in every aspect from beginning to end",
            "I usually have positive things to say about the Mage Errant series, but you'd probably hate the MC, even though he gets better after the first book - social anxiety, and also childhood trauma. Strong willpower though, and he overcomes a lot with the help of true friends, but it's particularly bad in the first book (also for reasons I can't reveal due to spoilers).   \nIt's a shame, but if you hate existing in such a character's headspace, it would ruin it for you.\n\nAs for me, I hate all the tropes that have to do with unnecessary lewdness and insertion of sex into the narrative and dynamics. I'm not against romance, but everything that has to do with an author's fetishes grosses me out immediately - you can usually tell because the energy and quality shifts into what you'd expect from porn (and that's basically what's happening: the author was just horny).",

Also, if you are a romance person, stay as far away from *Winter's Orbit* as you can. The entire thing is based on crippling insecurity (and MY personal least favorite trope - see below).\n\n\nNow for some self-indulging.\n\nLeast favorite trope: poor communication. If your story only works because character A fails to communicate correctly/at all with character B, your story SUCKS. Get a better story.\n\n\nAnd because I too originally only read the title, and felt the need to vent, here is some bonus hate-content of series people should actually avoid:\n\n*The Second Apocalypse* series by Scott Bakker. Self-important edgelord misogyny masquerading as Deep Philosophy (tm), with the most unsatisfying \"fuck y'all\" ending of all time. I'm honestly upset at how disappointed the whole thing became over time, considering how masterfully written the early books were. But in the end, it just never amounts to anything past poser nihilism. There's a reason his publisher didn't want to touch any more books by him after the ending of *The Aspect Emperor* series, and it's not cause they weren't smart enough to appreciate his genius.\n\n*The Name of the Wind*. Also misogynistic (ask Marrie Brennan if you don't believe me: https://www.swantower.com/2015/02/04/the-absence-of-women/), but more than that - I'm sick of it being the gateway to fantasy for so many people who then get jaded about \"fantasy authors never finishing series\" as if Rothfuss isn't the outlieriest of outliers. That book had its time, and the series - its chance. Let's find new gateways into the genre and stop recommending this.",
            "For angsty and/or self-doubting, you will probably want to skip most of Robin Hobb.\n\nR. F. Kuang does not reduce the angsty characterization for *Babel*, so it's not going to float your boat either.\n\n  \nIf you are into SciFi, definitely give the Nick Seafort saga a pass.

I've read 8 of the 10 books and it is possibly my favourite series ever, but while I did like the first trilogy a lot, I didn't enjoy it anywhere near as much as the first standalone or the 2nd trilogy, which may be my fault for accidentally reading the series out of order but I don't think it matters much.

It takes some broad liberties with Tolkien's story with some serial numbers and plotlines changed, and imagines if the grand hero (who in the case slayed the evil lord instead of throwing a ring in a volcano) returns back to the elflands.  He struggles with the trauma of his experience, with whether his family will only see him as the dealer of death he became, and with finding a love of music again.  \n\nIt was really, really good if you don't mind stories that are more driven by character than plot",

            "I don't think I'd call Gods of the Wyrdwood medieval *or* European.  I've seen someone else suggest that the \"clanless\" are suggestive of the Indian Dalits.  On top of that, the way that gender and family structures are understood is entirely different.  The important people in society seem to practice polygamy, taking multiple wives and husbands, and most families expect to have one child who is a trion (a non-binary person).  Lastly, the description of the wood and Ranya's web seem to draw from non-European influences.\n\nTechnologically, it's all over the place as well.  The villagers are wielding spears and longbows, but because of the ecology there are airships, which is more Victorian/WWI.  Then there are the \"Blooming Rooms\" whose description suggested something similar to the gas chambers of WWII but with plants and Cahan's description of how the Cowl works, which suggested that he had some understanding of chemistry/physics.\n\nIt's a great book, but it's probably not what OP is looking for.\n\nAs an aside, one reason I'm dating this later might be that Cahan's character reminded me of Rin from The Poppy War in terms of his upbringing, his struggles with the Cowl, and the contempt he shows for some of the other characters.  I think I've subconsciously decided that the two are set in roughly contemporaneous societies, even though the two are very different.",
