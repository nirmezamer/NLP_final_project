            ">clearly stating for years that SMTP is unaffected\n\nHow's that working out?  Seen the latest update?  SMTP will be affected as well.\n\nAfter selling companies on subscriptionifying and cloudifying everything because \"it can do all the same things, and works with everything just the same, and no maintenance!\" - they are gradually going through and sabotaging all use cases (by normal SMBs with sysadmins of ordinary skill for those size orgs, not necessarily enterprises) that use Exchange Online for anything other than basic \"person sitting at a desk sending emails one at a time\" scenarios.\n\nNeed to send large volume external emails?  That's a new SKU in Azure!  Also retrain your staff if classic Outlook ever goes away, since mail merge doesn't exist in the \"new Outlook\" which is glorified OWA.\n\nNeed to send from third party appliances or software that still meet all your business needs and are a paid-for investment?  Better replace them with new ones just to implement what merely two companies (Microsoft and Google) decided is a universal industry standard everyone needs to implement to send email (OAuth2).  I get that they are the giants, and have a ***part*** in writing standards, but it should not be unilateral.  At least if they'd made a proposal to IETF to amend the SMTP spec to define a complete implementation of an SMTP client to include OAuth, and it was accepted, there would be more leverage to force vendors of still-in-support products to implement it instead of saying \"Microsoft and Google decided they don't support standard authenticated SMTP anymore, go subscribe to something else\".  There also would have been opportunities for the rest of the industry to propose alternative ways of modernizing and ensuring backward compatibility.\n\nHave a third party phishing filter you trust more than Microsoft's to catch everything with fewer false positives?  ***You can't turn off EOP*** for your own email tenant, and they are actively sabotaging your exclusion rules in recent years, you can't bypass what they think is \"high confidence phishing\" (which usually includes legitimate invoices from small companies) except in one convoluted and new way that is only documented in the context of setting up phishing simulations.\n\nNeed to run a simple eDiscovery search in less than an hour?

        "content": "Hello everyone!   \nMaking this post to hopefully help those in need it with this problem in the future.  \n  \nI currently work for an IT MSP, and recently ran into a client who had issues not being able to open Office 365 desktop apps. They would either crash or just not open at all. After trying to reinstall, I ran into an error where it would not let me reinstall at all.  Error Code: 30175-45 (8).  I tried everything. Most recommendations was to install Office through offline packages and PowerShell. Did not work either with same error code being thrown.  \n\n\n**HERE IS THE FIX:**  \n  \nOffice would not reinstall, because there were corrupted files / registry keys getting in the way. So,  \n- Use Revo Uninstall to uninstall Office, but make sure you choose Advanced Clean. And get rid of ALL the registry keys and files associated with Office. ALL of them. Then restart PC.  \n- Once back in, download SARA (Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant) and select Office, and \"having trouble uninstalling Office\"  \n- Once that is finished, restart PC again, and install Office via OfficeSetup.exe   \n\n\nAfter manyyy hours, this fix finally worked. I quite literally tried everything else before this. ",

            "just the sara is usually good enough in this case, happens when users power off a machine/crash it during a c2r office update usually",
            "No using SARA to try and fix it would tell me \u201cuser doesn\u2019t have active license\u201d , even though we can verify license through admin portal.. believe me this was the only fix"
