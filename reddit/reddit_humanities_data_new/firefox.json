Of course if you shelled out a few grand for a screen with complete overkill refresh rate, you're going to want to see a difference. Me, I can see a difference between 60 and 100 Hz. Beyond that I maybe notice a little additional sharpness at 144 but that's it. So 155, for a browser?

But Firefox (sadly), isn't really a mainstream browser any more, is it? Google's IMO ever more dreadful Chrome and it's perhaps somewhat less dreadful clones (at least until MV3 potentially ruins all of them), have largely steamrollered Firefox. Mozilla really should have found a way to fight back aggressively/keep a lot more market share, if there was one. \n\nLike, say, desktop Linux, which probably could have really taken on Windows if only average users were more flexible/willing to learn a bit, Firefox is more a religion for it's fanbase, now, isn't it? So people need to have faith and patience, ignore/work around the downsides, don't switch to Chromium browsers even if you are tempted.
