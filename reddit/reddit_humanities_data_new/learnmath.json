            "Starting with the obvious ones:\n\n1. Khan Academy\n2. Wolfram Alpha\n3. 3Blue1Brown\n\nThe less obvious to the mainstream, but perhaps obvious to normal self learners:\n\n1. [Brilliant.org](https://Brilliant.org)\n2. Crash Course Algebra\n\nThe not very well known outside of certain circles ones:\n\n1. FreeCodeCamp (If you look through they have a lot of math courses. Most are 12-14 long video's that deep dive one thing. \n\nMy personal favorite learning flow:\n\n1. Use Khan Academy as the main source of knowledge. This is the one you go from Algebra --> Calculus on and the one that you focus on complete mastery. \n2. Use [Brilliant.org](https://Brilliant.org) as your first step in any new terrain and also your way of cultivating a better way of thinking about math. \n   1. How to use Khan and Brilliant together? I personally suggest looking at khan first if you're new to math-- but instead of actually solving problems or watching video's just look at what topics there are and see what you're going to be doing next. For example, you might peruse khan academy and decide to start on Algebra 1. After that, switch over to [brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org) and do two things: \n      1. Go through the 'core' mathematical thinking courses. I'm talking the logic, problem solving, mathematical fundamentals, algebra fundamentals, geometry fundamentals, etc. \n      2. Look at which Brilliant course corresponds to the next piece you're going to do on Khan Academy. If that's algebra I, then you should observe that there is also an algebra 1 course on brilliant. Open that course up on brilliant, and check the pre-requisites. In this case it states that you should already have algebra fundamentals, so if you did those earlier-- you should be good to jump in. However, if you chose to start on Algebra 2 or Geometry on Khan Academy, you might open up some different pre-requisites and notice you haven't done them. At this point it's up to you if you want to do them on [Brilliant.org](https://Brilliant.org) if you've already learned those basic concepts in school or if you'd rather still do them. For me, I suggest doing them anyways. I took Algebra 1, Geometry and Algebra 2 in high school, but instead of going right to Trigonometry or Pre-Calculus I started with pre-algebra on brilliant and I do not regret it. There were some things I knew, yes, but I went through them quickly since unlike Khan Academy brilliant doesn't require 'mastery' but rather lets you self pace. So just solving the problems doesn't take very long if you truly know it-- then when you come across something you missed, forgot or simply never learned-- you'll have a chance to fill in the gaps. Additionally, [brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org) often teaches you things that your school didn't teach you (perhaps because its' too difficult for children, but technically \\*should\\* fit in with that course), so it's often worth at least skimming through courses you think you already know the content of. \n3. Use Wolfram Alpha only when you have tried to solve a problem multiple times, but are unable to do so-- or if you got marked wrong and didn't find the help on khan/brilliant very helpful and want a second look at the step by step process. Sometimes a different perspective helps a lot. \n4. 3Blue1Brown\n   1. For this channel, I suggest just watching whatever happens to interest you. Once you get through the advanced maths though it's probably good to go through his calculus, linear algebra and differential equations series because he's more likely than not going to give you a new/fresh perspective on something. \n5. Crash Course Algebra\n   1. This one isn't really necessary, but I did watch through the series on x2 speed before starting my [brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/khan) / khan academy journey and I don't regret it. It was a good refresher and got me thinking about math in simple easy way. (I could watch it while half asleep in the morning, or late at night when I was getting tired, or I could watch it before work, etc. It doesn't require a lot of time per episode so it's not a bad thing to just casually go through. I even watched it while eating lunch a few times.)\n6. Free Code Camp\n   1. For this one, i'd say it's best if you already have a pretty strong idea of your math level, or if you want to review something you learned many years ago but don't want to spend a lot of time doing it. A normal Khan Academy course could take a pretty long amount of time, but if you have a free weekend you can plow through the entirety of a course using the Free Code Camp Youtube Math Video's.",

        "content": "So, I am an A-Level student (so \\~grade 12 I believe?) and looking to study some more math in my free time.\n\nThese are the reasons why:\n\n1. I'm doing an internship with 2-3 other students under a math professor mid August. The other students are definitely very proficient in the sense that they have great logical thinking, problem solving skills and a decent amount of experience. I would like to develop these skills like they have so I can keep up, and really engage with whatever is given to me. I want to feel confident facing new problems.\n\n2. I'm not looking to directly improve my grades, since I can just study the actual content if I wanted that, but being able to have a better general understanding of the content in lessons would help a lot. Being able to solidify my skills so I can have a better shot at exam questions would be benefit.\n\n3. I want to have some fun! I enjoy puzzles and anything that gives my brain a bit of an exercise. I feel spending some time looking into some new areas of math I may have not seen before would be a great way to spend some of my spare time. \n\nThings I'm currently interested in exploring more are real and complex analysis, differential calculus, number theory, and discrete math. I did a presentation on game theory a few months ago and loved the whole project, and I'm also writing a short paper on complex geometry for another extra-curricular project. \n\nAdditionally, anything to do with coding applications! I want to test my python + logic, and it's something I've felt like getting into for a while now. [https://youtu.be/QNFQvX-MQgI?si=-GJ6Fp0XuinQ4bUK](https://youtu.be/QNFQvX-MQgI?si=-GJ6Fp0XuinQ4bUK) - this video definitely helped the urge.\n\nIf there are any textbooks or online resources you think help my situation, are not too difficult to jump into, and have appropriately challenging exercise questions, let me know! :) I was recently given brilliant for free off a friend, so I'll be using that to my advantage too.",

            "If you like to mix coding and more advanced mathematics, and are up for a challenge, [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) may be right up your alley. They have a huge pool of very carfully created puzzles, a reasonable difficulty rating, and the best part -- it's free. Should be a very good (and fun) way to brush up problem solving skills!\n\nAdditionally, you may use *any* programming language you want.",

        "content": "I am still trying to wrap my head around Calculus. I need to know what is it exactly and why it is.\n\n1. If i understand it correctly, the whole point of calculus is, that the change of some function can be described by some other function called its derivative.\n2. Then they said calculus is about instantaneous rate of change. But what it tells me, if i know that at some point the rate of change is 0.8? Moreover calculus works with infinitesimal small change on domain x, but for humans is more natural if they know how y changed regarding to x in unit scale eg from x=1 to x=2 but instant rate of change is like from x=0.0000001 to x=0.0000002.\n\nSo again, what the some \"random number\" rate of change value tells me then.\n\n3.  Is it really needed? There is a story calculus was invented by Newton when he made some laws of motion, that speed is one variable and acceleration (its derivation) is another, but I can compute the rate of change the acceleration myself just by computing change of y to change of x, so why need the calculus and derivates?\n\nI understand that when derivate exists as some math object like function it can be plotted or put in the equation, but other than that what is the need for it.\n\nWhy you need the derivative and calculus.",

            "The change in y over the change in x will give you an average rate of change(calculus textbooks might also refer to this as a secant line). Calculus takes this average rate of change and makes the time we are averaging over smaller and smaller, approaching 0. This gives us an instantaneous rate of change, which we call the derivative.\n\nTo put things a little more physically, let\u2019s consider driving cars. calculus lets us find our exact speed at any given moment(instantaneous rate of change). Comparing the change in y over the change in x gives us an average speed over some time frame(average rate of change), which isn\u2019t as useful. If you only know the average speed you can\u2019t tell me what my speed was at some particular point in time.\n\nHopefully this helps at least a little bit, let me know if you have any questions!",
            "In simple terms, derivatives tell you the slope of a function (remember, slope = rate of change). Some functions have a very obvious slope, like y = 2x + 3 has a slope of 2 throughout the whole function. And indeed, if we calculus its derivative, we get y' = 2. However, some functions, like y = x^(2) change their slope at every point. While we can look at a graph of y = x^(2) and make intuitive judgements on its slope (e.g. the slope at x=0 is 0 since that's when the function appears \"horizontal\"), it's really difficult to precisely explain why. This is where calculus comes in! Calculus was born out of a few decades of attempting to formalize this idea. If you look at the definition of a derivative, it's simply the limit as the slope between two points, as two points get closer and closer together (i.e. the slope at an instant, or the \"instant rate of change\").\n\nAs for why this is useful, well just think of all the curves in nature that you can now describe their slopes! Most things aren't flat, so we now have a formal way to describe their \"rate of change\" when they're not flat. A common example of this is a car's speedometer. How do you know how fast you're going if your car is never going at the exact same speed consistently? You use derivatives\\*! How do you know the rate your speed is changing, i.e. your acceleration? You look at the derivative of your speed! Don't even get me started on all the complexities of fluids and how you need derivatives to be able to understand anything about them!\n\n\\*well, actually your car basically just looks at slopes of secant lines since it doesn't know what a derivative is, but we'll ignore that.",
            "I would start with differntiating from 1st priciples.",
            "The notion of the derivative is really only the beginning of calculus. Informally, when we watching something like a ball roll down a hill, we have this sort of intuitive understanding that at every instant, there's some quality to its movement that we understand as a velocity. It's different than the average velocity which is calculated by the change in position over corresponding time. There's an instantaneous velocity as well. Derivatives were defined and formalized to describe stuff like that first.\n\nBut after you learn how to calculate derivatives, there's usually an entire chapter or two dedicated to applications of the derivative. Once we can use a nice function to model the behavior of something that is changing, calculus can help us analyze it in all sorts of ways. Once of those things is to find the maximum and minimum values of the function. You can imagine this being helpful in business when the function is modeling something like revenue.\n\nBut that's really only the beginning of the story. There's a counterpart to the derivative which is called the integral. It's defined in a completely different way than the derivative and it has all sorts of other applications. In fact, I'd probably argue that integrals have even more applications than derivatives. But what is really surprising to most people is that the derivative turns out have a fundamental connection to the integral. In fact, derivatives can make it significantly easier to calculate integrals. This relationship is called the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and it's usually introduced towards the end of Calc 1. \n\nAnd then in calc 2, there is a third concept called Taylor Series which find yet another neat application for derivatives.",
            "it is to calculate the rate of change of the rate of change.  if you had a graph showing something accelerating, if the line was straight then easy.\n\nif it was a curve (indicating that the acceleration was changing rate), then you need to work with derivation.",
            "ok and regarding slope do you have in your head some mapping of slope to angle or what does some arbitrary slope number tells you? if i say slope 0.7 you see the angle or?\n\ni understand if the ROC is eg 2, i know that y changes twice as fast as x, but the question above?",
            "0.7 slope means it has the same slope as y = 0.7x, so a bit slower than y = x. This is the main idea behind tangent lines, they help show you visually what that slope actually looks like on a flat line.",
            "You don't usually need to convert slope to angle. Slope is understandable and useful enough on its own. Points with zero slope are very useful: they are often points where the function reaches a maximum or a minimum. Just looking at finite changes won't tell us where exactly those points are: a derivative function allows us to calculate them exactly."
