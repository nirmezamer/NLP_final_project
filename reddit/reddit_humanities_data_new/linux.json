I did come across hiccups along the way, especially due to being on Arch since it's a rolling release but I have never felt that I needed to switch and stay on X11 for multiple years.\n\nI would describe moving to wayland similar from moving from Windows to Linux in the sense of needing to find alternatives.",

It's a small thing with the cursor rendering, but it basically bricks the entire usecase in the process.\n\nThe same thing goes for so many other apps and usecases. It works for most of it and then you hit a giant brick wall over the most stupid and minute issue, but there is no solution or fix. All you can do is wait, report and hope it'll get fixed eventually only for something else to come along later.\n\nThat's normal for software to mature over time and the complex ecosystem we have trying to get it to work within old and new and various hacks. The problem is, it was presented as solution to all this tech debt. It was praised to finally standardize and make all that simpler and more compatible and yet it only manages to achieve that in a broader sense with the edge cases still existing. Not entirely its fault of course, but rectifying all that small fry is gonna turn it into bloat unless the broken apps sign on to fix their ends instead.\n\nAll that involves even more work and justifiably people are getting concerned that after all the work that has already gone into Wayland it's still not there. The simple nature thus contradicted by the mountain of work still ahead of it. So the discussing moves towards whether it has a fundamental flaw causing all this extra work to materialize when the idea was to keep it simple. People rightfully suspect a wrong turn was made somewhere and that being the reason for ever more delays and development limbo.\n\nWhat's needed is a critical look, especially after all these years. An audit if you will. To actually see if there is a wrong turn somewhere or what can be done to lift some parts up and reduce the development burden as a result. Problem is, that is even more work and needs outside help of folks not deep within the project already completely code blind to see errors.

There's Linux and some rounding errors.\n\nI can tell you as a fact that Wayland had exactly zero impact on me as a software developer and I work on desktop applications daily.

Setting up polygons in 3D with windows mapped onto them is viable, but getting input into them without making them synthetic leads one back to some idea around manipulating a hidden stack of windows at (0, 0) on some \"real\" X screen so that you can put in the (x, y) co\u00f6rdinates in that hidden screen's frame of reference since you can't do directly at the window's because the X call for it just...doesn't...exist.

Sure, \"protocol\" in theory was supposed to help some, but we've still ended up with problems that individual compositors are to blame for.\n\nNot to beat a dead horse, but there have been many X servers available over the years. My software written for X11 works the same on ANY X11 server, whether it's one of many proprietary servers, XFree86, X.Org, XNest, among many others. There are caveats with this, but as a general rule the X Protocol enforces compatability between implementations. Wayland protocol, does not seem to have this same effect, whatever the reason may be. Thus, we end up with individual implementations that either don't implement a protocol, or implement it poorly or slightly differently, and suddenly it's not Wayland's fault (which it's not usually) but rather one of any implementation's fault.\n\nSure, things are getting better, but the flaw of lack of universality that Wayland has will always be a problem everytime something changes in a protocol, backend, etc.\n\nPerhaps, the only answer to this is just more time for everyone to catch up.\n\nI keep trying Wayland, and it's usually better each time, but it still can't replace X for me unless I want to live with various quirks (and I don't).",

I am trying to explain why there are performance issues with Wayland on some systems.\n\n> basic things that X11 can (e.g. remembering window position).\n\nThe caveat is that X11 made a tradeoff: it traded absolute positioning with gutted modern display support in general.

Removed all cables except power and did prep work.\n\nUnplugged one power cable, plugged it in to the UPS.  Unplugged the other, plugged that in to a separate UPS.

Anyway, robustness and reliability over the years has generally got worse and worse over time due to many different factors. \n\nFirst: To increase the performance of integrated circuits (processors), they had to get smaller. That generates more heat in a smaller space and causes more heat stress, not only to the processor, but the board the processor is attached and any other nearby components. Boot up, shut down, and reboots are more damaging than they use to be due to simple physics of thermodynamics. Parts get hotter faster, and high quality cooling causes them to cool faster as well which is just as destructive. \n\nSecond: To increase the performance of electronic systems, the busses had to be shortened which puts the already high heat producing components in a smaller space and that causes more heat stress during boot ups, shutdowns, and reboots. \n\nThird, the components had to be engineered in a way that they could handle higher voltages which yet again makes the problem with heat even worse.\n\nForth, changing environmental regulations, well intentioned as they may be, has fucked build quality time and time again as the years go on. This doesn't just effect electronics, this effects everything that has some type of solder joint. This has fucked up god knows how many products from home appliances like washers/dryers and refrigerators to residential/commercial/industrial HVAC and refrigerator systems to video game consoles to enterprise servers. \n\nFifth: Metal availability effects build quality substantially. Copper use to be cheap and abundant, so they didn't hold back. In the 90s and 2000s, manufacturers overbuilt a lot of motors, transformers, and wiring to carry power from one component to another. But in the last 10-15 years, copper has become more and more expensive and is now the most expensive it has ever been even adjusted for inflation and there are major supply problems. Some of it is due to logistic meltdowns during covid, but much of it is a simply byproduct of waste. Manufacturers rarely bother to consider long term resource management. We live in a world of quarterly metrics, and undercutting competitors by pennies every where they can. If they can save 10 cents by using slightly less copper in the windings of a psu transformer, they will, especially if they are having a copper shortage and need to stretch out the supply to have enough to finish fabrication of the products they are on contract to produce. Then, to make matters worse, we have all this new green tech coming out: EVs, solar energy, and all the infrastructure needed to support it. During covid and after, I started seeing a massive failure rate of just about everything made in China that had electrical windings: PSUs, server fans, wiring harnesses, ect.    \n\nThere are other factors as well, but I think anybody who bothered to read what I have already wrote gets the point I'm making. I'm an old fart that has watched the evolution of electronics for almost 4 decades. The quality is not a linear curve going down. There are an unfathomable number of factors that cause quality to go up and down, but over time there has been a huge drop overall.",
