            "As a player of both, I say both are difficult in their own ways and aren't comparable due to how differently their respective games work\n\n\nGeometry dash banks hard into tight timings, memorization, and generally very unforgiving gameplay, but the levels usually only last a few seconds to a few minutes in terms of how much gameplay\n\nJuke's towers of hell is a lot more reliant on special strategies for specific jumps, endurance, and much longer length (anywhere from a few minutes to hours to complete towers); but towers are generally more forgiving since you can catch yourself on lower floors if you fall",
            "As someone who thinks that Tidal wave is in the top 3 accomplishments in any video game bare minimum, Its GD and its not close, I think Trials of death in Mario make is about tied with Tidal wave (I believe that the individual that beat ToD was less equipped to beat it than zoink was to verify tidal wave, I also believe if Mario maker became competitive to the degree of gd, there would easily be more than one person who beats trials of death)",
            "i think coiv and tidal wave are both some bullshit",
            "You can't compare JToH and GD.\n\n\nGeometry Dash relies on precise clicks, jumps, gamemodes and speed to create a level. Not mentioning that it's in 2D.\n\n\nJuke's Towers of Hell relies on various mechanics such as client objects, mechanics, flicks, and glitches to form its towers, which are all in 3D (not minding CoTaW that utilizes a 2D section halfway through).\n\n\nThe building process however is kiinda the same on both games, you build creative gameplay, design it, spend months of your time making the level/tower, and what you get is a finished product that if executed well, will get the hearts of the players that beat it.\n\n\nif anyone asks, hardests are ToCA and a weekly easy demon (I can't remember the name\ud83d\ude2d)",
            "cant be compared. very different games, both based off user generated levels.\njtoh has a much higher skill ceiling potential but gds difficulty has been raised much higher due to a bigger playerbase",

            "kinda obvious, does juke's tower of hell have levels like emptiness",

            "I play both, i\u2019d say they are hard for their own reasons, but JTOH has a greater capacity for difficulty, but GD\u2019s peak is much better explored and explorable\n\nIt being 3D and the fact a whole coding language and engine is used should be all the proof needed for its capability for difficulty",
            "jtoh is younger so ofc it's not as established in terms of difficulty yet\n\nHaven't had a new top 1 for months and it has like 10 victors\n\njtoh has a lot more potential for difficulty than in GD since the movements can become more complex, precise and not to mention that it's 3D which allows for more room in terms of error\n\njumps in jtoh are nearly impossible compared to gd since every tower is different and has many mechanics and different kinds of jumps that need learning, stratting and technicality, while gd is just clicking\n\ngd rn is harder, but jtoh has so much more potential we just beat our first unreal tower like 7 ish months ago which is probably around where bloodlust is now prob\n\nwhat also proves its difficulty is the large community gd has that has beaten an extreme, compared to those who are capable of beating any intense tower in the game\n\nI do play both for the purpose of reliability, hardests are ToGF and diligence",

            "i play both\n\njtoh hardest: tomm \n\ngd hardest: fire temple\n\n\nGD is harder on the average side but when we're talking absolute peaks then JToH is kinda ridiculous, but i'm unsure if Tidal Wave is harder than CoIV",
            "~~well i think it's pretty obvious that geometry dash CAN be harder, i mean it depends on the level, i've played tower of hell before, while it does have a skill curve, it's not even close to a game that would take thousands of hours to beat the hardest stages (at least from when i played, when it was just called tower of hell). Comparing anything in that game to tidal wave is just a non argument. Yes they are different types of difficulty that don't directly translate, but geometry dash can become so much more insane soley based of the fact that tidal wave has jumps that have a 15ms window to click. Comparing toh to stereo madness or like an easy demon though you could probably make an argument. People can beat easy demons in their first 100 hours.~~\n\nEdit: Just learned that tower of hell is not the same as jukes tower of hell",

It\u2019s a better question to ask if JToH breaks into main list demons. If you believe JToH is harder or even on par, that also means you must believe all the top players of GD kinda suck, because they\u2019ve put in more time, for longer, on harder things than anyone who plays JToH has.",

If someone asks you \"Whats harder,Legendary Mode Moonlord,Or Hardcore minecraft without any Armor?\" Then you can't really answer it,Since they're completely different.\n\nJtoh has more potential to be more difficult,Because it has a whole NEW Dimension to deal with,but GD is currently harder,Mostly because its way more popular,So more people made hard stuff in it.\n\nIf Jtoh had the same amount of popularity as GD,Then it would probably be harder,But overall both games are Peak difficulty in terms of any game,Ever made.

            "While they're both very different skillsets that utilize very different mechanics and strategies (and because of this imo they cant be compared); I'm inclined to say that JTOH/tiered towers have a WAY higher skill ceiling compared to geometry dash in terms of what's possible. There's a subsection in the obbyist community dedicated to clearing the hardest individual jumps, requiring an insane amount of precision and timing. The Barcode, Sora No Shinku, Eternally, X.Code... All of these use a myriad of mechanics and tech that abuse roblox's game engine to its limit, and some take dozens of hours to pass a SINGLE jump.\n\nWith respect to JTOH, currently the hardest towers beaten legitimately iirc are CoIV, ToEV, ToTRP; and for tiered obbies Emi Nubu, Back There Benjamin, Ikea Tower. If you have experience with both of these games, compare them to GD's top levels and see for yourself.\n\nPersonally, if you want to compare these two different skillsets, then I''d say they're both VERY close. Some JTOH top players say GD is harder, and some top GD players say JTOH is harder. Problem is I don't recall anybody who's both of these things, which would offer the most unbiased result; it's like being a world renowned chess player and asking them to compare Chess and Scrabble, they're very different skillsets. \n\nI think the best way to measure is just general precision. Individual jumps? Goes to JTOH easily. Timing? GD. Consistency? Both require immense consistency. Reaction time? GD. Mechanics/movement? JTOH due to the insane amount of discovered tech.\n\nAnd if this is relevant; I have kinda good experience with both. My hardest tiered obby is a Tier 11 and have played obbies for many years now. In GD, hardest is Insane demon (both classic and platformer).",
