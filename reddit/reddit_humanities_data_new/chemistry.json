            "Question for former non-PhD core facility staff. Do you feel that working in an academic core facility made it harder to get an industry job?",
            "Hello! I\u2019m looking for some advice from anyone who\u2019s been through the all-too-common experience of a graduating uni with a bad GPA and still wanting to go to grad school. \n\nI graduated in 2019 from UMich with a B.S. in BCN, ~2 years of research experience with one publication as second-author, 3 years of work experience at a startup in drug discovery. I feel confident in getting 3 good LOR from my professor I researched under and my mentors in industry, however, I\u2019m fighting an uphill battle with a 2.45 GPA. \n\nLong story short, I have a parent who relapsed in their opiate addiction during my time in school and my resulting mental health snowballed with a couple bad grades into a tenure I\u2019m not proud of. I went into college wanting to go into higher education for chemistry and rediscovered that love while working on a project at my company, and am ready mentally to do my best in school.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken with some admissions counselors and chair members at various schools in the Midwest and they\u2019ve recommended a plethora of ideas: second B.S., Masters, Post-bacc. Overall another opportunity showing my ability to be successful in the classroom along with more research. \n\nWhat would y\u2019all recommend? If it\u2019s a masters or post-bacc, should I be raising my GPA with classes taken at a community college before applying? Any university or program you\u2019ve had a positive experience with?",

            "Chem adjacent industries\n\nHello all! \n\nI\u2019m a recent grad who\u2019s been working as a lab tech for a little over a year now. While I find the principles that we implement interesting, and my coworkers are great. I honestly don\u2019t see myself doing technical/lab work for the long haul. Are there any \u201cadjacent\u201d industries where I could leverage my chemistry knowledge while being able to work more closely with people or groups?",
            "I'd start by just trying to apply for PhD programs and seeing what happens.\n\nIf that doesn't work out, then I'd switch my sights to a low-cost thesis-based Master's. GPA shouldn't be as big a dealbreaker there.",
            "IMHO you can do this but you have other negatives besides only GPA.\n\nStart by asking your old professor or current employers if they can recommend you to anyone.  A direct referral can skip the application process.  If a PI wants you in their group, they will get your regardless of the application.\n\nWe consider a \"fresh grad\" as someone who has graduated within the last 3 years.  Check deeper into your prereqs for the PhD and some schools require you to have graduated in the last 5 years, or you have to take an exam / GRE.  They may require you to re-take one or two final year classes too, before the PhD coursework starts.  It's not significant, but it is more work they maybe don't want to do compared to other applicants.\n\nThe reason GPA is so valuable is it proves you have the ability to successfully complete 4 years of schooling.  It's a strong predictor that you can complete another 4+ years.  You can explain your reasoning for the previous dip but you have not explained or proven how you prevent bad mental health happening again.  There will be stressful events in the future (maybe not as extreme) and most people that start grad school won't complete (for good reasons too).  The method to prove it is obviously more schooling.  The post-bacc will be cheapest and fastest, plus expose you to new group leaders that may be willing to take you on.  Thesis-only masters is next and second BS is a terrible idea.\n\nGPA calcs can be manipulated in lots of ways and schools will do this to get candidates they like across the line.  You can use final year classes only, or core classes only, or last X years only.  That is why a post-bacc can be done as a quick boost, but it still requires some PI want you.  That's why I recommend finding a PI first before randomly applying as an unknown to the general candidate pool.\n\n[GRE is next-to-worthless](https://cen.acs.org/education/graduate-education/future-GRE/97/i5) for chemistry grad school these days, but it is a positive data point that doesn't cost too much or take that long.",

            "Thanks for the feedback! I appreciate the honesty.\n\nWhat other negatives do you see sticking out and any idea on how to address them before putting in applications? Just trying to give myself the best shot I can - reaching out to a connected PI is a great one!\n\nDo you think going the route of a research-based masters would be a good idea first? Shores my research and grades up. Since postbacc only would help my undergrad GPA so much realistically",
            "cool, thanks! I guess it's not a particularly eccentric exam then",
            "Besides the length since graduation and mental health story as strong negatives, it's okay.  \n\nThe job you have is a maybe but I wouldn't weight it either way.  Main reason people quit grad school is they find a good job.  But a good reason to start grad school is you found the limits at the job when you don't have a PhD.  This is all statement of purpose or interview stuff to convince a PI to take you on board.\n\nI did general admissions two years as an academic and we did hold a few places for hardship applicants.  Either Olympians/athletes or truly brutal emotional stories.  The thing about a hardship story is it usually gets you put into a too-hard box.  Academics have seen lots of people fail to complete for many reasons.  That's all they want in a grad school application, evidence that you will complete.  So we ask why were you unable to maintain a high GPA and all we hear is \"problem\" -> \"no-solution\" and looking at the other people in the queue and think \"easy\".\n\nPost-bacc you can study part time while still working and correct your biggest negative - inability to maintain stability in learning (aka low GPA).  Masters by research is a big time commitment and you can already demonstrate hands-on chemistry skills from your 3 years at a chemistry company, it's of lesser value and it takes longer.  Benefit to a MS by research gives you an opportunity to transition into a PhD in the same group/school or be in contact with other academics.  It's more direct but you may not need it.\n\nI still think your best opportunity is directly contacting academics via your network (old PI you published with, others on the publication, current company colleagues ex-PI). The fact you have a publication beats most other applicants, so don't undersell yourself on that, most grad school applicants don't have any publications.  Doing some legwork and e-mails now doesn't cost you anything and has an okay chance to get you accepted somewhere.",
            "I can definitely see how it\u2019s viewed as that during the application process. In my mind, I was hoping to use it less as an excuse and focus more on - like you alluded to - the solution to what the problem was during undergrad (being the work I\u2019ve put in thus far in research, industry, and myself).\n\nReally respect your opinion for being in the field and working in admissions - do you think it would be better to avoid addressing prior mental health issues in the application process and/or when reaching out to professors? I figured at some point I\u2019d be asked to explain my low GPA and honesty is the best answer lol\n\nThat makes sense on your views of postbacc vs masters. I agree getting my foot in the door with a professor is the next best step, and maybe they\u2019ll have a preference on doing a postbacc/masters while researching in their lab to showcase I\u2019ve worked my way back to being stable enough to excel in the classroom prior to helping with admissions for PhD\n\nAgain, thanks for the helpful advice! Hope none of this comes off as defensive - I really just want to portray myself in the best light and chase my dream.",
            "My opinion only - living with an unwell parent is already a gigantic distraction.  You say that and mention you know in hindsight you should have taken a lower class load or deferred.  That's sufficient explanation.  You still need to back it up with some evidence you have control now (e.g. successful job, re-taking classes).\n\nOnce you bring up mental health you also need to really clearly indicate how you are controlling it today.  You mention a situational trigger of the parent, the outcome was anxiety/stress/depression, you control it by continuing to have therapy at some frequency or self-managed after some treatment and maybe medication.  Right now, as written, you are blaming the grades on bad mental health which is from a single trigger.  That's open, there will be more triggers.\n\nSo... You can take the extra classes and don't need the personal story, or you need the personal story and push through with your current excellent skills (publication, 2 years undergrad experience, relevant job) and have a convincing evidence your mental health is in control with ability to prevent it going backwards.  Not being rude: there are no pity points, we need you to be functioning for 5 years to complete, we aren't here to fix you."

I found these to be very helpful while I was applying, and thought I would put this out here now that my job search is complete.\n\nAs some background, I am from Missouri and attended a public university in Missouri. As a result, almost all of my applications were sent to companies in Missouri or in the neighboring Midwest. Before my graduation, I had probably sent out around 10-20 applications between March-May, without much luck. Once I graduated however, I created a LinkedIn, Indeed, Handshake and Glassdoor account and began to apply to most of the jobs in my surrounding area. I would say 100+ of my applications were sent in the past month (Late May - June) alone.\n\nWhile in uni, I did around 2.5 years of undergraduate research with a lab focused on organic chemistry. I also obtained a summer internship at a large chemical company as a QC intern one summer. I really enjoyed undergraduate research and therefore mainly focused on bench chemist/R&D based roles during my application process.\n\nI found that most of the companies that contacted me back generally had around 3 interviews, with the first being a generic interview with HR, the second being a virtual interview with chemists/lab managers, and the third being an in-person lab tour/interview. Of the 8 interview requests I got, I received 2 offers.\n\nThe first offer came right as I graduated, and was for a bench chemist position in a small town in Arkansas. I ended up rejecting the offer as I thought the town was too small and far from family. This job offered a base pay of 26.00$ an hour with a yearly bonus of an undisclosed amount.\n\nThe second offer was for an R&D chemist position in Missouri. This position offered a salary of 65k with benefits and I accepted this offer.",

And so when IUPAC decided that element 16 should be spelled as 'sulfur' \u2014 either in 1971 (ref. 1) or 1990 (ref. 2) depending on the source \u2014 there should be no argument about whether there should be a 'ph' in there or not. It is not a question of American or Oxford English spelling, it is a given name \u2014 and 'correcting' such a name to a different spelling is wholly inappropriate. What would Fred Flintstone say if we insisted on spelling his name Phred Phlintstone! Just to hammer the point home, IUPAC only accepts alternative spellings for two elements, and neither of them is sulfur: 'aluminum' and 'cesium' are fair game, although Nature Chemistry uses aluminium and caesium.\n\nIUPAC is the arbiter. Chemistry follows the law of \"they who smelt it dealt it\" when it comes to naming. you made the stuff, you can publish whatever the journal will let you, no matter how outlandish. Until IUPAC rules. Then, the law is the law, and we expunge all antiquated name schemes. Where possible.",
