I just logged off due to panic, now my question is what's going to happen with my character? I haven't logged on since as I'm afraid she might be dead already, or I'm still surrounded by the hundreds of zeds I left behind. I'm scared to log in, what should I do?\n\nMaybe it's a silly question, I don't know but I'm genuinely seeking help with this. Also it's a live server meaning time goes on even without players being on, will the zeds move away from me in this case?",

            "Hey guys, I've got a question, i build my base in Muldraugh Mass-Genfac Co. warehouse, I decided to expand on the second floor a bit, so sledged some railings and built some floors\n\nProblem 1: Newly placed floors are considered to be outdoors. How do I fix that? \n\nProblem 2: I've tried to fix that by building wooden floors on the third floor to maybe make that a viable roof. That didn't work so I disassembled wooden floors on the third floor and now I have holes in the roof. \nHow can I patch the holes with the same texture as the rest of the roof? The first problem still stands. \n\nI've seen youtubers that were able to somehow make viable roofing on second floor expansion and I've tried using debug mode to perhaps place tiles that are in the game but haven't found that option\n\nPlease help \ud83d\ude4f",
            "Yooo first comment, Is it true that b42 should be released in the first half of the year? Or was it postponed? I'm just not in the subject and haven't been interested in it for a long time",
            "Non cheese way. Use crowbars. Maintenance is leveled when you hit something, and whatever you hit it with doesn\u2019t take damage. Crowbars have the lowest chance of that happening, so for obvious reasons it\u2019s the best.\u00a0\n\nFor cheesing, apparently you can shove a garage door, and that will lvl it up, but I\u2019ve never done this so can\u2019t confirm it.\u00a0",
            "Another vote for the crowbar.  But also, selecting a trait or profession that increases maintenance (or any skill), will give that skill an XP gain % boost.  Maintenance levels much faster if you chose repair man or chef/burger flipper.  Also selecting the handy trait for -8 will give a boost.  Finally I think fast learner also affects the speed it levels.",
            "Well, we're one step closer to that in b42 with model joining animations. No promises tho, of course",
            "for an ingame method just get propane tanks, a torch and a welding mask. Gives you plenty of metalworking xp and resources as well. Alternatively you can just tow and push wrecks to the sides of the road.",

The\u00a0[West Point](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/West_Point)\u00a0and\u00a0[Riverside](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Riverside)\u00a0shopping district each have a hardware store.\n* Pawn shops and military surplus stores have a high chance of spawning machetes. Both can be found in\u00a0[Louisville](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Louisville).\n* Machetes can spawn in metal shelves in warehouses.\n* Machetes can also be found inside barricaded buildings.",
            "Usually random servers advertise from time to time on here, and sometimes you see random Workshop mods that are made for X server, but as far as I know there's no dedicated resource for finding them. Every server is a Discord community like everything nowadays, so it doesn't make it easy to find them. I imagine if you simply ask and make a post, saying you want an RP server or a casual PvE server or whatever you'll get some hits judging by past threads.",
            "There\u2019s a PZ discord that has a sub thread for servers. Both servers advertising and people looking.\u00a0",
            "If I understand correctly, any cells you load as you advance towards peak day will have permanently lower values since you first loaded in the cell before peak day.\n\nFor example, day 1 you spawn in Rosewood and the starting cell on day 1 of 28 has, random number here, 100 zombies. If you drive into Muldraugh on day 7 of 28, then maybe that cell has 250 zombies as the desired max, but if you had got there on day 1 it may have only been 100.\n\nSo after the first 28 days are over, any cell you go to will have the peak population, but any cells you already explored will have a reduced amount depending on how early you first loaded the cell.",

            "Given recent [news](https://www.reddit.com/r/projectzomboid/comments/1dj4jcm/lemmy_speaks_out_against_the_spiteful_community/), it will definitely be postponed until later this year (if even that). The devs are apparently stressed out of their minds, pulling their hair out, and regret ever saying \"first half of this year\". That timeframe was apparently a very optimistic estimate, and things got so bad they even considered selling the company.",
            "\"First half of the year\" was an approximate timeframe that was given by one dev back in december 2023, in a reply of a comment on reddit. But it doesn't look like they will make it in time.\n\nThey have very recently decided to polish and bug-fix what they currently have to release it publically in beta state, instead of waiting for the crafting overhaul to be fully complete.\n\nThough they haven\u2019t worked out exactly what will be in the first iteration of b42, there\u2019ll still be a lot of new crafting for people to sink their teeth into, from stuff like the blacksmithing, pottery, woodworking, food preservation, extra fluid and workstation mechanics, new crafting system and much more. Certain crafting tech trees they\u2019d hoped to be in the initial 42 Unstable release will be pushed back though, to avoid any more unnecessary delays.",

            ">*but any cells you already explored will have a reduced amount depending on how early you first loaded the cell.*\n\nAnd that is specifically because I turned off Zombie spawn?  But if I left zombie spawn as default, then the hypothetical day 1 cell could climb to the example peak of 250?   What I'm reading is that by turning off zombie spawn, the cell I'm currently in gets excluded from that day 1 to day 30 population climb, right?",
            "Thanks for the response, I'll probably log back on today and see what happens then.",

            "Its not a mod, you can push cars in vanilla. Just bump into the car as slow as possible so you dont damage your own ride and then once youre touching floor it. Helps to have a car with good acceleration. \n\nIts often easier to just tow cars out of the way though, less risk of breaking your own car and faster. Less convenient though as youll have to hop out, hook them together and get back in every time though so Id push cars close to the sides out of the way and tow those in the middle of the road.",
            "You're correct. With respawn disabled, loaded cells get locked at whatever their first loaded 'desired population' is. Even if you come back later, the cell's already loaded and set to that lower desired population because it was visited prior to peak day.\n\nWith respawn on, the desired population of the cell will continue to rise until peak day whether or not you've loaded that cell before.",

            "This is exciting. I was getting rather worried about how almost every \u201cupdate\u201d regarding build 42 also involved showcasing some sort of new deep mechanic being added. Not that I don\u2019t appreciate everything TIS does or that I think I know better, I just love the game and am rather excited! \n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s challenging to gauge what goes into an update and what doesn\u2019t - especially when working on something you\u2019re so passionate about. \n\nYou see similar in other games. Stardew Valley dev decided to add more features to the 1.6 update in a bug fix patch a few weeks after 1.6 dropped. And he\u2019s still going to have to port all that over to console! Just creating more work for himself out of the love of making the game better haha. \n\nI\u2019m sure whatever ends up being added will satiate most of us for a while. Especially once mods will be able to settle back in and utilize new features / improvements.",

There\u2019s so much to look forward to already in this build that I\u2019d gotten nervous a few thursoids back when they stated they planned to duplicate the entire crafting tree. I\u2019m happy keeping my trucks running through scavenging for now, thanks!",

            "I had no idea about the map glow up! That alone is giving me hype.",
            "So it's a least 2 months away at minimum for unstable, even with them holding back some of the work. I was hoping this Thursdoid would be the one they announced it. Oh well. I'm sure it will be worth the wait.",

            "Map upgrades look really cool. Lighting though not integral, seems very nice to boost the atmosphere. And a bit of new collection items to loot is fun, but god this really sucks. Though you should probably only listen to official channels, I believe a lot of people were going off of the dev that said unstable in first half of 2024, and now finding out that we won't even get that despite them reeling in some of the crafting certainly is disappointing. I for one was thinking we might be getting an unstable date now, and being told its not even imminent sucks. \n\nOn one hand we shouldn't hate on this, as this at the very least points towards there being no crunch culture at TIS, and as supporters we should be happy. But it is hard to then know where the line is between a healthy development cycle and a slow one, as most would probably believe this to be the latter. \n\nYou can criticize TIS for the speed of updates, sure. But at the end of the day there is no reason to hate, if you're in this sub I assume it's because you love this game and want to see the team succed. But yeah this one sucks and there's nothing to do about it other than hoping the team will deliver when the time comes.",
            "I wonder if their speed of development is bottlenecked by funding or if it's something else. The time between updates has left me (and many others, I'm sure) quite jaded.\n\nI love this game, I've been playing on and off for over a decade now, but come on man. I'm growing old here",
            "Every Thursdoid that comes out I'm like, ok what have you added to B42 now? I thought this patch was animals, crafting, and backend work to add NPCs later.\n\nNot redesigned cities, new key chains, new lighting systems, multiplayer wars, newspapers, collectables, basements, more floors, item look variations, visual refresh, ambient noise, gun upgrades, procedurally generated wilderness, code refactoring as a result of all of the above... scope creep has massively impacted this patch and I think TIS really need to bring an expert in to get a handle on this. A proper project manager. Because this is ridiculous.\n\nDid some of this need to be done as part of the crafting update, like gun upgrades and the wilderness, yeah probably. But did redesigned cities? I've seen a lot of EA projects and I would expect updated visuals and a major map revamp as the single last update before launch not included in a mechanics update.\n\nPlease put unstable out instead of giving us sexy keychains.",

            "Oh boy, the amount of expectation management in this post",
            "It looks like it's going to be awesome when it comes out, but it's a pitty some content isn't going to make it, I hope they still can add the machinery system (the one they used to craft orange juice when they showed it) into the game.",

            "Not the biggest fan of the Muldraugh glow up, I like the new models, but they don't really fit the rural sh*thole vibe that the originals have. They would, however look fantastic in West Point.",
            "really disappointing one tbh, i feel like we're hearing about the same things since last summer. and now we're hearing about these things being cut back for unstable ? \n\nmap rework looks sick tho",
            "8 paragraph long explanation just to say \"we are cutting the crafting content that we advartised for the last year\". \n\nGreat job guys! Not only you are working at a tortoise pace, you are also cutting the content that slightly justifies your development speed. Only thing decent in this post is the lighting. \n\nBut, I can understand you. I would also get lazy if my community will be sold to the addition of a couple of buildings and keychains in a 1 month development time.",
            "Muldraugh buildings looking quite nice ngl, hope the rest of the towns will also get a second pass eventually. They're big enough from a... horizontal perspective ? But could really use a vertical glow-up like this as well that doesn't change their identity or the \"balance\" too much, even if it's maybe not that realistic considering the time and place (no idea). \n\nCrafting being taken out of Unstable is kind of a big bummer considering that's 90% of what I'm interested in, but eh.",
            "Lol, so they're doing basically what they ended up doing when MP was about to drop, it was Christmas time and they're like hey guys, ya know what? It's not perfected yet but here's MP earlier than what we were planning on.",

            "I\u2019m glad TIS has listened to the people. I trust it was quite alarming when even on this very own subreddit, people were clamoring for the release of the unstable. With reasons of feature creep being the hold up.",
            "Y'know, putting aside the embarrassingly long development time here, it'd be nice if, on the rare occasions where I see devs interacting with people, they weren't being smarmy jerks at even the lightest criticism. Like, they have to be aware that these abnormally long development times and that's why people are annoyed, right?",
            "Not sure how to feel about the map changes. The redesigns looks really cool, but way too high-class for Muldraugh, especially Muldraugh in 1993. It looks less backwater and podunk, and more like the outskirts of Louisville.\n\nI think they can use that police station in another town, but I think the one for Muldraugh should maybe have a single floor and a chainlink fence. That new fence looks like something you'd expect the military to put up. Unless there's the implication that some of the exterior was only added in the few days before the game begins.\n\nI like the touch-ups that the old locations are getting, but I hope their rural aesthetic isn't sacrificed in the process. That's what I really liked about them, that they weren't just fancy cities or high-class towns. They were just towns.\n\nI'm sure map mods can change that if these are \"permanent\" upgrades, but hopefully the rural feel of the towns aren't completely taken away in B42.\n\nOther than that, these Thursdoids don't really feel up-to-par. Feels like we're waiting a month just to get more of, \"Hey, B42 still isn't out yet, no idea when lol, look at the fancy lighting and the CHICKENS!\" They're still cool, but it just feels samey.\n\nI just hope the world doesn't end first at this point, because that would be disappointing. :)",
            "Are animals off the table now for this update?\n\nHope not, as lighting updates and new crafting trees, while nice, aren't what most of us are looking for after the last update.",
            "I'll just assume this year means next year like I should've in the first place.",
            "Its hilarious how damn bad these devs are at doing literally anything.  Years and years and years between any updates good god at some point just make the video game.  I bought this game 12 YEARS AGO with promises for a game that will never be made.  \n\nAt this point I tune in about once a year to see whats up and every check in is simply pathetic.  Were on what year 3? 4? of this patch and all they can say is \"it will be unstable and buggy and missing features and worse than you think...and also its not coming any time soon\".  Their big update of this news update is to cover their ass for the fact that IT SUCKS LMAO. So is anyone actually making this game?\n\nSpending 10 years to do what? Add cars to a video game? Give the player animations? What the hell have they actually done in the span of a decade",
            "Very mixed feelings about this one.\n\nI would prefer a delay rather than see content be cut, but I understand a lot of people are frustrated with the development timeline. Also, it's pretty clear to me that TIS struggles with knowing when to stop adding extraneous features to an update, so maybe it's for the best.\n\nNow, as for Muldraugh. Funnily enough, I was just commenting today on another thread about how Muldraugh in-game is a perfect reflection of the quintessential run down rural American town. The old police station, school, and church were very fitting for a small, poor town like Muldraugh. For instance, the old church they showed being replaced in this blog is basically a 1-1 replica of one of the actual churches in IRL Muldraugh if you look at satellite imagery. Now they're seemingly being replaced with gargantuan structures that verge on being unrealistic for the size of town we're talking about here - a town with a population of 1000 in 2024, a 20% poverty rate, and a median household income half that of the national average. Hell, the town doesn't even have sidewalks for the most part.\n\nPart of what attracted me to PZ in the first place was that it wasn't flashy like other zombie games. The experience felt realistic, and part of that was the environments - it really felt like you were wandering in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse in rural America. I get that they want to use the new tiles they have and get Muldraugh up to speed with the detail of the newer towns, but it feels like they're sacrificing the feel of the city in the process. \n\nThe other content, especially the lighting, looks good. But I really hope they reconsider those changes to Muldraugh.",
            "Personally, I have not cared at all about the crafting changes, and a lot of this is plenty fine for me. I've really liked the \"finding random crap and making it work\" aspect of Zomboid, and I was never a fan of craftables. I think they generally make the game a lot more boring and discourage adventuring out for things you need.",
            "Man, I'm chomping at the bit just for all the visual updates.",
            "so where is this weeks? or am I still not clear on how this works?",
            "I'm really trying but this is bullshit. Same thing as rimworld fix the broken shit before you put more crap in it.",
            "Obviously a bit disappointed that features are being cut however it seems like we will still have blacksmithing to play with which is what most are looking forward to. \n\nDoes anyone know if animals are dropping with this update?",
            "I noticed in the school building upgrade screenshot that it has ladders on the roof. I know there's already some decorative ladders in the game, but considering the tile depth and new building heights being added this update I wonder if they'll finally let us use ladders.",
            "What angers me, is that the goal post on the muldraugh soccer field (bottom right) is off center. Game is literally unplayable.",
            "Not sure how I feel about the Muldraugh glow up tbh. The images show such huge changes, I'm not sure it fits Muldraugh's vibe. I mean, these big buildings would feel more at home in Louisville. But maybe I have my nostalgia glasses on. I'm still excited to explore them.\n\nGood to see the unstable beta is just around the corner, even without the full crafting in place. Looking forward to it !",
            "Developers out here pretending like they didn't smugly shoot down the naysayers earlier this year by saying it'd obviously be released H1 2024. Now they're just for the first time acknowledging there is zero high level management happening, they should probably rein in the autistic freelance feature creep, and the current state of their build is far from playable. \ud83e\udd23",
            "I really really do like this alot as the game felt like it was slowly growing more and more stale, the playerbase dwindling and features so utterly nebulous on the horizon. hope the wrap up wont take too long and im more than excited to finally partake in the cavalcade of new features!",
            "bruh the wording in the first few sentences made me think they were dropping the update\n\n\u201cMy disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.\u201d",

            "bruh its prob coming somewhere around september - december because they mentioned that the build is still buggy and needs more work",
            "> As such the Unstable build is not imminent, but with this readjustment of our plans the pile of stuff that needs to be done before release has gotten a lot shorter.

            "I totally understand that people, and TIS, are both annoyed at how much feature creep has made its way into the plans for Build 42; this is a very reasonable cause for delays.\n\n>People would much rather see the build out and get to play with all it has to offer, rather than be upset about the things never made it into the first Unstable release as originally planned.\n\nI am unsure if I am in the minority or not, but I don't mind that this is taking so long. I have a lot of other games to play, and I do keep popping into Zomboid and playing a run every now and then. I'm patient. I think I may be in the latter category if they release the Unstable version without all of the features they're working on. I don't understand the need to rush and postpone features for the sake of getting an Unstable branch ready. If it's all in scope for Build 42, take all the time you need. This build is shaping up to be an absolute banger, but getting it into our hands before it's finished or ready for testing may sour the experience.\n\nOn the other hand, getting feedback early for what you already have done so you can work on it while finishing the build is a good idea. I'm unsure if this is the goal for releasing it early though. I sense, based on the language, that it's a matter of wanting to rush instead of a matter of quality. These builds have always taken years, but everyone continues to love the game and the work you put in. Getting feedback early might actually delay the features you're still finishing, unless you have idle hands that you want to use. If this was the mentality, I would be totally on board to start testing the Unstable build while the rest is finished, but instead it sounds like rushing for the sake of rushing.\n\n>stubbornly holding things back until we get there it only going to delay people getting a hold on all the other cool stuff in the Build that they\u2019ve been waiting for.\n\nIn my opinion - so what? What is the value in reducing the delay of the cool stuff you've been working on? Does anybody actually care about receiving the build in a timely manner?\n\nI am very curious to know if people are on this page or have different opinions about this.",

We haven't played it constantly those 8 years, sometimes there's a year or two gap so it feels fresh again. I shouldn't be doing that with a game that lists itself as a early-access game.\n\nMy life has changed a lot in 8 years, PZ, not as much as I'd hoped.  \nI have hope still. I'm not angry at the devs at all, I program and develop things too, but I have to manage my own projects and things on my own. If I had a team like PZ did, I don't think it'd still be dragging at a snails pace with repeated updated every month.\n\nWe used to get more content updates and progress with the weekly updates sometimes, let alone the monthly ones.\n\nSorry, I had to go out and say my part.

I can't think of a single police station I've ever seen that has a double sided barbed wire fence with a concrete base, gatehouse, and a giant garage with skylights in it. The county jail and state police office down the street from me doesn't even have that kind of security (or architecture.)\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like that these buildings are getting attention again, but it seems like such a stark departure from what we've seen even in the new towns you guys are working on.\n\nIt's such an interestingly choice to set the game in rural Kentucky and it's that exact atmosphere of a rural town, as opposed to some generic city, that drew me to the game. Now, it feels like that atmosphere is being stripped away in favor of making Muldraugh into a generic city.",

The building *looks nicer* than the old one, because it's got a less boxy shape and more details, but it's hard to imagine a town like Muldraugh even having the resources or funding to construct something like it, and it's questionable why they would need it.\n\nIMO it's missing the vibe and feels out of place. It's a great design, but it would feel much more at home in a larger town or city.",

It could be a completely fictional town and road layout and I wouldn't mind. What I liked was the immersive feel of exploring a real rural American town that's been overtaken by the zombie apocalypse, and to me it seems like the newer buildings have lost that feel.\n\nUsing the parking lot to the left as a measurement, it appears the new police station has around double the footprint of the old one, including now having a second story and a fence. The new school looks to be largely the same footprint, but it's now a two story building. Church is the same size as I can tell, but generally a lot fancier with stained glass windows.\n\nThis is just my opinion, of course. But I don't think adding more detail to existing towns necessarily mandates making the buildings larger, or appear more \"fancy.\" Arguably, introducing more depictions of wear and tear could be more visually interesting.",

I agree that most servers probably won't end up utilizing the whole \"no need to ever reset the map\" thing but I know tons of people including myself who would greatly appreciate being able to do a completely primitive run without needing to use a huge host of crafting mods and still needing to spawn yourself the few essentials.\n\nThat being said I do agree with the devs that it's not needed right off rip.

Sure, more frequent updates break mods or whatever, but updates keep people coming back and engaged with the game. Take Stardew Valley, for example, which released in January 2016 by a single developer. 1.1 was released in October of that year, and after various updates even had multiplayer released in August 2018. But ConcernedApe didn't stop with that, and added even more content with 1.4 in 2019 and 1.5 in 2020. The developer even started work on a new game before coming back to drop 1.6 in 2024. And that's just one example, to say nothing of the other games that will be started and completed before Zomboid. \n\n> a game that's a lot better than most AAA\n\nAt least these AAA games generally tend to be finished products.\n\n> They could release build 42 and call that the full release and call it a day, but they won't, they will keep working to provide even more content at their own pace\n\nYep, I'm sure it'll finish one of these years, just like Dwarf Fortress...\n\nEdit: Lmao they blocked me within 2 minutes of my reply.

Lastly, I imagine a lot of these crafts le weapons such as bows and crossbows will have non crafted pre apocalypse versions available for early game so I don't think that will be a problem either.\n\nOverall I get what you're and don't necessarily disagree but I really don't think the end result will allow players to look like mad max medieval soldiers a few weeks into the end of the world.",

Hell, we already know of several features that won't make the cut but have already been explored and worked on, maybe those will get added with following updates before the focus fully shifts to B43, it'd make sense.\n\nSo ultimately, the guy's probably gonna end up right at the end of the day. \n\nNot that I condone the attitude, mind you, just saying.",
            "I certainly hope so. One of my favorite base locations relies on this fence to not be overrun, since it's kind of next-door to one of the most disproportionately high population cells (relative to surrounding cells) in the map (which leads to a nigh-endless stream of wandering Zombies, even on tame settings). This change kind of kills that location as a potential base, except if you have a *massive* amount of players there.\n\nBrick fences certainly help, but it turns bases that previously took a lot of work to get going (outside of a few given houses, most locations with such a fence lacked many amenities and required the player to have decent skills to obtain appliances) into bases that take a *crapton* more work to get going.",

But keep using that as an excuse for a dev team taking over ten years to release a single feature they promised, when they\u2019ve even said themselves the main reason the game still exists in early access is because they haven\u2019t fulfilled that specific promise yet.\n\nLike I said before, game is fun as is so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m looking for a refund or something. But if you don\u2019t see this situation as ridiculous as I\u2019ve described it, then there\u2019s nothing I can say to counter your copium.\n\nEDIT: Also you post in GenZ.

            "Sure. What I mean is that they\u2019re putting hundreds of hours in creating things that only a fraction of the players will use and they will get along with a specific scenario and purpose, instead of improving or including stuff that should be core parts or tools of the game.\n\nIs like spending years in designing a system of  autonomous driving for a car but not including four wheels in it.\n\nThey\u2019re saying the crafting system is so complex that they need to fraction it, but still we don\u2019t have proper animations for cars, sitting/sleeping, showering\u2026 fire sprites that look like Super Mario from the NES\u2026 no bikes, no throwable weapons, no physical changes on the characters based on how much they weight or the exercise they make.\n\nI don\u2019t know. I understand that different players have different priorities. But for a game that is trying to be \u201crealistic\u201d, I do prefer to see a realistic approach on what I see in-game vs. a realistic approach for how a complex system works by using boring UI windows.\n\nEven a simple animation like the character kneeling and opening their bag to take or leave heavy objects, does a lot to feel more immersed, instead of 99% of the animations of the game looking like the character is solving a rubik cube.\n\nIf the character carries extra stuff, create 2-3 walking and running animations that portray that feeling. Instead we have animations that look like the character is trying not to shit on his pants.\n\nAgain\u2026 sometimes I feel like they take the game to the \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter the looks of it\u201d and they\u2019re happy with the players filling these gaps like if they\u2019re playing some D&D.",
            "They are different games with different goals, I followed Kenshi from its earliest days of development, I played the Zomboid demo when it first came out, the only difference is one had the 'came out' label and the other continued development. Nobody has gotten less because Zomboid didn't wrap things and start making a sequel, there is so much more to the game than NPCs - which are being introduced in the form of animals soon already.",
