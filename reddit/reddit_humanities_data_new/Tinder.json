            "Replace first picture with a similar one in higher quality / better light. If you do any kind of sports, (even if just occasionally) show it. Speaking from the pics, you seem somewhat lonely -> add at least one picture indicating you participate in society (with friends/party/...). Replace 3-4 with those. Maybe a more \"funny\"/surprising one with the cat. Then alternate the pictures - dont put similar ones like 1-2 in a row",
            "Photo 1: your face should never take up the entire screen. Instant left swipe for most. Take a normal photo from farther away where you can at least see your torso and then the sky or whatever else above you.\n\nPhoto 2: same deal\n\nPhoto 3: it's low quality and not in a vintage way, but it is your best photo because it looks like a photo people would take for the hell of it.\n\nPhoto 4: ehhh quality and you shouldn't take selfies from a downward angle. Looks like you're in an office/library or something which, together with your appearance, gives off too much of that vibe.\n\nPhoto 5: You're hiding your face.\n\nPhoto 6: You already look friendly so you don't need a photo with a cat. You have the most serious expression here so it just seems like a big mismatch lol",

            "I think the third pic should be your main",
            "you have too many selfies, you need a few pictures that are professionally taken along with some that show a bit of your character, like let\u2019s say you a hockey fan, a pic of you in hockey stadium or something",
            "It looks like all 5 pics are from 2 days. At least throw on some different shirts. You need more variety.",

            "to be blunt: all your pictures are ass. They are low quality, with sunglasses, non-smiling, selfies.. all general no-goes. This app is entirely visual. You need to up your visual-game",
            "Good profile. If i wanted to be nitpicky: the quality of your photos needed to increase and you may want a social photo. Otherwise you got everything going you would need to be successful",
            "You look wellput together with a really nice smile, i would crop the third picture, as your lower body is not positioned very elegantly, and there is too much details in the picture.",
            "Hey man try swapping out that first pic. Gives sort of degenerate vibes. Try adding some pics that are clearer for your face. They\u2019re all either distant or at an angle",
            "Hey man great start. Pic with the boom mic is your best one for sure. Try to swap some of these out to give your face better lighting. Also having two pics of the popcorn eating isn\u2019t adding much. You got this man.",
            "Hey man! You\u2019re a handsome dude so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do fine. Try some shots with your full face visible. They are all kinda looking at an angle. A shot with a smile and looking directly at the camper would be nice. Good luck\u2019",
            "I really like the pics. Improvement: First picture should always be alone, switch with the last one or a similar one u prefer. But definitely keep the first one, just make it 2nd. Move either 4,6 or 7 to 3d in the sequence as they are catchy/surprising. Maybe remove 5 as you already have 2 other shirtless ones and i would keep the funny one and the concert/festival one shows some variety.",
            "You come across as very serious. You don't look like you'd be fun to hang out with (which you probably are, but it needs to show in your pictures). And the drink picture...just why? what purpose does it serve you.. what does it tell about you. just odd",
            "Ok great thanks good to know! Really depends where I am, I\u2019m back home now (Austria) and it\u2019s going terribly haha (1 like this week). Bumble is working much better for me, I might give Hinge a try",

            "Some changes  I would make would be to have the 2nd picture with the two dogs as your first picture and then your 2nd picture the one on the mountain with your hat and hoodie you have a lot of pictures with animals perhaps too many for a dating app one or two are fine but it's almost every picture and it's a bit too much.",

Fit American girl here for the gig. Agreed Sunday to go to the beach. Picked her up at 12 with a picnic and went to the beach which was super nice. She was confident and had a banging body, dark hair and great smile. Looked awesome in a bikini. We had fun at the beach and then came back and went to a few pubs. Back to mine for really good sex, she left that night at like 2am. \n\nWent again Monday evening with J, 26, polish. Also here for the event. Took her to a few spots in town for aperol, wine and small plates. Blonde with a nice body though not as fit as T. Went back to her hotel for sex, she was a bit of a freak and I stayed over, ordered room service breakfast. \n\nShame there aren\u2019t more of these events!!",

Kinda made a scene in front of the folks at the bar and the woman I was actually on a date with. Luckily I handled it with laughter and aplomb and said date is now my GF of nearly a year."

If it\u2019s execptional and you\u2019ve made out at this point I might think of a third place to go.

I remember being actually nervous and starting to second-guess if I was actually in need of medical attention or just had a really unique flu.\n\n*Almost immediately* the ER staff knew what was going on, practically identified it as an appendicitis before I got checked in. The smug look on my parents vanished almost right away and I remember just being in too much pain to even want to wallow in the victory.\n\nBy the time I was knocked out and surgery had begun my appendix had ruptured but luckily survived to tell the tale. My parents *kinda* still underplay the absolute severity of having a ruptured appendix means. Like I said earlier, if it was raining that day and they *again* refused to take me in I probably would've died a few hours later. Most people *don't* survive ruptured appendixes, that's usually the \"you waited too long\" point.\n\nAnyways, thanks for listening.

            "Cool. You sound SO nice and respectful towards women. With your attitude and logic, it really seems like you should be drowning in pussy. It\u2019s a shame that you\u2019re too pathetic to understand your problem. You\u2019re not losing to anyone except yourself \ud83d\ude18",
            "lol where\u2019d you get that from?",
            "even if they are looking for a hookup \u2026 you see nothing wrong?! this seems like the right way to do it?",
            "Surely someone rich or attractive would be able to do better than me \ud83d\ude04\nSelf deprecating humour aside, you seem like you\u2019re projecting dear.",
            "This is bumble...",
            "\u201cjUst use bUMbLe\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, she was.",
            "Bumble sucks",
            "Nope, it's extreme laziness. They're looking for a sure thing, and don't want to waste time on someone who they have to win over. They figure if they try it on enough women, they'll eventually find a couple who are down. Not sure if any of them really succeed, but that's the thinking. Also, the golden rule is to blame. We want to this to happen to us by a moderately attractive woman so badly, we v assume they would also like it, so long as they find us reasonably physically attractive. Women don't work that way.",
            "It started normal and then mid way through horniness out of nowhere.",
            "It\u2019s a mix of:\n\n1) Guys who are trying to come off as confident/\u201calpha\u201d and throw off lines they\u2019d like to hear if you flipped the script. They assume since they think graphic comments from the first sentence is hot, girls will too. Too much porn and poor YT/TikTok/Insta dating advice.\n\n2) Guys who\u2019ve given up getting dates and just want jerk off material. Same with a lot of married guys.",
            "We complain. We give you the evidence. We still get questioned if it's real. Disappointed, but not surprised.",
            "Never considered this angle before but from a business sense for Tinder it kind of makes sense. It's ultimately destructive to them though. \n\nA lot of other sites use bot profiles. In the past I've received \"I like your profile\" type messages before I've even put a proper profile up. I'm talking literally writing \"will fill this in shortly\" and no profile pics and I'm getting contacted",
            "Mate, it\u2019s because of dudes like this that other men clean up on tinder.",
            "It\u2019s a hookup app.",
            "I heard the sigh as they wrote that",
            "For real, I actually wanna message normally and shit but they don't even reply half the time and these are the guys I'm losing to????",
            "They get messaged first because it\u2019s how bumble works!!",
            "nah you just pity yourself so much that women are turned off by it",
            "Ace",
            "Then you get the money up front",
            "It's ridiculous. Creeps don't wear hats saying, \"I'm a creep\" just like murderers often blend in with \"normal\" people. Why do women still get blamed for this shit lol.",
            "lol very understandable, I was being sarcastic. Twas a joke",
            "\nI am not looking for a hookup and totally agree. Definitely don\u2019t think this is the right way to go about looking for casual sex either.",
            "I've been on the receiving end a few times of this forwardness a few times. Personally not my kind thing but if you're both seeking a quick hookup being honest and direct wastes less time I suppose?",
            "Lol yes, I am SO tired of women WANTING me as a bald, poor male.  \n\nI ALWAYS lead with sex, because of course you KNOW that works, right?  \n\nI mean, obviously it does for them, otherwise they wouldn't do it?  Right?",
            "THen why post it on the Tinder Subreddit?",
            "Then she should have posted it in the Bumble sub.",
            "Wrong. Women will reciprocate very very nasty bullshit if they think you're hot.",
            "Nah, I could see the \"play with my balls\" question coming from a mile away, he clearly set that up with his tennis question. I bet in his mind he thought it was a smooth transition",
            "Yeah but that fucking ruins it for the rest of us. Great fun dating these days.",
            "Super self absorbed and honestly dysfunctional of you to interpret this comment as \u201cquestioning women\u201d. \n\nI would bet both my nuts the OP was actually trying to ask, like a, \u201chey maybe there are bots on tinder to piss the women off too\u201d kind of question, but that\u2019s me",
            "bumble isn\u2019t really a hookup app",
            "They get matched first *",
            "Then why do all my matches just run out without any messages? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
            "Lol, shit, you're right. Good on you for saying more than \"Hey.\"",
            "I don\u2019t get messaged first on bumble, they all just expire lmao",
            "Way to make it personal. Lol. I'm doing just fine. You're oblivious if you think my first comment isn't accurate, though. Same reason attractive women don't have to be interesting in the text messaging. Thirsty guys will keep talking. Obviously, generalities aren't 100%, but it's a lot.",
            "Which, when you take a step back, is kind of a crazy thing to be turned off by, not gonna lie.",
            "Well this is coming from men whose profiles said they were looking for \u201ca long term relationship\u201d. Regardless I don\u2019t see why they have to be gross about it like this. Could easily be \u201cI\u2019m only looking to hook up, are you on the same page\u201d kinda stuff.",
            "Problem is that you are going to lose most of the woman who are up for a hookup. You know all the ones that want to play around of tennis and who after they decide you aren't nuts, invite you over to take a shower and clean up...\n\nStuff like this is a violation of tinders TOS/Community guidelines where unsolicated sexual advances are not allowed. Report and move on.",
            "Because there's often posts from various other dating apps. It's not really just a tinder subreddit",
            "You\u2019re still 100% incorrect on your statement but go off",
            "Hot men can get away with more, but the vast majority of women are still rejecting the dude in this post. Just a lower amount, than if they're average to slightly above average",
            "Just to be clear the second guy was the conventional \u201chot\u201d guy. As the comments above said there\u2019s only so much even hot guys can get away with.",
            "Doesn't matter how hot he is if he's a douchebag. Hot men aren't in short supply on the ladies' side of things. We can afford to pass them up, too.",
            "Lol, sure pal. I think you are just saying that to justify your inability to attract women",
            "If you\u2019re literally window shopping a person\u2026 it\u2019s going to devolve into a hookup app. They all will. Bar none.",
            "I was thinking the same thing. If he wanted a hookup he could just state it on his profile and not be like **tOuCh mY bALLs** out of nowhere",
            "Is that like a fart?  \"butt go off?\"  LUL",
            "I'm speaking from experience \ud83e\udd37",
            "I mean they aren't necessarily entirely wrong, but that type of thinking tends to get exaggerated. You get away with much more, but this also has its limits. \n\nLet's not pretend my handsome awkward bros out there don't have a struggle as well.",
            "What experience? Are you calling yourself hot? Are you calling yourself a hot asshole?\n\nPretty arrogant, dont you think?",
            "It\u2019s pretty sad."
