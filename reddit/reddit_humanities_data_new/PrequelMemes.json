And that are just two exaples before Episode 3 came out.\n\nI know, that is a highly critecised thing. But there where allways redconed Jedi that lived until or even after the OT. Doesn't even Lucas said, that there where at least 100 Jedi, that where alive at this time? Even in Episode 3 it was mentioned that remaining Jedi where warned.",
            "Imagine the amazing amount of content we would have missed out on if we listened to these types of complaints",

            "I sort of remember Ysard saying and/or thinking in one of the. Wing books that Palpatines belief he managed to kill all the jedi aka his biggest achievement was one of his biggest flaws due to his inflated ego. Bc there was no way the empire could have accomplished that.",
            "I like the current canon. Every single jedi who survived survived due to someone else helping them at some cost to themselves. \n\nCal Kestis had Jaro Tapal, Kanan had the Bad Batch, Obi-wan and Yoda had Bail Organa, the list goes on.",

            "Well we now know that Kanan and Ahsoka did, along with Obi Wan and Yoda to an extent\n\nOthers helped with the Hidden Path, like Quinlan, Cere, Cordova, Cal Kestis, etc \n\nOthers went dark like Baylan, Malicos, Bode - and all the inquisitors \n\nMany others like Gungi probably went into hiding. Makes sense.",
            "Actually around 200 survived and most joined the new Jedi Order in Legends. It\u2019s not really clear what happened to surviving Jedi in canon as most either die, disappear or turn to the dark side in canon",
            "I don't know of many, but the likes of Ram Kota and the father X1 and X2, but I can't remember the names or media the others were in\n\nBut most of the ones I remember were old human men. Little variety among them",

            "My favorite part is when the decided to bring Palpatine back just like in legends. Cloning and trying to possess people and everything. Cliffs Notes version of Dark Empire. I can see why they went the route they did with decanonizing the EU, but they chose the worst part to use in canon. Other than the Yuuzhan Vong. And Han Solo being heir to the throne of Corellia. And we probably could have done without George Lucas\u2019s sequel plans of microscope midiclorian adventures.",

What was the interview question asked when she gave this response? \n\n\u201c*Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow was slated to write and direct Episode IX before you brought J.J. Abrams back in. Is this final entry in the trilogy a particularly hard nut to crack?*\u201d\n\nHer answer is longer, but this includes what preceded it:\n\n\u201c*Every one of these movies is a particularly hard nut to crack. There\u2019s no source material. We don\u2019t have comic books. We don\u2019t have 800-page novels. We don\u2019t have anything other than passionate storytellers who get together and talk about what the next iteration might be.*\u201d\n\nWhile I think it could have been phrased better, her response is unquestionably correct. They were writing the third movie in the Sequel trilogy and the answer was specifically aimed at those movies, not SW as a whole as folks like to paint it. There was no \u201csource material\u201d to adapt as they were making a brand new story. The Sequels were never going to adapt any of the EU stories, even when Lucas was working on what became TFA prior to the sale, so they can only be used as inspiration and no directly adaptable source material. ROS even took direct inspiration from the EU and folks hated it for that.",

            "Yes because Star Wars really is known for never expanding at all. After Episode 4 they did not release Splinter of the Minds Eye, and Thrawn trilogy did not inspire George Lucas to finally make prequel trilogy. \n\nYou have to be incredibly ignorant or have literally no imagination to think that there is nothing that could be used to make Star Wars movies. They literally could just ignore ANYTHING they wanted and take EVERYTHING they wanted and make brilliant sequel trilogy that starts new bright era of canon.",

Could he predict the Bendu and the space whales? No. But just because he couldn't predict the specifics isn't a good excuse for him to lose; he should have had general contingencies for basically any part of his plan going wrong.\n\nThrawn, the biggest genius in all the Empire, decides that, in his ultimate plan to defeat the rebels, he will bring *two* interdictors.

Even TLJ didn't do a good job setting that up.\n\nTFA was really clearly setting up Snoke as the big bad. Kylo gets story and character development, Snoke gets mystery and far more power. Kylo loses fights; Snoke doesn't even show up in person. Clearly, the plan, as of the end of TFA, was for future movies to explore Snoke, and Kylo would be his henchman.\n\nIn TLJ, Snoke dies, but... it's just baffling. The entirety of TLJ is spent exploring Kylo Ren, not Snoke, and right before he dies, he uses a single hand to bend Rey backwards with the force. After his death, Kylo can't even beat Rey in force tug-of-war; heck, she even spares his life after waking up before him.\n\nThat means we replaced the unknown and mysterious villain who easily beats Rey with a far weaker one who has had basically all aspects of his character explored and lost to her twice. What could they even do with him in the final movie? Have him lose for the third time in a row? Explore all the nothing left to explore in his backstory?

The only thing it's guilty of is the dumb shit the actors and actresses said during interviews.\n\nBut if a birthdate is enough to break canon for you, I invite you to look at *all the other canon breaking stuff found throughout nearly all of Star Wars IIRC*.

Say he was a student of Luke's that was away from the new temple when it burned down, went merc after Luke disappeared, then runs into or is sought after by Rey to help her build up a new Jedi order. Plenty of room to work with that, could even have Jerec stand-in who was an old Knight of Ren or something",
            "I mean, I think that's what they are doing already though. Take Thrawn, in Legends he agreed to work with Sidious and the Empire to help prepare the galaxy to face the Vong. Obviously they've dropped the Vong, but introduced the Grisk (I think that's how it's spelled). However, you can't introduce Joruus Cbaoth from the same story arc because that undermines everything about how hard it is to clone Force sensitives. No Cbaoth means no significant plot point for the whole Thrawns trilogy, so you rewrite Thrawns backstory like they did. A lot of Legends is connected though so you can't just copy and paste a whole storyline without causing so many canon issues, you may as well rewrite or drop things completely. \n\nI think Star Wars is doing better than it was before the acquisition, and that won't change. I think there is an oversaturation of content that isn't always the best, but that's something Legends had in spades. The main difference is that it's on screen, making it more accessible to more people. Not many people read the Crystal Star, but I'd easily take any of the sequel movies over it.",

Johnson was also working directly with Abrams during the end stages of development of TFA. There\u2019s even at least one verifiable change to TFA that Johnson requested be made. \n\nDuel of the Fates *is* far more cohesive.

When Abrams was brought back in, nearly everything had to be thrown out the window and started again along a two year timeline when the movies needed three.

The Empire got wind of their plan and sent the 501st (now rechristened \"Vader's Fist\") to put down the rogue clones, kill the would-be fugitive cloners, and confiscate all of their technology.
