Utilities are then backfilling those purchases with fossil fuel expansions, regulatory filings show.\u201d\n\n___________\n\n\u201cAmong the region\u2019s mega energy users is Meta.

Other data center developers are frantically searching for power in the area.\nThe region was supposed to be a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d technology launchpad, with utility PacifiCorp declaring it would aim to replace coal infrastructure with next-generation small nuclear plants built by a company that Gates chairs.

The new emissions created would be comparable to that of putting 15.7 million additional gas-powered cars on the road.\u201d\n\n_____\n\n\n\u201cCritics charge the arrangements often fall short.\n\u201cIf data centers are claiming to be clean, but utilities are using their presence to justify adding more gas capacity, people should be skeptical of those claims,\u201d said Wilson Ricks, an energy systems researcher at Princeton University\u2019s Zero Lab, which focuses on decarbonization.\nOne example is an agreement announced in March, after Amazon signed a contract to buy more than a third of the electricity generated by one of the nation\u2019s largest nuclear facilities, the Susquehanna power plant in Luzerne County, Pa.\n\n\u201cThat deal disturbed a lot of people,\u201d Zubaty said. \u201cWhen massive data centers show up and start claiming the output of a nuclear plant, you basically have to replace that electricity with something else.\u201d\u201d\n\n________\n\n\u201cThe developer of the geothermal plant, Fervo Energy, credits Google with jump-starting a promising energy solution that some day might provide the electricity equivalent of multiple nuclear plants. But Fervo CEO Tim Lattimer acknowledges that kind of output is not likely until well into the 2030s.\n\nFervo\u2019s Nevada plant produces about the amount of power it takes to keep the lights on at a few thousand homes. The next Fervo plant, in Utah, is expected to be fully operational in 2028 and will generate roughly the amount of energy it takes to run one large data center.\u201d\n\n________\n\n\u201cBut there is deep skepticism in the scientific community that Helion or other fusion start-ups will be sending juice to the power grid within a decade, much less the kind of too-cheap-to-meter, safe electricity the tech companies are chasing.\n\u201cPredictions of commercial fusion by 2030 or 2035 are hype at this point,\u201d said John Holdren, a Harvard physicist who was White House science adviser during the Obama era. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even yet seen a true energy break-even where the fusion reaction is generating more energy than had to be supplied to facilitate it.\u201d\n\nPromises that commercial fusion is around the corner, he said, \u201cfeeds the public\u2019s belief in technological miracles that will save us from the difficult task of dealing with climate change \u2026 with the options that are closer to practical reality.\u201d\u201d",

            "Here is the entire article, since some people are having problems with the paywall. Still free on Apple News for time being:\n\nAI is exhausting the power grid. Tech firms are seeking a miracle solution.\n\nBy Evan Halper and Caroline O\u2019Donovan\nJune 21 at 5:00 AM\n\nAs power needs of AI push emissions up and put big tech in a bind, companies put their faith in elusive \u2014 some say improbable \u2014 technologies.\n\nThe mighty Columbia River has helped power the American West with hydroelectricity since the days of FDR\u2019s New Deal. But the artificial intelligence revolution will demand more. Much more.\n\nSo near the river\u2019s banks in Central Washington, Microsoft is betting on an effort to generate power from atomic fusion \u2014 the collision of atoms that powers the sun \u2014 a breakthrough that has eluded scientists for the past century. Physicists predict it will elude Microsoft, too.\n\nThe tech giant and its partners say they expect to harness fusion by 2028, an audacious claim that bolsters their promises to transition to green energy but distracts from current reality. In fact, the voracious electricity consumption of artificial intelligence is driving an expansion of fossil fuel use \u2014 including delaying the retirement of some coal-fired plants.\n\nIn the face of this dilemma, Big Tech is going all in on experimental clean-energy projects that have long odds of success anytime soon. In addition to fusion, they are hoping to generate power through such futuristic schemes as small nuclear reactors hooked to individual computing centers and machinery that taps geothermal energy by boring 10,000 feet into the Earth\u2019s crust.\n\nTech companies had promised \u201cclean energy would be this magical, infinite resource,\u201d said Tamara Kneese, a project director at the nonprofit Data & Society, which tracks the effect of AI and accuses the tech industry of using \u201cfuzzy math\u201d in its climate claims.\n\n\u201cCoal plants are being reinvigorated because of the AI boom,\u201d Kneese said. \u201cThis should be alarming to anyone who cares about the environment.\u201d\n\nPower Grab\n\nAs the tech giants compete in a global AI arms race, a frenzy of data center construction is sweeping the country. Some computing campuses require as much energy as a modest-sized city, turning tech firms that promised to lead the way into a clean energy future into some of the world\u2019s most insatiable guzzlers of power. Their projected energy needs are so huge, some worry whether there will be enough electricity to meet them from any source.\n\nData centers, the nondescript warehouses packed with racks of servers that power the modern internet, have been around for decades. But the amount of electricity they need now is soaring because of AI. Training artificial intelligence models and using AI to execute even simple tasks involves ever more complicated, faster and voluminous computations that are straining the electricity system.\n\nA ChatGPT-powered search, according to the International Energy Agency, consumes almost 10 times the amount of electricity as a search on Google. One large data center complex in Iowa owned by Meta burns the annual equivalent amount of power as 7 million laptops running eight hours every day, based on data shared publicly by the company.\n\nThe data-center-driven resurgence in fossil fuel power contrasts starkly with the sustainability commitments of tech giants Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta, all of which say they will erase their emissions entirely as soon as 2030. The companies are the most prominent players in a constellation of more than 2,700 data centers nationwide, many of them run by more obscure firms that rent out computing power to the tech giants.\n\n\u201cThey are starting to think like cement and chemical plants. The ones who have approached us are agnostic as to where the power is coming from,\u201d said Ganesh Sakshi, chief financial officer of Mountain V Oil & Gas, which provides natural gas to industrial customers in Eastern states.\n\nTech companies are confronting this dilemma with bravado. Artificial intelligence thinkers like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, a major backer of Microsoft\u2019s fusion start-up partner Helion, and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who invests big in other fusion efforts, say breakthroughs in energy are achievable.\n\nThe companies also argue advancing AI now could prove more beneficial to the environment than curbing electricity consumption. They say AI is already being harnessed to make the power grid smarter, speed up innovation of new nuclear technologies and track emissions.\n\nMicrosoft was the only one of the four major firms driving the AI boom to answer detailed questions from The Washington Post about their energy needs and plans. Google, Amazon and Meta offered limited statements.\n\n\u201cIf we work together, we can unlock AI\u2019s game-changing abilities to help create the net zero, climate resilient and nature positive works that we so urgently need,\u201d Microsoft said in a statement.\n\nThe tech giants say they buy enough wind, solar or geothermal power every time a big data center comes online to cancel out its emissions. But critics see a shell game with these contracts: The companies are operating off the same power grid as everyone else, while claiming for themselves much of the finite amount of green energy. Utilities are then backfilling those purchases with fossil fuel expansions, regulatory filings show.\n\nAmazon says it has been \u201cthe world\u2019s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy for four straight years.\u201d Google wrote that it is using AI \u201cto accelerate climate action,\u201d which is \u201cjust as crucial as solving for the environmental impact associated with it.\u201d\n\nAs for Microsoft, the company said that \u201cby 2030, we will have 100% of our electricity consumption, 100% of the time, matched by zero carbon energy purchases.\u201d\n\nLeft unmentioned are the heavily polluting fossil fuel plants that become necessary to stabilize the power grid overall because of these purchases, making sure everyone has enough electricity.",
            "AI generation is one of the most flexible loads imaginable in terms of power grid. When the price of electricity jumps unbearably high, the generation can either be delayed, or done on some other server in a different part of the world.  This is a very good sort of load to have on your grid.",
            "Lets also say that big tech is trying to cling to its zero emissions promise by 2030 buy buying all the available green energy in the grid, forcing emissions intensive energy production to continue to provide for the rest of the population.\n\nMuch talk about fusion with little promise of when it might happen.\n\n\"The companies also argue advancing AI now could prove more beneficial to the environment than curbing electricity consumption.\"\n\nTheres a statement that can just keep pushing the problem further into the future",

            "How much is carbon contributing to their grid? Would be great idea if a grid is overloaded with renewable or clean energy. But it seems to me that adding data centers to any grid that uses carbon is perpetuating the problem that most of us want to end (emissions, fossil fuels, drilling). \n\nPersonally, I am for more nuclear power. Not sure I like the idea of mini-nuclear reactors powering data centers though. Seems risky.",

            "A typical adult is expected to consume 2500 kcalories a day.  That converts to around 121 watts.  We can't subtract all of the activity that goes into maintaining the brain, like breathing, or maintaining a healthy blood ph, or removing water soluble waste products withour kidneys. That's my opinion, anyway.\n\nBut either way,  a professional writer (which encompasses a bunch of jobs, but lets say novelist, editorial writer, screenwriter, etc) will shoot for 500-1000 words a day.  If that writer lives alone, and lives a solitary life, and we've never met them personally,  we can \"abstract\" away that job, and we can think of them as \"Writing Machine A\".  Writing Machine A works 9 hours a day. For 2500 Calories a day, and lets say...$300 a day, we get two pages.  We have to wait all day for a finished product.\n\nGPT4 consumes 3.6 - 36 kjoules per prompt.   1 kilojoule is \\~ 0.25 KCalorie.  So for one VERY intense prompt (I'm using the upper limit - 36 kj), we've consumed 8.6 kCalories.  Is my math wrong?   It seems like gpt4 is way more efficient than a human.  And that human is probably driving 20 miles a day, generating trash, has to brush their teeth, and everything else.   Humans consume way less net energy, metabolically.   For certain  tasks, it seems like that is a bottleneck - not necessarily a virtue, and for \"normal\" writing tasks, gpt4 consumes less power by a long shot compared to a human.\n\n  \nI realize there are tons of variables in this comparison, so feel free to pick it apart",
            "But the brain is fundamentally different to what we want from LLMs anyway. Take for example, our brain\u2019s tendency to quickly forget things. Or the tendency to only be able to process information at low speeds (compared to computers). \n\nAll of these limitations may contribute to the brains low power requirements. But we expect AI to be capable of so many things that the human brain couldn\u2019t fathom or comprehend. Which might make AI more power demanding than the human brain will ever be. It\u2019s a false assumption to automatically assume that just because the brain requires so little power, that AI will automatically be the same.",
            "To your last point, what worries me\u2014and is suggested in the article\u2014is that by taking up more and more space on the non-carbon grid (ie. Amazon buying 1/3rd of the supply from one of the nation\u2019s biggest nuclear plants), they are pushing us normal people back onto coal and gas, and presumably we are going to bear the cost of the inevitable price increase, not Amazon (or Microsoft, or OpenAI, or Meta, or Anthropic, etc).",
            "This might be an unpopular opinion with the anti-regulation people, but I think it would be nice if the US corps would accept EU regulations and work out a way to run data centers in countries that have grid capacity for them (for now). Even better would be if the US government facilitates this and takes the opportunity to regulate our own power grid better, while strengthening economic and technological ties to Europe.",

            "In the Salt Lake City region, utility executives and lawmakers scaled back plans for big investments in clean energy and doubled down on coal. The retirement of a large coal plant has been pushed back a decade, to 2042, and the closure of another has been delayed to 2036.\n\nAmong the region\u2019s mega energy users is Meta. It\u2019s building a $1.5 billion data center campus outside Salt Lake City that consumes as much power as can be generated by a large nuclear reactor. Google has purchased 300 acres across the street from Meta\u2019s data center and plans its own data center campus.

But that plan was put on the shelf when PacifiCorp announced in April that it will prolong coal burning, citing regulatory developments that make it viable.\n\n\u201cThis is very quickly becoming an issue of, don\u2019t get left behind locking down the power you need, and you can figure out the climate issues later,\u201d said Aaron Zubaty, CEO of California-based Eolian, a major developer of clean energy projects. \u201cAbility to find power right now will determine the winners and losers in the AI arms race. It has left us with a map bleeding with places where the retirement of fossil plants are being delayed.\u201d\n\nA spike in tech-related energy needs in Georgia moved regulators in April to green-light an expansion of fossil fuel use, including purchasing power from Mississippi that will delay closure of a half-century-old coal plant there. In the suburbs of Milwaukee, Microsoft\u2019s announcement in March that it is building a $3.3 billion data center campus followed the local utility pushing back by one year the retirement of coal units, and unveiling plans for a vast expansion of gas power that regional energy executives say is necessary to stabilize the grid amid soaring data center demand and other growth.\n\nIn Omaha, where Google and Meta recently set up sprawling data center operations, a coal plant that was supposed to go offline in 2022 will now be operational through at least 2026. The local utility has scrapped plans to install large batteries to store solar power.\n\nThese concrete developments in energy markets contrast with tech companies\u2019 futuristic promises. A recent Goldman Sachs analysis of energy that will power the AI boom into 2030 did not even consider small nuclear plants or futuristic fusion generators.\nIt found data centers will account for 8 percent of total electricity use in the United States by 2030, a near tripling of their share today. New solar and wind energy will meet about 40 percent of that new power demand from data centers, the forecast said, while the rest will come from a vast expansion in the burning of natural gas. The new emissions created would be comparable to that of putting 15.7 million additional gas-powered cars on the road.\n\n\u201cWe all want to be cleaner,\u201d Brian Bird, president of NorthWestern Energy, a utility serving Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska, told a recent gathering of data center executives in Washington, D.C. \u201cBut you guys aren\u2019t going to wait 10 years \u2026 My only choice today, other than keeping coal plants open longer than all of us want, is natural gas.

            "One example is an agreement announced in March, after Amazon signed a contract to buy more than a third of the electricity generated by one of the nation\u2019s largest nuclear facilities, the Susquehanna power plant in Luzerne County, Pa.\n\n\u201cThat deal disturbed a lot of people,\u201d Zubaty said. \u201cWhen massive data centers show up and start claiming the output of a nuclear plant, you basically have to replace that electricity with something else.\u201d\nTech companies acknowledge big new sources of clean power need to be found. At the World Economic Forum conference in Davos, Switzerland in January, Altman said at a Bloomberg event that, when it comes to finding enough energy to fuel expected AI growth, \u201cthere is no way to get there without a breakthrough.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear where, or when, those breakthroughs will arrive. Google recently powered up a futuristic geothermal power plant in the northern Nevada desert that harnesses heat from deep underground.\n\nThe developer of the geothermal plant, Fervo Energy, credits Google with jump-starting a promising energy solution that some day might provide the electricity equivalent of multiple nuclear plants. But Fervo CEO Tim Lattimer acknowledges that kind of output is not likely until well into the 2030s.\n\nFervo\u2019s Nevada plant produces about the amount of power it takes to keep the lights on at a few thousand homes. The next Fervo plant, in Utah, is expected to be fully operational in 2028 and will generate roughly the amount of energy it takes to run one large data center.\n\nAltman, meanwhile, is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to develop small nuclear plants that could be built right on or near data center campuses. Altman\u2019s AltC Acquisition Corp. bankrolled a company Altman now chairs called Oklo, which says it wants to build the first such plant by 2027.\n\nGates is the founder of his own nuclear company, called TerraPower. It has targeted a former coal mine in Wyoming to be the demonstration site of an advanced reactor that proponents claim would deliver energy more efficiently and with less waste than traditional reactors. The project has been saddled with setbacks, most recently because the type of enriched uranium needed to fuel its reactor is not available in the United States.\n\nSome experts point to these developments in arguing the electricity needs of the tech companies will speed up the energy transition away from fossil fuels rather than undermine it.\n\n\u201cCompanies like this that make aggressive climate commitments have historically accelerated deployment of clean electricity,\u201d said Melissa Lott, a professor at the Climate School at Columbia University.\n\nMicrosoft hopes to supercharge that deployment through its partnership with fusion start-up Helion. The site being considered for the generator in Chelan County, Wash., is just a plot of sagebrush so far. It\u2019s not certain the unit will be built.\n\nFor now, Helion is building and testing prototypes at its headquarters in Everett, Wash. Scientists have been chasing the fusion dream for decades but have yet to overcome the extraordinary technical challenges. It requires capturing the energy created by fusing atoms in a magnetic chamber \u2014 or in Helion\u2019s case, a magnetized vacuum chamber \u2014 and then channeling that energy into a usable form. And to make it commercially viable, more energy must be produced than is put in.\n\nHelion\u2019s assembly facility features floor-to-ceiling shelves stacked with endless boxes of capacitors, aluminum-coated devices that store energy, some of which Helion employees spend hours a day assembling by hand. The floors and walls are stark white. Massive, sea-foam green fusion generator components dot the factory floor.\n\nA sense of optimism infuses the experimental work. \u201cI know it can make electricity,\u201d said Helion CEO David Kirtley. \u201cThe question is, can we take that electricity out of fusion and do it such that the cost of electricity is lower than everything else.\u201d\n\nOn a video screen in the space where Helion is building its control room is a live feed from a camera in a neighboring warehouse where the seventh Helion prototype, Polaris, will be tested. It is surrounded by borated concrete walls that block neutrons from escaping.\nHelion, among several fusion start-ups, uses helium-3, a molecule that is rare on Earth but abundant on the moon. Kirtley says the company\u2019s process actually generates more of the molecule as a byproduct, creating fuel to make yet more fusion electricity.\n\nBut there is deep skepticism in the scientific community that Helion or other fusion start-ups will be sending juice to the power grid within a decade, much less the kind of too-cheap-to-meter, safe electricity the tech companies are chasing.\n\n\u201cPredictions of commercial fusion by 2030 or 2035 are hype at this point,\u201d said John Holdren, a Harvard physicist who was White House science adviser during the Obama era. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even yet seen a true energy break-even where the fusion reaction is generating more energy than had to be supplied to facilitate it.\u201d\n\nPromises that commercial fusion is around the corner, he said, \u201cfeeds the public\u2019s belief in technological miracles that will save us from the difficult task of dealing with climate change \u2026 with the options that are closer to practical reality.\u201d\n\nBut Chelan County, known for its apple orchards and abundant hydro power, has another problem. While there is enough hydropower generated there to send electricity throughout the West Coast, most of it has already been claimed decades into the future. In their quest to sustain the data center boom fueled by Microsoft and its competitors, county planners are hopeful Helion will actually beat the odds and start sending electricity to the region\u2019s power grid, which Microsoft would then purchase.\n\nHelion has raised expectations with assurances that its contract with Microsoft is binding, and it will have to pay serious financial penalties to the tech giant if it does not quickly create fusion electricity. But pressed for the particulars of the contract, Kirtley responds with a measure of opacity that is typical among tech leaders chasing historic clean-energy breakthroughs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re past the details I can talk publicly about,\u201d he said.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized an International Energy Agency study of energy use for internet searches powered by artificial intelligence. The IEA compared Google searches with searches performed by ChatGPT, the AI chatbot, not a \"ChatGPT-powered search on Google.\" The article also gave an incorrect location for the headquarters of energy firm Eolian. The company is based in California not Texas. This article has been corrected.\n\nEvan Halper is a business reporter for The Washington Post, covering the energy transition. His work focuses on the tensions between energy demands and decarbonizing the economy. He came to The Post from the Los Angeles Times, where he spent two decades, most recently covering domestic policy and presidential politics from its Washington bureau.\nCaroline O'Donovan covers Amazon for the tech team.

            "That's technical availability requirement, nobody says the hardware has to be used at full power if the price is unfavorable. When the energy market puts a fuck off price on power and that price gets passed to customers, then the customers can choose to run their workloads some other time or at some other place. And it's no big fuss, software is globally portable in seconds, you can go where the price is right.",
            "You are mis-reading the take. It\u2019s not that green energy is bad, it is that it isn\u2019t enough to power the US power grid and is not enough to offset the increasing carbon emissions that occurs when these companies buy up the green energy output. When they do that, the rest of us are pushed back to coal and gas. \n\nNo signs are pointing to this situation improving by 2030, when it\u2019s estimated that data centers will take up 8% of the grid (which is a HUGE amount). We are on borrowed time at the moment. \n\nIt\u2019s quite clearly stated in the Post article and not difficult to understand.\n\n\nEdit: u/West_Drop_9193 blocked me rather than using their brain.",
            "No where, and I really mean this, no where on earth can a person or company just throw up a DIY nuclear reactor. It\u2019s be prison for everyone lol.\n\nSmall nuclear reactors are already in use onboard subs and aircraft carriers. You don\u2019t see a lot of them on land for the reason you suggested: the use case is completely different and would serve a lot more demand than the smaller ones, not to mention no company wants to invest tens of millions of dollars before they even break ground on a reactor that isn\u2019t going to provide a sizable ROI, which is why they typically go very big - more electrical output for the same upfront investment. \n\nThis specific use case, though, is a perfect one for a small reactor. Removing these data centers from the rest of the grid would _substantially_ reduce demand on the grid. Having a grid connected reactor just near the data center doesn\u2019t solve the core problem at all.",
            "So far, SMRs are the most expensive to build (per MW), face huge delays and difficulties, arent nearly as cheap and low maintenance to run, and the ones that make power now are doing so with jacked up mwh prices 2-3x initial estimates.",

            "Generative AI is not going to solve the energy grid. These corps are building data centers to train and run LLMs. Maybe you have some hope that some super AI is going to emerge before we fly past 2 degrees Celsius, but I don\u2019t have that kind of blind faith in technology. I am skeptical.",
            "I was thinking the same thing, probably an algorithm that locks up anything that gets a certain amount of hits fast, possibly even traffic from specific sites like Reddit. \n\nI have had this happen to me before, actually.",
            "I think you're thinking all of this this in way too simple terms. You said it yourself generative AI is some sort of massive \"gamble\". But actually, LLMs are already useful in materials discovery such as with the Gnome model, this btw is very important to improve renewables tech. They've also already lead to a matrix multiplication breakthrough, which in turn makes computation more energy efficient, sorts of computations that are used everywhere, not just in generative AI. Generative AIs in general help productivity efficiency, I use them and it definitely has helped me as a programmer, and that in and of itself DOES impact energy usage in the end, given all the inevitable needs that our global growing civilization has. Let's not forget energy is not the only issue in life anyways, so we could go on on stuff like solving protein folding and medicine as well.\n\nThe list of contributions it has goes on and on, and really no one has the breadth of knowledge to understand the collective contribution generative AIs are already making in technological progress and productivity efficiency. Not to mention, I indulged you in narrowing down to \"generative AI\", but it's also incredibly ridiculous to think that's the only type of AI data centers can help create. And also, all of this is what AI already does, RIGHT NOW. The data is very conclusive that they will only get much better with scale, not only better at what they already do, but also have new emergent capabilities like they've already had. We see it both happening moment by moment and have factual evidence to know it will keep doing so. So to call all this a \"fantasy\", and to frame it as if the only useful thing AIs could do is be some sort of \"big gamble\" for fusion is just... I can't find the words to describe how ignorant it is. It is helpful and increasingly more so all along the way to making some massive breakthroughs like fusion which yes it WILL eventually lead to without any doubt. And no it's not like it will \"solve\" fusion all of a sudden one day, it's all of the help in solving otherwise very difficult or unsolvable problems (which like I said it already has in fusion specifically, which by itself proves my point) that will make it an indispensable associate to it.\n\nThere is much more to go on here, but the point is the impact of AI is MUCH more complex than some simple-minded framing of it just doing nothing less than adding pressure to power grids for some big fusion gamble."

If artists lose their jobs to AI art, it's entirely plausible, and with AI where it is now even likely, that as a culture, over the long run, we end up with less art and less quality art. That's the risk, if we don't have human artists who are fed, clothed, and sheltered so that they can continue to produce and culturally evolve art, because AI as it is at the moment isn't capable of cultural evolution of art. It's constrained by its training data. We risk walking into cultural stagnation with a culture that doesn't feed and shelter its artists.",

But here's the thing: humans are just as dependent on the environment for our intelligence. When we \"discover\" things, we're really just converting experiences into reusable ideas and sharing them.\n\nNo human could individually rediscover all that humanity has figured out. Our culture, our knowledge - it's not just about brains. It's the result of this massive diversity of approaches and world-grounding that human society has accumulated over history.\nAI needs physical and social grounding, just like we do. Intelligence evolves socially - no human or AI is smart enough individually to do it all. We need that real-world feedback loop, that constant interaction with the environment and society.\n\nSo what's likely to happen? A diversification of activities using a combo of humans and AI. We'll keep everyone busy because we're always coming up with new goals, new desires. We never reached the end of human ambition just because we automated something.\n\nIf you think GPUs alone could evolve by just crunching numbers, remember our particle accelerators and space telescopes - they provide real-world feedback to scientific theories. We have no lack of ideas, but figuring out which ones will pan out? That's the tricky part.\n\nAI might help with coming up with ideas, but it'll be just as stumped as we are when it comes to testing them in the real world. Think about that. All we know comes from the environment and society, not just our brains. The brain just adds a drop of novel insight or stumbles on a new outcome and reports it back to the hive mind. That's how we move forward. There is no direct path to super-intelligence that avoids the world and social/cultural evolution. AGI will appear at civilization scale, not in singletons.",

It won't get truly different or 'better', until we feed it with more examples of human artists who do. That's the point.\n\nAI art doesn't evolve culturally. Not yet. Because it doesn't evolve or produce art inspired from outside the parameters of its training data, which is art that already exists. That's the issue. Maybe humans don't produce art outside of the parameters of *their* training data either, but the training data human beings are trained on is vastly more varied and complex, involving all of life experience that an embodied conscious agent can draw on to create. This is why human art evolves, and artistic  movements inter-relate to historical moments and change, because all that inspiration continually changes. The limit of possible human experience that a human artist can draw on to create its art is almost endless, unlike the finite limit of current AI experience it draws on in creating its art.\n\nMaybe we'll have AI that can produce art like humans one day, but we don't have it now, and until we do we should be careful about cultural shifts that rely too much on the AI art we do have, confusing its novel recombination of existing culture as genuine novelty, while killing off the human artists who produce the actual 'stuff' that gives culture its variety.",

A replication rate of nearly 0% in a set biased in favor of overfitting using the exact same labels as the training data and specifically targeting images they knew were duplicated many times in the dataset using a smaller model of Stable Diffusion (890 million parameters vs. the larger 2 billion parameter Stable Diffusion 3 releasing on June 12). This attack also relied on having access to the original training image labels:\n\n\u201cInstead, we first embed each image to a 512 dimensional vector using CLIP [54], and then perform the all-pairs comparison between images in this lower-dimensional space (increasing efficiency by over 1500\u00d7). We count two examples as near-duplicates if their CLIP embeddings have a high cosine similarity. For each of these near-duplicated images, we use the corresponding captions as the input to our extraction attack.\u201d\n\nThere is not as of yet evidence that this attack is replicable without knowing the image you are targeting beforehand. So the attack does not work as a valid method of privacy invasion so much as a method of determining if training occurred on the work in question - and only for images with a high rate of duplication, and still found almost NONE.\n\n\u201cOn Imagen, we attempted extraction of the 500 images with the highest out-ofdistribution score. Imagen memorized and regurgitated 3 of these images (which were unique in the training dataset). In contrast, we failed to identify any memorization when applying the same methodology to Stable Diffusion\u2014even after attempting to extract the 10,000 most-outlier samples\u201d\n\n\nI do not consider this rate or method of extraction to be an indication of duplication that would border on the realm of infringement, and this seems to be well within a reasonable level of control over infringement.\n\nDiffusion models can create human faces even when 90% of the pixels are removed in the training data https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19256\n\u00a0\n\u201cif we corrupt the images by deleting 80% of the pixels prior to training and finetune, the memorization decreases sharply and there are distinct differences between the generated images and their nearest neighbors from the dataset. This is in spite of finetuning until convergence.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs shown, the generations become slightly worse as we increase the level of corruption, but we can reasonably well learn the distribution even with 93% pixels missing (on average) from each training image.\u201d\n\nSo you think AI art is art if they are given more high quality data to train on?
