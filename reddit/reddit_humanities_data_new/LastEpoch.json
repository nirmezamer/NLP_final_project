            "I\u2019m from the future. Harbingers summon minions from portals that drop tiny ass shards. There\u2019s this cool new currency item that \u201cfractures\u201d an affix.",
            "is that Omega Weapon?",
            "Hype! Give us some more details!",
            "1.4  July 9th  2026 pog",
            "Finally, time to come back to the game for a new cycle. So hype!",
            "Uggghhhhh but Dawntrail comes out June 28.....",
            "Guess I was correct in my assumption that cycle 1 would be longer than four months... More time for more items, I approve.",
            "Very hype!\n\nWith a new cycle update, does that mean everything resets fresh like a Diablo/POE season and all current progress moves over to the core servers?",
            "HYPE!",
            "Oh shit that\u2019s my birthday let\u2019s fucking goooo",
            "Oh thank god it doesn't overlap too heavily with Elden Ring's DLC.\n\nHYYYYPEE\n\nEdit: omg, people complaining about the development time lmao.  Have you never watched a small studio grow before?  These devs have genuine passion and actually possess the ability to innovate, give them some fuckin time to cook, Jesus.",
            "The day after my birthday!",
            "Is this cycle 2 in guessing?",
            "What are Pikachu and Snorlax from Dark Souls 1 doing in the Trailer?",
            "2 more months!",
            "Harbinger league!!! Wohooo\u2026 wait wrong game",
            "I am SO excited for this, excited for the team. This game has some of the most amazing bones and just an incredible base. The devs actually listen to the community and COMMUNICATE with us. \n\nCheers to EHG.",
            "So.. I love the game and the new season looks ok, yet the servers are crap, have bosses do invisible attacks, 3+ party members get 1 of the kicked, server and input lag makes dash skills unusable, Speaking of dash, running charge skills randomly stop or instantly stop.. i mean I can go on. \n\nI might install if the game gets some love, but as of right now, hard pass.",
            "Should be a good cycle \ud83d\udd01",
            "Let\u2019s go! Super hyped for this!!",
            "Let\u2019s goooooo",
            "So my summer will be Elden Ring DLC then Last Epoch 1.1, life is good.",
            "That seems dangerously close to around when the next poe league launches. I know you can only work around other games schedules so much, but you do share a large portion of the same audience",
            "If cycle 1 was going to be this long, I feel we really need a patch 1.1b with just rebalances and no new content.",
            "Was expecting a new league in a couple weeks from now lol\n\nWell, I'll prob come back after they launch a few new cycles back to back so there is stuff to do in the endgame. It's gonna take more than 1-2 new cycles to make monoliths where they need to be.",
            "I thought it will be next month. Dammmn have to wait more",
            "2 fucking months....",
            "Okay, so tell us about the cycle. Is there going to be a new dedicated mechanic that we can look forward to?",
            "I am not sure 9 weeks of teasers will do my brain any good with all the drip....  \nWe are getting 9 weeks of teasers, right ;p",
            "i don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough to make the game less repetitive",
            "That's... A fair bit longer than the 3-4 month cycles EHG said they'd be running with. I would have preferred a much shorter first cycle with a cut-down second cycle that gets some of the big improvements out of the way (ward, some of the worst masteries, DoT mitigation being ass) and then the third cycle be where we really get into the beefy stuff. Like I would have gone with a \\*faster\\* than 3 month first cycle just to really get the big fixes out that launch showed the game needs, then a normal length 2nd cycle.",
            "9th of July is pretty late considering they wanted a release range within 3 - 4 months",
            "Excited for it. Looks cool but gotta say the purple mixed with hands bursting out of the ground looks a lot like POE\u2019s Breach theme.",
            "hype",
            "Is this a new cycle or a mini-event?",
            "9th July... I hope it is going to be a banger for that midcyle time",
            "HYPE! Can't wait to see what this cycle is!!!",
            "Any update on Steam achievements and if they\u2019ll be coming along with this new cycle?",
            "Holy waiting, Batman.",
            "I'm lost, what is this? A dlc? An expansion? An update? A new class? New map? What is is it lol, the teaser literally gave me no idea of what I should even be hyped for",
            "Underwhelming teaser! Give us more!\n\nI hope there is idea for a market and a new/more currency too pls",
            "[removed]",
            "ok",
            "man july 9 so far away, the release was february so 5 month a cycle ?",
            "Cant wait. Its far away tho... Kinda sad.",
            "I will not be coming back without some serious class tuning like buffing Forge guard\u2026",
            "Did EHG team wanna this league only can play 1month? When PoE new lg will starting at August then EHG think they can live with PoE???",
            "This is giving me a huge Harbinger!",
            "I hope the next cycles don't take 5 months to come out... 1.1 should be coming out end of May, not July",
            "Kind of late but better than middle of June when Elden Ring DLC drops.\n\nSo, it will be kind of like a little less than 2 months from D4 season 4. When is PoE next league coming in? August?",
            "For you when ruin came to your world it was the most important day of your life. For Eterra. It was Tuesday.",
            "Dawn trail comes out right before this and this also is probably right around the Poe league launch maybe a bit before so probably gonna have to skip this one or just play it later on",
            "The EHG team deserves a lot of credit for the outstanding quality of their recent trailers. The launch trailer did a great job of showing what makes the game fun. It was punchy, it emphasized gameplay, the writing was engaging, and the whole thing looked professional.\n\nLooking forward to the full trailer for this Cycle.",
            "Awesome, wasn't expecting this so early!",
            "Is it possible to fix the Lost Connections issue. It isn\u2019t my drivers or network connection. Please.",
            "Fucking finally.  So stoked to play this game again",
            "Fucking hyped. I know it's wrong to approach it like this but fuck it, i'm hyped.",
            "And then they will kill the league by not doing anything about exploits \ud83d\ude43",
            "Terrible timing as always\n\nYou guys really need to hire more ppl",
            "damn 2 months later, way too late.",
            "July 9th?  I'm assuming that will be the start of season three, because this is a literal joke if it isn't.",
            "You mean it seals the affix, totally different",
            "And they have this weird alien-korean hybrid names!",
            "I\u2019m also from the future. Many people will misspell and mispronounce Harbinger as Harbringer.",
            ">Harbingers summon minions from portals that drop tiny ass \n\nso disappointing\n\n^(/s)",
            "Go home exile, you're drunk!",
            "You\u2019re from a very far off future it seems, \u201cfracturing\u201d was what they learned to do a long time after they d-dayed on the Beach.",
            "And it provide huge exp after drop dead",
            "But these ones.. will be purple.",
            "Your account has been around for too long to be a EHG plant",
            "Tiny ass shards sounds painfully.  Can you imagine a T6 ass shard??",
            "But we already have a fracture mechanic \u2639\ufe0f",
            "Oh god",
            "What it does is makes you drop all your gear and self delete.. really awesome feature.. I feel might be some push back.. well one me thing.. gives you cancer-AIDS\u2026 but it\u2019s really awesome \ud83d\ude0e",
            "Was gonna say the same",
            "Looks more like ultima weapon",
            "More details will be coming when we push out the full launch trailer!",
            "Please don't give us details all at once. We hate that and prefer to be drip fed info. Hell, make a whole week out of it.\u00a0",
            "Nice and 1 year after that Poe 2 releases \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc13",
            "Yeah I was kinda thinking we might be early next year with 1.4. But if every season is gonna be 5 months or about I'm gonna look like gandalf the grey before we get 1.4. Still hype tho, hopefully they can stick to 3 months after this.",
            "Yeah, this summer is packed",
            "Fuck, yeah this is going to be a \u201crough\u201d summer.",
            "Also, somewhere around this time, a new season of PoE might start.",
            "Yeah not great timing but then again, It's still over a week away. I'd be curious how many players of last epoch who also plays ff14",
            "Lmao came here to say this. As much as I love Epoch, ffxiv is #1 in my book so I'll be going hard on Dawntrail.",
            "Yep :-( Last Epoch will take a back seat for this season.",
            "Yes, they mentioned that on their recent forum post.",
            "Yes",
            "Happy upcoming 12th birthday big guy. I hope you get a lot of cake, vbucks and get to do the griddy with your \"bruhs\"",
            "??? They are not small anymore since like 2years back. They now have around 50+ people now with ~40 by 2020. \nPeople white knighting this game are something",
            "None of this will ever get fixed. They will continue to ignore issues to push new content. That is how these devs are.",
            "It seems literally impossible to pick a \"good\" release date, at least from the perspective of people on reddit. There's people complaining about it coming out 3 weeks before a FF14 release and Elden Ring DLC. If you can't be within 3 weeks of a DLC for a different genre of game, there's nothing \"good\" you can pick.\n\nNot to mention that updates and releases get delayed or rescheduled all the time. You can't bank entirely on other companies release dates. At some point you just have to do what makes sense for your development team and timeline, not the tentative timeline of 15 other games and companies",
            "Yep. Releasing within a 2-3 week window of the poe league is just asking for less players.",
            "Give it time. It'll smooth out. This is their first game and first cycle.",
            "No, why would you think that? They have clearly stated that the first 4 cycles are going to be padding out the game, and not \"seasonal\" cycles like other games.",
            "i would rather have them get everything right and polished and take some more time and not rush it",
            "It'll probably be a few cycles before they really get the timing down. \n\nI imagine there's a lot of work still going on to prep for the next wave of players so they don't repeat days 1-3 of the game's launch.",
            "Yeah, unfortunately...",
            "Yeah holy shite. My thought exactly. I literally thought yesterday, new season has to be soon\u2026 they need to hire more developers or just do resets every 3 months. Especially after the gold exploit",
            "Next season, pinnacle bosses",
            "Be more civil with your discourse.  Also, it's a Tuesday, not Sunday.",
            "At the end of the day they\u2019re still a small development team. It makes sense it took a bit specially due to their initial problems with servers and all the real-life balancing they had to do.",
            "Rather 5 months and great cycle than 3 months and dog shit cycle. It's their first game. It's good they're taking it slow.",
            "IIRC D3 Season 1 was something like 5 or 6 months (or at least that\u2019s what it felt like)\n\nSeems reasonable for being the first season imo",
            "1 months and 2 week at least, until ggg fix all the bug and stupidly imbalanced stuff :D",
            "Next POE season not announced yet, but the pattern they have had recently would be at some point in July probably towards the middle/end of it.",

            "moonrunes",
            "Rouge",
            "I'm from the present.  This is at least an interesting mispronunciation, since it does still capture the meaning of the word.",
            "Dude you blowed my mind. I was in the same exact state watching the WoW trailer and listening \"Harbringer\" pronounced as the actual \"Harbinger\" and couldn't understand why they pronounced it that way... \n\nThanks a lot!! hahahahahhaha",
            "If you combine them the ass gets buffed.",
            "But im on the toilet and need details to read right now!",
            "You tease",
            "But I want it now \ud83d\ude2d",
            "well, hype achieved.. looks awesome!",
            "Can you at least give us a cryptic hint so long as you don't troll us with a cryptic message that means \" new content\" lol. :)",
            "full launch trailer!  \nIn...2 months? Surely people would rather have small teasers little by little instead.",
            "I honestly don\u2019t know who we will survive? Maybe one of those hot pocket warmers that attach to the side of our monitors. May be our only legit chance for survival!",
            "PoE has been going with 4 months season.  If they drop a season in July it would be at the end of the month.",
            "I read some speculation that it might be delayed. Otherwise, you are correct. \n\nHowever, I wouldn't mind having more arpg games to play, I expected to play the current PoE season to be better but it isn't...",
            "Realistically the most hardcore players only play a season for a couple weeks before they are done. Those will have dropped off by the time POE drops their next one. It'll be casual and those of us who prefer LE to POE by that point.",
            "it's going to be impossible to pick a date without some sort PoE/Diablo/Lost Ark/FF14/Elden Ring thing happening within a week or 2 of it.",
            "> I'd be curious how many players of last epoch who also plays ff14\n\ngreetings",
            "I doubt a lot. LE should be more focused on timing cycles so they don\u2019t match up with D4 and POE",
            "i quit ff14 and poe last year.",
            "Oh, il have to give that a read this afternoon. Thanks!",
            "Awesome, thanks :) Even more excited now!",
            "What is wrong with you?",
            "\ud83e\udd21",
            "\u201c50+\u201d for a live service game is still a really modest amount of people. Not sure what\u2019s so hard to understand about that.",
            "Thats a damn shame",
            "Yea complaining about other genres is ridiculous, there\u2019s always conflicts if you go that far. But conflicting with the other big games in the genre is different imo. Like I almost exclusively play arpgs. I really want to play the next cycle, but I haven\u2019t missed playing a path of exile league launch in years. If Poe comes out a week or 2 after last epoch does, a significant amount of people will drop to jump over to Poe\n\nSome of it is out of their control like you said. But this is the first real cycle and I think it would be a shame to have something like that happen so soon",
            "considering how bad last poe league was, poe probably could lose some player too",
            "I have absolutely no issue with them taking the time with new content and features, especially given it is free. I just don't think its a good idea to leave the meta in its current unbalance state for such a long time. In any case it too late for a cycle 1b, but perhaps in future it could be considered if such a situation arises.",
            "I don't think that, that's why I **asked about it.**",
            "yeah i dont mind them taking 5-6 months to get in the habit of cycles then lowering the time to 3-4 months as they become proficient in it",
            "I\u2019m sure they are trying but it\u2019s not easy hiring for specific roles. We\u2019ve been trying to find a single senior engineer for our tech stack for like 4 months now. And it\u2019s not for lack of pay or job toxicity, we\u2019ve been in top 5 places to work in our state for years now.",
            "I know that, but I do expect that we will still have server issues for the 1.1. and if 1.2 is again in 5 month after this one, I don't know if people will play LE for that long. but that just my 2 cents I hope i'm wrong",
            "Siriously?",
            "They bring har?",
            "> hahahahahhaha\n\nFor sure you mean harharharharhar",

            "Me too! Make something up!",
            "Honest question are you an actual LeFlop fan? Why as of July? The debate of MJ or Bron is one of the most laughable questions. I think the majority of bball fans don't even entertain the question anymore. Not hating, just asking :)",
            "This",
            "Same! \ud83d\udca9",

            "Salutations",
            "because 50 people is not a small team. How hard is it to understand to give them credit where credit is due and stop crawling into their corp ass. They do not care about you, they only care about your money. Stop being a bitch and hold them accountable for this slow ass schedule. I don\u00b4t fkng care about their goodwill, i and many others paid money, some even multiple years back. EHG launched a full on 1.0 game with the promise of content soon after. 0 balancing was done after the games launch with a shit meta and shit balance state. in a live service game. That is not ok. The servers shitting the bed was expected, bugs being here was also expected, but getting no content and updates for months after the 1.0 launch was not expected. They reassure you \"we are working on stuff\" constantly, but where is it? Not here. Its shit.",
            "The only league I quit sooner than this ass crypt league was Heist.",
            "People quit le just as fast. 3 weeks are fine",
            "They already said they are aiming for 4 cycles per year so it won't be that bad.",
            "They did just expand the development team and the benefits of that for timing will be felt starting next cycle I imagine, certainly for 1.3. Benefit being a more expected 3-4 months between cycles and more polished content. Takes time to bring people on board and get them up to speed.",
            "There are so many games coming out, I'd rather have an amazing season take 6 months than a semi decent season take 3 months.",
            "Makes sense for new content etc, but will they really leave CoF in this state for 2 other months and MG economy the day it is ?? No way to farm boss drops with CoF, etc.\n\nAlso the only thing that keeps me engaged : rolling new chars is made extremely boring by having to regrind monos, I dont mind doing the story for passive pts and idol slots, its varied at least, but monos grinding are a pain, especially when you dont meet any difficulty until 300/400cor..",
            "I\u2019m sure they have. Epoch probably made a lot more money than they expected. But excuses aside people won\u2019t stay engaged with 5 months seasons. Change the policy of doing resets only when something big drops. Make a large patch with balancing 2.5 months in or something",
            "I\u2019ll be back every season for years.",

            "The guy who replied you is right about the problems this current PoE league has, but they dont really matter to new / casual players so if you arent tired of the base game yet its still a decent league. Hell, I got 7 days played but I'm still having a blast.",

            "If you're this pent-up and disappointed about the game, it's more healthy for you to be doing something better with your time than spending time here. If you genuinely believe the game is not going to develop/improve in a way that you want it you, you really should just leave it be. Yeah, you've spent money on the game, so of course you're going to want to have a say in it, but it sounds like you're stuck in a sunk-cost rut. Just bail if it's that distressing, legitimately. \n\nAnd I didn't say 50+ is a \"small team\", I said it's a modest one. There's been many, many other titles with teams much bigger that have had longer-running issues than what LE currently has.",

            "My friend I mean this with nothing but kindness. I\u2019ve played Poe since beta like 12 years ago. Not once have I played an entire league until the next league drops. It\u2019s okay to get 60-200 hours of enjoyment from a game then move on to something else until an update pulls you back. We now live in the golden age of arpgs with last epoch, Poe, Diablo 4, and torch lite just to name the big ones. \n\nProgramming takes a lot of time and effort. It takes time to hire people and for them to learn their specific tech stake and quirks. It takes time to make game design decisions. It takes time to implement. It takes time to QA and then even more time to troubleshoot when it\u2019s running on 100s of different types of environments. I\u2019ve worked on much much simpler projects than video games that took over 2 years to go through functional specification, implementation, QA then go live. \n\nIf you listen to the last epoch dev streams, read their Reddit comments, or join their discord it\u2019s clear as day they have a passion for the game. They want it to be the best it can be and are working hard towards that. But it\u2019s literally impossible to please everyone and do everything. Every time they decide to improve, implement or add something their having to chose to not do 100s of other things. All that\u2019s to say try some other games, it\u2019s okay to move on then come back later. This game will be around and continually improving for years to come.",

            "I'd consider \"slightly inconvenient\" a pretty big understatement, but that may just be me.\n\nIf we're talking purely about the league mechanic itself, there are several annoying parts to it:\n\n- Haunted mods being forced upon you and having to do the whole mod shuffling before every single map\n\n- The given inventory space for both allflames and corpses is laughably small, especially given the fact that the corpse storage can't even store a single full graveyard worth of corpses\n\n- You having to bury corpses 1 by 1 manually feels like quality of life from 1990\n\n- there's no way of telling how many and which kind of corpses you've already buried other than keeping track of them yourself\n\n- The point above and the way corpse crafting works basically forces you to use both craftofexile and a graveyard planner/simulator to get any good use out of it\n\n- The text boxes of corpses are huge in maps and always showing while blocking all kinds of other content below it, so you can't even ignore the mechanic and even if you don't want to interact with the graveyard at all, in order to get rid of these corpses in maps you need to pick them up and drop them instead of just being able to delete them on the spot or hideout the with a filter or toggle them to not be shown at all or just something\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm a big crafting enjoyer, I try to craft my own gear whereever I can even super juicy endgame items and I also enjoyed Og Harvest quite a lot, but this is just way too annoying to interact with for my taste. I only tried like 3 full graveyard crafts, I got 3 okayish items, but nothing crazy and after that I just did the challenge stuff and haven't touched it again.\n\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about the mechanic is that allflame drops are pretty fun. Being able to add all sorts of mob types with their own drop pools to maps is a cool idea and I would've been fine if the whole league mechanic was just allflames.\n\n\nBut yea, there are a lot more reasons to why so many players dislike the league mechanic beside shitty UI.\n\n\nBase game changes like sextant removal and new scarabs are good though. The state t17 maps is questionable though to say the least.",

You need CoE to min max it but that goes for almost every form of high end crafting in the game.\n\n>The text boxes of corpses are huge in maps and always showing while blocking all kinds of other content below it\n\nThis is another extremely minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of things.\n\nThe only changes I dislike about the league is the changes to veiled orbs, and the need to buy extra stash tabs to run the league mechanic effectively. Everything else has been overwhelmingly positive for me.",

I assume you need a couple dozen or maybe 100+ full graveyards to hit some mirror tier stuff though right? I kinda doubt you can make some near mirror tier stuff remotely consistently with single crafts, or can you?\n\n\nBy the way, are you shadow banned on reddit or something? I do not see your reply in my notifications, I only saw it because I browsed through this thread again and saw your response.\n\n\nAnyway, I guess people just value different things, because I don't care when a crafting method is OP as hell if it's locked behind a clunky mechanic that isn't fun to me."

It was quite overwhelming winner for them, with \"No Time Limit\" coming in second just a slightly ahead of 1 week.  \n\nMeanwhile, the results for those who voted 3, 4 and 5 move more further towards 1 week than 2 weeks or no limit.\n\nIt's also important to keep in mind that \"No Time Limit\" is not just picked because people want it to last longer, but also as a principle answer for \"It shouldn't be released until it's defeated\" - which from the discussions we've seen not many are expecting to be even a week.\n\nOne week is a good compromise from all fronts as it's not the shortest or the longest, and it's what we think internally is a good time as a failsafe in case the boss isn't defeated in that time. If the boss is defeated earlier than that, it'll be released before that (next working day).",

If I transform into something else as a primalist then I don't need to worry about mana anymore. \n\nBut how to sustain rage? Ok we have a lot of passives and skill nodes provide rage on hit/cri, but there is a fundamental problem that the more hits/crits you do the more meteor you trigger and the more rage you spend.\n\nThen I find that the spriggan form has it's special method to generate rage by summoning vines. Actually there is a build guide on lastepochtools which utilize Harbinger of Star in spriggan form. Now the problem is that the best transform skill for casting meteor is werebear form because it can convert strength to spell damage, but you can only summon vines in spriggan form...wait, there is an unique boot called Eterra's Path can summon vines for you while moving, and it also works while rampaging in werebear form.\n\nNow with the rage sustain problem solved, the build works but it's still quite weak because werebear is lack of fast attack skills to trigger meteor. Actually the best skill for primalist to trigger meteor is tornado but only swarmblade can use tornado...Oh wait there is a pair of unique gloves called Rule of Simoon which can cast tornado on hit.\n\n[https://www.lastepochtools.com/planner/oXlN0dbo](https://www.lastepochtools.com/planner/oXlN0dbo) \n\nNow here is the final build.

            "I did a druid harbinger combo as well but I didn't care about mana at all as I was just getting enough CDR and transforming to human<->bear repeatedly. You refill mana on transform to bear (which happened every 8s or so).",
            "Cleaver solution+low life is a really easy path for primalist to become ultra tanky.  You get a lot of damage reduction and defenses to the point that the main issue is usually damage for these builds.  Strength is a miracle stat giving you armor, ward retention, and damage which scale extremely well with the defensive layers afforded to primalist.  That's why in the pre 1.0 patch, EQ beastmaster was regarded so highly, because it was ultra tanky, pretty fast, and most importantly, wasn't atrocious to play with good damage.  That being said, it looks like red ring+harbinger damage reduction is doing a lot of heavy lifting here since they're using the more traditional 2 exsang mod build rather than having last steps+gloves and should be around 5K stable ward which is a little under what I would want to push higher corruption.  \n\nAs for why they're using maelstrom+warcry instead of furyleap, it's because part of this idea has been explored for autobomber druid builds.  You definitely want maelstrom stacks if you can get them because storm bolts help you proc meteors and gain some rage on top of the other buffs maelstrom gives and warcry is a free way to get maelstrom stacks while also giving you a lot of extra survivability and vacuums so the meteors hit more things.  As a result, you end up without a slot for fury leap.  Also if you maul, you stop rampaging and have to wait for the animation, but for this kind of build, you want to rampage as much as possible.\n\nFWIW in the pre 1.0 patch I did mess around with a version of this build in ~200-250 corruption and usually my problems began when I got bounced out of werebear form or wasn't proccing meteor/critting enough which both should be solvable with better gear, so I could see this build being playable with BIS gear in higher corruption.",

            "I've tried maul. The problem for maul is that you have to spec in Fury Leap or Entangling Roots to summon vines. This build requires spec-ing at least 3 skills, Werebear form, Spriggan form and Tornado. So if you spec in Fury Leap or Entangling Roots, there will be only one skill slot left available, which means you give up the roar - maelstrom - storm bolt mechanism because that requires spec-ing 2 more skills, thus you lose a significant proportion of your DPS that you have no way to make up.\n\nWhy this build can survive 1000 corruption? Because you don't need to stop moving for more than 1 second. And the ward is not poor at all. With strength converted to intelligence, you have about 400% ward retention. Last Steps of the Living provides 11%-15% missing health gained as ward/s, you can use a tier 5-6 experimental affix on gloves to make up the loss from not using Last Steps of the Living. The ward of my test character is 5k+.\n\nI can make a video but I don't have a youtube account.",

            "Exactly what i was thinking\n\nAnd for damage i doubt meteor is enough for bossing at 1000corruption easily like OP says. I doubt it is achievable in a decent timing or maybe tornado  make it proc a lot more than i think (more than 10 time per second on mono target???)\n\nBecause meteor damage is good enough for echoes but definitely not high, you don't have any more multiplier of meteor tree and strength stacking is good but can't make up for it.\n\nI mean this build with all his very expensive stuff should works on 400c but not very much higher, not for boss.",

            "They are going to use ward. After u get to a certain spot on the hp bar indicated by a marker on the bar (kinda like d4 boss bar) the boss will gain ward. He showed an example of a boss having 4 blips?! (Not sure what to callem) Also said some bosses could have more or less. also getting to the blips causes a small stun to the boss he said more of an interrupt.",
            "Ok thanks did they say what happens at each section after you reach the blips like for example before blip 1 0% dmg reduction blip 2 25% dmg reduction etc? I am confused",
            "You should go watch the vod",
            "No more dr when u hit a blip the bar fills with ward and u gotta get thru that ward and hp",

        "content": "I know ailments inherit general damage multipliers (which are not specifically for hits).\n\nWhat about spells cast while using a certain skill?\n\nFor example if I use the skill surge with the \"Electropulse\" node, casting lightning blasts during surge, do I double dip in for modifiers in both the storm blast tree and in surge?\n\nFor example if I take storm battery or concentrated battery which have generic more damage, do the strom blasts benefit from this? same for the ward on hit?\n\nAt first I thought you cannot double dip, but if I look at the \"ride the lightning node\" it says surge deals more lightning spell damage, and it is connected to the nodes that make you cast stromblast, so if you cannot inherit this to the stormblast there isn't much point, as surge is a melee skill.\n\nWhich makes me wonder, can you double dip?",

            "If it is a subskills = a skill that proc in a main skill tree and has not a tree of his own then it inherit damage modifier from the main skill tree (more and flat and ailments chance)\n\nIf it is a skill that has his own tree then he doesn't inherit the tree of the skill that triggered it.\n\nSome very rare subskills can be boosted in different skill tree (caltrop in net and aerial assault), some other has items that boost them in addition of their inheritance of main skill tree (fire dagger relic and fire dagger of cinderstrike)\n\nSo no double dip.",
            "Thanks.\nI see, so basically \u201cride the lightning\u201d spell damage buff component doesn\u2019t work for lightning blast?\n\nIt seems a bit poorly designed as surge is a melee skill. Which means that this node will not buff surge or lightning blast.\n\nI assume it can buff spark charge, but then it would make more sense if it wasn\u2019t placed past the lightning blast nodes.",
            "I went to see the specific tree and yes it is a very strange tree part...\nIt shouldn't impact lightning blast by usual rule.\n\nMaybe the more spell lightning damage is global during surge but in that case the wording is wrong.\n\nhttps://forum.lastepoch.com/t/surges-electropulse-ride-the-lightning/41704"
