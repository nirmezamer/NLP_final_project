Then I unexpectedly tripped over my shoelace probably a good 10-20 yards away from where I originally started running and when I looked up the ball was headed directly for my belly. My life flashed before my eyes as I put my hands up to protect myself and somehow ended up catching it.

It would be like saying an American child can go behind the back in Basketball by the time they're 13, but if there is a video where a European kid does it so smooth he breaks the defenders ankles its still a sick move. I'm not going to be like, any average American defender would read the hips on that and keeps his balance off his heels to not get broke. \n\nYou say you'd press up or the move isn't applicable, but the biggest difference between pros and really technically good players is knowing when moves are going to be effective and using them in those moments. Nutmegs are not worth it most of the time if you look at risk/reward, but some of the sickest goals start with nutmegs.

He appears to have intended for the ball to end up exactly where it did: in position for a shot on goal with no need for an extra touch to control the ball before striking. I wasn't particularly good at football, but even I could do the flip thing from behind and time the ball to catch it if it was only a few feet away. Getting it to a particular place so far away ahead of me so I could strike with a single touch is something else entirely. This is the kind of thing a talented youth league player can do, but do not be fooled. It is very hard for a casual.",

A great player plays with his head up, reading the game, knows when to make that long pass or not, is really fast at changing pace, and probably one of the most important things is the first touch, receiveing the ball with purpose already knowing what he is going to do next.

A normal rainbow flick is done with two touches, the roll up onto the back of the opposite foot, then the flick. This guy does the roll, but the flick is only to give the ball a little height, then he has a third touch with the outside of his right foot is what send the ball forward. Not doing the flick on the second touch freezes the defender slightly before he sends the ball forward, plus the extra touch increases the difficulty of the move. It\u2019s is also the reason why the ball travels much higher and farther forward than what you\u2019d normally be able to achieve with a standard rainbow.

            "This is what its been called in the english version of Fifa for a long time. Idk what its called elsewhere, but ive only ever known it as a rainbow. Im American.",
            "There are multiple rainbow moves, but this is an advanced version of it, which is seen as much harder than the standard flicks.",
            "Because it\u2019s not really a rainbow",
            "This is basically a one to one of the \"advanced rainbow\" from the Fifa games fwiw. Not sure what you would call it otherwise, which is why I called it that. Ive never heard it called anything else tbh.",
            "Yeah I mean a competent defender would push the guy away, I think the more impressive wall was that volley",
            "Absolutely agreed",
            "With snowballs and polar bears",
            "With determination and tears",
            "What the fuck is that supposed to mean?",

            "Oh the irony.",
            "Nope, definitely it was because he waxed that defender with a dope skill. You guys are seriously overestimating how often a move like this gets pulled off...",
            "I don't think that the US is bad team by any means, but Concacaf is absolutely a farmer's confederation.",
            "I mean if you play with numbers enough maybe not being in the top 10 doesn't sound that bad?",
            "You're a certified hater.\n\nYou just wrote a lot of nothing \"hue heu the best player is not the one who does tricks\", no it might not be but any player who's good at dribbling and getting passed 1v1 situation is to KILL for in any team. \n\nThey make every play possible because the teammate and coach knows that they can create situations. It also does not mean that you can just do one or the other, a player who can do tricks and dribble can just as well \"read the game\" and what not. They make the game fun and exciting for everyone.",
            "I mean this is a 1v2 situation drill and not a game. A quick search of this highlight shows it\u2019s from an event in Switzerland, so it looks like even most Europeans think this was a nice move and the kid has talent. Maybe you and your friends could all lock this dude up at 13 and easily score on these crappy European players too. Regardless, as it turns out Americans were not involved.",
            "It\u2019s well timed and executed and has a lot of power behind it. It\u2019s a bit more than a rainbow flick. This is considered an advanced rainbow, which has that extra kick, which is much more than a simple flick. I\u2019d agree not difficult to do in practice, but does take some skill to do it in a match.",
            "Nah dude this is pretty fucking easy. I used to play almost every single day in college 5v5 with random dudes, you see way more impressive stuff than something like this. I'm from south america though, so there's that.",
            "This never works in an actual match. That's why you never see pro players do it.",
            "Personally my dumptruck always used to get in the way when i did it the normal way, so I normally did it similarly to this so I could hit the ball better",
            "No, it is much harder to do a 2 touch rainbow flick as you call it and give the ball that height arc. Doing it in 3 touches is a bit easier.",
            "They created the word",
            "Because you guys don\u2019t have a sport also called football that is the most popular sport in your country.\n\nIn America we need to differentiate between the two, so we use Soccer.",
            "Yes, depending on your definition of \u201cmany\u201d, it very well could mean that lol. \n\nI\u2019m aware that it is called football by the overwhelming majority of the world",

            "As a baby confirm, I can Brazilian this",
            "They kick hard enough to reach it",
            "on =/= in",
            "According to my wife they use the bladder as a soccer ball.",
            "Nutsack den?",
            "I\u2019m confused on how my comment is in any way saying babies grow in the bladder. As a baby grows in womb/uterus it puts pressure on organs, I was making a joke about how some women make the statement \u201cit feels like he/she is kicking me in bladder\u201d",

            "Why so serious, US is pretty shit at football. Even casual viewers know that",
            "Not sure if it would have an individual name honestly. \nA rainbow flick however flicks the ball with the other leg, has a different method of getting the ball off the ground to start and generally has more of a sideways movement to it",
            "That\u2019s what you call it. It\u2019s the advanced rainbow. Much harder than the rainbow flick, which can be done usually standing still. It\u2019s more of a kick than a flick.",
            "It's a reference to other comments in this thread. Comments like \"fun fact: Brazilian babies can do this at 3 months old\"",
            "The reaction was most definitely because off the skill, but this still happens quite often. We'd get reactions like this at least once a day when I was a kid playing",
            "Oh no. He definitely waxed him. I dig it, i think people are hating here so much lmao. Didn\u2019t mean to discredit the move or anything. \n\nLike the comments that keep saying a goalie would\u2019ve smacked that out, but\u2026if someone did this in a full match, they\u2019d try and do it so it wasn\u2019t so close to the box. \n\nIt\u2019s a fun video, people are overly critical of shit. \n\nI love that he seemingly did this and pulled it off in the heat of a do or die 1v1 in the final or something.",

            "I\u2019m American. I was average in high school if that. I never played beyond this. I could not only do this I could juggle with my heels. If you play for 10 years as a kid you can probably do this.",
            "If a pro player does it in an actual match, they'll get fouled after because opposition players will see it as 'showboating' or 'disrespectful'",
