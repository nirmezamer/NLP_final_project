            "I've been watching and reading a lot of phone reviews lately and been planning on switching from Android to ios, what's the best value iphone in 2024? Many reviews say it's the iphone 13 pro... but I'm not really knowledgeable on ios devices.",

Was planning on getting the iPhone 15 plus. Is it better to get that now or get a battery replacement and then wait til September for the discount?",
            "Hi!\n\nI'm thinking about switching from Android to iOS and I'm curious to know how they hold up on the long term.\n\nSo, for people who still uses an older iPhone (13 and older):\n\nHow long does your battery lasts and do you experience any lags, stutters or bugs?\n\nAlso, I'm currently using a low/mid-range Android and I live in a country where iPhones are extremely expensive; should I get the 15PM now or wait for the newer model?\n\nThanks in advance!",
            "I have an 11 Pro Max that has been super slow and wonky lately. My battery health/capacity says 75%, but I believe it is actually much lower than that.

Additionally, the charging port is fucked. Constantly disconnecting and reconnecting.\n\nneed a new phone, been thinking of getting the 15pro from costco for 1269 when back in stock as it comes with applecare+ which maybe I should do since I am clumsy. Could also get it from apple, since costco does not carry the blue color.\n\nWas also thinking of swappa, and maybe get a 12-14pro? Thought theyre a bit expensive, checked apple refurbished and 800 for a 12 or 13 pro refurbished is..potentially too much?\n\nWhat do y'all think? I tend to keep my phones for a while but I somehow ALWAYs ,manage to break them around the 4-6 year mark :(",
            "Currently have an iPhone 11 Pro Max with about 75% battery life. It\u2019s been a bit laggy recently and dies pretty quickly. Thinking of upgrading. Is it worth waiting for the iPhone 16 pro max or should I go ahead and get the 15 pro max?",
            "So basically my Iphone X is currently getting outdated, and my parents have given me a challenge. My Dad had an Iphone 13 Pro max, which he had used originally for around a year or two and instead decided to upgrade. I don't really prefer large phones like the Pro max, so im thinking about either trading the Pro max in for it, or my second option is selling the phone somewhere like Ebay or anywhere else.  Its in very good condition, any ideas on how much i should sell it for? Im looking to get the extra money from selling it and buying an Iphone 13 Mini and having that spare cash. However this may take time and i think about just trading it in, although im confused on wether or not i'll get extra money. Getting back to the question though, how much should i sell it for offhand?",
            "I was geared up to buy the iphone 15 base model, but have read about people being disappointed in the front-facing camera for selfies, that they are overly processed, dark and detailed. As someone who does take a fair few selfies from time to time, would this be enough of an annoyance to not buy a 14/15? I've heard of people having to screen-shot the camera screen or take bursts every time which seems like a bit much. I'm upgrading from an iphone X. Thanks!",

It shoukd probabyl last me until end of next year since I might be getting a 15 Pro when the new 16 series drops. \n\nMain use cases would be Gaming (Mobile Legends, Honkai Star Rail and Genshin Impact) and Social Media. \n\nThanks in advance!",

I would like to know if there are any carrier bands like FR2 mmWave bands (apparently n258, n260, n261) that may be missing from Japanese phones that may render them useless in another country. Admittedly I got this from a post from a few years back and it may no longer be relevant. Any info will be appreciated.",
            "Hi, thinking about replacing my iPhone 11.\n\nFirst option is a renewed 14 pro 256gb from the apple store at $850, second option is a new 15 pro 128gb at $1000.\n\nI would definitely go for the 14, I'm only hesitating because of the new AI.

My 13 pro max broke so I got myself an android phone for $200 to survive until apple releases the 16 pro max. \n\nPaying \u00a31099 for an iphone 15 pro max now doesn't seem like a smart move. I looked up 14 pro max refurbished and that's for 850 at least so not worth it. \n\nIf I buy the 15 pro max now, when approx will we get software update for the new ai features that may be coming with the 16?",

Apple are not known for ever being cheap, it\u2019s pretty hard to get an iPhone for anything except full price. I think they are not selling the latest models, only older ones.  But, all still in box, sealed. \n\nAm I missing something?  Is it possible they are fakes?  Or, can people get hold of bulk iPhones in older models to sell cheap?",

On one hand, I\u2019m thinking the bigger screen would be nice since I edit and capture a lot of social media content for work. I also read a lot on my phone, so a bigger size would mean less eye strain. However, people have said it\u2019s a lot heavier and difficult to hold. Not sure if it fits in a pocket.\n\nOn the other hand, the iPhone 13 Pro is cheaper, lighter, and easier to hold one handed. I\u2019m used to the size since it\u2019s similar to my iPhone 11.\n\nWhat\u2019s your experience?",

            "Hi ! I\u2019d like to go for a new iphone but i'm not sure which one I should get. \nMy current phone is a SE 2020 that I have since december 2020 (its battery is dead, even Apple replacing it themselves didn\u2019t really work for some reason). I don\u2019t want the phone to be too expensive or flashy since I live in an area where I prefer avoiding exposing wealth too much. I have a budget of around 600 euros (refurbished on Backmarket, perfect state). Which phone would you advise ? Thanks in advance everyone ! (Sorry for my english too)",

            "Hi all! So my younger sister is looking to maybe get a new phone but I am personally a Samsung user and know nothing about iphones. My sis has been using an old SE 2016 and is in need of an upgrade but she has a few things she wants to keep, mainly the home button and a headphone jack. I know the newer SE models have the button but I'm not sure about the headphone jack. Any suggestions?",

            "I try to hang onto phones for as long as I can without upgrading. I\u2019ve had my 8 Plus since fall 2017. Before that was a 1, then a 3 which was stolen, and which I replaced with a 4S.\n\nBecause of this pattern, I\u2019m wondering if it still might be worth buying a Pro, even though I\u2019m probably considered a casual user. I\u2019m on my phone a ton, so I\u2019ll get good use out of whatever I end up buying. \n\nMy thinking is that spending a little more on the Pro for a better screen, camera etc. will be something that really didn\u2019t cost all that much extra more than the non-Pro over the 5+ years I\u2019m hoping my next phone will last me. \n\nThoughts? \n\nI don\u2019t have much interest in buying new phones and reselling / replacing them every few years, but I guess the savings in buying non-Pro might mean I replace my next phone a little sooner\u2026That said, I\u2019ll probably just run my next phone into the ground regardless of which version I buy.",

            "Hi! I want to switch to using an Iphone and have used an Android phone for my whole life and basically my phone has been broken for about 2 months now and not having a phone for work or just simply socialising (coming from a person who doesn't even socialise or use social media a lot) has been rough, personally I am not really up to date with Apple news and was wondering if waiting for the 16th model is worth the wait and I was also wondering if they're gonna do anything new or revolutionary with the 16th one because I am currently eyeing the Iphone 15 (I don't know if I should get the Plus, Pro or Pro Max) because of the Dynamic Island, it seems pretty cool and the Iphone 15 is the only model that has it. \n\nNow I want to know if the Plus, Pro or Pro Max are worth it, I have started to work on myself and fashion-wise as well (one of the reasons I wanna switch to using an Iphone as well) so I wanted to maybe start posting pictures and whatnot when I get the new phone, so I was just briefly reading the spec comparisons between the Plus, Pro and Pro Max and I'm gonna be honest when I was reading the differences I don't really know what half of them meant, but from what I've seen the changes aren't a lot compared to the base model, so is it worth getting the upgrade versions? or is the base model fine as it is, money isn't that big of a problem but it is big enough where I really need to know if getting the other versions (Plus, Pro and Pro Max) are really worth it.",

            "Best sites to buy preowned iPhone? I am looking to buy a preowned iPhone that doesn\u2019t cost too much to use as a business phone. I don\u2019t need anything fancy, just something to have separate from my personal and be able to use social media apps on it, zoom/teams, and to call/text clients. I found a great deal with Visible (from Verizon) for a preowned iPhone 12 64gb for $280. With taxes, fees, and phone service plan it would\u2019ve been a total of around $315 but I have come to find out that the site has been an absolute nightmare to purchase from. I have tried 4 times now to buy the phone and encounter an issue each time saying there\u2019s errors with my card (there\u2019s not) and then it suddenly says the phone is out of stock when it\u2019s clearly not. I have gotten in touch with their CS several times with no use. Would love to know if there\u2019s other places to look.

            "It's time for me to change my iPhone. Coming from an iPhone SE 2020, I wanted to move to the more modern designs without the home button, and I thought the iPhone 12 might be a good one, since I need 256gb and it's kind of an older model, I could get it without emptying my wallet. However, I'm wondering if it would be a good move as I tend to keep my iPhones for at least 3 years and I'd like to keep my iPhone system up to date. I've read different articles that say different things about Apple's system support for each model, some say up to 5 years after the release date, others say up to 7 years after the discontinuation date... is there a guaranteed amount of time for system support? The iPhone 12 was released in October 2020 and discontinued in September 2023. Would it be a good move for me to go for the iPhone 12 or would an iPhone 13 be better?",

I know we have the 15 Plus already but my budget is not big enough for that one. My question is, should I get an iPhone 14 Plus with 128GB of storage space or 256GB?

            "I'm starting to think that it might be finally time to upgrade my 5s. My first ever smartphone which I bought secondhand 7 years ago. It's worn out three batteries and two cases and is still doing great - no noticeable performance issues except for the battery. The last person who changed the battery for me warned me that the chip in the charging port is going bad and I'm going to have more or less permanent battery/charging problems going forward. So yeah, it holds a charge for a few hours, but I do put a lot of demands on the battery (including using it as a hotspot for my home office) and it seems recently that it's trending towards being less and less effective. Last two days I had trouble charging it past 20%, thought it was really about time to think about a new one, but then I had a brainwave and cleaned a bunch of lint out of the charging port with a toothpick and now it's back to the averagish form it's been in for the last year or so. Anyways, anyone has any tips or ideas for how I can keep up a usable performance for another few years? Ideally I would have liked to get ten years of use out of it. The thing is that there's really nothing I want to upgrade about it. I like the small screen size, the camera is perfectly fine for what I need (I have a separate camera for taking high quality photos), all the apps I need work just fine, just the touch ID stopped working and I hated using that anyways. It's very annoying to have to get a whole new phone, fine tune all of its settings all over again, transfer all the credentials etc just because some poor quality minor component failed. I looked into it a bit though and it seems that replacing the charging chip would be more expensive than a new phone. Is it worth trying to keep it going for some time or should I bite the bullet and get another phone? I was thinking maybe an iPhone 8 might still be OK, or are the SEs any good? I want to have a phone without any unnecessarily privacy-invading features like AI, Face ID, any kinds of trackers and notifications that can't be turned off. When I got this phone the first thing I did was turn off every kind of notification and every kind of tracker. I don't need my device to know everything about me and I don't need it always calling for my attention, I just need it to access the things I need when I need to",

That's the very last home button iPhone so it's really the only choice here. And it's already 2 years old so not worth paying the full retail asking price for. She should probably say goodbye to the home button and the headphone jack as these are just gone from any new models including new SE models. For the headphone jack Apple sells a cheap and reliable USB-C adapter that I use myself, it's cheap enough you can get a couple for every set of headphones and just keep the adapter permanently attached to each pair of headphones.\n\nNot worth buying a worse iPhone just to get the home button.

            "The 12 Mini will be supported for the next 3 years easily. It might not be on the latest iOS for the 3rd year but it's absolutely fine to keep using it for a while still. The best thing about the 12 Mini is that it is the cheapest iPhone you can possibly get for a smooth nice iOS experience with fairly modern hardware. The battery is bad though, for a used one you should get the battery replaced through Apple for 100 bucks at the beginning. So you'd have to add that on top of the purchasing price.\n\nOtherwise a 13 has better battery life and isn't expensive, and the bigger screen is more usable.\n\nBut yeah for using it for just 3 years, which isn't long, any iPhone 12 or 13 will be just fine.",

            "wait for 16 generation",
            "Many people say iPhone 13 is the best cheap iPhone you can buy nowadays.",
            "The 13 but it doesn't have too much memory meaning multitasking isn't great, it will often have to close background apps. Otherwise it's a decent iPhone especially for the price. You can still find it brand new from retailers getting rid of old stock. Keep in mind it's an older device so the camera isn't special, display brightness isn't what current 2024 smartphones can do, and so on. You can also get an iPhone SE 2020 for like 100 bucks, it runs the latest iOS 17 and later this year it will also run the new iOS 18. The hardware is trash but iOS runs smooth enough to get an idea of how iPhones are like. It just won't be much fun but you can try out the OS and install apps and see how it's like.",
            "Pro Max\n\nGodo- Everything, and it will get AI.\n\nBad- Battery life is 15ish mins less than the 15 Plus.\n\nPlus\n\nGood- 15 min better batter life than the PM and its lighter\n\nBad- Lacks everything the PM has.\n\nAction Button- Its way more reliable and versatil. Depending on Focus and location I set it to do different things or bring up different menus.",
            "Maybe you want to wait until the iPhone 16 is announced in September, then the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus will see some discounts although that might still take a while.\n\nThe 14 Plus is a solid iPhone but nothing to write home about. Average display brightness (800 nits typical, which is not a lot, the 15 Plus can temporarily go up to near 2000 nits in intense sun), no zoom camera at all, only .5x wide angle and the regular 1x (the 15 Plus at least gets a 2x mode), and it still has the old lightning port which is fine but somewhat annoying - if you forget to bring the cable on the go you can't charge.\n\nI am sure with the 14 Plus you will be happier than with the Xiaomi, iOS is pretty great after all and the 14 Plus has plenty performance and battery life, and if you are in a hurry it seems you can afford it right now and enjoy using it soon. But if you can wait for the 15 Plus to be discounted that would be just a bit nicer.\n\nIf you have 50GB free the 128GB iPhone might be enough, but depending on what apps you use on the iPhone and how much content you download/sync you might get close to running out. And just like on Android, iPhones absolutely do not like running out of storage. So if you want to keep it for 4+ years I'd really suggest the 256GB model. (You can always sell the iPhone in order to upgrade and get some money back, the 256GB models sell very well and 128GB and 256GB are probably the most popular storage sizes.)\n\nIf you take few photos and no or rarely videos, and stream most content, 128GB are surely fine. But imagine transferring over the files from your Android and then years of adding media, taking photos, you'd run out.\n\nI have 256GB and ever year I offload some videos and photos to the computer to free up space, that way 256GB are fine for me, but I need to move my recordings to the computer or I'd run out eventually. If your iPhone is your main device I suggest 256GB, if you can offload files to your computer then maybe 128GB are ok.\n\nOne last note about your Xiaomi, it's the classic Xiaomi that has a lot of hardware features like 100MP camera, 120Hz display, very fast charging, huge battery, combined with an awful miui Android. iOS is much better but the 14 Plus hardware might feel a bit lackluster since camera, display, and charging speed are just average. It's still the better smartphone, but it might take a while to notice it. A 15 Pro would be a more noticeable upgrade as it has a fantastic camera, display, and so on. Since these iPhones last a long time you could try to grab a used one from someone in your area in September, some people upgrade to a new Pro yearly and then sell their \"old\" Pro for a good price sometimes. Though that might not be for you as it has the smaller display, and a 15 Pro Max would certainly be way too expensive.",

            "Oh okay, the 14 plus is fine and certainly nicer overall so that's a good purchase for sure. You could get an Android instead, I actually use Androids as well and some are just fine. Right now though I don't see any Android phone on the market that I would easily recommend, I liked the Pixel series in the past but the battery life isn't too great and the fingerprint readers on the Pixels are trash currently which takes the Pixel 8 Pro from a solid phone to a daily annoyance.",
            "Thanks, Got the black. \n\nThe S24 was a great hardware, yet the software isn't as smooth as my iPhone 13 pro max! \n\nI do a lot of editing and password entering, but that was all manual on android even after setting up all possible settings, so I just returned it although it was a great deal for a 1TB phone."

It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n\u200b\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n\u200b\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n\u200b\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

            "Hello,\n\n1. How come iOS doesn't automatically tell users of the battery health going under 80%? I never saw them in both old iPhone 11 Pro Max and 12 mini.\n\n2. How many times have you changed your batteries in each iPhone so far and how long between?\n\n3. How low did you let your iPhone's battery health go before replacing it? \n\n4. Where did you replace your batteries? From Apple? An authorized Apple service provider (e.g., Best Buy)? A third party? Yourself?\n\nThank you for reading and hopefully answering soon. :)",

            "The \u201ctouch top AirDrop\u201d thing is so inconsistent for me. I follow the same steps every time - open the share panel, hold the phones top against top, but 70% of the time it just sends my contact card. I don\u2019t get what I\u2019m doing wrong.",

            "My Catalina MacBook and my mavericks MacBook for the longest time just would *not* share anything \u2013 and my iPhone too sometimes for reasons. Now they do, sometimes.  I assume it\u2019s a bug that\u2019ll fix itself eventually. Meanwhile I\u2019m using a usb stick to transfer files when I have to",

            "Weird. I use it almost daily and have found it\u2019s much more reliable now than it was 5 years ago. I literally have no issues with it at all.",
            "For me too has become useless between my iPhone and iPad, but they are an IPhone 8 and an iPad 6th generation so maybe is a thing between too old models. Anyways, it shouldn\u2019t happen.",
            "I get what you are saying this issue is only really with other people and not between your devices because when I use it on my iPad and no issues but when I try to air drop with other friends it never loads or sends \n\nI feel like this became a big issue when they made air drop mainly to share your contact information at first I thought it was a cool thought but it never sends and I have to end up just taking the number down",
            "Same",
            "Airdrop is ass now. Painfully slow. Before, I used to drop files and it connected within a few seconds, able to drop multiple large files. Now it\u2019s just awfully slow that I resorted to using a cable connector.",

That precludes the use of end-to-end encryption, so cloud AI applications have to date employed traditional approaches to cloud security.\u201d\n\nThis most likely has to do with the API and apple protecting it from 3rd party due to privacy concerns.\n\nNot to say I agree or disagree with the choice. Yet this is a con when you pass excessive regulations/overreaching laws.

I can just see the story now of some random app downloaded from a 3rd party App Store or website giving some random person remote control of iPhones or screen mirroring iPhones without users noticing and stealing their data because Apple had to provide the same access to third parties as they provide for themselves in the EU\n\n\nAlso lets you know these features probably aren\u2019t as game changing as Apple would want you to believe if they are fine not bringing the (arguably) signature features of the next version of their OSes to Europe.\u00a0",

So it could be a way for Apple to be petty and push its EU users against the regulations set for them. \n\nIt\u2019s a messy situation all around honestly, at the end, it may only hurt the customers. The EU wants the OS to be more accessible which is very against apples philosophy.\n\nI hope that makes sense\n\nEdit: where\u2019s the disagreement coming from. What information is wrong here?",

            "Ty :D I was pretty certain we wouldn\u2019t be affected as we aren\u2019t part of the EU anymore, I just didn\u2019t wanna say it definitely won\u2019t affect us in UK getting Apple Intelligence etc in case I got it wrong so it\u2019s great you could confirm that",

            "If it will cost them more to implement a new feature in EU than the profit, they are not gonna introduce that feature and ensure it comply with DMA.\n\nSince iPhone mirroring allows you to access your iPhone on your Mac when it is nearby and locked, the Mac have deep access to your iPhoe and there is a certain level of trust between them, probably why this feature doesn't available to non T2 Mac. I don't think Apple will offer this feature if they have to allow others have same level of access because they can't guarantee that is security. Besides, consider there aren't as many Mac user as iPhone user and you need a Mac and iPhone to use it, it doesn't worth their time to make it comply with DMA and lost this feature doesn't impact majority's purchase decision.",

            "There\u2019s a pro and con. \n\nThe Pro - Privacy is bar to none with Apple. Nothing beats them at this game since it\u2019s a close universe. That allows it to create features that are really aren\u2019t possible with other companies due to distrust. Hence why apples version of A.I (if it comes out correctly) single handedly beats other offers. It\u2019s more ingrained in the system and can actually become a lot more helpful because you (the user) don\u2019t mind it looking at your data. Which makes it more personal and affective. \n\nThe Con - it\u2019s not something that plays nicely with others. It\u2019s selfish in its nature due to it being walled up. Not everyone can visit their universe and if so, there\u2019s a cost for entry. It\u2019s tougher for developers who want more to play and limited by what Apple wants. Which at times, Apple is stubborn and requires you to climb mountains to convince them. \n\n\nPersonally I respect the pro rather than the con.
