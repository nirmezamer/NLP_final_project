            "It's all about momentum. Falcons were fucked once the Pats got in their heads. If you go back to watch the cameras on the sidelines the score wasn't even tied yet and the Falcons were convinced they were going to lose.",
            "I know statistically it is definitely more likely, but this being a slow collapse feels like much more of a statement",
            "Assuming a 50% win rate, the odds of winning when down 3-0 are 6.25%. At one point, the Patriots had a 0.2% chance of winning that game.",
            "I feel like getting 4 stops in a row and scoring 4 straight TDs is kind of like coming back from 4 goals down to win. Not that crazy. And this is coming from a football and hockey player.\u00a0",

            "i think that\u2019s an over estimate since that assumes 50% win probability each game",
            "1) It's actually 6.25%, the other user said assuming they lose the series\n\n2) This is straight up false. It's virtually impossible to blow a 9-0 lead (first to 10 wins). Even 3-0 is very unlikely. There have been 5 NFL teams that blew a worse than 28-3 lead.",
            "Didn\u2019t know that. 28-3 lore goes wild. I guess the thing that stands out that\u2019s unique in a reverse sweep is that you have 4 whole games to finish. And Florida won the first 3 games in regulation. 11 goals for and 4 goals against in those 3 games",
            "It\u2019s super hard to compare the last comeback from three games down predates the Super Bowl itself",
            "Yeah, but also back then, the scores were like 5-3, so you could never be down by 25",

            "Agreed, the storyline is much better for Oilers but losing is still losing. Winning the last game is everything.",
            "People will remember how they blew a 3-0 lead in the finals. Of course, the GM and some players will keep their jobs but this is clearly not the scenario they expected.",

He always seemed less stubborn than bones did. Keep Connor and Scheifele apart other than the power play, staple ehlers to the top line, and give Perfetti top 6 minutes and we\u2019re already cooking.",

            "So you're saying they scored 0 points in the previous two Quarters?",
            "i mean 0.2% is based on a model, it's not just the game in a vaccuum. with 4 drives left, the patriots needed 16 points. all the falcons needed to do was stop both 2 point conversions, and score something themselves. they went 0-4 on those drives and the game was tied. is that more unlikely than losing 4 straight hockey games?\n\n  \nthis isn't rhetorical. it's a genuine question because i dont' know.",
            "The patriots never had the lead for a single second of that game. \n\n28-3 is the mount Olympus to climb for a team to out choke. I truly don\u2019t believe it will ever be out done.",
            "Yeah they're different things for sure, the time period is totally different. The Falcons played 40 minutes of insane football and then just.. stopped being capable of moving the ball or stopping the Patriots on offense for the last 18. Like a light switch flipped, night and day in the same game.",
            "Oilers are doing what you guys thought would happen in our series lol",
            "According to @datadrivenhockey on IG, Oilers had a 6.6% chance *to win the cup* ***after game 3***",
            "It will absolutely sting a lot harder if the oilers lose now.",
            "I guess that\u2019s the difference (in my head) between 28-3 and a potential finals reverse sweep. Falcons didn\u2019t even have to play well in that 4th quarter, they just had to do the bare minimum",

            "Honestly? Respect.",
            "I feel like a reverse sweep is a bigger deal than allowing 25 points in half of a football game. I don't know statistics or anything to qualify that belief, it's just how I feel. Edmonton scored 1 goal in the first two games combined.",
            "I mean it\u2019s not even the biggest choke in NFL playoff history, that belongs to the Houston oilers",

            "Bro so was I \ud83d\ude02",
            "I've travelled to a quite a few away games, and honestly as an away fan I've (almost) always been treated with respect in their barn, and they have a great crowd and fanbase. Hated them as a kid, but now that I go there semi-often I respect what they have built.",
            "As a Canadian, if I had to live in Texas I'd be so happy to be able to watch hockey that I'd become a Stars fan for sure!",

That hurts too, but the Falcons hurts worse.",

I respect those who can and do don\u2019t get me wrong, but I just find it kind of bleh and alienating looking at the NBA, NFL, and MLB, and how they\u2019re either overwhelmingly or completely American teams. With Canadian cinema and television almost completely dominated by Hollywood, and music and books only doing marginally better for Canadian visibility in our own country, it can feel like all of our entertainment is just coming from the South.\n\n\nSo for me, yeah, it\u2019s kind of nice to know there\u2019s *something* hugely popular that we as Canadians are so strongly associated with and have contributed so much towards.

            "Relax mate. It's just hockey. We have been on a 34 year pain train. Nobody's said anything about fairweather fans. We know suffering in these parts.\n\nThey're a great team, and aren't dead yet. Oilers have been so bipolar this year we're getting the bends from the ups and downs. They're perfectly capable of a complete stinker on Monday.\n\nBut....that is a very quiet 7 hour plane ride home. No eye contact.",
            "It\u2019s not about you. They don\u2019t owe YOU shit.\n\nGet a fucking hobby if you can\u2019t handle this. I say this from a fanbase that has literally blown the last two 3-0 leads in the NHL, one of those teams going on to win the series and the cup. \n\nAnd it\u2019s sad and shitty but it doesn\u2019t even matter. It\u2019s so much worse for them than it is for you. All YOU do is watch the stupid games. They worked their entire lives to get to this point",
            "I will say it is far easier to enjoy as a \"neutral\" fan (even if I am pulling for the Oilers). I don't really envy either one of you.",
            "Exactly. The very fact the Oilers have forced game 7 proves that anything can happen. Chance and luck also play more of a role in hockey than a lot of other sports. A crazy bounce can change everything.",

Outside the diehards, it was like 70% Knicks coverage this spring. There's virtually no where to play hockey in the 5 boroughs and all your good hockey players come from upstate NY near the Canadian border or western NY. \n\nWhy are you comparing fanbases between a tiny cold Canadian city that has bled hockey for over 100 years (over 50 with the Oilers) vs a hot, beach city that has little opportunity to play ice hockey anywhere and who's fanbase has no central city to congregate in (their arena is in a small suburb and their fans are spread out over a huge swath of suburban sprawl).",

Furthermore, that Brazil team was widely viewed as their worst squad in over a decade, and that was *before* they lost Neymar to injury.\n\n7-1 was extreme, but 4-0 wouldn't have been out of the question before the game started. That's just not a choke. The real choke would have been if they hadn't rescued themselves on penalty kicks against Chile earlier in the knockout round.",
            "lol sure it is.\n\nYou can lose for 20 straight years and that's fine but get reverse swept once while being the best Panthers team in history and that's the end of the franchise.\n\nThat's funny.\n\nAlso.. you haven't been reverse swept dude. What are you not getting about that? You should be getting amped for game 7 not acting like this completely wide open series is over.",

When they know the best can\u2019t get anything. Team will leave for sure franchises don\u2019t recover from this stuff in todays sports",

From Bure Linden Kirk to Markus Brendan Ed, to Henrik, Daniel, Roberto, Bieksa, Burrows....ride or die all the way. And - then - they were VEEEERY hard to love in the Jet Black Jim Benning years when they looked fans straight in the eye and expected us to get excited about Dominic Roussel and Jay Beagle. When the Fiddling Blueberry Prince pushed Linden out of the organization for daring to talk of rebuilds. It was very tough to accept the drivel they were putting out there.\n\nNever hated the team, ever. Their fans, though? That's a whole other story. Canucks fans are to Oilers fans as Frank Grimes was to Homer Simpson. Being a super resentful enemy we weren't even aware of, who thinks we are coasting through life despite gross incompetence, when the reality of being the Homer Simpson of franchises is that you end up taking continuous beatings 99% of the time.",
            "OK, you win. You suck.\n\nI tried. We'll send the forwarding address and shipping instructions for the Cup.\n\nMaurice is a good coach, and a good dude. Hope Nutbag Zito doesn't toss him off a rampart",

If you guys win, just delete your account and save yourself the embarrassment. \n\nThe biggest laughing stock in hockey will be lightning that one year they won the presidents trophy and got swept.",

            "Are you a young fella? I\u2019m 35 buddy. I was born right when the oilers were dynasty good. Growing up in the 90s it was always \u201csurely we will get back to winning ways soon right?\u201d, but the years got darker and darker. Then briefly bright in 2006 before getting even darker for another decade.\n\nBut what I learned along the way is it\u2019s not about how good you feel when you win, but how good it feels to belong to that group of fans, the comfort you share in the good and bad times. As a kid I always liked Florida because I thought you had the coolest logo. The oilers logo doesn\u2019t really pop when you are 5. If we lose Monday, I\u2019m going to be happy you guys finally got one. \n\nEnjoy your weekend amigo",

            "I agree, it was embarrassing and unexpected. Especially since they're considered a strong team.",
            "You're delusional.\n\nThis is already the most successful season in Franchise history. Fanbases don't leave after making it 1 win away from the cup lol. They get more rabid for a cup.\n\nIf you stop being a fan of a team because they lost the finals in game 7 then you were never a fan to begin with. You were just following how the team was doing.",
            "Nah I\u2019ve bought a few times last couple years. As a Calgarian Islanders fan I just will find it funny if I ever win an Oilers 50/50 as an absolute hater, but considering the vast majority of those funds are legitimate Oilers fans yall raise an IMPRESSIVE amount. Prairie people love their 50/50s, it\u2019s funny when I see the Super Bowl is like half a million and people lose their minds when Regina pulled that at a grey cup over a decade ago and the Oilers are pulling over 15 million some draws.\n\nIt\u2019s really the best risk high value lotto you could ever enter.",
            "That's fucking ace. A lot of people have even more reason to be excited this season!",
            "Thanks for finally agreeing.",
            "If the panthers loose Monday they may not even be in Florida soon do you understand they were the laughing stock for so long and now it feels like they will be forever. I get it your an oilers fan and it must have been awesome to have seen the goat win so many but we are lowly panther fans and seeing one cup win in my life is all I wanted and if they loose I know it will never happen and we probably loose the franchise",
            "Series tied and they can\u2019t find any optimism lol don\u2019t even bother with them",
            "I'm older than you friend so I understand your sentiment.\n\nIt's the way they're losing. If this was an even series going to game 7, sure, but they've completely collapsed. Oilers are playing well but the Panthers look like I've never seen them look with this current core. Scared, nervous and hesitant. That's what's making this inevitable loss so much harder. \n\nMyself and many fellow fans are really struggling with this. It's an insane level of disappointment.",
            "You experienced the winning ways we panther fans never have and it feels like we never will",
            "Yet you\u2019re still wrong. Oh well you can hate on NY if you want. There\u2019s a reason it\u2019s the most well known city in the US, and probably the world. And there\u2019s a reason the rangers easily have one of the largest fanbases in the league",
            "Bro 30 years I\u2019ve waited I was 7 when they came to south Florida if the best team we can make gets you up 3-0 and looses wtf would anyone want to follow them anymore especially after I\u2019ve had to see this team stink up the ice for so long. Anyway I\u2019m not delusional I\u2019m realistic if it was back and fourth like win 2 loose 2 win 1 loose 2 then that\u2019s an understandable lose loosing in 7 after being up 3-0 is a straight up embarrassment hell getting swept doesn\u2019t even hurt that bad"
