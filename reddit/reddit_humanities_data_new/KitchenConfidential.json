        "content": "Hello Hello,\n\nJust looking for some help or tips from fellow industry people about professional cook level 1 exam. I've been working in the kitchen for 3 years now at the same place. You know how everything becomes less challenging when you work in the same kitchen 5 days a week for 10-12 hours!\n\nI haven't done culinary school, just dived right in. and its been good so far, learnt a lot of things.\n\nI am planning on challenging professional cook level 1 exam next month. But have absolutely zero clue where to start studying!!!!!!\n\nAs I mentioned, I have no schooling in cooking but am a good learner and learnt to work on all stations and prep in my restaurant within a year and a half!\n\nAny help would be much much appreciated. Any books, websites, anything is appreciated.\n\nAlso, just out of curiosity, how does the whole thing works? I know there's a written exam and a practical. But things like what kind of questions are there in written exam, how many questions, etc. any help pls!!",

            "I pinned the post cause i know how these exams can be and its best to try and get answers from someone who's been through it. You might wanna include your country or state if your in the U.S. so people can help you best. \n\nIn my experience exams like these are usually vocab test. Theyll ask you to explain or demonstrate what this term means and you'll do it.  Next there gonna test you on base skills of cooking. Can you flip, can you cook something without burning, knife skills ect.  They will also ask you history question on the industry. Make sure you know your key players. \n\nTry and see if you have a rubric on what youll be graded on. Thats the best way to prepare. \n\n  \nGOOD LUCK!!!",
            "Hey i just passed the level 1 exam with a 94/100. I think i spent about 15 minutes on it, but I've always been a very fast test taker. Most of the questions are honestly common sense for anybody who has a good amount of professional AND/OR amateur cooking experience. If you are confident in whipping something up from scratch, then I think you will pass without studying.\n\nThat said, I did study a bit and what i studied were mother sauces and their deriatives and stocks. These were not intuitive to me as i have been vegan for almost half my life. I have a ton of sample questions/answers that are almost verbatim to the test. If you would like me to send you anything, lmk.\n\nAlso this is just general advice for multi choice tests, but I will say it in case you don't know: NEVER dwell on a question you don't know. Skip it and come back to it later. Sometimes other questions will even have answers for previous questions!\n\nEDIT: just reread your post and noted you did not go to culinary school at all, this test is VERY by the book. It's also gonna focus on french cooking. As well as terms that may or may not matter in most restaurants. Do you know what a capon is for example.",

            "Usually when someone calls themselves a vegan, but \u201conly eats fish\u201d that\u2019s code for they eat lots of vegetables and a little of everything else. Not that it matters that much but I do get a chuckle out of it.",

A vegan diner (or gluten free or whatever) needs to be educated about they food because the staff don't know shit",

These deadly parasitical infections can also be found in underdone eggs, vegetables that still retain a trace of color after boiling in salt water, and fresh fruit. Canned vegetables and fruit, however, are just fine if carefully coated in a layer of gelatin or aspic.",

            "Ha! Reminds me of a time years ago when a roommate and I moved in together and decided to check out the neighborhood ice house. For those unfamiliar, an ice house in Texas is a divey open-air joint that only serves beer. My roommate told the bartender, \u201cYou should get X beer because that\u2019s what I like.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t go back for another month but the second we walked in the bartender recognized us and said, \u201cHey, we got your beer!\u201d This was a place that keeps their beer on ice instead of in coolers (not unusual for an ice house) so we had to power through an entire case of canned beer that had just been re-iced every day for a month. It was skunky but they did that for her, so we were obligated. It became our regular hangout after that.",

            "When I was still a dishie, kitchen never did it, but servers would just throw knives into the water where I couldn\u2019t see them. I used to thrust my hand in as hard as I could to see if I could get a day off.",
            "I don't have this problem anymore. I have had it in the past for sure, but when I implemented a \"you must wash your own knife\" policy, the problem stopped.\n\nMy current battle is the fucking mandolin. I just switched up the menu and it calls for the mandolin a lot. The fucking guys will leave the blade 'open', like not wind the mandolin closed, so the blade sits proud on the sliding/ramp surface, and plop it in the tank. It drives me nuts. \n\nThe thing is, when grab the thing in the tank, it doesn't feel like a knife, it feels like a cambro or something. So, you just grab the bastard and cut yourself. Drives me insane.",
            "When I was a dishie, I must've been a bit extra cause I'd wear two layers of gloves. Didn't feel like burning myself on hot pans off the line or the hot water or the knives. Fuck it I was armored. I also wore two pairs of socks with a plastic between them to keep my feet from making contact with any nasty water that would drip on my shoes or into my shoes.\u00a0",
            "This is fucking hilarious. \n\nThread title kills it too.",
            "I yelled at someone for this (manger why are you yelling?) Then she took over the yelling. \ud83e\udd23",
            "I let my staff know when they are hired the fastest way to tender their resignation is to leave a knife in the sink. Just once. No discussion needed. Off the schedule immediately.",
            "The \u2018ol grabby/stabby.",
            "Classic game of shark bite! Throw those fingers in for the handle, watch out for the shark!",
            "I don\u2019t know why this is so funny but it is.",
            "I have worked in many kitchens in my life. Nothing major. Mostly cafe and brunch. Now I\u2019m working in a gas station with a full service kitchen with teenagers. \ud83d\ude44 god save me. They\u2019re so f*cking stupid. They spray caustic chemicals on porous cook surfaces, dump knives into sinks full of dirty dish water, and can\u2019t be trusted to pick something up that fell on the floor and take it to be washed. The knives aren\u2019t sharp or particularly dangerous but I don\u2019t want to unknowingly grab a dull knife with wet, slick hands. The holding oven is dangerous enough to clean nightly.",
            "I toss mine from across the room into the soap water.",
            "That\u2019s what pisses me off about AM and why I bring my own knife",

            "Same scenario earned me a set of 3 scars across the front of my knuckles. Years later, when I find a knife in water out comes the story of them scars to get people to stop.\u00a0",
            "I also make them clean the mandolin if they use it. Basically if you use anything sharp, you're responsible for cleaning it. I think I speak for everyone when I call mandolins \"sneaky fuckers\"",
            "Is there any way to make them wash it themselves too? Clearly they can\u2019t be trusted to have the dishie do it :/",
            "I would bring the soapy mandolin back to that line cook- set it sudsy and all right on his cutting board.  He will quit putting it in your sinks after enough times of this.  Gotta do this kinda stuff in kitchens when nobody will listen/change & you know you are absolutely right.",
            "Definitely extra. Someone correct me, but isn't the plastic thing just a recipe for trench foot?",
            "Very, very rarely will I ever raise my voice at work (I think literally only this one time), or give people instructions or orders/put people in their place, as I'm not a boss or don't get paid to care like one... but when I stumbled upon a knife in the filled sink you better believe I went down the line yelling at every single cook asking who tf did it.",
            "Similarly, dropping a Cambro off at the dish pit without using a spatula first is also grounds for immeadiate termination. As well as leaving a pathetic portion left in the oversized container without downsizing.",

            "Yeaaaah I was a bit of an idiot for it and thank god I got lucky and never hurt myself, was just an idiot high schooler doing way too many drugs at the time lol",
            "Yeah iunno probably but I was only part time",
            "It would only be an issue if the inner sock got wet",
            "Wearing two socks in general is actually a way to combat trench foot, wool socks specifically, the outer layer wicks the bottom layer\u2019s moisture off. The plastic would stop the moisture from getting on the inner sock I guess.",
            "I had a ding dong put a tomato slicer ON TOP of a colander. I stared \"that's gonna fall\" 3seconds later it fell blades first on my hand and had 5 perfect slices across the inside my right hand. Same kitchen......yelling \ud83d\ude06 I yell over safety stuff. The issue is I do care, and I've had to emotionally disconnect or I'll have a stroke. Lol",
