            "Answer: Justin Timberlake recently got pulled over for a DUI, I believe in New York. The cop who pulled him over did not know who he was. \n\nThe meme lines are verbatim from their interaction, with Justin saying the tour is going to be ruined and the cop asking what tour",
            "Answer: Aaaaand of course he's got hefty insurance in the case of a tour being cancelled for medical reasons, aaaaand going into rehab actually legally counts as a 'medical reason', aaaaaaaand so the music industry is all abuzz with rumours that this is all just a way for him to cancel a poorly selling tour while not taking a hit financially.....",
            "Answer: Inflated egos led musicians to overestimate their appeal. (They really think ppl are paying for \"Idol Worship\" at these \"Dance Recitals\" of theirs.)\n\nE.g: JLo had cancelled her arena tour last month from poor ticket sales.  I mean, even the best electronic producers in the world have to team-up to pack a stadium...\n\nThe idea that a washed-up actress/singer from 1998 who's contributed nothing to music or culture since, would be worshipped like a real musician today for a few jukebox hits is a crackpot idea. \n\nShe really looks at festival-goers & new musicians with such contempt as she thinks, \"Well i guess ppl will pay to see any crap nowadays\".... Calm that ego",
            "Oh wow, I definitely thought that the dialogue was from Trolls World Tour. \n\nEven if body cam footage comes out that shows he didn\u2019t say this, everyone will think he did for the rest of his life. The world tour probably would have been less ruined if the line hadn\u2019t gone viral.",
            "And there's the double aspect of formerly big celebrities scheduling world tours when nobody wants to see them anymore, like Timberlake's next tour where the arresting policeman had no idea of who Justin was, or Jennifer Lopez's world tour which was recently cancelled.",

This ended up working out in my favor for Madonna tickets I had.  \n\nI was excited about Timberlake tickets but it was before the album and then when the album came out, I never actually bothered to listen to it, so I think I\u2019ve just outgrown Timberlake and would love a refund for a canceled date.",

            "Answer: Lume came up with it and now every major retailer has to compete. And the cycle continues.",
            "Answer: Marketing exists to invent demand for things so that those things make money. Through the 1960's, there was still a very uphill campaign to persuade men that they needed to wear deoderant at all. For decades, Listerine spent bazillions of dollars trying to worry the public that nobody will tell them about bad breath and that they probably have it unless they wash their mouths with *their* new product. I haven't seen these ads, but they're just a new wave of the same \"invent the problem\" phenomenom in purported hygeine products.",
            "Answer: I suspect it has something to do with deodorant being classified (in the US) as a cosmetic, and anti-perspirants being classified as a drug. The latter is more heavily regulated by the FDA historically, although the 2022 Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act might have altered that. \n\nAlso, the Lume brand applied for a patent bc their product uses mandelic acid as a base to alter skin pH. There is a class action lawsuit against some of their claims but they definitely market heavily as working in a whole new way and cost a lot, and it makes sense that other companies would want to compete with it.\n\nEdited to add that as a population, we are more overweight than ever and also living in record heat. There is a big market for neutralizing sweaty folds of skin.",
            "Answer: Some people get sweatier in more places (I'm sure my fellow ladies can attest to boob sweat), and deodorant companies are marketing to that. I, personally, really like the different kinds, I prefer the lotion stuff for my feet.",
            "Answer:  some people do sweat more than other people as a part of the big boob committee. I can honestly say I have been using spray deodorant underneath my boobs and between my boobs during the summer to reduce sweating and smell from sweating. I also have a friend that sweats a lot, no matter what like she legitimately will go out not even walk a half a mile and be drenched in sweat.",
            "Answer: Its literally just a marketing strategy..and I don\u2019t mean that snarkily, it just is. Someone in the deodorant business realized they could put the same product in a new package and make double the profits bc now you \u201cneed\u201d regular deodorant and body deodorant.\n\nSame thing they do with, hand soap, body wash, dish soap, etc. Chemically speaking soap is soap is soap, but they\u2019re making triple off of creating the illusion that they\u2019re all different.",
            "Answer: because a lot of the personal care market targets their advertising based on people\u2019s insecurities, whether known or subconscious. And one of the things that has been pushed on people more and more through the ages is covering up any scent your body makes, whether or not it\u2019s normal and natural.",
            "Answer: Some marketer realized that if they convince everyone that their entire bodies need deodorant then they'll go through the product faster and then all the other marketing firms saw this idea and realized it was brilliant and so they copied it. The whole point of advertising and marketing is to sell more of a product. Making it seem like it's normal to use a product even more means it will need to be purchased more often and therefore the company makes more money.\n\nIt makes perfect sense if you think about it from the company's perspective.",
            "Answer: they make ads for things when they WANT something to be popular, not necessarily when something actually is. The companies making it want people to want it so they are pushing it",
            "Answer: the more you spray every time you apply, the more you buy every month. \n\nThere are plenty YouTube and tiktok videos which look like instructional videos, but are just seeing to gin up demand. \n\nAny time you see a YouTube video where they use massive amounts of hot glue sticks or something like that to make something simple that would be easier to do otherwise, that is why. They're just trying to sell more hot glue sticks.\n\nFrom this evolved the \"spray the deodorant on your feet and your crotch\" marketing campaign.",

None of them are the result of mixing an alkaline substance with fat, which is the technically what soap is .

There are antimicrobial soaps, but 'regular' 'real' soap only washes them away and off your skin, just like the body wash does. Using soap may break down germs and bacteria, but that's not quite the same thing. Real soap is not the same thing the Dove Beauty Bar one may get the store either, but it's not automatically antimicrobial either. \n\nAlso, soap does need lye, usually in the form of sodium or potassium hydroxide, to be considered real *soap*. That said, while lye goes 'in the pot' when you make soap batter, if you have correctly formulated your soap 100% of the lye will be used during the saponification process to be turned into soap. Many soap makers actually put in extra fats (oils/butters) above and beyond what the soap recipe calls for to use all the lye, as this 'superfatting' process can impact the final feel of the soap as well. If there is any leftover lye in the soap you are about to use on your body it will chemically burn you and is not safe to you; leftover lye in the bar means the soap was improperly made and should never be used on the skin.",

            "Answer: (Third time's the charm hopefully it isn't auto removed this time)\n\nZeb Wells is the current writer for the Amazing Spider-Man. His run has been very controversial. Reasons include him making Peter notably weaker than past portrayals losing fights he'd usually win, reforming Norman Osborn and giving him and father/son dynamic with Peter which felt gross given their history, and rolling back his relationship with Mary Jane in a frankly disgusting manner.\n\nPeter and MJ start dating again, they then get trapped together in an alternate universe where this guy and his son Paul helped a death god kill the entire world. Peter gets sent back, MJ is stuck. When Peter gets back in, months have passed for her because time moves differently there and we find out she's effectively cheated on Peter and is now dating Paul and adopted two surviving children with him. At first it's seemingly implied she's only staying for the kids but they are revealed to be illusions who don't really exist and she still stays, she also calls Paul her boyfriend in a recent comic(not written by Wells to be clear). He then proceeded to toss out decades of MJ character development by making her a superhero with Paul as her \"guy in the chair\", MJ had previously shown no interest in the hero life and had her own ambitions and career. To makes things even grosser, Paul's excuse for committing genocide was he was \"just following orders\" similar to what the *Nazis said at Nuremberg*. Peter is completely fine with this and not even mad he effectively was cucked by a nazi, which fans feel is a very underwhelming reaction. As such Wells has burned a lot of trust with comic book fans, especially regarding his treatment of women and relationships \n\nI have to state that it's unclear how much of this is Wells fault and how much is Marvel editorial, as the editorial staff have been actively preventing writers from keeping Peter and MJ together for decades. Fans have been mad at the state of Spider-Man comics and their inability to let Peter grow and change for a very long time and this current run has caused all the anger to bubble over",

            "As someone who's semi-familiar with what the comics industry is like, I'm happy blaming both.\n\nYou have to remember that this is the same environment where the EIC of one of the big two (allegedly) ran up and down the offices yelling \"The r*pe pages are done!\" and nobody considered it weird.",
