        "content": "Hello...... firstly sorry for the delay - I'm a lover, fighter, worker, mensch... things get in the way... things reached for among the stars and things grasped from in the gutter... but it's here now.\n\nRegarding the lists, the letterboxd and Spotify general recs lists are there and ready. The niche recs letterboxd list is there... but I decided to add all recs and then cut it down (stupid) and so some laughably un-niche films have slipped through which I will come back to when I have more time and cull. The niche Spotify list is barebones and effectively a placeholder, but I will eventually add them all on... let's say before Christmas. So, like or bookmark or whatever you want if you're interested, they will in the end be what they should be.\n\nI lifted the bar for the niche films from 10k to 20k, and the niche Spotify list from 10k to 30k. I think 10k was fair with movies but wanted people to get more of their faves in, but on music yeah I was wildly out, I listen to a lot of continental stuff from the 80s that never did anything at the time let alone now, 10k seemed generous but obviously wasn't.\n\n[Letterboxd general recs](https://boxd.it/pWHNs)\n\n[Letterboxd 'niche' recs](https://boxd.it/qbYxQ) (anything over 20k will be removed in the next few weeks)\n\n(shoutout to the users who recced 'Trans-Europ-Express', 'The Night of Counting Years', 'The Chess Players', and 'Belle de Jour or Freddy got Fingered')\n\n[Spotify general recs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/01RezE1n2fRVGjPFM5p080?si=1a422548447a4719)\n\n[Spotify 'niche' recs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7ql9jY39SiDTR9DH4S3Cmy?si=c5d147c1891e463d) (literally at this point a placeholder, come back in a month lol)\n\nBook recs and 'last messages to the sub' I was looking to put into a pastebin but as it's gone 'woke' it no longer allows slurs to be posted, which of course, being the sub, people peppered their replies with... so I went with this ControlC\n\n[Au Revoir, r/rsp](https://controlc.com/d19e6f07)\n\n[r/rsp 2023 Lit Recs](https://controlc.com/2caa6710)\n\nThere are a few glaring omissions when it comes to questions, but then there is every year.

I have friends/acquaintances, including women, who had complimented my appearance, particularly my style, but they could be just being nice for all I know. They're all in relationships unfortunately so I've not been able to ask them out to see if they really do find me attractive.\n\nSo for me the issue isn't thinking that I'm not attractive, it's not knowing if I am or not, which I think is worse in a way because the uncertainty brings with it a lot of anxiety.

Although, this may be due to how autistic I am, I don't really pick up on the more subtle cues.",

You can advertise yourself as a service sub to dominant types, that's pretty much what you're describing. Don't assume too much though about your incompatibility, be open to various types of experiences if you can.",
            "It's not a fetish thing, I am just not aroused by sex and if anything I find it to do the opposite for me. I'd be fine with a sexless relationship but most women would expect at least some pleasure which I why I'm okay with using my mouth/fingers as I don't find that quite as repulsive as I do with PIV sex. But in terms of PIV sex I literally cannot have it, it's impossible or at least very uncomfortable and painful for me. It's not something I can be open too.",

Interaction with cast members is limited to brief responses unless otherwise instructed. Some of the cast members/crew were interns themselves and even though they were treated the same. They kind of treat the SNL interns like how they were treated for some reason.\n4. **Couch Controversy**: Once, a production exec was unhappy with the interns and removed their couch from the break room, forcing them to sit on the floor for the rest of the week. This was because a mistake they made in their order/task.\n5. **Sydney Sweeney\u2019s Cookies**: Sydney Sweeney requested expensive baked goods for everyone. An intern misordered by four, got yelled at by the executive producer, and almost got fired. Ironically, Sydney didn\u2019t even eat the cookie and later gave it to the intern. The intern could only talk to her if spoken to first.\n6. **Marcello\u2019s FIFA Obsession**: Cast member Marcello frequently makes interns buy him FIFA related stuff for his ultimate team and batteries for his controllers because he usually plays FIFA after every table read in his dressing room.\n\nWhy do interns want to work there?\n\nSimply put it pens doors and connections if you know how to leverage and can help you enter Hollywood. if you aren't a nepo baby.",

Specifically before or after a performance. Mid performance is understandably insane. \n\nAn acquaintance from high school became an NBC page, the position you're talking about, and he never seemed to have an issue other than living very poorly by NYC standards. Like tiniest studio apt I've ever seen. \n\nBeing a runner for artist or venue riders and being unable to talk to talent at that level is so normal. When it happens, someone will inevitably do something r'arted like try to pass off a screenplay or some shit to someone, which is totally inappropriate.",
