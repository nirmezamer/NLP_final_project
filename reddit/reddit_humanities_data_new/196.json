(And there are jurisdictions within the US where it's decriminalized only at certain amounts, meaning you can still be arrested and charged for possession over a certain threshold) In the case of states violating federally protected rights, a case challenging the state law would need to make it's way to the supreme court where it would either reaffirm the federal right and force state changes in legislation or side with the state, forcing changes to federal legislation (for example, the overturning of roe v. Wade).

            "NHRL does too, and they actually go way harder with it than Battlebots. In NHRL they actually afford weight bonuses to teams with multiple bots (I'm pretty sure it's a ~50% increase, so in the 3lb class for example a multibot team would be allotted 5lbs) so match ups can get pretty insane. They also give weight bonuses for teams with unconventional locomotion (i.e. bots that move around with shuffling/walking mechanisms), and the combination of these rules allowed some teams last year to be competing in the 3lb weight class with 2 full 3lb bots, or 6lbs total. For obvious reasons this was changed this season (to my knowledge) but the weight bonuses still exist and still make for some bonkers matches. \n\n*Some of this could be slightly inaccurate as it's all off the top of my head but it should be mostly correct since I adore robot combat and NHRL specifically and have been watching for a couple years atp.\n\nAlso NHRL have a tournament streaming today starting in 2 hours! If it's something anyone reading this is interested I highly recommend tuning in for a bit of it.",
            "Ahh, I see",
            "Hell yeah, that makes a lot of sense! I\u2019ve really only seen battlebots matches on YouTube and this NHRL clip. Aside from the weight bonuses, what would you say the draw to NHRL over battlebots is?",
            "Soo many honestly. One of the big ones for me is the multiple weight classes. In Battlebots you just get one heavyweight (250lb) league and nothing else, whereas in NHRL they have 3lb, 12lb, and 30lb leagues which all have incredibly different metas due to the different way things interact at different weight classes, for lack of better terms. For example, there's a type of bot called a \"meltybrain\" that basically spins the whole robot around its center and moves by stopping at specific times and sliding using the translational movement created by the gyroscopic procession of the bot (or something, me no physics good) and this doesn't work at all at higher weight classes due to the gyroscopic procession effecting the heavier bots significantly more. (Look up Project Liftoff for an example of this type of bot, one of my favs). Also flamethrowers recently have been doing extremely well in the 3lb class because a large amount of those bots are built out of various plastics for weight reasons, so a hot enough flame can literally melt the opponent. (See Dutch Oven vs Monkfish, or any Dutch Oven match really).\n\nTheir ruleset is also much more interesting imo. The aforementioned weight bonuses for various things are an obvious example, but there are also much less limitations (or possibly none, but fact check that) on things like weapon tip speed, or flamethrower heat, so you can still get the insane level of destruction you love to see from the heavyweights in the smaller weight classes (see Depth Charge vs James, absolute classic). And despite these things they maintain an incredibly high standard of safety for their audience (which unfortunately can't be said about all robot combat events, see Robogames and their multiple cage breaches over the last couple years) and will always stop the show to repair the cages or ventilate out smoke if need be to make sure nobody is ever in danger. \n\nAlso, while I love Battlebots, it is incredibly \"network-televisiony\" for lack of better terms and they'll play up beef between different teams or cut episodes/interviews in a way to paint drivers in a better or worse light because it makes better television, and NHRL largely sidesteps all of that and is entirely focused on the combat (although they still celebrate their builders quite a bit, and have plenty of interview sections and the like, they just don't have all the sensationalized drama that comes with being a network tv show). \n\nALSO I just really like the hosts and the overall warm atmosphere of the streams. Everyone seems so friendly and the community is so inclusive it makes it really easy to find yourself super invested. I plan on hopefully entering with a 3lb bot of my own sometime in the next couple years but I know dick all about electonics whatsoever so that will be a very uphill battle (and a costly one...)\n\n\nSorry for the disorganized collection of rambling run-on sentences. I'm on the tail end of a graveyard shift so I'm a bit delirious, and it's just a topic that gets me freewheel ranting. Hope those sold you though!\n\n\nTL;DR: everything, go watch NHRL.",
            "Huh, that\u2019s really cool! Part of me likes some of the battlebots showiness, it\u2019s like WWE but with actual death machines, but yeah it definitely feels forced/cringe at times instead of actual beef/distracts from the bots\n\nMaking a bot would be so cool.. I\u2019m sure the learning curve is huge but definitely rewarding! Any design types that call out to you? I\u2019ve always leaned towards the maneuverable designs that seek angles with one or two attack methods versus the tanks that have 3+ personally",
            "I've been nervous to say because I'm not sure if something exactly like this has ever been done so just in case \"this is my OC please don't steal xC\", or whatever. But anyways my idea is a bot that would use a similar mechanism to a hammer bot but sideways, so it would just smack the other bots (or more likely itself) around the arena. It definitely wouldn't win ever but I think it could make for some fun silly matches. For locomotion I'd probably just go with a simple two wheel drive design, maybe 4 if it needed the extra stability, nothing too fancy. Working title is \"The Batter\", but I might come up with something better. I think overall it would be simple enough for me to make as a builder starting from scratch, and hopefully distinct enough to stand out. I have a fun (in my biased opinion) gimmick I wanna do with the team that I won't get in to, but the theatre kid in me has been locked up too long.",
            "My lips are sealed btw, but I think that\u2019s a really cool and definitely a workable idea!!",
            "I haven\u2019t seen a side-mounted hammer before!! That\u2019d be interesting.. almost like a fusion of the traditional hammer and a spinner in that it\u2019d be looking more to knock around than crush. I can see your bot sliding around or jumping some with the force of a hammer cracking in, but if you have some kind of stop or a counterweight opposite the end of the hammers path, I think you might be able to alleviate some of that unintentional lift and translate the full force of your hammer swing into bouncing your opponent off the walls",
            "Thanks! It'll definitely take a lot of thought to figure out how (or if) I'll negate some of the unwanted forces mentioned in your other comment, but this will definitely be a loong endeavor if I every manage to make it materialize. Earliest I could see this being in NHRL (in the event I made something good enough to be accepted) would be the 2026 January New Bots event if they're still doing that, but I'd also have to participate in some local events before I even thought about that to get some experience and make sure things work properly. Fingers crossed it'll happen eventually though!",
