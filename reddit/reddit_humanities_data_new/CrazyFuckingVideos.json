            "Everything but shotguns and very very VERY old guns are rifled and spin. (Not trying to sound like an ass just thinking more) If you mean tumble? Then they both generally tumble as well, but a 5.56/.223 is a much longer bullet going much faster so the tumbling causes soooo much more damage and cavitation.",
            "Very bullet dependant. I think the only thing that would just stop would be a .22 because there is no copper jacket. Most everything else would bounce or deflect to some degree or another.",
            "I'm not saying bullets aren't bullets. I'm just saying I would rather take my chances with a .38 over an AK blasting my goofy ass multiple times.",
            "(Edit) I completely agree. A contact gunshot wound is waaay worse than overall getting shot.\n\nIt's a Wikipedia article, so take that how you will. Dude took over 37 hits. Bullets, bayonets, and explosive shrapnel. He's a Medal of Honor recipient for his service in 68. Dude was literally the Juggernaut lol. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Benavidez#:~:text=Benavidez%20had%20a%20total%20of,Center%2C%20where%20he%20eventually%20recovered.",
            "What's an Israeli bandage?",
            "I always heard that FMJ will tumble.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Wow. Crazy how he didn't almost get the MoH and then got the assist at the 11th hour. Thanks for the link, great story. We learned about all our USMC MoH winners in boot camp but not other branches.",
            "I think they don't call them that anymore, but it's a gauze bandage that has medication in it that helps clotting, to stop bleeds faster. Commonly used in IFAKs (Individual First Aid Kits) that attach to body armor for military. I also carry packing gauze and an Ace wrap, which is more useful 90% of the time than an Israeli bandage or Quik-Clot.",
            "Everything tumbles. Hollow points tumble, hard cast tumbles, ftx hollow points tumble, segmenting ammo segments then tumbles. It's really hard to push any straight through flesh at high speeds. \n\nMaybe a cannon ball or an APDS tank round won't tumble, but that's about it.",
            "Absolutely! Kinetic energy is measured as a square of velocity. KE=(1/2) mv^2 . So a .45 acp while being double the diameter and weighing 3-4 times as much as a 5.56mm, is moving at less than half the speed. So the wound would be much less traumatic with a .45 mainly cause of the cavitation. Shot placement plays a huge role as well, but from the same distance, I would much rather be shot with a .45.",
            "My favorite part of Roy's story is that you can read his story and go \"oh shit,\" then you see what he looks like and you immediately go \"Oh, that makes sense\"  lol. Dude looks like the kinda guy to get shot and still kick your ass."
