            "It sounds like you're having a problem wrapping your head around coding logic... tl;dr, practice til you make it. YouTube tutorials might be really nice here. A lot of the difference between the easy and medium problems doesn't come down to needing fancy syntax or needing to know all the possible commands... But rather being able to figure out how the logic needs to flow to achieve that result.\n\nYouTube tutorials are great for this. Go watch a \"how to code X\" for a project you can already do (If you're comfortable making a \"rock paper scissors\" game, then watch a video on how someone else does it). 90% of the material will be stuff you already know. The other 10% will be the really juicy stuff. And since you're already comfortable with the other 90%... It's going to be pretty easy to wrap your brain around that remaining 10%.\n\nLike to go back to that rock paper scissors example... Go try to code it. Now compare your result to this one I found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1dfcflv/comment/l8j6ddh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)... Simple project, this example doesn't use any crazy libraries or functions that you don't learn about in the first few weeks of Python... But the logic is fairly advanced.\n\n    import random\n    spr = ['scissors', 'paper', 'rock']\n    outcomes = [\"It's a draw\", \"You lose\", \"YOU WIN\"]\n    while input(f\"Wanna play {', '.join(spr[::-1])} ? \").lower() in ['y', 'yes']:\n        while (user := input(f\"Enter {spr} \").lower()) not in spr:\n            pass\n        bot = random.choice(spr)\n        print(f'Bot choose {bot}. {outcomes[spr.index(user) - spr.index(bot)]}')",
            "> range(0, 3+1) shd take 0,1,2,3\n\nCorrect, it does, as you can see:\n\n    >>> print(list(range(0, 3+1)))\n    [0, 1, 2, 3]\n\nSo you might be confused about what you get.  The code you linked to works perfectly.  You told the code you wanted 3 letters, 1 symbol and 4 numbers, and that is what you got.\n\nYour code is doing things like:\n\n    for letter in range(0, nr_letters):\n        password += random.choice(letters)\n\nSo the value in `letter` will be 0, 1, ..., nr_letters - 1 and you will add a letter to the `password` string `nr_letters` times, which is exactly what you need. If you want to do something N times you do `for i in range(N):` and `i` will have values 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1, which is N times because you **start at 0**.  Your `range(0, nr_letters)` is the same as `range(nr_letters)`.\n\n------\n\nNote that `letter` and the other names are not actually used in your loops and a common idiom to show that you don't use the loop variable in the loop is this:\n\n    for _ in range(6):\n        print(\"test\")\n\nwhich will print \"test\" 6 times.",
            "First of all, the world of CSV files is much wider than just the world of Excel. CSV files (.csv) are not excel files (.xls or .xlsx); CSVs are plaintext files. If you use a generic file-reading utility like Python's basic file reader, you can read the first few lines of a CSV:\n    \n    with open('the-filename.csv') as infile:\n        for line in infile:\n            print(line)\n\nwould show you its contents. (For an xlsx file, no).\n\n> I've never worked with this and can't seem to figure out how to, can anyone send me in the right direction? Would be much appreciated.\n\nYou'll know the incantations to do this by heart before too long, but for now just look up online the process for reading a CSV in Python. You're probably looking for solutions using the built-in `csv` module - it will save you a few headaches compared to just reading the file the way I did in my code sample above and manipulating it yourself. You also don't want to use `pandas` to do a simple CSV parse; that's kind of like rolling out an Abrams tank for your morning commute.",
            "Do whatever works for you.  An advanced programmer would use loops, but there are traps doing that if you use a lambda function for the `command=` optional parameters.  Why not write the hardcoded version first, get it working, and then try to use loops instead of hardcoding.  That's how you become advanced.",
            "Looping is the way to do it. Hard coding gets the job done for a small project like this but... It's not a good habit to get in to.\n\nWhy not do it both ways? Hard code it the first time through, that way you can get everything set up exactly how you like it and don't have to worry about any of the looping logic.\n\nThen after you get one hard coded that you like... Try to loop it instead. Try to get the final result to be identical to the one you hard coded to perfection.\n\nNow compare the two. Which one is longer? If you wanted to add more buttons and/or change your layout... Which one would it be easier to update? The better you get at *not* hard coding every little thing, the easier it becomes to do more and more things. Suddenly if you wanted a full scientific calculator with all the fancy buttons and modes... Do you really feel like hard coding 50-100 buttons individually?",
            "> ELI5\n\nSorry, the best I can do is \"Explain like you're a smart college sophomore.\"\n\nLambda functions are functions that are also expressions. This is special in Python because its standard functions are not expressions; they are written in *statements*. For example, you cannot do\n\n    f = def foo(x, y, z): return x * y + z # invalid syntax!\n\nYou have to declare `foo` inside its own statement block and then set `f` equal to `foo`.\n\nBy contrast, you can happily set `f` equal to a lambda expression.\n\n    f = lambda x, y, z: x * y + z # valid!\n\n---\n\nThis is kind of a misfit in Python - it's considered un-Pythonic to make your code too functional. But it's useful in some cases where the function that you're creating is very small. You've seen them in Tkinter, where it's common to bind a button to a very small function call. Another common example is the `key` kwarg in sorting or finding the min / max of a list.\n\nI can come up with more examples, but all of them qualify as [Python After Dark](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/14g9r0s/need_help_in_understanding_how_to_turn_a_string/jp4hklz/).",
            "A lambda function in python is just a way of writing a limited function that doesn't have a name, it's anonymous.  The body of the lambda function (the code) must be a single expression, and the value of the expression is the value returned by the lambda code.\n\nAs a simple example run this code:\n\n    test = lambda x, y: x + y\n    def test2(x, y):\n        return x + y\n    result = test(1, 2)    # call lambda function, pass 1 and 2\n    result2 = test2(1, 2)  # call \"real\" function, pass 1 and 2\n    print(f\"{result=}, {result2=}\")\n\nThe two functions, lambda and the `def` function, are identical and you could use either in your code.  Of course, assigning a lambda to a name misses the point of a lambda: it's an anonymous function.  Lambdas are useful for the `command=` optional parameters used in tkinter and the `key=` optional parameters for sorting, as well as many other places.  You can always use a `def` function instead of a lambda function, but the convenience of not having to think of a name to use and having the code right in the place you use it instead of a function somewhere else makes the lambda function useful.",

So you're never actually doing anything besides defining a function.\n\nIf you fix the indent, it prints 0. It's returning a value as well, but you're just calling the function, you're not doing anything with the returned value.\n\nTry this:\n\n    def cnt_vow(ord_input):\n        if not ord_input.isdigit():\n            count_vowels = 0\n            for i in ord_input:\n                if i in {\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"}:\n                    count_vowels += 1\n            return count_vowels\n        return \"Please enter an input with characters.\"\n    \n    result = cnt_vow(user_input := input(\"Please input a string: \"))\n    if type(result) == str:\n      print(result)\n    else:\n      print(f'There are {result} vowels in {user_input}')",

            "> my range was (0,N), it gave values (0,1,2,..N)\n\nNo.  You should really test these things.  Run this code:\n\n    N = 5\n    print(list(range(0, N)))\n    print(list(range(1, N)))\n\nand you get:\n\n    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n    [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nAs the doc says, the numbers range from the *start* value up to but not including the *stop* value, incrementing by the *step* value.  If not provided the *start* and *step* values are 0 and 1 respectively.\n\nIt's hard to say what your misunderstanding is and I probably didn't explain myself very well.  Some people, including myself, will write the `range()` code like this:\n\n    range(2, 5+1)\n\nto hint that the numbers produced will be 2, 3, 4, 5.  The range function doesn't include the stop value in its result, so writing `5+1` just emphasizes that the last number produced willl be 5.\n\nWhen you just want to do something N times you don't need to worry about the `+1` trick because `for i in range(0, N)` will execute the following code N times.  Sure, the values `i` will take are 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., N-1, but that is N numbers because the first value is zero.\n\nI also pointed out that `range(0, N)` is exactly the same as `range(N)` because the start value is assumed to be 0 if you don't supply it.",
            "Yup :) The easier way to do it would be just using the built in .count function for strings (could delete everything after `count_vowels = 0` and change the return to `return ord_input.count('a')+ord_input.count('e')+ord_input.count('i')+ord_input.count('o')+ord_input.count('u')`, but had a feeling you were learning for loops :) Or do something like this:\n\n    vowel_count = 0\n    for i in ['a','e','i','o','u']:\n      vowel_count += ord_input.count(i)\n    return vowel_count",

Once you learn that, it would be a breeze to learn different frameworks. Don't get me wrong, I am not that very good yet. But I am that stage that I could solve the problem with a little bit of time.\n\nWhat I really love with Andrei's course as well is he usually re-iterates that \"not everyone became a good programmer overnight\", \"stick with it\", \"practice and well get there\" phrases between his courses as if he assumes the course/topic is hard and the student following is a newbie. Not like other courses that just rushes the topic and doesn't even explain the foundations, why we do this and that etc.,",
