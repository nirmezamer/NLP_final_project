            "Only feedback I'll give about the game is that the food take minigame probably should be removed, or fundamentally redesigned.\n\nIt simply is a game of rote memorization that you learn from only by failing in the game. Since Destiny's food takes are kind of erratic (Waffles are a yes, eggs are a no, so someone trying to intuit putting breakfast food on the plate may fail) it just serves to frustrate anyone playing casually. \n\nWhile the idea is that ideally players will learn over successive attempts at that mini game, anyone not playing it for a few hours will only ever interface with it as being a coin toss at best (and have the entertainment value of a coin ross). Add in once we are out of demo territory and that minigame shows up way less often, and there are way less opportunities to learn? It'll just be not that great any time it shows up. \n\nEvery other minigame is pretty obvious, and a learning experience will only ever go one or two games deep (Realizing you can SAY IT now that Destiny is no longer white might not make sense on your first game, but it'll make sense on the second), but the food takes game kind of works against that. \n\nEverything else is pretty great so far, but if you don't find a way to redesign the food take game it's probably better to be taken out. On a game like that, it's probably better to lean more on it being an easy pass (ie, as long as you get one food take right, it's a W) than it being an easy L.",

Menu sounds akin to Holocure's are probably the best recent example i can think of as a default.   \nMaybe down the line add in some cute achievements style unlockables for skins, backgrounds, sound effects and the like if thats something you guys wanted to do. Something like destiny's love for arpeggio's would be cute, or ff7's menu sound effects or something akin to it, add in a gallery of some meme art if you can get into contact with some of the artists. There's a ton of things to pull from and im excited to see more of the game!",

She can be unhinged for drama but when it involves kids I think most people act more mature especially if they're public figures.\n\nIf it's inevitable he's gonna start streaming it's better its being done under the supervision of destiny and his mods rather than him being on his own. Forcibly keeping him away from streaming is like an actor keeping their kid away from acting.

If he wants to follow in his fathers footsteps he has a golden opportunity to jumpstart a career through his dad just like a child actor would do.\n\nYou say its up to his parents but clearly his parents seem to be ok with him trying it out no? But yeah I did say that they should heavily moderate away the weird behavior of chatters trying to be smart like using mrgirl names etc, but it seems like nathan has already watched a bunch of destiny videos at this point and is up to date with meme drama from dgg, Idk how destiny can protect him from that unless he removes his internet.\n\nWe all knew this day would come sooner or later, chatters have been asking for years when nathan will start streaming and mog his father. I think most kids would dream of becoming famous streamers as a career and when you have this opportunity it seems like a viable option unlike for 99% of them."

You can say it's still fucked up he'd want to bang an 18 year old, and that is fine to argue for, but the point is these are serious allegations that deserve someone wanting to ask a question.

Meeting up with someone under 18 you had previously sexted with but not explicitly planning a sexual rendezvous with them in California (Age of Consent is 18 there) is also, not itself, illegal.\n\nWhat makes this tricky is the word minor might be doing a lot of heavy lifting here.
