        "content": "I've seen this slogan in two main places.\n\n1. the OSR community, where I think it probably originated\n\n2. 5e discussion threads.\n\nIt has the opposite reactions based on the system we are discussing. Are we discussing a rules light OSR/NSR title like Stars Without Number with explicitly tells you that \"This sytem will not break if you add new rules to it, please feel free to change anything you don't like\" (sounds pretty rulings-not-rules to me) and any other rules light system that Doesn't Have a Rule For That, so the GM will have to make a ruling one way or another. This seems pretty accepted in the OSR community and I personally really like it.\n\n5e also has been attached to this idea, but here *it's received really negatively*. Is it seen as lazy on the part of the designers perhaps? Or is it that is slows down an already long combat encounter to bicker about how a spell or class ability should be interpreted? I've experienced both in 5e games I've played, and it's one of the reasons I really like rules light systems. Less bickering because there's only like 3 rules. You know as much as I do. \n\nAm I wrong about this double standard? Am I just misinterpreting or misremembering something?",

            "I think with 5E specifically, it's not that \"rulings not rules\" is bad, it's that 5E kind of wants to eat it's cake and have it too. It's just gritty enough that minor wording changes do actually matter Rules-As-Written (see weapon attack vs. attack with a weapon or whatever the precise distinction is) but is vague enough to make it seem like they don't Rules-As-Understood and Rules-As-Designers-Seem-To-Want-It-To-Be.\n\nFor what it's worth I think the system largely holds up fine run rulings-first (paladins should totally be able to smite barehanded) and that gripes are a bit overblown but I recognize that then I'm not technically running it rules as written. Either way that friction and poor communication on the part of the devs is still a design failing.",
            "I think the issue is that 5e isn\u2019t particularly rules light (though compared to 3/3.5\u2026) so the GM rulings can easily conflict with how the game is specifically meant to be played. Which is one of the quirks of 5e, it is designed to be played a certain way (I think it\u2019s 5 encounters an adventuring day?) otherwise its internalized balance falls apart rapidly. \n\nThis isn\u2019t as much of an issue in rule lite rpgs because they are designed(or Freeform enough) to allow different rules to be slotted in for edge case scenarios (like vehicle combat for example) which prevents someone from inadvertently breaking the game flow.",
            "It's really hard to play \"rulings over rules\" *and* have a system where a ton of different player options are supposed to be \"balanced\" against each other *and* there are supposed to be tools such as CR to help you easily build \"balanced\" encounters. The culture around 5e tends to value \"balance\" (whatever the hell that means), while OSR culture tends to reject \"balance\" and embrace the chaos.",
            "Some games (like Pathfinder) are rules-oriented. There is a ton of detail and a clear rule or two for just about everything. This lets a game with a high level of granularity be run consistently and fairly. High stakes are backed up by the knowledge that the GM isn't just winging the mechanics that get your PC killed.\n\nSome games (like most of the OSR) are rulings-oriented. There isn't much detail and there's a lot of room to make things up. This lets a game with a lower level of granularity be more approachable (less initial reading) and open to creative problem directly from the players, unfiltered (or minimally filtered) through mechanics. Some games are low-stakes, while higher-stakes games are very clear about the nature of their sometimes-arbitrary deadliness.\n\nDnD 5e doesn't fit either description. Instead, it is rules-*missing*. There are a lot of clear rules and a lot of detail in 5e. Spellcasting is extremely detailed and rigid, for example. But then it leaves a ton of uncharacteristic gaps. For example, there are no rules for how rope can be used to tie creatures up or climb, there's only a rule for snapping it with a Strength check. So sometimes the high stakes are backed up by the GM playing with consistent and fair rules, and sometimes they really aren't. To find a consistent play experience, either the GM needs to do a ton of extra work to make things rules-oriented, or the group needs to discard most of the existing rules to make things rulings-oriented. 5e itself accomplished neither, but still gets credit for both because it's the only ttrpg most people play.",
            "There is some additional information surrounding this statement. In one of the OSR blogs, they talk about the type of game you need for the OSR playstyle. One of the requirements is you need an \"Incomplete\" game. A game that has a good basic framework, but has lots of openings for rulings to be made. It can't have a lot of tightly interconnected rules, otherwise there is no room for rulings, they will also break other related abilities.\n\nThere is a great blog post  by Arnold K. on Goblin Punch, called \"Rulings not Rules is insufficient\" and it goes over that to make this work, it needs to be encouraged at all levels.\n\nHe gives an example of  a system that doesn't work:\n\nDM: \"Alright, you all manage to tread water for 18 hours, but the act was so exhausting that you've all lost all of your healing surges.\"\n\nPlayer: \"Wait, I can't use any of my class abilities without any healing surges.  In fact, I turn into a pumpkin without any healing surges.\"\n\nDM: \"Well, we've already established that exhaustion drains healing surges.  That's been a house rule for months.  And treading water for 18 hours is definitely exhausting.\"\n\nPlayer: \"But that was before I picked up the Pumpkin King prestige class.  It's unfair now.\"\n\nYou can read the whole article here:\n\n[https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/02/osr-style-challenges-rulings-not-rules.html](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/02/osr-style-challenges-rulings-not-rules.html)",
            "How is it a double standard?  The OSR and D&D 5e fanbases are very very different, even if there is significant overlap.  The two games demonstrate very different philosophies in the way they approach rules and what they expect from players/GMs.  \n\nThe reason people expect D&D 5e to be a complete experience out of the box is because that is exactly how WotC markets it.  The game is written such that it seems to have a rule for most things, so that makes it feel like it ought to have clear rule for *everything*.  \n\nOSR games, by contrast, are written under the assumption that the people playing the game are deep enough in the TTRPG hobby that they know what \"OSR\" means.  Such an audience is going to be much more comfortable with the idea of making up half the game as you go, and the lightly written rules support this idea.  \n\nIn other words, it's not a double standard, it's two vastly different groups of people having different reactions to the same phrase.",
            "Very interesting thread prompt, thanks for posting it.\n\n\n\"Rulings not rules\" at its core has a nice philosophy behind it. Some things are left vague or open to interpretation so that the game master and players can decide what something means when it comes to specific interactions or scenarios. This can be a good thing when handled well because it allows for flexibility in a game to fit different playstyles or intentions. OSR-type games, like Stars Without Numbers, tend to do this well and add some freedom to players and GMs to use their imaginations and flex the game a little to play to their preferences.\n\n\nThen we get to DnD 5e where it's a pejorative and I will be using 5e for this example because it's so derided and there's a lot to draw from. It is my belief that DnD 5e's claim/pseudoclaim of \"rulings not rules\" is taken badly *because it is a bold-faced lie* and I will explain why.\n\n\nFor 5e there's a lot in play that goes into that stew pot, one of them being a side effect that it's too big. Unlike other RPGs 5e has organized and sponsored play by its parent company which is called Adventure's League. How play is handled in Adventure's League is meant to be drop-in drop-out at any supporting game store and run by any game master. It's designed to be ultimately balanced and run on rails so you don't have someone like Pain McBleedEdge drop in with a Level 20 character with custom homebrew feats and a vorpal gunblade. As a result of this the rules __need__ to function in hosted games for Adventure's League in a uniform fashion to make things run smoothly. This fundamentally does not work with a \"rulings not rules\" approach because there is a defined correct ruling and every other ruling is wrong.\n\n\nThis is also compounded with another phenomenon of 5e's size and/or culture. It's the Sage Advice column. Sage Advice is a weird set up that's gone from FAQ to open forum when it shifted to Twitter and exists in an awkward grey area, but what Sage Advice is happens to be a platform where people who play the game can ask developers to clarify rules questions. This *can* be well and good and isn't inherently a bad thing but sends mixed signals. If the game approach is \"rulings not rules\" and you have a platform to ask the developers questions for their intended rulings, then it can invalidate the rulings other tables make because the rulings on Sage Advice can be seen as coming from an authority and that's often what happens when the game developers start making rulings not at your table which can be brought to your table with this authority as backing. Which of course sparks table arguments and also lends credence to the stance of \"rulings not rules, but only the right rulings\". \"Rulings not rules\" but the people who make the game are handing out ammunition against your rulings that are different from theirs. This all might sound like complaints and it would be if not for the fact that Sage Advice also releases errata, which are in fact defacto rules changes based on rulings made on the public forum. These are hard rules, not rulings. So now your rulings can be directly invalidated by the book itself. On occasion this is even really bad when the errata hits territory that should definitely be a ruling thing and not a hard rule, there was a change made to the way melee cantrips work with a feat that gained a lot of attention that way.\u00a0So \"rulings not rules until it isn't anymore\". The game master\u00a0has final say over what rulings take place at their tables but this ignores the fact that rules exist both ways to allow for players to have something to point to in their own defense and make an attempt at fair and intentioned play with a semblance of balance. It can't all be rulings, at that point you may as well play checkers, so what is invalidating a GM ruling and what isn't when the devs make a game adjustment with errata?\n\n\nThe final nail in the coffin harkens back to the rules themselves as well as Sage Advice, and that's a lack of confidence and resources. It's gone on record (usually on Twitter) for Sage Advice that on occasion different developers will give different answers to the FAQ material brought to them or will insufficiently answer questions about it, or contradict written material or change it (people in the 5e space drag Jeremy Crawford through the mud because he's particularly bad at this). Combine that the lack of context in the given rules and it becomes apparent that some rules aren't vague because the intent is you have the freedom to make your own judgement call on them as rulings, but is instead because the rules don't work, aren't clear, have a clear correct ruling that isn't stated because they were written poorly, or were poorly implemented. As an example in 5e nobody has any idea if you can attack while jumping or not and that's not a case of \"it's left vague to allow the GM to decide\", it's a case of \"the rules contradict anything that speaks on whether or not it's allowed\". Here the game master isn't making a ruling based on the philosophy of \"rulings not rules\" in that they have freedom to play the game how they like, they're making a ruling to fix a broken mechanic which never functioned on release. And 5e is absolutely rife with these. Like with Challenge Rating, or CR, which is there to act as a guideline for the game master to decide how challenged their players are in fights and how much effort and risk they'll present. CR doesn't work all that well and completely breaks down at some levels of play. A \"ruling not rule\" of CR as intended would allow for the GM to adjust for more powerful or weaker characters but still act as a guideline, but instead it must have rulings made because it does not funtion as a proper guideline in the first place. When all these rulings that must take place to fix broken mechanics adds up it gives the impression that the developers endorsed the \"rulings not rules\" style not out of advocating for freedom of play but instead to cover up their nonfunctioning mechanics and trick game masters into fixing things for them, and doing so creates a lot of extra work for the game master. Instead of empowering play it's an apparent excuse for laziness and poor game design.\n\n\nAnd that's why I think it's ridiculed. In by far the most popular TTRPG the claim of \"rulings not rules\" is very much not held to the spirit of that philosophy and is\u00a0 implemented in a way that's poor at best and an outright false claim at worst.",
            "In 5e's case there's more of a culture clash between old school and new age, and that's a small part of why you get the different reaction. Old school D&D was used to the rulings not rules process, where as a lot of new age D&D players were half being introduced to it for their first time in 5e and 5e also stopped committing to it midway through the edition/development.\n\nWhen the PHB was written, it was with a more naturalist language focus and with an understanding of rulings not rules/reason being applied. However a lot of that naturalist language has been shifted in its understanding to be used as gamist language when it wasn't written as such. It's why there's a meaningful difference between *\"Melee weapon attack\"* and *\"attack with a melee weapon.\"* and why through a very strict interpretation of RAW that the current lead designer has clarified to be the correct interpretation *\"True seeing doesn't shut off the disadvantage on attacks against invisible creatures from the invisibility spells, it only lets you see the creature.\"* It's obvious what the intent was in the latter example, but now that it's being viewed in a phrase to code like manner, things fall apart more. (Also makes 5e seem more borked than it is if you wanna sell revisions to the books for an anniversary.)\n\nAnother cause of the frustration in 5e are also a few DM's that are pretty bad or ass hats about certain stuff, and abuse rule zero for their lack of understanding, rather than fair or reasonable rulings. These are often the types who put more stock into a features name than its rules text and make some pretty heinous calls such as *\"you need to be hidden to sneak attack\"* and such. The rules are incredibly clear that it's not the intended case but *\"hurr durr it says sneak\"* (and not understanding the full range of meaning of the word sneak) leads to bad calls by these fellows. This isn't exclusive to 5e, but 5e suffers it a lot likely due to the scope and scale of its rules compared to some simpler OSR entries.\n\nI would also say that a lot, but certainly not all, of the OSR/NSR games I play are more of a complete package and empowers the DM with additional tools, resources, and guidelines and the reasoning behind them, than most of the 5e content I come across. Worlds Without Number as an example offers a much more complete system than the 5e PHB (and 5e with a good amount of the supplements included) in my experience and explains the *\"why it is suggested you do it this way\"* much better than 5e has.\n\n5e is also much more focused on *\"balance\"* than old school games. 5e was designed with a very strict flow of an adventuring day in mind. 6-8 medium difficulty resource draining encounters per long rest, with two to three short rests in between. (you can use less encounters that are higher in difficulty or ore that are easier, but thats the base assumption.) If you're not providing that properly for you players, things can fall apart and the way a lot of people seem to want to run the game doesn't line up with this expectation. \n\nMany OSR games don't have this strict expectation and approach things more loose. They also have a different assumption of livability and approaching these encounters. Making a saving throw in 5e is often viewed as a normal and expected occurrence, whereas making one in many OSR games means you failed to avoid the danger and are suffering the consequences harshly. There's A LOT that could be said about these nuances, andd many who can explain them better than I could, but there's very different expectations between the two in this regard.",
            "The issue is that with OSR (like you said) they are already rules-light so you're not likely to break anything. If anything it's encouraged. The game leaves space for you to fill up with your own rules/ perspective that help you run the game. You can play most OSR games in like 5 minutes, including the time it creates to explain rules + make a character.\n\nMeanwhile 5e has entire books full of rules, but when the time comes to actually commit to something they're like \"oh, just do whatever you like :)\", which is unhelpfull because it'll \n\n1. react to other already existing rules and \n2. you're not buying 5e for the rules light OSR experience. You're buying it because you want clear rules.\n\n5e throws you a box of tools, and then lets you figure out how to use them and what they're for. That doesn't work with how many rules it's throwing at you. They want you to think of creative solutions, but if you do that, you unintentionally end up breaking so much of that game that it's just frustrating to play.\n\nThe best comparison is looking at 5e compared to pf2e. Pf2e has a shit ton of rules, but they're all clear. Everyone knows what's going on, and it allows you to think more creatively than dnd because instead of thinking/ ruling outside of the box pf2e has made the box fucking huge so anything you think of fits in there.\n\nThe best example imo intimidate in 5e/ demoralize in pf2e\n\nDemoralize is incredibly clear, you're trying to do a clear thing and you know the effect\n\nin pf2e it is\n\n>\"dm I want to demoralize that guy\"  \n\"okay, it succeeds he's now frightened\"  \n\n\nin dnd, you inherently might want to do a similar thing because you have a skill that says \"intimidate\", but there's no actual rules. So then it ends up being this annoying back and forth where the DM has to balance it on the fly, and hope it's not too strong because then it'll get abused in every combat in the future, so it looks like\n\n>\"dm can I intimidate that guy?\"  \n\"uh sure what do you want to do?\"  \n\"well I'm hoping he'll get scared and run away\"   \n\"No that's a bit too much for intimidate, he'll be scared of you but he can't just run away from his job\"  \n\"Can I intimidate him into focusing on me or something? Cause I'm a threat now\"  \n\"Uh, yea that should be fine I think\"  \n\"did that count as an action or just a bonus action?\"  \n\"oh well I think it's an action cause you had to roll dice for it\"  \n\"yea okay, that's my turn then\"",
            "While there are other reasons I think much of the negative reaction to rulings not rules comes from D&D's push for perceived balance (CR) and uniformity (Adventurer's guild, virtual table tops, a culture that expects rules and the game world to work the same between different games) that doesn't exist in the OSR and related games.",
            "Good question, I hadn't considered other interpretations of this phrase.  To me it is saying that during play you should prefer rulings over rules.  If something is too esoteric to remember and needs to be looked up on occasion that seems okay, but if its one of those common but grey area situations, don't sweat over the rules and make a ruling.  It's fantastical sometimes you break the rules without even meaning to.  I think another way of saying it is Flow over Fluency.",
            "5E has a lot of front-loaded choices that are easily undermined by just making shit up in the middle of the game. An end-run around the RAW robs players of the agency that they were expressing when they made those choices.",
            "Whatever game you're playing is only [that game] because of the rules it's defined by.  If you use a basketball+bball court to play dodgeball, you're not playing basketball anymore\u2014which is fine, so long as the people playing all understand the purpose of the group is to play dodgeball.\n\nIf I sign up to play [rpg] it's because I like the rules that define that game.  If the rules are whatever the GM wants them to be, it's not [rpg] anymore; it's [whatever the GM feels like].  You can't sign me up for that, because I have no idea what [rpg] rules will be discarded before it happens.\n\nI started with AD&D; in an OSR environment it has to be rulings-not-rules because there aren't rules for anything except a very basic set for combat.   If you sign up for an OSR game, you know it has to be [whatever the GM feels like] because there's no rules for most gameplay.",
            "OSR is basically a collection of house rules and house rulings for old editions of D&D, grafted onto whichever run of new adventure modules the GM's table likes.\n\nSo it gets away with it based on a table culture that doesn't particularly care about written rules to begin with (as table style and established procedures tend to be much more important).",
            "I think a lot of it here is that in my experience of OSR people don't \\*actually\\* change core rules that much. They add new stuff and they make up rulings to cover what isn't there, but there's not often that many core changes in most games.  (Some people in the OSR space are starting to use \"rulings are rules\" to highlight that different).\n\n  \nWhereas with 5e it feels like it's saying to change rules that are already there, which is much riskier in a game of that level of rules complexity.  Without really knowing what you're doing, it risks unintended conseqences.  Which makes it especially bad advice for new DMs.  And I think it's probably fair to say that 5e is going to be getting a lot more people new to DMing than an OSR game is.\n\n  \nSo very different target demographics, which makes the advice play out different.",
            "it's because 5e is actually an OSR game at heart, just one with a lot of bloat to appease the 3.x fans, and the broader hobby outside OSR doesn't actually like this rules style",
            "Any rule set are guidelines not cast in stone.",
            "Rulings not rules means the GM is god. Many RPGs have moved or are moving away from that, including D&D, for the last 24 years.",
            "\"Rulings not rules\" work in playerfirst games where characters are more placeholders for a few and narratively interesting attributes, but the game is mainly played between the GM and the players as they create the story collaboratively. Having consistent rules is not imperative as situations and drama dictate the rulings needed, not the characters, the game world, or any governing persistent mechanics and/or boundaries.\n\nIn characterfirst games where the game is focused on what the characters do in the gameworld, and the actions taken by the characters are governed by a persistent world with enduring confines and boundaries, rules are much more important as it governs the capbilities and therefore available actions for the character. The player inpu is informed - and limited - by a common collective of rules and expectations.\n\nD&D5e is not a very strong narrative TTRPG and due to the rather flimsy rules complex compared to for instance D&D4e and D&D3(.5), you will often still end up with rules questions during play. Without consistent answers, the rules become even less dependable, making for a continously worsening game experience.",
            "The difference is it's a mindset. Players that roleplay see rulings over rules as something that can be used. They can roleplay a situation to benefit them and have a say to influence a ruling. \n\n5e players are a different breed. They tend to be rollplayers. They want hard rules they can argue and can be identified by their use of \"builds\" when they refer to characters. True roleplaying is not what they see as fun. \n\nThis is why real roleplayers don't see the issue as 5e the issue is the culture of the players base that is the real issue.",
            "I think another element is that 5E just has enough rules that they either get in the way of interesting rulings, or set an annoying precedent.\n\nAs my favorite example of this, look at Heat Metal.  You cast the spell, and a metal object begins to glow red-hot.  There's plenty of interesting and creative stuff players could get up to with that description (cast it on a pan to cook with, stab a monster with a metal spear and heat it, start a fire to burn down a castle gate, etc.).  However, the remaining 2/3rds of the text is all combat rules - damage, bonus actions, saving throws, etc.  Like, RAW whoever is cooking with Heat Metal takes damage, and technically could cause more with a bonus action.\n\nIt wants to have light descriptions that give players room to come up with creative uses, but also wants the spell to be a viable damage option in combat, and those two don't gel together in the writing.",
            "You've summarized this perfectly.\n\nI first felt the pain of this granular (but also flexible) design when I had to explain that the oversized weapon rules do not in fact matter when the rune knight increases size. Those rules are there for cool flavor and to have a baseline that's all that's intended, but 5e requires you to clarify where that distinction is with far too many rules (optional or otherwise) for it to be a sleek system OR a system with in depth balancing. That distinction is going to be different from group to group, let alone individual players.\n\nIt's having it's cake and eating it too. I have a feeling that this is just going to get worse with the 2014 v 2024 PHB \"backwards compatibility\"",
            "also worth mentioning that half of the unclear rules have been answered by crowford on twitter",
            "The adventuring day thing is a really good example. It's not well communicated but so central to balance. The game still works if you ignore it but if I could change one thing about 5E, it'd be revamping the rest system to work better with non-standard adventures.",
            "In particular, 5e is a \"character build\" game, where a major part of the game is selecting features and special abilities to design a character's build. This is the core part of strategy in combat - you essentially arrange your tactics in advance when you level up. This means that a ruling can completely undermine or unbalance an entire character concept. If you decide you want to simplify the rules about stealth and sneak attacks, in a non \"character build\" game, then that just affects whether players choose to sneak and what effect it has. But in a \"character build\" game like D&D, a player might have designed their entire character around sneaking, and modifying how that works would utterly change their character and their effectiveness.\n\nI'd contrast this with Traveller, which can get really really crunchy if you want to dive into the details, particularly in some editions. But because the game isn't very sensitive to character builds, it doesn't really matter that much if you cut out lots of rules and make your own calls instead.\n\nSo it's partially a \"rules light\" vs \"rules heavy\" thing, but I think in particular it's because the D&D rules are so focused on character builds.",
            "My experience is that the system can take a lot of abuse as long as you don't touch a few key pillars like Concentration. Many older players did start with 3.5, and the loudest push back I see online comes from them, or at least those that didn't migrate to Pathfinder. For those people that grew up with thick books full of edge cases, \"rulings not rules\" sounds like the developers renouncing on their responsibility.",
            "I think this is a solid point. There are a lot of really fun ttrpgs where they explicitly avoid balance. They also have better rules than 5e and eschew \"rulings versus rules\" wishywashyness\n\nAnd the games that do \"rulings instead of rules\" well generally lean in making the rules lightweight so a GM cannot trip themselves up making rulings.",
            "Excellent description. Ironically, in PF2e, because the logic of rules are applied so consistently, it's fairly easy to make a ruling in the game if you can't bothered to look it up at the table -- and often you'll get it right.\n\nOnce you're familiar with the rules, rulings are a snap.",

            "Nah, 5e is a game designed during a time when the designers were trying to appeal to OSR gamers - so there are all sorts of half-nods towards that playstyle - but it isn't an OSR game. It's fundamentally in the same vein as all of the other WotC D&Ds - a tactical combat character builder with some role playing and exploration between combats.\n\n\nAnd to be clear, I'm not knocking that. I'm playing in a 4e game right now and having an absolute ball. But it isn't the same style as the old school style, not even a little bit.",

It has flaws and we prefer other games sure but that doesnt make 5e players a \\`\\`different breed\\`\\`. They are playing accordingly to the game they are playing and i have seen more roleplayers than \\`\\`rollplayers\\`\\` in 5e.\n\nStop with the \\`\\`real roleplayers\\`\\` gatekeeping.

So the table either gets to pause as we google to see or gets bogged down in litigation.",
            "I shouldn't have to go to fucking Twitter to get rules. It should be on the website as errata or something like that. Or 5e could have better rules.",
            "I mean even the Sage Advice is just non-sensical. When they try to clarify on somatic components:\n\n> If a spell has a somatic component, you can use the hand that performs the somatic component to also handle the material component.\n\nOkay, so you have chosen a hand to perform the somatic component. You may then also use that hand for the material component. Makes sense since a hand for somatic is rather free so it can also touch holy symbols, orbs, or grab stuff from material pouches.\n\n> For example, a wizard who uses an orb as a spellcasting focus could hold a quarterstaff in one hand and the orb in the other, and he could cast lightning bolt by using the orb as the spell\u2019s material component and the orb hand to perform the spell\u2019s somatic component.\n\nSure, bit backwards reasoning at th eend. Surely, because he has a hand free for the somatic component, he can also use that hand for the material component like you said above.\n\n> Another example: a cleric\u2019s holy symbol is emblazoned on her shield. She likes to wade into melee combat with a mace in one hand and a shield in the other. She uses the holy symbol as her spellcasting focus, so she needs to have the shield in hand when she casts a cleric spell that has a material component.\n\nOkay, so no hands free for somatic component. Okay, the holy symbol is on the shield, so the shield satisfies the criteria for material component. But yeah you can't handle somatic components.\n\n> If the spell, such as aid, also has a somatic component, she can perform that component with the shield hand and keep holding the mace in the other.\n\nWTF? How can she perform somatic components? She is holding a shield and a weapon. You told me in the beginning that \"I can use the hand that performs somatic component to also handle the material component\", not the other way around.\n\nOkay, so a hand suitable for somatic component can also be used for material component.\nAnd, a hand suitable for material component can also be used for somatic components. \n\n> If the same cleric casts cure wounds, she needs to put the mace or the shield away, because that spell doesn\u2019t have a material component but does have a somatic component. She\u2019s going to need a free hand to make the spell\u2019s gestures.\n\nWTF. You just told me that someone using a shield can use that hand to perform somatic components! That doesn't make any sense.\n\nIf the casting of material components always allows use of the same hand for somatic (which is still opposite of the first sentence) that essentially implies that all (V)SM spells can be cast as (V)M. Then you can safely remove and errata all somatic components from all spells that have material components instead of this non-sensical ruling that a lesser mobile hand already busy with materials is also suitable for somatics.",
            "Totally my dude, it\u2019s one of my least favorite parts of 5e, I actually really enjoy your answer to OP\u2019s question better than mine. 5e works as along as you don\u2019t look too closely at the paint on it, it just doesn\u2019t hold up over millions of different games where the players compare outcomes.",

So it's actually a really big job and will annoy a lot of the existing player base who will feel nerfed.",
            "IMO the  \"adventuring day\" economy is by far the most broken aspect of 5e.\n\nNone of the other issues people complain about in 5e has ever particularly gotten in the way- outside of just \"its really lame that I missed here\" moments that happen in any trad TTRPG. But the adventuring day has never lined up with how any group I've played with wants to play",
            "I really think this is at the heart of it.",
            "There is an objective answer: no, because warforged are creatures, not objects. Things that affect objects do not affect creatures and vice versa. Which is why eldritch blast can be used to detect mimics.

Crawford's (non-binding) stance is that manipulating a material component *counts as the entire somatic component,* and that manipulating a focus is the exact same thing as manipulating a material component.\n\nThis is definitely one of the examples of why I dislike Sage Advice. It's never about trying to clarify intent, and always about Crawford trying to find the most reasonable RAW reading of the text, *despite ostensibly having the authority to provide RAI.* It's a baffling approach.",
            "It's frustrating, because it's *so close*. I remember being really excited at the playtests when it first came out. I still think it's good overall, but I wish the devs had a bit more of a focused vision (and the gumption to really kill some sacred cows).",
            "I've used those variants before (as well as a homebrew in a wilderness exploration game where you could only long rest in a civilized building).

            "> in line with what a very large proportion of players actually want, which is one combat per long rest\n\nIs this a common preference? That sounds batty to me - but I left 5e long ago so maybe I'm not up on the preferences of its playerbase.",
            "> But the adventuring day has never lined up with how any group I've played with wants to play\n\nYou share this in common with most actually existing players of 5e (and earlier versions too). Most people haven't actually used D&D for pure dungeon crawling (which is the only situation where the 5e adventuring day makes sense) since the early 1980s.\n\nMy read of why 5e nevertheless went with this is:\n\n-Mike Mearls has terrible taste in people and hung out with the early OSR guys and thought that was the next big thing, even though with hindsight every single OSR influenced change the designers made to 5e made it a worse game apart from a general \"rulings not rules\" mood, which is arguably fair enough for an on-ramp game. This is totally unsurprising as what OSR fans want (easy character death, simple character builds, dungeon crawling, random tables, player skill not character skill) is diametrically opposed to what the largest single audience for 5e wants (no lethality, complicated character builds, heroic adventures with a story attached, substantial character skill and character development).\n\n-D&D, like all RPGs, needs people to teach others how to play. The designers were worried that the grognards who knew how RPGs work would not learn 5e and so be a bottleneck preventing players picking it up, so they pandered to the grognards at the expense of the bulk of their potential player base.",
            "It\u2019s not actually as clear as you would think. The Integrated Protection ability in 5e states that the warforged enhance their defences by incorporating armour into their bodies. If you made the ruling that the armor still exists it could still be targeted by Heat Metal. And given that Exploring Eberron has a racial feat for warforged which lets them ignore unwanted effects which target their armor, specifically listing Heat Metal as an example, that seems like a reasonable interpretation.",
            "wait how's that eldritch blast thing work? you just go around trying to blast everything and it only works if it's a mimic?",

            "Honestly encounter powers in 4e were a good idea but just executed poorly, I feel like that would have made balance easier in 5e.",
            "Yes, exactly. I feel bad for the designers of D&D honestly - they're trying to satisfy a player base with multiple different and mutually exclusive preferences, as well as a legacy that they don't want to move away from. No wonder 5e is such a cludge.",
            "According to [this poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/s/YvLUCTXBak) on dndnext, more than half of respondents ran no more than 2 combats per long rest. And frankly it fits with how D&D has actually been used in practice since the days of Dragonlance officially, and earlier unofficially. Most people do not use D&D for dungeon crawling - they use it for heroic adventures.",
            "Nothing you just said muddied the water.\n\nUsing Heat Metal on a Warforged with incorporated armor affects them just the same as a \"normal\" character wearing armor. The fact that it takes an hour to un-integrate doesn't matter because the length of time to doff armor regularly far exceeds the typical length of a full combat scenario.\n\nAllowing incorporated armor to be targeted simply makes sense because the Warforged can un-integrate that armor as they please. It subsequently still exists as an object.",
            "Haha yep if you come across a chest you should always attempt to blast it before you touch it. If the spell doesn't work (or if the DM rules it works but does no damage, and that happens) you know it's a mimic. \n\nKinda dumb, huh? That's 5e for you. As someone else said upthread, it's trying to have it's cake and eat it too. Unfortunately it achieves neither.",
            "My perspective is *Mage: The Sorcerers Crusade* where *heat metal* always means \"heat metal\". To have to wade through the minutiae of the wording of the spell and decipher *D&D*-specific meanings of otherwise English words is jarring.",

            "That's revisionist/hater perspective history about Pathfinder and is basically entirely nonsense. Paizo didn't make money off of 3.75 because people hated 4e, they made money off of 3.75 because WotC tried to pull the OGL fiasco all the way back then: 4e's license meant that 3rd party content could not exist for 4e like it did for 3.5, and Paizo as a company existed solely to make content for 3.5. So They made Pathfinder, and all other 3rd party content creators for 3.5 hopped onto the Pathfinder bandwagon.\n\n5e then went back to the OGL, 3rd party could exist again, and everyone went back to making D&D content because Hasbro and the sheer market value of D&D makes everyone look bad in comparison. Aaaaand then history almost repeated itself, but not quite.",
            "Not the person you were replying to, but my problem with 4E's combat rules in *general* is that it's too defined.  Sounds like an odd complaint given the topic of the post, but it does tie in to it.\n\nSo in 4E, you have a lot of options in terms of powers to take, and each power does specific things.  For a tactical wargame or board game, that's great.  But, for me, when a TTRPG gets as defined as 4E does, it limits possibilities.  Basically, if I, as a player, want to try something that isn't codified, the powers that *are* codified hypothetically limit what my actions can accomplish so as not to let a player step on the toes of an existing power with an improvised action.  This is a problem with WotC D&D in general, but from my own experience with it, 4E runs into this the most for the very reason that 4E fans like it: it's a very tightly designed combat engine.\n\nAs for encounter powers specifically (though it also applies to daily powers), it's that I can't see a satisfying in-fiction explanation for their limitations, both prescriptive (why they do a hyper specific thing and can't be used in different ways) and in terms of use (what is it that limits a fighter to using a certain power a certain number of times per encounter or day).  In my opinion, 4E, more than any other edition, sacrifices the feel of the game for the mechanics of it.  It's not the only flawed edition (they all have their quirks), but it's the one that is most flawed such that gets in the way of my own personal enjoyment of the game.",
            "Honestly the encounter system itself feels artificial, cantrips are a good stopgap with that since they are always available (yes I know they were in 3&4e) so it doesn\u2019t feel artificial. I\u2019ve never been a huge fan of the spell slot system though so maybe it\u2019s just me."

It was full of names and dates. They've spent a while trying to work out if there was any meaning to them. I have so far:\n\n- Given them information on their analysis without having them roll, if I'm telling them something this way its my usual sign to them that there isn't anything hidden in any sense.\n\n- Repeatedly used the phrase 'Little Black Book'\n\n- Told them that there's no pattern to names or dates, some appear more frequently, the last to appear more frequently was the same name as the nobles mistress.\n\n- Someone they met had had a one night stand with the noble, and their name was in the book, with a date that matched the time period described by the NPC.\n\nI just thought this would be window dressing, giving a bit of colour to an icky guy with a high sex drive. I don't think I could have been any clearer beyond saying 'folks, this just looks like a list of people he's boinked'.

The best time to do that would\u2019ve been during play while they\u2019re asking questions about it. When it\u2019s throwaway stuff like that, I often just pick the character with a vaguely relevant background/vibe and tell them \u201cyeah this is almost certainly blackmail or something similar.\u201d The second best time is now, before next session.\n\nIt\u2019s totally fine to be direct and just tell your players what something is, especially when they seem like they\u2019re about to spend a lot of time trying to figure that something out when it\u2019s not actually a big deal. We don\u2019t live in our characters\u2019 worlds so they would make inferences that we don\u2019t.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1dl9ofn/exploring_my_stigma_against_5e/",
        "content": "A recent post  prompted me to dig into my own stigma against 5e. I believe understanding the roots of our opinions can be important \u2014 I sometimes find I have acted irrationally because a belief has become tacit knowledge, rather than something I still understand.\n\nI got into tabletop role-playing games during the pandemic and, like many both before and after me, thought that meant Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). More specifically, D&D 5th Edition (5e). I was fascinated by the hobby \u2014 but, as I traveled further down the rabbit hole, I was also disturbed by some of my observations. Some examples:\n\n1. The digital formats of the game were locked to specific, proprietary platforms (D&D Beyond, Roll20, Fantasy Grounds, etc.).\n2. There were a tonne of smart people on the internet sharing how to improve your experience at the table, with a lot of this advice specific to game mastering (GMing), building better encounters, and designing adventures that gave the players agency. However, this advice never seemed to reach WOTC. They continued to print rail-roady adventures, and failed to provide better tools for encounter design. They weren't learning from their player-base, at least not to the extent I would have liked to see.\n3. The quality of the content that Wizards of the Coast (WOTC) did produce seemed at odds with the incentives in place to print lots of new content quickly, and to make newer content more desirable than older content (e.g. power creep).\n4. There seemed to be a lot of fear in the community about what a new edition would bring. Leftover sentiments from a time before my own involvement, when WOTC had burned bridges with many members of the community in an effort to shed the open nature of their system. Little did I know at the time the foreshadowing this represented. Even though many of the most loved mechanics of 5e were borrowed from completely different role-playing games that came before it, WOTC was unable to continue iterating on this game that so many loved, because the community didn't trust them to do so.\n\nI'm sure there are other notes buried in my memory someplace, but these were some of the primary warning flags that garnered my attention during that first year or two. And after reflecting on this in the present, I saw a pattern that previously eluded me. None of these issues were directly about D&D 5e. They all stemmed from Wizards of the Coast (WOTC). And now I recognize the root of my stigma. **I believe that Wizards of the Coast has been a bad steward of D&D.** That's it. It's not because it's a terrible system, I don't think it is. Its intent of high powered heroic fantasy may not appeal to me, but it's clear it **does** appeal to many people, and it **can** be a good system for that. However \u2014 I also believe that it is easier for a lot of other systems, even those with the same intent, to play better at the table. There are so many tabletop role-playing games that are a labor of love, with stewards that actively care about the game they built, and just want to see them shine as brightly as they can. And that's why I'll never run another game of 5e, not because the system is inherently flawed, but because I don't trust WOTC to be a good steward of the hobby I love.\n\nSo why does this matter? Well, I'm embarrassed to say I haven't always been the most considerate when voicing my own sentiments about 5e. For many people, 5e **is** role-playing. Pointing out it's flaws and insisting they would have more fun in another system is a direct assault on their hobby. 5e doesn't have to be bad for me to have fun playing the games I enjoy. I can just invite them to the table, and highlight what is cool about the game I want to run. If they want to join, great! If not, oh well! There are plenty of fish in the sea.\n\nIn the same vein, I would ask 5e players to understand that lesson too. I know I'm tired of my weekly group referring to my table as \"D&D\".\n\nI'd love to see some healthy discussion, but please don't let this devolve into bashing systems, particularly 5e. Feel free to correct any of my criticisms of WOTC, but please don't feel the need to argue my point that 5e can be a good system \u2014 I don't think that will be helpful for those who like the system. You shouldn't need to hate 5e to like other games.",

            "To play Devil's Advocate re: WotC being a bad steward... the only other owner of the IP was TSR, and they basically went out of business. \n\nD&D is very cyclical, even back to TSR days but the cycle is much more noticable post-millennium with heavier internet usage etc:\n\nNew edition releases, people mostly love it and some old guard hate it, and it rolls out releases over years and becomes bloated and unwieldy. Rinse, repeat. \n\nWotC has put out a lot of great stuff for D&D over the years- the 3.Xe era was fantastic- we got Red Hand of Doom, the website was full of free stuff ... I'm inserting my own bias when I say that things really only started going downhill when Hasbro started paying attention to D&D in the late 2010's. That's when the \"stewardship\" of D&D went bad- lots of leadership was moved out, designers churned (designers always churn but they lost some particularly good folks) and ... yeah. \n\nI just don't think it's fair to say that WotC has been a bad steward the entire time. A company is made up of the people who work there, and it had a lot of good people making decisions and products on and off for a long time.\n\n**I really just hate what it's become now- and a lot of that is exemplified by the DnDBeyond walled garden.** It's always possible that the cycle will begin anew, but we're a decade into 5e/5.Xe and that's the longest lifetime of any edition- and Hasbro's still trying to figure out how it can make a ton of money off of the IP.",
            "I mean my issue with 5e isn't the game itself. It's fine. It is however one rpg out of the tens of thousands available and it is often badly shoehorned into being a game it is not. If you want heroic fantasy with setpiece miniature combat then awesome it's there for you. If someone invites me to a table I'm happy to play. \n\nBut I find other games do D&D better than D&D and more often than not, I want something with more interesting themes rules and roleplay.",
            "In many ways, for me 5e (and D&D in general) is like good fast food - when I open the box I know what I'm getting and there is honestly some comfort in that.  It's a fine way to sit around with my friends tossing dice, telling \"no shit there I was stories\" and killing imaginary monsters.  \n\nWe also play and enjoy a lot of other games and I mean a lot...I currently run Call of Cthulhu, Forbidden Lands, Dragonbane, Scum and Villainy, Marvel Multiverse (while our Star Trek game is on pause), PF2e and Fallout 2d20 and play in two 5e games, a PF2e game and a Torg Eternity game. When I go to a convention I'm going to play things I've never had the chance to and I'm going to run games I think deserve a bigger audience.\n\nWhat 5e is very, very good at is getting people into the hobby due to market dominance.  If we (collectively) slam the door on those newcomers by insulting the thing that brought them into gaming we're not doing the overall hobby any favours.  Instead of saying \"5e sucks, PF2e is vastly superior\" we can say things like \"If you like 5e here's another heroic fantasy style game you might like\".  Instead of \"ugh fantasy...\" we can say \"there's lot of games out there in other genres...\" and direct them to Call of Cthulhu or Mothership or Good Society or Traveler etc.",
            "It's good to examine our thoughts and opinions, even challenge them, from time to time. I keep trying (unsuccessfully sadly) to get PbtA games for example. My view on D&D is pretty uninvolved though. I does what it means to well enough. I'll by cores and play when offered if that is what the group is in to. There are other games I prefer though, and while I generally don't worry too much about the business side of things, to say WotC/Hasbro seem blind to how they are affecting their fan base seems...both an understatement and, paradoxically, somehow not an issue.\n\nBut in the end, all I can do is spend money on the things that seem interesting to me and play the games I find fun.",
            "People may hate to hear this, but as a community we're probably lucky WotC grabbed the DnD brand as opposed to almost anyone else. DnD was dead when they plucked it from the smoldering corpse of TSR. It was not, and really never has been in the business sense, a particularly great investment. It may be the giant among TTRPGs, but it's still chump change when you step back and look at the broader gaming industry. The husk of DnD could have just been a video game property, and TTRPGs might have faded into obscurity, killed by video games if it weren't for a newly rich CEO with a fondness for the game.\n\nOverall, WotC has comported themseves far better than TSR ever did for those that remember, missteps and all. They treat their employees and players much better. As far as gaming companies go, WotC is far more responsive to player concerns than say Bethesda or EA.\n\nI always find it fascinating how people look at the OGL. People fight vigorously to defend it, yet it's probably the source of some of the community's greatest gripes. Without it, it's unlikely DnD ever gets the dominance it has because of how easy, both from a development and legal standpoint, to take a proven product off the shelf and repackage it in other genres in ways that chokes out other games.\n\nThe things people gripe about regarding WotC are things you could be angry about with literally any decently sized company in modern America. Some seem to think taking them down will yield some devastating blow against late-stage capitalism, but I hate to break it to people but all that will do is probably kill the TTRPG market. As I noted above, there's no real money in TTRPGs at the moment, so nobody with the resources to reach as many people as WotC is likely to step into the void. That means fewer people in the hobby, and choking off the primary pipeline for new players in other TTRPGs.\n\nThe hobby is only as big as it is because of WotC and DnD. That's a hard fact, even if you don't like either. So even if how they act reminds you of our capitalist hellscape or you hate the new kids won't come off it easily, they're still providing a pool of recruits for your game we could really only dream of in the 90's. Play what you like. Promote what you love. But hating on DnD on forums is just therapy, but of a type that inherently sets DnD players on the outside when your goal should be bringing them into the fold.",
            "In my opinion 5e is a mediocre system with a terrible steward. Which results in a bad combo when there are good systems with fantastic stewards, great systems with great stewards etc.",
            "I'm pretty much in the opposite boat from yours. I'm not a huge fan of WotC or anything, but they aren't *spectacularly* worse than Catalyst or any other big company. They're a big company driven by profit that requires constant sales in order to justify staying in business. The ones making the important decisions are not invested in making the best game they can. That sort of thing.\n\nAll of my issues with 5E are in the rules: the way that resources recover at different rates for different classes, and the DM is forced to intervene and strong-arm the players to prevent them from merely *sleeping*; the complete inability to consistently describe what damage even is; the way that you need to cram *six entire combats* into *every single adventuring day* before the players even begin to make tough decisions; the way that air elementals, with their gaseous appendages, hit *harder* than water elementals that actually have mass (with fire elementals having the least destructive power of them all). That sort of thing. It's just not a very good game. It's not even in the top fifty percent of games. It's not even in the top two-thirds of D&D games. It's just bad.",
            "I hate WOTC, but my stigma with DnD is quite literally the mechanics and the type of player base it encourages.",
            "Gonna point out a few other biases that are still like left in your base observations.\n\n>They continued to print rail-roady adventures\n\nRail-roady or linear adventures aren't a bad thing and you'll find a lot of players and GMs actually prefer those over sandboxy or open-ended adventures, so I don't think this is really a fair critique.\n\n\n>failed to provide better tools for encounter design\n\nThey did actually make better tools for encounter design in Xanathar's Guide to Everything, easier to use and a bit more accurate. However I don't think there is a possible CR system for 5e (or really most DnD-like systems) that will actually be 100% accurate all the time. PF2e is close and that required a massive overhaul to the math of the game where you add your full level to virtually every roll, which is obviously not something WotC could implement without making a completely new edition (and also has its own downsides). \n\n\n>to make newer content more desirable than older content (e.g. power creep).\n\n\nPower creep is inevitable and unintentional in games like this, there is just less rigorous testing and less time spent designing content added later compared to when the Player's Handbook was being made. If Power Creep was intentional then every new subclass would be spectacular and every new spell a barn-burner, but that is not the case, plenty of new subclasses in 5e are horrible far worse than even the base PHB ones and plenty of spells in supplements go completely unused because they're not particularly good.",
            "Honestly I just think that the only reason to play 5e is because other people can't/wouldn't play anything else, otherwise there are multiple options that are both cheaper and better designed, especcially if you're a GM",
            "For me it\u2019s the monopoly. I don\u2019t have any issue with people playing the game per se (although WotC\u2019s practices haven\u2019t exactly been great imho and a consumer should also question whether they want to support such a business), but I think the degree to which it occupies the market is a shame. There\u2019s a lot of great games out there that people could have an amazing time with!\n\nAs an indie publisher I understand how it can massively squash any desire to keep on creating games or work for non-5E games. Not mention reducing the chances of making a living off RPGs outside the WotC sphere.",
            "I just don't like playing 5E very much. It's fine if other people do, but it feels like a big, ungainly mess to me, particularly as a GM.",
            "One thing to remember about companies is that the people involved change and the company with them.\n\nThis has been particularly true of the D&D portion of Wizards. It's generally been a place to build your resume until you either leave or get laid off.\n\nWith the introduction of 5e, I thought Wizards wasn't the worst steward we'd seen. When Wizards acquired D&D and created 3e\u2014as much as I might not like that edition myself\u2014they weren't being the worst stewards. TSR's entire history was slowly becoming a worse-and-worse steward of the game. Even in the AD&D era, a lot of decisions were more about politics than the game.\n\nAnd you can trace all those things to changes in the people.\n\nSo, yes, I'll agree that Wizards today isn't being a good steward of the game. And are thus doing a disservice to the hobby since the D&D brand continues to be the biggest name in the hobby. But don't paint with two broad a brush. It the current decision-makers and their bosses at Hasbro who are to blame.\n\nBut its a great hobby that doesn't need the industry. In some ways, I believe it would be better off without the industry. But there are great people on the industry-side that do occasionally get the chance to do great things when they're part of the right company at the right time.",
            "I'd agree that wotc has had some problems. Our table moved away from 5E after the open license leak. Even if they walked it back, the issue took away the DM's limited trust in the company. I've only been doing ttrpgs for a few years, but my biggest issue with 5E isn't specific to 5E; I feel that ubiquitous magic in role playing games is a pain to balance, use, and takes the fun out of the \"magic\" for me anyway. I think my biggest issue with 5E is how bloated the system feels; if I have a player that wants to use this one class that's only in some supporting book, one of us generally needs to buy the book for that one thing. I feel that there's stuff like this spread out all over in the 5E source books. In truth, I think this latter issue that I have is a natural end point for any popular ttrpg in the market unfortunately. \n\nI do think you are being harder on yourself than you need to be in saying that criticism of d&d (5E) is an assault on someone's ttrpg hobby. If it's being taken that way, you can maybe qualify the topic in your discussion: \"I love (tabletop) role playing games, but the 5E D&D system has some problems, such as...\"\n\nMaybe this isn't the same concept, but if someone consumes a lot of buttered green beans, telling them that I don't like buttered green beans very much generally, but I am a big fan a green bean casserole with cream of mushroom soup and crispy onions isn't overly critical. If I tell them that they're crazy/stupid/naive for eating them that way, then I think you can say I'm assaulting their preferences. (To be clear, there's nothing in this post that makes me think OP was this pointed.)",
            "I try not to recommend trying other games to 5e people cause I know that is an off-putting response to the problems people have but, so much of the time people are like I need help dealing with (long list of problems core to 5e) or I want to homebrew 5e to (thing some other game is fantastic at out of the box) and it's really hard not to tell them to just play something else.",
            "I think you hit a certain nail on the head. I love all the time I spent DMing 5e and introducing people to it, but when I look at the way I DM and all the advice I recieved and adventures I used, none of it actually came from WOTC. Matt Colville, The Alexandrian, Ben Milton, Burning Wheel, reading PBTA and powered by the apocalypse games... all of them made me an infinitely better DM than anything directly released by WotC",
            "I'm in the same boat as you. I started playing during the pandemic and jumped right in with 5e. I had a blast with it as I played a campaign with random people I ment online (whom I still play with to this day). \n\nThen the OGL debacle happened. \n\nMy online group discussed it a bit. At the end it simply came down to this: we like 5e but do we want to try something else? \n\nThe answer was yes. And Paizo did some great marketing by releasing a Humble Bundle that made jumping into Pathfinder 2e really easy. \n\nPaizo has so much good will in the TTRPG world because it's basically free and the adventure paths are diverse and high quality. This is SO different from what you see with  WOTC and 5e. Side note: 5e has some really fun adventures. \n\nSo, as you said, I don't hate 5e at all. I like it. But the OGL stuff basically gave my group a reason to try something else. \n\nI'm thankful at this point because I now realize that I enjoy trying other systems. We are currently playing Shadowdark and I'm really enjoying playing a system that embraces an old school mentality. It makes me want to try more OSR stuff and it has also made me more receptive to rules lite systems. In fact, I would say that I prefer them at this point. It seems that the communities involved in old school games and systems like Cairn, Knave, and the like are more friendly and they encourage novelty. \n\nOddly, I still say to my buddies \"What time are we playing DND next week?\" So some things never change.",
            "I think the main things that I would disagree with are how much wizards being \"bad\" should really matter. At the end of the day, if you already own the stuff, you don't need to give wizards money to play the game - so if you enjoy it, or you play with a group that's used to it and likes to homebrew it to their tastes, there really shouldn't be anything wrong with that. Enjoying something does not have to involve tacit condoning of the publisher's business practices. \n\nSimilarly, this idea that is kinda pervasive in this subreddit that you should play games 100% by the book and find entirely different systems if you want to change anything has always been weird to me. 5e isn't my favorite system of all time, but it is definitely pretty well fine, and it's very popular, so if the game you want to run or your table wants to play can be described as \"5e but a little different\" you really should not feel the need to go hunting for a game that fits that description. Also, while I agree the modules suck, honestly, I've never met a module I liked in any regard whatsoever for any game - I think the core concept is just too restrictive to be fun for what I like to do.\n\nI think a lot of it stems from people being upset at the industry. Small games get brushed away and aren't very successful, and it is easy to point to the dominant game and say, \"It's all your fault,\" but I think that technique isn't very useful. The blame game and public shaming of people who's only offense is liking a piece of media is not the way to change hearts or influence anyone. If you have a pet system by all means shout it from the rooftops. People might want to play if they have concrete reasons why it would be exciting, and \"not as shit as 5e\" is absolutely not a concrete reason.",
            "I think it's just badly designed. It puts too much onus on DMs. That might be fine if you're talking about paid DMs or pro Let's Plays or podcasts or whatever. For actually TTRPG play? Fuck that.",
            "What other systems would you recommend to someone that has only played/DMd dnd but its willing to try new stuff?",
            "My hot take: I'm fine with Hasbro doing garbage corporate stuff to d&d. All the good small publisher stuff grows in the shadows of the beast. I have fun with the cool things and only glance at the madness of Hasbro (and Disney, and Hollywood) just to be glad I'm free.",
            "I think almost everyone can agree that WOTC has been a bad steward for the game, but I for one am actually kind of excited to seem them destroy it. Right now it has a ridiculous market share, is not a very good system, and is hard to get anyone to play anyone else (partially because it's a such a bad system that everyone a) assumes other systems must be worst since it's so popular and b) have a huge sunk cost on trying anything else because they've already invested so much time and effort into making the game work that it's THEIR game. )\n\nWhile initially I was upset with scandal after scandal (OGL, Pinkertons, layoffs, more layoffs, AI, OGL again, AI again, and on and on) I've decided to be more positive and remind myself that every time WOTC shoves another foot in their own mouth more die hard D&D players will consider spending their money elsewhere on one of the many other games that deserve attention (even if mostly it's just PF, OSR or D&D clones ... baby steps).\n\nMaybe if WOTC fucks D&D up enough we can actually have an occasional SF game for a change.",

The 5e community is also pretty awesome: there's a ton of creative, top-notch third party content out there that's better than the actual game itself.\n\nBut in the end, it's a sloggy, unbalanced game with unplayable classes and unusable feats & spells, and nerfed modules and monsters. It's only usable after the GM applies a thick salve of home brew rule corrections to it.",

It's just a common compromise system for the table.\n\nHowever, two systems that have most definitely stolen a bigger piece of my heart would be Worlds Without Number and Shadows of the Weird Wizard (Shadows of the demon lord as well.) There's a lot to love in each of those games.\n\nI'm curious what you've found that works well for you?",
            "So my hot take is that most of this stuff can be reasonably ignored. The books I own will be mine forever and I don't need to care about DnD Beyond if I don't want to. WOTC are a mixed bag at best, but so is every company that size. The problem is capitalism, not that one for-profit company in particular is run by cackling villains.\n\nAs for the game itself, my /r/RPG unpopular opinion is that it's good actually. It's not perfect, it's really only suitable for one genre, and the rules encourage a certain level of slapstick and solving problems with violence, but I've played it for years and have had some great times with it. I think most of the problems come from people who don't like that style and/or try to crowbar it into being something it isn't.\n\nI also think a lot of the mathematical problems with it are overblown. Linear fighters and exponential wizards is a \"problem\" on paper, simulating perfect character builds in featureless white rooms, not something I've ever seen in actual play. In fact I'd go as far as to say that many things online D&D players are concerned about aren't really problems at the table. Being good at the game, understanding tactical combat, is always more important than how theoretically powerful your character build is.\n\nI've also never really had trouble playing other games. My experience is people will basically play whatever is going, as long as you step up to GM.",
            " > You shouldn't need to hate 5e to like other games.\n\nWithout any actual hate, I can explain as someone with almost 30years of play what's wrong and where are some roots of the \"hate\". For many of us, D&D feels like a wasted opportunity. It was supposed to be the ultimate system, at least for fantasy genre. You pick a scenario, apply D&D rules and play whatever you want. And for a while it worked somewhat well. With years, it became less and less viable. The rules are too specific, and for quite a complicated system, they somehow lack many core helpful details (example, there's no in-built visualization of wounds, something WFRPG did in early 80s). The game's lore started to transition into mechanics more and more. These days, I can't get random people to play D&D-based game, as they expect it to be about D&D lore. It's not a big deal for some people and a huge one for others. D&D (or the community made it this way) turned from a building tool into an actual building that must be deconstructed to fit non-related scenarios.  (as an example, every class is a caster now, I can't just run a medieval low magic scenario without putting a shitton of restrictions at the very beginning). \n\nSo there's a part that drags people back to D&D because you almost always start in this system. D&D carries sentimental value. When I transitioned from AD&D, i discovered how easy it can be to run a game in other systems. The same WFRPG 1st Edition did everything I ever need while fitting 100 page rulebook. But even though I always played with my friends back then who mostly preferred my style of GMing, I lost some players. But the system bounds me, and I can't offer the same experience within D&D boundaries. Well, not without some heavy homebrewing. (example, I can't set up a dirty gritty cloak and dagger scene in D&D). \n\nIt locks us in a very specific world and type of storytelling. And that's our flagship, our monopolist. You can ask paid GMs how hard it is to gather people for any other game compared to D&D. I wish more tuneable systems like GURPS, savage worlds (not exactly, just examples) would be the leaders in tabletop roleplaying",
            "I've got to disagree with WotC being a bad steward honestly, at least prior to 2023 and in the sense of growing the brand and keeping it healthy.\n\nThey bought the property from TSR and released 3rd edition which was the most popular the game had ever been and brought a ton of new life into it, they released the OGL which was massive for expanding not just D&D but the entire industry.\n\nThey released 4e, which people for the most part didn't like so very quickly they worked on a new edition which brought more people into the hobby than ever before. Sure a lot of that popularity was due to other things like Stranger Things and Critical role, but if WotC hadn't kept D&D from dying out in the late 90s we wouldn't have those references to begin with because the game would have been dead 20 years.\n\nWhat WotC tried to do with the OGL in 2023 was terrible, but people banded together and got them to back down and since then they have been pretty good to their word, there's been no repeat of the OGL debacle, we got SRD 5.1 in creative commons, and will be getting the same for 5.2 next year.\n\nWotC are FAR from perfect, all corporations are going to do skeezy corporate BS sometimes, but taking D&D from being a nearly dying brand best know for \"perverting\" the minds of the youth and causing the satanic panic and turning it into one of the most recognisable brands in the world with Hollywood movies, massive video games, and regular references in mainstream media is hardly being a bad steward.",
            "My issues with DnD in general is that within the community, the \"right\" way to play the game is never the same from player to player. GMs have house rules, fudge dice rolls and do all kinds of rules hacks to improve on the game. Players have disagreements with style of play with some players being denigrated for choosing to play suboptimal mechanical choices for RP purposes and other players denigrated for being munchkins or rules lawyers. This all stems from issues with the game itself. It can't seem to decide whether it's a game about telling stories or a game about tactical combat and collecting bonuses. I used to buy into that stuff like \"of course munchkins are bad\", until I realized a game like Blades in the dark can make a munchkin play just like an RPer because the rules specifically encourage both of them to strive for similar goals. They can keep the GM honest with dice while giving them tools to shape the story gracefully and within the rules as written. I'm fine with hacking systems to improve fit for a table or try new things, but with DnD the hacks are necessary workarounds to a fundamentally flawed system.",

            "As someone who started in 83.  It's the system!  I watched it change.  Back in high school I ran a second edition game with all new players, none had any experience.  We had to keep changing locations to find bigger tables.  It grew to 11 players, 12 if you count me. I am NOT advocating for a nostalgic return to older systems.  They have flaws too, but the direction WOTC took the game just isn't one a agree with.\n\nWotc was kinda stuck in a bad situation.  To keep the D&D name and not get laughed at, they had to keep certain core elements.  They also wanted to push rules consistency for convention play, add more tactics and more character options, etc.  They ended up trying to graft this stuff onto the old D&D core, and the Frankenstein monster they created is pretty scary.  The D&D name and brand identity is what sells it and they keep people invested by pretending this is a simple and easy system for beginners.  When people see how much there is to keep track of, the last thing they want to do is learn another RPG with different rules, especially if this is \"simple\".  It's not!  I want to swing my sword.  What the fuck is an action economy and why should my character care?  That is two totally different head spaces.  Its like roleplaying stops when you roll initiative and people seem to think this is acceptable and unavoidable because its all they've ever known.\n\nJust try and run a 5e combat session with 12 brand-new players (all at-risk kids like me, many were sober only because the GM said no drugs at the table) without half of them quitting because it will take an hour between turns!  Not to mention the huge barrier to entry of learning all these dissociative rules.\n\nWhile I never played 4e, I played every other edition all the way back to Holmes (read 0e, never played) plus dozens of other systems from Palladium, WhiteWolf, SJG, and more, and 5e is the most convoluted hack I have ever played!  It makes no sense and people spend a huge amount of time reading the book out loud on their turn, especially for spells.  When I saw that, my jaw dropped.  I don't even allow books on the tablen\n\nEven games with more complex rules at least had rules that made sense and respected player agency.  5e makes \"disarm\" optional and I think that says a lot.  In the older editions it was right in black and white that you had agency to do whatever you want.  If you want to kick a dragon in the nuts, the GM has to make a ruling on how to attempt that.  What the hell does optional mean?  Does the GM say \"sorry, we don't use that rule.\" ?  Does it mean nobody tested it so \"use at your own risk?\"  Its bullshit.\n\nPlayer agency has been downplayed in so many areas in the interest of simplicity that they made it a complex mess with a combat system that is neither realistic, challenging, nor fun.",

            "\"\u00a0**I believe that Wizards of the Coast has been a bad steward of D&D.**\"\n\n100% correct. I don't care about their shoddy business practices, but rather it bothers me that a beloved part of my life is being treated so poorly.",
            "I've moved away from DND over the past year, mostly because of **balancing issues** where player in my group progressively hone in on narrower and narrower builds and multiclasses because they're objectively the most powerful and playing entire classes like Monk and Ranger (other than Gloomstalker) can just become impossible because whatever you do you'll always have less health, abilities, and do less damage than anyone else in the party.\n\nLike the party composition in our current game is 5 full casters. One of them casts Conjure Animals at the highest level possible, one of them casts Animate Objects at the highest level possible, and another one of them casts Tiny Servants at the highest level possible. Another is a forge cleric/armorer artificer, and then there's me, who's playing an Order of Scribes wizard with the metamagic adept feat, which is normally a very powerful build and I'm somehow doing about half the damage of everyone else in the party.\n\nAnd **once you know how to break the game, it's knowledge you can't forget**, so it becomes increasingly difficult to choose options that you know are unoptimal because you know how to build the best character through mechanical abuse. **Made the game lose variety for me and very pay-to-win on an emotional level**.\n\nThen of course there's also all the drama that's been going on with WOTC over the past year or two. I haven't followed it too closely, but it definitely didn't raise my esteem for the company. More importantly, I think, DND 5e (2024)'s repeated unpopular attempts to rebalance the game to be easier to code into online programs that I rarely use like DNDBeyond just gave me the impression that **WOTC collectively decided that I and a large percentage of players simply weren't their target audience anymore**. Fair enough, then I guess DND isn't my target system anymore. \n\nBesides, **concentration of IP onto a single platform is a big red flag** for me. I know I'm about to commit the slippery slope fallacy here, but it's just such a classic corporate move at this point. Step 1: build online platform. Step 2: enable access to all past IP using that platform. Step 3: streamline future IP for implementation on the platform. Step 4: introduction of platform exclusives; support dimishes for off-platform use of IP. Step 5: continued use of the IP becomes only possible through use of the platform as off-platform resources are systematically disincentivized to the point of being impractical. I can't know that this is where WOTC is taking DND and DNDBeyond, but I have a strong suspicion that something of this nature is afoot, so I'm frankly happy to jump ship when I am so I don't have to deal with this shit anymore. **I just want to play my fun fantasy game and not have to constantly worry about the future of the IP or getting raided by Pinkertons.**",
            "I think for me the believe in the greatness of 5e began to crumble when I started taking interest in DnD 4e. Before I already was introduced to the scandal around ogl but honestly that just made me think, \"yeah that company is hella shit, huh?\" and not \"the game is shit\". I was honestly sad I started looking into alternative systems more to not having to support WotC.\n\nThen I got introduced to 4e through Matt Colville. That game made so many things better than 5e while not being much more complicated like Pathfinder. There isn't the huge discrepancy between the power level of classes that 5e has literally from the first level onwards. Every class gets cool powers, no class is \"boring to play\". Combat is long as well, DnD is about combat first after all, but it's tactical and not such a slog. Encounters are easier to prep for the GM. And I think there's much more even.\n\nThat made me understand that 5e really isn't the great system I thought it was. There are games that want to do the same but do it much better. And at least one of those games even comes from WotC themselves.",

I think it is WotC suffering from their success; as they learn they can get away with doing less and less, they cut costs, stop producing content, and rely on the market share to do the work for them. If they can make money from internal or external licensing (movie, bg3, mtg, but mostly just fan products and indie devs climbing on the bandwagon), then why bother maintaining a staff and creating real products? Why listen to customer feedback if people will keep spending money regardless?\n\nIf you want to talk about mechanics, well d20, limited build options, obtuse layouts, asymmetrical and inconsistent monster rules, gamification of mechanics and identical class abilities, and many other things all combine to make 5e (again, in my opinion) a very poor roleplaying game, which apes crunchier, better built systems but fails to deliver like they do, while simultaneously clutching on to the remnants of those systems which limit more rules-lite or free-form experiences. Those are problems which would exist regardless of who the owners were, unless they actually decided to change the system itself.",

I would argue that\u2019s not just good marketing.\n\nIt\u2019s a little crunchy but not too crunchy. It appeals to the weird in-between of Pathfinder to OSE which most modern D&D games take place. It works best at the levels most people tend to actually play at. There is always a better game system for a more more niche & targeted campaign but 5e has 0 interest in being niche. It wants the opposite. It\u2019s the MCU of game systems the McDonalds of table top. If you hate that, that\u2019s fair but it\u2019s good to a know THAT WAS THE GOAL. \n\nIt\u2019s like judging punk music because it lacks technicality.

Usually when talking about why this is a problem or why a village could \u2018beat\u2019 a Dragon it requires simulation in a white room that throws away all other gameplay factors and logical NPC reactions.

The closest they came was the period immediately after the WotC acquisition, where management who loved the game gave veteran designers a mandate to really make a good updated D&D, and then (it seems) largely stayed out of their way. We got 3.0 out of that, and while I will argue that 3.X remains the most robust rules foundation the game has ever had, it clearly wasn't finished. But all of the writers of it were off the team by the time the already-rushed 3.5E could have given them the chance to patch those flaws (echoing TSR's pattern of constantly bleeding talent rather than nurturing and retaining it), and Hasbro's influence and other managerial interference was also more apparent even by then (such as the dictate to shift the focus of the core rules into closer alignment with the minis wargame).

By which I mean \"back to requiring the 1ed books\".  Want to know what the actual freaking faith of the edeinos was?  Well, it's not in the 2ed LL book.  How did Malraux develop Cybertech so fast?  What's Aysle like?  I mean, there's also some genuinely cool stuff going on too (multiple \"subspecies\" of edeinos, three factions fighting to rule Tharkhold (including not-Putin), etc.), but even that I end up tweaking and retconning a bit of the stuff I thought was interesting (I -really- like Kanawa having a personal clone hive mind, but adding a woman and old man to the group seems like a good way to distract unknowing enemies).  And then you get to the dumb stuff, like the \"vampire\" pulp-villain, or the jiangshi (because PanPacifica needs its own zombie pre-apocalypse to be interesting, when it already could overlap with Orrorosh with no effort???), white witches in the Cyberpapcy take shock but don't accidentally summon demons (even though that's a major reason why Malraux broke the \"pagans\" working against him per the book). \n\nI said this was a rant...\n\nMechanics are both better and the final nail in the coffin.  See, the mechanics are generally superior to 1ed.  As a game it simply works better.  The Perks make character creation more structured (if not balanced), and reality storms are no longer an easy uber weapon for PCs, and exploding dice don't explode as much anymore.  The only thing I really dislike is having Gospog be potentially P-rated now, and the new Gospog don't conceptually grab me like the 1ed versions did.  Well that and one other teeny, tiny, itty, bitty thing.  See, 1ed made a point to introduce new \"side systems\" like a spell construction system in Aylse, a (for the time) unique take on miracles in the Faith/Focus system, a mini-game about corporate takeovers, a pulp science gizmo construction system, netrunning, and probably a few other bits and bobs besides.  And I can respect that gutting all of that made 2ed more streamlined and easier to run with, but it also gutted things to the point that I could just take the Savage Worlds game, and its Companion books, and have an even more robust and engaging system than 2ed offered.    \n  \nAnd so I was left choosing between supporting a game line where over half the books I wanted were already OOP for a system that honestly wasn't as robust as SWADE, or I could just take the handful of setting ideas I like, and port those back into 1ed.

WotC wanted to create one singular TTRPG system to avoid a plethora of competing products, with the idea that instead of creating a new game that would compete with D&D, the OGL would encourage third-party publishers to just create new D&D add-ons.

And my uninformed gut feeling is that the roleplaying industry would be a lot less free (as in freedom) for creators now had the OGL not been created when it was.\n\n\nAnd I think you're right, I should have clarified that WOTC is a bad steward now.\n\n\n>\u00a0Play what you like.

And thus 4e, and the attempt to close the market on the hobby to all of WotC/Hasbro's competitors, was born. The attempt to once again put the market back to it's isolated roots failed, gratefully, but that sting has never fully gone away, nor has the mission WotC was given - **make profit**.\n\nSo while it's absolutely earned by WotC for saving D&D *then*, it is also absolutely earned *now* by WotC/Hasbro for operating as poor stewards of D&D and the hobby abroad.",

It tries to pull D&D nostalgia without the substance (clunky rules about spell time, donning and doffing armor, the crazy visibility rules, but no dungeon procedures, weak as hell monks) while also trying to please the 3.5 crowd with it's character progression AND tosses some token narriatve elements in there from other games coming out around then. And then on top of that, it tries to pretend to be a toolkit game, which it isn't. \n\nIt simply isn't coherent.

I have other complaints, but I could probably deal with the rest if it weren't for the terrible, fundamental design decision that makes most of the combat encounters in the game boring and not at all impactful. I've mentioned this design element to my D&D group and have practically pleaded with them to not long rest after every single encounter, but I think that most D&D 5e players love how easily they can stomp enemies, and never seem to consider how boring and pointless that is. And my DM doesn't seem to care, so he doesn't do anything to prevent long resting (which, as you point out, is another silly element of the game: that the DM has to intervene to stop players from merely sleeping).",

There are a lot of players who\u2019ve only ever been on railroads and if you drop them in a true sandbox and the game rules aren\u2019t prompting or forcing story to happen they won\u2019t do anything with that freedom until the GM does story to them.\u00a0\n\nLike I said, I don\u2019t wanna run games that way\u2026 but it is in fact the default mode of trad RPG play and we should at least try to understand and respect why. **As a player they can be very very fun.** (Part of the issue is that D&D does not prompt emergent story from its rules and puts it all on the GM, so the railroad picks up the slack, but that\u2019s a bigger debate for another day.)",

A lot of these games are designed by people who think DnD is terrible and want to avoid its perceived pitfalls. But then are very surprised and upset that people who actually *like* DnD aren't interested in games that \"fix\" it.

I also think that some of those systems were really hard for me to grok at first, simply because they were different from what I was familiar with.\n\n\nI think Blades in the Dark & Starforged both taught me a lot about how the fiction can have a real presence in the game, and how a fictional consequence can have a real impact on difficulty without needing to involve any mechanical consequences. E.g. doesn't really matter what system, if a character is falling from a tower, that could then lead to mechanical consequences. Whereas if they are sitting comfy in a chair, not so much.\n\n\nWhereas I think running Dragonbane and OSE encouraged my players to be creative with what they do, rather than what was on their character sheet. I think those were more familiar to me coming from a little bit of 5e, and a lot of Pathfinder 2e. I found the Dragonbane rules more internally consistent of the two. If you are willing to go into it understanding it's a different vibe from 5e, I would probably recommend Dragonbane as the first system to try? I recently converted Willowby Hall to use Dragonbane, and my group had a blast.\n\n\nIf what you liked about 5e was the combat, doing math, and the general fantasy schtick, I think Pathfinder 2e does a good job of that. It's what I've run the most, and while it's not my favorite system, it is very good at what it does. Glass Cannon has their ongoing campaign 2 actual play on youtube that does a pretty good job showing how an experienced GM can run it IMO.",

Combine that with the fact that mechanically players are heavily discouraged from being creative (unless the DM does a lot of work for every encounter) and you have a system where being a martial, despite doing on average the same damage, feels really lame.\n\nCasters can solve so many problems outside of combat, and due to the way the system is designed, shine in combat also, both in crowd control and AoE damage because no one actually does the 6 encounters per long rest that the game assumes and thus casters get to go nova every encounter\n\nAnd this is not even talking about how at higher levels casters just get wayyyy more narrative agency compared to casters:\n\n>Party needs to talk with someone far away?

The industry as a whole was ill-prepared for the change.\n\nLike, TTRPGs would still exist, but they'd likely be an even smaller niche than they are now. Which means it would be harder to get groups together and play, no matter what game you run. People bitch about DnD's network effects, but the truth is other games get to ride it to a certain extent all the time since DnD already did the work of getting then on board with the concept of a TTRPG and in the door of the hobby at large.",

But you know that going in if you play it. 2e is a little more concrete, but it's still early days in the RPG industry. \n\n5e is just sloppy. It's poorly drafted.

I'm talking about basic shit that should be clear and anticipated, but evidently wasn't.\n\nOverall, I've found the quality of WOTC's books have also degraded with time, and most of their new books provide bullshit that isn't especially helpful. Like, the 5e sourcebooks are crap compared to 1e or 2e stuff. Compare, say, FR1 (Waterdeep and the North) to the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide. With FR1 you have stuff that, as a DM, you can instantly drop into your campaign. With SCAG, you're still making most stuff up.

            "D&D spent an entire decade as front page news. People were *very* aware of the brand.  I also think this is an American conceptualisation and we can use the rest of the world as an example. \n\nFor example, 2022 is the first time WotC published any TTRPG material in Japan. 2022! For 22 years there was no officially published D&D material in Japanese. Yes (as someone who lived there at the time) people played the English versions and just translated what was needed, but ultimately I would say it has been a relatively minor thing. Even D&D in Japan today is not that big, so RPGs are dead there? No. \n\nIn that time, RPG cafes and an entire RPG community flourished. Dozens of games got picked up and most importantly Call of Cthulhu became the biggest. This also is true all over the world. Dragonbane exists because Sweden never had a licensed D&D translation. Warhammer exists because GB struggled to get a license to print D&D stuff there and distribution was a mess. Dozens of other big names would have and did fill those shoes up to recently. In Finland, where I live now, an entire culture of RPGs grew around the city of Turku again in that same time totally absent of D&D and we have the biggest RPG convention in Europe, which is turning more to D&D... post release of 5e (or used to, haven't checked the stats the last few years). In fact the most popular Finnish language RPG is an OGL game using OGL materials, and before the (very recent) rise of that game Runequest was one of the biggest Finnish language RPGs. \n\n  \nAmericans would have been fine too. Even if no one had picked up D&D it'd be public domain and shit would be popping off right now.",

            "Ehh, you're right that you need *some* time pressure, but I think even without it being explicit, the party taking a month to clear a dungeon instead of three days is going to lead to them going 'I wonder what happened while we were gone', and I imagine they'd be reluctant to simply stay inside of the dungeon for weeks at a time.\n\nAn eight-hour rest is also something that seamlessly fits into the adventuring day. Are you traveling? A random encounter is basically pointless, because at the end of the night, the PCs will sleep, and get all their HP back, so it needs to be deadly or it's a waste of time. But if running into even somewhat challenging enemies means you have to wait an extra week if you want to be 'fresh' by the time you arrive at your destination, that's going to get the players to really think about whether or not they want to get into combat in the first place.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're working in eight hour increments, time pressures need to be *urgent*, which can be a problem if there are other things that the PCs might want to do in the meantime that *isn't* just waiting around until they're at full health.\n\nIf some spooky ritual is happening the next kingdom over, in a game where resting takes a long time, I might say that it's going to happen in three weeks, 'under the light of the next full moon'. Traveling, say, takes a week, so that's two weeks of slack to get there and resolve the problem. Two weeks might be enough to heal all the way up to full no matter how bad things get, so I have essentially two 'cycles' of adventuring time, but with lots of slack for non-adventuring activities.\n\nCompare to a rest being eight hours. The physical journey is still going to take a week, but if I want those two 'cycles', I can only really give the PCs two more days than the travel time, which means that if for some reason their travel is slowed, they're just screwed on that alone.",

            "I did read your comment and I felt you miss the force of my argument, so my post was mostly restating my argument with more clarity with the hopes you and any other reader wouldn't miss it. \n\nThat said, I still managed to respond two of the points you raised. I will go through them in order:\n\n1. You suggested that Chess is irrelevant because its a board game, not a ttrpg, and this discussion is about ttrpgs. I responded by arguing it IS relevent on the grounds that it is a turn-based, tactical, highly abstracted combat game, and ttrpgs like D&D include turn-based, tactical, highly abstracted combat games. So the comparison really is apples to apples. \n2. You said that D&D combat is childish because it is simplistic, non-rational/believable, and has no player death. I responded by primarily to the claim that is is non-rational/believable by pointing out that Chess is likewise non-rational/believable. This is because it is highly abstracted and gamified. I.e. is a great tactical game, but a poor simulation of combat. But enjoying great tactical games is not childish, because then Chess would be childish, and it obviously isn't. I though it was also implied that D&D is not simplistic compared to chess, since Chess is actually a very simple game. Simplicity of rules does not mean simplicity of tactics. Finally, I didn't think I needed to respond to the accusation that lack of player death is childish, because its absurd on its face. First, the amount that a player dies is not up to D&D, but to GMs, so you cannot blame D&D for lack of player death. Moreover, player deaths have become less common in D&D culture because of a shift of interest towards cooperative story telling from the more tactical/survival culture of the past. Obviously, I prefer the more tactical, combat-focused style where players are likely to die. That is what I am defending!\n\nYou raised a third point which I didn't respond to, namely, that you don't think combat is bad, only that there is more to ttrps than combat. I didn't respond to this because its irrelevant. Neither of us have said that there isn't more to ttrpgs than combat.",

            "Thanks for saying more eloquently what I wanted to say. People that believe WotC saved the tabletop RPG industry are flat-out ignoring the many spaces where tabletop gaming is very popular and DnD has zero presence. Japan, Sweden, Brazil, Germany are all great examples.\n\nAlso, in general I think it's fairly naive to think that the art of communal storytelling would have died with Dungeons and Dragons under any circumstances - in fact, I usually see the opinion that the lasting impact of DnD has smothered the hobby's natural growth, so it's kind of weird to see the opposite stated seriously here. There's perennial, timeless interest in narrative building with your friends. If somehow as a result of TSR's failing tabletop gaming didn't grow into that space, board gaming would have. Or video gaming. Or table talk games like Fiasco. (And to be clear I'm not saying that those things are a replacement for TTRPGs - I'm saying that because those things exist now, they would have led to the development of modern RPGs as they are because it's an obvious, winning application with the groundwork already laid in the '80s.) And now we've reached a point where it's silly to keep speculating, because the number and probability of the potential paths to modern RPGs is innumerable and shouldn't have been used as the basis of a defense to begin with. Logical fallacy sorta thing.",
            "Good points. To me, it was, as now, the flagship TTRPG of the industry. It losing its dominance was one thing, but for the actual *game* to fail was another- if the perception was \"all TTRPGs are DnD,\" then the game being defunct would mean the idea of \"TTRPGs were a fad\" hits the culture IMO and all that comes from that.\n\nThe *idea* of DnD would certainly live on in video games, which had already adopted many of its conventions and had several very successful games ran off the DnD engine.

Back then  execs believed game genres would blow up one year and vanish the next and were starting to pull support). \n\nWhite Wolf was picking up steam and had been around for a decade. A lot of TTRPG IPs were flipping hands really quickly and still getting published. Traveller was sold in 96, 98, and 02 and while it was messy it continued to be a TTRPG license not a comic book series. At the same time you say video games were taking over. The Forge was around at the time, and starting to spin up game ideas as well. \n\nThe point is, the narrative that we needed WotC to \"Save TTRPGs\" is not supported by evidence. TTRPGs would have been fine, and D&D probably would have survived in one form or another. Would 3rd edition have been the same? No way of knowing, probably not. Would there have been someone willing to print it? Almost certainly, but you are right there is a tiny outside chance someone decides it's not worth trying, and who cares, RPGs would flourish under a new flagship product just like they did everywhere else. \n\nWotC isn't even responsible for the biggest marketing they ever got (Critical Role) and the actual reason for the resurgence of RPGs has a lot more to do with the Geek Culture going pop in the 2010s than it does with anything else.",

The Forge wouldn't be around for a few years, and might not have even formed in the absence of WotC's consolidation of the hobby, as it was a direct reaction to that.
