            "Yes, it would bother me. Because there was no need for a comparison. He can compliment you and show appreciation for you without bringing anyone else into it. There was no need to bring his mother into the moment where you who had just endured days of agony and trauma to bring his child into the world. But I do think it\u2019s unlikely that he meant it to sound the way he did, so you\u2019re going to need to find a way to let it go. If it were me, I might just tell him that it bugged me and why and say that I know his intentions were positive but that in the future I would appreciate it if he didn\u2019t compare me to his mother or to anyone else, especially in my most vulnerable moments.",

It's not a minor thing, and it will e d Up destroying your marriage.",

Does it have a tangible effect, is it impacting my day to day life? E.g., if they\u2019re constantly not doing their share of the chores, etc\u2026\n3. Is it a repeated action?\n4. Is the little thing bothering me one of many little things that are bothering me?\n5. Is it just my ego thats bruised a little bit and I\u2019m getting defensive as a result?\n\nIf the answer to any of those questions is yes, then it\u2019s something i have to deal with; otherwise i just let it go. People make mistakes, mis-speak, etc\u2026 If there are 2 ways of interpreting something, id always try to use the \u2018good\u2019 interpretation.\n\nObviously, none of this is relevant for big things like cheating, abuse, etc..\n\nHope this helps.",

She is resilient and strong in his eyes. To use his mother as an example, he's trying to make a connection/bond between the two experiences he's probably ever known in his life. He sees you both as strong but in your own separate way.\n\nI would simply sit down with him and have a little chatty chat.

We have to understand this comes from 15+ years of your mom by your side (for most people, not me haha). I don\u2019t think of it as making it about her. I think that now that you are right up there next to her in his head among the strongest, bravest, and most important people on the planet, if not the most important. I would honestly be very touched to be compared to a mom if she wasn\u2019t obviously a loser. Pushing out a baby puts you among the strongest people ever in MY head.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Now, it is definitely concerning if you often feel second place, and THAT is worth having a conversation about together.

It's just that he's known her to be strong his entire life. You're just as strong. But simply through the nature of time, thats his point of reference. For a bad analogy, think of two weightlifters. Both lift the same amount of weight. One holds it up for 30 minutes. One holds it up for an hour. She's the hour because she had a head start, AKA his entire life. That's not him saying you're less strong than her. That's just him saying you can keep this up and I believe in you. I would not take this negatively. Poor word choice, yes.

If you or her start ever not to get along it's going to cause a internal struggle trying to make both of you happy.  That may breed resentment over the long haul.

I'd start with never having another child with him.

Your daughter is the one who's in the middle of a sane human (you) and a barrage of sexism.\n\n\nIf you haven't, start *now* talking to her about gender and gender expectations (and how they're fucking stupid).

After a while, my husband asked if we could try for another child, it doesn't matter if girl or boy. I told him I'd only agree if he could prove that he can care for the current child all on his own and can also cook and clean and do household stuff. I wanna see if he could care for the kids on his own if something ever happens to me. Sure enough, he did. For a whole year, he took care of all cooking, did most of the cleaning, and took care of our little girl. Then, when the new baby was born, he also did most of the diaper changes and woke up at night to care for her. He became a stay at home dad while I worked and went to school full time. Our second child was a clingy baby and would wake up at night looking for us and did that every night until she was 4 years old. Yet, he still got up to check on her every time during all those four years. Of course, after I was done with school, he went back to work and we both did an equal amount of chores and caring for the kids. \n\nAs for the in-laws, any time they told us to try for sons, we told them that we're done having kids. When they told us, right in front of our girls, that we need to have sons, for \"only sons are important,\" we stopped showing up to their family events.

After the first three children were all boys, she decided she would try up to six times for a girl.  The fourth child was still a boy, and also born with significant birth defects.  Her sixth child was (finally) a girl.  They were a good family and as happy as most families are.  But still -- it took six tries to have a particular sex of baby, and there were no guarantees on that sixth pregnancy either.  \n\nMy first husband was one of four boys. \n\nIf the goal is to have a particular sex, whether boy or girl, you could end up having a lot of babies to reach that goal.  \n\nI think marriage counseling is a good idea.  He needs to be able to decide for himself and not be overly influenced by family members who are not taking on the responsibility of pregnancy and child raising and therefore really have no say in how many children you have.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dl3enn/i_38m_accidentally_ended_up_tracking_my_wifes38f/",
        "content": "My wife and I (both 38) have been married for about 12 years and have 2 kids in elementary school. She's the love of my life, and everything you read below should be rooted in the fact that I love her and I'm trying to be a good husband to her.\n\nSo basically I pulled an Abed from Community...I started becoming concerned that my wife was bipolar because she would sometimes be extremely energetic and fun and sexual and just kind was this force to be reckoned with. Other times, she would become so argumentative and standoffish and unstable but also withdrawn and depressed that I worried she might do something to hurt herself. She always chalked it up as depression symptoms.\n\nI love her so much, and it was obviously not fun for me to become her figurative punching bag, but I always had hope because of the other person she could be. So in a moment of frustration after being told that what I was describing in a fight about her behavior wasn't even happening, I decided I was going to track some of her behaviors for a year to see if I could learn anything that might help and to make sure I wasn't making this up. I didn't want a \"gotcha\", I just wanted to see if I really was remembering things inaccurately because I felt like I knew what was going on but the gaslighting about my own memory was effective.  As I've alluded to, I basically ended up tracking her cycle. From the time her period ends until maybe 10 days after, our average sex frequency is daily and hot. She gets a lot accomplished, and if anything she's too ambitious about the number of projects she takes on.  House projects, volunteering stuff, visiting a friend who's lonely, organizing family outings or extended family events...it's like she has more energy than time to accomplish everything she wants to do. She's a wonderful wife and mother, showing lots of love and affection.  I'd marry that woman twice. For the other 20 days a month, we have a sexless marriage. She's kind of just getting by emotionally, at best. She works out less and she is moodier. In the week leading up to her period, she's borderline abusive. I try to get the kids out of the house as much as possible so they have fewer hours with her and generally just stay away from her. If she was always that person, I'd divorce her, but I know that it's just cyclical now. Knowing about how she changes through a 30 day cycle has made me a better husband and better at anticipating her needs, although like Abed, I think it would be creepy to explain how I got so much more thoughtful.\n\nSo I'm not the first guy to notice that his girlfriend or wife is harder to be around at certain times of the month, and I'm trying not to be a neanderthal here.  I've got some life experience, I've been in other serious relationships, and I'm a caring and loving husband: this isn't normal. Her swings through the month are a much, much wider variance than most people experience. Your average person seems to maintain who they are from week to week with just a little change up or down, but she's like 2 or 3 different human beings over the course of a cycle.\n\nShould I be worried about her health? If I should, is there a way to make these worries known without sounding like a psycho who tracked his wife's cycle? I do think this has gotten worse as we aged and after she had our 2 kids. I wonder if becoming a mother led to some PPD and some knock-on effects, but I've never heard of \"period onset biopolar disorder\" which is what I feel like I'm experiencing.\n\nHow can I take this random information I know and be the most helpful / least off-putting about what i know?\n\n\n-----\n\nTL;DR: My wife is a good person overall who demonstrates wild mood swings.  I started tracking things to see if I was crazy...fights, times she initiated sex, times she snapped at the kids, times she did random acts of kindness, etc. and realized I was tracking her cycle and her actions line up perfectly.  What do I do with this information to be the best husband?",

            "Look up Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) and see if any of it resonates with you. I have it and during the luteal phase ( the period after ovulation up until the start of menstruation)  I am a completely different person. I however have a tendency to self isolate during this time because my mood is so bad I know I will be horrible to people I care about. I get wildly depressed, anxious, irritated, don\u2019t want to be touched, can\u2019t sleep, and sometimes straight up suicidal. \n\nI\u2019m fine now after getting my hormones regulated. You wife might not have PMDD at all but it definitely is tied to the hormone fluctuations people have during their period. She needs to see someone. It\u2019s really\nCommon for people with PMDD to attempt suicide, and it often isn\u2019t picked up/diagnosed until this happens.\n\nIt\u2019s also not fair on you or your kids.",
            "I will agree that it sounds like PMDD. I will also warn you that it is difficult for doctors to recognize and therefore difficult to get treatment for. It took me doing the research myself and then going to the psychiatrist, primary care doctor, and gynecologist before I got any help. So don't be surprised if you go to your wife and she says that the doctor didn't see anything wrong. She might need your tracking before they take her seriously.",
            "I have PMDD. Exact same situation. Psychiatrist had my mom track my moods to see if I was bipolar. Mapped exactly to my period.",
            "PMDD is real and it can get worse during perimenopause, as your hormone levels drop (ask me how I know!) I can now tell when I'm two days out from my period starting because I get spikes of white-hot rage, severe enough that I actually worry that I'm going to go HAM on someone and lose my job, it's so strong and barely within my control. Then the day after my period starts it's gone like nothing happened.",
            "My husband noticed the same thing about me. he asked me to mention it to my OBGYN. Really pissed me off, but I did. My doctor ordered all kinds of blood tests. Turns out, I have high prolactin levels, which need to be monitored by MRIs and a neurologist to routinely rule out pituitary cancer. \n\nI'm on meds to lower it, and my moods have stabilized. \n\nIf you see something, say something.",
            "I can also add that at her age, perimenopause is a real struggle, she can have her hormone levels checked and at least have awareness of where she is at. Some women start perimenopause around 40! I understand you are struggling, but she is probably also struggling with the intense hormonal changes that happen to women at this stage in their life. Good news is that these things level out after menopause I\u2019ve heard",
            "The one thing I'll say here is - I (f) have always been exceptionally stable across all cycle phases. My mood or outward expression never changed. UNTIL one month I had some sort of hormonal imbalance and OH MY GOD did I have a tough time. I thought women were exaggerating, but I get it now - I cried multiple times per day over really stupid shit (like my dog won't come when I tell him to come), when normally I cry once every couple of years. \n\nI can't even imagine how frustrating it would be to live with such mood swings every month, and I think she should look into it so it can get better, both for her and your sake.",
            "Hi! I have PMDD. My doctor prescribes a low dose SSRI for me to take for 14-ish days and it helps a lot with the mood swings. I take it from ovulation until the start of my period. It\u2019s been super helpful at keeping me level-headed and it feels low committal cause I don\u2019t have to be on it 24/7 and I can skip a month if I want to be able to drink or whatever for an event or vacation.\n\nI worry therapy won\u2019t be helpful because it literally feels like you\u2019re going insane. Also, you can\u2019t really tell it\u2019s happening until your period starts and you\u2019re like OH that\u2019s what that was. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s noticing the swings as well. \n\nCome at her with kindness and understanding because that\u2019s what she needs. Give her a lot of reassurance. Men don\u2019t usually experience having 4 different moods per month so be mindful if you try to compare yourself to her. Women\u2019s bodies are complex. Ask her what she thinks could help and share other options that she might not know about.",
            "You share this information with her in a productive and supportive manner. You offer to support her in determining if these variances are beyond the range of being healthy and if she needs support. \n\nThere may be small changes that can help. Issues with diet, sleep, etc. \n\nAlso, be aware that women\u2019s health care is a sad, depressing and neglected corner of medicine. It\u2019s full of ignorant, gaslighting jerks who delight in throwing up their hands and declaring the women seeking help as hysterical, imagining things, exaggerating, etc. It\u2019s pretty daunting. \n\nShe lives in her body. She likely knows that her cycle makes her life challenging. It does for many women. This is what it\u2019s like living in a world that prioritizes men\u2019s healthcare and uses it as the \u201cnorm\u201d/baseline.",
            "Sounds like PMDD to me. Have you guys discussed her fluctuating behavior in the past? Honestly I would just tell her you notice that it comes and goes monthly, more or less, and maybe it\u2019s worth talking to her doctor about. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t tell her you tracked it specifically. Maybe suggest she track her mood? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy a husband would notice cyclical behaviors. \n\nYou also have every right to stand up for yourself and your kids, regardless of cause it is not okay to be mean or cruel to the family. It\u2019s okay for you to tell her it\u2019s time for her to look for some answers here.",
            "I agree the PMDD is a good place to start. A friend of mine has it bad bad. Not only the hormones making her crazy, but the period and body  pain is through the roof. Not all women are comfortable with showing their pain to people, even their partners. \n\nAlso the other mental health issues like ADHD, autism, depression, etc can be exasperated by hormonal fluctuations. If she has a mom or a sister she\u2019s reasonably close to maybe ask them about family history?",
            "You sound exactly like my partner a year ago. Your wife's symptoms sound exactly like mine. I got diagnosed with PMDD. I'd break up with the poor man every month right before my period because he wouldn't let me isolate. I was already on SSRIs for MDD, so my gyno put me on a low dose birth control. She said the other option is an IUD. I've had an IUD before and bled for 9m straight, so I chose to try the bc first. I'm only on week 2, so idk if it's going to help or not. Only time will tell.",
            "hey! have suffer from PMDD and am prescribed a super low dose of ani-depressants i take only the week before my period and it helps sooooo much. i also track my period with an app called flo and it's extremely accurate, where you log your feelings /symptoms for the day and it notices and tells you patterns such as \"today you may feel confused/irritable/have mood swings\" or \"today you may feel calm/energetic\" depending on where i am in my cycle. check it every day and when im starting to feel angry or depressed for no discernible reason, instead of thinking everything around me sucks and questioning life i now am able to say to myself, \"no, it is my hormones, and i am being unreasonable\" if i get snappy or think my bf is being an asshole when he truly is not. really really helps me and my relationship.\n\nEDIT: i highly recommend against hormonal birth control as it made my PMDD and depression in general way way worse, even though it lightened my actual period (blood, cramps)",
            "likely PMDD. I function best on Yaz, which is a specific birth control formulated to help treat it. I tried out an SSRI but I didn\u2019t experience any benefits from it and I noticed significant worsening in symptoms after I took a break from Yaz. I also take NAC as a supplement and I do believe it has a positive impact on my mental health. the symptoms are still there but I\u2019m not wanting to unalive/destroy all my relationships/upend my life every month anymore",
            "I like data. Like I count everything. \nIt's my career and my passion so yeah. \n\n\n\nI also accidentally started counting my wife's periods.

If not, try couples counseling as to why she won't address this situation that's obviously a problem. \n\nYou also have the leverage of the kids, ie she's lashed out at them, and you have a reason, beyond yourself, as to why she should seek help. Sometimes people need to really see the whole picture in terms of breadth of the consequences of their actions before they want to change.",

Was living with my parents at the time and after a particularly shitty outburst my mom actually threw my car keys on the table between us and told me to get out of the house if I couldn\u2019t act right. That was a wake up call and I went to the doctor. If she won\u2019t get on medication (the only thing that helped me), then she\u2019s sacrificing her family\u2019s wellbeing by being stubborn.",
            "I feel like this is a conversation that you could just have outright, considering how long you've been together + the fact that you've presumably navigated some medical stuff around having kids? She might already know about the pattern, but not feel comfortable bringing it up to you, or doesn't realize that it's that noticeable.",
            "My stepmum had this and until she went though menopause it was awful. My dad ignored it. She is one of the loveliest women I know but she was a demon during her cycle. \nApproach her about it when she\u2019s in a good space because there is help available and it can\u2019t be nice for her either.\n\nMy one personal experience of something like this was the one time I took the morning after pill. I have never acted like that or FELT like that ever again.

That\u2019s then used to fuel the purest form of rage and overwhelm you\u2019ve ever felt in your life. Except it happens every month. It\u2019s unreal. Genuinely insane.

But I think the way in here, if you really want to help her, is to point to how this is objectively affecting not just you, but your kids, and absolutely insist she get treatment.  A year ango I insisted my spouse get treated for anxiety and depression and am so glad I did.  He was becoming abusive and that\u2019s not something I want to tolerate, I certainly don\u2019t want my kid exposed to it (though most of the abusive behavior was focused on me, I didn\u2019t know how that might change over time), and I also didn\u2019t want my kid to see him treating me that way and me just taking it.

Yes, yes I did. \n\nOnce, I explained why and told her about what I found and how I felt she was actually happy. Some of it was things she knew. Some wasn't. She agreed my reasons seemed justifiable.

She has no control over how her body\u2019s hormones change, so I think the best course of action is to be extra sweet and anticipate her needs in that week where she is on edge. Let her sleep late. Make dinner. Randomly surprise her with her favorite candy. Offer her a back rub (actual massage only).\nIm not sure about your comment saying she has wider mood swings than other women. Your frame of reference may be from women who are medicated - with hormonal birth control or antidepressants, which would mask the true changes due to natural hormonal fluctuations, or other women may be masking more while your wife doesn\u2019t (because you are her husband).\nI agree with PMDD. It seems to be closely tied to ADHD as well.",

            "There are four phases of the menstrual cycle: mensuration, follicular, ovulation, and the luteal phase. The 10 days after her period you describe are the ovulation phase - it's when women tend to have the most energy, highest sex-drive, and generally feel the best. The time before her period is her luteal phase - it's essentially the opposite, when women tend to be at their lowest. For most women, the difference is fairly minor. For some, however, it is significant. \n\nPersonally, I just thought that I randomly got depressed. That was until I started tracking my cycle for entirely unrelated reasons. After a few months I noticed that those 'random' days when I woke up wanting to die were always exactly 10 days out from my period. Like many other people here, it's likely that I have PMDD (though I have not been properly diagnosed). \n\nI tried hormonal therapy (i.e. birth control) to help, but the side effects were too much for me. At the end of the day, just \\*knowing\\* that the reason I feel the way I do is because of my hormones is incredibly helpful. It's much easier to look at a calendar and say, \"I've felt like dying for the past week, but I know I'll feel better in exactly three days - I can make it until then,\" than it is to just feel like the world is falling down around me for no apparent reason. I also try to plan activities around my phases. I'm more likely to go for a hike when I'm ovulating, and I'll probably opt for a movie night if I know I'm going to feel awful because I'm in my luteal phase. \n\nIf I were you, I'd wait until the beginning of her ovulation phase to bring it up. Like others said, share it in a productive manner and let her know that you noticed she feels awful in the days leading up to her period and that she may want to talk to her doctor about PMDD.",
            "I think it's nice for a partner to be aware of the others partner's menstrual cycle. I do not find it creepy. We are driven by chemistry in our bodies and hormonal fluctuations are just one part of it. A partner that is aware of the cycle is a partner that can be compassionate and supportive. Talk to your wife, be gentle and find the time when she is able to receive this information well. You want to support her and I think she'll understand that.",
            "As many others have commented, it sounds like PMDD. Traditional PMDD treatments (like meds and birth control) don\u2019t work for me, unfortunately, so I just try to increase awareness of my moods during this time of the month and isolate and do self-care when possible. I have found that a really clean diet (no added sugar, no alcohol or caffeine - basically remove anything very inflammatory) helps a lot. As does heavy cardio, though my body often doesn\u2019t want to cooperate. Also, avoid stress - our tolerance is awful during this time. I hope she finds what works best for her!",
            "I have PMDD. The supplement brand FLO changed my cycle after I started taken them. I feel so much more in control of my PMDD symptoms since going off birth control. I would look into it as an alternative \"treatment\".\nYou should also listen to the book \"Your Brain on Birth Control\" by Sarah Hill. It will provide so much information and context about women's hormones and brain functions that I think you would find interesting and useful.",
            "Echoing a lot of commenters to say that it sounds like PMDD, which I\u2019ve been diagnosed with myself. In my experience, hormonal birth control doesn\u2019t make a significant enough improvement in my emotional stability on its own, but I also haven\u2019t had good experiences with the side effects of SSRIs. (And tbh if you value your sex life, SSRIs are a big risk. Not only can they tank your wife\u2019s sex drive and ability to orgasm, but some people continue to have those problems even after stopping the medication.) However, I\u2019ve had enormous relief from Wellbutrin. It\u2019s a different kind of antidepressant (an NDRI vs SSRI) that\u2019s much less likely to cause weight gain and sexual dysfunction.",

I\u2019m in therapy for other things and I also have endometriosis, which is all tied to the PMDD. Idk how I would bring it up to her, but I would definitely bring it up to her because you love her and it\u2019s not only hurting you and your family and needs to be addressed, but I can guarantee that her quality of life would sky rocket as well if she got some help if it was in fact PMDD",
            "I have PMDD. It is hell. \n\nIn middle and high school, I just had very severe cramps, but nothing like the stereotypical PMS symptoms. I started taking BC for the cramping and it helped.\n\nI started college, and something changed. Now a week before my period I was so, so deeply depressed. I have depression and anxiety, so it didn't seem much like a red flag to me. I just knew I was having weird highs and lows.\n\nThen the anger started. I am not an angry person. I grew up in a household that screamed and yelled, and I hated it. It takes a lot to make me genuinely angry. \n\nBut all of a sudden I was always *enraged*. I would lose a shirt or something, and the process of looking for it would have me so disturbingly angry I would scream at the top of my lungs and throw things and just have the strongest impulse to break or hit something. \n\nOf course, feeling that kind of anger scared the shit out of me and was always followed by sobbing because I was *scared* of myself and didn't want to hurt someone or myself. \n\nI read about PMDD and the effects of anxiety/depression on women's hormones. I found accounts of women who had claimed they stopped having periods altogether via birth control, and that it changed their lives. No more anger, no more depression (related to menstruation/pmdd, not regular depression disorders). \n\nI did the research and found that while there was not *extensive* research on the topic, there is no current studies that show women experience any negative health effects if they skip their periods. \n\nI have not had a period since I would say 2019. I just skip the week of sugar pills that come with birth control and continue taking active pills. It has genuinely had a major improvement on my life. Obviously, not having a period is nice in general, but I never have dealt with any of the mood swings or extreme emotions I was struggling with.\n\nSeeing a doctor is, of course, always recommended. However, if she's open to it, she can try managing it with birth control and go from there. To my knowledge, there's not many other solutions to PMDD. \n\nI know you care about your wife and just want her to feel better, but also advocate for yourself. It is very unfair for you and your kids to have to deal with her instability, especially if she tries to dodge any treatment or even a diagnosis. \n\nShe *could* be a threat to herself or others. I know how strong those feelings are. It is so hard to control. If she doesn't want to do it for herself, make sure she knows she has to do it for you.",

For example, the more energy you describe, to plan social outings in those weeks, or certain weeks creativity is higher, so to start projects in those weeks. It also Goes into Some (non-pharmaceutical) strategies to manage symptoms. Like resting more in the later weeks or eating different foods. \n\nI read your mention of her hesitations around SSRIs and hormonal BC, there are more \u201cnatural\u201d ways to try to regulate her cycle (as in hormone fluctuations) more.

All issues can be worked out in a marriage as long as both of you can work together to resolve them. If she has no insight, then she\u2019s going to gaslight you and that\u2019s a problem. The other issue is tolerating someone\u2019s bad behavior because they have a condition. This is called codependency. Your children will be watching their mother and you.  You are the role models. They learn how to regulate their moods from both of you, they learn what to tolerate in relationships. They will marry someone like you or your wife. If she is borderline abusive to you, they may marry a person that is borderline abusive to them. People create patterns in their life from their upbringing. I would try to work it out with her as soon as possible to decrease any collateral damage to the children. They have medical treatments for her condition, if she is diagnosed with PMDD, but she must be a willing participant in her treatment.",

            "My periods absolutely affected my mood and other things. I have horrible endometriosis and a 21-25 day cycle. I never liked any of the birth control options I tried in the past, even though it was only 2 options, so I decided to just deal with my symptoms until Covid switched on an autoimmune disease. This autoimmune disease has destroyed every joint in my body. I\u2019m in severe pain daily and disabled. For 2 years of my condition I wasn\u2019t on BC and omg. It was bad. The hormonal fluctuations my body was going through every 3-3.5 weeks were sending me into full blown flair ups. For several days before my period would start I would be so depressed that I was suicidal basically. Life had no meaning, I would break down in tears constantly and cry over seemingly nothing. I was so irritable that I couldn\u2019t be around anyone. I finally spoke in detail about this to my doctor. We checked my hormones to find I was devastatingly low in progesterone and high in estrogen which is bad for an autoimmune disease. I went on the Depo shot which is progestin based and my god\u2026. I wish I had done this sooner. It doesn\u2019t fully stop the period but the \u201cspotting\u201d is so much easier to deal with that the full week+ long periods I was having. My severe pain is almost nonexistent now, and I don\u2019t have the wild mood swings and autoimmune flare ups that would make me bed ridden for up to two full weeks. \n\nThe best thing you can do is to sit her down when she\u2019s in her loving phase and tell her what you\u2019ve done. Tell her how concerned for her you are and that there are options. There are different kinds of BC that she can try and I recommend the progestin based ones cus they are not as harsh on your body as estrogen based ones. If my loved one sat me down with a serious concern I would listen to them.",

If she is, we sometimes have to change them. Especially after having kids which do impact our hormones permanently at times. \n\nFurthermore,  maybe a lifestyle and diet nutritionist and functional doctor can help her get to a root cause with a gyn as well.  She may not need new medication but a complete change.  \n\nAnd always word it from her angle: her health, her welllbeing, etc. and how it impacts people around her and her interaction.\n\nI get extremely existential during pms.

If she's going to explode or become resentful... then honestly there's probably not much to be done. If my husband told me that our marriage was suffering because of x y and z specific behaviors that make him and our kids feel degraded and hurt, and that he noticed there is an obvious pattern to why it might be happening and laid out a path to try and fix it... it would hurt to hear, but I would be really grateful that he wanted to work together to make our marriage and family better.

A friend of mine with PMDD is about to undergo a full hysterectomy, with removal of the ovaries, to stop PMDD. It will throw her into early menopause. She will need to go on HRT (hormone replacement therapy) for the estrogen she needs to feel good. But she will have a steady mood again. She can live her life again. No more periods. No more major depressive episodes. \n\nYou're coming from a place of caring. You aren't attacking her. You want her to be happier all the time.

I mean, sure, it sounds like PMDD, but I had a lot of issues with my period and they were all due to _PAIN_, which definitely impacted my mood at different times over my cycle. \n\nAnd not just the pain, but the gastrointestinal problems, which, also, caused pain, and the full body cramps, and I bled a *lot* and I had anemia every month, which, oddly enough, wasn\u2019t diagnosed until I stopped having my period, but has it\u2019s own roster of symptoms, which include seriously extreme exhaustion. \n\nAlso, if she gets a Mirena, she should and can be knocked out for that to be installed. It\u2019s one of the most painful experiences I\u2019ve ever had and I nearly kicked my gyno in the head, the first time she tried in the office, as an automatic response. She was the one who suggested having it installed at the outpatient surgery center, so that I could be knocked out. It\u2019s not anesthesia, it\u2019s like what they do for colonoscopies\u2014pain medicine and medicine that makes one totally out of it. \n\nDoctors tell women that IUD installation *doesn\u2019t* hurt, but _every single woman_ that I\u2019ve talked to has told me that it really, really hurt.

She might take it wrong, I could see why if mentioning health. But it\u2019s not really just health shes not ok 20 of the 30/31 days and that I\u2019m pretty sure ain\u2019t normal.

            "I see others have mentioned PMDD. I have it, but didn't know it until I got a blood clot, because I was told I had to stop taking birth control then. Up until that point, I had been on birth control pretty much nonstop (outside of pregnancy) since I was 16, to help regulate PCOS (another hormonal illness but not related to PMDD as far as I know.) Being on birth control kept my PMDD in check,  and when I had to go off the BC, it it became apparent that something was very wrong. I would become suicidally depressed to the point that I was not safe to be by myself for about 10 days during each month. All I could do during that time was cry, sleep, and accuse everyone else of causing my problems.\n\nMy OBGYN found a birth control that was safe for me to use even after blood clots, the Depo-Provera shot. It has changed my quality of life dramatically. I no longer have those non-functional 10 days each month. I did gain some weight when I started the shot and that sucked, but it was worth it to me. With your wife, there are probably way better options for hormonal treatments that don't have bad side effects, since she doesn't have to consider the blood clot issue. \n\nSince you said she is a bit touchy about mental health, I would suggest that she go to her OBGYN for this. Mine was the one who treated me successfully, even though I have a psychiatrist. I realize that this might not be easy to broach with her, but if you can get her to talk about it during the time that she is more functional, perhaps you can get her to agree to let you come along even to the appointment. \n\nBest of luck, I know this is really hard but there is absolutely hope.",

HRT is better than birth control for managing this.

Doctors didn\u2019t ever really acknowledge my condition or offer any viable treatments. \n\nDuring a particularly bad spring allergy season, I noticed my PMDD symptoms disappeared. So I did some googling, found tentative research suggesting PMDD is tied to histamine response, and that antihistamines may help with symptoms. I was taking Claritin or Zyrtec daily for hay fever, and ended up getting rid of my PMDD symptoms on accident as a result. \n\nNow, I switch between Claritin or Zyrtec during my luteal phase, and it pretty much completely cures my PMDD symptoms.

It\u2019s hell. \n\nI have also struggled to mentally be okay with taking any medications for my mental health. \n\nI would recommend sitting down and writing out a plan to talk through this with your wife. \n\nYou want to start with the right time: you know when she\u2019s \u201cup\u201d so maybe think about planning a mini vacation for the two of you in a neutral, peaceful place. Something free of distractions where you\u2019re going to be able to consistently reaffirm your love and care for her. If a mini vacation is out of the picture, send the kids to some overnight stays or get a sitter for the day/night. \n\nNext, you want to plan your talking points. Write them down so you can easily reference them. \n\nAnother approach might be to write her a letter or show her this post. I don\u2019t know how easy it is for you to verbalize difficult things, but you can communicate in writing, so that might be an option. \n\nNext, you need to mentally put yourself in the right place to have this discussion. You\u2019re not a teenager. Periods are not embarrassing or shameful. So, act like it. Be a bit matter of fact in your statements, don\u2019t stumble or hesitate on using words like period, PMDD, cycle, etc. Make sure you can intelligently refer to the phases of her cycle. Be able to describe the symptoms of PMDD. Being a bit matter of fact or scientific helps take the emotional sting out. Think about how a kind, straightforward doctor would talk to her. \n\nMake sure she knows this isn\u2019t a \u201cher\u201d problem. She is going to have to be the one to fix it, but you\u2019re not going to leave her alone to figure it all out. This is an \u201cus\u201d thing and we\u2019re going to fix it. \u201cI see how low, sad, angry, and tired you start to get x days before your period. I feel absolutely helpless during those times because all I want to do is fix what is hurting you. You are the love of my life and I will walk through fire for you. I can\u2019t fight this alone though. I need to do this with you.\u201d\n\nLast, have an action plan. Get a list of 3-5 doctors who specialize in PMDD and who are accepting new patients. Call her OB for referrals. Let her know you want to go with her to the appointments to support her and help advocate for her. Let her know you don\u2019t think she\u2019s broken but you do know something is wrong and know that together you can find a way to make life better for her. \n\nOrganize a list of treatment approaches from the PMDD sub and this thread. You could organize it by medication, lifestyle change, therapy, and surgical options in a pro/con chart. Let her know that you are not suggesting one particular treatment\u2014you wanted to do the mental and emotional labor of giving her all the options you could find so she can control the approach.  \n\nI think the mental and emotional labor piece are going to go a long way with her. It would have for me with my husband. I think it shows a lot about who you are and how deeply you love your wife that you would go on Reddit to find help.

I'm only a year older than your wife and I'm already starting with perimenopause and let me tell you, it ain't fun. Someday I'll have all the energy in the world and can tackle anything and then other days I have no energy. And then the mood swings suck! Sometimes I want to rip people's heads off and other times I cry when I watch Jurassic Park because the kids and the dinos are adorable! And then of course the hot flashes make life a living hell. I can't tell you how many times I have apologized to my husband and or my daughter for being a hormonal mess!  Oh and yes when the change happens, your libido can be totally messed up and sometimes barely there.\nI talked to my doctor when I realized my cycles got heavier and I started with the hot flashes and mood swings. He said that women can start perimenopause at around your wife's age and some even earlier. Not sure if any of this has helped you, I hope it does.\nMaybe what I should say is, if you're really worried maybe approach her gently about talking to the doctor. No woman likes to be told that they're getting older but it's a fact of life we all have to come to terms with. I talked to my husband first and he told me to talk to the doctor so that's what I did.\nBest of luck!",

My plan is to have 5 kids and the fifth would be born when I'm 43 years old if I'm lucky enough for everything to go right (I've only 2 right now). I think a lot about how much grief I would feel if I reach menopause before I complete my family.

I knew something was wrong because during my worst episodes I thought I might actually kill my partner. I felt insane, but was sane enough to know that it wasn't me. Knowing that you're being irrational makes it worse. I know that there's no logical reason for me to get angry at the things I'm angry about, and yet I still want to punch a wall. Being filled with rage at absolutely nothing is crazy-making. Also, diet and alcohol consumption can exacerbate it. \n\nLuckily, low-dose progesterone exists and taken 10 days before your period is immensely helpful! \n\nI had to start tracking my period (not with an App!) because, despite having had my period for 30 years, it still takes me by surprise. I would get moody, angry, clumsy and short tempered or cry for no reason and the next day start my period. \n\nMy pardner was looking at our calendar and asked me, \"What does \"Watch Out For Crazy CM\" mean?\" and I explained to them that I was reminding myself and them that I would be on my period.\n\nI hope she doesn't think you're a psycho, you sound like a very concerned and loving husband. She might know something is wrong and is too scared to admit it to you, but I think having an honest talk with her about it would benefit you both. \n\nWhen I was growing up, my stepmom was absolutely awful to me. It scarred our relationship for almost a decade. Many years ago, we were talking about PMS and she said, \"I had the worst PMS, I thought I would actually kill someone.\" The reason I bring this up is because your kids will definitely be affected and confused by her mercurial behavior.

I talked to my PCP and she said I could be extremely sensitive to the drop in hormones and the fix was partially going on a combo birth control pill consistently with no placebo break. The other fix was getting my blood tested and getting on SSRIs for anxiety and iron supplements for iron deficiency.

            "Sounds like PMDD, possibly. I highly suspect I have it myself & need to see my primary care doc about it. For years I've always felt incredibly distraught, upset, agitated, depressed, and of course suicidal in the week/week and a half before my period. When I was a kid, my period was extremely random, we're talking gaps of 2 weeks or 6 months with no rhyme or rhythm. My only cue that mine might finally be coming would be noticing how much more trouble I'd get in (at least once a day), how much more combative I was, and also how acutely miserable I felt without an obvious cause. Then, I asked myself what was so wrong with me that I'd just suddenly lose it and it felt like I couldn't reel myself in. I thought I was just a Bad Kid.\n\nNow for some godforsaken reason I have regular periods for the first time in my life, and it's been going on for a little under a year ... and I hate it so much. Before, I could have gaps of months without shark week paying a visit, now I spend at least a week a month feeling like my brain is unscrewing from my head & I can't get back on track--and then of course I feel very suicidal, lol. I already have some mental health issues so I chalked it up to that initially, but some months ago I realized that it was too time-able ... so yeah, IDK. As someone who likely has PMDD, it's hell, and dreading a week of me losing it for most of the month is also miserable. IDK if your wife has also noticed this has been a long-standing pattern with herself. Maybe once upon a time she DIDN'T have this going on & she hasn't realized there's been a shift since, hormones can fluctuate for lots of reasons. But I would bring it up with her and point out that you've noticed a pattern, maybe ask her if her depression & other symptoms get notably worse  at any point in time, if she's also noticed trends, etc. \n\nIt really took me being more regular to notice how I could spend a week in hell like clockwork, before I just assumed I had behavioral issues. If she doesn't know that some people DON'T have this specific problem & this never happens to them, she might not realize it's unusual, nevermind diagnosable. After all, most descriptions of periods & hormones are just that it sucks and you'll feel bad, it's not often that someone gets into the nitty gritty of pointing out when and how feeling bad is unusual. Also, if she already has experience with depression symptoms, she might just assume that it's part of her other mental health stuff and not a unique diagnosis. Which also might mean she assumes that what she needs to do to keep herself in check is just regular depression management (and maybe she thinks she's just not doing a good job of it when that dreaded week hits), vs. realizing that with a different diagnosis, different management is also required.\n\nEDIT, just saw your note about your wife being resistant to treatment: \n\nAs someone who's done 7 years of therapy, tried 20+ meds while trying to figure out how to manage myself, done more than one psych assessments to sort out what I had going on & how I ought to be treated for it ... yeah, doing all this sucks, there's no way around it. It's a lot of trial and error. Having said that, now that I'm at a point where I have some meds that DO help and therapy HAS helped me solve problems, even if it took a few years to feel like I was learning good tools ... I don't regret the journey. I am grateful to my past self for not giving up. Feeling even halfway better after 7 years is worth a lot more to me than not trying anything for god knows how long and never getting anywhere. I also don't think I would have made it if I hadn't been doing something--anything--to try and pull myself out of the hole I was in. It's dark and cold down at the bottom of an abyss.",
            "Has she always been like this or has it gotten worse over time? I agree with other people saying PMDD is likely, but I want to add that I was also like this before I started my ADHD medication. For some reason treating the ADHD made my PMS much better. Another thing that happened to me is that the symptoms related to my menstrual cycle got way more pronounced (both the PMS but also the libido increase around ovulation) when my thyroid suddenly went overactive. Things have gotten much better since I got treatment for my hyperthyroidism, so it might be worth it to get the thyroid hormones checked out.",

            "Darling, you\u2019ve done all this work. You\u2019ve probably figured out that she is not in tune or self-regulating at all while experiencing the cycle. \n\nTBH, she might have something major or traumatic from her past to overcome if she really  pays no attention to or blames others for her anger. You can\u2019t just put someone on SSRIs or say \u201chey, you have this\u2026 figure it out\u201d and hope that will cause them to be self-aware.\n\nI have severe PMDD and I can recognize in myself all of my emotions that I inhabit and all of the emotions that come from a source in my life versus a hormonal source. It\u2019s painfully deteriorating to be overcome by those darkest hormonal emotions and to have to inception your feelings because they do feel legitimate. Every. Single. Time. \n\nI hear you that she is a genuinely good human, but she\u2019s also showing some signs of abusiveness. Abed would concur: the mean things are happening and you see their impact.\n\nI\u2019m just trying to think about her reaction: you tracking her cycle, making these observations, you really wanting to get to the stop of the core hurtful behaviors. Are you afraid she won\u2019t take it well? You\u2019re saying she\u2019s letting her body control her mind and her hormones are acting as  another person that everyone in the family has to respond to and be hyperaware of. That walking on eggshell behavior is associated with people who are narcissistic: did she have to deal with someone intense who she always had to have her guard up around in childhood or teenage years? She could be acting out what she could never have been. Hormones also make women have less control over their basest emotional drives: when we have less control, we go instinctual and we wound when we feel wounded and vulnerable.\n\nSorry if this is not helpful. I was just thinking about my own life and how my older sister was just like your wife. She gives too much materially  and sacrificially of herself because that\u2019s how she sees herself as being lovable: love is transactional to her because she always feels compelled to earn it. \n\nI guess the whopping concern you also have is the sexless part of every month: start there. Make her feel appreciated and beautiful. Buy her a great dinner where you make all the plans, reservations, childcare in the not so hot part of the month (just not two or three days before her menstruation) so that she gets emotionally horny. Two or three days before her menstruation, treat her like an angel and bring her kind things. Hold her those days. Reintroduce touch intimacy and not intercourse at that time in the month, and without saying a word you show her she\u2019s needed and wanted. \n\nI hope she warms to the subtleties you provide her in care as opposed to a whole stressful confrontation. By being a presence of touch and comfort, grabbing her hand, having an arm around her, kissing her deeply every day, good hugs, massage, tickling, she\u2019ll not feel as unbalanced. Women feel extremely unbalanced when they don\u2019t feel loved enough. \n\nWhen you always ask yourself (not her aloud because that means she has to solve the problem):\u201dhow can I help you when you get angry or sad?\u201d you improve communication. \n\nYou\u2019re doing the Lord\u2019s work. Honestly it\u2019s pretty genius that you discovered this. But now you can\u2019t piss her off or sour her to this information like it\u2019s a problem she has to fix. You just need to show her more love and take care of her, love her most deeply, when she is at her worst and weakest. She lashes out when she\u2019s most vulnerable. Take special care of her. It\u2019s obvious you love her: now use that love to multiply between the two of you! You\u2019re extremely capable of that.",

I've told her in the past something like, \"I have noticed that there are times you are so happy and full of life and there are times where you won't hardly talk to me and every aspect of our life seems to make you mad.  Is there something that happens that sparks the negative side or is it just something that kind of bubbles up?\" and she chalks it up to outside stresses or sometimes she'll say that she's having a hard time with the city where we live because it's not her hometown.  But if we're in a \"good phase\" she sings the praises of where we live, so it was always hard to chalk it up to these outside influences for me since it seemed like whether these things were good or bad depended on the moment.",

She is also just generally more receptive to medical interventions that don't feel so \"take a pill and go away\".  I wouldn't say she's anti-medicine, but \"natural\" medicine doesn't seem to get the same skepticism from her that she reserves for Rx interventions.  She's definitely more comfortable with medical conversations involving hormones, thyroid function, and vitamins/supplements vs. medications and surgeries (generally, not necessarily for this issue).",

This was 20 years ago and it's my understanding that there is more awareness now, but I wish that I had paid better attention to my menstrual cycle before assuming I had a mood disorder.

I also briefly got put on antipsychotics but I also didn\u2019t like that either. I don\u2019t think it has to be necessary to take these drugs if you don\u2019t want to. \n\nBut I have to stress that instead of taking these drugs, I invested an extreme amount of time into therapy. I did a 14 month outpatient program of Dialectical Behavioural therapy which helped me a lot with controlling my behaviour and being able to sit with upsetting and uncomfortable feelings. It also taught me to not make choices that might make me feel better short term but will be worse long term.\n\nI also have a bad time with hormonal birth control, they increase my migraines and cause really extreme gastrointestinal disturbances for me. So at the moment until I can find an alternative, I take the birth control from\nabout the 15th day onwards until I get my period and it does help curb things. \n\nWhat was the most useful however was actually getting the diagnosis. I used to feel so crazy because I couldn\u2019t understand why  I felt so bad, not knowing when it was going to end. But knowing things have an end date helped me to push through it. I also totally abstain from alcohol.\n\nI\u2019ve heard stories from other women who have ended up getting hysterectomies because they can\u2019t tolerate SSRI or birth control. And that it changed their lives.\n\nYour wife needs to start having conversations with medical professionals to get a diagnosis and discuss options. If she refuses, please don\u2019t just let it go. I promise you that your child will suffer, you will suffer.",
            "My husband and I have each been resistant to medicating psychological issues. That's incredibly common. But there came a point for each of us, where we had a \"come to Jesus\" talk about how we were being impacted, and how our marriage was taking damage. In each case, that was a massive wakeup call; we may be stubborn about our own suffering and self loathing, but the idea of causing damage to our marriage is fucking terrifying.\n\nSomething else that helped was establishing that medication doesn't have to be forever. But it's a crucial demonstration of love and commitment to put your own ego aside and try *all* avenues for help, including medication, when you know your partner is being impacted. All you're asking is to talk to a doctor and be open to giving medication a shot for whatever period of time the doctor recommends. If the medication doesn't work, or if the issue gets resolved in another way, discontinuation of medication is still going to be on the table.\n\nAlso, look into the Mirena IUD. It's a much lower dose of hormones released really consistently, as opposed to larger doses hitting your digestive system via the pill. Even if she had a bad experience with the pill or the shot, she may have a better experience with an IUD.\n\nSit her down and tell her you love her deeply, but you and the kids are being impacted by her mood swings you don't want to put off addressing it any longer. Obviously do this during her 'up' period. And instead of getting out of the house to avoid her when she's being shitty, stay and take it, and give her a calm *look*. She'll probably lash out at you because she'll be ashamed when you 'let' her be shitty. Stop getting out of the way of her shittiness; it's helping her stay in denial. She's not going to get help as long as you're enabling her. I promise, the previous conversation will be on her mind in the background, and she'll realize she doesn't want to act in a way that makes her ashamed any longer.",
            "I have a friend who has struggled with PMDD from her teens onwards. Hormonal birth control helped her a lot. She decided to quit a few years ago as she'd been on the pills for over a decade and to see where her body was at in the lead-up to wanting to conceive. \n\nFrom what I understood it was pretty brutal on her mental health. What did help a lot was knowing what it was and that it was temporary. It was such a large portion of the month though that it wasn't sustainable. \n\nAs she wanted to conceive going back on birth control wasn't an option, so she went the \"health route\". She got help from a professional and I don't know all the ins and outs... what I do know is that she initially completely cut out alcohol and sugar/heavily processed foods, limited her caffeine intake and really prioritized sleep, mindfulness and exercise. There were probably other things and some supplements. I don't think her cycles are completely trouble-free now and she still has rougher months, but they have greatly improved.",

One made me manic which was productive but not fantastic for me emotionally).\u00a0\n\nA mix of therapy, lavender oil (there\u2019s studies to back this up for anxiety), and mindfulness techniques have made my life much more calm and enjoyable. I also don\u2019t eat processed food, I quit smoking, and I drink very infrequently. I also left a job 4 years ago that was sucking the life out of me, and that helped a lot. I also have a supportive partner. It sounds like you are that!\n\nPlease talk to your wife.

            "It might be worth looking into some of the newer birth control options vs. older ones? \n\nI don't know what she was doing previously, but some of the pills that were really common 10-20 years ago would do a sugar pill week where you wouldn't get any hormones so that you would basically schedule a period. If she struggles with the dip, that might not have been the best fit? A lot of the newer things like IUDs or implants etc. will have just like a steady continuous slow release, and can also decrease the intensity of periods a lot, or remove them altogether \u2013 just depending on the person. \n\nI think they've also changed some of the dosages and offer slightly different hormone types now than they used to \u2013 so it's possible that the option that she tried previously just wasn't the right one for her. Totally anecdotal, but when I let my implant wear out during the pandemic, I definitely realized that the kind of steady level of release had been masking a lot of PMDD symptoms.",

I didn\u2019t want to go back on hormonal birth control because I was starting to have really bad headaches every month with them. \n\nI would almost monthly spend an entire day in bed sobbing. I would lash out at people. Minor inconveniences made me feel uncontrollable anger. \n\nI was diagnosed with PMDD, and while I\u2019m not against meds, I wasn\u2019t super keen to go on them.\n\nI did end up going on an SSRI (Zoloft) - but only for 14 days at a time (lining up with the luteal phase of my cycle) and at a low dose.  I liked the fact that I didn\u2019t feel like I was building any sort of dependency. Aside from a few days of night sweats each month, I had no undesirable side effects and it made a MASSIVE difference in my quality of life and I\u2019m sure the people close to me felt the same. \n\nI also ended up stopping the Zoloft. I started having really terrible insomnia and I thought maybe that was a factor.  Stopping the Zoloft did not fix my insomnia. But, I think maybe my hormones leveled out to some degree because my moods were never as bad as when I first came off the pill. \n\nIt took around 3 years for me to get to this point.  And I feel like if I didn\u2019t end up taking the meds when I did that I really could have fucked my life up. I wanted to quit my job and leave my husband once a month because I just felt like I hated everything in my life. \n\nI would try to find a way to gently bring this up to your wife - wait for a good point in her cycle though haha.  \n\nAs much as she\u2019s making those around her suffer, I promise it\u2019s even worse for her.  You could mention that you\u2019ve noticed her PMS is a little more extreme since stopping birth control and ask if she\u2019s talked to her doctor about it. Come at it from a place of being curious and concerned - which it sounds like you already are. \n\nShe might be open to the idea of a medication that she doesn\u2019t have to become reliant on. I never would have known that was a thing if I hadn\u2019t brought up to my OBGYN what a struggle I was having. \n\nI hope you all figure it out together. I wouldn\u2019t wish what I experienced on anyone! And I don\u2019t think PMDD gets talked about or researched nearly as much as it should.\n\nWishing you the best!!",

            "People with PMDD often struggle with birth control, but a birth control containing Drospirenone instead of other types of Progestins have been shown to be more effective. There are some risks though.",
            "Now look up how PMDD/luteal phase is impacted by the onset of slightly dropping hormones during and right before perimenopause begins.  Learn about perimenopause, and menopause and the cognitive decline that can be experienced on top of her PMS/PMDD as that phase of her life edges closer. Even if she\u2019s not peri currently, her cycle likely began becoming additionally harder and more emotional the last year or so (and will continue to get worse without the right support).  A lot of women describe it as though they were secretly concerned that they were experiencing the onset of dementia. \n\nBut here\u2019s the other piece to keep in mind - when you said that her cycle is different than other women\u2019s/partners\u2019 cycles, are you sure that that\u2019s the case? I\u2019m not suggesting there isn\u2019t an issue (I think regardless she could use more support during certain parts of her cycle, and she\u2019s clearly struggling).  I\u2019m simply curious if you actually have the insight you think you do.  \n\nBecause unless a man does what you did, and tracks these details of his wife\u2019s moods and such, and does it with a woman he lives with and is romantically involved with, how would he know? You had to write it down each day and care enough to do this.  Most obgyns aren\u2019t even that attuned to anyone, much less men or society being aware of how our bodies work, it being really normal discourse to compare with others, after such careful detailing.  \n\nWelcome to the plight of womanhood, where we get to spend most of our adult lives beyond our childbearing years, while medicine only bothered to learn the basics of how our bodies work as long as we can serve as incubators lol \ud83d\ude44\u2026So get ready to get really frustrated for the sake of someone you love as you learn about it all.  There\u2019s more info on these topics accessible than there was even 5 yrs ago, so keep looking into all of this, it\u2019s not all easy to find but the medical field is finally making a small amount of progress in this arena\n\nLastly, thank you for being a man who cares this much about your female partner that you would go to that length to better understand her and support her.  The world could use more men like you\u2026",

            "Firstly, it\u2019s awesome that you took the time to track her moods to understand what could be causing the ups and downs. She doesn\u2019t even need to take SSRIs the whole time, just during her luteal phase. I take the lowest dose possible. I can\u2019t even begin to express how much better I feel and how it has drastically improved my relationship with my husband. He was the one who sat me down during my follicular phase and very calmly told me he was worried about me and how my behavior was harming me, him, and our relationship. The timing he chose definitely helped get through to me. I would encourage you to tell her to talk to a doctor and help figure out what the best approach would be for her.",

            "Hi OP, I responded earlier but I\u2019ll let you know what worked for me:\n\n- Therapy for anxiety. Aside from worrying a lot I would spiral and go into a depression like funk that just took hours to climb out of. During this time I would cry, be angry, be resentful and feel awful. Therapy helped me figure out tools to help me cope when I spiral so I don\u2019t continue negative thinking patterns or hurt my partner. \n\n- Birth control. Continuous birth control made my PMDD symptoms go away almost entirely. I would still spiral and be anxious but gone were the days waking up just wanting to cry and isolate myself for no absolutely no reason. \n\n- SSRIs. I\u2019m on 15 mg of Lexapro for anxiety. Spiraling and panic attacks have all but mostly ceased and when they do occur they are much more manageable. I find myself using my therapy techniques less and less because I simply don\u2019t spiral into depressive episodes. I sleep better, touch feels better, my mood is better, I do not think the worst of my partner, I do not have any reason to cry or lash out for no reason.",

It made my symptoms better for a little bit, but then I would crash, and become extremely depressed and anxious. SSRI low dose daily during the month, and then double it about a week to 10 days before my period when I start to notice breakthrough symptoms. And then I taper back down to low dose once a day once my period starts. I also was very against psych meds, but I couldn\u2019t believe the difference I felt after just 2 weeks of starting it. I felt like a different person, like I was finding myself again and I wasn\u2019t enslaved to my mood swings that I couldn\u2019t control",

I\u2019m throwing this out there on the off chance it may help, but it really might be useless. I take famotidine from ovulation to menstruation.

I remember evening primrose oil featuring heavily. I\u2019m sure there are a variety of natural supplements that may help your partner - they aren\u2019t likely to be as successful as pharmaceutical medications - but it\u2019s a start. My sister has inherited the condition and takes a very low dose of antidepressants in the 2 weeks before her period. No side effects, but a massive difference in her mood and behaviour. \n\nMy Mum passed about 7 years ago - even then she didn\u2019t know that PMDD existed - she just thought she was a bad person and a bad mother.

I choose to treat with natural remedies, mostly change of lifestyle, eating clean, meditation/stress relief techniques, I used maca for hormonal balance and some Ayurvedic treatment. There are alternatives out there which are more sustainable in the long run. They also take longer to come in effect. It's not like a med that in shor time you see drastic changes. It took me about 8months but the change is long lasting and improved many other aspects of my health (mental and physical).",

(I also have bipolar type 2 so it's kind of hard to say; but I would get horrendously depressed in the 7-10 days before my period, every single month.) Mirena completely changed my life. I no longer have much of a hormonal cycle at all, I haven't had a period in over ten years. The insertion is painful but I would rather die than go without Mirena. Now I can just focus on treating my bipolar disorder and not worry about the mood impact of my cycle. You should really consider it.",

He's read articles, he's listened to me talk about it at length, listened about how much it's damaged my life. It has been a journey but he's been more than understanding. But there are still times where I lose it on him and he just stands there and looks at me and lets me scream at him and call him names until it clicks in my head what I'm doing and then I feel horrible. There have been a few times when it was really bad that he has left the room and just calmly stood in the other room and by the time I went to go after him it clicked what I was doing. He usually hugs me while I cry. With working really hard on myself and my behaviors and tracking my period so that I know when things are going to go downhill emotionally and his understanding, my episodes have become fewer and less intense. I have learned to talk about the scary place I go during my episodes instead of just suffering through it alone because I don't think anyone will understand. Understanding what is going on and changing your behaviors is the biggest part of dealing with it.",

Part of the way women's experiences tend to be discounted at the doctor's office is that their sexual health is not prioritized.\n\nThere's more than enough evidence laid out to support a PMDD diagnosis without the sex part.",

I did visit with that intention but always backed out.\n\nI have been visiting my sister in law recently as I like her and she was never terrible, always told her husband ( my exs brother) off when he was nasty to me. Her husband is away atm so I can visit her and we get on great.\n\nYesterday she said something weird.\n\nTurns out they knew I left but he told them we were back together and they believed him.\n\nThey thought he was mister wonderful husband and father and I was a b\\*tch.\n\nThey would phone him, arrange to visit and he would meet them in town and say I was busy.\n\nWe lived a few hours away so the visits were not often.\n\nThey had no idea we were short of heat etc.\n\nNo wonder exs brother refused to pay for the funeral and was nasty to me.\n\nI cant say they were extreme nasty to our ( all exs children no suggestion they were not exs that I know of) although when visiting last week my daughter saw a photo of ex when ex was young and gasped at how identical her brother is to ex and SIL made a very strange grimace face, that just struck me as I write this) children at the funeral, just not sympatric  - they were polite but the atmosphere was way off, BIL was downright rude to me at the funeral. SIL told him off. \n\nSo last night when I visited SIL now in her 80s and she asked a direct very surprising question I told her we were divorced in the 90s and he was nasty and cruel and stole from me and fooled me into lending him money and stuck me with his debts, what can I say, Im stupid and I know it. I paid his debts when I could not prove they were his not mine and lent him money so he could buy a car to get to work, never repaid of course. I got a loan for the car when I got a job.\n\nIn laws thought he was living with us and paying everything. Children never got so much as a birthday card, no presents, no pocket money from ex unless one of his girlfriends was around then he would make a big fuss in front of them and give them money.\n\nBrother in law is living in  a Retirement Home now.\n\n SIL is living alone so visiting her has been weird as I didnt want to upset her but do like her and wanted to know why they were so weird and rude to me. I never did get up the courage to  ask a direct question, thats why I like SIL, she is very forthright and did ask a question which led to this discovery.\n\nI visited last night on my own. SIL is discrete enough not to ask a question when her hubby or my children were present. \n\nMy daughter was not with me when I visited last night. I told my daughter what SIL said when I got home.\n\nWe are both reeling and so is SIL.\n\nNow my daughter wants to phone BIL and make sure he knows I am not a B\\*tch.\n\nDaughter is very relieved as now she knows it was her dead ( Freudian slip Im keeping it , I meant to write dad not dead) telling more lies and maybe her aunt and uncle might be decent people who stayed away due to her dads lies not because they didnt care.\n\nSo many years of resentment and anger due to exs lies.\n\nWaiting now to see if BIL says anything or will just brush it off.\n\nVery glad I never threw out the tapes of EXs threats. Now I have to check they work as they are ancient.\n\nBIL thinks his brother was the best thing ever on this planet so I doubt he will believe he was anything less.Writing as I needed to vent and organise my thoughts ( not sure it worked im still confused and reeling) \n\nIm in my 60s now and had a hard life. I just want to sort things out, have lies about me settled and maybe have a nice uncle and aunt for my children even if they are not young anymore.\n\nMy daughter wants my BIL to apologise to her mother for being rude to me at her dads funeral. BIL met my daughter for the first time since she was a baby at the funeral and was very weird with her, I can see why now as daughter was not upset her \"loving father\" was dead. He must have thought we were a family of monsters, no wonder he was rude. Daughter wants to put that right.\n\nWriting as I needed to vent and organise my thoughts ( not sure it worked im still confused and reeling) \n\nNot sure if Im rambling but will post anyway to vent. I did my best to make sense.\n\n\n\n",

            "A little confused why you are surprised. This guy mistreated you and your little ones on all levels, it's in line that he also lied about his (and your) actions when you finally left. The whole point was revenge on you, including cutting off any help any family could offer. \n\nSince you are still so high up in the emotions and so are your kids, see where this goes with the ex relatives. Overall, you'd probably all be better off in counseling and finding your closure there though. Your BIL has had certain opinions for all this time, your ex is dead, your kids are now grown... it's no longer time they will want to get back. The moment to ask was when their sibling died and his kids were fatherless, and they would rather believe you were a horrible person instead of inquire. Big chance that you won't be getting any of the acknowledgement you're hoping for. So reach out to your supports and build up again from there.",

            "Yes, I think you may be right.\n\nI was just too busy surviving to think what he was saying about me.\n\nI just thought they werent interested as they never had children even though they wanted them. Maybe seeing me with mine upset them so that seemed a reason to me for them not to get involved.\n\nI would like to know what BIL says. \n\nI have the tapes, he does not need to listen to them if he dosent want.\n\nIt upsets me that he thinks Im a b\\*tch. I want him put right. Even if he does not accept it."

But both of these objects are commonly used for penis exercises. There are a few communities here on reddit where you can read about it. The fact you don\u2019t see him using it in your personal life makes me suspect this is what he does with it. I own both things as well and never use them for sex (or what some people have insinuated, to prepare for sex). It\u2019s also slightly embarrassing. The fact you say he has a large penis is completely unrelated to how he feels about it. \nGoogle \u2018penis exercise pump reddit\u2019 and look at the results.\n\n\nNow I\u2019m obviously not saying he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, in the end you will know best.

I would have called bullshit then and there.\n\nNow he\u2019s taking them on work trips? How long are these work trips? Most work trips are a few days or a week at most. Surely he can survive without his precious penis pump for a few days. But nope. He\u2019s gotta take them. It\u2019s very clear why. They\u2019re not for him to use solo.

            "> Why take them for the work trip?\n\nHe's already using them when he's alone, at home. Meaning: You KNOW he likes them for solo play.\n\nOn the work trip, he's going to have alone time.\n\nI'm a 40 year old man, and I could see myself doing something like this, except for the fear of potential embarrassment at the airport. If it was a driving trip, I'd strongly consider bringing my toys for solo play.",
            "She's found other things (conversations planning meet ups) and he was on POF/CL soliciting sex in 2015. I'd have a hard time believing it's harmless given that context.",
            "Exactly! Who the hell brings anything other than themselves to hook up. It would be super weird.",
            "Because he's using them as stretchers probably. He's getting older and concerned about his equipment. Pretty normal thing to be embarrassed about.",
            "Not pleasurable while pumping it up. But quite pleasurable after using it to get it there, use the ring to keep it there, and go to town on himself.",
            "I replied to a commenter below. Please read it when you can. I apologize in advance if I am too blunt or too harsh. But you deserve to know the facts. Simply put: a penis pump and/or cock ring will never be a \"maintenance\" device. It's just physically not possible. The circulatory system does not work that way. At all.",
            "Just like when women catch their men with condoms in their suitcase \u2026 they come up with all sorts of things to lie it away. But you know deep down what is up.",
            "FYI I did go to nursing school. I don't claim to be a medical expert in urology. BUT, I am not debating that penis pumps are effective. The issue here, relating to OP's issue, is that what they are effective for is obtaining and maintaining an erection. Temporarily. I'm trying to come up with an analogy to explain it so bear with me here. Think of it like a penis pump/cock ring is an ice cube. I want a cold drink. I want that cold drink now. But that drink isn't going to stay cold forever. It's not going to magically make all my drinks cold. An ice cube is not a permanent solution.\n\nI hope that makes sense. A penis pump/cock ring are temporary solutions to achieve and maintain an erection. Without them, you are not going to be able to sustain that on your own. The concept of this being \"maintenance\" is silly, same as expecting one ice cube to cool down all drinks. The way they both work is primarily through the circulatory system. For a penis pump, it draws in blood flow to the penis to create an erection/firmer erection. For a cock ring, once the blood flow is in, this traps the blood in the penis to be able to maintain that erection. However, that has no lasting effect on the functionality of the penis. It is temporary. Without these devices, the circulatory system doesn't suddenly know to divert blood flow to the penis... just because, reasons? \n\nTo put it bluntly, these devices serve one purposes alone: blood flow in to get an erection temporarily to get \"the job\" done. We all know what the job is, and it's not the wife, OP sorry to be blunt again. If he's trying to gaslight you into thinking these devices are meant to \"maintain\" his sexual health, he's lying.\n\nI just want to add, that FUCK embarrassment, for any man out there who may be experiencing difficulty obtaining or maintaining an erection, if you are in a committed relationship, it is ABSOLUTELY a concern for your partner as well. These issues are often related to serious health issues, such as hypertension, other circulatory issues, diabetes, prostrate problems, hormonal imbalances, etc. Studies show that approximately 80% of the time ED is caused by a physical and treatable issue. If you can't talk to your partner about these things, what kind of open, honest, loving relationship are you in? The answer is obvious there.\n\nBut in OP's case, he's gaslighting you. He's using the penis pump and cock ring to get it up for someone else. You cannot permanently change the way your blood flow works through a temporary device so to say this is \"maintenance\" is... well, horse shit.",
            ">On the contrary, why did he take them on the 2-day trip? \n\nTo use on himself? I mean, it doesn't make much sense to take them if you intend to hook up with a random person. It also doesn't make much sense to me to take them on the trip for a planned rendezvous. \n\nI have an automatic masturbator toy and not a penis pump. I've never brought it to bed with my lady friend. I don't chat about it casually with her or anyone really...except some distraught random person on Reddit. Not that I'm hiding something, it's just a personal toy and not a conversation starter.\n\nI'm pretty open about sexuality but I can't say as I've ever heard of a man using a penis pump in bed with a partner. They are generally used in private, to attempt to increase length and girth which is silly. The penis doesn't work like that. Cock rings? Maybe he likes to edge while he masturbates. I mean there could be any number of reasons he has these toys and took them with him. I just don't see jumping to the conclusion that he is cheating. \n\nI mean, women take their toys all over the place. Doesn't indicate that they are cheating. It just indicates a higher libido.",
