            "Minoxidil isn't helping I guess?\n\nSo, This is kind of long journey., \n\nI have been facing hairfall issue for over a decade now, since I was 15. That's when I started noticing hairs here and there, hairs coming out everytime I put my hands through them. That time I didn't have much of a money or knowledge to deal it, So, I looked for what not to do, so, i stopped putting oil on my scalp frequently or washing my hairs sometimes covering them out.\n\nNow after a decade, still I don't have a bald patch but I can see that I have lost reasonable amount of hairs.. and for other people to notice it, that will happen, if I wet my hairs.\n\nNow, during the COVID times i realised that my hairloss is mainly because of pollution and dust that's causing me different allergy and dandruff on my scalp.\n\nSo, fast forward to this year i talked with the dermatologist about it,  and they suggested a anti dandruff lotion and ketoconozole shampoo for a month, so that they can clean up my scalp before starting with further treatment and advise me to wash hairs twice a week, which i usually did( once atleast and twice most. ) now after a month I was genuinely surprised that the dandruff was all gone. So i mentioned this to them and they told me let's start with minoxidil.\n\nNow, I have read some good reviews and stuff about minoxidil and i know that, if your hairs respond to the treatment well you'll see the results on your hairline in around 6 months, and again when you start with minoxidil at beginning you will encounter some hairfall\nBut this is too much, I mean for first 2_3 weeks i thought okay my scalp is responding to the treatment and I'm loosing my weak hairs, but now after a month of using it, i don't see it stopping, further more I see I have more hairloss than I had since the beginning of this treatment.\n\n I was thinking about using only shampoo and lotion for sometime now( a month maybe) and see how it goes... Only issue is I have curly hair, and when they're dry after shower they'll be all dry and look pretty bad and not well maintained, so that's not a good condition either.\n\nI'm not sure about minoxidil, I was using it 1-2 ml before bed, every night till Friday.

What are you guys' recommendations? Do any of you know approximately how many grafts would restore my hair and possibly lower hairline a bit? Do any of you have a similar situation with fin and switched to lower doses and the sides disappeared ? Do I need to see a dermatologist before transplant or to get further help? How helpful are dermatologists? Any guidance and/or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.",

I stopped for a while and now I'm continuing. I feel like I'm catching up with finasteride's side effects. So, I'm planning to go for the topical Min + Finasterdie solution. The question is, which one should I get? Morr F 5%, Mintop Gain+5, Tugain Men?\n\nMy previous Min 5% was a bit sticky but it dries pretty fast. Also it had nice smell. I heard Morr F smelled horrible. Which one would you suggest guys?",

( I have long hair so it's more visible ) I felt like now is the best time to deal with it. I have attached pictures of my scalp with bright lights and low lights. I am not sure where to start, should I just start with finasteride only ? Or should I add minoxidil with finasteride too ? I don't think I could deal with the daily routine of topical minoxidil considering I have long hair, it would be a pain to keep up overtime. I feel like oral finasteride could be my best option. But I am open to advices , also I live in the UK, would you recemmond visiting a dermatologist who deals with hair first? Or should I just order finasteride online , which websites are good for Finasteride in the UK ?  I do know they would ask for a prescription , but after getting that cleared, which brand of finasteride is good. Same for minoxidil. I do know about hims , but they mix Finasteride and minoxidil together, and I rather not have them mixed , but rather see which works out best.\n\nAny help advice would be greatly appreciated\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5mzmaf7bos4d1.jpeg?width=3464&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f3484a00f55cbd6c804e0463bc40dcb350c4660",

While min, preferably oral, might give me more density like it did with my mom, I'm afraid it might not \"unrecede\" my hairline even just a bit. Has anyone had an unreceding hairline on min?

            "Best topical Finasteride/Minoxidil solution in Europe?\n\nIm thinking about starting topical finasteride, but in Europe we only have sth called \u201eFynzur\u201c which  is way too concentrated (2.275mg/ml). My plan is to do a 0.025% topical Fin, is there an option without having to crack the oral pills to do the topical? Supposing, i used this fynzur to do the 0.025% Fin, could someone pls check my calculations?\n\nAs far as i know, Fynzur contains 9ml (0.05ml/spray burst \u2014> 180 spray bursts in total)\n\nEach burst contains 0.114mg Finasteride, therefore in total 20.52 mg of Fin in 9ml solution. \n\nMy solvent would be 5% minoxidil ( 50mg/ml, in total 60ml in 1 bottle)\n\nSo I take out 6.7ml of the minoxidil and fill in 6.7ml of Fynzur, which would make a Fin concentration of 6.7 * 2.275mg = 15.2425mg/60ml = ~0.254mg/ml (which is approximately the desired 0.25mg/ml.)\n\n\nWith the 6.7ml of minoxidil missing, its concentration would now only be 44.41mg/ml (compared to 50mg/ml before).

After seeing a dermatologist, who told me it should come back, I stopped minoxidil to see if my hair would come back naturally. Which it actually did, partially. Today, my hair density on the top of my head is still 50% less than normal. I called VIVUS and they basically told me that at the 7.5 dose, 3% of the sample size who took Qsymia experienced alopecia.

            "Should I start minoxidil or wait for finasteride to take effect?\n\n\nHello everyone, I am a 22M, and in November 2023, I began experiencing a period of Telogen Effluvium following a health problem. From November to February, I was losing hundreds of hairs a day, including from the sides and back of my head, as well as eyelashes, eyebrows, and body hair. Starting in March, this drastically reduced, and by the end of April, the hair on the sides, back, and top of my scalp had regrown even thicker than before. During these months, I had blood tests done and treated deficiencies like Vitamin D and increased my protein intake.\n\n\nNow, the problem is that since the end of May, I have noticed a new increase in hair loss concentrated in the crown area. Yes, it had thickened but never returned to pre-TE levels, in normal daylight it doesn't look like it's thinning. Similarly, the corners of my hairline, especially the left one, never recovered and looks like a thinning Norwood 1, while the right one had improved a bit but is at least a thinning Norwood 0.5 (I consider Norwood 0 to be the hairline I had before November 2023, which hadn't changed since I was a child). That being said, I am almost certain that the TE episode has unmasked male pattern baldness, which I would have noticed much later.\n\n\nIn a couple of days, I have an appointment with a dermatologist/trichologist during which I would like to ask for a prescription for finasteride. Do you think it is enough to stop the hair loss and perhaps thicken both temples to almost pre-TE levels, as well as the crown? Or should I also start using minoxidil at the same time?

So I'm 22 and within the last six months I realized I was shedding much more than I ever had after I started using shampoo (herbal essence) for the first time in years. I was also more stressed than I've ever been as I was coming up on the end of college so l attributed it to those two factors. I swapped to a hair loss shampoo and conditioner however I realized that due to the reduced volume caused by the conditioner the thinness was more obvious so about a month ago I went back to not using any products anymore. I showed the loss to my doctor and he said it certainly could've had something to do with the shampoo and stress and that my follicles look totally healthy they're just don't have hair. He didn't recommend anything just made that observation and encouraged me to switch to baby shampoo which was kind of a moot point since I was done with products. My hair is a big part of me and l've been very self conscious about it and I'm wondering if I should do something or if I'm freaking out over nothing. Thanks!",

            "Hey, everyone. I've been on the standard dutasteride dose of 0.5 mg every day; it's only been a little over a month and I am already seeing bits of regrowth. The thing with me is that I have naturally curly hair and diffuse thinning (I'd say I am in between a NW1 and NW2), and I am really considering taking a dose higher than the recommended one to speed up results. I suspect I might experience a shed though, and I don't want to do anything unnecessarily, so I'm wondering if anyone could offer any advice regarding this. Thanks.",
            "I went to my dermatologist mid-April. After examination, she prescribed me Finasteride 1 mg: one pill **each 3 days**. On this community, many, if not all, use 1 mg **per day**.\n\nI'm worried (username checks out) about this. To be honest, after 2 months, I experienced the famous Fin shedding (since, let's say 1.5 month). So, I don't know.\n\nI'm also using Min 2.5% at night. I used to only take Min 5% two times a day (since 2018), but I reduced since my appointment.\n\nAlso, another concern, she said, after saying me to use Fin, that \"I can stop\" Min. People here seems to use both products.\n\nI'm super confused.\n\nP.S. I want to stop Min too because it dries my hair so bad.",

            "Am I doing too much finasteride? \n\nI was prescribed 2.5mg of minoxidil to take take orally twice a day, as well as 0.05% fluocinonide for my receding hair line. That has been my treatment for a little over a year and it has helped with thinning hair on my scalp but my receding hairline has only stopped in its tracks. I haven't seen any noticable progress at my hairline. I want to see more regrowth at the hairline, so I was additionally prescribed 1mg of oral finasteride to take twice daily. Is 1mg fin twice a day too much? I have only been taking it for three days and I've already noticed a huge decrease in my libido and diminished orgasms. Could reducing the amount I take mitigate these side effects? I've been reading that others take 1mg fin either once a day or three times a week and still see positive results; should I try doing that? Should I even bother starting finasteride after a year of decent results with minoxidil?",

Its scary to me.\n\nMore helpful info: I notice shed begun shortly after i start taking new batch of fin (im taking fin Recur even at the start i was taking it) and i also at that time stop taking isotretinoin (i was taking the smallest dosage for acne issues 20mg).

This is only temporary but might make the hair appear worse, but long term your hair will be better.\n\n>Should I continue using them consistently?\n\nYes\n\n>Could this be some type of vitamin deficiency?\n\nVitamin deficiencies could cause hair loss, but this is very rare. Usually, it's male pattern baldness.\n\n>Could this be Telogen effluvium? Or caused by medication use (opiates).

Also, try to get your vitamin stuff sorted out in the meantime.\n\n>or should I just accept that I'm balding all over my head?\n\nIt is likely that you are balding, you should stick to treatment and get your health figured out.

So it's too early to tell how effective Finasteride is yet.\n\n>Should I switch to oral finasteride instead?\n\nOral would probably be more effective then topical, but it's up to you. If you find topical more convenient, then I wouldn't change.\n\n>Is there any hope at this point?\n\nThat's for you to decide, it depends how much you value your hair. \n\nI would stay on Finasteride for at least a year(as well as keep using the minoxidil), then reassess.\n\n\nIf you still aren't getting the results you want after a year, then you could switch from Finasteride to Dutasteride. You could even look into a hair transplant later on too.

Oral min shouldn't be too bad if you and your doctor are keeping up on things, but topical is definitely safer if you don't want to take any risk. \n\n>Should i derma stamp in the mean time?\n\nOne of the main benefits of dermstamping is supposed to be increased absorption of topicals like min. \n\nAlso, it's not as important as fin or min, so it's not really necessary. You could just stick to fin for now and add min down the line like you planned, and you'll be fine.",

Anyway I can grow my hair back thicker and fuller?\n\nIf it's actually hair loss from stress, it would recover in about 6-12 months after the stressful period.

The ones who are bald everywhere are at really advanced stages of baldness\n\nThinning in more than one area isn't that uncommon. Though, If you are balding everywhere, then that might mean your AGA is more aggressive, since factors like severity vary from person to person.\n\nIf you think your case is on the severe side, maybe consider going straight to dutasteride.",

            "thank you! i went to Heva Clinic in istanbul. i never took minoxidil or finasteride for the transplant. i just got it done and let the hair do it\u2019s thing.\n\nAnd to those who are going to fin-splain me on the importance of fin: I am fully knowledgble about Fin, Min, DHT, all of that. It was my conscious choice to get a HT and not go on medication that i'm uncomfortable with, and keep track of any further hair loss if I do need to cross that bridge someday.",
            "Kinky/afro hair has a lot of volume so hair looks dense even without many follicles, plus the kinkiness makes the hairline look more natural, i.e. you don't end up with the unnaturally straight hairline you often see with transplants on people with straight hair.",
            "X",
            "Yep, 3, 500 grafts gone already. Less than 2K left when the rest goes.....will it be enough? It is irrational to negate meds, unless one experiences overwhelming complications. There are a number of different routes, topicals, etc that may assist with complications......",

            "So a FYI for others......the visual and physical density loss will not be apparent until your remaining natural hair reaches an approx 50% loss ratio. Due to this, then hitting the meds may have minimal effect, stabilising what is left, maybe? As at this point, the androgen steamroller has been left up and running for some time and has momentum that one will be attempting to stop.....best of luck.....",
            "Totally agree with you! And in reality, causes me distress how others entertain ignorance at the expense of verified (volumes of) evidence, that is now common knowledge......As great as this guys results appear it does look like from (initial before photo) he's off to a NW5/6.....try reeling that in with meds once aware, and/or getting HT'd to fill in.......",
            "Bro went from sexual harassment to stealing your girl",
            "Just incase the doctor who did your procedure didn't elucidate this to you, androgenic alopecia will likely continue to wreak havoc on the rest of your scalp hairs (provided you have aga).\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe results of your HT are really impressive, your hair looks amazing. It'd just be a damn shame if you end up with continued miniaturisation of the rest of your scalp hair by not being on a 5ar inhibitor.",
            "Thanks. I\u2019ve been finding doing the minoxidil and finasteride routine for life to be a big pain. I\u2019ve been thinking about just getting a transplant and seeing what happens I only have frontal loss.",
            "Get on fin asap homie",
            "I am in the same boat my man and it\u2019s refreshing to see this comment didn\u2019t get downvoted.",
            "Fin-splain? Lmao bro it\u2019s literally a scientific fact that you will relapse without them. Why not try them and then cross the side-effect bridge if you need to some day",
            "I totally get it man\n\nI put off taking fin for almost a year. Flew around the country saw hair transplant docs, contacted a dozen compounding pharmacies, looked into topicals, researched the risks of NAFLD and impotence etc etc\n\nMinoxidil was even worse for me. I was terrified to take that shit\n\nEventually just said fuck it and started using Xyons topical hair loss formula which is absolutely insane at 2.5% \n\nI still keep super low dose minoxidil usage at 2% because again I'm cautious \n\nI haven't noticed anything. Been on it 4 months now.",
            "You obviously know this from what you have noted in your comments (?) So a FYI for others......the visual and physical density loss will not be apparent until your remaining natural hair reaches an approx 50% loss ratio. So you will have lost half of you native hair density before you actually realise it.  Due to this, then hitting the meds may have minimal effect, stabilising what is left, maybe? As at this point, the androgen steamroller has been left up and running for some time and has momentum that one will be ***attempting*** to stop.....best of luck.....",
            "because women are either sexually harassed or stolen",
            "I second this.  You don't want the rest of your natural hairs to be impacted by androgen activated hairloss.  It's worth at the least taking Finasteride.",
            "The doctor does mention it, she personally told me I\u2019ll probably need another HT in the future",
            "If you don't take fin/dut then you will continue to lose hair while your transplant hairs remain. It will look pretty funk at some point.",
            "You're providing an informed rational example of how to proceed, top stuff! Somehow though, downvoters from the 1300's have managed to infiltrate all these posts.......",
            "Not at all, some people the sides are simply not worth it, for example I have a minor heart condition, taking Fin has a high chance to exacerbate the issue. Not worth it. Could be similar for others",
            "I think Min is not advised for people with any heart conditions.",
            "Didnt a study came out a couple of months ago proving the exact opposite thing",

Didn't want to give me oral min either cause it could cause lower blood pressure and it would be \"merely\" for cosmetic purposes which he didn't think had a higher priority over safety.

I\u2019ve seen people here get few results until the 2 year mark and their progress began to rapidly advance, so definitely continue treatment! From seeing results on this sub and also from me personally experience I would reallly recommend you give microneedling a go.
