            "Honestly, I'm stumped. It seems like a bug, but this is a replacement effect with a triggered ability and an ability causing damage to be dealt from multiple sources - it's a complex scenario and it may very well be that this is the correct outcome. I consider myself to have a decent grasp of the rules, but this is weird.\n\nI would ask the /r/mtgrules sub if you don't get an answer here.",
            "It's just bugged.  The wording on Vindicator is the exact same as the wording on a shield counter, and one shield counter prevents simultaneous damage from multiple sources with one application.  The Vindicator replacement should apply one time, prevent 11 damage, and create one 11-damage trigger.\n\n122.1c ... \u201cIf damage would be dealt to this permanent, prevent that damage and remove a shield counter from it.\u201d",

            "Yeah I can't see any reason why it would trigger that way and I'm combing the rules. Each 1 damage dealt by case of the gateway express is an independent damage source, dealt by that creature, not case of the gateway express. Ie it will benefit from their lifelink/deathtouch/etc, remove a single shield counter, etc. But its also dealt simultaneously, which has some open ended questions about how it would interact with potential mechanics (if something said 'the first time a creature deals damage each turn...' or something like that). But for vindicator it should simply see 11 different instances of 1 damage each, prevent each of them, then put 11 triggers of 1 damage each to 11 targets. So I don't get it",
            "I definitely wouldn't have expected it to trigger the full damage that many times, so it feels like a bug to me, but it could just be a very counter intuitive ruling I guess \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nAlso, I'm not sure why you targeted it, because if it worked as I would expect, they would be able to ping your creatures to death and Vindicator would still survive because the damage would be prevented anyway.\n\nAnd thirdly I'm now wondering if there's any way to use Vindicator and the Case against the opponent to trigger lots of unexpected damage, but Case only targets a creature you don't control, so I'm guessing maybe not unfortunately...",

Keep in mind that commons and uncommons are basically free in the long run.\n\nHaving said all this, Jump In can be fun, so it's a good way to have fun and win cards, and it's a lot less risky than drafting (which if you are good at it's a lot better value).",

            "Pretty obvious that opponent thought they could exile your creatures but were forced to exile emrakul. Funny nonetheless",

            "I think the only play opponent can make there to not lose on the extra turn is shock in the land, dash ragavan, jolt awake nothing to gain 2 energy, attack with ragavan and pay to buff it, block with emrakul and pass.\n\nThen the extra turn starts with the two creatures on board, 2 energy, Ragavan in graveyard so it can't be dashed, and the only spells in hand are the prison and the second jolted awake (not counting the DRC because that's hindsight).\n\nThat leaves OP playing with slightly less options and I think max 4 damage on board so not lethal. Opponent 90% loses next turn, but maybe they have a play.",

            "Again, class. \ud83e\udd23\n\nReading the card explains the card.  \n\n\nThough really, I think some players just aren't mentally prepared for how to play poorly as their own opponent, like trying to play yourself at Chess. Don't give your enemy resources for later, make them attack into your bigger creatures, Tap and waste all their stuff as much as you can. Self sabotage.\n\n**Don't cast things that only afflict target opponent.**",

            "I think they might have been able to swing the pumper into Emrakul and cast Jolted Awake twice without bringing anything back. That would mean only 3 damage would be possible the next turn, at least getting the Emrakul player another turn.",

            "1. Attack with Guide into Emrakul.\n2. Static Prison emrakul\n3. Spend all energy on jolted awake bringing something irrelevant.\n\nThey would start their turn with only Lunarch on field and no energy, so emrakul would return.",
            "This what I've always said: this Emrakul is just not a good card because controlling your opponent is a deceptively weak effect. It sounds badass, but any card I put into my deck is gonna be beneficial for ME, so most plays you can make are still gonna benefit me in the end. Often the best play is to just do nothing and pass the turn back, in which case you just gave your opponent an extra draw for no reason. It's just a glorified 13/13 French vanilla in 80%+ of the cases.\n\nI've always laughed when my opponent plays it against me, and I honestly think almost every time my opponent played it, it has actively improved my chance of winning.",

            "\\[\\[Emrakul, the Promised End\\]\\] lets you play your opponent next turn for them, but they get an extra turn after that.  While the opponent had very limited options for sabotaging the player, the plays they made were far from optimal, making a win on the extra turn inevitable.",
