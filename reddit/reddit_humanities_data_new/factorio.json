            "Asked this in the last thread and got no response.\n\nI'm using Space Exploration and LTN, with the mod to allow space elevator LTN deliveries. Every now and then I get a 'train out of fuel' warning which lasts only a second or two. It disappears before I can click it and find out where the train is, and I can never see any stopped trains in the network. All my depots refuel trains with nuclear fuel and the network isn't very large - they should never run out of fuel in normal circumstances.\n\nWhat's causing these alerts?",
            "I\u2019m not exactly sure how to word this question, but it\u2019s something I\u2019ve wondered about with Factorio but also other games like Transport Fever 2, Big Pharma, Kerbal Space Program, etc. I really love games about engineering and system-building, but I feel like I\u2019m lacking in some kind of basic mindset or skills that make people good at these games.\n\nIt\u2019s exciting and fun in the early game, but I often hit a wall as things get more complex. Tutorials tend to ruin the fun, but without them it feels like trying to play a really complicated board game without the rule book.\n\nI guess I\u2019m wondering if I should take a basic class in engineering or problem solving or something, just to develop the brain skills that make these games \u201cclick\u201d for others. Are many players here engineers or have STEM backgrounds? Did you enjoy math in school and end up taking advanced stuff like calculus? What about coding? Any other things you have learned or done that gave you skills that translate to Factorio?\n\nTL;DR - Have you found that any math or engineering classes you\u2019ve taken irl helped you in Factorio? Would you recommend anything like that for someone who loves the game but struggles with the figuring out the more complex parts?",

            "This is my own personal experience but I don't think those classes helped per-se. I think whatever it is in my head that enjoyed those classes is also what enjoys Factorio. That said, the way to not get overwhelmed I've found is to break stuff down into easily digestable sections which is similar to using functions or methods in programming so familiarity with one definitely helps with the other. \n\nFor example, when designing yellow science (a rather complicated recipe once you start trying to think about all the intermediates) instead of trying to figure out how to do all of it all at once you break it down into discrete chunks (in programming terms this would be a function) that can be thought about independently. That way, when looking at the bigger picture of how to make processing units you don't need to worry about the red circuit details other than knowing which belt and lane red circuits will be available on. \n\nAnother way to think of this is like how you'd create an outline for a paper before actually sitting down and writing the details. You don't need to know the contents of every paragraph when making your thesis or conclusion, you just need to know the structure and the overall intent of each section. This analogy breaks down somewhat more quickly than the programming one but it comes from a similar place of composability and modularity, where the contents of each paragraph serve to support their section and the sections support the overall work.",
            "I wouldn't be so scared of looking up how other people do x, y, or z. \"Self-taught\" doesn't mean \"learning without any teachers,\" it means \"learning to find teachers.\" Engineers, programmers and autodidacts don't learn in a vacuum.",
            "Engineering clearly helps, but I feel like the main way to get over the wall is something more general - learning how to break a huge problem into large problems and large problems into small problems.\n\nSome like using a notepad, and others just hold it in their head.\n\nYou know how to solve small problems. Try to work out how to break the big problems into small ones.\n\nIf you're stressed from the locals, just disable them or set them to peaceful.\n\nFor example, the game at the start tells you \"launch a rocket to win\". What the hell is that? So you look and see it's a tech that needs 5 science packs. You don't have those so lets start by making the red science pack. For that you need? A gear and a copper plate. How do I make a gear? From an iron plate. How do I make the plates? From ores in a furnace. How do I get ores? With a miner.\n\nEach one of these problems is easy, but the big picture is large.",
            "The most important problem solving skill is breaking problems into smaller pieces. Don't try to build a whole base from scratch. Break up the base into pieces: mining, smelting, production, bus, science, mall, etc. Solve the problem of making the individual pieces and then put them together. \n\nA lot of players have math heavy backgrounds like engineering, coding, and science because problem solving is cultivated in these fields. There is no one class that is specifically there to teach you problem solving, but introductory physics and proof based math classes require it most.",
            "> for someone who loves the game but struggles with the figuring out the more complex parts?\n\nThat's the trick, there are no complex parts.\n\nThe thing that people find the most complex is circuit logic and trains.  But both of those are optional and the \"minimum viable product\" is pretty simple.\n\nMy first few times through the game the entire extent of my circuit logic was running a wire from the heavy (and light) oil tank to a pump heading off to cracking.  That's it.  A wire and a simple comparison to enable a pump.  I didn't really start messing with circuit logic until I started messing with the LTN mod.  There's some crazy stuff you can do, but for the most part it's a solution in search of a problem, unless there are specific mod demands that make it a requirement.\n\nTrains are also not terribly complicated to be functional, just a train with an engine pointed in both directions doing a simple back and forth to pick up materials from a remote mine and drop it off at your base.  And the tutorial is pretty good, more than up to the task of teaching you how to do that even of those individual lines cross each other.\n\nEven more complicated networks aren't even that difficult once you get the hang of signaling.  *Getting* the hang of signaling can be tricky, but once you get it you get it, it's less a learning curve and more a single big step.  The hardest part about designing a big rail network is just getting everything lined up and looking nice.  A functional system is pretty quick, a rotationally symmetrical chunk aligned system is less so... but also not necessary, just nice to have.\n\nThe rest?  Every individual part is simple, the trickiest part is linking them together. And the important thing to remember about that is... you can tear stuff down and movie it if it's in the way.\n\nThere's a few patterns that you'll learn that will help alleviate your mental load when laying out a factory, but you'll pick those up by dong, like how to set up stone/steel furnace smelting stacks.",
            "Not remotely, because there is no way to make logistic bots work with personal roboports, which is what spidertrons use.\n\nBest you can do is be physically present with the spidertron so you can manually transfer artillery shells from the spidertron to your inventory, then from your inventory to the artillery blueprint.\n\nThe game kind-of discourages this since artillery shells only stack inside artillery turrets and artillery wagons. Their stack size is only 1 item in a spidertron or in your inventory. The game seems to encourage having the spidertron build _rails_, and then have trains bring in the ammo.",
            "Unfortunately not easily in vanilla.\n\nThe normal way for spiders to drop items is to have logistic bots on a network. You can build the roboport, artillery, and other things, but you can't put the robots inside the roboport.\n\nHowever, if you use an externally edited blueprint, you can make the artillery request shells as it's built, and then the construction bots will build the artillery and fill it with ammo. There are sites that work fine for this.\n\nHere is a BP for an artillery with 10 shells:\n\n>!0eNqVkNFqwzAMRf/lPnsj8Rqa+W3fMcZIWtEIHCfYytYQ/O+zHQql0Ic9Cck6Ohdv6O1Cs2cnMBv4NLkA87kh8MV1Ns9knQkGLDRCwXVj7jovbC359UUW70kQFdid6QpTR/UPPAxk7R2t45cCOWFh2pOUZv12y9iTT+efZ1CYp5DAyWVxOla9NgprqdmQIoT88mg3dRWztmQ0dz+iYLue0gI+bsiu+mUZChvSzg/5UJy6rQ/Hd31s9VvdNDrGP12ldtc=!<\n\nEDIT: reddit doesn't like the site I linked so I had to remove it from here.",
            "Yeah, that would be possible. I'm not sure it's a good idea, since artillery turrets are not that disposable, but it could be done.\n\nA slightly better option I've seen was to use artillery with a car for shoot-and-scoot tactics. Drive somewhere nice, plop down a turret or two pulling shells out of the car, then tear it all down and leave before the biters reach your position.",
            "Not really no.\n\nBut you can just build a spider death army and run them around.  A simple build of a single solar panel, single radar, and single power pole can give you coverage during daylight and show expansions on the map.\n\nThe way artillery is designed is via trains.

            "No circuits: Make your chip block have two outputs: a priority one for science / other stuff, and a low priority for modules.\n\nThe module station only gets supplied from an overflow splitter, or some other way of restricting it so the other side gets filled first.\n\nThen two separate trains, one for normal priority and one for low.",
            "Well, \\*some\\* modules are needed for science.\n\nBut for the ones you just want to use in assemblers/beacons, I personally would just let it run and chew into science resources until it has the amount of modules I want buffered.\n\nOtherwise you could use circuits on your train network and set train limits to your module blocks to 0 if your science production is getting starved.",
            "Setting aside \"just let it happen until you have enough modules buffered\", the way I did it was a circuit network. Have a global-ish circuit network connect your science production to your modules, have your station unloading chips for science production raise a signal if it needs chips, and have your module production enable (or set its train limit to 1, or whatever) if that signal is 0.\n\nIf necessary I can provide the blueprints I'm using for my (modded, but not in a way that affects the circuits) playthrough. It's a more involved version of that, since it has to handle low-priority supply and demand, as well as calculating based on the amount of stuff available.",
            "I used what I called a zone system. My mall was a separate zone starting from mining ore to building circuits to feed modules.

            "Step one is to get the ratios, step two is to consider belt and assembler speed.\n\nStep 1: You get two wires per copper plate, and the recipe takes 0.5 seconds. (Assembler speed makes this slower or faster, but as long as all your assemblers are the same tier then it'll keep the same ratio between them.) A circuit needs three wires and also takes 0.5 seconds, so you need 1.5 wire assemblers per circuit assembler or 3 wire for 2 circuit assemblers.\n\nStep 2: Tier 1 assemblers have a crafting speed of 0.5, so the 3 wire assemblers will use 1 copper per second each, so you can feed 15 of them from one full belt of copper. The ratio in step 1 says this corresponds to 10 circuit assemblers, which use a total of 10 iron per second, 2/3 of a yellow belt.\n\nIf you use T2 assemblers with a crafting speed of 0.75 the numbers become more complicated but the ratio stays the same.",
            "Wire is usually not placed on a belt but directly inserted from assembler to another. You can try [this calculator](https://kirkmcdonald.github.io/) to start with. Mod users go for Factory Planner or Helmod generally. The math especially with modules gets too complicated to do on paper.",
            "Assuming saturated input belts and unconstrained output:\n\n(Item crafting time / factory speed) = crafts per second\n\n(Crafts per second * input materials needed) = input materials needed per second\n\n(Crafts per second * productivity * items per craft) = output items per second\n\nYellow belts move 15 items past a point per second, red moves 30, blue 45. (AFAIK.)\n\nSo if you had one yellow belt of copper plates that could feed 15 plates per second, and your factories had zero productivity modules installed, you could build 30 copper wire per second from it - enough to feed 10 green circuit crafts per second. Since a yellow belt can feed 15 plates per second, you'll be able to feed that side with one yellow belt of iron with 5 per second left over. If you're crafting with gray assemblers that have 0.5 crafting speed, and you're crafting something that takes 0.5 seconds to craft, your crafting speed would be (0.5 / 0.5) = 1 craft per second per assembler, or two wires per second per assembler, assuming fully fed.",

If you're not getting enough crude oil build more pumpjacks, and if you're using all of your oil patches and still not getting enough explore to find more oil. The farther the oil patches are from your spawn the richer they get, i.e. each pumpjack produces more oil.\n\nFor a typical scenario you can have all your pumpjacks merge into a single pipe, but it depends.

They stop consuming power, the patch no longer depletes and they restart as soon as the buffer is emptied.\n\nFluid flows from higher proportional capacity to lower proportional capacity, and the larger the difference the faster the flow. A pipe with 100 flow will fill a pipe with 0 fluid much faster than a pipe with 51 fluid will fill a pipe with 49 fluid. For this reason it's usually fairly difficult or slow to completely fill pipes or storage tanks - as they start nearing 100% capacity there isn't much room for flow anymore. You can circumvent this by using pumps. A pump crams everything from its input entity to its output entity regardless of difference in fluid level. If you want to completely fill and empty your storage tanks consider using pumps at the input and output.\n\nFlow is determined by how much the entity is filled proportionally - a pipe with 50 fluid is at an equilibrium with a storage tank with 12.5k fluid. Both are at 50% so there's no flow.",

In 1.1 you'd probably need between 3 and 8 pipelines per fluid depending on pump placement.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying the current system is better, but IMO it shouldn't be simplified so far that moving large quantities of fluid is completely trivial",

I never reached the point at which fluid handling became unbearable and if i did, i just used trains. So i'd rather have had transportation pipes, similar to the fixed-length pipes from space exploration for long distances. \n\nBut then again, let's see how they balance this (if at all) and if i will actually miss it when there's so much other stuff to manage in 2.0.",

But given how many fewer operations/places there will be it is largely minimized.\n\nIf Factorio had an actual defined \"end\", if it had a limited map size, if it wasn't so obsessively and amazingly crafted and optimized; then the existing fluid system would be FINE.

That is, it wasn't intentionally designed this way, but the behavior was considered acceptable, given that the algorithm is generally easier to comprehend and is probably much simpler in terms of code complexity and computational cost. Trying to alter the algorithm or find a different algorithm to avoid this behavior wasn't considered worth it.\n\n> > As a special case, pumps can pull at a faster rate if they are connected directly to a storage tank.\n>\n> I'm not really sure there should be any special cases - won't this be more confusing than less? Why can this not always be true for pumps?\n\nI just think of it as if the tank provides a special arrangement with the pump, mostly by being elevated, so that the pump's input is always fully saturated as long as the tank has any fluid. Whereas with a half-full pipe, the fluid is just sitting at the bottom and the pump's input is not fully saturated, so it struggles by pumping air with the liquid for example.",

Because of how the fluid system currently works, turbines closer to the reactor empty first, and always take priority over turbines further back.\n\nThis leads to a reduced number of turbines actually able to function, which leads to less water coming back overall, which is identical to the \"running out of water\" case, so your water top-up kicks in and pushes more water into the system. This slowly over-fills the system until you no longer have anywhere for the water to go and your reactor deadlocks.\n\nBasically this problem is sort of always there because you need a bunch of both boilers and turbines, but having a bunch of boilers and turbines is exactly what causes this fluid priority issue.\n\nThis change would completely eliminate this class of problem.",

I welcome this change wholeheartedly.

In other words, if a segment is half full, then the pulling rate is half of the maximum.\n\nMy understanding of this is that you can instantly fill a pipe, but it has a finite volume. Then you can extract fluid from the pipe at a finite rate just based on how full the pipe is. I didn't see anything about multiple machines pulling from the same pipe leading to a lower extraction flow rate, so I guess if there are two output pumps, it sucks at the same rate for each, making it twice as fast.\n\nI guess if you had infinite pumps filling the pipe and infinite pumps extracting from the other end of the pipe, then the middle pipe sections would have infinite flow rate.

I have seen few games/mods where something like \"voltage drop\" exists, is actually calculated by some resistance and current AND the loads respond to changes in voltage other than \"I have less total power available\" and even then its always over simplified. A simple motor or resistive load is going to change behavior based on the source voltage, impacting how much current it draws, which impacts the voltage drop, which....

Given that sinking from a segment is proportional to how full the segment is, that means that it will take a long time for that super long segment to have full throughput. Using pumps to split up the segments into smaller volumes will make it easier to keep full throughput for downstream sinks. \n\nMy only concern is really about how, as described, I can have an unlimited number of water pumps on a pipe and essentially have an unlimited number of sinks down stream. If my reading of the FFF is correct, then I see that as a mistake. Each segment should still have a segment defined max throughput or flow rate based on the pipes being used. Then the throughput for all sinks is that 'segment throughput' times the fullness of the segment. Each component connected to a segment would also have a throughput and it's flow to/from the segment would be limited to the lower of the component or segment throughput. That one adjustment seems like it would greatly improve the fluids update and leave room for things like larger pipes as they would have a higher max throughput.",

If the pipe is 1 meter further down and covers 1/400,000th  of the circumference (we will round this to a neat 100m, but the actual figure would be around 100.088m), the difference in length required would be somewhere around 0.0001 of a meter (e.g. around 0.1mm shorter).

            "Blueprint:  \n[https://paste.ee/p/Se1zi](https://paste.ee/p/Se1zi)\n\nExplanation: With the Fluid rework for 2.0 Sushi Pipes become usable. This build emptys and fills the main base sushi Pipe (Connection to base at bottom) once a second with a new fluid.  \nEach fluid need to be connected to a storage tank farm, with these connections being at the top of this build.  \nThe emptying process is done in 2 stages, to get a greater amount of pumpes working. The first stage is the bottom half, emptying the main base sushi pipe into the 2nd stage at the top where the fluid get sorted to their individual storages. This 2 stage apporoach greatly increases the pipes with access to the main sushi pipe thus empting it faster, and can get away with few pipes for individual fluids, becasue the 2nd stage sushi pipe segment is much smaller thus the pumps can work faster.",

            "which ones?",
            "Legendary quality, or legendary confusion?",
            "if I read the new FFF correctly: there is no more throughput in pipes when 2.0/SA launches. it hurt UPS too much, it was unintuitive, over complicated, didn't make any sense sometimes (why does fluid move faster going on direction than the other? why does the order in which you placed the pipes matter??? that sorta thing), and mot importantly it didn't keep up with the changes 2.0/SA are bringing (such as quality).\n\nso now pipes/segments of pipes act instantaneously instead of the weird fluid dynamics the game tried offering. No more pumps every 8-10x pipes, no more worrying about how one machine is somehow hogging all of the juice, despite there being enough for the others, no more worrying about throughput, etc... It's just going to go from source/tank to immediately what's pulling it, making working with fluids SO much easier.",

            "The whole system? The two stage pipes to let you run more pumps before running fewer pumps on a smaller pipe system... The two sushi pipes are usually the same fluid but deliberately disconnected.",
            "Why not both?",
            "I mean yeah but it would still be weird to have unlimited throughput, it definitely makes things much easier tho, and now that I think about it, it gets rid of a bunch of nuclear lag making it more viable for late stage megabasing",
            "Honestly one of the greatest changes in 2.0 yet",
            "They are disconected, because the speed at which pumps pump is dependent on how much fluid is in the pipe it's pulling from. So many pumps pump from the main sushi pipe which will always be almost empty, creating a high level in the 2nd pipe, which can then be sorted with fewer pumps.",
            "Yeah, exactly. That is cursed."
