Physical damage was I had to wait 12 weeks for spicy time but it was VERY painful for 6ish months. As nerves healed I got painful stabbing pains in both areas (tbh mostly the urethra which took longest to heal fully). I was \u201cback to normal\u201d at a year. I have regained all sensation and am fully operational. Baby was a week late and nearly 10lbs. Don\u2019t reproduce with a family of tall people. Oh and I had another baby a couple years after this incident. He ended up giving me preeclampsia and my husband got a vasectomy. Never. Again.",

For about 3 months I'd complain how much pain I'd have in the left arm after each administration. Seering pain like my arm was on fire and frozen at the same time. It would last for days.\n\nFinally, after many tests.... my Oncology team realizes the mass in my chest was so large it caused the vascular system in the area to be well.... crushed. Everything was getting pressed into the chest wall and with veins being compressed, the drug couldn't flow up my arm as quickly. \n\nPutting it all together... when having an IV chemo administered in my left arm/hand.... the drug would sit too long in my arm before getting through the compresses flow.\n\nTLDR: Chemo drug essentially caused INTERNAL chemical burns in my left arm.

Adding a ton of sugar to the mix obviously didn't help though lol. \n\nWhat I learned from my surgeon was that tea and coffee contain high levels of oxalates, regardless of the type, and the only thing that really prevents stones from forming is adequate water intake and citric acid, as the acidity of lemon/lime juice helps dissolve the buildup of calcium.

            "I lived in Vegas for 6 years, all my jobs except for the last were in casinos, I've seen some shit. The tamest is at my first job we didn't work directly for the hotel (just leased space there) so we could cash our paychecks at the cage. One payday, one of my coworkers cashes his check on a break, hits the tables on his way back, comes back 20 minutes later having lost it all. And this wasn't minimum wage either, it was a tattoo shop and he was an artist, so we're talking a check for thousands of dollars. He just laughed, and at least waiting a couple weeks to do it again. \n\nSecond job not gambling related, but I worked at a nightclub in one of the casinos, some girl in line to *get in the club* was already drunk off her ass and popped a squat and pissed and shit right there in line. Like, full on diarrhea all over.\n\nThird job was for a casino downtown. I would start my day walking the property, including the casino floor, and end it that way as well. I'd frequently see the same people on both walks, sometimes days in a row, and each time they looked worse and worse. It was awful.\n\nEdit: this was secondhand but it comes from my last non-casino job - driving for Uber/Lyft. Picked up friendly older guy, don't remember where I took him but I think he was local.

            "I have several stories. I worked as a cashier and also a slot attendant for 5 years.\n\nThe worst was when a guy was just sitting at a slot machine with a bewildered look on his face. Like he was in shock. I asked him if he was ok, could I get him a water? He just looked at me and said, \"I need help, man. This just isn't fun anymore.\" \n\nI called my manager on the radio and asked him to grab a casino host, then sat down with him. A casino host couldn't help, but he could take him to a quiet area to talk. My manager came by, I introduced the player and said, \"Guy_name is having a hard time right now. Think we can all go somewhere quiet and talk?\" The manager took it from there, but I felt so bad for him. He was just quietly crying in desperation and whatever realization he had just experienced. \n\n\nAs a cashier, my first Christmas Eve there was the first time I'd ever worked on Christmas Eve in my 28 years. It was also the first Christmas I hadn't been with my family.  Around 8 or 9pm, a lady came to my cashier window and asked for $250 in quarter tokens (several years before paper tickets). I did the thing and she said, \"No, no, no baby! You've got to put some extra luck on these! I need to win, I haven't bought my babies anything for Christmas yet.\" I tapped them twice, wiggled my fingers towards the quarters and squinched my eyes, and said, \"Done! That was all the luck I brought tonight!\" Ol girl was tickled pink, she just knew she was gonna get that jackpot for her babies! \n\nAnother cashier sat with me at dinner break and told me it only gets easier after that. She lied. \n\nLast one for now was the lady who had just won a $5000 or $10,000 jackpot on a dime machine. It was very clear she didn't want it. Turned out she was banned for her gambling addiction and behavior. She was begging to just forget we saw her and give it to anyone else. She just wanted to play. Unfortunately, the law is the law and she was handcuffed by gaming officials and arrested.\n\nWhite: Just thought of another good one. It was an employee this time. She got caught stealing tips players have to the slot attendant. \n\nThe cool thing about casinos is when they catch you, they make note of it, save the video evidence, and do nothing other than add to a report. Once the employee steals enough, I think $500, it's a state felony because technically every non-player penny inside a casino is state property because it's state regulated. Like a bank is federal.\n\nSo they catch a co-worker stealing tips. One day she's just coming on shift and is counting into her jackpot payout bank when gaming stops by and starts talking to her. Gaming guys aren't friendly if they have to leave their office. They're like extra angry chihuahua's that haven't eaten for days and suddenly are being teased with hot dogs, small children's fingers, and pupperonis. Everyone in uniform stops and backs up, then they start loudly reading her her rights. Not only was she arrested, but she got called out in front of everyone she was stealing from.",

The buy-in range was from $100-300 min/max at our room, so by poker standards not terribly high. After she hit the jackpot she started playing the bigger games, first 2-5 no limit ($200-1000 buy-in) and then moving up to 5-10 no limit ($500 min, and I believe at the time it was no max). Next thing you knew she was out playing in the high stakes blackjack pit playing $100 a hand. She got bumped up to a black card quickly from all the blackjack she was playing.\n\nFast forward about 4-6 weeks, maybe 2 months tops and we don\u2019t see her around as much.

He was an older guy (late 50's-early 60's) but still pretty healthy, had a lot of money, drove a nice car had a nice house, even owned a small plane that he flew recreationally. Slowly but surely he was coming in more and more frequently though. He started gaining more weight, he was looking more pale and sickly, drank almost constantly. It turned out that his home situation was going downhill fast. He and my friend (his son) had a massive falling out, and eventually his wife left him and took their other daughter with her. He had nothing left but his money and himself, and even that didn't last. He was never winning anything and had to have lost millions in that time frame. He was in the building for days at a time without moving from his machine. Because of that and the amount of alcohol he was consuming combined with the lack of sleep, aging body, and constant second hand smoke exposure, his health was quickly plummeting. He was always nice and happy to talk to anyone, but even that didn't last as he started snapping at every little thing and not interacting with anyone at all.\n\nI left that job years ago but every now and then my family will go back to that same casino and see him at his same machine looking like a husk of his former self.

He was making big bets and pushing to keep his bets working even without a point being on. It was sickening to watch him lose so much so quickly. I was up doing simple bets and I paid close attention to his bets to learn what not todo.\n\nA few days later at another casino I watched someone blow through $20,000 in under 30 minutes.

You could tell he didn't have family or he just didn't communicate with them anymore. I don't know much about truckers or etiquette, but I do not try to judge, but just going by the way he left the room and the smell, he didn't care much about hygiene. Anyways, he hit on a slot machine one night for over $10,000. He stayed for 2 nights and probably played back almost half of it back into the casino in bets and drinks. \n\nHe came back the next week and hit one of those progressive machines with a jackpot of $68,000.

            "It's not really sad by the time you see it. The sad thing is the first time you spend time in a Casino, which for a lot of people is the first day.  \nThe first thing that strikes you is the smell. It's like a sandwich, the ingredients hit you one after another. First there's cigarette smoke. Even in casinos that have banned smoking, the smell still hangs on. Then there's the smell of stale liquor, cheap liquor. The place smells like a wino. Right under that is the smell of unwashed humanity. Sweat, piss, fart, shart, halitosis, and that unmistakeable old person smell. Then you realize these smells are wafting equally from the casino and the clientele.  \nThen there's the sound, or lack of sound. Despite all these people gathered here for 'entertainment', there is no cheering, no laughter, just the maddening noise of game machines all shouting over each other. The players stare zombielike into the screens, the security look out silently over the players, people mill about among the machines in silence. It feels like a cubicle farm.  \nThen there's the sights. Casinos are dressed up like resorts and theme parks mixed together, but have none of the excitement or people either have. You don't see happy families or college kids on skip years or swedish travelers. You see ragged, worn out people in their pajamas shuffling in to disappear into the machines. Contrasting the bright colors and blinking lights and patterned carpet and very nice uniforms. All this will change your impression of a casino really quick, on your first or second day, before you even see something really terrible.  \n   \nThis place is just selling vice, catering to the beaten down people who indulge in it. It's all just part of the delivery mechanism where they take money and give the products, alcohol and gambling. These people are here to feed, not to play. If they win all they win is a chance to get a little more. You come, you buy your loss, you buy your liquor, you go home, you come back tomorrow. It's so mind crushingly mechanically miserable that when you see the misery manifest it only confirms what you had already worked out.",
            "I was at the casino one night and a guy was on a decent tear. I saw him hit a bunch of jackpots in the $1200 - $3000 range. I would say at one point he was up about $7000. He was tipping the floor people who handed him the money like $100 here, $200 there for each jackpot he won. I went there with $1000 to play with, and at $2 a spin I was there for like 5 or 6 hours. I watched this guy just absolutely tank. He went from machine to machine putting in hundreds and hundreds into each machine. He was not some high roller, just a normal dude. Just as I was finishing up, with about $750 to take home with me, one of the floor workers went up to him and this was the conversation. \n\n\"So I see you're having a run of bad luck right now. I would really hate it if you went home with less money in your pocket than what you gave out to us.\" He said something like \"Oh. Ill get it back don't worry.\" Within 10 minutes he was at the ATM taking out another $1000. Then again at the ATM taking out another $1000. Then again about 10 minutes later taking out another $1000. \n\nDude left about the same time I did, having given out around $1000 - $1500 to floor workers as tips, losing his initial money he came with and at least another $3000 on top of that. I walked to my car a few minutes after him and he was smashing the steering wheel of his truck and screaming.",

So I walk in and could see from across the way it\u2019s in a car, windows cracked (it wasn\u2019t a hot day otherwise I would\u2019ve done something asap). I think maybe someone is just running in and coming back. Hopefully, right? I went in, played some craps, come back out later to get in the ride to the airport, and yeah I can still hear that dog out there barking. I told someone who was valet or concierge or something but I wasn\u2019t convinced they would actually do anything.\n\nReality is like some gambling addict is so consumed by their addiction they just leave their dog in the car while they piss money away. That poor dog is stuck in the damn car crying out for its owner or for help.

You can ask your job for an advance, you could take out credit cards and lines of credit, you could take out loans against whatever valuables you may own (car, house, etc.), you could pawn any lower-value valuables you have, you could apply for payday loans, so on and so forth.\n\nThere's lots of ways to generate short term cash beyond your means.

The second group was significantly less likely to go for the wager than the first group, despite the actions being fundamentally the same, because their brains now saw that $5 as \"theirs\" and some of them didn't want to lose it, even for the chance to double their earnings.\n\nThose with gambling addiction literally have different brain structures than most people, and their aversion to loss and failure is much weaker and/or the dopamine rush they get from winning is much stronger than what you find in a typical brain.",

The first step is to put up visual/access barriers right away. (Things like mobile panels/walls, Pardon our construction, this area is closed, or even just something with a printed theme, etc) that are on hand for just this sort of thing.  Preposition uniquely themed construction materials that they also have on hand such as carpet tiles, furniture, and the like.  They will almost always have a company on retainer with discrete vehicles and neutral uniforms to actually carry out the work, that is a subcontractor under an LLC so they are not liable if anything goes wrong.  Remove the contaminated materials, remediate the hazards, bring in the construction contractors or general maintenance once the hazards are gone, sign off on repairs, and remove the barriers.

My (28F) fianc\u00e9 (30M) and I are getting married in three months. We've been meticulously planning this wedding for over a year, dreaming of a perfect day filled with love, joy, and elegance. But my sister-in-law, \"Anna\" (25F), is throwing a massive wrench into our plans.\n\nAnna has a tiny dog, \"Buddy,\" that she treats like her actual child. She's one of those people who can't go anywhere without her dog. A couple of weeks ago, she asked if she could bring Buddy to our wedding. Now, our venue has a strict no-pets policy, and frankly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to have a dog at a formal event like this. So, I told her, as politely as I could, that we prefer no pets at the wedding.\n\nYou would think I had just banned her from attending the wedding herself! Anna lost it. She went on a tirade about how Buddy is the most well-behaved dog in the world, how he wouldn't cause any trouble, and how she feels \"naked\" without him. She even pulled the \"he's like family to me\" card. I stood my ground, explaining that it\u2019s our day, our rules, and we want it to be perfect.\n\nSince then, Anna has been waging a passive-aggressive war against me. She\u2019s been posting cryptic messages on social media about how \"some people\" don\u2019t understand the bond between a pet and their owner. She\u2019s hinted that if Buddy isn\u2019t welcome, she might not come at all. This is stressing me out beyond belief. My fianc\u00e9 is trying to mediate, but he's caught in the crossfire. He supports my decision but is also worried about family harmony.\n\nOur parents and friends are divided. Some think I\u2019m being a bridezilla and should make an exception for \"family.\" Others agree that a no-pets policy is reasonable, especially for such a significant event.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole for refusing to let my sister-in-law bring her dog to our wedding?

My (28F) fianc\u00e9 (30M) and I are getting married in three months, and we\u2019ve decided to have a dog-themed wedding. We are huge dog lovers and have always dreamt of a wedding where our furry friends could be part of our big day. Our two golden retrievers will be the \"best dogs,\" and we've invited all our friends and family to bring their dogs too. We\u2019ve planned a beautiful outdoor ceremony with dog-friendly activities and treats.\n\nEnter my sister-in-law, \"Anna\" (25F), who has a cat named \"Whiskers.\" Anna asked if she could bring Whiskers to our wedding. Now, anyone who knows anything about cats and dogs can see where this is going. Our venue is all set up for dogs, and introducing a cat into the mix is a recipe for disaster. I told her, as politely as I could, that we prefer no cats at the wedding for the safety and comfort of everyone involved.\n\nYou would think I had just banned her from attending the wedding herself! Anna lost it. She went on a tirade about how Whiskers is the most well-behaved cat in the world, how he wouldn\u2019t cause any trouble, and how she feels \"naked\" without him. She even pulled the \"he's like family to me\" card. I stood my ground, explaining that it\u2019s our day, our rules, and we want it to be perfect for our dog guests.\n\nSince then, Anna has been waging a passive-aggressive war against me. She\u2019s been posting cryptic messages on social media about how \"some people\" don\u2019t understand the bond between a pet and their owner. She\u2019s hinted that if Whiskers isn\u2019t welcome, she might not come at all. This is stressing me out beyond belief. My fianc\u00e9 is trying to mediate, but he's caught in the crossfire. He supports my decision but is also worried about family harmony.\n\nOur parents and friends are divided. Some think I\u2019m being unreasonable and should make an exception for \"family.\" Others agree that a no-cats policy is more than reasonable, especially for such a significant event.",
            "Definitely! Or when they change it to something really hard to follow like initials like \u201cA\u201d or \u201cI\u201d and I just want to say that they could have named them anything and it wouldn\u2019t matter to the audience!",
            "Doh! And I wanted to write stranger, but I saw your name, so was conflicted, lol.",

            "Hello. I'm Anna. And I love cats (every kind of cat) and my cats go where I go dammit. If you don't want my cat you don't want me and that just breaks my heart. \ud83d\ude1c"

I\u2019m a career corporate middle manager person. \n\nI can speak to the first two elements - balancing your personal and professional life. It\u2019s simple, but hard: ***unless you\u2019re contracted otherwise, do your 8 hours per day and no more***. It is hard to implement this because of the cacophony of \u201cI\u2019ll do that at the weekend\u201d / \u201cI was working late again last night\u201d rubbish you hear from deranged co-workers. \n\nI have nearly 30 years of working in different industries. Two things have been constant:\n- I have never known a boss or HR ghoul brave enough to try and write someone up for \u201csticking to contracted hours\u201d or a version thereof (even though I guarantee an HR ghoul somewhere is ***itching*** to have that one in their eerie, bloodstained scrapbook). \n- Every single boss I\u2019ve had - regardless if they\u2019re good/evil, kind/cruel - would ***never, ever*** stop one of their team working extra hours for free - they will never, ever, ***EVER*** try and stop you, even if they know it\u2019s impacting your health. It\u2019s just sensible business, sadly.  Even the kindest boss in the world will ***always*** accept free labour for the company regardless of the impact on the headcount. (That\u2019s you, BTW - headcount - not your real name, not u/relevant_name4050, but a cost line on a spreadsheet. Always remember that and use it as strength)\n\nThe points above are something I constantly come back to when I need to remind myself of how to protect myself. \n\nRegard exercise, I have a young family, so I get up early and exercise before they\u2019re awake. It\u2019s the only way I\u2019ve found that works. \n\nAll the very best from Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",

Do sets in the morning or any time throughout the day when you have a few minutes to spare. Do as many as you can, then the next day try to do one more, and one more the day after that.

I told myself on my 37th Birthday that this was going to be the year where I start taking my healthy more seriously.\n\nI convinced one of my college buddies who lives across the country to do a remote sprint triathlon with me in Arizona.\n\nWe had 6 months to prepare and it was just the goal/accountability that I needed!!!\n\nI told my wife the plan, I did my research for couch potato training for a Triathlon and planned my workouts to happen during my lunch break \u2014 I also WFH full time \u2014 while my kids were as school and my wife was working. This limited the impact of my workouts to my family time. The mixture of small swim/bike/run 10-minute bi-weekly work outs gradually got longer and more frequent as the race approached and wasn\u2019t too rigorous. I love swimming and cycling so they were more fun than running.\n\nAs for social time, my kids are young and in multiple sports/activities so most of the adult friends we have are parents of their teammates/classmates.\n\nWe also plan an annual long weekend with our college friends group who live all over the Midwest so we can maintain those relationships.\n\nAs for work, that\u2019s the big bugaboo. I\u2019ve had a few remote roles since Covid and I\u2019ve been explicitly clear during the interview process that \u201cI am very involved in my kids lives and that family time is my priority. I end my day at 5pm.\u201d I\u2019ve been really lucky to have managers/leaders that understand and respect my personal boundaries around that. It also requires me to not mess around at work and perform my duties as best as possible. If you don\u2019t give them a reason to question your dedication to your job during your working hours they really shouldn\u2019t be questioning that you only work until 5pm. I block out my calendars for family time a 5pm - 8am for family time. I leave my work app notifications on until 6pm in the case my west coast teammates have a question. So far, it\u2019s worked out pretty well. \n\nI also make sure to block out my lunch hour on my calendar to make sure meetings don\u2019t get booked over my exercise time slots.\n\nI hope this helps!",

            "Fitness for me is more about a lifestyle change. While I am happy to be able to get a good resistance session in 2-3 days a week, I am also mindful of how I live between those. If I can walk to a place, I do that. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Don't worry about finding the closest parking spot at the Plaza.\n\n\nIn regards to having this lifestyle, while being a partner, father, and full-time employee... It's about boundaries and support. I have a wonderful partner who supports me in staying active. I have blocked time off during the week, a couple hours on a couple days, so I can get my kid to school and then head to the gym. And, as a family, we go to the local YMCA where they have a child watch program if I want to get some heavy lifting in then we can all head to the pool for a family swim session.\n\n\nHard part is the sleep and diet. I'm not single and in my 20s any more so I end up with some funky sleep schedules if the kid is sick or something. I also end up eating toddler-friendly food a lot.",

            "The best advice is that golf is the most frustrating thing you will ever do. Honestly, your life will be better if you never play. Once you have everything, a round will cost you, on average, at least $60. That\u2019s just the fees for the course and balls, not including drinks. If you play a nice course and drink and stuff, it gets into the hundreds real quick. And it takes so long to learn. It\u2019s intimidating. You\u2019re playing against your own mind most of the time. It takes forever to get good, and when you do, you just realize that you have so much further to go. You hate yourself after every round and question, \u201cWhy do I even do this?\u201d\n\nBut then you stripe a 7-iron 148 yards and it drops 3 inches away from the hole. And it feels like lightning in your veins. You walk up to the green, putter in hand, trash-talking to all your buddies. That\u2019s the magic of golf. You watch the NFL, and no ordinary person can go onto a field and throw a 60-yard pass into triple coverage. You can\u2019t body-check an NHL wingman. You\u2019re not sprinting down the court, dribbling between your legs and hitting Steph Curry threes. But once in a while, on the course, you can hit a Phil Mickelson flop shot that dunks right into the hole. At any given moment, you can, albeit accidentally, replicate anything done by these PGA guys you see on TV. And it makes you love the game. It makes you feel invincible. And that high will keep you coming back for life. At any given moment, you get to feel like one of them.\n\nGolf is not cheap. But it really depends on how much money you are willing to put up front. Honestly, I\u2019ve taught some people golf recently and we just buy a putter first and only putt on practice greens at courses or driving ranges. Then I\u2019d get a used 8-iron, one club, and go to a $15 group lesson. Then practice for three weeks with those two clubs and pay for an hour lesson with a pro using only the two clubs. Then go to the range 5-8 times and only do what you\u2019ve learned in the lessons. Then I\u2019d get two used wedges, like a pitching wedge and a 56\u00b0, preferably with a similar grip to your 8-iron. Take another lesson. Practice more at the range. And now you get a 6-iron and a 3-wood. Same thing. Don\u2019t play a round of golf for your first three months.",

Also there's a hill between my home and work so it's uphill both ways (for the first half), but also downhill both ways for the second half I guess.\n\nI actually got pretty good at it after a while and the biking commute wasn't actually that much more than the driving commute (once you learn to time the lights you can really cut down on the time it takes).

Never really picked it up again, and while I've done a bit of exercising here and there, I haven't picked up a routine.\n\nThe weather's nice again now though, so I guess in my late 30s, I get to do that same process over again!

He not only met my entire family for the first time but charmed them. I swear they like him better than me. We\u2019ve been together 11 years.",
            "We had met through his brother, who I\u2019d met on a yahoo chat room. We\u2019d im\u2019d at first, then via email and phone for weeks, so we had an easy rapport. We planned to meet in October, once he got settled at college and I had more time, since I was finishing high school and had three jobs. He moved into his dorm the day before and had a million things to do, and it was a big risk for him-we lived 5 hours apart, he\u2019d never even visited my state before, and he was very shy in person. That morning, he went to the campus store to buy a phone card to call me, and just decided he couldn\u2019t wait anymore. He sent me an IM and an email that he was coming, he knew I was off that night, and asked me to meet him at my house. It was so spontaneous and *so* not like him. I loved it!!!\u00a0\n\n\nHe had Mapquest directions and printed directions everywhere- from his dorm to my house, then from my house to the mall, and he wouldn\u2019t let me look at any others. We just instantly got each other- I\u2019d never felt so compatible with someone.\u00a0\n\nWhen we went to dinner, I remembered he\u2019d said he liked to call ahead and order at restaurants so he didn\u2019t have to order in person, because it made him anxious. I asked him what he was thinking of getting, and when the waiter came to get our drink order, I ordered drinks and dinner for both of us at the same time. He looked so surprised, relieved, and then happy! We held hands throughout dinner, and when my dinner came, I moved to his side of the booth so we could be as close as possible.\n\n\nAfter dinner, I figured he\u2019d just take me home since he had a 5-hour drive that night-he had a school meeting at 6am. Instead, he\u2019d printed directions from the restaurant to my favorite park, one I\u2019d talked about on the phone because I love the rose garden. He walked me around the garden, the swan pond, and pushed me on swings. He got this funny look on his face and told me to wait. He ran back to the car and got a rose bouquet out of his trunk that he\u2019d forgotten to give me when he picked me up.\u00a0\n\n\nWe\u2019d just looked at all of these beautiful roses, and this bouquet he looked embarrassed to hand had been in the trunk all day, in the summer. They were so wilted that the stems were rubbery and the petals were mostly gone. I couldn\u2019t stop laughing, then he couldn\u2019t stop laughing. I kissed him, and it felt like we were two puzzle pieces that just snapped into place.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen I was getting out, he had another surprise for me. I\u2019d seen this band opening at Tattoo the Earth a few weeks prior and I was so impressed by them. They had cassette single they gave out at the concert, I\u2019d met a couple of the band members, and I was obsessed-I told him I needed the album when it came out and gushed about how amazing they were.\u00a0\n\n\nThey didn\u2019t have an album yet, so he\u2019d called Hastings in his college town and asked them to order two CDs so they\u2019d have them on release day. The release date was that morning, so he\u2019d stopped by and picked them up before he came in town. It was Mudvayne\u2019s LD50. He handed me the CD\u00a0and we both cried because I was blown away by it-amazing that he would go through the trouble, but also that he wanted the CD too, because he valued my opinion on music.\u00a0\n\n\nWe were happy and miserable, because we knew he had to drive back and we wouldn\u2019t see each other for weeks. I opened the door and he blurted \u201cI love you\u2026. I\u2019m sorry I definitely didn\u2019t plan to say that!!! I\u2019m sorry!!\u201d I told him I loved him, too, and we hugged and kissed and cried. Eventually we got out and cuddled on my couch watching Jerry Springer at night, and he left with just enough time to get home, shower, and get to his meeting.\n\n\nI knew he was the one, and I was right. We got married on the 4-year anniversary of that day, in the Rose Garden we walked through that night. It was the best date I ever had.",
            "My now husband invited me to a work Christmas party as his date and this was the second time we went out. We got really drunk off wine and decided to crash the night at his friend\u2019s place close by. The friend only had one extra bed so we slept on the same bed and when I woke up in the morning, I saw that he had put a pillow between us. I realized that if he tried doing something that night, I probably wouldn\u2019t have said no because I was in a really happy drunk state. When I saw the pillow I smiled and felt a lot of respect for him. He then got me breakfast and drove 30 mins to drop me home. We\u2019ve been married 6 years and he\u2019s been the same respectful sweetheart. I feel so lucky.",

Obviously, there is a time and a place for all things. But, I am forever fascinated by the human body and am not one bit freaked out by it and all it's bodily functions. I couldn't be with someone that was weird or awkward about their bodily functions. He made me feel comfortable immediately and we married, going on almost 14 yrs. married and 15 years together.

I never asked him to: he just kept doing things to make my life better.  And he also called me by my first name. I had been mom and Honey for so long, I found it weird and comforting. \nHis friend was playing at a local dive and my UK friend and I went with him to wait for his wife (they were separated). He really wanted things to work out with his wife. I was pumping up my friend to flirt with him to make his wife jealous.

Finally I gave in and said \n\u201cI\u2019ll go out with you as long as you take me to every shitty dive bar on the Boulevard. We hit all 6 and got kicked out of the last because he jumped balls on the pool table. It wasn\u2019t early when we got back home but the sky was clear. He asked me if I wanted to go up in the roof with a telescope. I grabbed a hoodie and met him at the ladder. He had chairs and a six pack cooler!

Also with online dating in general, there is so much unclear and slow communication. \n\nI found that with my recent date, the simple act of being clear and me knowing where I stood made me consider another date.

Unfortunately he bombed the second date by forgetting about it and being 20 minutes late and since I guess he was rushing he forgot to brush his teeth too which i immediately noticed and he said since he forgot abt our date he didn\u2019t plan anything so he ended up just taking me to his dorm and introducing me to his roommates and wanted to just talk.

She had always said she wanted a huge party for our 20th, so I turned our 19th into a big thing.  But for some reason when we got back home I felt this need to schedule something else, and before the end of the month I'd put together another vacation in February made out of her favorite things.  On that February vacation we went to Miami Beach and stayed at a beautiful hotel, went on a cruise on the first ship we'd ever been on, and finally spent time at her favorite place in the world, Cocoa Beach.\n\nWhile we were there a rocket launch from Cape Canaveral got delayed until just after 1 AM.  I spent some time digging into it and found us a spot on the beach where we could watch the entire thing, unobstructed by anything else.  Those pictures are from, us watching it on a blanket on the sand, inches away from the tide.  She described it as a 'little red seed, going into the sky'.  She loved every second of it.\n\nWe went back to our cabin and watched her favorite vacation trash reality TV, Cheaters.  A few hours later while we were having a snack before taking a nap she told me this was the happiest she had ever been in her entire life.  The only description I can give of how that made me feel is 'My heart smiled', cheesy as that sounds.  She had that effect on me.\n\nWhen we woke up I took her to a local place she loved.  I had a habit of finding random flowers and shoving them in her hair as an excuse to take pictures of her.  She always started off a little shy when I did that, but eventually she'd relax.  I liked to think it was because she realized why I looked for flowers in the first place.\n\nHere's one more:  [https://imgur.com/a/W52EOnl](https://imgur.com/a/W52EOnl)\n\nMy wife loved dolls, and would fix older ones.  This was one of her favorites.  She asked me once if I cared if she brought a doll with us to something or if it would embarrass me, and I promised her it wouldn't ever happen.  So she brought a doll or two to almost anything we went to: the symphony, family events, friends houses, medical appointments, even shopping.   I even bought her special purses that were built to display them while we were out.  On one of the cruises we went on the waiter asked about the doll the second night she brought it to dinner, and not only did she tell him about it but she asked if he wanted to hold her.  He jumped at the chance.  That look is him finding out the eyes changed colors.",

But when the dust had settled I'd become her caretaker.  She had some medical problems, and a really bad case of white coat syndrome.  But if I was there with her she was better.

After all, that would settle both problems: she got to see the ocean and swim at it in interesting locations, and I couldn't be called if I was literally out of the country without coverage.
