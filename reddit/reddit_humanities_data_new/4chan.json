            "To have a more nuanced topic of conversation, while it's not lofty of an idea to suggest anon doesn't know too much about Christianity if that's their assessment of it I will say I do blame modern religious teaching here.\n\nConsidering my own experience it's not a shocker that we've gotten to this point where movies have done way more to shape our ideas on what the mythology (no ill connotation here) of your religion is than your friend's mom who doesn't have a teaching degree who volunteered for week night Christian teaching. No wonder people don't understand not only the real story, but also have no attachment to its depth or practicality. They did a horrible job selling abstinence to us teenagers so they have no chance even attempting the problem of evil. I would have loved to have learned religious history in my teenage years as it's a sort of hobby of mine to do that now. I'm only just learning what the specific beliefs the sect I grew up with has, how I may disagree, and what other sects or philosophies have better approaches to thing.\n\nAnd I will say this sort of thing pops up in a lot of places, so I'm not just shaking my fist at Sunday school. I genuinely think most people don't know what the hell they believe and attach themselves with these labels, speaking with authority at times, but they really don't know anything about it. Often times I even find people who supposedly fit into that category are the worst at explaining their identity and commonly do things outside of their belief system. Whether that's an anarchist (etymology: without ruler) campaigning for a president or a Roman Catholic who believes in the Nine Circles of Hell, people don't know who they are.

The Gospel is that Christ died for your sins according to the scriptures, was buried, and rose again the third day according to the scriptures (1 Cor 15:1-4). You cannot lose your salvation once you have trusted Jesus. Baptism does not save you. Church attendance does not save you. Mary does not save you. Religion does not save you. Your good works do not save you. Nobody else can save you. Everything to save you has already been done. That is the glorious message of the gospel.

            "We can thank the Babylonian Exile for this. Jewish elites spending many years with Babylonian elites. The Babylonian religion of Zoroastrianism gave the Jewish priests the idea of dualism, where all good comes from one deity and all bad comes from another. \n\nIt made sense in Zoroastrianism because the good creator deity and the evil destroyer deity were roughly of the same power. But in Judaism God is all powerful and omnipotent, hence the literal demonization of Satan as the wellspring of all evil and God being completely good and perfect. Satan was originally humanity's \"adversary,\" more of a judge and tester of faith and humanity. He did evil things, but he was still 100% an instrument of God.\n\nIm paraphrasing to the best I can recall, but in the King James Bible God speaks and says \"I am the creator of all that is good and all that causes woe.\" In the original Hebrew the direct translation has God simply saying, \"I am the creator of all that is good and all that is evil.\" Christianity took the idea of Satan and dualism as a whole and cranked it to 11. It permeates the religion completely.\n\nThe Problem of Evil and the question of God's perfection/ his relationship to Satan have a very easy answer. God is all things, the best good and the worst evil. And I think that makes him a much more compelling character because it shows how much like him humanity really is.\n\nSource: Judaism Studies degree I haven't used in 10 years and am still paying off.",

I'd say that John verse comes the closest while the rest are just sort of random passages about hell (vague ones at that), but even that is within the context of John likening people to satan in the first place, hence saying that their father is the devil and his lies are their lies, rather than that the devil is the father of _all_ lies, and certainly not of evil as a broad concept.\n\nIf god created and commands everything, satan can't be the origin of evil, or a rogue entity outputting power that challenges god or his designs, or even capable of that sort of creation. Nothing in the Bible ascribes him such godlike power without an interpretation so liberal that it's contradicted in _many_ more ways than it's supported.

But it works for Christianity, which says that everything is part of a bigger plan for the greater good, and that god is omnipotent, omniscient and he's the one who created everything. These two statements contradict each other: if god is truly omnipotent and omniscient, why does he need a plan in the first place? He can do everything he wants, why would he cause suffering? Just to test us? If we fail him, doesn't that mean that he failed creating us, and thus denying his perfection? \n\nChristianity is the religion of deference, it's the religion of the status quo. It's the religion of the slave. It teaches him to be happy about his slavery, it tells him that he must obey those in power because he'll be rewarded after death.

No offense but it seems like you're being intentionally obtuse now.\n\n>a punishment for being susceptible (again, he modeled it into us) to temptations (which are part of the world he created). How is that not punishing us for his mistakes?\n\nOnce again, free my guy William.\nIt's not a mistake to make us susceptible to temptations since it's what comes with free will, otherwise it wouldn't be truly free. If we were inherently good with no option to do bad then we wouldn't have free will since we wouldn't be able to choose to do anything other than good.\nFor example let's say you create a robot, you yourself are good and would like for your robot to be so aswell but you want your robot to be like you in the way that he can do bad but actively CHOOSES to do good because it's the right thing. If the robot says fuck it and says \"I want to do bad\" nonetheless then that's on the robot, you gave him the option choose.\n\nI'm probably going to sleep so if you want to continue discussing later you're welcome to send me a DM or continue the thread, nonetheless if you are interested in this I invite you to visit a Catholic church and try speaking with the Father (priest or bishop?
