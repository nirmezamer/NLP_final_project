It's not exclusively tech-heads using it, but they're overrepresented. A lot of the communities there right now are simply trying to replace ones that are already here and will fall apart because they're not being used or moderated well. (Right as I was joining, I saw someone create about thirty clone communities of Reddit subs that they were obviously not actually interested in running well, just so they would own all of them.) But I'm finding it useful and in some ways a lot better than Reddit is at the moment. But then, I've been on Reddit a long time and watched it go from something I liked to something I didn't gradually, so it being more like it was ten years ago (but hopefully with less racism and sexism this time...) is a good thing for me.\n\nHopefully, it will grow and improve the same way that Reddit did, but I understand why some people looking for the same experience they're getting here right now somewhere else. You're just not going to find that.",

The total active users this past month was 70k, up from just 1k on May 31st. The platform is growing rapidly and now has enough active content creators to keep the feed interesting.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the first users on any platform are disproportionately engaged with it. Early adopters are power users who believe in a service. The community is relatively small, but vibrant.\n\nI recommend sorting by top, either past day or past 6-12 hours. Start with local to see what your preferred community is up to, then you can expand to all once you've caught up on your local group.\n\n\\---\n\nAlso, websites these days can work just about as well as an app when done right.

There might be something out there that does what you want even better, you might have to work up the energy to get this place back on track, or you might just need someone to answer your questions about why people are leaving.

Myspace and Livejournal used to have huge amounts of traffic, Skype used to be the defacto voice app.\n\nThe web is transitory, and it's the users who determine which sites and services have traffic. The question is whether or not people are bothered enough by reddit's change of direction to make a change themselves.\n\n-----\n\nBut even if only a small proportion of the users here decide to move... they'll be forming a closer and more tight-knit community - and the people who *are* moving are significantly more likely to be proactive people who care more about their ecosystem - those users also tend to be the ones who create original content rather than rehashing old posts.

They refuse to return the subreddit to normal despite maintaining an active userbase. Unironically, reddit should just de-mod everyone in the mod list at the moment and install their own mods. They would run this place better than these knuckle draggers. They're unironically just endlessly assmad that their dumb little protest didn't work and babyraging about it to this day.",

            "An API is a website or software's backend that allows third parties to pull information about the site or program for the purpose of data collection or third party application development. Reddit, for a long time, allowed free and unlimited access to their API, leading to the creation of many highly unoptomized bots and apps that overuse the reddit API for no reason other than amateurish development.\n\nSee, almost every other company on the planet charges for access to their API. The charge almost always comes down to how many times you access their API, charing some amount of money per 1000 access queries for instance. This is because it costs money to give people access to your API, it causes strain on their servers and has a real, tangible cost in energy to provide access to this information.\n\nReddit decided after a long time of providing API access for free to begin charging for it. This is something that they have ever right to do, it doesn't make them a bad guy in any way for doing so, even if it means some bots and apps no longer become feasible.\n\nAnother technical detail that many people missed in all the morally righteous \"protests\" against the change is that reddit included a provision in the changes that allows a certain amount of free queries. The vast majority of bots fall within the threshold of free API access. This is why automoderator and all the thousands of random bots like haiku detector or whatever still work. A big part of why the protests happened was because mods were complaining that moderating would become too difficult without moderation tools, but they literally didn't lose their moderation tools, they still have access to them.\n\nAt the end of the day, the API protest bullshit was just a bunch of people who had no idea what they were talking about hyping eachother up on some populist anti-corporatist bullshit, then becoming eternally asspained when they didn't get their way like literal children. Reddit is still totally fine, they literally did absolutely nothing wrong with the API changes, and until I explained what an API is just now you didn't even know what one is or that everyone else already charged for access to theirs.",
            "Heh. You assume a staggering amount about my background, clearly. I know full what what an application programming interface is. I've written them. I've used them. I've helped define company policy about their management.\n\nYou went on at great length about pricing and policy, with sweet fuckall about actual technical issues. Because, as you said, you're so full of shit your eyes leak brown liquid.\n\nWhat reddit did was make an unpopular price & policy change, and failed to adequately inform their customers (the users) why it was \"totally fine\". \n\nMy gradual ejection from reddit is due more to policy. Same reason I ejected (completely at this point) from Twitter. Same reason I bailed on Digg. There are alternatives that give me, the consumer, what I want, with policies I accept."

The argument made with your meme basically just says \"You as a DM can homebrew that Necromancers aren't evil, or ask your DM to homebrew it if you're a player\". \nYou also said \"no one can force you to abide the official lore\" yes - fun fact people run games they call \"homebrew\".\n\nSpeaking of homebrew, couldn't that be said to literally every argument posted on DnD? Just apply homebrew!\n\nThe argument tends to pertain to \"Is it [blank] while pertaining to the rules\". Everyone knows you can homebrew things via DM. That's never been what the argument has been.

Like law and chaos, they hold power over multiverse.\n\nSo the way I see it is this: Good characters can use necromancy, but doing so is far more taxing than an evil character doing so, because the act itself is evil. Same with evil characters casting good-aligned spells. Furthermore, using such spells in places steeped in the energies of good/evil ease/tax the process even more. Why do necromancers always appear in haunted places and graveyards? Because the places are steeped in evil energies and make it easier to raise the dead. Same with rituals - infusion of an area with the desired energies.\n\nThe moral side comes when the character has to make a decision: Some spells might be impossible for them to cast if they are too far down that path they are on until they either grow stronger or steer from the path.

Not when you have spells to cast. They seem a lot stronger than they are because of their nova potential, the damage isn't really all that great.\n\nBy making it a bonus action thing, you've actually given a clear incentive for Paladin players to explore their other options.

            "These charges will ironically make the average paladin much better, because they'll be smiting less and casting spells more.",
            "It isn't so much that smites are now a bonus action, its that divine smite became a spell and is now able to be counterspelled that ruins it. Paladins were good for fighting liches, now the lich can just counterspell a crit smite and laugh, as well as rakshasas being immune to smites now, that is what ruined divine smite.",
            "Sure, there\u2019s a lot of good that\u2019s come out of it, but for what they\u2019ve given you, they\u2019ve now made Smite vulnerable to Counterspell, Mage Slayer, likely Silence, any creature with Spell Turning  or Magic Immunity effects and the like, and it inherently makes one of the fan favorite multiclasses (that being Paladin/Barbarian) a shadow of its former self. \n\nIf Treantmonk is to be believed from his analysis of the new Paladin they\u2019ve also nerfed the duration of the Paladin\u2019s subclass capstone. Jeremy mentioned it an hour while Chris corrects him and says his preview book has a different duration, and I highly doubt they\u2019d have increased the duration. \n\nTo pretend the changes are all positive is a disingenuous argument.

It's not upgrading, it's making it viable in the new ecosystem.\n\nMore Channel Divinity sounds nice until you learn that Divine Sense now also uses that resource.\n\nEverything is in context. It's easy to package some of those changes as upgrades until you realize how they interact with the rest of the class.",
            "Honestly I'm not gonna lie, the nova potential of dumping three smites a turn on an enemy as a paladin was always outshone by the fact that doing so invariably ran you out of gas and was just straight up damage inefficient compared to critfishing. I think the actual problem is this just cuts a lot of build diversity for the paladin by subsuming their bonus action into smite",
            "In general I think the changes are fine and some of it is even pretty good, honestly im fine with them making Smite once per turn to reduce nova damage I just disliked that it was made BA tbh since it felt like they really clogged up Paladin\u2019s BA.",
            "I will say a few things about this.\n\n1.) Sacred weapon and Vow of Emnity becoming free actions most likely came from the fact that there is decent bonus action bloat on the paladin class now. It's a buff that is a tad inelegant.\n\n2.) I personally feel that all the other features added to paladin are absolutely great and will make the class feel fun!\n\n3.) The problem to me about smite being bonus action is that it takes away one specific kind of choice you had back in the day and replaces it with a new choice. As any paladin you could start a combat with bonus action spell follow up into smite empowered attacks. \n\n4.) Standard divine smite should just be a class feature that can cut through magic resistance/immunity since it is an ability meant to kill fiends or undead. Turning it into a spell just introduces scenarios where suddenly the anti-unholy countermeasure doesn't work. \n\n5.) If all WOTC wanted to do was limit the number of smites a paladin could do in a turn they could have simply just put a line of text into divine smite stating that you can only smite once per turn. I feel like you lose fun combos overall by tying it to your bonus action.\n\n6.) Despite all my rambling here I love the meme format and people not giving the new design a chance. I personally wanna get my hands on it before I wallow in salt myself.",

            "There\u2019s a lot about the paladin rework I dislike and all of it boils down to how clogged the action economy for the class is now. Paladins we\u2019re in a rare sweet spot of good dps and great survivability. And half of that was being able to smite after landing the hit, the other half was lay on hands being a free action for yourself. I get that they\u2019re trying really hard to make paladin not a smite machine like how warlock is an eldritch blast machine, but I feel they forced the class to juggle too many different skills that all eat your bonus action. Similar to the rogue problem where they have a 100 options to use their reaction but are stuck with only a single reaction a round. I think the paladin class seriously needs some more fine tuning with its action economy. Even something akin to cunning action but for bog standard paladin stuff may help with the action bloat.",
            "This changes are good, but I don\u2019t like Smite being a spell instead of feature. Spell makes it subject to magic resistance, magic immunity and shit like counterspell. I\u2019m simple person and like my good mighty critical megabonk sometimes.",
            "Well, from a balance stand point I see it as an ok. Now, this takes away something that was really cool and that I would wish they dobleled down on instead of removing. I think that Clases feactures that modify common resorces like spellslots into something of their own is the way. Eldritch Blast(Modify to cantrip), Bardic inspirations(Modify), Hunters Mark(experts UA) could be candidates.",
            "Yeah, I was beginning to notice that the BA smites (plus it just being a spell) were the only things that people were complaining about class-wise. That and one thing I saw about a lot of subclasses not being carried over. Everything actually seems, at the very least, fine, and I'm actually pretty excited to migrate to the new edition ( is it a new edition? Are we calling it a new addition?), despite still being kind of new.",
            "Nah, just homebrew stuff to make it super OP. Thats how my player like to play",
            "Would have preferred divine smite not being tied to spell slots.\n\nAltho honestly, the largest issue of the new Paladin for me isn't the Divine Smite overall nerf (it wasn't stellar damage). The largest issue is that you still don't have a solid reason to keep being a Paladin after 6th level or 7th level with a good subclass aura. Outside of rare exceptional campaign scenarios, there is no true mechanical incentive to not multiclass out of Paladin after that in the 2014 rules or the 2024 rules.",
            "My issue is the identity of Paladin was critseeking. The resource management of waiting for a crit or spending it as you go, or preparing for a double smite through using the spell smites with the normal smite, was already a interesting little resource management game while not requiring too much to remember from you. Alongside that, Lay on Hands as a Standard Action always gave you that extra layer of decision making, and was overall engaging even if full casters were objectively better.\n\nSeveral of the features you mention add unneeded complexity when taking into account players who want to try magic but don't necessarily want to rely on it as much as something like Ranger or Artificer to be strong. Paladin was a goto tutorial class on spells, and even if there are buffs that identity is now gone as a result of Smites no longer being stackable and Lay on Hands being a Bonus Action. \n\nWhat I think generally is yeah sure buff Find Steed, but giving them Portent from Divination Wizard as a general class feature or something similar would be really nice for a half caster that would want to be able to use it to potentially ensure failed saves with the special smites, or potentially ensure crits off of smites if they get lucky every so often. It fits very well with the mechanical identity as well as the narrative identity, given divining their perfect strike through their belief in not just their god but themselves being rewarded.",
            "OP certainly believes strongly in the new paladin",
            "*Find steed* isn't made available earlier (level 5 in both cases), but the free casting is new, and now it scales at every upcast, gaining *find greater steed*'s flight at 4th-level.",
            "Right ?! I genuinely can\u2019t wait to play the new Paladin. The steed scaling with spell slot level also means it\u2019ll die way less which is great",
            "No joke, DM\u2019d a 1-20 game with a vengeance paladin and I can count on two hands the amount of times he used actual spells over four years.\n\nNever even used Destructive Wave. :/",
            "Paladins not being smite fighters?! Preposterous /s",

            "In my paladin experience, I use Divine Smites so often because between Channel Divinity setup (Watcher's Will in my case) and taking the Attack action so often, I don't really have the actions to spare on my other spells. Usually I'll cast one concentration spell per combat (maybe *bless*, *spirit shroud*, or *shield of faith*), but after that, it's either Divine Smite or die with spell slots remaining.",
            "I'm curious what spells you think are consistently better to cast than dealing damage. A lot of the spells Paladins have in 5E are concentration based, which is a tough sell for a melee combatant - even if it is constitution based. And most paladins aren't even going to get access to much 3rd level and above casting, with most campaigns ending before level 10. \n\nNote, I think the changes are for the better in 5.5, but don't really think spells are better than smite in 5e",
            "Yeah I personally adore the new Paladin. Playing in 5e I only really smited under two circumstances\n\n- Getting a critical hit\n- I know an enemy is very low.\n\nFor example if I hit a goblin and deal poor damage on my weapon swing, I know a smite will take them out of the initiative for sure. Controlling action economy is always great.\n\nPaladins who can burn 4 smites per turn on their tables really have it good on the long rest department honestly",
            "You can smite with unarmed attacks, but not ranged ones.",
            "You could always smite punch by RaW, just not by Crawford tweet.",
            "On D&D beyond or on the D&D YouTube channel.",
            "That is a very uncommon ability only on beings that are the equivalent of gods. I\u2019m fairly certain you can count on one hand, if not two, the number of creatures that have that ability. \n\nPlus this is a new edition of DnD, monster stat blocks might change.",
            "If the biggest problem with the new paladin only kicks in when fighting two kinds of enemies, one of whom is Tiamat, then it\u2019s probably not a major issue.",
            "this is contentious even in RAW regarding existing smite spells like blinding smite- there's no obvious definition of what 'immune to spells' means. it's not the same as being immune to the EFFECT of spells. if that were the case, surely Tiamat would also ignore shield/mirror image spells?",
            "Smite is a self target spell that increases your weapon damage for one attack. There's a strong case that it bypasses magic immunity, but they need to be really clear about this in the PHB if it's the case.",
            "Maybe we shouldn\u2019t judge based on monsters when the entire MM is getting redesigned?",
            "They aren't the target of the spell, you are.",
            "Counterspelling a Smite is such a niche scenario I honestly see no problem with it, I genuinely feel like people complaining about that are making an issue about something that might happen at most once a campaign and be thematically interesting. Even then, counterspell has gotten very nerfed, it can now be saved with a concentration save against the caster's DC, so a Paladin with decent con can definitely just say no thanks to a Lich's counterspell. PLUS, now when someone counterspells you successfully, you do get your spell back, so even if the paladin gets counterspelled they get to keep their magic.\n\nAs a paladin, I'd be HONORED if a lich decides to waste their reaction on the /possibility/ to counter my low level bonus action spell, while the wizard and cleric are readying up forcecage, banishment, etc. My job is to take aggro. Also, paladin aura now helps you save against counterspells as well.\n\nIf a single monster in the monster manual is what ruined divine smite for you, I really hope you don't see all the creatures that have immunity to radiant damage by default already lol. Rakshasas are nonrelevant to this discussion.",
            "Actually no, liches and tigerdemons are both edge-cases. (they suck dont get me wrong, but those types of fights are *relatively* rare)\n\nBonus Action effects *every* combat against *any* mobile or ranged enemies.  \nPaladins famously suck compared to enemies with even the *teensiest* bit of range or movement advantage, because of their lacklustre ranged or baked-in movement options.  \nWhich is why the subclasses that gain access to Misty Step or similar movement abilities are so iconic.\n\nthe change into being a spell sucks for a bunch of reasons, but its the action economy cost that'll affect every combat in the game.",
            "Yeah, Raksashas are truly known for their tankiness, with their amazing AC of 16 and insane 110hp.\n\nTheir harmfull spells against a paladin would be suggestion, charm person and dominate person, all wisdom based saving throws, which the Paladin are proficient in. The Paladin would have NO chance against that, with their aura of protection + proficiency bonus to a minimum of +8 to WIS saving throws at lvl 10, if their WIS modifier is 0.\n\nThe Raksashas amazing +7 to hit will leave a fucking paladin with AC 20, with a plate and shield with no chance of survival.\n\nYou are absolutely correct. There's nothing a paladin could do about a Raksasha without smites.\n\n*sigh*",
            "Bro. Counterspelling a Smite is such a niche scenario. Trying to claim that \"ruins\" the feature is ridiculous.",
            "we don't know how spells have been changed yet.",
            "That\u2019s why I hate modern day \u201cbalancing\u201d, nothing a martial will ever be can compete against a post 3rd level spell and a smart (or even reads the damn spells) player",
            "Smites are now bonus action on hit, given that's probably in all smites you get to use your concentration on something else and the choice of max damage or using a different smite for the effect",
            "You call the smite after the hit yeah. This is now true for all smites like branding/thundering/blinding smites. Them not requiring concentration anymore means you can finally use them with other spells\n\nAnd !! It also means you can add whichever smite flavor you want on a Crit and it\u2019ll double guaranteed",
            "Smite is still on hit, it just consumes the bonus action to use (meaning only one smite rather than nova smite spam). Lay on hands has also ALWAYS been a full action, it has never been a free action in any way. While I don't love onednd (though it may grow on me) the paladin adjustments are completely fair.",
            "The Lay On Hands change to a bonus action is a buff - it's always been a full action in 5e. I believe you're referencing an extremely lenient house rule on that point.",
            "Lay on hands being a free action for yourself ??? Either I\u2019ve been playing Paladins wrong my whole life or your dm has one of the most lenient house rules ever. Lay on hands has always been an action, even on yourself, right?!\n\nPaladins now have smites, lay, and some spells as a bonus. They have major spells and attack as their main action. And the steed and all the buffing abilities (like vow of enmity and holy weapon) don\u2019t clog your action economy at all now. Vow and Holy are part of your attack action and the steed as always has a turn of its own, only now as a Paladin you get free castings of it to make sure all Paladins are taking advantage of it though.\n\nPaladin is so much better action economy wise now than before. The only negative being the fact that they now can\u2019t spend 4 spell slots in a single round, thing no caster was able to do before.",
            "Hard disagree. What you call a clogged action economy; I call having meaningful options.",
            "And you can still get them sometimes",
            "To each their own!",
            "Just to make sure it's on the record, free castings of spells are always done at the spell's lowest level, so as the Paladin levels up, the free casting of Find Steed quickly loses value because it will only ever summon the weakest possible steed. If they need it to have more HP or be able to fly, they need to use the higher level slot.",
            "It's totally broken. \n\nA class that has guaranteed flight at the 4th level? \n\nJust give me a bow and I'll laugh at any monster.",
            "Is destructive wave good?\n\nI'm currently building a hexblade 2 / swords bard 10 goblin with a focus on melee (I know it's not optimal but it fits for the character and seems fun with flourishes) and I'm thinking of taking destructive wave as a magical secret",
            "I think weapon mastery seems cool, the rest of it is whatever to be honest. It's grand like.",
            "Bless, wrathful smite, aid, command, prayer of healing, locate object, and find steed Id consider all better than divine smite, in terms of 1st and 2nd level spells.",
            "Ranged Smites were the one part I was looking forward to most, so of course they had to get rid of those.",
            "Thanks.  \n\nMy Watcher paladin hates extraplanar beings. I specifically avoided the Find Steed spell because of this. Now it's mandatory? Fuck that.",
            "Yeah Bonus action casting is by far more impactful than edge cases like specific enemy typing honestly. As far as closing gaps goes, I'm very glad paladins now get a free find steed cast once per day and the spell is always known without counting towards the number of spells you need to remember. Having that sweet sweet 80ft of movement without spending your own action economy at the very least during the first turn of combat is always a lifesaver. That and the horses can teleport with you on top now so it's a W all around.",
            "Paladins have *find steed* and then *find greater steed*, frequently giving them better mobility than any melee martial except the monk.",
            "You also make many assumptions there, the main one being that you are assuming the paladin having access to magic weapons when they go to fight this Raksasha, which situation depending they might have.\n\nNow, with divine smite being a spell, the paladin might not have anything with which to hurt this Raksasha. It's immune to spells it doesn't want to be affected by of 6th level and lower and can not be hurt at all by nonmagical weapons. That 16 ac might not seem like a lot, but if your immune to the damage type it literally doesn't matter what the die rolls. A +7 to hit will still hit your hypothetical 20 ac paladin 40 percent of the time, infinitely more often than hurting the Raksasha with a nonmagical weapon.",
            "Right ?! They mention Rakshashas being a problem for smites when a non irrelevant chunk of the high tier monsters monsters have Radiant immunity anyway",
            "Even more so now that you can save against a Counterspell.",
            "That sounds even more op...",
            "Thank you, that has alayed my main concern. I tend to smite only on crits and the thought of 'wasting' the smite on the first attack only for the second to crit was a bit grating.",
            "Unless they changed the spell find steed doesn't have upcasting. Find greater steeds is just a completely diff spell. In both you pick a statblock of a creature.",
            "I think they meant after using a 4th-level spell slot",
            " .....4th level spell slots. Which, at least in 5e, Paladins don't receive until 13th level.",
            "Wizards get flight at 5th, Aasimar get it at 3rd, aarakocra start with it.",
            "It is pretty good.\n\nIt is just an AOE around you that damages the enemies and avoids your allies, so you can use in any situation when there are a few enemies near you.",
            "Before I get into this, please note this is all based on the fact that I said \"consistently better.\"\ud83d\ude05\n\nBless is solid but has the concentration issue.\n\nWrathful smite is ok, 1d6 damage isn't as good as 2d8 even if it is psychic the majority of the time, and the will save always has the potential to fail. \n\nI disagree with Aid - damage is almost always the more optimal option to healing, and you get access to it only after 2nd attack. So you're giving up 2 potential attacks and a potential smite to give everyone 5 bonus hp - which just isn't that much. If you're one of the last ones standing, sure. But that's fairly situational, and I'd think dealing 3d8 damage earlier in the round might have downed the enemy downing your teammates. \n\nCommand is going to be the power level that the DM lets it be. At most you should be able to have an enemy skip their turn, but if you want it to be reliable, you need to invest more points into wisdom, which is probably the 3rd stat investment for the majority of paladins (str and con coming first.) \n\nPrayer of healing takes 10 minutes to cast, for one slot it isn't bad - but most of the time if you have 10 minutes you can take an hour for a short rest. There's times it'll be the right call, but again that's pretty situational. \n\nLocate object is definitely situational. I wouldn't hold back a smite on the potential that I might need to locate an object later - but if I have it and need to find something I'm not going to not use it for the potential smite. \n\nFind steed is solid, but it's an investment that shouldn't require too much recasting - and if it does need to keep getting recast the value of the steed falls off quickly.",
            "I think they wanted to keep paladins as close combat specialists.",
            "I've always made Paladin and Barbarian features work with melee and *thrown* weapon attacks specifically. \n\nAfter *Dark Souls*, the ability for faithful warriors to hurl holy spears is an absolute staple in my mind.",
            "Not all Celestials and Fey are extraplanar beings. Unicorns and Pegasi are native to the material plane, for instance. Besides, no one\u2019s forcing you to use it.",
            "Oh you mean the 10 minute cast-time spells that create entites that struggle to fit into tiny dungeon corridors?  \nSure love playing everyone's favourite game of \"Wide Open Fields &  Wyrmling's Obliging Forever\"",
            "If the DM pits the party against a Raksasha without first granting them reasonable access to magic weapons, something has gone seriously wrong.",
            "Magic weapon spell affects the Raksasha.",
            "I'm not a fan of the Smite change, but assuming a Paladin has a magic weapon by the time they're fighting a Raksasha is a pretty safe assumption. Paladins even get the Magic Weapon spell which would affect a Raksasha because it enchants a weapon.",
            "Rakshasa are cr 13. If the party is fighting a cr 13 monster and has no magic weapons they are either underleveled idiots who got in over their heads or the dm is an arse whose starving their players of loot or ways to spend gold.",
            "A rules change in regards to the dynamic of a fight between a class and monster does not ruin the character class. Are you really that bummed that the DM will not be able to send you into battle against a Raksasha unprepared anymore? Paladins are half-casters, not martials that get a free magic attack. If a paladin was fighting a Raksasha and the only way to damage it is with smites then that already feels like it would be a clunky combat encounter that could've been run better. DND rules don't exist within a vacuum, they exist within a campaign, and you won't just randomly run into an enemy unless your DM decides to put it there, and they SHOULD have you prepared for fights that are coming. It's not unreasonable to assume a paladin would be given a magic sword at some point in a campaign at this level.",
            "That\u2019s why it\u2019s a bonus action now luckily. In 5E Paladins could just Attack, Multiattack, Polearm master bonus attack, and Opportunity attack, then put a hefty smite on every single hit.\n\nNow you can do it just once a turn, which makes it way less swingy and more balanced. Smites are still fucking great mind you, but now they aren\u2019t a massive DM headache",
            "They did indeed change the spell in Playtest 6 to scale with spell slot level. Iirc the free cast is always at the lowest level though.",
            "As of UA6, the last Paladin playtest, Find Steed and Find Greater Steed were merged into a single spell. It summons a set template, the appearance of the steed basically being free flavor. The Paladin chooses Celestial, Fey, or Fiend, and the steed gains a different bonus action ability depending on the choice (1/LR heal for Celestial, 1/LR teleport for Fey, and 1/LR fear effect for Fiend). Its AC is 10+spell level, 5+10 per spell level HP, a 60 foot move speed, and gains a 60 foot fly speed if the spell is cast as a spell of 4th or higher level.\n\nSo, while Paladins get a free casting of Find Steed, that free casting will only ever summon a non-flying steed with 12 AC and 25 HP, even up to 20th level. Unless they specifically added a clause that says the free casting is automatically done at the highest level the Paladin can cast, but that's extremely unlikely because then a Paladin/Sorcerer or Paladin/Bard could summon a free flying mount at level 9 (Paladin 5 to gain the spell, Sorcerer/Bard 4 for the faster spell slot progression - per JC you now round up Paladin/Ranger level when determining spell slots in multiclassing), 4 levels earlier than a single-class Paladin would be able to.",
