            "Your post appears to be one of a number of commonly asked questions about the port city of Boston. Anyway, Royale is fine if you're just trying to get drunk and dance and hookup. The Grand is more of the same as Royale but more expensive and a stricter dress code. Bijou is fine if you're into house music, the last few times I've been to Bijou the crowd was mostly freshly 21 people. Legacy is under Royale and a pretty great queer club if that's you're thing. Good Life, Phoenix Landing, Middlesex, and The Lower Level are all great for underground shows if that's your thing. The vibes at those 4 places are all pretty good. Good Life is my favorite and they open back up this weekend. If you're just looking to get trashed and don't care what you dance to or who you dance around, any of the bars around Haymarket/Faneuil Hall will do. Ned Devine's, Hennessey's, Hong Kong ($1 chicken sticks!), Sissy K's, Coogan's. I think there's a few more I'm missing but those are the big ones. Also, I can't believe I forgot this, but if you're into top 40 or hip hop, Venu, Cure, Icon, and Hava are places to go if you're looking for something a little nicer/fancier/more upscale than what the Faneuil Hall/Haymarket bars and clubs offer. I also forgot about Memoire because it's in the casino but frankly I don't really know anyone who goes to Memoire regularly. It's more of the same stuff they play at the Grand and Royale. Now I think I've named them all.

            "I saw Kyrie Irving at a JP Licks in Boston a week ago. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn\u2019t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, \u201cOh, like you\u2019re doing now?\u201d I was taken aback, and all I could say was \u201cHuh?\u201d but he kept cutting me off and going \u201chuh? huh? huh?\u201d and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my iced cream, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff at the register I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like a hundred gummy bears in his hands without paying.\n\nThe girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like \u201cSir, you need to pay for those first.\u201d At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.\n\nWhen she took the bears and started weighing them in a cup, he stopped her and told her to weigh them each individually \u201cto prevent any electrical infetterence,\u201d and then turned around and winked at me. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a word. After she weighed each bear and put them back in a cup and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",
