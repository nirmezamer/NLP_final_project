        "content": "Got a question about JR Passes or IC cards (Suica/Pasmo/ICOCA/etc)? Read through the information below and feel free to ask additional questions in this thread! Please [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/search/?q=%22Do%20you%20have%20a%20JR%20Pass%20or%20IC%20Card%20(Suica%2FPasmo%2Fetc.)%20question%3F%22&restrict_sr=1&sort=new) for old versions of this megathread.\n\n## JR Pass Info\n\nThe nationwide JR Pass is a travel pass that allows train and bus travel for a fixed cost over a certain period of days on Japan Railways (JR) services. For a comprehensive source of information on the pass, check out [our wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/jrpass/) or [Japan Guide\u2019s JR Pass page](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361.html).\n\nThe JR Pass can be purchased in one of two ways:\n* Online at the [official site](https://japanrailpass.net/en/)\n* Online from an authorized retailer (also often called a \"third-party seller\")\n\nThere is no way to be certain if a JR Pass will be valuable for you without knowing your exact itinerary and doing the math out. If you are trying to work out whether a JR Pass is the right choice for you, here are some calculators:\n* [JRPass.com\u2019s calculator](https://www.jrpass.com/farecalculator)\n* [Japan Guide\u2019s calculator](https://www.japan-guide.com/railpass/)\n* [Daisuki calculator](https://www.daisuki.com.br/jrpass_calculator.html)\n\n**As of October 1, 2023, the nationwide JR Pass and regional JR Passes have increased in price significantly.** The price increase makes it so that there are _very few itineraries_ that the nationwide JR Pass will be worth it for. For more information and discussion on the price increase, see [this search result of prior discussion threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/search/?q=jr+pass+increase).\n\n## IC Card Info (Suica, Pasmo, ICOCA, etc.)\n\n### General Information\n\nAn IC card is a stored-value card used to pay for transportation in Japan. That means you can load the card with money and use the card to pay for trains, buses, etc by tapping the card at train station gates or fare readers. Even if you have a JR Pass or other travel pass, an IC card is recommended because it can be used across transportation systems operated by many different transit companies, as well as for payment at convenience stores, restaurants, shops, vending machines, and other locations.\n\nFor tourism purposes, there are nine major IC cards and all of them are completely interchangeable and usable in each other's regions, so it doesn\u2019t really matter which one you get. Where you start your travels in Japan often dictates what IC card you get, since different IC cards originate in different regions, but then you'll be able to use it during most of your traveling, even if you move to a different region. For general information on IC cards, see [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/iccards/) or [Japan Guide\u2019s IC card page](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html).\n\n## Physical IC Cards\n\nCurrently, sales of regular Suica, named Suica, regular Pasmo, and named Pasmo cards [are _technically_ suspended due to a semiconductor shortage](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/news/sale-of-pasmo-and-suica-cards-suspended-except-those-for-tourists-080223) (except children's versions and commuter versions). That said, there have been recent reports in early 2024 of people getting regular Suica cards at some stations in Tokyo.\n\n**If you are landing in/starting your trip in Tokyo,** tourists can still get:\n\n* A [Welcome Suica](https://www.jreast.co.jp/multi/en/welcomesuica/welcomesuica.html) at Haneda Airport (HND) or a [Pasmo Passport](https://www.pasmo.co.jp/visitors/en/) at both Tokyo airports (HND and NRT) (**Note:** Pasmo Passport will be discontinued in August 2024, and may be subject to limited availability before then, based on supply)\n* _Possibly_ a regular Suica at some major JR East stations in Tokyo (subject to limited availability)\n* _Possibly_ a [Toica IC card](https://global.jr-central.co.jp/en/tickets/buy/toica/) at the JR Central portions of Tokyo Station (Yaesu North Exit) and Shinagawa Station (Shinkansen North Exit) (subject to limited availability)\n* A  digital IC card (see next section for more information)\n\nA Welcome Suica or Pasmo Passport acts exactly like a regular IC card, with two exceptions: it is only valid for 28 days, and it cannot be refunded. Please see [this thread and its top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/15ebhwb/issuing_of_personalized_suica_and_pasmo_cards_is/) for information.\n\n**If you are starting your trip in another region** (e.g., Kansai, Kyushu, etc.), sales of their regional IC cards are unaffected by Suica and Pasmo shortages. Please see [this page](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html) to identify which card you'll get, and it should be available at airports and train stations in those regions.\n\n### Digital IC Cards\n\nIf you are looking to get a digital IC card, please note that digital Suica, Pasmo, and ICOCA cards can only be used on iPhones, Apple Watches, or *Japanese* Android phones (this means the phone was purchased in Japan). For instructions on how to get a digital IC card in Apple Wallet, see [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207155). You _do not_ need the Suica or Pasmo apps (which are all in Japanese) in order to get a digital IC card. It can be loaded and used entirely through Apple Wallet.\n\nPlease note that not all credit cards work to load a digital IC card. Amex cards seem to have the highest success rate, but Mastercards and Visas can be flaky. Although Visa previously didn't work at all, as of December 2023, loading a digital Suica with some Visa credits cards seems to work, although not all of them. See this [At A Distance blog post](https://atadistance.net/all-about-apple-pay-suica-recharge/) for more info and updates. It is not uncommon to not have any of your cards work to load a digital IC card, and if that happens, you might need to stick with a physical IC card.\n\nKeep in mind that digital IC cards cannot be refunded (that requires a Japanese bank account), so you will need to burn down whatever value you\u2019ve loaded onto them before the end of your trip.\n\n### IC Card FAQ\n\n**I have an old IC card from a previous trip. Can I use it on my upcoming trip?**\n\n> IC cards are valid for ten years after their last date of use, so if you received the card and/or used the card in/after 2014, it\u2019ll work.\n\n**Can more than one person use the same IC card for travel?**\n\n> No. All travelers who want to use IC cards on transit need to have their own card. Most transit in Japan is distance-based, and the card is \u201ckeeping track\u201d of your journey, and it can only keep track of one at a time.\n\n**Are there children\u2019s IC cards? How do I get one for my child?**\n\n> Children under six years old can ride transit for free. If your child is between the ages of six and eleven, you can get a children\u2019s IC card from JR offices by presenting the child\u2019s passport for proof of age. There are also Welcome Suica and Pasmo Passport versions for children. If you are getting IC cards at the airport, they are able to provide children\u2019s cards.\n\n**Can I load money onto a physical IC card with a credit card?**\n\n> No. Physical IC cards can only be loaded with cash, which can be done at ticket machines in train stations, convenience stores, and 7-Eleven ATMs. \n\n**I have a physical IC card and I want to transfer it to my phone. If I do that, can I still use the physical card?**\n\n> No. Once you \u201cmove\u201d the physical card to your phone and turn it into a digital card, the physical card becomes invalid. It cannot be used or reactivated.\n\n**I\u2019m landing in Tokyo, but then I\u2019m going to Osaka and Kyoto. Do I need a suica in Tokyo and then an ICOCA in Osaka/Kyoto?**\n\n> No. Once you have one of the major IC cards, it can be used pretty much anywhere. There are some exceptions to this, but they are mostly on individual lines or in specific rural regions. If you are traveling to major tourism cities such as Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, etc., you are likely fine with whatever IC card you originally received upon arrival.\n\n**Should I buy an IC card online before arriving in Japan?**\n\n> If you want to get an IC card online from a reputable vendor, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Some of the authorized JR Pass website (as well as other websites targeted at tourists) will sell them bundled with other purchases. That said, there isn\u2019t really any reason to get your card ahead of time. If you\u2019re landing in Tokyo, the 28-day Welcome Suica or Pasmo Passport is good enough for most tourists. And if you do end up in the country for longer than 28 days, you can simply get an IC card from another region once you\u2019re in one (such as the ICOCA from Kansai).\n\n**Help! I tried to load my digital IC card through Apple Wallet and the transaction didn't go through! What do I do?**\n\n> To start, did you attempt to create it/load it overnight in Japan? The digital system goes down for maintenance from about 1am to 5am JST, so try again during Japan's daytime hours. Beyond that, Visa cards often cannot be used to load digital IC cards. Mastercards sometimes have issues too, depending on the issuing bank. Unfortunately, if you can't find a digital card + credit card combo that works for you, you may not be able to use digital IC cards.\n\n### Recent IC Card Threads\n\nTo see some recent discussion on IC cards, check out [the following threads from our search results here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/search/?q=IC+card).",

Is this correct?\n\nWe are planning several long distance trips during our stay in Japan and believe the JR pass will be worth it for us.\n\nI also understand that if we buy the JR pass from the official website, when we get to Japan, we will need to present our passports with the temporary visitor stamp, the numbers in the reservation code sent to our email, and \\*the same credit card used to purchase the JR pass, in the same name as the traveler.\\*\n\nAs per the website, it says \"Payment can only be made with a credit card. The credit card must be in the purchaser's name. For children who do not have their own credit cards, the JAPAN RAIL PASS can be purchased if the itinerary is the same as that of the person who is making the payment.\"\n\nIt specifically mentions children, but would it be okay for me to also pay for a JR pass for my husband using my credit card?\n\nAnother complicating factor is that I have a US passport and he has a Colombian passport.

If this happens, it's no big deal-the gates just won't let you leave, so you'll need to give the station attendant your card and pay the fare in cash or have it taken from the card manually. \n\nThere are actually three components to a shinkansen ticket- the base fare (what you would pay to travel the same distance on normal trains), the limited express fare (what you pay for going fast), and the seat reservation (what you pay to have your desired seat-mandatory on some routes, optional on others).  \n\nOn paper tickets, the seat reservation is almost always combined with the limited express fare ticket, which is then *sometimes* combined with the base fare ticket. A paper base fare ticket often is for city \"zone\", meaning you can get on at any station in that zone, travel to the shinkansen station, and go from there (putting in both your base fare and limited express fare tickets into the gate), and this can save a bit of money in some cases where you would otherwise need to pay to travel to the shinkansen departure station. \n\nIf you just put where you are traveling from and where you are going to in a machine (or at a service desk), you will get the paper tickets you need, so I recommend this for long-distance travel.",
            "THISSSS IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER FOR THIS",
            "Yes you're right.\n\nThe fancy trains (shinkansen, limited express trains, Narita express, etc...) have supplimental fees in addition to the base fare. So you can purchase just the additional fare ticket, and use your IC card for the base fare. Or you can purchase both the ticket and the supplimental ticket in one go and then not use the IC card at all for that route. \n\nEverything else you can just use your IC card without supplemental fees.\n\nBasically the ticket gates always take base fares, the supplimental fares and seat reservations are not used unless they are being checked by an attendant on the train just to ensure you have one.",
            "Can confirm, was able to get a regular green Suica card from the JR east ticket counter at Narita T2, despite the signs they had up that said Suica sales were suspended. I think it is only for travellers though",
            "That is the correct official website, yes.\n\nYou can pay for all the JR Passes on the same credit card. When you pick them up, you'll need to present a passport for every person to prove you are all tourists. What passport you have doesn't make a difference, as long as you're all tourists with a \"temporary visitor\" sticker.",
            "There is no difference between the IC card companies.  The normal pasmo or Suica has a longer term expiry (10 years) while the tourist versions expire in a month.\n\nIf you can get a digital one, then do it.  It\u2019ll save you time.  If you can\u2019t, the IC card available in Sapporo, Kitaca, can be used anywhere other IC cards are accepted.\n\nThere is no \u201cworth it\u201d since you\u2019re not purchasing these.  They\u2019re simply a payment method.  I suggest reading the body of the thread.",
            "They are all the same functionally and will work wherever an IC card is supported. Welcome Suica and Pasmo Passport are just tourist versions of the same cards that expire after 28 days. Pasmo Passport also gives you special discounts at certain places.",
            "Did you get the welcome suica card or the regular penguin card?",
            "Did you go to the Skyliner and Keisei office and they told you they were sold out of Pasmo cards or did you just go to the JR office? Just wondering bc I\u2019m hoping to get the Pasmo Passport for the cute design lol.",
            "IC card does not work natively on the Shinkansen.  It kind of does but that\u2019s only if you buy online, connect your card, etc\u2026\n\nIf you\u2019re talking about local lines in Tokyo and Osaka, yes, it works on all JR owned lines and the other companies as well.",
            "Tokyo -> Mt. Fuji can mean a lot of things - are you riding the train to Shizuoka/Fuji-shi? Are you going to Kawaguchiko via Fuji Excursion train?\n\nMeanwhile, getting to Osaka is a Shinkansen ticket, so you will need to buy that separately.",

            "A digital IC card can be reloaded with cash at some train station machines (there are ones with little platforms for a phone), any convenience store, and 7-Eleven ATMs. So you should theoretically be able to do that, although hopefully the jailbreaking didn't mess anything up in that regard.",
            "They have a [website](https://www.jrkyushu.co.jp/english/train/yufuin_no_mori.html) to book tickets.",
            "I'd also wondering this because the Pasmo site only lists Narita now (I thought they had Haneda listed at one time when I previously looked into it). So maybe for our kids the best option at Haneda is now Welcome Suica.",
            "The JR West link is for the official site. The official site will send you an email confirmation, and you'll use that and your credit card and passport to pick up the JR Pass once you're in Japan. They do not mail you an exchange voucher. And it's correct that you cannot buy it until 30 days in advance\u2014that's just how things are done in Japan. It's the same for train tickets/bus tickets/etc.\n\nThird-party sites like jrpass.com are the ones that will typically mail you an exchange voucher. Historically, it was cheaper to buy JR Passes through third-party sites (although not anymore since October 2023), so that's why you'll likely see a lot of old advice to buy from a third-party and get an exchange voucher mailed to you.\n\nThese days, there is basically no reason to buy from anywhere other than the official website.",
            "Pretty much anything named \"Limited Express\" or \"Shinkansen\" requires an additional limited express supplement. Google Maps will tell you if the train is a limited express, and it usually also says it on signage on the platform.",

            "This early, it is hard to tell what the card situation will look like by then. There will likely still be some sort of IC card available that you can get somewhere when you get there. IC cards just makes everything simpler when using transit, but if you have members who don't mind knowing exactly where they're going and using the signage to determine their fares for the trip, then tickets should be fine. If they have iphones, see if they can setup an IC card on it.",

With the pass you will have to plan to make sure you\u2019re only taking those lines.  Sometimes it\u2019s not the most efficient way to get from point a to point b.  If you\u2019d rather not deal with what company runs what train line then an IC card is easier.  It can also be used on the Keisei Skyliner.",

            "JR Pass only works on JR lines, so if you can pick up an IC Card, it will likely help you out a lot. Otherwise, any time you're riding on a non-JR line, you'll need to pay for a paper ticket.",

            "It's not _required_, sure, but it does really make things a lot easier, especially if you tend to run late for stuff or are trying to make tight connections between different operators and so on. It's also nice to be able to pay for stuff in konbini and some restaurants with them, and generally just not have to plan as much in advance.\n\nDespite all the horrible communication and confusion, it's really not hard at all to get an IC card:\n\n- Arriving in Tokyo @ Haneda? Get a Welcome Suica at the Terminal 3 station TVM.\n- Arriving in Tokyo @ Narita? Get a PASMO PASSPORT at the Skyliner/Keisei desk.\n- Missed getting one at either of the Tokyo airports, e.g. if you arrived after hours, or if you're here for over a month? Get a regular green Suica from a JR East Travel Service Center near you. \n- Arriving anywhere else that's not Tokyo? Even easier, get your local variant (ICOCA, manaca, SUGOCA, Kitaca, etc.) from a TVM at train station.",
            "One other very minor consideration is that the fare using an IC card is (usually) a couple of yen cheaper than paper tickets, and this does add up, especially if you have to switch lines a lot during your travels.",
            "I think it saves time to have a form of IC card, just been there and the amount of times I had to top it up was maybe 3 or 4 times? Loaded it with 3000 yen each time I think. With an IC card you don't have to worry about getting tickets and be on time. Also, you can top it up right in front of the entrance/exit if access is denied.\n\noh and you can use it literally everywhere, on pretty much every bus so yeah, give it a go next time.

To add to the other comment, an IC card can only be in one \"place\" at the same time, because the value is stored locally on that card (whether it's phyical or on a phone). So there's no such thing as remotely loading an IC card or similar.",
            "> because I read that only with the Pass you can book the seats in advance\n\nI'm not sure where you got the idea that only the JR Pass can make advanced reservations. How would normal Japanese people buy tickets, then? Of course you can buy tickets in advance if you want.\n\nShinkansen tickets can be booked up to 30 days in advance, either in person or online through [SmartEX](https://smart-ex.jp/en/index.php) (for your route). So you can book ahead online or even days/hours ahead in person.\n\nOn the route you're taking from Tokyo to Osaka/Kyoto, there are like 6-10 trains per hour. Aside from national holiday weeks (like Golden Week, New Year's, etc.), they don't sell out. You can buy them minutes in advance at the station. The airport trains don't really sell out, either, and there are multiple ways to get from Narita into Tokyo.\n\n> the trains are always crowded\n\nFor shinkansen, this isn't really true outside of holidays. For regular local trains, of course those can get crowded, especially during rush hour.\n\n> Also, if we travel with 2 suitcases of 25 kg, will there be any problem with the trains or even with the metro - I understand there is not enough room to travel with big luggage, is that true?\n\nFor the shinkansen, it's size that matters more than weight. [Oversized luggage](https://global.jr-central.co.jp/en/info/oversized-baggage/) needs special reservations so that it can go in the special storage areas of the train car. Anything smaller can fit overhead (if you can lift it) or sit at your feet (there's a lot of room on shinkansen trains).\n\nThere aren't really limits on the luggage you can take on the metro/local lines. That said, trains/stations in cities do get crowded, so you might find it's hard to navigate with your luggage or squish into train cars with other people during busy times of day. There are also a lot of stairs/escalators in stations and fewer elevators, so you might spend extra time trying to find elevators if you aren't comfortable lugging your bags around.",

            "9am-11 pm usually",
            "this is what we did",
            "Kiyomizudera opens at 6AM, Fushimi Inari and Arashiyama Bamboo Forest is open 24 hours I believe, and Philosopher\u2019s Path would be a nice chill walk (not sure if there\u2019d be light at that time here though so research that) :)",
            "I was heading to the first shinkansen for my day trips.  (This was before the JR Pass price got jacked up.)  Was often rolling out of Tokyo Station 6:30sih.",
            "Apart from hikes, temples etc., you\u2019re 100% right. Most shops, museums, other attractions don\u2019t open until 10. I generally went out from 9.30ish, came back for a rest around 3pm, then went back out at 5 or 6 (most shops are open until at least 8pm, some until 10pm).",
            "Hikes/parks and a day trip to Kamakura",
            "About the same here. Sleeping in japan is overrated. I can sleep when I'm back home. 6am is a great time to start to see sun rising and \"empty\" syreets and parks.",
            "Kiyomizudera was the only time I was at a site at 6am. Then walked to Gion. It was great and was back at my hotel at 9ish to nap until lunch. lol.",
            "There was light at about 4:30 every morning last month when we were there.",
            "Fine. But isn't Kiyomizudera also about seeing the street and the shops that lead to it? I also liked to see locals in traditional clothes (not the tourists), I believe they were there for a coming of age thing, I saw some sensei with their pupils (looked like some martial arts theme), begging soto zen monks or just everyday people dropping by, how they purify themselves etc. I would assume 6am would be soulless."
