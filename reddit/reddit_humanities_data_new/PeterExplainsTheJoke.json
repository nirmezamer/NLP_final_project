Before Fortnite became a thing they were wildly successful making GTA V videos and, more specific to this post, GMOD videos. Most of them are still around and good friends with each other, and still successfully making videos, but their hayday was 2014-2018.

In Garry\u2019s Mod, the popular sandbox mod for Half-Life 2, there is a massive community workshop in which people can upload custom maps, weapons, and even player models. The recurring members of Vanoss Gaming\u2019s YouTube videos used the pictured characters as their player models in-game, hence the joke of them being pictured in one place.\n\nChris Griffin out.\u201d - good explanation \ud83d\udc4d\n\n[Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/s/fVT7TVoZHC)\n\nu/ChillyAmber\n\n\u201cVanoss crew but It\u2019s probably also about how awful mini ladd was because he groomed some minors (he often used the Mario player model in gmod)\u201d\n\n[Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/s/ZLGh5XO1S8)\n\nu/Chiefdragonborn\n\n\u201cLooks like an old meme from a [gamer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanossgaming/s/KNvtRSnbn4)\u201d\n\n[Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/s/WDOJg4RjfP)\n\n[Nothing](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/s/wXk7vQwOPm)\n\nu/Solid-Positive6751\n\n\u201cIt appears to be the character models used by the Vanoss crew before they got their \u201cofficial\u201d ones in Garry\u2019s Mod.

Dantes says that he hopes the user succeeds at their suicide, stating that they are a failure in all other ways. The way it\u2019s structured makes the reply almost seems like a compliment however, the references to suicide within the reply obviously turn this around as a fancy way to say \u201ckill yourself\u201d. That last sentence itself \u201cYou\u2019ve been a failure your entire life, I only hope that you succeed one time\u201d doesn\u2019t mean anything without the context of the prior message and alone could be used in the context of a friend encouraging their other friend to do something well. It\u2019s obvious what he\u2019s saying but the way he says it is amazing.

One of his friends(supposedly his \"best friend\" as I'm finding out from all his fanboys DMing me hate in these comments) leaked a conversation that revealed one of the main reasons they broke up was she got pregnant and went back home to Germany to get an abortion which he let her do by herself while he stayed home to stream League of Legends because hes pathetic. This has resulted in some trolling online of him and his girlfriend and he has naturally responded to these trolls like he responds to many things that make him mad(even though he claims in this post to \"not normally do this\") by telling one of the trolls to kill themselves(specifically by hanging) as that would be the only time their parents had ever been happy since they've existed.",
