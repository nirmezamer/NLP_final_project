They make fun of me for being a vampire because my house is always dark except the room I am actively in.  I'm also always turning off lights in vacant rooms at the gym or barn. It's a \"must conserve, save the planet\" compulsion.",

            "Yup, even in the 1970s and 80s.",
            "Definitely. I grew up in a paycheck to paycheck house, so it was good to not be wasteful. We had well water, but I heard that the outside didn't need air conditioning alot.  No silly quips about the lights tho",
            "Always have and still do. It wasn\u2019t so much of a money saving endeavor, more of a \u201cdon\u2019t be wasteful\u201d lesson?\n\nThough I generally don\u2019t like overhead lights much. I have a few lamps that stay on, otherwise I\u2019d fall more\u2026",
            "My parents always forget either to turn off the lights or they purposely leave it on. I\u2019m the one that always has to tell them to turn it off or I have to do it myself",
            "YES. I still do from habit.\n\nSimilarly, any time I would open the refrigerator and take more than a *second*, my parents would say, \"that's not an air conditioner, kid!\"",
            "Oh yes. And I've started teaching my son to shut off lights and shut the door we don't pay to air condition the yard!",
            "If you weren't coming back? Yes.\u00a0\n\n\nBut lights in common and frequently used rooms were always on, like the kitchen and living room. Dining room, bedrooms, bathrooms you turned off when done.\u00a0",
            "No actually I didn't...but I do it anyway because I never saw the point of leaving them on when I wasn't using them. I told my old roommate once \"Are you making sure the ghosts can see you easier? No? Ok, then turn off the lights.\" She was terrified of ghosts seeing her naked....",
            "Yep. Now I annoy the hell out of my partner telling her to do this.",

            "yes now I don't turn the lights on if I don't have too and big lights piss me off so lamps and candle warmers are my go too. \n\nMy husband doesn't turn the lights off after him and it annoys me to my core",
            "Yup! My cousins, however, did not.",
            "Yes, but apparently my husband wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m not sure he knows how light switches work.",
            "Yes, all the time. Also not to flip them off and on really fast too. To this day I\u2019ll never understand why my brother and I thought that was so amusing.",
            "Yep. Similar reasons. Even today, if I am stepping out of a room for any length of time, light goes off (albeit more for environmental reasons than cost). The boost of electricity needed to turn on an LED is so minuscule that it is equivalent to leaving the light on for tenths of a second.",
            "Yes but we were on section 8 and every type of government assistance you could think of so it was just a reason to fight. As an adult who pays the electricity, I don\u2019t care if lights are left on but I do like to watch tv and sleep in complete darkness so they\u2019re usually off unless we\u2019re doing something. The bill is only high from the AC\u2019s in the summer and I will leave those on if it means I\u2019m comfortable.",
            "I have google mini and it turns all smart bulb lights off easily. All I do is say Hey Google, turn off ____ lights.",
            "I was also born in a barn apparently.",
            "\"Do you think I'm made of money?!\"",
            "Yup. It\u2019s not so much an issue now with LEDs but back in the day the regular incandescent bulbs burned out a lot.\n\nI turn off the lights in unoccupied rooms except for the overhead in my kitchen in the winter because I use it like a nightlight.",
            "of course",
            "Yeah",
            "Yes.",
            "At home I usually did this unless I was returning to a room shortly. Although at college we all kinda stopped caring since we weren\u2019t paying for electricity and every time I\u2019m home I have to readjust a bit",
            "Yes",
            "Yes",
            "Yep all the dam time",
            "They didn\u2019t really stress it & it wasn\u2019t ever really a conversation topic or anything, but I definitely grew up with that as a habit.",
            "If I forget to turn off a light, it bothers me, so much so that even after i turn it off, i still feel remorse.   Turning off lights was ingrained into every fiber of my being",
            "I don't remember this being a big deal at all.",
            "My parents did, but I definitely leave lights on quite frequently in my adulthood",
            "Yes indeed.  To this day I turn off lights, especially when my roomie leaves them on IN BROAD DAYLIGHT when he leaves for work",
            "LOCK OFF THE LIGHT!\n\nwas a common saying in my household",
            "Absolutely. My dad was adamant about that.",
            "I don't stress it nearly as much as a grown man now but I still feel that pull to turn the lights off when I leave the room",
            "Yes. My grandpa was also strict about the fridge. He didn\u2019t like you to keep the door open for long. There was no hmm-ing and huh-ing allowed. You had to have exactly in mind what you were grabbing and it was a race against time to get in and get out. I think he\u2019s just weird though but most of my childhood I remember him making comments of \u201cagh! My electric bill!\u201d lol.",
            "Yes, but I thought it was because I was a kid during the energy crisis (Gen X). My mom called it \"bubblegum money\", as in, the money we saved on electricity would ostensibly go toward money for candy lol. We weren't poor. I feel like it is just good manners. But I've lived with people who don't turn off a light when they leave a room and I get irrationally angry about it. Total pet peeve. Zero tolerance.",
            "no, they said angels die and communism wins when you turn off lights, A/C, heating or closed the fridge!\n\n/s",
            "Hell no, but we do it anyways now LOL",
            "Yes. I still hate lights being on when no one is in the room.",
            "Yes",
            "yup. my dad was always very adamant to turn off lights if we weren\u2019t using the room they were on in",
            "I use motion sensor switches everywhere except bedrooms. The lights turns off after 5 to 15 minutes of no motion depending on which area.",
            "When not in use, turn off the juice!",
            "Yes. At home and at school.",
            "I think they told me once or twice. I didn't give a shit and they didn't care enough to turn the lights off after me or punish me for it.",
            "Growing up it\u2019s like my parents always kept the house dim. I remember using a smaller lamp to light my room. But I don\u2019t ever recall them being strict about having lights off. I never have liked things being bright personally. But since working nights, I\u2019ve found that all my lights usually stay on when I\u2019m home. I never cut them off. I even sleep with the light on in my bedroom. I\u2019ll only cut it off occasionally to settle my dogs down.",
            "Yes, my Dad always threatened to enforce the dime rule, as in 1 dime for every light left on. He never did, but I still had to hear about it a lot.",
            "Yes. While growing up, my parents always drilled it into our heads to turn off the lights when we were done in that room. Now I'm in their place and fighting to get my kids to remember to turn off the lights when they are done in the room.",
            "When we were poor, yes. After we weren't, and especially since LED bulbs, never.",
            "Yep, I'm in my 40s. So growing up was when we all still used incandescents. So every little thing counts back then. Nowadays of course, LEDs allows us to slide a bit on lights. Though I tend to turn lights off if not in use due to habit and I just don't like lights on if not in use.",
            "I've already turned the lights off 4 times on my roommate tonight. It's just habit when I leave a room.",
            "Maybe?  Probably?  Right now. I won't even turn *on* lights unless it's absolutely necessary.",
            "Yes. It was part of the whole \u201cI\u2019m not refrigerating the whole outdoors\u201d mentality when we\u2019d leave a door or window open. On the whole I totally understood the idea of turning things off when leaving the room for both financial and environmental reasons, but my room was improperly ventilated so I\u2019d always leave a fan on and my dad would turn it off to save energy and we\u2019d get into fights about it because my room was several degrees hotter than the rest of the house in the summer and reverse in the winter.",
            "Sometimes my father \"encouraged\" me to turn off the lights when I was still in a room.  Would remove my night light as a kid and as a teen would say that unless I was looking at something, I was wasting electricity.  Having the ceiling light on to reduce eye strain while gaming  at night was an enraging waste of electricity.\n\nIf I left a room without turning the light off he'd scream at me for it.\n\nCould never figure out his deal with lights.  He earned a comfortable income from his job so it's not like we were broke.",
            "Yup. They weren't particularly strict about it, but they generally discouraged keeping on lights just for the sake of it and always told me to turn off lights I wasn't using. Ironically, as they get older they tend to forget this.\n\nI still do that even now that I'm not really paying my power bill (utilities included in my flat rent).",
            "Absolutely. Also, I wasn't born in a barn - a reminder to shut the door.",
            "Wasn't encouraged it was mandatory and caused anger if we forgot. Then he had back to back strokes and he too started forgetting",
            "Yes, and now that I pay my own electric bill I'm even more inclined to do it.",
            "Yes she did.",
            "And closing the doors. Leaving doors open was often met by the sarcastic question \u201cwere you born in a barn?\u201d",
            "In the UK, the phrase when there are too many lights left on in a house is \u201c[it\u2019s like Blackpool illuminations in here](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/like_Blackpool_Illuminations#:~:text=(informal%2C%20British%2C%20simile),like%20Blackpool%20Illuminations%20in%20here)!\u201d, which is an annual light show festival in a northern seaside town.  \nI\u2019d imagine you could have a US version, \u201cit\u2019s like the Vegas Strip in here\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s like Time\u2019s square in here\u201d or something like that.",
            "It\u2019s SO much worse than this.\n\nYes, except my father would demand that we CLOSE the lights.  Not turn off. But CLOSE.\n\nPretty sure that\u2019s the trauma that explains my life\u2019s failings. Still makes me shudder.",
            "Absolutely, also regularly got scolded for it.",
            "Yes unless I was coming right back.",
            "I always turn off the lights when I leave a room and I used to get in trouble when I didn't turn off all my lights in my room when I left for school.",
            "The only time I leave a light on in a room I'm not inside I as a reminder. If I'm letting something cool before I put it in the fridge, I leave the small overhead light on for example. It helps me a lot. Apart from that, lights are off unless I need them to see.",
            "Every time. My wife still does this.",
            "Yes. Or, if we left the front door open \"What are you trying to do? Heat/air condition the whole world?\"",
            "Yes.  And I still do it to this day.  And now have the added benefit of doing it for my wife & daughter as well.",
            "Absolutely!  Except now I\u2019m the one doing the encouraging.",
            "I'm 20 but im such a stickler for turning off lights when you leave a room and my roommates are so ass at it it's one of my biggest pet peeves lol",
            "My grandfather would come over and say the opposite.  He did own shares in the power company and he would come in and turn on all the lights in the house as a joke.  \n\nBut we were taught to turn off the lights.  My kids were too, but they never do.",
            "Yes.",
            "Absolutely.  \n\nIt didn\u2019t take and my spouse demands the same thing.  I have nicknamed her \u201cthe Princess of darkness.\u201d",
            "Yes, I do turn off the lights in any room I\u2019m not in. I know the cost is negligible with LED bulbs, but it still seems wasteful to have lights on if I\u2019m not in there.",
            "Not that often as we didn't have an excess of lights in our house. But closing the doors was a big thing. We had dogs and I would often get reminded to get them through the door quickly so we weren't \"heating or cooling the outdoors\".",
            "Yup. My parents were constantly bugging me to turn off the lights\u2026 while taking numerous and expensive vacations and buying expensive furniture. But sure, the kids leaving on the lights was the financial problem. ;)\n\nMy husband bugs our kids about the lights now. I don\u2019t really get on them about it\u2026",
            "I feel like a good potion of my home life is spent going around the house and turning off lights behind my wife and kids.",
            "Yep. My friends and I talk about the differences in our light/water bills, since it's one of the few utilities we actually have to go look at. I live overseas now but I spend a good 2/3 of what my friends do. And a big part of that is that nothing is ever on in a room that I'm not in. The other part is that I run my AC super strong for like an hour before I come home in an hour after and then turn it off.",
            "Ha yeah, the lights are truly not a big deal.\n\nJust one of those interesting living habits you notice about others when you live with them.",
            "Old incandescents also put off a ton a heat... Fine if you're heating your house already, if it's summer time and the AC is going, you're also paying extra to cool the house down.",
            "Exactly. LEDs cost pennies a year to operate. It honestly kind of blows my mind how insanely cheap it is to have a well-lit house! And then on top of the cheap electricity, the bulbs themselves last *decades*. You could expect to replace incandescent bulbs yearly or so (depending on how unlucky you were).\n\nI have smart lights in most fixtures now, with routines to turn them off at certain times (midnight, 9:00 am) and I still will habitually turn them off when I leave some rooms (bathroom, kitchen).\n\nI\u2019ll leave lights in bedrooms and sitting rooms on at night during waking hours because I like the ambience and it\u2019s also a security measure. This isn\u2019t an area that has many break-ins, but it still doesn\u2019t hurt to make it obvious people are home.",
            "A couple of years ago my former spouse got on my case for leaving the lights on. I calculated that if I left all the lights on in the house 24hrs a day the incremental cost would be around $25/yr. She stopped bugging me about it. \n\nBut I did grow up with making sure the lights were turned off!!",
            "Discussions like these always remind me of a passage in Matt Ridley's 2010 book, *The Rational Optimist*:\n\n> Ask how much artificial light you can earn with an hour of work at the average wage. The amount has increased from twenty-four lumen-hours in 1750 BC (sesame oil lamp) to 186 in 1800 (tallow candle) to 4,400 in 1880 (kerosene lamp) to 531,000 in 1950 (incandescent light bulb) to 8.4 million lumen-hours today (compact fluorescent bulb). Put it another way, an hour of work today earns you 300 days\u2019 worth of reading light; an hour of work in 1800 earned you ten minutes of reading light.  \nOr turn it round and ask how long you would have to work to earn an hour of reading light \u2013 say, the light of an 18-watt compact-fluorescent light bulb burning for an hour. Today it will have cost you less than half a second of your working time if you are on the average wage: half a second of work for an hour of light. In 1950, with a conventional filament lamp and the then wage, you would have had to work for eight seconds to get the same amount of light. Had you been using a kerosene lamp in the 1880s, you would have had to work for about fifteen minutes to get the same amount of light. A tallow candle in the 1800s: over six hours\u2019 work. And to get that much light from a sesame-oil lamp in Babylon in 1750 BC would have cost you more than fifty hours\u2019 of work. From six hours to half a second \u2013 a 43,200-fold improvement \u2013 for an hour of lighting: that is how much better off you are than your ancestor was in 1800, using the currency that counts, your time. \n\n> Much of this improvement is not included in the cost-of-living calculations, which struggle to compare like with unlike. The economist Don Boudreaux imagined the average American time-travelling back to 1967 with his modern income. He might be the richest person in town, but no amount of money could buy him the delights of eBay, Amazon, Starbucks, Wal-Mart, Prozac, Google or BlackBerry. The lighting numbers cited above do not even take into account the greater convenience and cleanliness of modern electric light compared with candles or kerosene \u2013 its simple switching, its lack of smoke, smell and flicker, its lesser fire hazard. Nor is the improvement in lighting finished yet. Compact fluorescent bulbs may be three times as efficient as filament bulbs in turning electrons\u2019 energy into photons\u2019 energy, but light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are rapidly overtaking them (as of this writing LEDs with ten times the efficiency of incandescent bulbs have been demonstrated) and have the added benefit of working at a portable scale. A cheap LED flashlight, powered by a solar-charged battery, will surely soon transform the life of some of the 1.6 billion people who do not have mains electricity, African peasants prominent among them. Admittedly, LEDs are still far too expensive to replace most light bulbs, but that might change.",
            "Growing up in California, the rule in some houses was, \"If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown, flush it down. I could never quite get into that.",

            "I'm the opposite. Being an adult and paying the electric bill, I realize how little it matters. I'm not going to stress out about the light that's on in the other room, or the $0.01 that it's going to add to my electric bill. Modern lightbulbs use very little power.",
            "I'm like your wife. It was a rule fir me growing up, but now I always forget. Even worse I like bright lighting, so I turn on all the lights. And I constantly hear, \"Why do you have all these lights on?\"\u00a0",

            "My dad always used to say to me \"turn off the dam lights, I don't work for the power company.\"\n\nOnce when I was a kid, I replied \"well why don't you get a job with them?\" After he got through smacking the shit out of me, I started to turn off the lights when I leave a room. Still do 55 years later.",

The idea of *leaving the sink on* while brushing teeth was an anathema to me! I'm from the relatively eco friendly PNW, so I know that's part of the culture shock, but I remember watching Sesame Street segments about turning off the water back in the 1980s, and I know PBS existed even in the south. \n\nIt's been 20 years, and that still sticks in my mind as one of my biggest culture shock moments.",
            "People I live with are constantly turning off lights that I\u2019m using.",
            "When I moved into my house every light was a fucking 150w incandescent bulb. I had to buy LEDs for the whole house. I have an electric space heater that can get my basement uncomfortably warm in the winter that puts out 1.5kW. That basement had 14 of those bulbs. I imagine they didn't use a ton of heat in the winter but I don't know how they didn't have the AC running 24/7 in the summer.",
            "Like you said though.  Light bulbs use 1/10th the power now. For what lighting cost in power you could light 10 homes.",
            "Same. My mom always bitched about me having all the lights on and I always shrugged. I've never had good eyesight and not having all the lights on makes me feel like I'm squinting.",

            "When someone says don\u2019t turn the heat on they mean don\u2019t turn it up past about 68 degrees Fahrenheit. And pipes freezing has to do with water not running, not the air temperature in a house.",

            "This is a small one but it's funny to me. \n\nBack in the 60s-70s, there was a plan to build a beltline/ring highway that would connect at two ends with the interstate that runs to our east. North and west of town were still pretty rural so there was plenty of room to build this out. But the south side of town was already very developed, as well as being very hilly. They built the north and west parts but eventually the project was halted and there is no southern arm to connect back to the interstate. This is a small part of Oregon's history of blocking highway projects before that was fashionable to do.\n\nThey had already built a bit of highway in the south leading from the interstate to the southeastern edge of town, in anticipation of connecting to a grand old freeway that would have obliterated what is today the most desirable neighborhood to live in. The community college campus is only accessible from this stub of highway. So anytime anybody needs to go from anywhere in town to the community college, the last part of the trip involves being on this bizarre freeway that just materializes out of a city street. There's even an exit, halfway to the college, onto a street that was meant to connect to another neighborhood but was never finished, so the exit is basically just there for show and it has its own little stub of road, with some houses, leading nowhere.  \n\nThere is almost never enough traffic to suggest why this street would even have more than two lanes, let alone have been converted to an actual freeway. People who move here without knowing the history assume it was some kind of scam related to the community college, when in fact there is this whole elaborate story behind it. \n\nAnyway, as I type this long story, I reflect on how my region is sort of blissfully free of actual substantial boondoggles. We made a decision to \"mall-ify\" our downtown in the 60s and then had to undo it in the 2000s, but it wasn't *necessarily* a bad idea at the time. We have had conflict over building out more bus lines, but I certainly wouldn't call our pretty good transit system a \"waste of money.\" We have also had conflict over building a new city hall but as frustrating as that process was, there were no actual \"boondoggles\" involved. I am willing to give my city some grace when considering how much money we spend on services and temporary fixes for people who are homeless; those people are not going anywhere. The local University spends a TON of $ on shit that I think is stupid, but who am I to tell them they are wasting their donors' money? The donors seem thrilled!",

That company is now sanctioned and is not allowed to take any new orders in the US, though they are allowed to finish existing orders. Part of the reason for that was they skirted the requirements for certain federal incentives by almost fully building the cars in China and then just adding finishing touches at the new factory here. \n\nSo they don\u2019t give a shit about our order and quality control has been total shit.

NASA hates the damn thing and has been slowly cutting the number of launches back to speed up the program, it\u2019s something like 6 right now.\n\nBasically, the program involves three types of things getting to the moon: the crew capsule Orion, the lander, and modules for the Lunar Gateway space station. Originally everything was going to use the SLS, but as previously mentioned NASA has been moving module launches off of SLS and onto commercial vehicles, so now only Orion uses it. \n\nThen there\u2019s the lander. NASA picked Starship, which is a good choice considering it\u2019s already being made. But unlike smaller landers, Starship will be fully capable of taking people to the moon itself. Even if it doesn\u2019t get certified to launch people, they can go up on Dragon then dock with Starship and fly to the moon. \n\nWhich begs the question, if the entire program depends on a lander that can take people to the moon, what the hell are Orion and SLS for??\n\nGranted they are selecting another lander, but still it\u2019s not really worth SLS\u2019 price tag to keep it around.",

It was designed to to only last a few years before coming down. The county insisted that because of the extra vehicular traffic going down the rural road, that they needed to widen the road. The company building the incinerator said that they would not need a wider road. The county still went ahead and widened the road. The land that the county would need to buy was purchased by a former county commissioner about a year prior. \n\nAt my father's same job, there was a time when the engineers designing the plant were getting overworked so they asked if they could hire somebody to do the administrative paperwork. This would allow the engineers to focus on the engineering work.  Instead, his company hired another engineer to handle both engineering and paperwork. An engineer's salary was about 3 times the salary of what a secretary would have been paid. The reason for this was so that the company contracted by the federal government to build the facility could charge the federal government more. \n\nAt my father's project again, one day he asked me if I wanted an office chair for free. It turns out that his company had bought some office furniture that was not up to government standards.

Nobody would have gotten their finger stuck in it unless they literally were lying on the ground and purposely out their finger in there.

Both cost the same \n- yes, only open during the summer, probably from Memorial Day to Labor Day \n- my mother belongs to a private pool club, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lifeguard there unless it\u2019s a \u201ckid day,\u201d and kid day means my mother won\u2019t be there because why tf do you go to a pool on kids day, gross",
            "When I was a kid in San Francisco, I went swimming in indoor public pools pretty often. Going on vacation and getting to swim in hotel pools outdoors felt extremely fancy (even if it was at like, Motel 6).\n\n\nI was still a kid when we moved to the suburbs (in the Bay Area) and the city pool was outdoors. It was super cool, I went a bunch of times every summer with friends.\n\n\nThere were lifeguards. They did not have \"adult swim\" but they had lap swim that looked very boring to me as a kid.\u00a0",
            "Iowa, we went to a public pool. I lived in a town of like roughly 6,000 people so relatively small. My mom was an in home babysitter which meant that every summer a lot of school aged kids that weren\u2019t usually at our house would be at our house. My mom desperately needed the older kids to be quiet when the younger kids took naps, enter the public pool. Every day for the summer my two brothers, any daycare kid above like 8 who had parents permission, and I would walk the 10 minutes to the public pool and swim for 2 hours while the young kids napped. Both my brothers ended up being lifeguards there when they were teens too.",
            "We mostly went to lakes to swim. Sometimes beaches with lifeguards sometimes no lifeguards. We had a small above ground pool in the backyard when I was young and went to a family friend's inground pool when I was older. Public pool was only a couple of times. The lakes were and still are the best.  Never really encountered the adult swim thing until fairly recently at a private pool club our friends in Maryland belong to.",
            "I grew up in a mobile home in southern California until I was 8. I believe there was a pool there, I have vague memories of being there. We moved to a cookie cutter single family house at that point. A well off neighbor here and there had a pool. One of my childhood friends down the street had an above ground setup. We had a kiddie pool at best.",
            "We had a city pool that had lifeguards. It closed down about 10 years ago. \n\nIn the 80s my family joined a fraternal org pool club so we could go to a slightly nicer/smaller pool. Also with lifeguards. They took out the pool sometime in the 2000s. \n\nThere was also the 100+ year old YMCA indoor pool where my school did swim lessons. The historical building was converted to offices somehow. \n\nCurrently the only pools in my town are at the new YMCA and the pool and tennis club which is marginally nicer than the old city pool. I assume they have lifeguards; I\u2019ve never been.",
            "My family belonged to a private swim and tennis club. It was less fancy than a country club but more upscale than a public pool. We all got free membership because my mom was the head tennis pro there. I spent so many summer days there as a kid and I really miss it.",
            "We had an in ground pool and so did the neighbor that was my age across the street. My parents had it put in when I was 4. I was scared of it at first. That first summer I spent the entire time in my floaties going all the way around the pool clinging to the sides of it. The hot cement ground around it caused my hands to stay inflamed and blistered. One day, my mom made fun of me bc the neighbor my age that also had a pool could swim really well. It hurt my feelings, and when I was crying about to it to my brother he told me air is always moving in and out of our lungs. He said it made us buoyant. I didn\u2019t know what that meant, so I asked him. He said, \u201cyou\u2019ll float if you don\u2019t struggle, idiot.\u201d The next day, I remember being scared, but also wanting to test his theory. I wanted to know if I would float, so I just let go. I ended up becoming a pretty decent swimmer. \n\nPublic pools never did appeal to me because they used so much chlorine. I hated the smell and it turned my blonde hair green enough swimming in my own pool. And then there was a bad accident at our city\u2019s pool where my friend\u2019s brother fell off the high dive. They shut it down after that. He lived, but had a traumatic brain injury. He had to wear a helmet for a year after that.",
            "We had a couple different options...\n\nOption 1: We always got a family pass to the pool at the local park.  \n\nThey had a kiddy pool with a 1 and 2 foot section.  And then the bigger pool had a 4 foot section that you mostly just stood around in, tried to stand on the foam kick boards if you could get your hands on one etc.  the 7 foot section was set up to do laps in.  And then it dropped down to an 11 foot section that they had bisected.  Half was for the diving board and the other half was free dive / swimming.\n\nThey also had a snack stamd.  My go to order was a slush puppy, a semi-frozen Whatchamacallit bar and a slice of pizza.  It was one of those square pizzas they'd take out of the freezer and cook in a toaster oven for a minute or two...\n\nWe did swim lessons here in the morning over the summer...  I remember it always being cold when we first jumped into the water.  \n\nOnce I got into high school I started volunteering at the park helping with various summer camps they'd host.  As \"payment\" if you logged 20 hours you'd get a free pool pass.  \n\nOption 2:  There's a state Park 20min or so from home with a couple beach areas.  We'd take a blanket, a couple pails and go out for the afternoon.  There was an ice cream shack we'd stop at on the way home for a cone or hot fudge sundae or whatever.  We found another place that did fried perogies we'd stop at occasionally for \"lunch\" as well.\n\nThey had a kid play area jungle gym off to one end of the beach we went to most often.  They had a cider block building that houses a snack shop at the front facing the beach.  I don't remember what kind of food they had.  And then they had a changing room to either side...  The guys side had half dozen or so shower stalls & a few rows of benches.  There was no roof over it and no curtains for the showers.  Still remember walking in and seeing a random old guy showering naked...  And thinking how it was kinda odd to be basically outside and naked as I'd swap my suit out for dry clothes...\n\nFor a few years we'd rent a cabin up at the park for a week.  And then just ride our bikes from the cabin down to the beach, spend the morning there, come back for lunch, go back to the beach until dinner...\n\nOption 3:\n\nI don't remember if they were open during the summer...  But we lived like 10min from a college that had a pool.  They'd have it open to the public certain times in the evening and weekends.  \n\nWe switched to taking lessons here...  Can't recall why, if it was cheaper?  Better instructors?  Or maybe it was just cause they did it year round (inside pool).  So we could progress faster without the long break in between...\n\n\nUnfortunately the park got rid of their pool.  They discovered it needed too much repair work.  There were several \"save the pool\" fundraisers but apparently they never raised enough.  It sat empty for a year or two and has since been filled in.  Just the changing room & snack stand still exist.\n\nThe college got rid of theirs to.  Filled it in and last time I poked my head in, it was covered with wrestling mats.  \n\nThe beach still exists.  But they don't do anything there.  No life guards.  The snack stand has been boarded up for awhile...  And I think they walked the entrances to the changing rooms the last time I was there...",
            "When I was under age 7, I swam at a pool run by Easter Seals.  Arguably, it was supposed to be therapy, but it was just fun for me.  I also sometimes visited one of my aunts, who had an in-ground pool.  I swam there numerous times.\n\n  \nThe next 10 years, we had a house with an in-ground pool, and I spent as much time in it as possible.  After my parents' divorce, we moved back to California from Alabama.  Since then, I've gone to the beach a couple times, but that's it.  I haven't had a swimsuit that fits in about 20 years.",

            "I lifeguarded at a public pool for 5 summers as a high schooler into college. It was a huge outdoor pool owned by the local town, and I believe it cost $3 for adults and $2.5 for kids to get in for the day. It was only open in the summer due to lifeguard availability and the warm season.\n\nWe had adult swim! Only on hot days when it was super busy. Every hour on the top of the hour, the lifeguards on duty would blow their whistles and yell ADULT SWIM. Anyone under 18 had to get out of the water, no sitting on edge and dangling their feet. Usually they\u2019d all run to the concession stand to buy snacks. The older people would drift into the pool and get 15 minutes of peace until the mayhem returned when the lifeguards blew their whistles. \n\nI remember using the megaphone and reminding all the kids, WHEN I BLOW THE WHISTLE ADULT SWIM IS OVER. CHILDREN MAY WALK, AND I MEAN WALK, BACK TO THE POOL. NO RUNNING!\n\nSuch a fun job!",

And family trips to the Jersey shore and the like.\n\nBut the surrounded by wealth part meant friends of myself or my parents would have nice indoor pools and we had plenty of pool parties or just days at a friends house. \n\nAdd some YMCA indoor pool for swim lessons for a few years also.",

            "Southern delicacy, usually put in a warm salt water mixture.  You\u2019ll find them at roadside locations and at select gas stations across the South.  \n\nThey\u2019re delicious, but note that it can make your hands a little sticky, and a little messy (at least in terms of the shells and getting the wetness on your hands) and you\u2019ll smell that salt water mixture for a hot second.",
            "They are good, only if they are got from a dude at a roadside stand or a place that sells local fruits, veggies and honey",
            "Surprisingly good!   \nDon\u2019t eat the shells or actual southerners will laugh at you.",
            "I\u2019m allergic to peanuts, so probably shouldn\u2019t be weighing in here.\u00a0\n\nBut, just like many southern foods, I think I trust the rando on the roadside more than the kettle at the convenience store.\u00a0",
            "They are delicious! Salty and kind of soft, but with a firm bite. They're often sold at roadside stands here. You can also find them canned but I've never tried that.",
            "My ex-husband made the best ever. He was a chef. Wouldn't ever give me the recipe. There was beer involved. Never being able to have them again is truly one of the only things I regret about my divorce.",
            "Never had them",
            "They're really good when done right. They're somewhat salty. You don't want to eat the shell. It's a southern delicacy.",
            "these were one of the items of culture shock i experienced on my first road trip around the south with my ex. boiled peanuts i had straight up also never heard of, but at least they\u2019re easy to figure out. peanuts, boiled. the other sign i saw was for tomato pie and i was like \u201cso, pizza????\u201d. absolute trip.",

            "The best place to get em is on the side of country roads in the deep south. The Boiled Peanuts that come in a can and are re-heated on the stove are hot garbage.\n\nLook for a old man with a tarp tent in the middle of nowhere with a hand-painted sign reading \"Boiled P-Nuts\" and tell him you're lookin for some goober peas, thats your ticket",
            "We would always get them at a road-side stand in South Carolina while driving to Myrtle Beach. I don't think anyone in the family really loved them but it was more of a tradition. The peaches were always the best.\n\nThere's a guy at work who will make them on occasion and I'll have a few but they aren't something I'd ever miss.",

            "A fukin delicacy. Good shit \ud83d\udc4c\n\nThey're boiled in shell with a lot of salt. The fats and protein make the peanut slimy which is the main complaint I hear but imo its good. Avocados are slimy too",
            "I know that they are beloved by some Southerners\u2026 and also that it sounds like \u201cbowled peenus\u201d with a strong accent. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve actually tried them, though.",

            "I have hated all things peanut ALL MY LIFE. No PBJs, ever. I had the pleasure of going to DAKAR in New Orleans and they served boiled peanuts which I was not going to eat but since my friend kept saying it tastes nothing like a peanut and it's amazing, I decided to just go for it. And yes. They're amazing. They don't taste anything like roasted peanuts. So soft and chewy a lil smoky from some paprika. A lil salty. They're delightful!!",
            "Excellent as long as they're not too mushy. Synonymous with summer in the South",

            "Oh those are how you know you crossed the border of North Carolina to South Carolina \ud83d\ude09\u00a0\n\nMy husband is from South Carolina. He has explained in the past that the pull over on the side of the road boiled peanuts are the best ones. They come in plain or seasoned, and boiled with the shell on\u2026 When I have tried them, it tasted like slightly less peanuty and slightly more bean-y.\u00a0",
            "Do you mean boiled P-Nuts?\nIf so, the gas station ones are pretty good but the dudes selling them on the side of the road do it right. Always get you a little regular and a little spicy and you'll be alright.",
            "I get boiled peanuts once or twice year at a local produce market. They taste like salt, summer, and nostalgia.",
            "I ate boiled peanuts a handful of times when I lived in The South. They\u2019re really excellent. Try them.\n\nBoiled peanuts are peanuts that are boiled. Make sure to deshell them.",
            "I can only tell you that they're nasty.",
            "So good. I hate the beer kind.",
            "They typically come in two flavors: plain salt or or spicy cajun seasoning. \n\nAnother way they're eaten (at least where I live) is in a dish called Junk Pot. It's basically anything you go thrown in a pot and boiled. Typical items include turkey or pork neck bones, ribs, corn on the cob, boiled peanuts still in the shell, sausages, garlic, potatoes, onion, and sometimes seafood like crabs, crawfish, or shrimp. Among other things. It's eaten with your hands and I never seen the same combo twice. It's best buttery and spicy in the rich broth it makes as it's cooked",
            "They\u2019re terrific! I was raised on the canned ones but I\u2019ve learned how to boil them myself. 1 1/2 lbs of raw/green peanuts, 1/3 cup of salt, and water. Add all ingredients to a crockpot and cook on high for 6-7 hours, stirring occasionally. I rinse mine after taking them out of the crockpot to remove the excess salt. They\u2019re great when they\u2019re warm!\nI\u2019m an Atlanta native and live in Texas now, and have had a hard time finding any to boil myself, and I really miss them.",
            "I had them and thought they were nasty. Just mush. Now fried Virginia peanuts, that's where its at!",

            "Might be more widespread now but growing up I understood it as a southern thing. I think they're gross, my mom loves them. Occasionally you can find them in cans out here in AZ and she'll buy them and I gag.\n\nThey're just.... Shell-on peanuts that have been boiled and seasoned. Since they're soft you just gotta suck them out of the shell. Textural hell if you ask me but plenty of people love them",

            "What more do you want to know?",
            "This will get me my NC card revoked, but they are absolutely disgusting",
            "I think they are an acquired taste for some people. my husband is a picky eater because of texture stuff, so he doesn\u2019t like boiled peanuts. he likes raw peanuts and peanut butter, and peanut butter flavored stuff, and even peanuts in Chinese food. but because those are  hard and crunchy and boiled peanuts are soft, the texture gets to him and he doesn't like them.  like he associates peanuts with being crunchy so the softness of the boiled peanuts doesn't compute.",
            "Next time you\u2019re in an area that sells boiled peanuts, pay attention to the dental work and you\u2019ll understand why people eat their peanuts soft.",

            "Only southerners eat these things. They would be considered very weird up north. I\u2019ve only seen them down south but they\u2019re in all the gas stations.\u00a0",
            "The first time my wife had them she said \"I could see if you grew up eating these I could see why you might like them\".\n\nFrankly I think they are an abomination",
            "I'm sure they taste fine, but they smell awful",
            "Moved to SC and had never seen them til then. It\u2019s salty mush, I think you have to eat them growing up to gain an appeal for them.",

            "Sounds fucking disgusting",
            "They are mushy and gross and honestly we don't know what the fuck is wrong with Alabama and Mississippi.  They manage to wreck perfectly good peanuts.",
            "I would like to know more",
            "There is a place near my family that the farmers sell their produce, honey and boiled peanuts. Not a farmers market but like a store type of deal and they are amazing",
            "There used to be a gas station near where I spent some time growing up. It's been closed since I think '02 but best boiled peanuts you've ever had.",
            "Damn right he is!",
            "Also a Chinese delicacy, produced almost exactly the same way.\u00a0\n\nThe first time I went to China, I visited a family friend who tried to surprise me with two delicacies that Americans supposedly didn\u2019t like.\u00a0\n\nThey were boiled peanuts and spicy crawfish, so naturally, my Texan ass was in hog heaven\u00a0",
            "Cajun seasoned are the best.",
            "I had some that were boiled in a spicy mixture like we would use for boiling crawfish or shrimp.  They were fantastic, salty and spicy and more addictive than a good batch of tortilla-chips or popcorn could ever hope to be.",
            "\\*made in a warm saltwater mixture, not really \"put\".\u00a0\n\nBut yes, delicious!\u00a0\n\nBest when bought on the side of the road from a man also selling watermelons.\u00a0\n\nOr made at home!\u00a0",

            "Sucking them out just right is the key to keeping less of it on your hands. Although my husband just sits across from me making jokes about it (at least they\u2019re complementary, lol).",
            "Or made in a massive pot in some chunky fella's yard",
            "You can eat them though! Sometimes we cook them until the shell is soft enough to eat too. The only part left is the little fibers in the shell that don't break down",
            "Apparently some recent studies have found that boiled peanuts are mostly hypoallergenic (the proteins that cause allergic reactions get denatured) and can possibly be used to desensitize people allergic to peanuts. Probably not a good idea to test it out on your own, but it\u2019s definitely interesting.",
            "Cans are okay, but I would say very good. You could probably doctor it up by reboiling them with seasoning. My mom buys them sometimes when they're out of season",
            "Some select gas stations are starting to carry them in Ohio. I've seen them a couple of times around. They are canned, but they aren't too bad.",

            "Welp - this made me cackle. Bowled is accurate. Peenus sent me and now I gotta rethink how I say peanuts.",

Watermelon in the NE doesn't compare",

Miss that place......",
            "> Viet-Cajun type\n\nI do my own boiled peanuts, but have never had this variation.  My Google-Fu must be lacking here, as I can't find any \"Vietnamese\" recipe that has other than salt.  Any clue as to the spices used?",
