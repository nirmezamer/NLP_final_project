A brand new Fender Mustang today costs like what 2k euro ish, a brand new Martin costs 3k but it not only was on one of the most iconic live performances of all time also had some customisation that Kurt probably asked for. That guitar is 1 of 1 really. The Mustang that he bought is basically the equivalent of \"Steve Jobs used to get his coffee here\" vs the Martin \"This is Steve Jobs' belt from the time he announced the iPhone and it was made for him by Dior\". In a way the Martin is priceless but the Mustang is definitely a great collectors item but nothing more, the fact it went for 4.5m was overpriced IMO, that's more expensive than Clapton's favourite Strat that he toured with constantly and recorded his albums with.",

I do well in life. I make no excuses for anything. I failed as a husband and father myself, although that was long ago now and before I understand what I do now. Just for context.\n\nOne thing: he used to call me a master manipulator when I was a kid. And now i agree, I was. I had no choice. I was 9 when he molested me for a period of time. I lived with it. Said nothing to anyone. I was old enough to know that what my little brother and I had as a family would get torn apart. So I did become a liar.
