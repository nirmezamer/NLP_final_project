            "You get used to them. But unless it\u2019s a big tiger, blue or white shark I wouldn\u2019t consider them dangerous if you know what you are doing. Lemon sharks are also a little nutty and unpredictable sometimes even though they are usually docile. The biggest thing is to dispatch the fish you have on the end of the line as quickly as possible. The struggling injured fish in the water is what really activates the sharks prey drive. Most sharks are just curious and will come up to you but if you push them away or give them a gentle poke with the end of your spear they will leave you alone. This has been my experience as saltwater fishing and free diving has been my primary hobby for the last 25 years.",
            "if sharks and crocodiles wouldnt taste like chewy wet chicken, the world would be a saver place :P",
            "you can just scroll if you don't want it. thanks.",
            "Yeah but they're made up mostly of cartilage, super tough, like being made out of rubber coated with sandpaper, in feeding frenzies they often bite each other etc - or when feeding among razor-sharp corals etc - this won't cause lasting damage.",
            "Yeah he did not seem very perturbed",
            "What\u2019s up with the chunk out of the tuna where the spear went in?",
            "That's a lot of words for I don't like eating shark or crocodile.\nI love shark and crocodile! They are delicious!",
            "Yeah, I usually act more concerned when trying to prevent my bunny from stealing food off my plate",
            "A spear went in.",
            "It wasn\u2019t the best spear shot. The perfect shot is the \u201cstone shot\u201d where you hit the brain or central nervous system and the fish dies instantly and doesn\u2019t struggle. There is nothing worse than missing a fish and your spear tears out and the fish escape and you left a wounded fish there for no reason. It\u2019s why if a shot doesn\u2019t feel very good I won\u2019t take it. In this video he made a good shot in terms of holding power but the spear went through a good chunk of meat damaging it. Tuna are incredibly powerful swimmers so this one started tearing its own flank apart trying to escape. This diver would have retrieved and dispatched this fish sooner but was also busy fending the sharks away so it\u2019s understandable. You can see at the end of the video he tosses his dive knife on the deck. He probably had it pulled out to brain the fish once he had control of it.",
            "i mean its a blank canvas with not so great texture. they taste mainly like whatever you do with them. totally eatable but absolutely loses to e.g. salmon or steak IMO.",
            "I wasn\u2019t asking you.",
            "So for the chunk to come out on what I assume is the entry side, is that just how fish flesh like that reacts to a spear gun? \n\nIf I shoot an animal it generally won\u2019t take a chunk like that  out the entry side. \n\nOr is the spear pulling it out?",
            "You can see him stab the shark multiple times",
            "Actually towards the end of the video he stabs both sharks",
            "Have you ever had a pan-seared shark steak? It's sooo good!\n\nAnd smoked crocodile! Also very good!",
            "But, a spear went in",
            "It\u2019s the tearing of the spear as the fish fights against the metal shaft. Basically think about stabbing a piece of rebar through a Mellon and then wagging the piece of metal back and forth; it\u2019s going to wallow out and make a much larger entry hole than the initial spear diameter",
            "Yes, my point is he would have initially unsheathed it to brain his tuna",
            "And when you shoot an animal you don\u2019t get a chunk taken out the entry like that, so neither of you have offered any insight. \n\nI was hoping for an actual explanation from someone that actually knows something.",
            "Yeah ok that\u2019s makes sense, cheers for that, you\u2019ve been much more helpful that these other dicks in the comments, that\u2019s why I asked you in the first place as you seem to know what you\u2019re talking about out. \n\nIt happened so quickly I thought it was from the impact itself.",
            "Spear is shifting back and forth in the flesh and has ripped open the wound. Stop acting like a cunt",
            "Spear goes in, stays in. Wriggle, wriggle, comes back out, goes back in, wriggle, wriggle, back out, back in \u2026 and the hole slowly expands. \n\nSounds familiar right?",
            "If you smell shit everywhere you go, make sure to look under your own shoe."

            "I hate that fucking voice so much",
            "Power idle (don't want to hit the Earth faster)\n\nAilerons neutral (control surface is effectively useless)\n\nRudder full and opposite (stop the spinning)\n\nElevator forward (break the stall)\n\nPARE acronym was hammered into us for spin training! Fun stuff, not as disorienting as you'd think as you're mostly looking at your instrument panel.",
            "The flight school near where I lived had a bunch of planes with bad door latches and apparently the doors who blow open occasionally during spin recovery practice. \u00a0Apparently the combination of being strapped in and the centrifugal force pushing you into the seat meant the students were perfectly safe but I imagine the shock added a lot of the stress of learning. \u00a0I only heard about it second hand from a few students I was friends with. \u00a0No way I\u2019d want to experience it first hand.",
            "In most planes then passenger seat is also equipped to fly as well",
            "No override per se, but there is controls on both sides. I said in another comment this kind of training is done very late on, so hopefully by this point there shouldn\u2019t be the issue of the student freezing up, and also that by then the phrase \u201cI have control\u201d should be enough of a trigger to just let go of the controls. \n\nIf that doesn\u2019t work then, genuinely, a swift whack to the students face will be enough to break them out of the meltdown. Sucks. But it\u2019s better than dying.",
            "Haha yeah I imagine that would certainly add an extra dimension \ud83d\ude02. Thankfully like yourself I never experienced that first hand!!"
