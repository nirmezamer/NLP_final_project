            "Awesome, DM me please. I will connect with you the founder. We are launching the first version of this tool mid next month.",
            "Wooh, wish you all the best. I definitely hope you achieve your goals. Would love to have a talk about your product as what are you building. Can I DM you?",
            "Thanks a lot, definitely would love to have a talk! DM me please.",
            "Thanks a lot, yeah building apps with React is definitely a good choice.",
            "Haha, yeah! Thanks a lot :)",
            "There are failures in this journey when I started:\n1. I launched with subscription based pricing model, but got feedback it won\u2019t work so moved go  project quote model\n2. Got a lot of backslash for the website copywriting as it was poor in the beginning so hired a copywriter to write everything \n3. Had some of the clients like 2 as of now who took the complete project plan but ghosted at the end\n4. And yeah a few more mistakes like hiring a outbound lead generation specialist, turns out to be that it has no outcome and the work is like a blackbox as no idea of what going on there",
            "Haha yeah for now, but a long way ahead still.",
            "Cool, how its going for you?\nYeah you can do in a mix of equity and cash, but yeah to be very selective about the projects you take for work.",
            "Thanks for this advice, I haven't thought of this, but yeah, let me think if I can make time commitments and have people get fractional CTOs for their companies.",
            "Thanks a lot!",
            "Thanks a lot :)",
            "Thanks a lot!",
            "Thanks a lot for your wishes!",
            "We don\u2019t take stocks for now, just complete cash!",
            "I was not having a portfolio of projects for myself but yeah my LinkedIn profile was good enough yo build a bit of starting trust. And than they started with a small work of landing page, we shipped it perfectly and than it went to finalize the whole project with us.",
            "Definitely we have quite good expertise in React, as our main tech stack for the frontend side is React. Will DM you to discuss more!",
            "Thanks for your offer, though currently I am not looking for investment but let\u2019s talk I can connect with you with some of the interested founders.",
            "Thanks a lot, that\u2019s great to hear! I hope you are kicking off great on the project side as a freelancer and love the flexibility of work there.\n\nYeah definitely let\u2019s talk, we can do some mutual partnership, as we have a team to work on the complete project so you can contribute to the same too as what would work BEST for you, rest with other stuffs we can help them.",
            "Thanks a lot, yeah it\u2019s definitely a lot of fun to work with founders to build their ideas to life, as there are a lot of things which comes along the way like product research, features analysis and crafting a plan for perfect MVP for them.",
            "Thanks a lot, yeah being consistent and having patience paid off at the end!",
            "How much did you charge for landing page for the 1st customer & how long did it take? Not sure if you want it to be secret.",
            "I am curious. Funding your design team or maybe even other workers, did you save up enough to pay them or did you have some partnership with a few friends in the field and worked out a deal on that? The projects sound a lot of fun!",
            "Figma Balls",
            "How much was your initial investment? Do you have a website?",
            "Would love to have a talk with you to discuss more about what you are planning to build!",
            "Thinking of specializing in a niche, or keeping it broad?",
            "How do you differentiate yourself from other tech agencies out there?",
            "15k for the full app? Not bad. I've been having trouble finding these kinds of clients. Where are you getting them from?",
            "What company hired you?",
            "I'm going for my masters in cs in the usa, but I've always been interested in starting something of my own. Also I'm very much interested in the hotel industry. One person can like two different things right \ud83d\ude05.",
            "Hi, congratulations, excited to hear more. Why did you move away from the subscription model? And do you now charge an upfront portion to cover the ghosting?",
            "It\u2019s all small victories with a few big highlights",
            "The funny thing is, I\u2019m pretty sure I know who you made your second sale to.  Was it somebody from this forum from earlier? If it is, I hope you address any hardware problems he might have.",
            "Ok, I made about $150k off one that got acquired plus the upfront cash of $15k and only did about 5-7 days hands on code. That was quite good. Others I\u2019ve yet to see pay off but I\u2019ve only done 3 that way. \n\nI was previously a founder/ceo of a deeptech start up that got acquired so I do this part time to keep busy.",
            "Nice, thanks! I\u2019d love to connect on LinkedIn, shoot me a DM",
            ">We do have a testimonial from our first client, here it is \u201cDeepak, the founder of LeanMVP, has played a key role in moving our project forward. I came across Deepak online and we decided to discuss my goals. Initially hesitant, I soon learned to trust Deepak and his capabilities. I was impressed with his skills, organization, and insightful suggestions. He always knew exactly what needed to be done and how to do it. His organizational skills and delivery quality are exceptional\u2014he's always quick to respond and willing to hop on calls to get things right. Our software is still in development, but I will update this with further information soon.\u201d\n\nWe charged $1000-$1500 for a landing page which includes design and development both, which has an inbuilt form for early waitlist user signup.",
            "Great question! So, here\u2019s the thing that as I am based out of India so dev and designer cost is bit low, and right now I am focused on building my project portfolio so not a quite big profit margin for me, but yeah moving forward this would improve, and the pricing would adjust accordingly a bit.",
            "My initial investment was not a lot, just around $2k till now. Yeah we have a website. You check check us at: https://leanmvp.co/",
            "Right now, we are specialized in a niche as our ICPs are: Non-technical founders who want to build MVP and early-stage startups. \n\nBut I want to get broad once we grow a bit. That's the plan.  Do you run an agency too?",
            "how about creating a market place for all the ai agencies and the clints",
            "The thing is that there\u2019s not a big differentiator with   Tech agencies, only the differentiator can be the quality of services. I work quite closely with all of the founders, as help them with any questions they have to build a successful product.\n\nOur goal is not just to ship a perfect software but to make their product successful in the market.",
            "Why not? Specialization has ruined us. I like everything from software to physics to comedy to movies.\n\nBut that comes its own faults lol. You are always in learning mode then.",
            "Good luck for your masters!\n\nYeah definitely exploring different ideas in your free time is ideal. What sort of business you want to do in hotel industry? Like starting a restaurant, cafes or something else.",
            "Completely agree, small wins to celebrate for sure!",
            "Haha not sure, but it was not from this forum. As he reached out to me in DMs like 2-3 weeks ago, and we discussed the complete project before finalising it.",
            "That's huge, It's good to hear that all the deals were successful, as I think your past experience of being a CEO helps a lot in the project selection.\n\ntalk with you and see if there's a chance of a mutual partnership. We could share the development overhead, and you could be involved in the projects of multiple companies. Can I DM you?",
            "That's very cheap actually. There are just design agencies charging $4-5k/mo & have 1 person doing the whole thing lol.\n\nThey make over $100k/month or something. Idk how they manage that without overworking.",
            "Congrats man. In which subreddit you found your first client?",
            "That is interesting. I was thinking too from reading your post that starting something like an agency for tech or even marketing would require you to ensure you don't overwork yourself so hiring help would be essential eventually. I am not an expert, I'm still someone learning even what it may take to run a business but it does seem like you are on the right track. Build up that case where you are the company for the project someone has to the point where they cannot refuse you because it would be crazy to.",
            "Thank you, also what did you use to create your clients landing page? I am new to this and just trying to put the picture together. Sounds super interesting",
            "No, but i am picking up brains of various agencies founder ; i want to start ai agency ; what advice can you give? i have never done cold email before, does it still work ?",
            "Ideally a restaurant. I love good food.",
            "Who knows, either way good luck.",
            "Thanks for the kind words. I\u2019m actually keen on flying solo for a while. My last start up was U.K./US based and I\u2019m pretty burnt out from it. Now I just work at my own pace!",
            "Yeah we are actually a bit cost effective for founders so budget should not be a blocker for them to start with their product development.",
            "Thanks a lot, I don\u2019t remember the subreddit exactly but I think it was in the SaaS or EntrepreneurRideAlong",
            "So the landing page designs were created by our design team in Figma, and than it was developed in React. We are doing one more updates to landing page soon as to add some of the products dashboard design which would be LIVE soon by early next week.",
            "Got that, AI agency has quite a good market these days based upon the evolution of GenAI. So, if you have experience in that start by buying some products so you have something to showcase to your clients.\n\nI tried cold emails, but till now I haven\u2019t got any successful leads through it. I recently changed my strategy and have planned to launch next batch of cold emails starting next week. Will let you know how that went.",
            "I\u2019m in tech sales and send hundreds of emails per week. I get maybe 1 prospect from emails every 2-3 weeks. Cold calling is king.",
            "Awesome! Even I love good food and exploring new cafes, restaurants and new cuisine around my place.",
            "Thanks again, i hope it would be definitely great if I got some leads from here around to help people looking for the same.",
            "What\u2019s the general format of your cold emails (overall tone, personalization, etc)? Is that a pretty common conversion rate for tech sales cold emails?",
            "\ud83d\ude01",
            "We are told to keep it very short and to the point. Yes you want to personalize the email some and tailor it for the prospect. I don\u2019t know about other organizations but here, email just doesn\u2019t convert like a cold call. I\u2019m emailing directors of IT, CTOs, etc and I imagine they are constantly flooded with emails. Might have better luck with a different type of prospect."

            "I never looked at my adhd as disability. Instead it helped me hyperfocus and connect patterns, calling it disability would be self harm. \n\nAlso as per my observation adhd thrives in chaos and entrepreneurship is all about turning chaos into system.",

After becoming successful as an entrepreneur, I\u2019m actually now in an executive role working for someone else. But, I could have never gotten to the point, I am at now, if I had gone the traditional route.",
            "Is being Neurodivergent a new cool trend in business? I've seen this crop up on LinkedIn recently where people are now describing themselves as 'Neurodivergent Founder' or 'Neurodivergent Entrepreneur'.\n\nWhy is there a need to 'show off', for lack of a better term, that you are neurodivergent?\n\nPersonally the people I have seen do it are screaming out for attention and hoping to raise capital. Maybe they think investors will perceive them as gifted in some way. I think Elon going public with his Aspergers kick started this trend.",

Hyper focus is great but can make things a little sloppy so I always go back and fine tune my plans after the fact",

Look at highly successful individuals - they can be everything but the social norm. Problem of beeing neurodivergent? Why seek problems? Can't being neurodivergent be a real asset?\n\nLike isn't entrepreneurship all about being different? Doing it YOUR way?\n\nLike, let me repeat one more time... Normal is working a 9-5. Entrepreneurship diverges from the social norm.",

Or that I have a lot of trouble with starting and switching between tasks. \n\nI don\u2019t see being neurodivergent as inherently bad and something to use as an excuse at all, but some methods others use don\u2019t work for me and I want to learn from others like me and what they do to achieve success",
