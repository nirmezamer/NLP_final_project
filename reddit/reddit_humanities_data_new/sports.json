            "I tried watching her game to see if she\u2019s being targeted by the media but nope she\u2019s got an awkward, non existent post game and her rebounding prowess seems more from getting her own misses (exaggerating but that\u2019s the impression). Angel Reece might be the exact reason I don\u2019t watch WNBA",
            ">\u00a0\u00a0Angel Reese: People watch WNBA for me too, not just Caitlin Clark.\n\n\n\u00a0Angel Geese: people feed the ducks for me too, not just the ducks",

            "Another example of seeing the only hate comments dissing angel Reese unprovoked, the hypocrisy is hilarious",
            "There was absolutely zero need for you to bring Angel up in this thread. You people are seriously sick. She obviously lives rent free in your head.",
            "She\u2019s honestly sick with it. Have you seen her ball ? You wouldn\u2019t understand",

            "I'm not arguing with you, but having watched most of CC's games it didn't seem like a confidence thing to me.  I think it was more the ability to get some rest and practice and get to know the team after their insane schedule in the first 1/4 of their season.",
            "I hope soon she\u2019ll get confer-table enough to go back to hitting logo threes.",
            "No.  But putting up 30 would also certainly be valuable.",
            "She played for all but the final minute of the 4th\n\nSo, yeah, strange she only took 1 shot in that span",
            "Atlanta usually play in a 3500 seat arena. \u00a0They moved to the nba area and sold out the 17,585. \u00a0Because Caitlin Clark is already a star, not because the media is \u201ctrying to make her a star\u201d.",

            "Yeah, for the most part she was putting up 40 at Iowa because she had to for them to win, but there were plenty of games that I watched where she could've legitimately ended the game with 15-20 assists if her teammates could score. She's very much a complete player offensively and now she's coming into her own in the WNBA after a hectic start to the season.\n\nShe needs to work on turnovers still, but she'll be fine.",
            "She\u2019s the only one to have a 30-point triple double. She just did it with 40 points. \u00a0",
            "She shoots 50% at the rim and 38% from the field. I actually watch women's basketball at times and Angel Reese is unwatchable with a terrible attitude. There are a lot of other players other than Clark that people should see but Reese is not one of them. She's someone that really didn't develop their game and got by by being physically better than people in the lower levels.",
            "I\u2019ve tried watching games to see if we\u2019ve all been ignoring this beautiful game.  Lots of bad and or missed passes. Lots of turnovers.  3\u2019s outside the line are kinda cool.",
            "Yeah I remember back in the day it was cool to see Rodman throw himself across the floor trying to get a rebound but at the end of the day I was watching to see Jordan.",

            "Woah. Look at who's posting. It has nothing to do with the content. I'm sure you're a real person as well. Holy shit.",

            "If you\u2019re being double and triple covered, it\u2019s probably best to dish it off to the open teammate, and let her score.",
            "I\u2019m not trying to glaze CC because she gets enough of that, but this could be just being a good teammate. Lebron has spoken about the importance of getting your teammates involved, not just for the current game, but for the next game as well.",
            "Thanks for the info.  I didn't watch the game so have no idea what happened so I will just leave it at that. :)",
            "Yeah I've watched a bunch of WNBA and frankly it's like watching amateur sports. It's just a bunch of layups and poor shooting for the most part. I have no idea why the women are so against lowering the rim. I've heard their excuse that it would screw up the game, but that's just an adjustment that would need to be made. It is some of the most unwatchable sports I've ever seen. But on the other hand, I'm glad that they are getting a bigger audience and hopefully  make more money",
            "lol ironic because my favorite player as a kid was Rodman before I found out about the off court stuff. The full extension rebound is a poster I used to have on my wall",
            "What was hard for you to understand? He said she\u2019s sick with it. Do you need to know the meaning of that? It\u2019s slang..it means she\u2019s good.. you good now?",
            "Yeah, sharing is caring. \ud83d\ude02",
            "I caught an Aces playoff game last year while I happened to be in Vegas for work. It was horrible to watch. Being there in person and the crowd having fun helped a bit, so I could only imagine trying to watch it in my living room. The league needs to figure something out, because CC mania won't last forever even if she only gets better.",
            "I idolized Rodman. Defensive ball doesn't get any love. Rebounds are important for a reason."

All season when OKC would do interviews they would join Giddey, or have Giddey join them to isolate him from questions about the allegations with the minor.

Doesn\u2019t mean he owes them being a bench player his entire career when he is clearly capable of being a starter and able to develop more on another team with more minutes. I\u2019m sure his team still supports him and his decision. Foh.",

He should go where he is wanted and needed.\n\nPeople here using examples of role players is crazy. This guy is a 21 year old elite prospect. It\u2019s a totally different situation from Naz Reid or Malik Monk or whoever. None of those guys is a early lottery 6\u20198\u201d point guard. It\u2019s a great swing-for-the-fences move for a team that has to rebuild anyway.\n\nAs for fit, fit with what? We don\u2019t know anything about what the Bulls will look like long term. They\u2019re shopping everyone but Colby White!\n\nThis is an elite prospect for elite role player trade which absolutely makes sense because one team is the first seed contender and the other one looks like it\u2019s headed for a rebuild.",

Caruso is an All Defense wing with a good 3 ball and with Dort, SGA and J-Will forms a perimeter defense that could be almost as good (but obviously less consistent) as the Jays, White and Holiday in Boston.\n\nPresti's starting early this offseason.

His strength is play making, passing, and driving but they made him be mostly a spot up shooter which he isn't good at. \n\nHe really just needed a different situation, but now it will be interesting to see what he can do there.",
            "Isn't he problematic in the relationship he had with an underage girl? Whatever happened with that?",
            "I don't think Giddey's ceiling is anywhere close to All-NBA. He can't shoot, particularly off the dribble, and has below-average athleticism. I don't see either of those improving enough to become one of the top 15-20 players in the league. He can be an average to slightly above average starter, but unless his weaknesses improve significantly he will remain a floor-raiser and not someone who can contribute to playoff success.",

On this team he will always have the ball to get to those scorers. That said with Caruso gone we have zero dudes on the roster who can play defense. Should be fun to watch.",
            "Also there's absolutely nothing wrong with that either.",
            "Contract year overrides that. He just wants stats to get paid. I don\u2019t think nearly as many NBA players care about winning as we want to think. If I was on my rookie contract I\u2019d absolutely be playing for \ud83d\udcb0above all else",

It doesn\u2019t matter what the circumstances are. Doesn\u2019t matter what Giddey thought or what he was told. \n\nThat means that the girl involved is a victim of a crime. You\u2019re quite literally victim blaming. I don\u2019t think victim blaming is a good look. \n\nAs a comment above said, because he\u2019s rich and famous, no formal charges, but he\u2019s still guilty in the court of public opinion.",

Brown was never going to be more than a role player or 6th man.\n\nThis guy is a 6\u20198\u201d point guard that has elite vision, and could still develop to handle the glaring holes in his game. He\u2019s only 21.",
