        "content": "Hello again! Apologies for the influx of mod posts recently - we have been making changes to improve the user experience.\n\nThe sub's post flairs have been overhauled today. The list of changes is as follows:\n\n* Headset, HTPC, Miscellaneous, Mouse Pad, Optical Drive, OS, Printer, and Router have been removed due to infrequent use and/or redundancy\n* Flash Drive has been renamed to External Storage to be more broad; this includes external HDDs and SSDs, flash drives, SD / microSD cards, drive enclosures including NAS, etc.\n* Mic has been renamed to Microphone\n* TV has been added separate from Monitor due to high post volume\n\nIf you have any further suggestions for changes to the flair system, feel free to leave a comment on this thread or [send us modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/buildapcsales). \n\nThese changes do affect Reddit's search functionality; any previous posts with the old flairs can still be searched by name. They should be reflected accurately in Discord; if you notice any issues, please let us know.\n\nIn addition, as a result of continued posting of scam listings following [last week's stickied mod post](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/19cohqf/scam_listings_title_formatting/), we are now enforcing this rule with **24 hour bans** for every post in violation. Please refer to the linked post or the stickied comment on marketplace posts on how to determine if a listing on these websites is legitimate or not.",

            "Will the `old.reddit` sidebar be updated with search links for new flairs?",
            "There should be an infraction counter for posting those scam links if such a thing is possible with increasing penalties. This is just my humble opinion, but perhaps it should be a 24-hour ban, 1-week ban (2nd offense), and on as the person posts more malicious links. There are too many people here that have fallen for those scams.",
            "Glad to see no more OS sales. The rules for only mod-approved commenting on OS posts got me scammed out of $40 on Woot, and presumably plenty more people, too. I wasn't even able to get a refund on mine after the key didn't work - they just delayed long enough until I found another way to get a key, and then sent a \"replacement\" key I didn't need and couldn't even try.\n\nMost people see $40 for a Windows key from a site they otherwise trust and flock to upvote it. An actual, fully legit key for that price **would** be a great deal, but you don't find out how scammy it is until they send you a \"tracking number\" that's supposed to be input as your Windows key. Comments were flooded with warnings nobody could see because they required mod approval and each time, it took mods many hours to get around to it. I personally saw that whole thing happen twice, and of course, on the second instance when I knew to warn others, my warning took mods too long to approve so it didn't help.",
            "Is this it Chief?\n\nIn for 4",
            "So does that mean we can no longer post any headset, htpc, miscellaneous, mouse pads, optical drives OS, or printer nor router sales?",
            ">TV has been added separate from Monitor due to high post volume\n\nThank god, TVs are not monitors. Never have been.",
            ">Flash Drive has been renamed to External Storage to be more broad; this includes **external HDDs** and SSDs, flash drives, SD / microSD cards, **drive enclosures including NAS**, etc.\n\nSo is \"HDD\" only for *internal*, no-shuck-needed mechanical HDDs?\n\nIt seems to me that people looking for a spinner would likely want to see all the spinners, internal or otherwise.\n\nAlso, people looking for a portable storage device, flash or otherwise, would probably *not* want to see 3.5\" external HDDs that require a power brick plugged into a wall outlet.\n\nAnd a NAS is an entire computer.",
            "Have flairs disappeared altogether now?  I used to see it on the right navigation pane, but now I can't see them at all.",
            "Can we get a quick rundown on the nonsense that happened with win11 and woot? I\u2019m just stunned that woot \u2014 an Amazon outlet and heretofore reputable company \u2014 was selling bogus keys.",
            "Thanks Chief",
            "Is there a potential for a microcenter tag?",
            "Can we ban $1599 RTX 4090 posts? It's not a deal when it's MSRP and Nvidia regularly has them in stock.",
            "Is it just me, or are all the flair links dead now.",
            "Thanks for your efforts. This is consistently one of the best communities in my Reddit experience and the care and thought that go into the moderation are a huge part of that. Cheers!",
            "Correct me if I'm wrong, but I remember there being a flair for furniture...? I don't see it anymore. Do y'all know where i can find deals for furniture? I.E. Computer chairs.",
            "I tried to make a post warning about a scam site that is appearing in google shopping search results. \n\nI almost got screwed over by them but luckily my payment did not go through. \n\nhttps://malwaretips.com/blogs/saleshopbuy-com/",
            "Where do we go to ask if a sale is a scam or not?",
            "What happened to the flair filter section on the right sidebar? I'm on desktop website and can't find it anywhere on this forum.",
            "lol good thing my **accidental** posting of a no-name seller on Amazon selling a 7900 XTX happened two days ago and not now. \n\nSo easy to see a big price drop via Keepa and rush to post it only to realize it's a Chinese account that just opened a few days ago. \n\nLooks like Amazon took down that scam listing now...or some schmuck bought it and doesn't know what's (not) coming.",
            "thanks guys",
            "I like these changes, props mods!",
            "The old Reddit page is definitely neglected currently. I hope that we can get to improving it sooner than later.",
            "The mods have a function to see the history of mod actions taken against an account, so they can tell that pretty easily.\n\nHowever, that doesn't help users if someone has a history of it manages to slip another by the mods for a bit. User flair for infractions may be helpful.",
            "We're hoping that a 24 hour ban for each infraction is enough to dissuade users from posting them after the first time. If it still continues to be an issue, we may change this further in the future.",
            "Hold, I heard mods have Lunar New Year sales lined up next week.",
            "Yeah we need a \"Chief\" flair",
            "Oos",
            "You think it'll go lower during black Friday?",
            "Yeah this is one of those buy now, ask later kinda deals",
            "OS sales are banned per the other stickied mod post, everything else is still allowed. For the others, use similar flairs or the Other flair. ex. Headset falls under Headphones, Router falls under Networking",
            "The HDD flair is currently intended for only internal HDDs, yes.\n\nIf someone wants to look at external HDDs to shuck, they can search using the External Storage flair. The post volume for these products isn't very high.\n\nThe current flair updates aren't set in stone - we might add more flairs to make it easier to search for products such as in this case. The issue is pretty much drawing a line without making a ton of hardly-used flairs.\n\nAs for NAS, it's used for storage. It's related to networking and it is an entire computer, but it is external storage. If someone wanted to post a NAS enclosure under any appropriate flair, we wouldn't make a fuss about it.",
            "Since it is a marketplace site, there are third party sellers. Some abuse the platform to post scam listings or sell grey market items like Windows activation keys that may or may not work.",
            "From what I understand, Woot was simply selling invalid Windows keys. No clue on the source, but tons of people were having issues.",
            "This has been brought up numerous times by users, and the answer is no.\n\nPosts can only have one flair. Adding a Microcenter flair would not work with the current product category based flairs and would make search functionality more difficult for users.\n\nThe rules already require that in-store only deals such as Microcenter specify such in the title, and that in-store only deals must be available at multiple locations. This makes sifting through posts easier for users.",
            "Nice try, maybe in the next year or two. Gotta cater to the 1% that can actually make it to one of these stores.",
            "We don\u2019t regulate what gets posted for the most part. If it belongs on the sub and isn\u2019t problematic or breaks a rule, it stays up. Votes will push good deals up and bad deals down.",
            "They aren't regularly in stock and they're still in high demand.",
            "It's still there. If the sidebar options aren't working, just search with flair:furniture on the sub",
            "We're not sure what the issue is - Reddit loves to update the interface constantly which also doesn't help. For now we recommend just using flair: in search (ex. flair:PSU) to find what you want",
            "Don't rush to post and check it out first. It's not an unavoidable **accident**",
            "For anyone who wants a little bit more info out of curiosity or for their own moderation uses - we use toolbox to simplify mod actions. \n\nIt allows you to easily do mod actions from posts/comments on old Reddit (unfortunately does not work on new Reddit). As well, it allows you to add notes on users that link to posts/comments and displays them next to usernames. We use this functionality to keep track of bans much easier.",
            "Let's hope so! I appreciate all of the work you guys put in for us in the pursuit of saving a buck.",
            "Still waiting",
            "As far as I can tell, the search function supports [exclusions](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/search?q=flair%3AHDD+-external&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) and [intersections](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/search?q=flair%3AHDD+internal&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) but not [unions](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/search?q=flair%3ACPU+or+flair%3AGPU&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all), which should inform the design of flairs.\n\nMy preference would be to have [HDD] flair on all 3.5\" spinners, internal or external, and strongly suggest the use of \"internal\" or \"external\" in the post titles. 2.5\" portable spinners, which don't require external power, should probably go with the usb flash drives, with a strong suggestion to use \"HDD\" in the post title.\n\nP.S., I'm not currently seeing External Storage in the sidebar either on New or Old Reddit.",
            "Holy crap, *Woot is a marketplace now??* how the mighty have fallen.",
            "Thx. Did not realize that only one tag could be applied.",
            "Around 40% of people live within an hour of Microcenter in the U.S.\n\nMost people are fine with the current requirements of specifying in-store only in the title and requiring deals be available at multiple locations given the limitations of Reddit regarding post flairs",
            "The response from mods said there is a valid reason, as there is only one tag allowed. \nSome times you have to accept there are limitations of the software. This isn't about 1% at all.",
            "Yes they are.",
            "Oh sick, thanks!",
            "Let us hope that old Reddit sticks around for years to come. We all know that the admins would love nothing but to kill off the old Reddit and push even more ads and monetization on everyone as is present in the newer, clunkier Reddit layout.",
            "New reddit has a notes function like that baked in, and its in the official app as well. Same thing with showing notes, prior mod actions, prior temp bans, etc. We use it in two of the subs I mod.",
            "I been around this sub since before you made your reddit account and the microcenter debacle has always been brought up. With usually only a couple of dudes being able to get the deal if they can even make it to the store.\n\nThey usually get posted in the middle of the day and always have limited stock, with the first goers always cherry picking the best mobos and cpus then the deal dying a quiet death. 40% might live within one hour but most people aren't skipping out of work to go get that.\n\nIt's just disappointing seeing such a long standing issue being ignored on this latest restructuring of the flairs. It has come to the point that people either go away when the microcenter bomb comes or just moved on to other aggregators on a permanent basis.",
            "When 99% of the users want to filter the post it's a matter of catering to the 1%. \n\nProbably one of the factors that have led to the slowdown of good deals being posted along with overall worse pricing in general since the pandemic.",
            "You're right, they are still in high demand.",
            "Never seen an ad on New Reddit.",
            "Because of a software limitation of one tag.",
            "Every time people complain about Microcenter posts there is a disproportionate amount of people advocating they stay.\n\nWhy? Because most reasonable folks realize that if a sale doesn't apply to them, they move on.\n\nAlso, lol at flexing your reddit account age.",
            "According to who?",
            "Because microcenter has always been favored despite having miniscule amount of stores even after they have doubled the amount in the last few years. It was a huge struggle just to get them to make people mention in store only. And only at the end, when you already wasted time reading everything else.\n\nThere def was much bigger pushback against tiktok despite most people being able to participate on these deals. For a while I thought we were gonna get a tiktok flair before we got a microcenter flair.",
            "It's not about flexing the age, but expecting people to understand that the problem has been around way longer than their account has been around yet they just ignore it.\n\nAlmost nobody bats for these microcenter deals, why? Because they don't apply to most people since not everybody has time to run out to the store to grab the 8 good mobos at 1pm on a work day. Or run out 2hrs wasting a ton of gas to save $5 on a cpu.\n\nYet asking for a flair to filter these in store posts gets treated like you asking for their first born.",
            "Unless Reddit changes post flairs to allow for multiple, we are not going to add any retailer-specific flairs.",
            "Yes I know, if management here listened to the people they would've done us the solid a few years ago before everyone gave up and left. But mods come and go and maybe in a couple of years we got better management."

            "Highest tier standard 6800 from ASRock for sale by ASRock USA. I\u2019ve bought one of these and two 6900 XTs from them before, things to note:\n\n- Typically comes in a white unmarked box with anti-static wrap and good foam.\n\n- Some models come with cosmetic blemishes, though most of mine have been flawless. Some have even come with plastic still on the fans and logos.\n\n- ASRock USA does NOT offer a warranty on these items beyond the 30 day return (confirmed by phone and text chat with ASRock USA). Treat this like any other used purchase, albeit from a reputable source.\n\nI\u2019ve had great experience with this card. Probably the cheapest way to get 16GB of VRAM. Good luck!",
            "lot of gpu for $300, pretty awesome deal considering 6700/6750xt's go for around this much",
            "In for one.  Thanks OP.",
            "Worth risking if I'm upgrading from a 6650xt?",
            "They have a 6700xt listed for $240 as well.",
            "Thanks god it\u2019s gone",
            "Imho, if you absolutely need a capable gpu now to wait for next gen. This is as good as it gets.",
            "Is this it chief?",
            "Jesus, that's a good deal. Rdna2 has been a beacon of hope in these dark times",
            "No longer available.",
            "Really trying to stick with my 1080ti but this is tempting.",
            "I just got the XFX RX6800 new from amazon for $359 and im within the return period. Is it worth it to buy this and return?",
            "Upgrade from a 2080 ti worth it?\u00a0",
            "Dang it's available again",
            ">ASRock USA does NOT offer a warranty on these items beyond the 30 day return (confirmed by phone and text chat with ASRock USA). Treat this like any other used purchase, albeit from a reputable source.\n\nInteresting, I was told they had 1 year of warranty when bought 6900xt formula. Mine came with poor thermal paste and would shut down under load. Repasting fixed it.",
            "Yo shoot me a message about clanwars.cc",
            "it's definitely a hell of a card and this price ain't bad. Mine's powering my 3440x1440 setup and doing pretty damn good...",
            "Haha no more temptation?",
            "Thx for the heads up, post flair changed.",
            "Up to you. This one is cheaper, but yours should have a warranty. It depends on what you are comfortable with.\n\nPersonally, I would purchase the ASRock, test it while I still had the XFX, and then return the XFX after I was sure the ASRock was working properly.",
            "I mean, the 6800 compares favorably but very comparatively to 3080 as far as that goes, so a 2080ti should still be pretty close... I'd say probably not unless yours is dying or something.",
            "No way. It would be, on average, a whopping 16 extra fps over what you have at 1440p.\n\n\nIgnore that this is a 6700 XT review and just look at the charts.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.techpowerup.com/review/sapphire-radeon-rx-6700-xt-nitro/28.html",
            "Probably but unless you're desperate to upgrade because you can't run some games I'd hold off a bit longer. This is just the start of a general GPU price cut and better deals should be coming along in the next couple of 3-4 weeks.\n\nIt's a lot of card for $300 but a 2080 ti should still be a good GPU for 1440 and even some 4k gaming. If you're looking to upgrade for ray tracing this is definitely not the card.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I'm a pretty hopeless AMD fanboy so my view may be biased but I'm currently running a 2070 super and am still happy with how it games. I'm holding off for the bigger deals.",
            "Not really. I'd rather wait for 7000 series to go on an actually good sale or keep an eye out for 4070 ti deals.\n\nAlternatively a used 3080 can be found for ~$400 easily",
            "i'd say no.\n\n2080 ti still pretty strong, the 6800 isn't that much better. \n\ni'd probably just wait for the next generation of cards (or much better discounts on current generation).",
            "Not really, no.",
            "I called them and they told me no, so YMMV I guess. Mine wasn\u2019t crashing but I also repasted my 6900XT formula. I\u2019d never seen a card run at a 100+ degree hotspot 24/7 before and it was making me nervous.",
            "It's available again",
            "Why do you say better deals are too come? I'm asking because I'm looking for a GPU and ready to pull the trigger",
            "Yea, mine was chilling at 115 and then would just end itself. I actually thought it was my PSU couldn't handle the power spikes at first until I pulled up the gpu temps graph. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/1cakv0z/gpu\\_asrock\\_amd\\_radeon\\_rx\\_6900\\_xt\\_oc\\_formula\\_16gb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/1cakv0z/gpu_asrock_amd_radeon_rx_6900_xt_oc_formula_16gb/)\n\nFrom there the top comment also got 1 year warranty, so unless it's different for the 6800xt, might be worth calling multiple times and seeing if you get a different agent for anyone who gets a lemon with this.",
            "Honestly, there are always better deals to come. Buy your parts whenever it is you need them. If you can wait, your $400 purchase will eventually be $300, then $200, until it just runs out of stock. Really the only times to truly wait are right before certain holidays, announcements, or releases.",
            "I get that. I just thought they knew something I didn't."

            "Kinda cool that you can do an inverted build to have all the heat from the GPU come out the top.",
            "This is the best mATX case imo, all things considered. 22L, while mini-ITX cases like the NR200P are 18L. You get a very small form factor without the $100+ mini-ITX tax.\u00a0",
            "Real bargain",

            "This is the Pro, so it's more like 26L, iirc, and more like 30L with the extension",
            "Agree completely. I recently built a workshop PC in one and it was fun to build in. Some space constraints, but I was able to fit a h97m mobo, 16GB ram, 1231v3, thermalright ps120se, evga gtx 970 ftw and a 512gb 2.5\" SSD in there.\n\nVery solid little case.",
            "Where\u2019s USB-C if it is the \u201cbest\u201d?",
            "Best, taking price into consideration. Additionally, the IM01 Pro has a USB-C for $20ish more. However, the Pro is 26L. I personally think that the lack of USB-C is what you get for 22L and $55.\u00a0\n\n\n\nEdit: Actually, the IM01 Pro is on sale for $55 as well.\u00a0",
            "Yeah the IM01 Pro is the most Pro SAMA case.\n\nI would go with a FSP CST350 Plus or Lian Li Lancool 185M over a SAMA IM01 though. Maybe a Sapphire Nitro M01 or Techware Fusion depending on pricing.",
