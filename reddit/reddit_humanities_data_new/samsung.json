        "title": "Samsung OLED Monitors at Summer Games Fest",
        "score": 6,
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1ddtzc2/samsung_oled_monitors_at_summer_games_fest/",
        "content": "Many of you guys loved our Samsung CES coverage, and Samsung invited a few of us out to attend Summer Games Fest 2024. Why? I wasn't sure either lol. But I bet it has something to do with the New Odyssey OLED G8:\n\nI am a gamer (with about 12k too many hours in Apex), and I also do a lot of content creation, that means my monitor needs to be good for content creation AND gaming. Currently I use an HP Omen 27i, it uses that LG NanoIPS panel everyone was raving about a few years back (LG 27GL85). And it serves me well. However, after using the Galaxy Book Pro 3 360 last year, I feet in love with having more OLED screens in my life. However, after having the reddit icons burned in on my Note8 I have always been weary of OLED screens. I swore that I would never purchase an OLED Laptop/TV/Monitor. But when I saw the (and bought) the Asus ZenBook Duo (display made by Samsung) my tune changed. Not to say modern OLED panels are abuse proof, but I feel like they are they are in a \"good\" place. And that was BEFORE Samsung came out with the new G8. It has a new liquid cooling system and software tricks would keep this display working at its peak for a while (Samsung does give a three-year warranty). In person, the G8 and G6 **felt cooler than my LCD monitors I use at home,** and these monitors were probably on for hours. I got the opportunity to speak with a few people that worked on Samsung's newest monitors at Summer Games Fest. I really want to share with r/Samsung how passionate these guys where. One Samsung guy was so excited about the G8, explaining how studios are now opting for reference monitors that have \\*the same panel as the g8\\* Now in that context, the price of the G8 is a value meal lol. Especially in the context of Apple Pro Display XDR, and other monitors in this class.  Not for my budget, but for those who can afford this, buyers are going to have a \"pro- grade\" product. When I commented on the viewing angles, he was so glad I noticed that he proceeded to roll the gaming char I was sitting on around the monitor to showcase the (amazing) viewing angles.\n\n\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/o0gq1l9v816d1.gif\n\n\n\nI also spoke with someone who was involved with the software running on these new monitors. Multicontrol is coming, so you can control Galaxy devices with peripherals connected to one of the new monitors. The monitors with smart features also have thread, and all the other tricks the TV's do. Including Samsung Gaming Hub.\n\nWhy would someone use Samsung Gaming Hub with a Gaming PC? You can cloud game if your PC is being used for rendering. Now that's a niche use case, but I use gForce NOW often while my PC is busy. So that's how **I** would use it\n\nThe displays also support HDR10+, I like that Samsung continues to push the license-free HDR10+ as alternative to the (paid) Dolby standards. I also passed on feedback I commonly seen on r/Samsung to whoever would listen to me. \n\n**Things only** u/StephanCevallos905 **would care about**\n\n* **RGB**\n   * **Ring on back:** It does have and RGB ring, that you can change with the remote, HOWEVER it DOES NOT have an \"ambient aware\" mode. It DOES have the ability to match the white temp on screen and emit white light that matches the scene. So, you get some \"light\" immersion (pun not intended)\n* **Build**\n   * The monitor is aluminum, I feel like this helps with heat dissipation. \n   * the base and stand feel sturdy. Moving the monitor felt smooth, I also like how low profile the stand is rather than having bulky legs.\n\n# Odyssey OLED Series:\n\nSamsung is expanding its Odyssey OLED lineup with the new Odyssey OLED G8 and G6 models. Here are the highlights:\n\n* **Odyssey OLED G8 (G80SD)**\n   * **Size:** 32 inches\n   * **Resolution:** 4K UHD (3840 x 2160)\n   * **Refresh Rate:** 240Hz\n   * **Response Time:** 0.03ms (GtG)\n   * **Features:** AI-powered NQ8 AI Gen3 processor, Samsung OLED Safeguard+ burn-in prevention, Dynamic Cooling System, FreeSync Premium Pro, and Core Lighting+.\n* **Odyssey OLED G6 (G60SD)**\n   * **Size:** 27 inches\n   * **Resolution:** QHD (2560 x 1440)\n   * **Refresh Rate:** 360Hz\n   * **Response Time:** 0.03ms (GtG)\n\nBoth models feature Samsung\u2019s new proprietary burn-in prevention technology and matte coating seen on TVs\n\n# Smart Monitor M8: \n\nThe Smart Monitor M8 (M80D) now comes with advanced AI features:\n\n* **Size:** 32 inches\n   * **Resolution:** 4K UHD (3840 x 2160)\n   * **Features:** AI upscaling, Active Voice Amplifier Pro, 360 Audio Mode, built-in SlimFit Camera, Samsung DeX compatibility, and Workout Tracker.\n\nThese features make it a versatile hub for both entertainment and productivity.\n\n# ViewFinity Series:\n\nSamsung\u2019s ViewFinity lineup is designed for creative professionals and offers:\n\n* **ViewFinity S8 (S80UD and S80D)**\n   * **Sizes:** 27 inches and 32 inches\n   * **Resolution:** 4K UHD (3840 x 2160)\n   * **Brightness:** 350 nits\n   * **Features:** HDR10 support, USB hub, height-adjustable stand, and built-in KVM switch with USB-C port.\n* **ViewFinity S7 and S6**\n   * **Sizes:** S7: 27 inches and 32 inches, S6: 24 inches, 27 inches, and 32 inches\n   * **Resolution:** S7: 4K UHD, S6: QHD (2560 x 1440)\n   * **Brightness:** 350 nits\n\nIf anyone has questions for me or Samsung, drop them below and I will \\[try my best\\] to answer them.\n\nDisclaimer: Samsung hosted me at Summer Games Fest but had no expectations of me posting/promoting/publishing anything. No money (or monitor) was exchanged. ",

            "Most of the monitors are 4K, I felt like text was sharp. It was noticeably crisp when reading small signs in video games",
            "That's personally something I'd like to test more of, since I currently have a 32\" QHD LCD monitor and have started to notice the lack of sharpness in text.  \n\nI only briefly got to see the 32\" Odyssey OLED G8 at Summer Game Fest last week (I was also invited to check them out alongside OP), though, plus it was in a room with a lot of natural lighting so I couldn't really evaluate much.",
            "Thought people should know. There is a difference in colour volume and perceived brightness. At least, that's what we saw in Vegas during CES",
            "I (non-expert opinion) feel like QD-OLED is basically a different technology. The difference IRL is that drastic. You can get blinded by reds, blues, and greens the way other (non WOLED) displays can. Except you also get the deep blacks of W/OLED",
            "It is different tech and people should know what they're buying. That's the colour volume difference you see because of how the tech actually works. The MLA WOLED of LG G3 and G4 is the only real contender"

        "content": "Update to my original post here https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/s/9qYWK1WXGr\n\nI posted this last November around the Black Friday sales, most of the responses from people online weren\u2019t very helpful or were sarcastic. So I thought I\u2019d post an update on what I had to do to resolve the issue in case it happens to someone else. \n\nI contacted Samsung and Samsung Finance through multiple channels, calls, Twitter, even emailed the UK president. But their internal investigation always concluded that the items were delivered and the implication was that I did something dodgy on my end. \n\nThe last resort was to contact the UK Financial Ombudsman service, which is an independent government set up mediator. \n\nThey reviewed my evidence and CCTV footage from Samsung\u2019s warehouse and concluded that they had no proof that the phone I ordered was ever placed into the package. Hence the ordered Samsung to give me a full refund of my deposit and monthly payments with 8% interest. \n\nIf something like this happens to you, do the following:\n\n- Document everything, take pics of the box, the items, packaging as soon as you realise something is off. \n- Document any small details that might show what could have gone wrong, in my case I only realised the inside of the box was damaged after opening it. But still document these details. \n- I\u2019d recommend recording the unboxing of any high value parcels in detail to show it being sealed and you opening it for the first time. \n- if the worse does happen, call customer services asap and record call logs. Ask for them to block the device asap and do so in writing. \n- keep a record of events so your side of the story is as coherent and accurate as possible. \n\n- Hope for the best, it a tough situation to be in and you\u2019ll need a lot of patience, it took around 7 months for me to get my refund. \n\n- Contact your credit card provider and/or financial ombudsman service if you\u2019re in the UK\n\n- I\u2019d also recommend collecting your phone in person so you avoid all this risk. \n\nHopefully this helps someone one day.

            "Multiple times a day for photoshopping, taking  screenshots, translating text, for  magnification. To select and Cooy paste text. To write in notes or search boxes. To save images to create stickers, to take pictures, to pause play and skip music. Frankly thr fact there are people who aren't using it and can't find a use for it are deliberately not trying to out of sheer ignorance and arrogance \n\n\n\n]",

If I need to sketch something and I'm too lazy to get up and find some paper and a pen.\n\nNow that I think about it, I'd prefer having a headphone jack over the S pen.....\n\nBut that would cut into the mutilbillion dollar earbud industry. \n\nApple and Samsung are asshats for removing Microsoft, removable batteries, and headphone jacks.",

I (carefully) put the phone screen down on the ground, and used the pen to take photos of my wife and I standing above it with the bamboo towering over us. Everyone said those pics were awesome. You CAN do it with Siri on an iphone, but not as easily.\n\nAnd then we were at the Korean dmz, and the 100x space zoom on my 23 ultra crushed all the iphones taking pics into north Korea.",

Now, I have one problem: I've started to watch more content a lot, but my phone (S22) is pretty small to comfortably do so (at least for me), so I'm looking for a tablet based around this:\n\n1. Good screen\n2. Good processor: I might use this as an extra monitor as well in some cases, so yeah.\n3. Good speakers\n4. Good size: Small enough to use comfortably in bed and large enough to use as a secondary monitor.\n\nShould I wait for the S10? Buy a S9+? S9 FE+? S8 Ultra? It would be my first tablet. The most important thing... Budget? I have no idea. I just want to know my options.\n\n\nThanks!!",

            "For your needs, even an S7+ is more than enough. That tablet is AMAZING, you can get it for dirty cheap, and overall will suit your needs perfectly.\n\nBUT...\n\nSamsung released it before the \"I support my devices more than you\" hype, so it isn't being updated anymore. Do you care about that? If you do, then S9 is the way to go. If you don't, you can get the exact same experience with an S7+ for 30% of the price, but you won't have One UI 6.1, no Android 14, and anything beyond.",
            "I have an S6 Lite - I've just purchased an S9+ as it is being sold for a great price at the moment and I think a 12.4\" tablet seems to be in the sweet spot for content consumption and not that large it is unweldy to use laying on the couch etc.\n\nI was thinking about waiting for the S10 release, but for possibly a slightly faster processor and maybe slightly higher peak brightness it might not be worth the extra $500 it may cost.",
