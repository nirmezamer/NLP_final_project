        "content": "my opinion is that FSD should be bound to your Tesla account, and always yours on your account, this way there are no \u201cdifficulties\u201d on the sale process as stated by Elon on last call. You log in with your account, and bam, it\u2019s unlocked. Log out? Disable. Log in in another car? Unlock, simple. Also should be available in my opinion to all cars in your account, but ok, allow to transfer from car to car inside the account, activate in only one car (or 2 or 3, how many fsd licenses you bought), lock to the car for a month or 6 months or so, if they don\u2019t want people to keep changing it.\n\nWhat do you all think?",

            "This kind of post has been made before. Why does tesla not do that? Because they can profit more from the gimick of FSD by locking it into one car instead of one account.",
            "No it should be locked to neither and be transferred as simple as a form. \n\nWant to transfer it to a new car? Great. Want it to stay with the car your selling and don't have another Tesla? Done. Want to sell it to someone else and keep the car. Done.",
            "Then the price would be higher.",
            "What if you have more than one car on your account? FSD is hardware dependent. By making it tied to a car that has the proper hardware, you avoid confusion about where you can or can\u2019t apply the floating credit. \nI think it makes sense as an upgrade on the car just like any other software or feature upgrade. But I do like the ability to transfer it in the future.",
            "All other features on any other car have always been \u201ccar locked\u201d. Hardware like a moon roof for example. Also, what if a different car doesn\u2019t have the right hardware? Not saying I disagree, but I think those are the reasons.",
            "Tesla, in all likelihood, is probably going to kill off the option to purchase FSD outright and just make it a $100 a month subscription, like a phone bill.  There's more profit in it in the long run, and less people bitching about transfers.\n\nElon made a statement during the shareholder meeting about how \"for a low monthly fee, these cars will drive themselves around\", which tells me, in his mind, FSD isn't a package that's bought, it's a service you pay extra for, like a cell phone plan.\n\nPeople wanting FSD to follow the *person* are stupid.\n\nFSD has *massive* on going R&D costs.  It's not something you crank out and say \"Ok, we're done here\".  It is going to continually evolve and improve over time.\n\nIf you sold FSD once and tied it to the user, wherein they could use it anywhere they wanted, then there'd be an upper limit as to how often they could sell it, and they likely wouldn't be able to keep funding the R&D anymore.\n\nLet's look at Microsoft as an example, because honestly they're the most comparative.\n\nWhen you buy a computer from the store, it comes with a copy of Windows.  That machine has a Certificate of Authenticity (COA), and the license *cannot* be transferred to another computer.  When a new version of Windows comes out, you're typically offered an upgrade discount, where instead of paying $120 for Windows, you can pay $80 or something.\n\nEventually, however, the hardware on the computer ages itself out of being able to run newer versions of Windows, and you need to buy a new computer.  When you buy the new computer you get another copy of Windows that cannot be transferred, and the cycle starts anew.\n\nThis is, in effect, the position that Tesla is in.  Every time they release a new FSD hardware version, they can release a newer/better version of FSD software to run on it, but at some point the older hardware is going to stop running the newer software.  For HW3 people, that moment is coming up at the end of this year.  We'll still see some improvements, but once they start working on HW4, it'll start doing shit better than HW3 can.  Not right away, might take a year or two, but it will.  Just like when they're ready to start doing HW5 the HW4 folks will slowly stop getting cool shit.\n\nIt's going to be a never-ending cycle.\n\nIf they allow free unlimited FSD package transfers, they'd never properly fund the initiative.\n\nVarious holes can be poked in my analogy above, because Microsoft *does* sell a retail license, where if you buy a barebones computer, you can go to the store and buy a copy of Microsoft and slap it down on the machine, and *that* license is transferable to a new computer, however, it doesn't let you upgrade to a newer copy of Windows for free, but you can buy an upgrade license for a discount.\n\nAnother hole that can be poked is that the upgrade from Windows 8 to 10, and 10 to 11, were both free, however, Microsoft was effectively doing **a lot** of damage control from how bad Windows 8 was, and they're also trying to encourage people to stay on a current release of Windows for security purposes.  That said, going from Windows 10 to 11 isn't always easy.  There's a hardware restriction in that upgrade path in that your computer has to have a TPM 1.2 chip so that Windows 11 can properly leverage its security features and such, so for some people their only option to go from Windows 10 to Windows 11 *is* to buy a new computer, even if they have a retail copy of Windows and an upgrade license, there's a hardware incompatibility.\n\nSo, I get where people are coming from about wanting FSD to follow the user, however, in the long run, there's no profit there, and the profit is important to fun R&D to make FSD better.\n\nAnyone who bought the FSD package, myself included as I've bought it twice, needs to accept the fact that it's tied to car you bought it for, and when you trade the car in, or sell it, FSD needs to be purchased again.  I've been fine with it the entire time, *because* I'm aware of the development costs and such.  I've bought FSD at $6,000 and $12,000.  In retrospect, I regret not getting the monthly subscription on the $12,000 car.\n\n*All that said*, I do believe that there's a path for Tesla to offer \"upgrade discounts\", much like Microsoft did, where if FSD is currently $8,000 a person who already owns it and is buying it again can buy it for 50% off or something as a \"loyalty discount\", or if they *do* make it subscription only, then the person can convert their $8,000 FSD license to say four years of FSD on a new car, then $100 a month after that.\n\nSo, yeah, that's my rather lengthy thought on that.\n\nStop bitching about a lack of license transfers, they need to pay for the development of the software somehow, and this is *very* common in the software industry.  The only \"perpetual software\" licenses that you see now involve paying monthly fees to get at the newer versions.",
            "It should be treated as a license like most other software. You own the license to use it on one device at a time but that can be any device. \n\nTesla has the mistaken belief that they will make more money if it is tied to a car. I disagree as we all see how many people refuse to buy it not knowing they can keep it.",
            "I\u2019m another that would move up to an X if I could transfer FSD to the new one. I only had EAP but would pay the $2000 to get FSD before purchasing the X.",
            "I don't disagree -- Tesla is basically using the money for R&D.\n\nThe true Full Self Driving feature that works the way we want it to (and the way Tesla implies how it will one day work) will never appear on any Tesla on the road today.\n\nBut keep dropping the cash for \"FSD\" to play with a shitty beta.",
            "It would be too easy to pirate if they did that. You could just let other people log into your account and people could sell fsd. Keeping it var specific makes more sense .",
            "If it was just a gimmick, why would locking it to a car vs an account affect profit? Wouldn't everyone who buys FSD only buy it once, realize it's a gimmick and never even consider moving it to another car or buying it again?",
            "Sure I understand that, but also it hurts the \u201ccar upgrade\u201d if people cannot transfer the fsd, and someone in the used market basically gets the FSD for free! Most people if cannot transfer don\u2019t buy the fsd again specially if they never got to use it, like in Europe, and someone else got it for free, so same \u201cnet result\u201d for Tesla. It makes more sense keeping the license with who payed and supported them, to someone that bought the car second hand, giving no money to Tesla for it\u2026.",
            "What's stopping me from removing a sun roof from one car and putting it into another compatible car?  The glass/panel what ever not talking about the hole. \n\nTesla upgrades the hardware if you don't already have it. You can buy the FSD subscription and get an upgrade and never subscribe again.",
            "Yeah your argument could make sense, if you think that there are other places in the world besides America\u2026 you know the most of the world cannot use FSD because it is still a flawed and unapproved product right? You know that in Europe, you can buy FSD but YOU CANNOT USE IT?!",
            "its really not that bad. its not \"fully\" autonomous, but i'm pretty sure it can be, at least in SoCal suburbs.  \n\nAside from the system bugging me to pay attention, I don't really have to pay that much attention. It might not be perfect, but it is certainly not shitty imo.",
            "You described me exactly.  I can't keep my FSD, so I'm not buying another Tesla.",
            "That\u2019s why they are pushing it as a subscription. Which at its current cost makes alot more sense.",
            "People buying a used Tesla with FSD only get it \"free\" if the person selling the car doesn't adjust the price up to include a portion of the cost of FSD.\n\nEven Tesla offers you about $3,000-4,000 for FSD when you trade the vehicle into them.",
            "Completely beside the point. Car features have always been connected to the car, not the person. Sunroof, AWD, turbocharger, spoiler, heated seats, cd player, everything ever since cars were invented follow the car when it\u2019s sold. By introducing accounts where software features could be connected to a person instead, Tesla is probably playing safe by keeping features connected to the car simply not to veer away from tradition too quickly. It takes a good reason for a company to  give away stuff they worked like a dog to build.",
            "This is a really bad analogy.",
            "My argument makes sense regardless of location.\n\nIt's not Tesla's fault your government isn't letting them release it there",
            "You\u2019re just wasting your time trying to argue with some people. \n\nSome people around here want to act like FSD tries to drive them off the Hoover dam every time they turn it on. \n\nWe\u2019ve got 1700 miles on my wife\u2019s MYLR. I\u2019ve put about 1000 of those miles on, using the FSD trial. We aren\u2019t renewing the subscription because she drives about 20 miles a day and won\u2019t use it, but we absolutely plan on purchasing a month here and there when we have a road trip.\n\nIs it perfect? No, and I don\u2019t expect it to be. But holy shit does it make road trips so much easier.\n\nHating FSD is like hating the band nickleback. Some people do it just to fit in.",
            "Yeah I'd probably upgrade my 2020 if it transferred",
            "Exactly this. Just buy it for a month if you're planning on a long trip where it'll be used.",
            "No one on the used market is paying more than an extra $1k for it.",
            "Ok how about a more common example. \n\nA car head unit. I have a base model golf. What's stopping a friend from transferring their higher end model into mine. \n\nSame with heated seats. Sure it's work but you could swap the parts over. \n\nI don't think keeping it to an account is the right answer but I think it should be treated like any other part of the car, much like my radio, it should be transferable. I upgrade the radio on my car. I should be able to take it out and sell the car with its original base radio.",
            "This is the reality. Actually most dealer don\u2019t even know about the package",
            "Where am I saying anything is stopping you? If you've ever looked at a used car ad, the used car mostly includes all the original features and you're asking me that is. WTF. Why? Because people don't bother, that's why. But again, it's completely beside the point I'm making so I'll leave you with that, bye."

            "So I hear this a lot, and only have anecdotes as evidence. I travel a lot for work and stay in hotels and rent cars, and I feel that 95% of us at hotels and the rental car lot fall into 3 categories, with the 4th being an exception.\n\n1. Contractors that travel for work\n\n2. Construction workers traveling for work\u00a0\n\n3. Displaced families because fire/flood/maintenance\n\n4. Tourists.\n\nTourists being rare on weekdays and a bit more common on weekends, but mostly parents with kids.\n\nI say that because categories 1-3 will never drive a car hard. Tourists probably would, but they have kids in the back.\n\nSo a small minority of renters need to be tourists and have the opportunity to abuse their rental.\n\nTbh, even late mileage cars I\u2019ve rented have been a bit dirty/musty, but nothing that can\u2019t be cleaned up in a few hours. No more beat up than a regular family car.\n\nHOWEVER. The paint is always a disaster. Paint swirls, contamination, chips, water spots, scratches, etc. Again, nothing that a good buffer and a wax weekend can\u2019t fix either.\n\nI\u2019d say \u201cluxury\u201d rental cars are an excellent deal.

My rate was still \"good\" (6.7%, though nothing is really a good rate these days). Definitely utilize the online used Tesla checklist before you purchase as it's helpful remember where to check on the car before purchase.

Also, a big factor that made me pick this one was the fact that it didn't have curb rash on any of the wheels lol. Only issue is, one caveat to these is that they'll more than likely need tires soon after buying. Hertz just slaps whatever size fits on them and sends it. I have 2 different tire brands on mine currently, will be getting new tires soon.",
            "Display was fine, and the interior is very clean. No stains, rips, nothing. Luckily the Hertz I bought from had maybe over a hundred Teslas to choose from, so I got to really find a decent one. No curb rash, clean interior, etc.",

But it just sits there for a week. They never actually even went to check the car. I still have it on my account. I still see battery is going down day by day. My return status in the app shows incomplete. I still get billed, etc. I sent a few emails to billing and lease return departments, but no response. I just bough another Model Y with diff. specs and whole experience was bad as well. It looks like Tesla is critically understaffed. Some showroom people told me they work 12-14 hours a day and it's always busy. People just coming to showroom non-stop with just a few people working. It's not surprising that they overlook a lot of things. I hope thing will get better soon.",
