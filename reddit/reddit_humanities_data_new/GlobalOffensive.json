            "I bookmark the links to cheaters accounts. After 2 years of doing this and having 50+ bookmarked links, not a single one has been banned yet lol. I played 2 games today and in one of them the other team was playing weird but after watching the demo I couldn't say for sure they were cheating, until I checked their top fraggers account on a match tracking website and he had 76 kills in the previous game he played. 1100 hours time played on his account btw.\n\nOther games with 90ms ping feel wayy smoother than this game with 45ms ping. Subtick just simply sucks. The cheap fucks couldn't afford 128 tick servers huh?\n\nI have several clips in which I'm completely stationary and my crosshair is in the middle of their head or in the middle of their torso when I have the AWP, and after I die it says 0 damage dealt. This games is far from finished, It's not even beta, it's in its alpha stage.\n\nAlso it's kinda funny it's supposedly built from scratch in a new engine but many of the infamous CSGO problems are still in it.\n\nIt's sad that I played this game since I was a child and I still love this game, but I have to uninstall, it's just not a good game.\n\nAnyway, just needed to vent after playing games to have some fun at the end of the day, but I get this.",
            "I'm not sure if its caused by trust update but I got ragecheaters in 5 games in a row. Seems like valve has no clue what they are doing. 29 kills with 100% hs, where is overwatch/vac live ?",
            "This game sucks ass",
            "I'm about to fucking sell all my shit and dip for good bc WTF is this bullshit bro. Since launch I've had just an occasional VAC issue where for some reason and very randomly it would tell me VAC can't verify. Well now today after literally 2 deathmatches and halfway into a 3rd it kicks me saying for the first time that something is interfering with VAC when I have made absolutely zero changes to my PC. Now I just get insta booted from games with zero message.",
            "game unplayable still, if you find matches every lobby have minimum 1 or 2 completly new accounts ofc cheaters with wh how possible 6k hours accounts playing with 200-400 this game suck..., and after last update everybody have stutters problem and mic sound robotic randomly xd 1,5 years still unplayable give us csgo... how long must waiting to playable this shit game and sub-tick is the worst shit, tickrate 128 in csgo was much better",
            "I'm 20k elo in EU Premier and after playing roughly 50 games in the last month, about 40% of my games have a cheater. That's almost every 2nd game. \n\nSometimes when I'm not sure I watch demos to verify (some are hiding a wallhack), the rest is confirmed by insane Leetify stats (aim 97-100) and very low time to damage. Today I played 3 Premier games between 6 and 8 PM, all 3 had blatant cheaters shooting through walls, smokes and flashes, rapid fire etc. If anyone doesn't believe I can provide stats, demos and any kind of proof you would like to see or hear.\n\nAlso this week I saw my first VAC Live, I play in a 3 stack and our 2 randoms were cheaters + one of the enemy guys was also cheating. We were winning like 11:2 and after losing many games and lots of elo to cheaters I was like OK I'll take the free W and move on. Well VAC live happened, game was 12:2 and the only thing I received was XP for a case drop. So I lose elo to cheaters and then when I finally have some cheaters on my side and I can win elo the match gets cancelled. When it gets cancelled I don't understand why the demo is not released. Also VAC Live doesn't give them an immediate VAC ban which is just confusing. Why not? The AI is sure enough to cancel the match but not sure enough to give them a VAC ban?\n\nAnother thing is there are no elo refunds after people get VAC banned. Why not? Cheaters got banned, give me back my elo. \n\nMM ranks are still broken if you can't reach Global. Being Gold Nova means you're meeting many cheaters anyway as it's probably above average in terms of MM rank.\n\nPremier is infested with cheaters once you reach top 1% which is roughly 20k elo.\n\nValve please fix.",
            "It feels like Valve is doing almost nothing to combat the cheaters. Im trying to get my account ranked and theres so many spinners at low elo (\\~5k) that its insane. I cant imagine being a new player and getting qued into this and even bothering with wanting to continue. I guess they care more about case profits and everything else other then trying to make this game good. I can see why valorant is winning over my region (NA). Like who tf would want to play this nonsense when now people are glorifying cheaters along with them streaming themselves ruining premier games. Why should I have to rely on terrible 3rd party platforms like faceit? I swear this game used to be so good and Ive never seen this many blatant cheaters in CSGO then I did in this unfinished terrible alpha game... Truly sad my favorite game is now just destroyed. I have almost zero faith that VAC will ever compete with the likes of vanguard or anything else. My list of blatant spinners that I kept track of have yet to be banned after a month+. Feels like my reports dont do anything at all. What happened to the decade of overwatch data from csgo?",
            "The fact that they gotta \"hide\" these posts in a sub shows you how much they care about the problem. First they combine the reviews of two different games, then they bash and remove comments anybody saying anything about cheaters. You know how easy it is to write a simple script to detect a f-ing bhop? Or better yet when they are not even aiming towards players yet all the tracers go to their heads? Community servers have had this for years on CSGO. Keep gaslighting for valve you soulless bastards.",
            "Can someone explain to me how on earth it is possible to shoot the guns at 1000x fire rate and vac being unable to detect /  unwilling to ban it? seems like the simplest thing. I wonder if valve engineers can even solve fizzbuzz",
            "Anyone know a fix for the mic issues that came out of last update?\n\nMyself and a buddy just randomly sound like static/robot after the update, only affects CS2, and I also run into randoms with the exact same issue.\n\nIts annoying as shit",
            "if faceit, why don't they make it so that each team declare their preferred side first and then only fight when there's a contention? knife fights are kind of a waste of time",
            "The game is chalked full of closet cheaters past 15k rating. Fucking garbage game tbh. Kids toggling wallhacks and triggerbot when they get angry they are losing. Classic counter strike, nothing has changed LOL You either throw games to derank, start cheating, or go to toxic faceit. Thanks valve.",
            "The normal gamemodes of this games are officially unplayable for me. Had to stop premier at 22k EU because of the ragehackers each game.\n\nNow my last 10 mm games had an average of 3 ragehackers per game. None of these games I was able to play. \n\nIt was either their cheater vs our cheater or a full stack of cheaters against just 1 cheater on our team.\n\nIts calso crazy to see that everything seems to be back. Bunnyhob, scout autofire, everything is used.\n\nAnd on the sub, every post about the cheating issue gets deleted, but people love to discuss the pro players.\n\nIt actually sucks to see them able to play the game, when us normies are just not able to play anymore.",
            "I'm in a game right now with 2 cheaters on the other team and 1 on my team :D... All of them blatantly cheating.\n\nNice anti-cheat valve.\n\nAlmost every game has at least 1 person cheating now",
            "[deleted]",
            "3 games last night @16-17k no cheaters opponents was really bad and started cheating accusations in 2 of them, last match was 13-4 blowout, my teamcalled walls on a dude but demo shows he was a beast",
            "Just now I had a CS2 update, For a second I thought \"FINALLY! THE UPDATE IS HERE\", until I saw the update size was 17 MB. My heart sank.",
            "guys, is it just me or does my keyboard not work in games",
            "just came from valorant, why are the guns so inaccurate and how can I get around this? I empty an entire mag (with recoil control) but I end up only doing 20 damage or somethig low",
            "I was considering installing cs2 'cause of the 25th anniversary, but after reading this sub for a while for sure I won't LOL, this game is a piece of garbage and valve is doing nothing to change.\u00a0\n\n\nAt the end of the year I will come back to see how is things going, but my expectations are already pretty low.",
            "I don't get how they still can't get VACNet to simply detect players wallbanging every kill, making 5 kills in less than a sec, all headshots with scout. It can't even detect the basics of rage hacks out there. \n\nThat shit isn't even realistic, which means it's easily bannable, no? Feel like I'm taking crazy pills here.",
            "All my stack have good trust factor, all thousands of hours. We're in the 15k-18k range.\n\n[We run into people like with stats like this](https://i.imgur.com/PDB6IAh.png) or [this](https://i.imgur.com/0lMR7pL.png) or [this](https://i.imgur.com/pqYdxZI.png)\n\nAlways <300 hours or steam profile not setup. Not full on rage hackers but extremely obvious aim/wall hacks. \n\nIt was okay for a week or two but the cheaters are back.",
            "Everyone is using wallhacks and triggerbot when you get around the top 20% of rank. It's just normal now, the community accepts it LOL",
            "Stop playing it then",
            "This upcoming update just needs to be huge... Overwatch, good Anticheat, content with maybe Danger Zone and Operation....",
            "Yeah it's crazy how much this sub pushes the cheating situation under the rug. I made a new account after coming back from 5 years without playing, and it's nearly impossible to play a normal match without cheaters on the competitive playlist. It's more common to find cheaters in both teams than to not have any cheaters...",

            "actually now that i think about it, there maybe a bit of poker involved, if the chosen sides were contention free then both team will know each other's preference where as if they always knife the losing team can hide their preference\n\nso the better questions is is a dynamic where a team can intentionally lose to not reveal their preference better than one where both teams know each other's preference",
            "> Its also crazy to see that everything seems to be back. Bunnyhob, scout autofire, everything is used.\n\nOne thing I don't understand is how a cheater that was on my team could call out where a very distant enemy was. I thought this was solved by the server only communicating the position of players in nearby visleaves already in CS 1.6, so a client would have no way to know other than finding a server exploit.",
            "The entire eco system for counter strike is gambling. Gamble on cases, gamble on scam/skin gambling sites, gamble on pro matches. There is no content in the game. It's just a casino for valve, and a cheaters playground for the players.",
            "> Almost every game has at least 1 person cheating now\n\nMakes you wonder if it's actually true without \"almost\", there's gotta be some that slip by, it would be unfair to count only the ones you can definitely tell",
            "half of my deaths are getting caught with a nade in hand or being flanked/blind spotted, makes me wonder if my timings are just unlucky or i just have no gamesense",
            "dude, this ~~cassino~~ game is dogshit.\n\n\nI mean it, go back to valorant and have a good time, please don't waste your time playing this piece of garbage.\u00a0\n\n\nAll the major problems from CSGO are still present even when they \"build a new engine from the ground up\". Shit, they didn't even bother to make a simple 25th anniversary update.\u00a0",
            "dude don't even remind me of that. They were way ahead of everybody when they introduced they are using AI for anti-cheat. That was 6 years ago and AI is the future of anti-cheat, but somehow as you said, their system can't even detect 5 kills in less than a second with a scout",

            "At least with the amount of cheaters right now, they\u2019ll have plenty of data to combat them, right\u2026 RIGHT?!",
            "After almost a decade of research in AI anti cheat somehow their anti cheat has gotten 10 times worse. Playing this game would make you think technology has gone backwards as a whole. Networking has gotten better, availability of high quality internet has gone way up, yet cs just keeps getting more laggy and latent. PC hardware is much better yet the game keeps running worse and worse. Even throwing a $4k pc at it can't get you a smooth experience.",
            "Seriously. They have fostered cheating communities for so long by not doing anything about them.\n\nCheat providers have steam groups with 10's of thousands of members. If that isn't a slap in the face to the rest of the community, idk what else would be.",

            "just typicall NA behaviour, just wait for like 100 thieves to come crawling back if the PW major stickers are gonna go crazy",
            "The thing that is weird with liquid is they had a almost trophy winning roster and just chose to tear it all apart, Yekindar was playing fantastic, elige was playing ok, nitro was calling well (ik he choose to leave), naf was great in his roles and osee was missing shots but they chose to kick elige and go eu for some reason? with mid eu players as well and yekindar igling like what is that? I think yekindar was a great signing at the time as well, there was a time on liquid when he was the best entry fragger in the world.",
            "I'd argue on behalf of Rainwaker and Patsi. Two insane individuals, but both right at the far ends of the early round/late round spectrum. \n\nA massively passive player that hides mid rounds then has an incredible clutch, on a team with naf.\n\nAnd a massively aggressive player who does his best work making plays and throwing himself into the dangerzone ... on a team with yekindar.\n\nBad management, but not bad players.",
            "The management has been poor ever since covid\n\nI still can't believe they let twistzz go. Naf twistzz and elige is the best, most talented trio that NA ever have\n\nThey should have play together til they became absolutely washed \n\nThe fact they could win trophies and make so many final run and losing to only the greatest cs roster all of time without ever having a t1 awper is so impressive",
            "A lot of this is said in retrospect though. Yekinder and cadian at least are good pickups on paper. Many of these other players are great in their own right too.",
            "You do also have to consider that Liquid has consistently attempted to recruit top players, but that it is just hard and comes down to more than money usually. Karrigan wanted to go to FaZe because he knew the org and what they could offer in terms of management and support IIRC. When ropz went to FaZe from Mouz, Liquid was also interested and afaik even offered him more money, but since he wanted to play with Karrigan there wasn't really anything Liquid could offer to sway him. Same with mONESY, whom they offered a better salary than G2 did allegedly. I sometime struggle to see what players Liquid should have picked up who would realistically go there at the time.",
            "Grim made sense at the time, appeared to be the biggest NA talent at the time. Same stats in NA as Malbs, of course less proven against tier 1, but he did destroy Furia and MIBR with the old Sk core.\n\nFallen was an ettempt to replace Nitro as the awp igl iirc, did not work out as he ended up conflicting with Stewie.\n\nOsee- Best NA awper at the time. Made sense to sign him if the org wanted to remain mainly american. Was also smashing NA teams.\n\nShow- No clue what they were thinking. Probably lost out on main targets and he was cheap?\n\nRainwaker- cheap moneyball signing Daps wanted when they went EU. Did not work out, but not a massive loss since he was dirt cheap\n\nYekindar- Good signing initially at least. After Covid Liquid did not perform well and when they added Yekindar they became title contenders almost instantly. Trended downwards after joining though and his igl stint was a disaster. Ended up in conflict with Elige role wise who was in a slump before joining Complexity.\n\nPatsi- another moneyball signing when Liquid tried to go EU and did not perform. Had reasons to partially believe he could perform at tier 1 level since he had done so previously for Spirit, but did not pick form back up for Liquid. Probably didn't cost a lot.\n\ncadiaN- on paper he should of been an amazing signing, and Liquid under him have not been that bad. Team cohesion is terrible though, and he has not been able to implement his Heroic system in Liquid while his individual form since cs2 released has not been great.\n\nSkullz- Probably the worst on the list. Massive buyout for a player who is both unproven and also clashes with Liquids most valuable player in NAF. They are insanely lucky if they manage to regain half of what they initially paid for him.\n\nTwistzz- Good signing, of course he was always expected to perform and has a history with NAF as well.",
            "Judging by the Cadian situation, I don't think the GM makes roster moves. I think the players make the calls on the team, and the GM helps facilitate that. It's not like traditional sports where the GM is making all the roster calls",
            "They need to do an internal investigation into who's deciding this. An S tier org like liquid shouldn't have made this many bad changes\n\nI will admit, Fallen, Grim and cadian all made sense and Yekindar did work out initially",

            "Solid agree, from an eye test rainwaker wasn\u2019t even bad, he had a very good instinct for playing hard anchor roles like pit- it often just looked like the teams comms were practically nonexistent. Patsi is a bit more dubious, with his inconsistency even from his time in spirit- and while we can\u2019t really say with certainty that these guys were T1 capable, they deserve more than T2 with their performances in the lower levels of CS.",
            "This is NOT said in retrospect, half of these player signings didn\u2019t make any sense. Rainwaker and Parsi were 2 very unknown EU \u201ctalents\u201d that very few heard of which wouldn\u2019t be an issue if you were looking to invest into young talent.\n\nThe issue is that they were never going to invest in young talent and THEY WERENT EVEN NA players. Like wtf is there to invest when you\u2019re an NA org investing into bringing up a Russian player. It\u2019s one thing with rainwaker potentially but he\u2019s not even playing a role that NA needs.\n\nHonestly cadian was the best move they\u2019ve done and I think it\u2019s a mistake letting him go not trying to make it work as that\u2019s a player playing 2 roles your region desperately needs. This team should\u2019ve invested in NA talent way sooner, tired of these weird orgs that are never going to be good international teams trying to just force it because they don\u2019t bring up any talent in their own region.\n\nLike you\u2019re mid af being international anyway might as well cash in on bringing up talent from your region instead like complexity",

When combining it with the main viewport, a depth test between the two must be done to decide which pixel has priority (the wall or the smoke). So as antialiasing is being used in the main viewport, it more than likely messes with it's depth texture, which is probably not antialiased, but even if it was, the value would still get messed up because of averaging with neighbour pixels... and you get this artifact.\n\nWhat I don't think matters in this case, is the depth texture of the smokes viewport being lower resolution and pixels getting mashed together / averaged there as well.\n\nAs a dumb solution: more pixels need to be fetched from the main viewport and pick the highest depth value out of them.",

            ">So basically smokes and game geometry and viewmodels are rendered in their own (dumbed down) \"blank 3D world\" and then mashed together for the final image?\n\nI assume so, yes. You can see smokes having some noise applied to them especially around the edges, probably to break the illusion of pixelization from upscaling (although it still looks scuffed, probably because of my low settings). This method works best when engines implement some form of temporal AA, which works well to smoothen the noise over time (the first frame or few ones will be noisy, but immediately it goes away). There's a nice talk from the devs of INSIDE at GDC covering a special type of noise and some techniques to make good use of it with TAA: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdN06E6Xn9E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdN06E6Xn9E)\n\n>It feels like doing all these depth tests would be very computationally expensive\n\nIn the end rendering those smokes at lower resolutions, maybe 4 times less width and 4 times less height, will most likely lead to performance benefits, in spite of the perf penalty from computing the depth textures and merging the two viewports. But it also leads to some lower visual fidelity, maybe some artifacts and implementation complexity.\n\n>Does the MSAA algorithm code get implemented on the GPU level or the game engine level?\n\nAs far as I know it's done \"on the GPU level\".\n\nAnd regarding of all that I've said above, I could be wrong... I only dipped my pinky toe in computer graphics, but I used the Godot Engine (v3.2 at the time), as straight OpenGL seemed too much to handle for me back then. Here I tried to render some wind swept clouds [https://streamable.com/gjug8w](https://streamable.com/gjug8w) .
