For three weeks a month, men weren't interested, couldn't get it up, etc, and women didn't have to worry about unwanted attention.

The blade is too thin to parry a larger sword by itself. If it had been single edged, i could have placed my hand on the back of the blade to help withstand the impact, but with this i would just cut myself in the hand. Instead, i got to evade.\"\n\nHe handed me a larger piece of plywood, and says \"pretend this is a halbard and hit me\" so i think okay you fucking Kung Fu guy, lets see what you got. So i swing the halbard plywood straight for his knees.\n\nThis guy he makes a sideways flip, and while his head is upside down, mid flip, he made a very, very controlled mark on my neck with his double edged piece of plywood.

Most notably swords like katanas, but plenty of European swords also had a blunt edge for a variety of reasons.\u00a0\n\nThere are also plenty of downsides to double edged swords (more fragile, harder to maintain, can\u2019t easily use a hand on the blade for extra leverage, etc), but it\u2019s true that they\u2019re not really more dangerous to their wielded than single edged swords, which the expression seems to metaphorically refer to, so your shower thought still works.",
            "Doesn't the phrase refer to a sword that cuts both when it goes in and when you pull it out?",

            "Not only that, at one point people used the blade to [thrust forward like a spear, or in some cases use the hilts as a pickaxe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-sword)\n\nYou have to think: With all this ironclad, and chainmail it would be *very* difficult to get any normal sword to pierce through by just hitting the breastplate on the broadside of the sword",
            "It might be a strictly imagined risk by townspeople who never fought, like \"oh what if I actually hit my own neck on the return swing?\". Confidently saying \"double edged swords are more of a liability than an advantage!\", despite having zero real-world experience. Like your common Redditor pretending they know shit.\n\nTownspeople also very-well could have just developed inaccurate terms, just as modern civilians do too. Lot of people call any small-ish machine gun an \"Uzi\" or a magazine a \"clip\" (a clip actually being a device used to load internal or external magazines). Maybe the townspeople actually meant a sword with full-on double blades, envisioning something Darth Maul style as if anyone actually used such weapons? I mean modern civilians make up all sorts of stupid stuff about modern combat, invest in \"tactical tomahawks\" they find on BUDK because they think it's \"military grade\" when actually it's just mall ninja trash not even slightly resembling an actual war-appropriate tool. So that checks out.\n\n\nI'll give you another imagined risk since I don't swordfight: Half-swording is a technique applied against armored targets. You grab the blade around the middle with your non-dominant hand, while keeping your dominant on the handle. Spreading your hands out like this instead of both on the handle, it lets you put more power and better directional guidance into the thrust, letting you drive it home directly onto that sweet spot you're aiming for. But it might be a bit scary to do that on a double-edged sword where there's nowhere to grab that isn't sharp. I mean knights definitely did it without hurting themselves (sword-sharp is far from razor-sharp) but it might still be scary to someone unfamiliar to the technique. Same goes for bracing the sword on your non-dominant hand or arm in a block, doing that on a double edge would be driving an edge right into you as you block someone else's weapon (hypothetically, as to me that just sounds like movie shit).",

            "If you have a wild swingback with a katana, a blunt strip of metal hits you and can hurt you, but won\u2019t cut you, if you do something like that with a double edge sword you get cut.  it\u2019s not that you get cut in the very same instant that the opponent does, it\u2019s in the half second or so so before or after",
