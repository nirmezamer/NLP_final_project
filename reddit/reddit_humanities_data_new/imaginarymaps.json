            "I had a random thought about there being a triangle shaped state and I thought it was funny so I made it. \n\nSohcahtoa is a state in the West named after a Native American tribe with the same name. They were originally part of Mexico, but after the Mexican-American war, the U.S. acquired the land. Over time, it became the most populated state in the U.S., with Los Angles becoming the 2nd largest in the nation.\n\nSohcahtoa is known as the Tri State, due to it containing 3 large metro areas (Angles Coast, Sin City, and Pythagopolis), which contain most of the population and form a triangle across the sparsely populated deserts. Oh and also because the state looks like a triangle...\n\nSohcahtoa host teams for the 4 major sports, and the fan base for each of them have an intense rivalry with Colorado. Colorado is the least popular state in Sohcahtoa, only beating Wyoming slightly since no one lives in Wyoming either way.",

The New English King, Harold V, then negotiated with the Romans for the independance of New England, becoming the New English Kingdom.\n\nSince then the New English Kingdom has reamined independant, despite the efforts of the Ukrainian and Ottoman Empires. Today it has a good relationship with Franco-England.)",
            "Not quite old English, I added a few Greek inspired words. The idea was Anglish, but keep the Greek.\n\nAt\u00e6gerland is an intentional misprlling of Adygay Land.\n\nVenetic is my attempt to make a word for Venetian.",
            "I'm having a stroke trying to read this",
            "Oh thanks!",
            "The lore is based on the OTL Anglo-Saxons who fled to the Byzantine Empire and joined the Varangian Guard. There was an actual Anglo-Saxon colony around the Crimea called 'New England'. \n\nApparently in OP's timeline Harold somehow survives Hastings despite being defeated by William",
            "That's why I put it in English underneath.",
            "There's a conspiracy theory that Harold survived Hastings, and went on to become a hermit. Pretty obviously not the case. I dont think a man as bold and as skilful of a tactican that he was would just go be a hermit.\n\nBut I thought why not combine that with Anglo-Saxons in Crimea for some fun. We don't quite know what happened to them. But I figured if they had a good general to lead off to a good start (and a fair amount of ASB) they could still around."
