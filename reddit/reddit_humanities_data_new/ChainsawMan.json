            "So the three characters all come away with different takes on what just happened. It's important to note that in CSM, when someone is genuinely attracted to someone else, they blush. And the opposite is true, with Fumiko being a great example. She never blushed once when flirting with Denji. Yoru on the other hand blushes throughout the entirety of her appearance this chapter. Even after regaining composure and walking away.\n\nYoru is trying to claim it was a just a moment of passion born out of curiosity while still heavily blushing while talking to Denji and then going in for another kiss..one that seemed more tender than the lustful ones from last chapter. She seems to be falling for Denji but doesn't want to admit it to herself. \n\nDenji once again feels like he is just being used albeit with the caveat that some part of Asa seems to like him. In his last panel in the alleway he's on the ground blushing and in the light as the rain has stopped. It seems like he got part of what he wanted, someone to desire and want him but like the rest of his life it was twisted and not so straight foward.\n\nAsa just witnessed herself making out with Denji and losing the choice to do it herself when she was ready. It's already been shown that she had physical desire for Denji (her rant after the memory block) so the idea that she'd hate  touching/kissing Denji never seemed to track. Moreso she wanted to go at her own pace and Yoru decided to turbo charge it and not understand why Asa would hate her for stealing a romantic moment from her.\n\nAlso the shocked face last chapter  seemed to be Asa coming back through with intense emotion only to be forced back out by Yoru. Their transitions no longer cause huge body jolts like earlier.\n\nTldr, Yoru likes denji but doesn't want to admit it, Asa hates that she lost the chance to choose when to be intimate with Denji and Denji is wondering why all the women in his life are psychos.",

            "I dunno gang, I really feel like Yoru likes Denji more than she knows herself, and is putting all the blame on Asa. She says she only kissed him because it felt good, but as Makima put it, those things feel better the more you know your partner.",
            "My only complaint is that the chapter went by way too fast",
            "Yoru\u2019s in denial, Asa\u2019s flustered, and Denji has absolutely no clarity\n\nActually about what I expected lol. At least we finally started cluing Denji in about War. \nNow we just need Yoshida and Fumiko to ruin the sushi date",

            "That whole \"Asa & Yoru are merging\" theory might've gotten some credibility after this chapter. Usually, Fujimoto draws both Asa & Yoru together whenever they're not around others but here, we can only see ONE of them taking over while the other one stays invisible\n\n\nThis could mean one of two things: either they are slowly merging and this is Fujimoto's way of showcasing that scenario or...both Asa & Yoru are fighting for the dominance of the body & personality.

            "\"I only kissed you because it felt good\". This was supposed to be an excuse for Yoru but it's probably the best thing Denji could've asked to hear. She didn't kiss him to manipulate him or to incapacitate him, it was a kiss of pure affection.\n\nAnd Asa's main complaint about what Yoru did isn't that she didn't consent to it but what Denji will think of her now. But since Denji doesn't actually think anything bad about her and he knows she likes him, could the Asaden ship really set sail? I really hope so.\n\nThe sushi restaurant they went to is called \"Death by Sushi\". I wonder what that's supposed to mean, could we meet the Death Devil in the next chapter? Is it gonna be Kobeni working there as a waitress lol?\n\nThe contrast between the background drawn by an assistant and Denji drawn by Fujimoto is huge in this panel\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ruk89wn4oy5d1.png?width=1013&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=59dfe65d0dba54f64a04557592242458c94607eb",

Then he touched Power's tits but they turned out to be fake. He wanted a kiss, but then Himeno puked in his mouth. He wanted a date, but then Reze bit his tongue off and left. He wanted a relationship but then Makima killed everyone he ever loved.\n\nNow he wants sex, and, just like previously he kind of got what he wanted. But now he realizes he actually wants to be loved, and the girl that actually maybe likes him is trapped behind Yoru. If anything this is kind of the least harmful one.\n\nIf you want to place bets on how a story will go, bet on the continuation of things that have already happened. That's what I do.\n\nIf people still want to read it as Denji getting SAd they certainly can. Though, transparently, I think it's clear that the point of 167 and 168, is just to say: Yoru wants to fuck Denji, Asa wants to fuck Denji but she actually likes him, Denji wants to fuck Asa but as always he is confused -- he thinks it's sex he wants but the desire for sex is a symptom for his underlying desire for companionship. They had a kind of spontaneous, if not over the top and ridiculous, sexual encounter and now things are complicated.\n\nIt's fine. We're fine. Everything's fine.

            "Thoughts:\n\n- Re-read chapter 112: Between Cat and Criminal - this chapter makes a couple callbacks to that one, but with some important changes, so flip through that if you need a refresher\n- Notice how Denji is posed this chapter, especially on page 8 with all the cardboard and trash. Last time, he was the one who'd sold cigs to a homeless man. Now *he's* the homeless man - both in the sense of being literally homeless, but more relevantly, **he's the one who's been \"ripped off\"**. All of these kisses he'd thought were with Asa turned out to be with someone who looks like her and sounds like her, but somehow, isn't her. \"American cigs\".\n- Asa runs to catch up with someone just as they're crossing the line from the dark into the light. Last time, it was to ask Denji out on a date, but this time, it's to war with War. The lighting is drawn inconsistently, but the panels around the point where she says, \"That... hurt! I thought you liked Chainsaw Man! Shouldn't you be happy?!\" show her with her head \"half in shadow\". \n- I'm sure many have already caught on to the punny name of the sushi restaurant. \"Death by Sushi\" - *sushishi* can be rendered as \u5bff\u53f8\u6b7b (sushi-shi, \"sushi death\"). The fact that the flags are advertising fish reproductive parts - [milt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milt) and roe, or testes and ova - likely weren't missed, either. Ch 112 was directly followed by the aquarium, while this chapter directly leads into a sushi restaurant. Establishments full of dead fish.\n\nPoor Denji. He's a pretty simple guy: he likes people who like him (ch 40), and he's also the type to forgive and forget *ridiculously* quickly. So while I'm sure this whole alleyway episode has just added to already tall pile of stuff he's struggling to mentally digest, I don't think he's going to begrudge the fact she sexually assaulted him any more than he'd begrudged Aki, Power, Himeno, Reze, Fumiko, or even Makima for all the shit they'd done to him. Denji's single brain cell is going to hone in on that confirmation that some part of Asa *does* like him, so even though he's been explicitly told that there are multiple \"sides\" to her, I suspect that he still hasn't clued in on what's going on with her scars yet. He has to devote more brain power to it (and get some food in him).\n\nIt's interesting that the first thing Asa takes offense to isn't in how Yoru misused her body. Neither does she seem all that flustered by Yoru repeating the fact that she likes CSM, even though this had been something which embarrassed her before. Asa's angry - and *afraid* - of being seen as a \"slut\", enough to have been able to wrest back control of her body. If Yoru was right, Asa's issue wasn't with killing Bucky, it was how others perceived her for having killed Bucky; analogously, Asa's issue isn't in having kissed (and groped) Denji, it's how she thinks Denji will perceive her for having done so.\n\nConsidering Fumiko's stated love of sushi, and also the way the aquarium incident ended (Yoshida looking up and making eye contact with Famine), I wonder if the group is going to run into them here.\n\nSee you in 2 weeks....",

            "My heart breaks for Denji, he\u2019s so confused right now. And I loved Asa bumrushing Yoru. \u201cThe fuck are doing kissing and grabbing on my man? And with MY body?\u201d",
            "\"Only my other self\"\n\nShe is clearly lying there...",
            "Chapter writeup (essay incoming)\n\nNgl on first read I thought this was a lil underwhelming but we\u2019re actually getting a lot of info about Yoru and Asa. It is cool to get some clarification on characters\u2019a stances on the previous chapter, my reading is that Yoru has indeed been infected by Asa\u2019s feelings and maybe the overall concept of love, she\u2019s blushing the whole chapter, and is completely on the defensive. Immediately after washing her hand, she hardliners that she only kissed denji because it felt good, then stares at him and his mouth, has a thirst expression, then goes for another kiss. I think that sequence is interesting because it does illustrate a kind of desire we hadn\u2019t seen from her before, perhaps an element of weakness contrasting how she was unequivocally on the warpath previously.\n\nDenji asking if she likes him and her responding that she doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s Asa that does and her feelings are flowing into Yoru which is why she\u2019s acting on them is interesting in how the phrasing is probably the literally explanation, but also reads as a deflection, an \u201cI don\u2019t like you, I\u2019ve just literally caught feelings.\u201d\n\nI think it\u2019s a really interesting approach to have Yoru\u2019s character as a horseman contrast the others regarding love and desire. Makima weaponized and inflicted love, certain she couldn\u2019t get it through any other means, and her method of desire sort of existed as her standom for pochita, Nayuta started on a similar path of manipulation before learning to love Dr ju and the pets, though she\u2019s also a spoiled 12-year old punkass who gets what she wants, Fami is\u2026somehow a functional embodiment of gluttony (her literal motivation for fighting the death devil is because humanity=yummy human food), and in that context, Yoru seems the most adolescent of the siblings, denying love but having been infected by it, and having no idea how to handle it or how it interacts with desire.\n\nHonestly I really like this chapter and the previous for how it seems Yoru is suddenly becoming a lot less static self-certain character and has a much more active internal life. That\u2019s not to say that\u2019s all though, Asa has some pretty interesting stuff too.\n\nWe see her for the first time in a while (I guess fuji did forget to draw the scars in that one point last chapter and Yoru didn\u2019t dip after all), and she immediately chooses violence. Self-inflicted violence admittedly, but it is surprising to see Asa slam Yoru into a walk, immediately demand answers, and try to beat up Yoru.\n\nAgain, Yoru opens with another suspect line about only kissing denji to confirm suspicions of having kissed before and defending it on the basis that it felt good (for both of them) which Asa responds to by hitting her/herself with a pretty nice punch. Yoru\u2019s never been physically abusive towards Asa, just zipping her out of her body at times, so it\u2019s interesting to see Asa express so much directed agro and channel her frustration, where earlier in the series she probably would have just masked and yelled at Yoru instead of a direct confrontation like this. Good for her!\n\nComplicating that, I think it\u2019s a really interesting detail that we see Asa\u2019s anger comes from a place of self-image, worry of what people think of her, and prudishness (I find it hilarious that she\u2019s this mad over kissing but seems to have no objection over giving denji a handy, but that\u2019s beside the point abd maybe Fuji Forgor). I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s 1:1, but translated, her main concern is that \u201cHe\u2019ll think I\u2019m a slut now.\u201d\n\nThis really clicked me back in to the first chapter  of part 2 and how her defining \u201cif I could do it all again\u201d monologue paralleling Denji\u2019s in ch1 is about wanting to be more selfish instead of how self-repressed she was in ch1 about wanting meaningful connections, to not be miserable and that like. She\u2019s had a demon living rent-free in her head so we haven\u2019t seen too much of a return to that \u201cwanting to be selfish\u201d angle, so I really like the text of this chapter for her being that Yoru is kind of fulfilling that thematic impulse/desire to love more fully, to act on her emotions and do what she wants to do outside her own inhibitions/squareness.\n\nI\u2019m less sure what to make of Denji in this chapter, the most we get out of him is absolute bewilderment, which I think is warranted. From his perspective, the possibly bipolar/schizo weird girl he went on a date with has given him an amazing amount of mixed messages, from the movie date when she said she hated him then kissed him, wanting to fight him really adamantly and awkwardly trying to help him find Nayuta, to now, where CASTRATION PRANK GONE WRONG (GONE SEXUAL!?) and they have a really intense make out+handy sesh and afterwards she, really flustered, says she only kissed him because it felt good, kisses him again, then says she doesn\u2019t like him, but the other her (interesting word choice) does, and those feeling flowed into her. Wtf is she talking about? Bro has absolutely no idea what\u2019s going on.\n\nJokes aside, it is neat to see that Denji heard, however confusingly it was communicated, that someone does like him. Now that he\u2019s gotten most of his basic needs (nut, affirmation), he can get the last one. Next chapter sushi chapter.\n\nAlso I like this cute lil panel of them both doing a dissociative mouth breather moment\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6y0hp36fyy5d1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cdefa0810215cbdaea4e89a3def0ff770dab41a",

Yoru even considers Asa as a part of herself.

Maybe it represents Denji falling for Asa, and then Asa taking over the body again and reigniting her feelings for Denji. She doesn't deny the kiss felt good.\n\nThe sushi place is hinting at sex/reproduction by the signs out front advertising eggs(the roe) and sperm(milt).

            "just my thoughts (which is no way meant to discredit anyone's feelings towards the last couple of chapters regarding SA) but i think the ch 168 interaction basically confirmed my suspicions about asa's feelings bleeding into yoru's actions. asa doesn't show any disgust toward denji, but toward yoru and herself\u2014asa truly likes denji and is much more distraught over the way \"she\" comes across to him as someone who would not act on her romantic and sexual feelings so spontaneously. we learn from the very first chapter she's introduced that asa is insecure, socially inept, and cares a great deal about how she's perceived. she has moments of arrogance and selfishness, thinks she's better than others, but at the end of the day, like most teenagers, she craves companionship and validation. denji craves these things, too, and he's faced again with a girl who seems like she's just using him. thankfully he's at least given the hint that there's more than meets the eye here with the dual identity thing, but it's probably something that won't click right away given his past experiences and traumas. \n\ni might be reading too deep into this, but i think yoru in part embodies asa's shadow, as carl jung describes it, \"the thing a person has no wish to be.\" as asa's influence grows stronger in their shared existence, yoru, who is a devil with no regard for humans and their customs or what is socially and morally acceptable to them, facilitates the expression of asa's repressed emotional state.\n\nanyway i loved the ch and feel like the fallout is quite realistic! rooting for asa and denji's happiness ahhhh",
