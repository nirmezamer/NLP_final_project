            "Seems like Jodio mixing up three letter acronyms wasn't just a one off joke when he was talking about music with Charmingman",
            "I like the part where Jodio explains what the fuck an mri is",
            "Oh my god that last scene is incredible. They effectively got her killed as a mechanism to bring the land to them. I'm glad we are already setting up that using the rock means potential sacrifices being made, and that the gang will be willing to accept progressively worse consequenses to achieve it. This is the best chapter in a while.",
            "The Jodio pose on the cover page is insane. It's like he broke all of his limbs",
            "When they first showed the land registry woman in the hospital I thought it was Holly for a second lol",
            "Stand name discovered: Bags' Groove, a Miles Davis album.\n\nEDIT: Well, not sure whether we should go with song or album...\n\nEDIT THE SECOND: It was actually composed by Milt Jackson (it's jazz). Davis was the one behind its most famous rendition.",
            "Smooth operators shrunk to fit in Dragona's windpipe!! Stand shrinking is back!!!1!",
            "Jodio yelling \"There's a sequence Dragona!\" while Dragona is on the floor dying is so funny",
            "Seems like the greater the price (or harder to get in possession of) of the thing they\u2019re trying to steal is the greater the price other people will have to pay to get it to them. Like the few dollars made it right to them with no worry, that 80k watch had the guy who bought it lose the money he spent and had his girl leave him, and this 50 billion dollar land got someone killed. \n\nI can see this over time leading to something like one of the main characters getting killed off for a extremely large some of cash and completely regretting it. Something like Jodio finally becomes filthy rich like he wanted but at the price of losing dragona, someone Jodio would probably consider to be priceless. Giving him the maximum reward for maximum price.\n\n\nGreat chapter. I know we\u2019re already 16 chapters in but it still feels weird when new characters get introduced",
            "I\u2019m really enjoying the pacing here. Jojo is usually infamous for taking its time to introduce new characters. \n\nBut Araki just dropped an entire folder of them on our asses.",
            "\"All you have to do is operate a computer!\"\n\nThere's never been a JoJo gang I've trusted to do this less.\n\nJodio: \"I pushed ICU not MRI.\"\n\nYup.",
            "I gotta say, November Rain's precision is insane. \n\nAlso really liking the design of the new villains. I like how Araki subverts the expectation by making us think the hat-wearing guy was the stand user, when it was in fact the girl.",
            "Insane chapter actually.\n\nHowler is looking more and more like the main villain group. To be expected from a King Crimson reference.",
            "Other note: The investigator accompanying the User of Bags' Groove, Bobby Jean, is named for a Bruce Springsteen song. (I was still too late to warn the comments section on YouTube...)",
            "Really into the suspicious crooked investigator and vaguely freakish little girl combo, and I LOVE that the girl is the stand user. The way Araki plays with expectations has always been one of my favorite things about his writing.\n\nEverything about JOJOLands has been so interesting to me, and I love how the threads are all compounding. The mysteries about Howler and the lava rock are really intriguing, and I get so excited every time we learn more. And as always, I\u2019m obsessed with the crew\u2019s dynamic. Meryl Mei\u2019s little gang are wildly fun, and their interactions are some of my favorites for any cast in the series.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to add that I really really love how strong Jodio and Dragona\u2019s relationship is. The fact that Jodio tends to come off pretty aloof and blas\u00e9, but very obviously loves his big sibling really gets me. Sure hope nothing bad ever happens to them.",
            "\"I need you Usagi.\"\n\nThe Usagi x Dragona fanbase stays winning.\n\nAlso Bags' Groove's user is probably part of the Howler family; seems like she's wealthy and influential. The man with her must be a high-ranking police officer being paid of by the Howlers. Seems like they have influence over the entire state.",
            "\"I can't take money, that isn't allowed\"\n\nmaybe I'm reaching with this but if the Milagro Man is back I will SCREAM\n\nalso there seems to be a recurring theme of three-letter acronyms? Charming Man will only listen to three-letter artists (SZA, HER, etc), and Jodio gets confused between ICU and MRI...",
            "I like Jodio noting the word \"absurd\" once again. Interesting how it keeps coming up; I wonder where it's going, as well.",
            "First arc's main villains are here, let's go!",
            "Will the rock human teases ever stop?",
            "i deadass thought that the daughter of the politician in the hospital was Holly Kira and almost shit my pants",
            "I love how the enemy stands are created, They feel like they are created for the team to fight instead of being cool facts araki learnt on Wikipedia",
            "I'm convinced every JoJolion fan had a feeling crawling on their back when the hospital was mentioned",
            "Looks like the situation's getting complicated, I like it, I'm curious to see where these new guys fit in. \nMy only worry is the amount of characters Araki is has introduced already in such a short time, I hope he can make all of them feel cohesive with one another.",
            "This feels like the kid's are going to regret doing what they just did. I'm not entirely sure why they did it but...",
            "Bobby Jean is a reference to the song \u201cBobby Jean\u201d by Bruce Springsteen from the Born in the U.S.A album",
            "I instinctively read Bobby Jean's dialogue with a Texas accent",
            "This chapter was a great showing for Jodio. Their desperation in trying to save Dragona was sweet. But it also showed Jodio\u2019s intelligence when he coordinated with Dragon to take out the enemy Stand.\n\nPlus, Jodio and Dragona made such a great sibling team once Dragona recovered. I definitely like this relationship being fleshed out as the story goes on.\n\nWe also finally see our Stand user. At first the chapter tried to depict the agent as the user, but it\u2019s the young lady instead. The Stand name appears to be Bag\u2019s Groove. Also, it seems like Araki knows people are trying to sniff out Rock Humans among the cast, because he is throwing in teases every so often. This time, with the lady talking like she\u2019s not a human.",
            "So the entire end sequence was the Lava Rock guiding them toward the Land ? That's just so sick. This part is insane.\n\nThe entire chain reaction is kind of nuts. Jodio messing up a 3 letters acronyme, the girl dying, meaning the computer with the contract is now free to access. Just insane.",
            "I have a wacky prediction, the gang will somehow get implicated in the murder of Congressman's daughter putting the entire state of Hawaii on their ass. Again just a wacky thought with nothing backing it.",
            "The seizure of Howler's land is going to backfire big-time somehow. I'm not sure how it will, but it's going to have grave consequences, I'm sure of that.",
            "This has been a fantastic day for me. New Jojo Chapter, New Ippo Chapter, a 10/10 Nintendo Direct. \n\nI could not be happier :)",
            "That November Rain/Smooth Operators combo attack was sick",
            "Shohei Ohtani got mentioned in this chapter! Aside from that, this chapter has Araki's strongest writing in part 9 so far; the climax in the hospital is executed perfectly to convey the mechanism in action, as well as its increasingly large exchanges",
            "November rain may have what seems like a simple power, but it keeps showing new layers. it managed to hit the inside of Dragonas body with pinpoint precision. sure, it was really cool combination attack with smooth operators holding them down, but it was still an impressive feat. \n\nand we finally meet members of the villain group, and they are pretty interesting. it seems like the agent bobby Jean is a corrupt cop, since hes affiliated with the tiny girl whose stand is attacking them. I wonder if hes going to survive the stand users defeat and be a recurring villain, or if hell reveal a stand he uses to defend her",
            "Smooth Operators is quickly becoming one of my favorite stands, those little guys are awesome",
            "And just like that, Araki will create a new generation of jazz fans.         \nSmooth Operators is such a versatile Stand, one of the best in Jojo and one I would love to have in real life.          \nI think the girl is the daughter of the owner of Howler.         \nOne moment she was so cute and the next she went into serious mode.         \nKids in Jojo are another level.",
            "Jodio bout to throw hands with a child in a few chapters\u00a0\n\nSeriously though: out of all the people I expected to be the enemy stand user, a little girl was not one of them. Also, a lot of characters too. I\u2019m expecting that Bobby Jean guy to be a reoccurring character in the future",
            "Seems like the Howlers are going to be a sort of mashup between the Higashikata family & Passione, and guessing we've only just now met one of them of many to come. This translation at least also implies that she's some sort of Rock Human-like character (her references to \"humans\")?\n\nIt's been true throughout the series, but it continues to be funny that so many characters act like they & everyone else on their team just has an encyclopedic knowledge of Stands, despite most normal people not having any clue that they exist. Like, once you awaken your Stand, you gain access to Jojowiki. Jodio immediately starting to babble about \"long-range automatic pursuit-type\" Stands as if this was a concept & a system of classification that everybody around just knows about is just funny to me, and I doubt we'll ever get an in universe explanation for it (and I don't need one either, I just find it amusing).",
            "Not a soul in this world was expecting Bags' Grooves Araki really played us all",
            "JoJolands' story is starting in the place where JoJolion's ended.",
            "I really loved the part where Jodio screamed \" it's JoJolanding time\" and acquired the JoJolands.",
            "Fantastic chapter. Really liking our new villains. What happened to poor Sophie wasn't their intention or their fault, but still the way it went down was hella cold at the end.",
            "High af. But theories:\n\nHowler seems to be aware of the theft of the lava rock after the cats got killed. Higher ups call agent Bobby Jean, when he arrives they have him bring the girl to review footage of team jojo looking at rhe documents as her stand was activated. \n\nLittle girl is def a daughter of a higher up.",
            "\n\nHands down the best Chapter we've had in months (not that the others are bad, this was just the best one!) WOW! I for SURE thought Dragona was a goner, I was audibly saying \"NO NO NO\" as I was reading- fuck Jodio is REALLY stepping up. He is such a great JoJo.  \nAlso Bobby Jean? Nice with some Bruce Springsteen!!  \nThat Bobby Jean guy seems like he's going to be something more than just the \"next arcs villain\" , REALLY excited about that!!!\n\n Also Bag's Groove's user... I know we way this every four weeks but... the way she is dressed , and the way she speaks about humans... she doesn't seem quite \"Human\" herself... I KNOW we say this ALL the time guys but this time I PROMISE! I PROMISE IT'S A ROCK HUMA- \\*gets forcefully dragged off-stage by three security guards\\*",
            "Alright! Another unexpected and unique use of a stand assed to my list!\n\n. Dragona shrinks Smooth Operators to get a member of Bags' Groove captive, then Jodio uses November Rain to obliterate the mate with a raindrop",
            "Bags Groove. Interesting stand name.\n\nCan't wait to see the gang work an MRI machine.\n\nCrying for Sophie.",
            "I don\u2019t want to make any hard judgments either way, but I feel like Jojolands is already leagues ahead of golden wind in terms of execution of a large evil corporation conspiracy type plot. The tension and action scenes that just weave into each other are really great, and the team fits nicely without seeming overly friendly (except the flirting lol). \n\n\nI hope it keeps this pace and direction moving forward and doesn\u2019t fall back on the random SA scenes like the first few chapters.",
            "Damn that fake out on who the stand user was fooled me. I also like the part where Jodios November Rain snipes Bags Groove. That was insane.",
            "Lol spilling the ramen came back.  Nothing is a coincidence when the lava rock is involved",
            "Man every few chapters this part just reinvigorates me to keep reading. Loving the concept and design of the old guy and the girl. Feels fresh compared to the insane designs from previous parts. More down to earth but distinct. \n\nWhile I\u2019d rather not have another automatic stand, I do like the user actually takes damage from direct attacks instead of being clueless of what\u2019s going on. She\u2019s going to be an active part of the pursuit as she\u2019s looking for these random people who activated her Stand.\n\nHope this pacing keeps up and we don\u2019t get the problem where characters panic and repeat themselves for several pages across chapters.",
            "So\u2026 that child is the stand user?",

            "wtf is up with that kid",

            "I love seeing the Kirkland brand characters made by  The Matte Kudasai",
            "I love Bobby Jean's design",
            "Why did the girl's stand being damaged give her a nosebleed? Aren't automatic pursuit stands typically not linked to the user?",

            "It's a while away, but I can see the anime of this playing out in my head lmao.",
            "The stands in this part are reminiscent of the ones in Part 4 & 5 in how useful they are when it comes to situations where you need to be agile.\n\nIn fact, with the likes of Smooth Operators, Matte kudasai & November Rain, they've shown to be more utility based.",
            "Here my dumbass believed that Usagi spilled the ramen on purpose for a big brain play but nah dude was just hungry",
            "so if the lava rock set up that whole situation with the woman dying, does that mean it also caused jodio to press the wrong button? lmao",
            "It really was an *endless calamity*!!",
            "I really liked that chapter! The stand complication is cool, the new villains are really good, I dig them a lot. And I love that they basically let that daughter die to get that land. It feels like the main story really starts to pull in. Generally the part has for my feeling a really fast pacing, much more than part 7 and 8. Feels really like a reinterpretation of part 5, which was also a quite fast paced one.",
            "Damn, what a riveting chapter! That security camera room scene was great, the interactions with the characters felt so natural! I wonder who that young girl could posssibly be...\n\nWe know that she's the enemy stand user, but there's a bit more to her character that meets the eye...",
            "Was usagi able to see the stand initially because of a stand user, like psychic perception within your body? or did he know about that stand already? either way this panel specifically caught my eye, how it's drawn with the perception of the stand then stated that he \"saw\" it, but something doesn't add up there.",
            "Ngl I don't quite understand what they did with the fingerprint at the end there, but I'm hyped for what's happening \n\n\nAlso of course Usagi spilling the ramen was plot relevant and came back to bite them in the ass. Because of fucking course it was lol",
            "You guys i lovs Jojolands already. These comments here as so funny\ud83d\ude02. The girl who wanted the hulla hoop doll was so creepy",
            "Wait they\u2019re talking about Shohei right when the congressman was talking about her daughter mentioning Ohtani?",
            "i'm so glad we actually got a butt load of new characters this chapter. nothing wrong with a small cast, but jojo's is infamous for being slow with introducing characters. so the fact we went from several chapters about one character to (at minimum, depending on who you find \"important\") three characters at once makes me so excited.",
            "watch her be like 33 years old",
            "I really like seeing Araki play with his main casts morality so much in the last 3 parts.",
            "Huh, a spherical attack that dug a perfect hole through an opponent for instant effect.\n\nThat the user could remote control to hit a specific target. . .\n\nWhere have I seen that before. . .",
            "The Hula Nyan Dancer got a suspicious amount of focus, and no information can be found about it online. It's going to be important later. My theory is there's a lava rock or other important item hidden inside.",

            "Using November Rain that way was so freaking cool. I knew there was going to be a unique way he'd use it especially in such a tight space. Even if he technically did >!spit in his broster's mouth!<",
            " No, not Tooru reincarnated as a loli !\n\nWell, our newest Stand User isn\u2019t 100% like Tooru, but she does seem to be in it for the long haul\u2014all humans eventually die, but presumably she won\u2019t? Long lived or immortal. Crap, maybe she\u2019s Kars reincarnated into a loli. \n\nNice reminder that The Mattekudasai can only transform into one thing at a time, and the Smooth Operators/November Rain combo was awesome.",

            "Probably practiced the Scrubs dance before it was cool.",
            "Really good parallel with Part 5's \"resolve\", doing whatever it takes to get something done. Except instead of sacrificing themselves for a noble cause, unless something changes, uh... Things will get worse.",
            "Yeah compare this to Jotaro and Josuke who would just into action or vow to beat the crap outta the guy who did this to her. They take the opportunity to move that mechanism along",
            "I'm right in interpreting it that what happened is that they completed the document that meant that the land was seized by the state (it was the official's fingerprint smooth operators pulled over and pressed, right?) It's not theirs yet, but this is one obvious step in a chain of events that leading to them getting it (I think some folks in their first reactions assumed it was one of the gang's fingerprints they pulled onto the document verification thingie, thus transferring the land directly to them, but that doesn't make much sense, imo)",

            "I somewhat expect Sophie will survive, figure out what happened (with her Stand awakening around this time, with or without anti-Bags' Groove capabilities), and force Jodio's retinue to allow her to assist.

I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. When fully erect, my penis is 6 inches long. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."
