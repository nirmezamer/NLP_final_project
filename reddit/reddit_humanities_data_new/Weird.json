As for the cologne, he is likely to detect the smell of his own sweat more easily and in far lower quantities than most people would be able to.

I'd imagine any nursing staff would take their own sharps back out for disposal (hopefully) but home health agencies can really be expensive when you have limited resources and I know often family members will be trained in changing dressings and whatnot to reduce the number of nurse visits they need. My mom is a home health nurse and has a lot of low-income patients that she helps out off the books, a lot of these people truly have no resources and very weak support systems but one way to save money is to train them to do everything they can manage for themselves. The conditions our disabled, elderly, and injured live in are frequently not ideal unfortunately. She had one patient for years that became a family friend and my mom would take me and her daughter on little outings just to give mom and young teenage daughter a break because they were living in a motel room and very infrequently had any outside contact (I think the daughter went to school, but her mom was bedridden for the most part so over the summer they were constantly in very close quarters with one another but completely isolated from the outside world).",
