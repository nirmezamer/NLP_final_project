Glovebox receipts it was last run in 2001/02 and we bought it spring 2009. Dad's mechanic gave it a tune up and once over then it was mine to drive. Weeks later knowing it had sat so long I did an oil change thinking I was smart. Growing up anything dad owned with 100K+ miles got a can of Restore with oil change.

When I lifted them off there was a wee pile of sticky grainy crap lying at the bottom presumably where stuff had been washed along the middle of the rocker shaft and dropped through the oil holes.",

            "Hey - I'd love to talk to you more about this for an article in Carscoops... Hit me up if you'd like. \n\nThis is wild either way.   \n24.8 Hrs is ridiculous lol Good on you for cracking it in less than 15",
            "With that level of tear down, do you take it out for some kind of buzz, squeak, rattle test drive? I've seen the test tracks at a number of assembly plants. Curious if shops have any kind of prescribe test drive.\n\nNinja edit: awesome work too. Couldn't believe that other post. I was on team duct tap and ipad. Wild.",
            "Awesome job,, congrats.\n\nA full interior is not for the faint of heart. If it's more than a few years old a lot of plastic does not cooperate.",
            "I refuse to believe that interior won't make noise after this.  I'm glad they paid you more than 1.5hrs!",
            "Just an anecdote because of the rogue screw. Recently saw a wrangler with the bed off and the back of the cab had a run almost from end to end. Super low mileage. I\u2019ve seen some small factory runs but this was a doozy. \n\nEnjoy the ice pops.",
            "That\u2019s awesome, when the warranty Adminstrator submits the claim\u2026. It will be rejected.  Hopefully they won\u2019t back flag you.  You deserve every bit of that 24hrs.  But it will be rejected, overlap city.",
            "Good on you OP!",
            "Did you hide that 9mm for the next time?",
            "That is a ridiculous amount of labor. Should've considered it totaled, lol. I can see the form now. Reason for vehicle totality: rear entertainment screen no longer working.",
            "Don't tell how fast you did it publicly. Ever. That's what gets labor times dropped. Pretty sure it took you 30 hours... nudge nudge wink wink...",
            "At least you didn\u2019t have to pull the headliner.  But full interior out it wouldn\u2019t be to bad.  I always liked doing interior work on new cars.  Good job.",

            "Aren't you required to clock a certain percentage of the billable hours? I thought FCA was usually 75% for defined labor operations and 100% for diagnostic straight time.\u00a0",
            "OP ,what was the component that needed replacing?? I mean I\u2019ve pulled many dashes and partial interiors but never a full gut like that \u2026",
            "Are yall instructed to run the clock during research sessions. In my field we clock everything from the time we acknowledge a discrepancy notification to the time we clear it I. The system. And to be specific only time spent doing anything related to correcting the issue",
            "I have the same Cornwell trim tool. Love it",

            "Congrats on a job well done.",
            "I have one of these on lease for a year now. Grand Wagoneer.   It's pretty decent.  The only thing is riding in back I was surprised the ride is not better, for the cost of the vehicle.  Riding in front is decent. The back seat ride is not good",
            "This past week I paid $3500 USD for 15 billable hours of work. The problems were: Valve cover gasket replacement, front cover gasket replacement, thermostat replacement, upper intake gasket  replacement, and lower intake gasket replacement. I wouldn't want that bill if it was out of pocket.",

            "Autoevolution pays well if you need a side gig, but they are in Romania so you gotta be up early",
            "Yeah we have some pretty rough roads near by I\u2019ll road test on",
            "Completely possible for a dealer tech that knows the brand. I would do dash rattles on Allantes, a three day job, not one extra bolt, but the core of the dash was like every other GM product, and if you knew it you knew it. You know how their clips work, where they fasten things, you just get in a groove.",
            "Interior work on new stuff really isn\u2019t bad at all. It sucks on something a decade old though.",
            "Quiet for now lol.",
            "Dude this isn't amateur hour. When your at a dealer and making it you become good. \n\nI could rebuild GM transmissions all day without busting a sweat. I literally never messed up towards the end of my stint there. And that includes getting it out and putting it together and reinstall. \n\nIt's the nature of the beast. Otherwise you won't make it. Gotta beat the book too.",
            "Really depends on the dealership's status. Every dealership is treated differently based on different metrics.\u00a0",

            "Couple of rollers from a pinion bearing!",
            "Costs manufacturer probably around 100-150/hr. That's less than 4k in labor on an expensive shitbox",
            "I meant I worked 14 hour days to get it done \ud83d\ude09",
            "Definitely a lot nicer when they\u2019re newer. Headliner was supposed to be dropped, but I flat rated it.",
            "I would have ate that pink starburst.\u00a0",
            "100% of everything if you want diag and straight time. Which I did. We are what\u2019s called a premium level dealer so we don\u2019t have to run time on regular repairs. Only if we\u2019re trying to get extra time diagnostic or straight time. If you are a bass dealer or lower you do you have to run 60%?",
            "Complete harness. Flat rated the headliner intersection so I didn\u2019t have to pull that all the way down.",
            "We can try but they usually kick the time. We have to have a supporting story for everything you did to get paid on it. And they still usually try and kick it.",

            "2013 Chevy Camaro. V6. The quote was for 15 hours at a $199.95 labor rate. At a Chevy dealership. The parts weren't expensive as most were gaskets. That work seemed out of bounds for what I can do. I could have attempted the thermostat(have changed one on a 2015 Jeep Wrangler) but it is on the back passenger side of the engine and I felt if they were taking it apart anyway, it would be best if they fixed it. Plus I didn't feel it was a great idea to drive the 30 minutes back home with a bad thermostat. \n\nThe biggest charges were for the thermostat at $880 USD and the front cover gasket at $1620 USD. If we had strung the work together over multiple visits, it would have cost $4470 USD. I assume the savings is due to having the parts already off for other work but I am unsure. \n\nIt boiled down to this:\n\nValve cover gasket $950 (3.7 hours)\n\nFront cover gasket $1620 (7.5 hours)\n\nFront crankshaft seal $90 (.5 hours)\n\nThermostat $880 (2 hours. 1 hour diag)\n\nUpper intake gasket $355 (quote didn't say)\n\nLower intake gasket $350 (quote didn't say)",

            "Without a doubt. That\u2019s what happened to me. I\u2019ve done more body harnesses than all the other techs at my shop combined.",
            "As I throw up in my mouth I\u2019ll say the oilers. Huge la fan so if they win at least we were put out by the champions. Seriously my least favorite teams.\nCan\u2019t stand Matthew Tkachuk so anything to keep him from winning lol. \nNot sad seeing PLD go. Would have liked to see him play to his potential though. Cool to see Darcy come back. \nMore curious to see how Jim Hillars gonna run the team. Still defensively or play more to the forwards. \nReally want to see Kopi and Drew get one more cup!",

            "We had an older guy that could rebuild them, but Rolls insisted we just throw them out. Those systems were insane, most of the underside middle of the car is this huge hydraulic ram buffered by the accumulators. Later they switched to nitrogen accumulators and as far as know those simply couldn\u2019t be rebuilt. \n\nAlways the damn red \u201cbrake pressure 1\u201d and or \u201c2\u201d lights on solid and 5,000 pounds of car you can barely stop."
