        "content": "[Here](https://www.mythicmap.com) is the website.\n\nObservation: I have asked for permission to make this post.\n\nMythic Map is a website that suggests games based on similarity.\nMy goal is to help people find meaningful game suggestions while increasing the visibility of the great games out there.\n\n~~Currently it only supports Steam games. This will change in the future (probably).~~\n\nEdit (02/08/2023): Things have been sorted out and from now on I will be adding non-Steam games -hopefully- daily. Some switch games are in there now, like Zeldas and Pokemons.\n\nIt also checks daily for what is currently on sale on steam (some sales might be missing \\- if I check at 8AM and a sale spawns at 4PM, the website will only be aware of the new sale the next day). I might try adding other sales sources in the future.\n\nAlso, some suggestions might be a little strange, but keep in mind that different players might be looking for different traits in games, so I have to cast a broad net. An example is Skyrim, where a good portion of the suggestions are not open world RPGs, but instead are games that have a big modding/user created content community. \nStill, if you feel a game is missing or is completely out of place, do not hesitate to tell me about it \\- you can send me an email at [mythicmap.dev@gmail.com](mailto:mythicmap.dev@gmail.com) or maybe post about it in the comments.\n\nEdit (05/07/2023): After a couple of months, I have finally implemented most the fixes/features suggested in the comments! The new version might have some bugs or issues, so if you find any, please tell me about it. Same goes for features.\nMeanwhile, I'll keep working on some ideas I have for the website.\n\nEdit (09/14/2023): I thought it would be cool to find games based on other types of entertainment. My tests were done on anime and they ended up being serviceable, but I'm not very happy with the cross-category suggestions and it might take a while until I figure it out, but when I'm done, Mythic Map will start suggesting things based on movies, series and maybe books.\n\nHope it helps!",

Total number of steam reviews is 441, all reviews incl. third parties is 479 and all positive only is 388. So the 366 you give may be only the positive reviews from buyers on steam instead of all reviews (negative + positive)?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObservation: some games come up twice\n\nE.g. when I've searched for Hegemony 3 the game Total War Shogun 2 comes up twice with identical entries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObservation 3: it's not possible to sort by review score\n\nMaybe just add this sort option or even better create a rating like steamdb that factors in both the steam user rating and the number of reviews\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObservation 4 - \"similar\" games not neccessarily very similar at all?\n\nI searched Europa Universalis 4 and the most similar game (ranked by popularity) according to you is Risk of Rain 2, which is... a completely different genre!?

            "This is epic!!",
            "This works really well. The first thing I tested it on was Vvisual novels, because Steam's recs perform woefully on those; it performs the way you'd want it to, like for any other game, although of course it can only return a limited selection. Wonderful job. I also threw a few unique games in there, including a Chinese game, and it did a good job of pulling up diverse games, which is what you'd want (since, as you said, players like different traits from each game).\n\nYou might not want to share the data sources behind it, but is it using very different sources for non-Steam games? This is super nitpicky, but it could probably perform a little better on games like *Animal Crossing*, which tend to be games players on discussion sites (and in listicles) overwhelmingly seem to seek out for a few focused traits (atmosphere, some gameplay things like customisation and decor). That's a subjective thing, and sourcing preferences in that way might be tricky.\n\nYou could also argue the problem is that *Animal Crossing* defined the territory it's in, including the visuals, much like *Harvest Moon* and thus *Stardew Valley* defined a lot of farming games (and most branching out is just into tropical/witchy things, there are only a few dark ones, yet many genres aren't dissimilar). That's very related to why players seek out games with the same vibe as Animal Crossing; the gameplay is deeply coupled with the aesthetic, and most people wouldn't look for arcane recs to break with convention, plus the objectives are self-determined (collectible/customisation game), which means there'll be less coverage of that in articles. Yet the vibe itself consists of many more random elements (the island/pastoral setting and emphasis on nature, the farming stuff, the friendliness, the anthropomorphic animals, the dressup stuff, the relaxed real-time gameplay, etc.).\n\nI noticed it performs way better on *Animal Crossing: New Leaf* than *New Horizons*, though. I'm not sure if that's its release circumstances (Switch, 2020 vs. 3DS, 2012-2013) or how it was received. ACNH received a LOT of coverage early in the pandemic and was popular with a huge section of the population etc., but ACNL was a huge success only in its niche (and in attracting people to it).\n\nIts recs for ACNL are squarely within the same vibe or gameplay loops. Its recs for NH are deeply focused on the island theme and deprioritise a lot more similar games (the ACNL recs are great, some of the things are out of order but like, if you scroll, this tool works perfectly). On the other hand, you could argue that any ACNH player looking for another cute game should just scroll past anything with art or a title that looks dark lol\n\nBut that's the *one* flaw I noticed with it, and it's trivial; you might consider this done, and that'd be 100% valid even if it weren't so good. I only shared this because I think your tool is interesting and I'm amazed you got it to work so well, and I wanted to think about why it works the way it does. It's really, really good. Thank you for sharing (and as a Nintendo/PC player, thanks for adding non-Steam games; it's also great because a lot of Steam AAs/indies have Switch ports).",

            "My impression is that this works best if you enter 2 or 3 games you like and then take the intersection of results. I.e. run single games through the search, and then correlate the games that are in common between the list of 200 games you get back each time.\r  \n\r  \nIt would be nice if the site could do that for you instead of you having to do all that work yourself.",

My wife is an archivist, and I'm interested in archiving at least the memory of games, because I grew up in the Coleco era. There are a lot of terms we used to use to describe games that we no longer use, such as \"action-adventure,\" and I feel like the field of video games journalism can't match the genre diffusion of video games themselves.\n\nI had the thought at one point to have a dataset that would include not just readily accessible metadata, like what genre a game would call itself, what magazines said, and so on, but also the result of a meta analysis that could roughly identify a collection of what we gamers call \"mechanics.\" Essentially, I'm thinking it might be worth going back and looking at the development of video games with finer granularity, now that we've seen it once already.

But the purpose of the count is so the user can ballpark the popularity of the game, so precision is not really the goal.\n\n2) Steam for some reason has 2 entries for Total War Shogun 2 (id 34330 and id 201270), so my algorithm suggested both. I will get it fixed eventually.\n\n3) I thought about doing it, but decided against it at the time. Just found a blog post about how SteamDB does it, so I will try to implement it at some point.\n\n4) Yes, they are not necessarily on the same genre. The thing is that each game has 200 suggestions (an arbitrary number I chose and might change in the future), so when you sort by popularity it sorts those 200 games by number of reviews. \n\nThe algorithm makes some very loose assumptions like if you search for a very well received game (like Europa Universalis 4) you might want some other very well received games. Of course, this is one of many factors as to why RoR is in there. \n\nI believe this generality is important to the overall results of the system. That being said, this can be easily changed by either manually penalizing RoR or by resampling some data (which I'll do).",

I still need to figure out a layout that has all the functionalities of the desktop version. I will probably revamp the front when I'm done including games from consoles and stuff.",

Genres and tags would be somewhat strange because right now I'm working on adding other distributors and platforms and the way they tag their games is inconsistent. Unifying those kinds of things is a nightmare.\n2. The idea for the search suggestions was to give an easily recognizable game for someone who has just landed into the page and has no idea of what to search for.

            "Thanks for the info, mate. Appreciated, and great work on that site, by the way. Steam should hire you for their recommendation, you're doing a far better job !",
            "Yeah that makes perfect sense actually.  Though I suppose to get around it you could add a column for 'similarity score' which would indicate that high ranked games aren't necessarily the closest match, when sorting by rating.",

            ">and yes steam obviously has never made a serious attempt to make this\n\nBelieve it or not but Steam used to be spot on with its suggestions, especially the \"more like this\" at the bottom of a gamepage. And at some point they started pushing AAA titles and the like very hard. About the same time the search bar started being weighted towards popular titles even when you type in a game name exactly. So yes they had it already but someone higher up decided a bad recommender was more profitable.",

            "Wait, can I embed media from steam? sounds like the kind of thing that would get me in trouble, but if steam is publicly ok with that, then things are simpler.\n\nIdeally, monetization would be done by partnering up with other distributors and getting a commission on sales. This is the first thing I will try, so the stores I add will be the ones that accepts partnership and are not doing funky stuff like reselling steam keys or whatever.",

            "Damn, steampeek really uses steam's CDN. Not sure if that's legal and if steam cares, but I would rather avoid it for now.\n\nNot sure if stores are willing to partner up. When I say \"reselling keys\" I am talking about unauthorized key resellers and authorized key resellers exist."

This table is all automated based on the list of games I maintain, so let me know if theres more info that would be good to see in it.\n\nUnfortunately, as I found out, something broke between the summer sale and today, so it didn't properly pull out the New games from the list - Hence the delay. I set up the New Game Table manually, so none of the fancy prices, review percentage, or things go with it right now, but I'll update it once I fix the pipeline that gets the data from my database\n\n It now features a neat Table that can be filtered and sorted in all sorts of ways to help with discoverability (since markdown tables are not good for that). [You can find the table here](https://ncdb.prosperitea.net/dashboard/#/nc/view/e7c1fbae-6048-456a-9a2e-8652ba9ffe03)\n\n---\n\n**Big News though** - In the future, this thread will morph into a website of it's own. Ive been building a 'hidden gem discoverability platform' that will let you slice and dice the entire steam catalog by a ton of attributes, including the number of reviews, release dates, steam deck compatibility, genre tags, and more. Its a tool I started to help me find games for this list, so I figured with some polish, I could throw it up for anyone else to use.\n\nI was hoping to launch it today, but the UX is still a WIP. Just be on the watch for it soon ;)\n\n---\n\n**TL:DR** - Out of the 100 games on the Master List there are:\n\n- 3 new games on the list\n\n- 86 on sale\n\n- 64 games over 50% off\n\n- 51 games with a review score of 90% or Higher\n\n- 11 games with Overwhelmingly Positive Reviews\n\n- 7 early access games \n\n- 30 Steam Deck Verified games \n\n- 13 games have demos\n\n\n---\n\n** New Games**\n\n---\n\n\n\nName | Description | Genre | Link\n----|-----------|-----|----\nIslets | I honestly thought I had this on the list since it launched, but Islets is a short (~8 hours) cozy metroidvania that doesn't overstay its welcome.

It's a metroidvania-katamari-darksouls mix (with a heavy dose of Getting Over it) where you'll have to reshape yourself constantly to try and make your way up a vertical world. There are checkpoints (unlike GOI), and the metroidvania-like growth actually works super well with the \"fall back down through the world\" element, since it allows you to gather powerups/collectibles that you couldn't the first time through. A sort of \"accidental backtracking\". It's got programmer art and sound, but is very much still worth playing IMO. \n\nIt left the biggest impression on me of any indie game I played this year.",

It is a multiplayer medieval combat game with an **insane learning curve**. Even though I was being slaughtered every match for the first 200 hours, I always found myself crawling back, craving the high of punching a fully armored knight to death with my bare hands as a naked gremlin. Or spending countless hours creating the perfect knight. Finding the most effective builds. \n\n**Enter the Gungeon** is another one that leached away my life. At first I wasn't a fan. I actually only recently went back to it. That game is THE definition of **addictive gameplay**. It's a roguelike where you explore the Gungeon collecting guns and items that make you stronger. Every run is a lottery ticket, and you are always in the mentality of \"This run will be the one.\"\n\n**Voices of the Void** is as **immersive** as it gets. You are a researcher living alone at a research station in the middle of the woods. Your job is to collect signals and look for alien life. The gameplay loop is basically collect signals, buy stuff, collect more signals, buy more stuff. I'm not going to spoil much more but the atmosphere of that game is amazing. It's also free! Highly recommend.\n\n**Rogue Fable 4** is the newest in the series and what I love about it is that you can pick it up and play at any time. It is a turn-based 2D roguelike where you go deeper down a randomly generated dungeon. You get to choose a class and a race that each have their own powers/abilities. As it is turn-based you can literally **exit at any moment throughout your run** and it will automatically save your progress. It also has a free version that you can play in your browser to see if you like it or not. The paid version obviously having more features that is also being actively developed.",

            "I also have adhd, so here\u2019s some games that have been able to keep my attention for quite some time with the amount of hours I\u2019ve played them so far: \n\nValheim (around 60 hours. Fun building, kinda grindy, but even the grind is fun. Unlike other survival crafters this game actually forces you to make a base and rewards you for actually decorating it. It also has pretty fun combat.)\n\nSkyrim (only around 20 hours right now, but I\u2019ve been playing it recently. I would recommend learning how to install mods though because things like sky ui and jumping while sprinting will make your experience more enjoyable)\n\nProject zomboid (only around 30 hours, but I only got it recently. Very fun alone, but better with friends. Perma death zombie survival game built to be unfair since an actual zombie apocalypse would be. You will die and it\u2019s all part of the game. After you do, you can start a new world with a new character, or a new character on the same world so you can maybe try and find your base to keep going. But, since it is a new character your skills will be reset.)\n\nGrounded (around 150 hours. survival crafter with a very fun combat system. Parrying an enemy\u2019s entire combo always feels so good!)\nUltrakill (60 hours. Very fun game and even lore fun if you really spend the time to learn it after beating it. Tons of secrets too)\n\nAnd the two games that have beat kept me coming back:\n\nThe binding of isaac (520 hours. Rogue like with tons of unlocks, every run really manages to feel fresh which I think is something most rogue likes don\u2019t really get right. This one just hits different.)\n\nTerraria (2000 hours including modded. My favorite game of all time. Base game is fun, and the modding scene is amazing! Calamity is the most popular mod and is basically dlc. The game is hard though and modded ramps that a lot later on but over coming those difficult bosses always feels so good.)\n\nHopefully some of these help.",

            "+1 came here to suggest this. I dare not admit this on reddit but I have friends (I'm sorry, I know, the bragging is terrible) nearly all of us have (or suspect we have) neurodiversity. The people who have stayed the longest lean towards ADHD or AuDHD.\n\nIn coming info dump (special interest level) TL:DR for attention span at the bottom\n\n---\n\nHere is why it works for us:\n\n- no one tells you what to do, you are told how things work and asked to help Odin kill the forsaken (a big boss in each biome) but how you do that is up to you. There are many different ways / techniques etc to play. \n- there is a lot to do and all of it works towards progress in some way so distraction / task hoping is never really a waste of time. You will need materials throughout the game and everything you do will contribute to that in some way.\n- it's hard. You have to pay attention to stay alive - the consequences of dying are annoying enough that this gives the adrenaline needed for them sweet focus dopamines, it's a stimulating relaxation. However dying isn't permanent, just annoying, so it's forgiving enough for when focus is being a bitch.\n- you will forget to eat in game, this will get you killed occasionally. You will eventually realise you have forgotten to eat in real life too. It's like a gamified life reminder. \u270c\ufe0f\n- it is great for parallel play, everyone can go off and do their own thing as well as coming together to help each other.\n- it's easy to find people to play with on the valheim discord or lfg reddit group but it's also a great solo game\n- it's a good mix of high energy and cozy, coming back to your base is a relief but there are occasional raids to keep you on your toes too! \n- if you do get stuck or things are too hard there are a lot of videos on YouTube or people on reddit with the answers so you don't need to worry about getting stuck for long and there's a big incentive to hyperfocus and deep dive if it catches you that way (there's a lot do learn and understand, different approaches etc) but equally everything can be worked out yourself / out of the box thinking also often works as a solution. \n- each time you start a new world it is different (randomly generated) so even when you know the game well you still get the novelty factor but with the comfort of the familiar. \n- your character can go into any world so if you get bored with one world or want to hop out and join someone you can do so at any time without losing your skills or inventory. \n- there's a big modding community constantly adding new and interesting things to change the base game up so I find myself starting new worlds for a new flavour every so often! \n- some mods are serious quality of life improvements for ADHD and can help take away the pain points of the game (for us it was inventory management. We use a mod called smarter chests which allows you to ctrl click everything from your inventory into a chest and then automatically sorts it into near by chests for you as long as that item is in that chest and that chest isn't full. So you can set up boxes for each type of item once and then just dump and run / not have to spent ages wading through materials wondering where the fuck you left your keys...)\n\n---\n\nTL:DR - truly is a sandbox, gameplay is diverse, all distractions ultimately add to progress, has the right mix of stimulation / keeping you on edge and relaxation to feel satisfying for a long time. Mods add another level of novelty too.",

The citadel has amazing atmosphere and gameplay fitting it along with a pretty scarse story leaving it to your imagination, F.E.A.R is simillar to the citadel but with a more coherent story, trepang2 is basically a spiritual succesor to F.E.A.R, S.W.A.T 4 has amazing atmosphere, fallen aces is a mix of im sim and boomer shooter and it works great tho i think the emotional factor might not be for you, mirrors edge again atmosphere and some parts can get pretty emotional, mgsV is just masterclass. Everything from cinematography, lighting, gameplay, sound design is perfect for immersion. I would recommend to play all games tho personally mgsV can hold up on its own as someone who begun with it. Prey has amazing atmosphere and is overall very immersive, dying light has gameplay, atmosphere, emotional moments so it should be to your liking.\n\nThese explanations might not make sense but im not sure how to explain it.

Grab a half decent pair of headphones. Turn it up so the engine/propeller/etc noises are realistically loud. \n\nOn a 20+ minute flight where you have all the assistance turned off and are actually controlling all of the systems in the plane, as well as flying using the in-plane systems like radio navigation using VOR or ILS beacons, you really feel like you're flying the actual plane. It's the most I've felt like I was *doing the actual thing* rather than just playing a game.\n\nPro-tip, for added realism, make sure you start your flight off at a gate or parking rather than on the runway, so you start off with the aircraft fully powered down, and go through the real process of powering it up step by step - it makes the whole experience feel just that much more real. Don't worry there's tutorials for starting up every plane on YouTube, as well as for how to navigate without the assistance turned on etc. \n\nBonus pro-tip, you can install OpenTrack to have free head tracking using your webcam, or paired with the app on your phone SmoothTrack. Playing with head-tracking on is what really sealed the deal and made me feel like I was in an actual airplane. \n\nSome people take it a step further and gradually build up a whole sim cockpit to make it even more immersive, but honestly even just with a stick and throttle I find I can forget I'm playing a game and feel like I'm really there.",

            "This is, in my opinion, the most immersive game out there.  \n\nWhere games like Red Dead are immersive in terms of dialog and hyper-realistic setting/ movement/ interaction, Outer Wild is immersive in that it explains *everything*.  \n\nEvery game mechanic, why the game takes place when it does, why you, why this star system, who are you and how did you get here.  The game revolves around a mysterious sci-fi concept that is explained so wonderfully.  Beyond that the only progression system in the game is player knowledge.  \n\nSo while the characters could have been voiced instead of text on screen, or the graphics could be improved, the very core sense of immersion is the best there is since no part of the game makes you have to say \"this makes sense because it's a game.\"  No running around the world searching for collectibles.  No leveling up your character.  No dropping lute or randomly killing something just because it moved.  Every moment of playing answers the question \"what would it be like to be in a real world with this set of circumstances?\"",
            "THIS",
            "I'm maybe halfway through it and this was gonna be my answer",

            "It is not only atmospheric but very underrated from an emotional angle. >!They kill the empress in front of you, you being her bodyguard and also her lover, they kidnap her daughter who also looks like your daughter, they blame you for the empress's death and they condemn you to death. Also in a text it is criticized that even if you are the best swordsman on the island, a sword could not save the empress from poison, but it is a sword that kills her, although with the support of occult powers, for which we have no answer at that moment.!<",

            "currently playing Mafia definitive edition, infact just started yesterday only.. its not that fast paced but yeah thats the beauty of it",
            "I used to be the same. You just have to find a game that clicks and have the right mindset. A good sign that you are immersed is doing something you have no reason doing. Like blocking of a door for no reason because you have a feeling to do so. It feels natural to do, something you would do in that situation. Atleast that is my understanding\n\nId recommend prey 2017. I perosonally found it to be among the most immersive games.\n\nAlso dont skip redables and such in games. They can change a scene dramatically and help you realize what is going on around you and dont stop yourself. If you feel like doing something do it. Sounds simple but it was a reason why i could not immersed myself before.",
            "This 100% articulated how I feel about it as well. I've discussed with countless people about how incredible RDR2 is. The world feels alive. Every detail is impressive. It is absolutely groundbreaking. But I cannot personally get past the western theme and the game feeling for me like it was a chore. I wish i could and im envious of others experiencing one of the most realistic and immersive games to be made. Ahead of its time without a question.\n\nI've attempted a playhlthrough 3 separate times and I can't get past the 10 hour mark.",

            "But that's how I feel about myself.",

            "Hinestly, aftet that incident at strawberry, i was really turned off. I dunno why but that really broke the game and immersion for me.  \n\nI played a bit more but the magic was gone",
            "man, when I first played it I played 6 hours straight (normally I'm exhausted after 3-4 hours, no matter how much I like the game). My second session was 2 hours and on my third session the magic was gone... I'm not a big fan of rockstar writing, and I don't like any of the GTA games. But I appreciate what they manage to pull of just as I appreciate RDR2. It's a brilliant game, but not for me unfortunately",
            "Maybe I am too low effort or something",
            "even if this is true, their comment should have been an upvote and adds nothing to the thread whatsoever",
            "So the game really prides itself on realism(it's still a video game tho) and accuracy for the time period which I think is awesome, the graphics are shockingly great for it's release and still hold up well today, the story is awesome, the side quests can slog sometimes but there are some legit hidden gems to it. The atmosphere of the game really feels like the middle ages and I'm a huge fan of the era.\n\nNow to the actual game mechanics. The combat is hard an unforgiving but once you master it, you truly master it and it's not just you that has to get good, Henry does too(Henry is the character you play as). When you first start you are not the chosen one, you're a bitch ass peasant and the world will remind you you're a bitch ass peasant every chance it gets. But in time you both become skilled, you'll go from literally swinging your weapon of choice with the precision and strength of a toddler to a man with keen thrust and strong arm, you'll go from shooting a bow like a blind man with Parkinson to an English long bow men. It's not like sky rim where your shots are straight and your sword arm still swings well but you do low damage, you can literally see the sluggishness and poor coordination as you use weapons you have no skill with and you do low damage because you lack physical strength and all of that is earned in the pit with captain Bernard, or you can be a masochist and try to level up by fighting bandits and random encounters (do not recommend, may cause brain tumors). And there's just so much more to it like swords hardly hurt heavy armor but annihilate someone in light, maces crush heavy armor like a tin can and stabbing weak points in armor is a kill etc... \n\nAsk if you wanna know more lol.\n\nAlso I believe it's on sale for like 3.99 on steam right now.",

            "It was a tad excessive and hollywoody, there are a few parts in the game where I was like naaah cmon, but still, that game made me feel lost for a couple of weeks after finishing it, there was a hole in my life there for a while",
            "They do that a few trope a few times to get you to move around the map more but it always picks up soon after.",
            "True though. I guess people don't care if you laughed or not and honestly, I get that. commenting \"Lol\" and contributing nothing meaningful or insightful annoys a lot of people. personally I just scroll past it and ignore it but taking the time and effort to actively downvote a comment like that is way too much effort to me. Who cares of you typed lol, it's not a big deal and putting in actual effort to downvote it is sad.",

            "All this talk about effort is hilarious considering you took the time to type this paragraph meanwhile downvoting takes less than half a second lol",
            "Honestly after my first playthrough I couldn't think of a single game that I could compare it to that would give me the same feeling, I'm sure I probably sound like a fan boy(cause I am) but it's a pretty unique experience. I guess if the devs who made oblivion tried to make the most realistic middle age themed game they possibly could? But that doesn't feel right lol you'll just have to give it a shot and if you don't like it who cares it's cheap as hell.",
