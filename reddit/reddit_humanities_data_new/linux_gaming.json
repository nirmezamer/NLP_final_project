While popular perception is that Windows \"just works\" and Linux distros need more tweaking, this is not necessarily true, in fact generally you're more likely to have to uninstall bloatware and install drivers on Windows, while a Linux distro is more likely to be configured to just work.

            "installing Bazzite this weekend on my desktop. pretty confident, but I'm curious if people have a checklist or something that they like to run thru to make sure that a fresh install is working properly and try to catch any issues early on instead of in the middle of actually using it.\n\ncompletely unrelated to gaming, but any RDP client suggestions? that's the piece of the puzzle that I'm the least sure about. I'd be okay with keeping a Windows partition for just that purpose if needed since it only comes up a handful of times per year at my current job.\n\n**EDIT:** still haven't attempted RDP yet, but gaming on Bazzite has been nearly flawless right out of the box. super impressed so far. still need to tweak and tune KDE, but I think I'll shed the Windows dual boot as soon as those new nvidia drivers are official (assuming that fixes Discord screen sharing).",
            "Absolutely done with microsoft so I'm gonna dive straight into linux. I've prepared everything and I feel completely ready to switch, but I'm still not too sure how to. I've got two PCs with VERY different use cases so I'd assume I would need different distros but some people have recommended to use the same for both? \n\nMy desktop is where I usually game but I do some video rendering/audio editing on it every now and then because of it's beefy cpu/gpu (amd). I've been thinking of installing either Bazzite or Nobara as I've heard those are pretty good. \n\nWhile it has a really good 13th gen i7, I mostly use my laptop to read articles, watch videos and write notes, not that much really. I've seen that mint is usually recommended for cases like this, specially because I'm not a programmer.\n\nDo these seem like good distros to pick? Or should I just do something like mint on both? Maybe once I know more about linux I'll give arch a try too, but I don't think it'd be the best idea right now.",

I have a 3050, and I'm curious whether people have figured out the drivers for the card already if Nvidia hasn't cooperated yet.",

Now, it is extremely laggy - 30s FPS at best, teens when there is action, and what feels like huge input lag. Any idea what this might be, or how to diagnose or fix it?\n\nI thought it might be cached shaders, so i tried \"clear download cache\" in Steam, but that didn't help. I'm not sure this actually clears cached shaders though. I haven't seen fossilize_replay running at any point.\n\nI'm on a Thinkpad with discrete graphics, and i've configured it to always use them, never the integrated graphics. glxinfo tells me \"OpenGL renderer string: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti with Max-Q Design/PCIe/SSE2\".

            "I used to daily drive Linux between about 2006 - 2014, usually Kubuntu, after which I mostly switched to W7 tho I kept using some Linux and BSD distros in a VM. Not for a while tho, since I've not had a PC of my own for the last few years. Occasionally using Termux on Android.\n\nMy favourite DEs were KDE3/Trinity and LXDE, usually with OpenBox tacked on. I don't like using cli if I can avoid it, tho it's fine when I need something specific. I like the layout style of Win9x with important stuff in the corners and in the bottom. The less transparency and tacky effects, the better. I just want to use stuff without much tinkering or distractions, but still want to set up stuff my way.\n\nI've not kept in touch. I don't quite understand what docker is or what installation method is preferred these days. I keep hearing about flatpaks and how the opinion on them varies.\n\nI used to use Wine extensively, incl. maintaining some apps. But I see that the Wine site hasn't changed in 20 years, not quite sure what state development is at... I hear Proton is all the rage these days? I'm not too obsessed with PC gaming, but I'd like to revisit some of my oldies, up to 2010-ish. In particular I wouldn't mind using a steering wheel (haven't picked up one yet) for racing.\n\nAlso, I don't and won't use Steam or anything with DRM. Will use my discs or stuff from Gog.\n\nSo where do I begin again? I hear Fedora is the most popular, but it seems a tad different from Ubuntu (tho I'm sure that has changed a lot in the last decade). And what about the other developments I've missed?\n\nEd: Also, what's the preferred boot manager these days, still GRUB? Is there any major difference between distros when it comes to hardware compatibility? And just wondering, how's FreeBSD/OpenBSD, is anyone using those as a user system?\n\nThanks.",

The official Linux version of Discord doesn't stream audio and there doesn't seem to be any public statements on when (if ever) it will be added, while community clients like Vesktop have workarounds for getting it mostly working. It can still be a little finnicky but it's worth a try if screen sharing really matters to you!",
            "I am assuming that based on you mentioning Nobara and Bazzite you are interested in gaming? Honestly, you can do pretty much anything on just about any distro. I would ask you two major questions; Are you pretty tech-savy? Are you wanting stability or the newest of the newest packages?\n\nIf you are pretty tech-savy and want stability I would recommend **Debian.** It is tried and true and been going strong for 30ish years. Debian gives great stability but if you have a super new GPU (like I do) you might run into issue. Debian offers you free reign to install and tinker to your heart's desire. \n\nIf you want stability but just want something that is \"windows-like\" and just works out of the box without tinkering a whole lot, I would go with **Linux Mint** as you mentioned. \n\nIf you want or need newer packages, you can go with **Nobara**. Its a good distro and GE does a great job. The issue that I have with Nobara is that its based on Fedora and uses DNF. \n\nIf you want newer packages but don't want to go crazy trying to learn Arch, you can always use something like **EndeavourOS.** It will allow you to use arch without having to get too worried about Arch. \n\n  \nI switched about 2 years ago and the one thing that I can teach you is that 90% of distros is all personal preference. You are going to be able to do 99.9% of the same stuff on Nobara/Bazzite that you would on Debian, Arch, Linux Mint, Ubuntu, etc. Tinker around and find something that you like. \n\nPS. One thing to remember as well, if you like a distro but not the main Desktop Environment that it comes with you can always download a different one. This isn't Windows. Welcome to the Penguin.",
            "I can't stress this enough: as a brand-new user, pick Ubuntu or an Ubuntu-based distribution. Pretty much all Linux software is available for/supported on Ubuntu. Support on Fedora-based distros is much worse. Stay AWAY from Arch, Manjaro, Gentoo, etc.\n\nThere are a few main desktop environments: GNOME, Cinnamon, KDE Plasma. There are definitely others, but these are the main 3. Look up each one and decide which DE you want to use. Cinnamon is great for being good out of the box at a Windows-like experience. KDE and GNOME are probably more customizable. KDE is pretty Windows-like. GNOME is taking things in a different direction, but has a lot of extensions to completely change the interface. I use GNOME but with several extensions to give a Windows-like experience, which I would not recommend for a beginner.\n\nAfter picking a DE, select a POPULAR distro that uses one of those by default. I.e. Ubuntu or PopOS for GNOME, Linux Mint for Cinnamon, Kubuntu for KDE. There are a million choices out there, but you won't go wrong with a popular Ubuntu-based distro.\n\nI would strongly recommend picking the same distro for both machines. No need to mix it up. Laptop driver support is way better than it used to be, but some hardware is not supported well. Do some research to make sure your laptop is well-supported under Linux, or just try it out with a dual-boot setup first.\n\nGood luck!",
            "Proceed with caution with Nobara - as u/crosseyedCOBRA says, its based on Fedora and that's not nearly as popular as debian/ubuntu based distros, which means support is less.\n\nIt's also maintained by a very small team, there will be no support, you'll be on your own entirely - although you can use discord to ask for help.\n\nThe distro you pick is such a personal choice, I've tried so many of them, it's crazy.\n\nI used Pop\\_Os! for a while, but found it too opinionated and customised, so I settled on Mint.\n\nYou really can't go wrong with Mint and the Cinnamon desktop - it's crazy easy to use, if all you want to do is get gaming with Linux.\n\nThere's TONS of support for it, because it's so popular.\n\nGaming with Steam is as simple as installing drivers, via the Mint driver manager, installing Steam and optionally, setting compatibility for each game - something which Steam is starting to do automatically now.\n\nWhatever you do, go for the most popular distro if this is your first time.\n\nAvoid Debian unless you want a LOT of extra work getting the latest packages.\n\nYes, it is possible to get up and running with the grandaddy of Ubuntu, but there's extra steps. \n\nTry Mint first - I can see you are already leaning that way, give it a shot.\n\nThe only thing you'll lose is some time and you may have fun doing it anyway.\n\nIt'll take you I reckon 90 minutes tops to have your first game up and running, from downloading the ISO, to installing it, to getting the drivers setup and steam installed.",
            "1- Many, or most, Windows Steam games work right away with Steam Play/Proton activated; some required a different Proton version; some require more tinkering than that. You can check on https://www.protondb.com and https://areweanticheatyet.com and see what experiences people have had with the games important to you. As for me, I just expect stuff to work at this point and don\u2019t bother investigating in advance \u2013 but it\u2019s probably worth checking when it comes to AAA games with fussy extra launchers and anticheat complications.\n\n2- I haven\u2019t used Nvidia in a while, but it shouldn\u2019t be hard to install the drivers through whatever your distro\u2019s driver/software manager thingie is called. It\u2019s *less* convenient than with AMD and is or at least used to be less functional with Wayland than with Xorg (the \u201ctraditional\u201d display server; Wayland is a newer display protocol that enables features like running multiple monitors with different DPI scales or different refresh rates\u2026 though it has some drawbacks as well until all is ironed out; ymmv).",

            "Me too",
            "1. yeah, probly don't do Arch as a first distro unless you're willing to reinstall\\* and treat Linux as a hobby to be learned as you go.\n2. with Debian honestly don't bother. even if you install a custom kernel and manually install Nvidia drivers there's still other stuff in the system that is just getting more and more dated by the day. Debian is on a two year release cycle. people will bring up Debian Testing and Sid.. but like.. why bother. For Fedora there is Nobara, which is more or less a preconfigured Fedora gaming distro. it's debatable whether or not Fedora & Nobara are good beginner distros. (if you try Nobara update with the update app, not the terminal or software store.\n3. people will argue, but yes. you want to be on 555 (or newer) with wayland on nvidia.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* keep in mind that reinstalling Linux isn't a big deal. you can install your /home directory on a separate partition and reinstall the system to the system partition and keep your stuff. the pain in the ass is reinstalling your apps and signing into everything.\n\nthere's also a program called Timeshift that does more or less what the name implies. my current solution is dual booting debian and cachyOS. i have a full Rsync backup of my cachy install on a separate drive, so that if cachy dies and i don't feel like fixing it i can just boot into debian and apply the backup. ez.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nall that said, my advice is to just install Ubuntu or an Ubuntu based distro until you've wrapped your head around how linux works in general. it's not the most performant but it's reliable, highly compatible and there's lots of support.\n\nanother thing to keep in mind is a lot of articles out there are outdated or just outright bad advice. beware the third party repo, ppas and .debs. flatpak is your friend.",
            "1. CachyOS is *nice*, but it wouldn't be my first recommendation. If you want to go with an Arch distro, I would suggest Garuda. The forums are responsive, and up front it takes you through an installer that offers so many different tools that you might be looking for.\n\n2. It can be incredibly tedious to do, depending on where you start. If it's base Fedora or Debian, it may be a bit uphill. Consider something like [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg), it is Fedora with all of the tweaks that Valve made for SteamOS.\n\n3. Probably, leaning towards yes.",
            "Wine is still very much supported they just don't like updating their site apparently. \n\nAs for things like gog you would be using lutris, bottles or heroic games launcher since they're really nice GUI front ends. \n\nLogitech steering wheels work out of the box with no issues. \n\nDistro seemingly doesn't matter much these days since flatpaks are a thing so you can get the latest software that way so I would use what your comfortable with so if that's Ubuntu then go for it. I myself enjoy Opensuse & that's been my main distro for awhile but I wouldn't suggest it to a new or returning Linux user. \n\nGrub is mostly the default still & BSD is good & getting better but still not as good as Linux in terms of compatibility. Look into ghostBSD as it's a great beginner BSD.",
            "Things have moved on MASSIVELY since 2014 - you'll be so pleasantly surprised.\n\nJust download a popular Ubuntu based distro, get yourself setup with Steam and some games and take it from there.\n\nValve have nailed things in terms of simplicity - as have the maintainers of popular distro's. \n\nIt's way easier than it used to be - I'm totally an OG on this, my first Linux experience was RedHat 4.2 in 1996.\n\nNow I can't be bothered hitting my head against desks and brickwalls - the easier the better - the problem for most people who don't want to be compiling kernels for obscure hardware these days, is which distro to pick - there's frikkin' thousands of them.\n\n90% of them are just a riff on Debian or the more popular Ubuntu :D",

There's also XFCE, but it's a bit heavier (it uses a few hundred megabytes of RAM more).\n\nNote: If you are or will become proficient with the Linux terminal, you can also try a window manager (e.g., i3). A window manager is not a desktop environment but a component that opens and arranges windows. That would be the lightest option.",
            "Endeavour sounds like a good choice to me. \n\nYou could also take a look at Garuda Linux, an Arch-based \u201cgaming\u201d distro (also with a KDE flavour). Never used it myself, though.",
            "Hey, thank you for such a detailed response.\n\n1. I'm cool with learning how to keep proper backups, but yeah, it's probably smarter to get into the general flow of using Linux itself before I commit to something bleeding-edge like Arch.\n2. Gotcha. I knew Debian ran with dated packages, but didn't know it was that bad. I've been told that if you're gonna use Sid, you might as well just learn Arch or another rolling-release distro. Thank you for the tip about Nobara.\n3. I figured. I've been looking at feedback of 555 and it seems like there's still some kinks to be worked out, so I'll likely wait for the stable release. From what I've seen, it's not really worth the headaches that come with using the previous drivers.\n\nI've got a couple drives in my PC - putting a backup partition on my secondary and keeping a live distro on a USB stick/external drive should function just the same, right? I'm assuming the important part is just being able to access and install the backup from a working environment.\n\nI've considered various flavors of Ubuntu, but I've heard terrible things about Snap - especially the Snap version of Steam, and some problems it can have compared to the non-Snap version.  I've also heard anecdotes about Ubuntu potentially replacing non-Snap programs with the Snap versions. Don't know if that's true - as you said, a lot of information isn't so reliable.\n\nMint seems to have all the benefits of Ubuntu without as many downsides, so I'll probably give it or Nobara a try, unless I feel like setting up a proper physical backup and learning CachyOS the hard way.\n\nAgain, thanks for the thorough response, I really appreciate it.",

Never really had any problems with it as long as I took care picking the right hardware.\n\nI was mostly annoyed with how some distros and DEs kept changing things, like KDE3 to 4 was a disaster and got me scrambling for the next few years.\n\nI also really enjoyed FreeBSD, even in a VM it was stupidly fast, I just never had the courage to install it on a physical disc due to the weird (to me) file system and various limitations.\n\nAny idea if Logitech wheels are good within Wine too? Like if a game only uses Dinput or Xinput or supports the wheel model directly, will that work with Force Feedback and stuff? I found some guides/opinions, but mostly regarding native games.",
            "Yea I was looking at some stuff yesterday and I'll probably just stick with Ubuntu, I still have muscle memory for apt-get and such...\n\nYou know what confuses me... As I said, I was using Linux for quite a while and never really had any major problems, maybe with the exception of one very particular sound card. It was honestly uncanny how everything just worked, it was almost disappointing.\n\nMy first experience was when I had a flu in 2006, so I had a week to kill. So I figured I'll check out this Linux thing, maybe I'll never get anywhere and just spend a week bashing my head, whatever, I might learn something. So I borrowed a random laptop from work, burned an Ubuntu Live CD and ran it on that laptop... And everything just worked?! But like, everything. Display, sound, network, printer, Bluetooth phone features over USB... Everything. Just needed 3 clicks to install proprietary drivers for something and maybe Flash or whatever that was at the time. This was still the XP-Vista era when one needed discs with drivers or a web dive for everything  Anyway I installed the thing, set up everything I needed and was done in a day or two. No weird geekery. Eventually I learned to do more oddball things, but I never had any significant problems finding solutions for everything I needed, even when I fucked something up. A simple web search would always get me the answers I needed, with steps how to do even the more complex system stuff.\n\nNo more difficult then using cmd and regedit on Windows, and more convenient with the centralised package manager and so many options.\n\nAnd yet, whenever even the fairly experienced techies try Linux *these days*, they almost always bitch how they can't find this or that or they need to paste a command into cli or how things are named differently or whatever... Like Linus Tech Tips for example, not that I think too highly of them but I wouldn't say they're complete morons.\n\nAnd I tend to see this everywhere, first semblance of something different and they bitch and give up; yet they accept all the bullshit and changes Microsoft/Apple/Google throw at them.\n\nAnyway, so since I've not had a PC of my own for a while and am kinda out of the loop, these stories made me wonder if things have gotten worse... But I guess people are rather just dumb.\n\nAnyway anyway. My plan is to buy a small factor PC and a used laptop, and obviously I'll make sure beforehand that everything I get is Linux compatible.",

            "Sadly I never heard about them, but I'll go and look up them.  \nMy original idea was Debian, and [people said it should be fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/debian/s/krE3H0kWjH), which should be with Steam and maybe Proton, but I'm quite unsure about the programs from the _high seas_. I used Ubuntu for a brief period of time with Steam with great success, but I don't have experience with the _unconventional methods_. Do you think it would be as seamless as on Windows?

KDE Plasma is best for gaming but Gnome is a close second. you want one of those two. know that the compositor needs to be manually disabled in Plasma x11 for games and sometimes video to avoid stutter. Gnome disables it automatically.\n\n  \nusing Linux for general use / gaming isn't really outright hard, it's just the sheer amount of crap you need to be aware of to have a good experience that seems like a lot at the start.",
            "Base Ubuntu is okay if you remove snap from it and use the official steam installer which is what I personally run (I've been running ubuntu for like 15 years so didn't feel like hopping distros when those changes came around) - granted that requires a little manual tinkering (and probably some upkeep whenever the next distro update comes around to remove it again) so it's not so much easier than just using stuff like nobara anyhow. (Though if you like KDE Kubuntu is still on the older KDE 5 version until the next release in october .)\n\nMain downside with Ubuntu derivatives like Pop!, tuxedo or Mint for gaming is that they are based on the long term release of Ubuntu only so the base system tend to get a bit outdated, especially right now since they are on a release from 2 years ago and 2-3 months before updating to the one from this year. They do get some updated, more so Pop! than mint but it can be worth to manually update kernel/drivers depending on system if you use them. (This might change for Pop! Os once the next version is released later this year.)",

If they need it as an HTPC, they can set it up so that once in their DE of choice, Steam will automatically launch into Big Picture Mode. Outside of that, there's no real way to get the Steam Deck experience with an NVIDIA GPU anywhere to my knowledge.\n\nI'm sorry you're not having the best experience with Bazzite, a fair amount of distros (Bazzite included) come with certain tweaks that the devs like/believe should be in the DE by default that can sometimes break the experience for some users.",
            "Simply the way it is. Repos, constantly updated (rolling release) and the fact I'm using it for so long that it's natural for me. \n\nAnd it turns out it's quite good for gaming, when even Valve based their Steam Deck on Arch(SteamOS is Arch based) + KDE :)",

            "as i already said in other replies: i'd happily PAY for a distro that actually gives a shit about supporting anything but the bare minimum.\n\nthis is the problem with you people: you expect everyone to be a cheapskate like you. as a software developer myself, i know that our time has value, so i'm prepared to pay for someone doing the work,\n\ni know it's not trivial and i actually know what's involved in getting this to work, but i will certainly not waste my time working on this myself, unless i get paid for it.\n\nbut gain, i'm willing to pay for a distro that finally frees me from people like you who just endlessly go on about how \"linux is not there to support you\". fine, then i'm not here to use it,\n\nAnd i'm certainly not here to try and understand what drove you to have these absurd ideas about how software development, user friendliness and support should work, according to you. I'd rather pay more pragmatic people to deliver something more sensible.",
            "That\u2019s not entirely true. A lot of things like distros and programs are made by entire organizations that DO generate money to keep existing and SUPPORTING THEIR USERS. - Ubuntu, for instance, isn\u2019t just some little program by some person just because they want it to exist. It\u2019s a widely used piece of software and the developers are in a position of responsibility for it. If not, leave Canonical I suppose. - But in any case, HDR is one of many widely used standards, even by the average consumer (and not as niche as some people here try to make it out to be) and should simply be built into operating-systems by now. - I too can\u2019t believe it hasn\u2019t been figured out and standardized by now. It has been years.",
            "I don\u2019t wanna seem rude and to be fair, I don\u2019t know what problem you had/have. I too have been daily driving arch since January (of course switching to windows a few times too) and have so far had no actual issues.\n\nActually, Arch was my first ever distro, so as a complete rookie, I can say it\u2019s pretty good. Any problems I had were easily solved with the wiki and most of them were my own screw ups. Of course, this probably won\u2019t apply to the majority but yeah",
            "in arch, you build your perfect system yourself, you literally start in an empty shell forced to choose each package you install.  \nits your fault it broke.",
            "Brother, all you have to do is wait, as many people have said, HDR is new to Linux. Give it a bit and it'll get added just like every other popular feature does. If you can't wait, you're already dual booting, so use windows in the meantime",
            "Yeah....Except no, no it's not.\n\nIt's all a matter of perspective and use case - And his use case is something 99.9% of users don't care for.\n\nThe only reason he mentions his PC is for bragging rights. Which, once again, no one care's for.",
            "True, but you're also a sample size of 1 and TVs tend to get faster feature support because they're easier to make. I'm not sure if that was the case with HDR but it's still easy to find HDR-less monitors at the midrange today (or really bad HDR support). I got an HDR monitor only about a month ago.\n\nThe other main reason would be that it's only recently become possible with the rapid progress of Wayland. Now all the foundations are in place I don't expect it to take much longer to get HDR out of the experimental state on Linux but time will tell I guess.\nI'm glad it's finally being pushed, it did always seem like a  sore spot.",

            "True but not sure it's that far off as these were new at that price.",
            "Correct as they're not rated afaik. Still cool you can at least get support for that price range along with 165Hz on an IPS panel",
            "Tbf we will be waiting a few more YEARS at least to get stable HDR support. Look at VRR, it only bearly works now.",
            "Sounds more like you are just jealous or can\u2018t even think about any use case other than the mentioned \u201eoffice\u201c type work, which by the way is 99% non-linux for everyone out there in the real world doing real work. You and your low expectations are part of the problem.\n\nThe point is none of these -should- be edge cases if you want any kind of serious adoption. They all need to be considered basic use cases, just like on a commercial OS.",
            "The topic is about high end gaming, an edge use case. So what's your point in pointing out that it's about an edge use case?",
            "they might be rated vesa hdr400 but all you're really getting is 10 bit color and not high dynamic range.\n\ngood enough to not having to see colorbanding but not good enough to have the colors really pop and have lots of detail in very dark or very bright sections",
            "VRR works fine? It just doesnt work well with x11 and nvidia because x11 is old and nvidia doesnt properly support wayland...\n\nLiterally, been using it for years now. Like at least 4-5 without issue with my AMD cards. All the problems I see with VRR are x11 and/or nvidia users and in both cases, that makes sense...",
            "Which is understandable. Maybe if we had more people asking \"how do I help contribute to HDR on Linux\" instead of \"when HDR\" it would get finished faster",
            "Using 2 HDR monitors is not what I think as a basic use case. As other commenters said, even Windows has problems with this.\n\nAnd please, tell me why software development and almost anything that has to do with servers isn't \"real work\".",
            "First of all, it's not \"99% non-linux\", [take a look](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems).\n\nSecondly, I do love how you all are boasting about \"doing real work,\" while we both know it's still about gaming. I'm a software engineer (enterprise web, backend). Linux is the best possible workstation for me, as the entire environment is native and production-like. Is my work not real to you?",
            "The edge use case is HDR gaming with two monitors, not gaming in general. Having an HDR monitor for gaming is something relatively new (2021 I think was the start of windows supporting it as a feature), both OS have problems with the technology as seen in other comments and I think we can agree most people do not drive dual HDR setups on PC.\n\nAnd if you have doubts on the gaming in general, even OP said that they can run most games well and even VR.",
            "I don't think the layman, or even the average linux user, could contribute anything meaningful to HDR implementation on Linux. Have you contributed anything?",
            "This is linux gaming, not servers, and yes 2 hdr monitors is a perfectly reasonable basic use case in 2024. It works well enough in windows, i know because i have 3.\n\nThis is the problem with you guys, i\u2018d happily pay say 200$ for a distro that aknowledges that not everyone has the same low expectations as you people who think a monitor should cost 50$ and only then it\u2018s worth supporting. I\u2018d even accept binary blob drivers as long as you provide hardware support on par with windows. \n\nMaybe microsoft will get the idea one day and just put their HAL and APIs on top and call it a day. Apparently nobody in this space gets that this would be in demand, so it will take a commercial vendor.",
            "For desktop usage (\u201eoffice\u201c) you suggested, yes it\u2018s 99%, this is not servers or mobile.\n\nAlso, it should be common sense to understand that -you- are the edge case, not all the other users for whom linux is still not a viable alternative.\n\nI\u2018m a software engineer too, and my time is worth much more than putting up with sub-par hardware support of an OS that\u2018s 5 to 10 years behind what 100$ can buy me. \n\nI\u2018d happily pay 200$ a year for a distro that realizes this and works to bring support up to par with windows, but apparently nobody in this space even understands that this would fly.",
            "I haven't. But I also respectfully disagree with that statement, bug reports are contributions, obviously we'll have to wait for a pre release/beta build, but average users can help with detailed and consise bug reports",

Can you spare some of your precious time for that?\n\nHere, I'll post it for you:\n> For desktop computers and laptops, Microsoft Windows is the most used at 72.22%, followed by Apple's macOS at 14.73%, desktop Linux at 3.88%, and Google's ChromeOS at 2.45%. Since ChromeOS is a Linux based OS, it can be added to the total desktop Linux share bringing it to 6.33%. 0.01% is FreeBSD and the remaining 6.7% is likely obscure Linux distributions. \n\nAlso, as a professional, I fail to see how spending some time to make your workspace efficient is a waste. Are you telling me that you can buy any non-Linux machine and start to code out of the box? Do you code in Notepad++?",
            "Of course you fail to understand that tinkering with an OS is not productive use of time, i prefer to write software on an OS that works out of the box and with an IDE that is fully featured: Visual Studio, for which there is no free alternative either that comes even close.\n\nEndlessly tinkering with and babysitting your OS honestly gives off a lot more \u201escript-kiddy\u201c vibes than \u201eprofessional developer\u201c."
