            " It's rare to see someone wear a mask and ear protection for fixing a window lol. Good on you. My dad never wore anything and messed up his lungs from inhaling silica.\n\nAnyway, quality work!",
            "As a window cleaner of 17 years, I have seen all different styles of windows and repaired a few as well. This is genuine craftsmanship, I'm blown the fuck away. These windows suck, and he did amazing at repairing and replacing everything. I personally wouldn't touch this shit with a 10 foot pole.",
            "I mean it\u2019s great craftsmanship but wasn\u2019t rope used because it was quiet compared to the chain running against the wood? And the squeaking? Maybe it\u2019s to the charm of the place, idk",
            "Im curious why not just replace the window all together? Wouldn\u2019t it be more energy efficient and save u money in the long run?",
            "As a European I am shocked about the window quality. No hate - but I could never imagine having such a thin windows without double insulation and proper steadiness while moving etc. I wonder why there is such a big difference\u2026 \ud83e\udd78",
            "There is nothing, and I mean NOTHING, more satisfying than a smooth operating counterweight window.",
            "American windows are so confusing to me as somebody from the EU",
            "Somebody has been watching this old house",
            "my German brain can't understand why these kind of windows are still being used",
            "That\u2019s impressive. I would\u2019ve just moved",
            "The way the lower sash wobbled when he opened it shows that it is WAY too loose in it's track to be anything like weather tight. Even a mild breeze will be blowing right through that window.",
            "It still sound broken, it wobbles from side to side and lets 90% of the heat out, there was no other solution?",
            "I had to work on about, 20 of these windows in a 1920\u2019s house I just got done working on a few days ago. They do great if maintained, and look aesthetically pleasing to me. The pain in the ass ones are the ones people have painted over so many times and haven\u2019t been open for years. Have to chisel through 1/8\u201d of paint rofl.",
            "It\u2019s still very squeaky and rattly.. Also these types of windows look very poorly insulated. Seems better to just replace it with modern windows.",
            "I never have the sound on but in the UK, sash windows have ropes so that the mechanism is as quiet as possible. That one looked a bit rattly.",
            "Probably cheaper to replace the whole window",
            "Is this in a place with cold weather during the winter? That window looks like it is very poorly insulted/thin. Pretty much the same when open as when closed \ud83d\ude06",
            "I have lived in so many old houses with broken windows like this. They are so heavy you have to have to struggle it open with two arms and prop it open with something robust.\nI didn't know what was happening on the inside till now.",
            "Well hung!",
            "What a bad window design, is it american?",
            "without seen the before/after comparison this isnt quite as satisfying, especially since the window still doesnt run very well. add metal tracks and a bit of silicone grease for 10$, it would make a world of difference.\n\nthat is if you dont replace those ancient windows in the first place, but that would cost a little bit more of course.",
            "[removed]",
            "There are a lot of common misconceptions in the commenta, so I'll try to address them all here.\n\n**Weatherproofing** - the purpose of this mechanical restoration isn't to weatherproof, it is to facilitate the amooth operation of the window. The storm window that is installed behind this window is what does the weatherproofing.\n\n**Sound** - WD40 takes care of the sound. The homeowner agreed to apply WD40 because I can't stand the smell. Literally, the smell makes me dizzy and I have to sit down.\n\n**Why chain?** - Chain lasts much longer; it doesnt absorb dirt, get crusty or hard over time, it doesn't stretch, it doesn't jump the pulley and get stuck. I mechanically restored the windows in my home 20 years ago and they show no signs of needing maintenance any time soon.\n\n**Lateral movement** - I can score the spring bronze (metal strips) to decrease the lateral movement. However, any decrease in lateral freedom means an increase in friction. Thus, so long as I can open and close the window with one or two fingers, I'm inclined to let the sash have that lateral freedom.\n\n**Why not vinyl replacement windows?** - Replacement windows aren't ubiquitous because they're superior quality. They're ubiquitous because contractors love how little effort is involved in installing them. A typical vinyl replacement window comes with a 10 year mechanical 20 year glass warranty. When they break, most of the time they can't be fixed, and so they need to be replaced. They use springs instead of counterweights which, unlike counterweights, degrade over time. They use more friction than a rope-and-pulley window, and so are less than ideal for elderly or disabled individuals. Additionally, if a house already has storm windows, a mechanical restoration costs less not only in the long term, but in the immediate term as well. Finally, some people prefer the asthetics of the wood windows.\n\n\nI'll do my best to edit and add answers to any other questions asked as a reply to this post.",
            "I mean nice piece of antic engineering but... Man this have zero thermal insulation, comparing to european windows even from the last it have double glass to insulate.",
            "Looks a tiny bit over engineered.",
            "why the hell would you use chain instead of nylon rope? the end result is way noisier than it needs to be.",
            "Makes so much sense now that i think about it, but i did not realize some windows have counterweights.",
            "That man makes it look easy. Congrats!",
            "Sash windows in the UK can be real fun, particularly in conservation areas where they cannot be double glazed and can only be replaced like for like.\n\nThis guy could probably do well here.",
            "For reasons unknown, my backyard had over a dozen of those sash weights stacked up.  For some reason my parents didn't get rid of them and me and my friends pretended they were artillery or mortar shells.",
            "I have a big old Victorian house with sash windows and have done those repairs.  If I bought new ones with the weights the cost is $3500 each so I think I will do the work.  Of course everyone just replaces them with vinyl crap.  It is a labour of love.",
            "The repair and maintenance of guillotine windows are really expensive, but I can't deny that they look stylish.",
            "Did all that work and couldn\u2019t remove the l bracket from the window",
            "I've never seen a window with counter weights. That's pretty cool!",
            "Done dozens of these box sash windows, its not actually that difficult, except getting the new cord over the pulley and down into the box. How he managed to do it with a chain I cant guess, as theres usually very little room at the top of the pulley and the pulleys are usually painted solid.\nDeffo should have cut some side-strips though to take out that gap imo.",

            "Beautiful work. I\u2019ve restored several double hung windows and the effort is worth it. These have been in place for 75+ years and can go for another 100. Vinyl can\u2019t compare. You can get comparable R value to double glazed by adding external storms. You can\u2019t replicate the mortise and tenon sash construction and mullion profile without spending $1,000s.",
            "Very impressive tusm level precision diligent repair work",
            "Respect for those that do their craft well.",

            "I keep trying to tell the guys at work (I\u2019m a glazier) that when grinding glass you NEED TO WEAR A MASK!! Silica is awful to the lungs, on top of that I\u2019m the only one without tinnitus from hammer drilling tile all day \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

            "I've been a home handym'n for 10 years and I would not touch that window either. \"You need to call a real window guy who know who to repair old windows as I am not that guy.\"",
            "Oh damn, really?\n\nMy parents house still has its original windows and they are this style. Each and every one has the rope and pulley system minus the extension the original owner added on later.\n\nThey all still work too! A few of the windows have a little distortion from the sagging glass, but otherwise they\u2019re good. Had one of those window salesmen stop by once and when he started looking at our windows he was like \u201cNevermind\u201d and left. Guess now I know why lol.",
            "Why would you touch that shit with a 10 foot pole?",
            "House I grew up in had double hung windows with rope yep.",
            "Yeah seems a really odd choice. Super hard material against metal rollers. Going to be loud and wear out faster surely?",
            "WD40 takes care of the sound. The homeowner agreed to do that part because I can't stand the smell. Chain doesn't break or jump the pulley.",
            "Could be cheaper, though that's a good bit of labor.  Best guess is aesthetic consistency. A single vinyl replacement window might just look out of place. so cheaper to fix the original than pay to do all the windows even if it's what you should do. either that or they really like the wood. It's hard to get wood windows like that now.",
            "It's probably not more cost-effective to replace. It's likely an old house judging by the counterweight windows. To make significant energy savings, the whole \"house system\" would need to be updated to some energy efficiency standard. Doing that would cost in the five figures easily (windows are expensive). And it could take far longer to see those savings depending on how long they are planning on staying in the house.",
            "They're mostly inferior, but if they're well maintained and have storm windows on the outside, they're not bad. They're super repairable because they don't use any silly proprietary parts, and they're made of common materials. No thermopane seals to break, no garbage spring balances. Perhaps I'm looking at the past through rose colored glasses, but... I've replaced the balances on one of my vinyl windows twice in 5 years. Pain in the ass to get the correct parts too. Then I go to work and see 100+ year old counterweight windows that still work like new. Grinds my gears. \n\nWith all of that said, old single pane windows are not as efficient, not as secure, and not as safe. But they look cool, and will outlast most of us. Plus they're so damn satisfying to operate. Smooth as butter, and can be lifted with a finger like in the video.\n\nEdit: Forgot to say that lots of old homes and buildings also keep them for historical accuracy.",
            "If it\u2019s a listed building then you can\u2019t.",
            "There's a storm window behind the rope-amd-pulley window that does all the weatherproofing. The problem with replacement windows is that when they break, you have to replace them. They all use spring instead of counterweighta, which degrade over time. There's a bit of a range, but they typically come with 20 year warranties which, in my opinion, is ridiculously low for a window.",
            "I'm on a city planning commission so I have a different take. More than likely, if he were to replace the window he would have to redo the entire frame in order to bring the entire thing up to code. Code requirements are very lax when it comes to repairing existing parts of your home as is, but when you try to modify or update pretty much anything in a strict city that upgrade has to comply with all relevant codes. That means permitting and approvals and a whole bunch of hassle.\n\nThese single pane Windows are REALLY inefficient compared to modern double-pane windows, but if it's a temperate climate then I can see a homeowner not wanting to bother with the pain in the ass that is local government.\n\n  \nEdit: It could also be that this home is in a designated \"Historic District/Community\" so the chances of getting approval to update pretty much anything about a home is slim to none in that situation.",
            "New windows just dont last like old windows.  Mine are 90 years old, original, and in great shape.  Also, with an exterior or interior storm, they have a comparable R-value.  Of course they will never seal as tightly as new windows, but if its an old house, you're probably not super tight regardless of the windows.",
            "Replacing old windows like that with a new one would take 30+ years to pay for itself.",
            "Those windows are from decades and decades ago.  You really aren't going to find new houses being built with these types of windows.",
            "They look super old and loose. My parents replaced our old windows with sash windows when I was a kid. Smooth running but totally filled the frames, no wobbling or rattling around.",
            "Double pane/double glazed windows as we know them are an American invention. This is an old house likely predating the time that double glazed windows hit the market that has never been retrofitted with anything better. You can see though that it does have what looks to be a storm window added to the outside for extra protection/insulation.",
            "I couldn't imagine living without a screen.\u00a0",
            "In addition to storm windows, as is the case with this window, to insulate the house I often encounter window sashes that have had the single panes replaced with double insulated glass. I also encounter many sashes with double insulated glass that have counterweights from when they had single paned glass. These windows have a habit of gliding down on their own prior to my intervention.",
            "But is it smooth, though? Even after he was done, the window pan had a lot of free play.",
            "These types of windows are found in very old homes in the US and the UK. \n\nI doubt that any of these have been put into a new build for the past 50 years.",
            "This window style is common on 1900 - 1950s flats in Scotland. It\u2019s a pain to use, a pain to fix and the counterweight ropes are usually broken.",
            "Double hung windows! Basically if you took a tall window and cut it in half horizontally. The sashes (the \"halves\" of the window) are staggered one behind the other so they can move up and down independently. This allows you to line up the sashes in the middle, such that the top and bottom of the window are open. Because hot air rises, it encourages the warmer room air to exhaust out the top, which in turn pulls in cooler fresh air from the bottom. Great for days with little or no wind.\n\nForgot to mention they're also super easy to clean.",
            "Exactly my thought. Coming from a country, where my own home has 4 layers of glass and the window is basically air tight, this is really something \u201einteresting\u201c. On the other hand, this type of homes most likely won\u2019t have any mold anywhere.",
            "As an American, I thought this was a European window. There's no screen!",
            "It\u2019s all so flimsy and easy to break into. The wood looks very thin with moving parts in concealed places.",
            "They\u2019re actually great. You can open both of them on a hot day and it creates a convection current which cools down the room very effectively.",
            "Because replacing them is expensive.  People are cheap.",
            "Yeah, instead of using traditional Windows that use sustainable materials we should all use plastic double tilt ones. Very progressive, thanks Germany.",
            "The storm window behind it is what keeps the heat and cold from infiltrating. As for the sound, all it needs is some WD40.    I didn't apply the WD40 myself because I can't atand the smell; the homeowner said they would do it.",
            "You can actually get a pretty high r value out of old double hung windows if you line them properly and use storms. Can\u2019t see enough of the restoration in this video to know for sure but with the right restoration you can be close to modern materials in terms of performance",
            "That's what I thought when I only saw the thumbnail",
            "Continental Europeans when they see a window that isn't made of plastic b like:",

            "Smooth. Thanks for the write up.",
            "A chain will be longer wearing and more permanent. No one is ever going to want to salvage 100-year-old nylon rope, but people lovingly preserve hundred-year-old chains all the time.",
            "If by maintenance free, you mean unrepairable, then no. If by maintenance free, you mean replacing the ropes with chain, then yes.",
            "They're weights for the sash windows.",
            "The problem with WD40 is that it will off gas eventually. It can leave an oily residue, but a silicone grease with the right modifiers for temperature fluctuations can last forever in an application like this.",
            "The huge gap between the sash and the frame is also bothering me, the amount of lateral movement is crazy. Even with the atomic strip that's gonna be draughty as fuck",

            "Yep, Parents house is 100 years old. Old part of the house has these old double hung single pane windows. But they've been retrofitted with storm windows with screens. And the new addition they built onto the house 30 years ago is of course all double pane, because... that's been the standard since even decades before then.",

            "The office I work in has counterweight windows. Fully functional, some with the original glass panes. Built 1888. They are amazing, but I\u2019m on the California coast where we get very little severe weather. Not sure I\u2019d want these windows where it\u2019s cold, but omg they are so satisfying to pull up and down.",

            "And in older homes, you wanted the top pane opened upstairs so your cooler air from the cellar would get pulled through the whole house. Might only be a few degrees depending on the day, but I've heard people swear that it's better than actually air conditioning",

            "Cool!",
            "Thank you. I don't know all of the applications for these things and the specifics- but what I do know is people overestimate and overuse WD40 thinking it is the cure all for everything and it's not.",

We had initially asked the sellers to repair the windows, but they didn't want to fuss with removing the trim and repainting it all just to re-tension the cords. The windows still went up and stayed in position, so we let it pass. \n\nHow much did the repair cost in your clip? I'd estimate several hundred based on work hours, but I'd be interested to know if we were to try and tackle the windows in our own house.",
            "what do you charge per window? I was getting prices like 1500 per window for reglaze (3 over 1), paint sashes, paint the sill, and restore function.  Probably going to end up doing it myself.",

They made some questionable decisions in their renovation, one of which being the weird green-grey carpet in the upstairs bedrooms. I decided to pull up the carpet and lay down wood in the room I planned to use as my office, and when I pulled the carpet I found that 1) there was glorious original hardwood underneath (although weirdly its part red oak and part heart pine) and 2) the carpet install was so half-ass it only took me 2 hours to strip and dispose of the carpet - including driving it to the dump -  and another 2 hours with a belt sander to get it looking nice. I left a good bit of the \u2018distressed\u2019 character it had, mostly because I didn\u2019t want to get it perfect then ding it up myself. This was my first time refinishing hardwood. Huge thank you to the lazy crew that saved me a ton of work saving these floors, can\u2019t wait to do the rest of the bedrooms!",

I've always loved working with wood, because it's easy, affordable and you don't necessarily need special tools my latest project was my sauna, I refinished the panels and seats and all. All black. I'll post pics later in this sub. Next I'm gonna repurpose old cargo pallets into a deck for my backyard. We'll see how that turns out.\n\nBut for this guy?

Something little more see through would've been nicer, but I think I still would've gone for grey or... less black. \n\nThe \"paint\" is actually wax, or oil. I think it's paraffin-based. I've also been told, that paint won't stick in a sauna, propably because of the heat expansion, which you mentioned. This stuff is specifically made for saunas, and it's been popular here in Finland for ages. So I guess it'll stay looking nice. This is the first one I've ever done, or had for myself.\n\nAnd for practicality, this should make the wood last longer. Especially the seats, that tend to rot, if not treated. I'm under the impression, that the seats should be treated in anycase. I guess most times people just use the clear stuff. These had been treated, but only on the top surface.",

If a bag lands on the board but does not go in, it remains on the board, and can act as a blocker.\n\n\nAt the end, you tally up the score, 1 point for a bag on the board, 3 points for in the hole. Points cancel out, so you add the difference to the team who scored more points' total.\u00a0\n\n\nOn top of that, to win the game, you need 21 points, exactly.\u00a0The rules differ, but usually if you go over, you go back down to 15 points and the next round starts.\u00a0\n\n\nThere's a lot more to it than just get the bag in the hole.\u00a0",

If your opponent has left a bag in your way, a slide up the board could knock theirs in.\u00a0\n\n\nYou can try to land higher up the board, drop it directly into the hole, or even get the bag to somersault over or around the obstacle. All different throws.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso when you have more than 18 points, you can't hit a bucket without going over, you have to land a bag on the board. That's 1 more kind of throw.\u00a0",

            "one bag, one throw. that's it. Most boring game ever. I'm going to play korfbal now, bye.",
            "You attempt to block them from sliding into the hole. It's significantly harder to just drop it in the hole.\n\nFor example, in basketball, using the backboard vs. just trying to shoot for the hoop itself is usually easier and more likely to score",

            "You lack reading comprehension skills",

            "First, the edit came later. And second. Do you not realize that one of them could \"throw\" their shot in an attempt to block the other? I know if I played against someone who slid every shot in and I was capable of doing it, too, I would place one up close, so hopefully, they overthrow or better yet, they push mine in. Is it a risk? Sure, but it's either try something new or tie every time. My reading comprehension is fine. It's you not understanding basic sports strategy that is the issue.\n\n\nCome back when you actually have something to say other than a weak ass attempt at an insult. Lol",
            "Man all those people lack reading comprehension... If you make every shot there's nothing on the board to block...",
            "Have y'all considered the possibility of not making a shot *on purpose*. They're clearly accurate but if they wanted to actually win by getting more bags than the other person, there is strategy they can use. Notice that the shots don't sink straight in, they hit the board first and then slide.\n\nExample: \n\n- Player A, 1st bag: aims for just behind the hole, bag is left on the board.\n- B1st: aims to go in the hole, but PA's 1st bag is in the way of the slide they need to get it in. PA's first bag gets hit and goes in the hole while PB's sits there.\n\nThen, they can repeat this process with each knocking in their opponent's bag.\n\nAt the end of the game, player A will have 4 bags in the hole whereas player B will only have 3, making A the winner. Of course this is a simple example and it probably won't always work as planned but it just goes to show how even two people with great aim can bring strategy into this if they actually want to have a chance of winning instead of tying."
