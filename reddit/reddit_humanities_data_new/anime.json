I do think that Gintoki vs Takasugi is probably in my top 3 anime fights - not for it's animation (which is good but I wouldn't call it *outstanding*), but for its sheer emotional weight. I can safely say that there aren't a lot of fights (that I've seen) that [have felt as utterly soul-crushing](https://i.imgur.com/rCqN5Ih.jpeg) as this did. Also, while I wouldn't say Takasugi has been redeemed, I think this episode did a *masterful* job at making his motivations clearer and him as a character more understandable. He might be evil, but it's hard to really blame him!<...\n\ntl;dr - it is the best arc in the entire show (so far!) and I haven't even finished it yet lol.\n\nu/KendotsX u/Shocketheth u/Shimmering-Sky [](#forgotkeys)",

Sure but you can tell the people who made it really cared about it and despite only having 12 episodes they did their best to tell a coherent story and even had a double length premiere and finale as well as cut the OP for most episodes. The characters were likeable and the their found family dynamic was very believable given the circumstances, the mystery was quite interesting and the answers were rewarding, the themes of identity, humanity and knowledge were compelling  and it also had one of the most satisfying endings I've seen which is a rare feat in of itself.",

Am I supposed to assume Thorfinn willingly didn't go back to seek revenge or that one dude tries getting Thorfinn but Bjord or Askaladd halted him?!< Does this get answered? I just need a yes or no.

At both the beginning and end of last episode, Nina said to herself \"Momoka... I'm not in the wrong\", which is the first sign that she is not as confident as she appears to be. Then after learning about the band duel this episode, she talked about feeling tired and upset by \"the world of adults\". Finally, in front of that shrine she gave a pep talk but it was basically \"trust me, bro, we'll be fine\", without any concrete facts and numbers to back up. So the show fast forwarded to the new song release, and Nina now faces the biggest crisis in her music career...!<",

Him not being dragged by one of his Icelandic mates back to the ship while profuslouly crying doesn't cut it for me. I totally get his strong will to get revenge for his father by any means, that's how he should feel, but the way its being carried out doesn't sit right with me.!< Based on how heralded the series is, I'm assuming the mangaka has something up their sleeve for the long game.",

Their statement just didn\u2019t sit right with me:\n\n1. It implies that GBC has achieved something that no anime ever had, which just isn\u2019t true.\n2. And this supposed superiority is misleading too as GBC had its fair share of drama earlier on.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m just looking too deep into this and being annoying nitpicker (I didn\u2019t even really want to write my previous comment for this reason), but I really can\u2019t stand misinformation being spread like this - even if it wasn\u2019t on purpose.",
            "Eh, I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill. Something like [VL]>!Thorfinn going back, then sneaking onto Askeladd's ship before either of them embark again!< is entirely plausible.",
            "I mean that would be plausible to some degree and I do get how I could just be overthinking this whole situation. But then the end of episode 9 happened and made me want to start flipping tables again lol. Specifically [VL spoiler] >!Thorfinn telling Thorkell he's the son of Thors and Thorkell being intrigued and wanting to know more but then Thorfinn just dips and swims away with his vast amount of injuries instead of possibly joining him and England to begin a new revenge path.!< But maybe I'm just mad that things aren't happening the way I want them to and I shouldn't be dictating how things are supposed to go."

If you want to make this subreddit a better place, then please apply and let us know why you would be a good fit for our team!\n\nIf you're interested in applying, you should take a minute to take a look at our [mod page](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/mods) to see how we organize ourselves as well as the [rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/rules), as some questions that appear on the application will refer to them. If you have any further questions feel free to ask in this thread!\n\n# Responsibilities\n\nModerators of [/r/anime](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime) are expected to be able to execute most Reddit moderating tasks, as we don't have any divisions or specialist roles on the team. There are other optional responsibilities, like managing CSS and bots, but that's going above and beyond the base requirements.\n\nA large part of what we do is review reports on posts and comments and remove them if they break the rules of [/r/anime](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime) or Reddit in general, along with potentially banning users that have repeatedly or egregiously broken the rules. We're also expected to review and reply to moderator mail sent from users to answer questions and handle appeals for removals or bans.\n\nAside from that, we're in frequent communication with each other in our Discord server about the above as well as the future path of the subreddit, and want new moderators to be involved in our discussions as well.\n\n# Application\n\n[**Fill out the application here!**](https://forms.gle/g795TJabYS3p9Sj26)\n\nThe form will be open until [11:59 PM UTC on June 22](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/vote?iso=20240622T1159&p0=1440&font=cursive&csz=1) before we move on to review applications, and we will reach out to those chosen to become new moderators in late June. *Take your time to come up with thoughtful responses, as low effort applications will be discarded.*\n\nIf you happened to stumble across this post without knowing a lot (maybe browsing for subreddits that are recruiting mods), we really want people who are interested in *anime,* and not just the moderator role, since a lot of what we do requires having some knowledge of various series for context. Previous moderation experience isn't necessary, but we're also hoping that applicants are frequent visitors or participants of our subreddit and have at least a general understanding of how it currently functions.\n\nSo if you think you would make a good moderator for [/r/anime](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime), now's your chance! Recruiting new mods is always a very exciting process - [so we hope to see you join us soon!](https://i.imgur.com/f0QsBb5.png)",

            "Love that Dabi's biggest complaint of Shoto is how despite being his brother and Endeavour's son he chose to make friends in UA instead of training hard alone.\n\nIt's also telling that before the tournament with Deku, Shoto too had one goal of becoming stronger than his dad at any cost.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk \"Todoroki family and their genetic urge to be the last man standing\"",
            "\u201cThis week on *Keeping Up With the Todorokis*: Local man is literally too angry to die\u201d",
            "I honestly kind of pity Dabi. He couldn\u2019t control his powers and it almost killed him. Imagine being hurt by your own body\u2026 wtf. All the guy wanted was to make his dad proud. Straight up broke him and now he\u2019s literally driven by rage and resentment. Endeavor really made a monster. \n\nShoto was getting his ass beat so bad he had to do a little mid action monologuing/soul searching to fight the guy haha. Guy\u2019s fueled by the Power of Friendship too. It\u2019s the most OP quirk lol.",
            "Endeavor messed up Toya\u2019s mental state so bad that even All For One gave up on manipulating him. Even the Demon Lord himself couldn\u2019t penetrate the hold that Endeavor had on Toya\u2019s mind. Says a lot. Endeavor may not have been able to surpass All Might, but he was able to surpass All For One at one thing: fucking up a kid\u2019s mind.\n\nAnd we also get confirmation that Dabi saw his endeavor against his family as a suicide mission. He doesn\u2019t value his life at all because he has been conditioned to see himself as a failure because he wasn\u2019t able to fulfill the purpose of his birth. Endeavor neglecting him after giving him so much attention when drilling into him how important surpassing All Might was only served to make Toya feel like his existence was pointless. \n\nShoto vs. Dabi essentially operates as a more extreme Deku vs. Shoto. He\u2019s trying to get Toya to cool down and stop him from killing himself and hurting others, and he does that by fully accepting himself by uniting both sides of his quirk. Instead of constantly putting a dividing line between his mother and father, he embraces all of himself to complete his quirk. He\u2019s created a unique technique that is perfect against fire users. The development of Shoto\u2019s cold flames is interesting to theorize about as he improves his Flashfire Fist: Phosphor.",

I know Endeavour is now paying for his sins but seeing what his abuse has turned Toya into makes me feel like it's not enough. \n\nSo if I understood this correctly, Toya is supposed to be a backup for All For One just in case Shigaraki didn't work out but [because Toya is so fixated on Endeavour](https://i.imgur.com/B7u4e39.png), he wasn't able to control him and they just gave up. Also did [Toya burn down that orphanage?](https://i.imgur.com/yo0lImU.jpeg) Christ. Those kids are fucked anyway since they were all going to end up as All For One's pawns. \n\nNot gonna lie, [watching Dabi go completely wild against Shoto](https://i.imgur.com/3FVRqMp.jpeg) was pretty damn cool. Not as cool as [Shoto's new power though.](https://i.imgur.com/xeXeb37.jpeg) That's [one big baddie down!](https://i.imgur.com/MSApncz.jpeg) I'm guessing that Dabi is still alive?

            "I have not read the manga but this episode had a lot of chances to have a more spectacular fight. Endeavour fighting the Nomu is one of my favourite battles, the musical theme adds to the flavour, and I was kinda expecting the same \"body falling apart\" epicness levels here (actually, how Dabi degrades is top).\n\n\n\nIt is an okay episode though and the added context for Dabi is also entertaining.",
            "I wonder how long before anime industry moves on from this flashbacks during mid fight things. Like yes this was an overall great episode but id be lying if i expected a much longer fight than what we got.\n\nI was expecting Deku vs Todoroki or All might vs All for one or endevour vs nomu level of action since they dedicated an entire episode on this fight and even relesed a special key visual for it. But like 80% of the episode was internal monologe, flashbacks and charging up the power and talk between two brothers.\n\nAgain, i dont mind these things but the ratio between these things and the actual fight is not right. If you are gonna spend that amout of time building up these two charachter's fight, atleast make it worth it and dont end it in 2-3 moves.",
            "Not only Toya was saved by AFO but he could have been \"another\" Shigaraki if AFO had managed to reach out to him. The special \"privileges\" he seemed to enjoy when he first joined the League of Villains also make sense now. How many other kids have gone into Dr. Garaki's grinder... (I think back about the mini Nomu)\n\nThat Mr. Sunny looked so idiotic and creepy at the same time.\n\nI once wondered how things could have changed if that day Endeavor went to Sekoto Peak, and now, what if he noticed someone was watching his brutal training of Shoto, not realizing he was, right that moment, causing Dabi to be born?\n\nShoto managing that special move is symbolical of him reaching inner peace.\n\nAlso, a naked Iida wasn't in my cards.",

He\u2019s truly proof a tragic backstory doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t pure evil, he literally endangered, if not killed those other kids burning down that orphanage.

            "Keeping up with the Todoroki\u2019s is BY FAR the best plot in the story\n\n- Dabi seeing Endeavour training Shoto even after 3 years basically made Dabi think \nEndeavour \u201coh no my son died\u2026.. anyway Shoto back to training.\u201d\n\n- Dabi praying to his own alter was some next level imagery. Endeavour believes he killed Toya when Dabi was the one who figuratively killed Toya in the end. \n\n- As Endeavour always watched All Might, Dabi always watched him.  They both are so determined to reach their goal and will do anything to attain it. Dabi inherited Endeavour\u2019s drive but he also inherited his demons.\n\n- Dabi was too angry to die but now he\u2019s too angry to live.  He joined the League of Villains cause it\u2019d be the best spot for his death.  \n\n- Shoto calling Dabi out; he understands him more than anyone in this world but he must atone for the sins he\u2019s committed\n\n- Dabi was so insane and traumatized that even All for One didn\u2019t want him. He was probably thinking \u201cyou broke this child more than I ever could, how did you possibly do that.\u201d",
            "I get they didn't expect dabi to live long, but you'd think if AFO cut his loss on the kid and the guy still pops up one day maybe actually kill him this time since he can't be controlled you know. The guy even said straight up I'm on a suicide mission and they still kept him around?  I'm sorry league of villains y'all deserve everything that y'all get for this dabi oversight.",

            "Pity is the right word. My sympathy for him was burnt down alongside that orphanage. He almost certainly killed several of those innocent kids, who were just as much victims as him. Furthermore, he acknowledged the things he did/said to his family was awful, even if he had more reason to be pissed at Endeavor, there\u2019s no reason to be okay with killing then for his goal. \u00a0\n\nTodoroki said it perfectly, he wasn\u2019t groomed like Shigaraki or anything like that, choosing to murder was his own decision.",

Shigaraki is evil but a traumatized kid lashing out at the world.
