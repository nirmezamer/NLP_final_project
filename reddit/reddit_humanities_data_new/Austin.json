Feel free to use this post to:\n\n* Ask where to live\n* What neighborhood is right for you\n* Advice on apartments / asking about specific apartment reviews\n* General thoughts/views on the housing market\n* Questions about real estate prices/going up/general home buying advice\n* Advice on realtors\n* General property questions rants/complaints about pricing\n* \"Is this neighborhood safe\" questions / crime related questions\n* Tax / Mortgage related questions\n* Questions on developments / bidding processes\n* Have a place to rent / looking for a roommate\n* Commute times from specific locations\n* General housing repair questions / upgrade questions / solar / etc\n* Questions regarding contractors for housing repairs, upgrades\n* Memes regarding housing\n* How specific schools are in an area / general school questions\n* Questions regarding utilities\n* Questions regarding apartment services\n\nOver the last year, we have seen a major uptick in prices in the area, along with a steady flow of new people coming into Austin. Use this weekly post to ask your questions, try to get advice, etc on an upcoming move or questions about real estate in Austin.\n\nMany apartment questions have always been removed on here, and we always suggest people to contact an apartment locator. Those rules still stand. But, you are welcome to ask those questions on here if you still feel the need for it.\n\nAlong with that, any new open ended question on Austin properties and real estate will be removed and asked to move to here (based on mod discretion).  Many of the questions being asked have been asked many times before, which is why we would rather compile these posts into one place for people to ask and get their answers.\n\nIf you are having issues as a tenant in Austin, we highly recommend reaching out to the Austin Tenants Council here: [https://www.housing-rights.org/](https://www.housing-rights.org/). They may be able to help you resolve issues related to renting property in Austin.\n\nWe also recommend searching older \"Weekly Real Estate\" posts as well, to find answers on previous week's questions.\n\nAs always, there is a whole section on moving to Austin in our FAQ page:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/wiki/movingtoaustin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/wiki/movingtoaustin)",

Couple that with new construction everywhere. Renters have a lot of power right now!",

            "110k alone is more than most families make. Unless you have debt to pay off, i think redditors have some form of financial dysmorphia. You could easily rent a one bedroom apartment. They usually start around $1500/mo in the suburbs to probably starting around $2200-2700 near downtown. Assuming mid-to-nice apartments.\n\nBuying a home would be a different story considering how prices and mortgage rates are.",
            "To an extent yes, but it doesn\u2019t affect SFHs near as much. LLs in desired areas will still hold out for higher prices. They don\u2019t have the pressure of keeping a building with hundreds of units occupied. However, if you see that something has been on the market for 30+ days, I\u2019d be asking for a lower price!",
            "It\u2019s definitely a spectrum. The cheaper side you can get in for $1,300-$1,600 at some places. The higher end spots will likely start at $1,700 and top out around $2,400ish. The deals are there for the taking. I\u2019m seeing a lot of 8 weeks free stuff going on, which if you self prorate you can get that price down even lower. Just remember that the deal only lasts for a year and your rent will increase without the weeks free going in to the next year. Hope this helps!",
            "Thanks for your input.",
            "Yeah thats what i thought and i assume the 8 week free is only on a minimum 1 year lease \n\nI made sure my current least ends in jan so that i can sign the lowest possible rent when i renew or move. At least thats what i see, rents in dec, jan were lower than now.",
            "No problem and i hope i didnt come off rude regarding financial dysmorphia\n\nAdditionally regarding homes, youll need to do the math but it seems tough to make things cash flow unless you put a lot down",
            "Oh yeah, fall/winter is going to be the best time to rent. Summer being the worst."
