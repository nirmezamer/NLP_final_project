        "content": "I (M26) and four years ago, everything changed for me. My childhood best friend,(F25), was in a really tough spot. She was pregnant, the father left her, and she had nowhere to go. We've been close since we were kids, and I couldn't just watch her struggle, so I took her in.\n\nAt first, it was supposed to be temporary, but over time, we got really close. I helped her through her pregnancy, was there when her daughter was born, and eventually, we fell in love. Now, they feel like my family, and I love them both very much. Her daughter even calls me \"daddy,\" which means the world to me.\n\nA few months ago, I started thinking about proposing to her. It might not be the usual way things happen, but I'm sure about my feelings and want to make our family official. When I told my parents, they weren't happy. They think I should focus on starting my own family from scratch and that my best friend and her daughter aren't part of that plan. They say I'm giving up my future for something that's not my responsibility.\n\nI've tried to explain that they are my family now and I love them deeply, but my parents are convinced I'm making a mistake. They say I'm too young to take on such a big commitment and should be with someone who doesn't have \"baggage.\"\n\nThis whole thing has caused a big fight between us. I do care about my parents' opinions, but I can't imagine my life without my best friend and her daughter. They've brought so much joy and purpose to my life, and I want to be there for them as a husband and father. I don\u2019t feel bad about this decision at all.\n\n",

            "How many years have you been openly dating during the 4 years? Or is this a recent relationship?",
            "No you're not wrong. You're an adult. You can do what you want. \n\nYour parents might not ever come around and you just have to come to terms with that.",
            "Are you both officially dating? How long have you been together. I remember reading another post about a girl whose best friend proposed to her when in her mind they had never even dated before. Don't let that be you",
            "Your parents are 100% wrong.\n\nFour years ago, maybe it was true that your friend had some baggage - and you stepped up and help her carry it, and now it\u2019s just a dusty suitcase shoved away in the attic.  This is someone that you cherish and support, and it\u2019s been that way for more than a little while.  You might not have written the source code for the child in your life, but so what - you\u2019re helping raise her, and she looks up to you.  (It\u2019s not like you just met this person who happens to have a 4 year old.). You\u2019ve had 4 years to think about it, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re rushing in to anything.\n\nGo for it.",
            "Er you aren't wrong but please clear something up for me. You guys are and have been dating for a while? I know that sounds like a obvious answer but you constantly refer to her as your best friend and not like a gf. So if you just throwing out a marriage without even doing the whole dating thing than you might be wrong.",
            "I wish I could connect you with my amazing stepdad. The man that I have always called dad, starting from 2.5 years old. \n\nHe made a similar decision as you are/have been almost 41 years ago. \n\nHe married a woman with a kid. Someone who came with baggage and why would he want to raise someone else's kids (never mind that she had married her 2nd husband when my dad was a kid still, so technically she had baggage too? She has never made sense) was all his mom could ask. \n\nHe told her that he chose to be my dad, no one was forcing him to be my dad, it was what he to be. He has always loved me and treated me as his daughter, just like he has with my younger sister. \n\nHe told her to stop with her bullshit (only nicer than that) and that if she had a problem with it, then it was just that, her problem. \n\nYou get to choose who you love and marry. You get to choose if you want to be that child's dad, not your parents. \n\nThey can choose to be assholes or they can choose to follow your lead and support you marrying the person you love, baggage and all.",
            "Marry her and adopt the little one if you can, Only you know how you feel and it sounds like your where your suppose to be.",
            "Question: Are you in a romantic relationship with your best friend? If not, maybe don't propose. Talk to her and find out what she wants out of your relationship, whether it's romantic, or platonic. From what you've said here, there's no sign of a  two-sided romantic relationship. If you propose to her without you both being on the same page, you could end up losing them in your life by blindsiding a proposal she isn't at all expecting.",
            "Before you propose, do feel her out.   Make sure the two of you are on the same page.  If you are,  then your parents opinion is irrelevant.",
            "Ask your best friend about her interest in dating to begin with. As to your parents, any digs, insulting tones or comments or even bad body language you walk away or hang up. Don\u2019t engage. Don\u2019t discuss, just excuse yourself and leave. They will catch on eventually and you get a less stressful environment either way. Win for you, loss for them until they smarten up.",
            "You are a GROWN MAN.  If you love this woman and her child, then it sounds like you are in a good place. It sucks that your parents can't be happy for you, but you are driving this bus, Bud. I would at least hear them out in case they have noticed something you haven't, but it's not up to them. I would let them know that you are moving forward despite their advice, and if they want to be part of your lives, then they better get on board.",
            "Nta. And definitely if the father isn't involved,  adopt your daughter.  Congratulations.  Best friends make the best spouses. Just maintain that friendship. 24 years later I'm married to my best friend. You're 26. A man. You know what you want. Go do it.",
            "NTA! \n\nCongratulations on finding the love of your life and becoming a dad. \n\nIt may not be the  conventional way your parents are used to, but that's 100% OK. Things have changed.\n\nThe next conversation with them is im not asking for your permission. I love x and love MY little girl. This is my family. You can either get on board or see my life from a distance your choice. But, I need you get over the fact that my future wife already had a child that is not mine biologically but 100% mine in all the ways that matter. \n\n\nAlso, if your daughters dad isn't in the picture, maybe think about adopting her. \n\nEither way. If your parents can't get on board . Move on and live your want to live.",
            "You are not wrong. My oldest grandson is not related to me by biology. He is not related to my son by biology. It has never mattered to my son, and it has never mattered to me. My son was there to support her during her pregnancy, and he has been there to be his Dad every step of the way. Biology does not make you a  Daddy. Stepping up like you did makes you a Daddy. That is your family, that is your daughter. If your parents can not accept that, that is their problem. They will miss out. The best day of my sons life was when he was able to adopt his son and make it official by law, he was already the son of his heart.",
            "You're correct to ignore your parents on this.  But you need to be careful in assessing how your friend feels.  Unfortunately, she might not be interested in romance or marriage, either in general or with you, and you don't want her to marry you out of gratitude or for stability.  While you've been a pseudo-couple for a while, it doesn't sound like you've ever actually dated.  A proposal out of nowhere is going to put a strain on your relationship, and may frighten her.  Try a date first (and hire a babysitter) and see how it goes.",
            "When friends fall in love that\u2019s the best kind of relationship. Because you have that strong foundation and know each other so well already. That\u2019s much more natural than dating someone and falling that way. Your parents should just want you to be happy. But also I\u2019m sure they just are looking out for your best interests. But you do what\u2019s in your heart",

That\u2019s wrong.\n\nAssuming you do this, impress upon your parents the need to treat your daughter as their granddaughter.\n\nYou stepping up for this young girl marks you as a man.",

How dare they call you daughter \"baggage?!?\" She and your girlfriend don't just feel like family, they ARE your family, regardless of paternity and marital status.

They\u2019re closed minded and this is a family no matter how it came to be. \nYou do what you think is right and I wish you all the best of luck! \nIf you do decide to propose, please keep us posted, I can\u2019t speak for everyone else but I would love to hear an update. \ud83d\ude42",

I know you said we fell in love but is it actually official or just when at home ?? Sounds like the parents don't feel like you are actually a couple or have been for the past 4yrs. \n\nIf you both are on the same page & actually in love & want to build a life together YES go for it who cares what your parents say or think.\nBut if it is one-sided & you love them both but she still sees it as you are still her best friend that took her in & not actually dating or in a relationship DON'T DO IT , it could end very badly, friendship over , her & child move out with no contact. Don't be that guy who read it wrong and thought you were together when she doesn't or has never seen you in that way. Just because you feel it when at home have sx & so on, what are you both like out in public.",
            "Not wrong. I got married at 25, baby at 26 and honestly? Wouldn't change that for the world.  So what if it's a bit reverse order? My sisters have \"reverse\" order too, kids first,  spouse second (one never married.  She has a life partner)\n\nYour parents have pretty much just told you \"well, you may love those 2 but we want you to know *she'll* never be our granddaughter to us and her mom isn't good enough for you\" who needs that toxicity in your life? \n\nGo, marry your love, adopt that sweet little angel and *thrive* just as you've clearly been doing without them the last 4 years. And if it falls apart in 5, 10, 50 years? So what? Bet that doesn't mean you'll love that little girl any less. You may not be her biological parent, but you've raised her and loved her just the same. And you're going to prove to them that family is what you make it, it's most certainly not bound by blood.",
            "INFO: have you always been in love with her?\n\nI ask because, not wrong if this would be a marriage of equals who were friends who then fell in love but could be wrong if the romantic love is one-sided. If you are sure that both your feelings are true and at the same level, then good luck to you. If they are not, then you risk both your own heartbreak and losing your friend.  Not trying to be harsh, just not enough info to know the answer to the above.\n\n I think your parents are wrong about you being too young. You have proven you are not, but they could be looking out for you if they feel the love is one-sided.\n\nGood luck whatever you choose. I hope you are both (all 3) super happy.",
            "Of course you can do what you want but your parents are right. It\u2019s fine either way but your life will be less complicated if you start your own family.",
            "Sounds like a beautiful love story to me.  Children don't have to share your DNA to be family. Follow your heart.",
            "Op you're not wrong at all, but your parents are. You've already proved you are a great partner and father, and together, you can have more children when you're both ready. \n\nI think marrying your best friend is wonderful. Best friends can make the best life partners because the relationship's foundation is a genuine appreciation of the others' personality and not based on lust and physical attraction. \n\nI was so blessed my MIL did not discriminate me because I was a young single mother when I met her son. She's been a wonderful grandmother and has never treated my oldest any different to the blood related children I had in that marriage. I fear however your parents will be unable to do so and may potentially emotionally damage that child. He's not baggage!!!!\n\nI'd make it very clear what the result will be should they continue expressing such opinions.",

We got married and at the wedding reception my dad gave a speech about how he was wrong for, the reasons why, it's not gonna work, etc. Well guess what? Monday is our 24th wedding anniversary. So I say go for it!",
            "Is she your best friend or your girlfriend? Seems like you're being led on. What happens when she finally gets on her feet? What happens when the father decides he wants to be part of then picture? Look out for you, pal.\u00a0",
            "No not wrong but I would be taking a long engagement due to the fact you both are still young.\nAre you trying for kids yourself? \nI get where the parents are coming from but if you love them what's wrong with an extra grandchild?",
            "Sounds like you've got a good thing going on.\nDefinitely NTA,\nYour parents can grow up and realise, as an adult, they don't have a say in your love life.\n\n100% propose to your best friend and partner.",
            "Talk to your girlfriend about how she sees the future before you propose. Make sure you're on the same page.",
            "This is odd. Why are you calling them \"my best friend\" and \"her daughter\" and not \"my girlfriend\" and \"our daughter/my step daughter\". Maybe this is where your parents have a disconnect. Maybe they think you're not as in love as you say because they don't see it. Actions speak louder than words. Marry her and adopt the kid and tell them they're welcome to be happy for you and enjoy their step granddaughter if they promise to be nothing but loving and accepting.",
            "Your parents are being assholes",

Sounds like you\u2019ve got your own family now with the lady and the kid, so make it official if that\u2019s what you feel confident is what you want.  Sounds like a special relationship.",
            "You\u2019re not wrong and your parents sound like elitist asshats.\n\nI love how they referred to your impending proposal as: you should start from scratch like the woman and child you love are just garbage to be thrown away. \n\nSo my perspective is: you\u2019re already dad to your daughter  and you love your best friend so you\u2019re already living your best life You found someone you loved and you want to be with and you already have a child you love and you were there for the very beginning even before it got romantic so you had a chance to really grow in love with this person and mature together through the hard times.",
            "I think you should go for it, however, you will need to get your parents to accept your daughter as a grandchild, I can see them playing favorites if you have another child or a sibling has a child.",

            "Not wrong at all. You have made your own family from scratch that\u2019s literally what you did when you took on the commitment to them FOUR YEARS AGO!!! They are being ridiculous and cruel to all of you. You have raised this girl for four years, are in a relationship with her mother and she calls you dad. The ship has long since sailed on the appropriate moment for them to have this conversation or reveal they feel this way to you and it has your family on it. Good luck.",
            "It\u2019s not your responsibility but you\u2019re already playing husband and father? Are the years you\u2019ve been there for her and her kid, irrelevant? You can still have your own family if you both end up with a kid that\u2019s both of y\u2019all own",

            "Not wrong. Family is *what you make it*. Your biological family are being selfish and projecting their wishes on to you. If this lass and her child feel like family then *they are family*. Your biological family should support you in *what makes you happy*.",

            "I'll tell you my story \n\nMom was preyed on by a 19 yr old at 14. She ended up having my brother couple more years I came and sperm donor went to jail. During that time he abused my mom mentally, emotionally, and physically (for privacy/ not relevant keeping those events secret).\n\nShe met my dad the same year I was born they both were 18. He raised us as his own. The only difference is his parents my grandparents actually took us in. \n\nMoral of the story having a father figure even not biologically was the best thing the universe provided us. Especially since my sperm donor is a loser. I've never seen my dad be burdened by us. He always said his life started and felt whole is when he spot my mom at work and he met us. He always knew we were meant to be his family\n\nBeing there supporting her through pregnancy you already provided husband/father rolls, you experienced what a biological father would.  You also stepped up to the plate and that baby calls you dad. You have already started your family. If your not ready I do recommend stepping back and out of their lives, but if you're for sure than disregard your parents. Just make sure your vigilant at their treatment towards your daughter and any future children you have with your best friend. Especially biological, they'll start treating her different.",

But if you both feel you are ready to commit to each other, then go for it. But be prepared for the backlash and the possibility your parents won't accept your decision",

Your wife and daughter are IMMEDIATE FAMILY your parents are only extended family. You need to not ASK them for a damned thing anymore, but tell them: \"You are blowing any chance at a relationship with me and my little family moving forward. This is my wife and our daughter. Any kids that come later will be equal siblings. Go to therapy until you process that reality or you lose out on being included in our lives. Permanently.\"\n\nGo elope.

            "You\u2019re an adult.  Do what you want.",
            "Not wrong. It's a big commitment, both getting married and becoming a father to a child, one that isn't yours biologically at that. But you know your relationship with your best friend/gf and her kid way better than your parents do. You know how you feel about both of them. You're already 'daddy' to that little girl, it sounds like you're the only dad she knows. If you're sure you're in love with your gf and want to spend the rest of your life with her and be a dad to her little girl more officially, then go for it, propose.\n\nThat 'baggage' thing is annoying as hell, by the way. You're 26, everyone you meet and could date/marry at your age is going to have some sort of baggage, some will have children, others emotional trauma, everyone comes with at least one ex. The only way you could date someone without baggage of some kind is to only date women aged 18 and below, and a hell of a lot of them will have baggage too, not to mention the illegality of it if they're under 18. \n\nYour parents don't care if your gf has 'baggage', they care that she specifically has a kid that isn't yours. You're not too young to be a dad, you're 26, a lot pf people have kids at that age, plenty have them younger. So, that's not the issue, either. It's literally only about the fact the existing child isn't your biological child. It's not like that child existing would prevent you from having biological children, if you both want kids together, I'm sure you'll have at least one that's biologically yours. You can also adopt that little girl, making her legally your daughter, not just emotionally. \n\nYour parents get exactly zero say in your relationship. If you want to marry and be a dad to that girl, do it. But you may need to be very strict with boundaries going forward, if not go LC/NC. It doesn't sound like your parents will ever accept your gf as a DIL, and they'll never accept that little girl as family. There will likely be a very obvious difference in treatment if you have biological kids in the future. You need to be aware of the issues your parents can cause if you go ahead, and work out, with your partner, how to deal with them as a unit. You'll need to fully stand up for your partner and that child against your parents. You may need to seriously consider going LC/NC if your parents don't change. Even financially, your parents aren't going to help you pay for a wedding they don't support, so you'll be o the hook without help on that one. Stuff like that.\n\nI'm not saying this to convince you not to propose, just so that you're aware of the obstacles your parents are likely to throw in your path, so you can do your best to be prepared to deal with them going forward. You do what's best for you, and that may end up marrying the girl, adopting her child, but completely cutting off your parents. That's worst case scenario for if you go through with this, and hopefully your parents will change their minds when they realise how happy you are and how much you love your little family. But think about all the potential outcomes and plan with your gf how to deal with each one. Hope for the best but plan for the worst.",

Coming from a widow with parents who completely disapproved of my marriage because it wasn't someone they chose for me, I would do it all over again, happily. This is your life.

You can always have more children together, but be honest with yourself about whether you will be able to treat your adopted children and biological children the same before going this direction. If you want more kids / bio kids, and you are sure you can treat them the same than do not marry. \n\nFinally expect that at some point your daughter might want a relationship with her bio father even if he's a POS and even if you treat her great.

From the jump, we clicked on so many levels she's hilarious, smart, and we share a lot of interests. After a few great dates, I thought we might really have something special.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, Sarah sat me down and shared something important\u2014she has a 3-year-old son. She had him when she was young, and the father isn't involved at all. She told me she has a solid support system and manages everything well, but honestly, I was caught off guard. I hadn\u2019t even considered the possibility that she might be a mom.\n\nI took a few days to think it over and realized that I\u2019m just not ready for that kind of responsibility. It's not that I have anything against her or her son\u2014it's just that I\u2019m still figuring out my own life. I knew I had to be honest with her, so we met up for coffee.\n\nI told her, as gently as I could, that while I think she's amazing, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to be involved with someone who has a child. I explained that it's more about where I am in my own life and less about her or her son. She seemed to understand, but I could tell she was hurt and disappointed.\n\nLater, our mutual friend told me that Sarah felt really judged and hurt by my decision. She said it was unfair to dismiss her just because she's a single mom and that I should have given it more of a chance.\n\nNow I\u2019m feeling really conflicted. On one hand, I believe it\u2019s better to be upfront about my feelings rather than leading her on. But on the other hand, I hate the idea that I might have made her feel bad about something she can\u2019t control.\n\n",

He told her he needed to get his shit together first and that it wasn't fair to us that he was still kind of an idiot as an adult (now an adult myself, I understand where he was coming from). He was honest and they parted amicably and we both are so grateful that he had the emotional maturity to do what he did. \n\nI think you made the right move. I think she's obviously going to feel hurt because hey, rejection sucks. She's more than likely going to be glad you were honest later though, kids can tell when someone doesn't want them around. Not to say you'd make her kid feel like that, but if you're dating a single parent, their kids are part of the package. If you aren't ready to be a parent or if you don't want to be one right now, that's ok. Your mutual friend shouldn't have made you feel bad for being honest. AND you did it sooner rather than later, which I think is pretty admirable.",

It's not your fault you are not ready to take care of a child. And it makes sense, because you are young. She doesn't have that choice so it's just hard on her. \n\nIf your friend was the one who ser you up with her, she should've told you from the start that she had a child. The friend knew she did. They both hoped that you would be OK with being a father. She can say all she wants that she won't expect you to ake care of the child at all. But it will happen. And she might honestly be looking for a father for her child. You don't know.\n\nSo if you're not ready to be any kind of father figure, then this is a mismatch and it's best you figured that out now. It's on her to try and find someone who is ready to be around a child. That or she should find someone who also has a child that shared interest can be a good thing for her.",

You were blindsided, but handled it with absolute class by first reflecting, and then acting on those reflections. You were the most mature one in this scenario. The single mom is bitter, but more with herself, not you, for making a choice at a young age that she doesn't want to face now.

            "You're not wrong. While it didn't seem like there were any issues in your relationship, its ultimately up to you if you're up for dating a single mother and, in the future, being a father to her child. Also remember that it wasn't something she can't control: she chose to have a baby with another man. While the outcome of her previous relationship may have been out of her control, it doesn't change the fact that being a single parent can make dating harder and she just had to accept that.",
            "You would have done a lot more harm to both her and her child if you\u2019d dragged things out, knowing this wasn\u2019t what you wanted. I\u2019m sure dating is hard as a single mom, but she should not want to be with someone who\u2019s not ready for kids.",
            "No. What's unfair is getting involved with someone with a kid if you aren't absolutely sure you are ready, or even want, that. I've seen the effects of having a step parent that didn't want to be a step parent - it's not good. It's unfair to you, the mother, and the child to continue.",
            "As a mom who raised her kids alone you are not wrong. That\u2019s the first thing she should have told you.  You didn\u2019t need to meet the kid any time soon but you should have known before starting anything. What she did isn\u2019t fair to you at all.",
            "I was a single mom for 7 years, and honestly it's better when you're up front. I understand why she's hurt, but you did you both a favour.",

            "It\u2019s good that you were honest so she can move on and find someone that does want a kid now. If your not ready it\u2019s so much better to be honest",
            "As a former single mom I would have rather been told like you did than led on. You do t have to feel bad nor be ready to be involved in a small child\u2019s life.",
            "Look she started off by not telling you and waited till you were about to catch feelings for her to bring up \u201cthe kid\u201d.  It wasn\u2019t idea but the truth",
            "You are not wrong. You made a decision based on your comfort level and your ability/want to be a parent. It had nothing to do with Sarah. It was your decision based on your availability for that next step. And that's okay. \n\nSarah doesn't realize, yet, that she dodged a bullet/waste of time. You are not ready to be a parent. She's already a parent. You are not compatible. Simple math. That may change; but right now it is your truth.",
            "No. Gawd no. Never get involved with a single parent if you don't think you can handle it. It hurts mom and kiddo so so so much in the long run. \n\nThank you.",

Can you imagine convincing yourself you are ready for this type of responsibility only to get deeper into a situation you aren\u2019t prepared to commit to? It would be horrible for you, her, and her child. This is the best decision you could have made at this particular time in your life\u2014for all of you.",
            "You\u2019re not wrong at all. Asking you to continue dating her knowing that she\u2019s a single mom is essentially asking you to be her kid\u2019s dad eventually, and that\u2019s a really fucking big ask.",
            "You\u2019re not wrong at all, honestly in my opinion it was wrong of her to go on ANY dates without disclosing she has a child. It\u2019s good to know your own limitations. \n\nShe has to be realistic that at 23 most people she meets are not gonna want the responsibility of a child, and it\u2019s not fair to her child to try to shoehorn someone into their lives if they aren\u2019t enthusiastic about the possibility of being a step-Dad. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re \u201cjudging\u201d her, it\u2019s just not what you want in your life right now and that\u2019s a very valid reason that has no moral judgment on her \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I dated a guy who I moved in with eventually, only for him to dump me a few months later because he wasn\u2019t ready for the responsibilities. Being able to see that you\u2019re not ready for that now is much more mature, and who knows where your lives will take you!",
            "you ar enot wrong, but neither is she for being hurt. sometimes stuff just sucks",
            "Nope! You weren\u2019t judging her. You were being honest. You know that she\u2019s a packaged deal and you\u2019re not ready for that responsibility. After seeing so many evil stepparent stories on social media, you being upfront about that was the absolute right thing to do, even if it feels wrong. Better that than wasting her time (and yours for that matter) on a relationship that\u2019s probably going to struggle because you both have different life and future goals. Of course she\u2019s going to be upset and that\u2019s ok. That\u2019s just how it goes, even if you try and be as gentle as possible. But you are by no means wrong. You did her, her son, and yourself a favor",
            " Listen, if I ever became a single mom and had to go back out on dates, fine. Nobody would be meeting my kid for the longest, but NO WAY could I go longer than a few min without mentioning my kids. They are my whole life. In fact, I\u2019d prob have to make a point to be cognizant about not only speaking about them, so I\u2019m shocked she lasted as long as she did, keeping this \u201csecret.\u201d If I was a future mate, that would also make me concerned.",
            "I was the same age divorced with 2 little girls. When I dated I told the guy immediately that I had children. At that point in my life I wasn\u2019t looking for anything permanent but it\u2019s best to be upfront and honest from the start.",
            "You aren\u2019t wrong at all.  You have your preferences nd boundaries.  You were honest.  You let her know.  She has to accept that that is a reality.  Other guys may have the same preference.  Stay strong.  Updateme",
            "This is pretty much her asking you to be a father immediately cause you know that\u2019s how it\u2019s gonna work. The kid is young. He will latch to you. That\u2019s a lot of commitment for a child that isn\u2019t yours just to date a girl you haven\u2019t known for a long time. You\u2019re not wrong at all.",
            "Not wrong. You handled it well.",
            "I\u2019m proud of you for thinking everything through in an honest way. So many people dismiss their gut feelings. You are not wrong, and you did the right thing. If anything, Sarah was the one that was leading you on by not being upfront about the fact she had a child. There is nothing wrong with you not being ready and it\u2019s highly responsible of you to acknowledge that. I can see where it\u2019s hard for her to not take it personally but this is her situation, her responsibility, and she can\u2019t expect everyone to be on board. It really stinks when you have a connection with someone and then they drop a truth bomb on you that goes against where you are in your own life, or your feelings about something. You handled a difficult situation very well.",
            "She needs to be realistic.  She chose to become a mom and now most guys her age aren't going to want to date her.  What guy wants to spend his 20s raising some other dude's kid?  She should have brought it up on their first meeting.",
            "Not wrong.",

She is feeling judged because she didn\u2019t really listen to what you said and is making it all about her needs - \u2018If he really liked me he\u2019d put aside his own needs to meet mine\u2019 but in a good relationship the needs of both people are met. Don\u2019t feel bad. If SHE really likes YOU she\u2019ll accept your decision and move on.",

Not that I don\u2019t like their kids, but I did it once before in my early 20\u2019s and within a couple of months I was playing stepmom. Didn\u2019t mind, the kid was a darling but me and the guy broke up and I never saw the boy again. Hurt me more than the actual breakup and we only dated for 4-5 months or so. I imagine dating someone for years, investing time and money into their child then poof, relationship ends and you don\u2019t see them anymore. Not for me.",

And personally I think it's imeven more risky than having your own kids as you often take on the responsibility of the child with little to no authority, and often if the relationship doesn't work out down the road you will have built a strong bond, but have no rights at all and immediately be cut out.

When my child was young I was also a single mother and while people were aware of this fact, nobody met my kid unless we had been together a while and I knew he'd stick around.

In my opinion, she should have disclosed the fact she had a kid earlier on.  That way, you could have chosen to not date her before feelings got involved on either end.  It would have been worse if you basically led her on, feelings got deeper, and feelings got more hurt.\n\nAnd your friend is out of line.  Who you date is your business and ultimately your choice.  All of us have baggage and all of us have deal breakers.\n\nAs you said, you want to focus on your life and bringing a child into the mix can make things more complicated, especially for the child.

            "Not wrong.  Did that in the past dating single moms and you were always thrown to the side.",
            "No, if it's not for you, respect yourself and her. You'll all be miserable otherwise.  Honesty is best",
            "You handled it with maturity beyond your years. Well done.",
            "As someone who not only married single mom and then adopted her child (then we had another a few years later together), I'd say you did the absolutely correct thing to do. \n\nYou approached her with sympathy, honesty, and clarity. You evaluated where you were at in life and what you wanted in the present and knew you weren't ready to think about or take on parental responsibilities.  Dating a mother is also taking on their children as part of the relationship, and you weren't ready for that. \n\nYou did right by all parties involved and YNW.",
            "Not wrong.  You can not date anyone for any reason.  And this was done with maturity and self-awareness.  She is the immature one as she does not seem to understand that this will be a big thing when she is trying to date.",
            "Youre not wrong. Anyone who thinks you are is an idiot. \nThe fact is she made a choice, an adult choice, and like any other choice it will have positive and negative effects down the road. One negative is that it makes dating 10x harder cause most men arent willing to take on that responsibility which is not at all a bad thing",
            "As someone who dated a mom I can say that I will never do it again. Nothing against single moms but as a man who comes in and gets attached to the kid and then going thru the breakup it hurts way worse than a regular breakup cause you\u2019re losing more than one person that meant a lot to you. And that\u2019s just not something I wanna experience again.",
            "Nope. Not wrong. \n\nYou were up front and honest, and did not try to hurt her feelings. \n\nI would further point out that it\u2019s not like you said \u201cfuck no I\u2019d never date a single mother\u201d \n\nYou simply took stock of the new information, your situation, and recognized that you are not in a place currently where you can see that being your life. Which is absolutely your right to do so. \n\nUnfortunately, as Sarah is finding out, actions (even those made while young) have consequences. I\u2019m sure that it sucks to be in her shoes as a single mother and as a woman trying to find a romantic partner, but that\u2019s life.",

            "The friend who introduced you to her is the asshole for not having told you she is a single mother. For some people it is a deal breaker and should have been told from the get go. Same thing happened to me where I was introduced to a friend's friend to go on a date. My friend knows that a smoking man for me is a hard no. I just can't kiss someone who smokes, makes me gag litterally, so it is a hard no. Met the man, had supper things seems to be going fine until he pulled a pack and lighted it right as I was starting to eat my dessert. (On a terrace where I live you can smoke). We finished eating, I paid my tab and told him it wouldn't go further. \nNext day my friend told me I was rude, shallow and superficial (dub!) For letting his smoking get in the way of what could have been a great match. Nope! \nSame here. Your friend should have told you first that she is a single mom. Time saved for both parties.",
            "Even if it was a safety thing, she doesn\u2019t get to both hide important factors that may be dealbreakers for him AND get upset when that information comes to light & the relationship naturally ends. She has to accept her part in all of this; had she said she\u2019s a mother early on then she wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to get herself attached enough to him that his choice hurt her & made her feel judged. This is on her.",
            "No, not wrong. It's okay for her to be hurt. Nothing you can do about it.",
            "There is nothing wrong in what you told her. You are young and aren\u2019t looking for too much responsibility yet. You will be ready when you\u2019re ready.",

            "As a single mother who raised 2 kids alone I don't understand her attitude. My rule in dating was never to expose my kids to anyone I was dating until I knew it was going to last. I truly appreciate your honesty with her. Better now than after her kid gets attached. I don't think badly about you at all. You're being honest. You're not ready for a kid. You have nothing to feel bad about.",
            "No you\u2019re not. You did the right thing. Dodged a bullet and looked out for yourself first.\n\nDating a single mom isn\u2019t for the faint of heart.\n1. You\u2019re at best a fourth priority after her, her kid, work. \n2. If you date her long enough, I believe that she can argue that you provided a certain lifestyle and  you could be on the hook for child support.\n3. Do you really want to be with someone who didn\u2019t practice good judgement and got knocked up by a loser? There are tons of birth control out here, she didn\u2019t need to have this kid.\n4. Time is limited. You prepped to have your adult time interrupted by her kid? It\u2019s happened to me before.\n5. Do you REALLY want to grow attached to another man\u2019s kid?",
            "You handled it the best way possible. She waited to tell you because she wanted to make sure you were worth it. She's obviously disappointed because you're a good guy. It's just an unfortunate situation.",
            "You're not wrong!\nI've been a single mom for 20 years now.. and dating is rough. I was always upfront though about having kids. Lucky for me, my kids have always been my own (no baby daddy drama). But with the information about my kids already out there, whomever I am dating has their own informed choice to make. So I can understand why learning about them having a child would catch you off guard. I applaud you for taking time to really think about the whole situation. \n\nI read a comment that someone said your date could have just been venting to the friend and the friend could have shared something out of context or made it seem worse than it actually was when they relayed it to you. I think that is probably right.  I'm sure that she is probably bummed about it but still appreciated your honesty.",
            "OP, you\u2019re not wrong, and I appreciate your honesty with her. I only wish everyone could be honest in such a kind & respectful way. I\u2019m sorry she couldn\u2019t do the same for you. \n\nYou do not need to concern yourself with Sarah\u2019s inner struggle and whether you made her feel bad, because you did everything a good person would be expected to do in this situation, and I really mean that. That your honesty about your limitations got twisted into Sarah feeling judged is not your concern. Sometimes honesty can hurt or sting, but that doesn\u2019t make it less necessary to hear. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s just easier for her to explain away the hurt as being your fault than it is to just accept that Life sucks sometimes. \n\nYou did good, and your friend is a moron. The whole  \u201cjust give it a chance\u201d is the worst advice possible in this situation, for everyone involved except the moron friend.",
            "You are not wrong. Having a child in your life is a big lifestyle change. She sounds immature that she can\u2019t understand it\u2019s not personal.",
            "Not wrong! All cases are different based on the information . In a potential relationship scenario, this is huge in the decision process\u2026HUGE.  She knows it\u2019s going to make things much harder for her to meet someone. It\u2019s just a fact. Hence why she waited. All this stuff about waiting to see if he is a good person, that takes time. Better for her to be upfront and those that are OK with it is a much better place to start then to drop that atomic bomb later.  I know. I met my wife on a dating app and she was very clear in her profile that she had children and the person she met had to be ok with that. I was ok with that and connected. 6 years later , we are very happily married and have a kid together.  Imagine if I wasn\u2019t ok with kids, we go out and she dropped a few months later she had children.",
            "Hey, dude, I totally get where you're at. When I was 31, I was dating a great girl who had two small kids, and I had to really examine myself to decide if I could be the guy for her/them and I felt like a dick, but I broke it off.\n\nTwo years later, I met a different gal who had two small kids. She was a little older than the previous single mom I'd dated, but there was a connection there that I hadn't had with the first.\n\nTen years later, we're happily married with a third kid, and while it's never been simple or exactly easy, It's been the greatest thing to happen to me.\n\nI'm not saying that you were wrong. It was absolutely a choice that you'd have to come to terms with, one way or another.\n\nBut I will say that if you decide to give it another shot with the girl. GO ALL IN! Don't think of what might've been, focus everything on creating the best life you can, because at the end of the day, as long as there isn't something seriously dysfunctional, the circumstances aren't really what matters. It's what you do with them, and having an awesome partner can be the single most impactful, positive thing in your life.\n\nEither way, good luck!",
            "Not wrong.\n\nSomeone potentially coming into a child's life NEEDS to sit down and truly understand the impact and risks involved.\nThe good of that child depends on it.\n\nYou will have a major impact no matter what.\nIt's a huge factor when deciding on dating someone.\n\nToo many people go in without taking it seriously, and looking at themselves and the realities of the longterm.\nThey go in with a \"well cross that bridge when we get there\" \" that's the other person's responsibility\" \"It's his/her kid. We've agreed I'll be hands off\"\n\nAll of which aren't based in reality.\nIt is unfortunate, but, it has to be factored in. It has to be taken seriously. A person has to be realistic, if they aren't sure? They shouldn't move foreword. It's not just about the two of you. It's not just about how good you are together or how good a person the parent is... that kid has to come first. You have to be right for that kid. \n\nIt's not a reflection of her. \nIt's not judgement of her.\nIt's about compatibility.\nIf you aren't sure/ready or confident in the role of a responsible adult presence in a child's life, and future as a step parent... you are not right for her.\nBeing an outsider coming into a family unit is a big thing, a huge thing. There is so much more to consider.  You aren't wrong to take that seriously, logically.\nYou were/are actually being a good guy to do so.",

            "Nope.  Not at all.  I know plenty of single mothers who are tired of being manipulated into sex only to learn later the guy had no LTR interest because of the kids.  Be honest, but kind, so she knows to look elsewhere.",

You are dumping her because she has a child and you do not want that responsibility right now, which is 100% about you and your choices, not hers.  \n\nYou are NTA.",
            "No. You (I am speaking generally here) aren\u2019t going to be compatible with most people, whether because of differences in values, lifestyle, stage of life, temperament, etc. You are always justified in breaking it off with someone with whom you are not compatible. And having kids, either at all or at a particular life stage, is not something anyone should compromise on. It\u2019s not fair or reasonable to expect that of a partner, and it\u2019s wrong to intentionally bring a human into existence in a situation where both partners aren\u2019t able and excited to care for them.\n\nYou did nothing wrong by calling off a relationship where you would potentially be taking responsibility for a child without being able and excited to care for them. That woman is wrong for trying to guilt or shame you, and you do not have to waste anymore time feeling responsible for her feelings or reaction.",

Mom doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that she may be ruled out because she comes with a child.  The question then becomes what are her expectations of a relationship that becomes life long.  What does she expect of a boyfriend who may fall in live with her and what role does the child\u2019s father play in that child\u2019s life.  \n\nSeems Op carefully considered the situation that was not known by him until after he decided he was interested in the mom and honestly let her know he wasn\u2019t ready for the responsibilities her child brought to the relationship.

I met someone through friends, and similarly, he was up front that he didn't think a relationship would work.\n\nI was early 40s then, he was mid 40s. Never had kids, liked to be able to be spontaneous, travel, etc. While it sucked because I liked him, I wasn't upset or offended. He said he felt bad because he was selfish...he knew he'd resent me or the kids for plans getting canceled, etc. I told him there's nothing wrong with who he is, it just meant we weren't compatible. \n\nShe is young, and it likely is either an insecurity or it's been an issue already.

She could have controlled that, she made a choice when she was young, if she wanted you she chose wrong. She doesn\u2019t have access to you. You\u2019re out of her league.",

            "Not wrong. You are allowed your preferences and if not  dating a single mom is one of them so be it. At least you let her know early on and didnt lead her on and you're right being involved with someone who has a child is a beast of its own. If your friends and her cant understand that, then that is no fault of yours. Saying should have given her a chance... you told her why not, they shouldnt be trying to push you intoba relationship with someone with a kid if you arent ready!",
            "You're not in the wrong, here.  It is unfortunate and very regrettable that the young lady's feelings were hurt, but you can't help that. Taking on another person's child is a big responsibility, and if you're not ready for it, it's best she knows that before things moved any further along.  \n\nTBH, while it is a shame the dating scene will be difficult for her, you have a right to live through your 20's unencumbered. I was married at 24, however, we waited six more years before we felt we were ready to have a child.  It's your life to live.",

            "No, absolutely not wrong. Her so called friend should have disclosed that information up-front in the first place. Some people would have become angry over that discussion this late in the game. It's knowingly deceitful to lead someone on like that. She has no reason to feel hurt. They brought this down upon themselves, or her friend brought it down upon her.",

Your only power was about the deliverybof your feelings and it seems like you aced it, with peace and grace and well, you did the best you could.\nIt's the best for her too.

            "Sarah should have also mentioned that she had a child during the first date.",
            "You both handled it really maturely and well. This friend who blabbed needs to keep their mouth shut. Of course it will hurt at first, but it\u2019s for the best in the long wrong for you to be honest now.",

You literally told her in such a nice caring way, you were a real man in the situation and then she goes off to her friends saying she feels judged ??

            "Not only are you not wrong, you are absolutely right. Unless you are sure that's what you'd like for your life, it's unwise to involve yourself in that situation. She might handle it all well but presumably if it continued long enough you may become part of that child's life, which would be cruel if you thought you didn't want that life path. You have the right to make those decisions, she has the right to feel however she feels, but that doesn't mean your decision was wrong.",

            "You\u2019re not wrong, not even in the slightest. She\u2019s kinda AH to expect ppl to be able to accept her as a single mom. It\u2019s better to say it upfront than later and you do it in a very gentle way. Date a single mom/dad is not for everyone, she must own it. You must not comply with their gaslighting, it will turn bad if you force to have relationship with her",
            "Everyone is entitled to what the want or don\u2019t want in a relationship. I personally don\u2019t date men with kids because I also don\u2019t want whatever responsibilities that comes with dating a man with kids, especially since I currently don\u2019t have any myself. Listen, boohoo, she\u2019ll be fine. Somebody will be willing to date her, just not you.",
            "Not wrong. That\u2019s honestly a first date conversation. She knows she\u2019s wrong, so she tried to lure you in a little first and now you\u2019re getting the guilt trip treatment. Good eject.",

Personally I tend to tell my friends my immediate reaction, which is often full of anger & then I settle a bit more and accept whatever was thrown at me. Honestly it really isn\u2019t the friends place to be telling you how she felt about it, as that\u2019s disrespectful to her and you, but that\u2019s my opinion. \n\nIt seems like you have a good head on your shoulders & I completely understand where you\u2019re coming from. A hard line for me is that I won\u2019t date someone who has kids. I want my first child to also be someone else\u2019s child & I don\u2019t ever want my children\u2019s father to have the choice to pick someone else over my kids. But that\u2019s my choice! \nYou\u2019re not wrong for feeling how you do for whatever reason, especially when you seem to have explained it so respectfully.",
            "Not wrong. You were completely honest and straight up about it. You weren\u2019t nasty to her or about her son. If you felt there was pressure in that kind of responsibility then there is no reason to create that for yourself. Sure you had to hurt someone\u2019s feelings but if you were to lead the situation on and then hurt her more eventually then that would have been worse.",
            "You're really not wrong here\n\nIt sucks for her, but the fact is that having a child is a huge responsibility, massive expense, and ties you down a lot. Plus not everyone wants to be a step-parent\n\nEVERYONE has a choice on whether and when they become a parent. She made that choice at 20 years old when she decided to have her son, but you are just as entitled to make the same decision for yourself\n\nIf you do not want children at all, or do want children but are not ready to be a parent (or have any kind of parental role) at 24, or just \"aren't ready yet\", or don't want to be a step-parent, then any one of those would be a valid reason\n\nThe fact is that she can't control this now, but it was her decision - she was not just handed a child one day\n\nThere's a bit of an entitlement among some single mothers who think it shouldn't be an issue, but honestly it's kinda bullshit. It's sad that she's hurt, but she can't expect you to conform to a life decision she made 3 years ago if it isn't what you want",
            "Not wrong at all.\n\nI actually commend you for being honest in the beginning. Perhaps if she'd been more upfront neither of you would be hurt right now.",
            "You did nothing wrong. I was a single mother of five at one point. It hurt when men didn't want a relationship because I was a single mom because I see my children as amazing people and can't see why others don't. But I understand it being a huge responsibility that not everyone was able to or wanting to take on.",
            "No. You don\u2019t owe anyone anything. You could dislike her nail polish color and that would be valid enough to not be with someone. They can\u2019t make you go out with someone you don\u2019t want to be with. That\u2019s on her. She made a choice a long time ago and others can make their own decisions accordingly.",

            "I commend you for taking the time to really think about it and for being honest with her. You sound incredibly mature for your age to recognize that about yourself. Don\u2019t feel guilty and you definitely didn\u2019t make a mistake. If it\u2019s meant to be, y\u2019all will meet up again down the road of life at a later time.",

            "NTA. It's your choice.",
            "Her being disappointed is understandable, but you seem to know what you can handle and what you can\u2019t.  That\u2019s the kind of thing that needs to come out first thing on the first date\u2026she brought this on herself for getting feelings while also holding back critical info.",
            "Being a step dad can be a real challenge, it's okay to respectfully bow out.",
            "Not wrong, incredibly mature way of tending it. Others people's past mistakes shouldn't dictate your future",

            "Maybe if she had been honest from the get go, she wouldn\u2019t have become emotionally invested\u2026.. tho it is possible that she has been turned down before a relationship even starts by telling about her child up front. It\u2019s a rock and a hard place, but I don\u2019t see a huge amount of early 20s guys looking to date single mums\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
            "NTA, you\u2019re 24. Still young, and if you aren\u2019t ready for that type of responsibility, you could mess that kid.   \n\nTo me I\u2019d rather have someone be honest than to even possibly unintentionally not give or act the way the child may need you too. \n\nYou mentioned the father isn\u2019t in the picture, if she isn\u2019t putting her child everything else or asks you to be the father figure and you\u2019re not ready, that a recipe for disaster. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with you being honest if anything, doing that you are actually taking in the fact that she has a kid. You didn\u2019t mention if you wanted any,  if you wanted to be child free, or if you weren\u2019t ready but any other those feeling would be valid. \n\nShe should tell any possible partner that she had a kid. To me it would be worse going out and then finding out she has one. Kids aren\u2019t in the cards for everyone and they are a huge responsibility.  \n\nNot being upfront with that is an issue.  She is going to have to unfortunately accept that. Children are huge responsibility and no one wants to me mess up the kid.  \n\nYou both deserve to be with someone who is 100% in and can deal with a type of situation you are in. Whether it\u2019s kids, health issues, etc",
            "I would never date single mother. Biggest reason being that if I break up with her, I would lose relationship with a kid, because technically I'm nobody and her mother could just forbid to have any contact with a kid. My heart would not be able to take this without damage. \n\nBut from what I heard from my friends, they would not date single mother because some of them try to find someone who would support them and make their life easier, they are ready to settle with and decent guy, but honestly they just don't like women who had child when they were young, turns out some guys are not attracted to women who dated some pieces of shit. \n\nTo each or their own, you have valid reasons, and even if you didn't, whats the problem? It's your life do whats best for you.",
            "If you\u2019re not ready to be involved in a child\u2019s life for potentially the rest of YOUR life then it\u2019s best you knew this now and cut it off when you did.",

And I'm sure she's hurt but I'm guessing she understands. Her disappointment may be in a general way...that dating as a single mom, being young, is not easy. Most guys aren't even ready to be dad's with the kids they actually help create. Don't feel guilty. You are not wrong and you are valid. You did the right thing.",
            "Nope. I appreciate you for being honest as a mom myself thats a lot to take on",

I was in my early 20\u2019s and really hit it off with an older woman (27 and I thought she was old, lol) and I was shocked when she casually mentioned she had 2 kids. Wut??? \n\nI was totally shocked and I knew there was absolutely no way I could raise a child. No way. So I told her, and that was it. The world didn\u2019t end.",
            "It\u2019s ok to feel the way you feel. At least you\u2019re being honest with yourself and her. It\u2019s better you tell her now and not get emotionally involved with her and her son and then break it off. That would suck even more.",

            "So, first off, she\u2019s a woman. And secondly, no, you\u2019re not obligated to take on more responsibility than you want and can handle.",

            "You\u2019re not wrong in the slightest. Good for you for knowing your boundaries and upholding them. Can you imagine convincing yourself you are ready for this type of responsibility only to get deeper into a situation you aren\u2019t prepared to commit to? It would be horrible for you, her, and her child. This is the best decision you could have made at this particular time in your life\u2014for all of you.  \n\nEdited to add: she may be upset and feel poorly right now. But those are her issues and not yours. You did what you could to be gentle in your explanation and to let her know that it wasn\u2019t about her or her child, but about you not being ready. How she chooses to interpret that isn\u2019t up for you to decide. You did your best and took the responsibility for your decision to not continue the relationship. It doesn\u2019t sound like you could have done a better job",

That her son was a seriously spoilt child (and entitled too) and the dad was in prison for grooming (when we started seeing each other) were things that I wish I found out sooner though\u2026",
            "Not wrong at all, it sounds like you handled this in a very mature way. Obviously, it seems like she liked you too and hoped you would be ok with it. Dating as a single parent can be really tough, I know from experience. I always appreciated those who let me know they weren't ready for the responsibilities of kids, even if I asked nothing of them, it meant I didn't have to become emotionally attached, and my kids didn't either.",
            "She could have controlled it by not having a child. Actions have consequences, and many young people would not be okay dating single parents with young children.. It's pretty normal not to want this. You're not wrong. She is.",

            "Judged? If you told her the way you worded it on here you did nothing wrong. You're not wrong for not wanting to be with someone who has a kid. It also isn't your fault she has a kid... The mutual friend is a bit ridiculous.\nWhen you enter into a relationship with someone who has kids, you're also agreeing that you're going to care for the child as well.",
            "You are not wrong. Sarah should have disclosed she had a child from the beginning. She should aim to date men who are established and wants to take on a fatherly role.",
            "You\u2019re not wrong. You know what you want and what you don\u2019t. It would\u2019ve been wrong to start a relationship with this girl knowing you could never fully commit to it.",

Stop dating/ fucking shitty men. Everyone over 30 has known a woman who dates the bad boys, everyone tells them they are bad for them. Why do we support them when again and again when the bad boys leave them when they pregnant? Listen to your friends/family. Make your choice, deal with it.\n\nIf you want to be a single mom struggling in the dating world, keep dating bad boys.\n\nAnd yeah I know \"not all women who are single mothers\" just like 85% of them.",

            "You did nothing wrong here. If anyone was wrong, it was her. She waited to tell you she had a child. It seems as though she waited until there might be some feelings on your side, hoping those feelings would keep you dating her. \n\nYou aren't ready to have your own kids, and you don't want to become an insta-dad to someone else's. She feels hurt and judged that you broke things off because of her kid. Why would you continue to date someone who has a child, knowing you didn't even want to meet the child, let alone form a relationship with him? They are a package deal. \n\nThere are people in this world who think that if you become involved with a single parent, you somehow owe the parent a relationship. They think you should bend over backward and jump through hoops to bond with their child(ren), because \"children are the most important people in the world.\" It's a ridiculous point of view.\n\nIt was better for you to break it off now, before feelings became stronger and she started to imagine the two of you raising her kid together. You did the right thing. Very often, doing the right thing involves guilt and self-reflection. You're not an a-hole for not wanting kids in your life right now. You're someone who knows his boundaries and how to act on them. It sounds like you were polite when you broke things off, and that's all you needed to do. Please stop feeling guilty!",
            "Nope, you don't want those problems at 24...trust me...",
            "You were thoughtful and honest about your feelings (very valid feelings). That's the best we can do. You can't control people's reactions. But you must stay honest to yourself.  If you suck it up and force the couplehood, resentments grow and eventually eat away at any good between you two. I can't stand how folks see some good qualities or circumstances in a relationship. So they ignore red flags or other huge factors that are not really feasible. (I'm not saying a child/ren are always a red flag. He's probably a great kid. He's not in question. It's the situation in general is untenable for OP). \nI really respect how you handled the situation. The fact that you're taking into account your friend's criticism of your decision shows how caring and thoughtful you are. Sounds like you also handled the situation with kindness.  But don't sell yourself short to please others, especially when you really are still so young! It's so nice to read people's experiences who don't sell themselves short solely to be in a relationship. It does suck that the situation isn't right for you or that y'all couldn't connect later in life when children could be possibly more integrated into your life. However, should you decide that you never want children,  THAT'S OKAY TOO! You're still a great person, even if you don't procreate (some would say BECAUSE you don't procreate, lol)!",

            "She 100% had control over who she slept with, and had their child.  You made a mature decision, that the mutual friend is shaming you for not supporting the others poor life choices.  \nIt is not cool to an early single parent.  It is not responsible either to date one (especially if you don't have kids yet). \nTake your time to decide if and/or when kids are right for you.",

            "You\u2019re not wrong, you were very mature and upfront about your feelings. You even gave it a few days to consider all possibilities. \n\nAs a single mom, no matter how you spin it\u2019s always going to hurt being rejected, it\u2019s just one of the draw backs of being a single parent. She probably should have told you from the beginning though, at least in my opinion. I find it that it\u2019s easier to accept a rejection if I haven\u2019t gotten too close to develop feelings.",

She confided her hurt feelings to a friend, which is the appropriate way to handle a disappointment. Her friend should have minded her own business and stayed out of it, not betrayed Sarah\u2019s confidence by gossiping/confronting OP. If I were Sarah, I\u2019d be angry and embarrassed about this.",
            "Happy Cake Day!",
            "Agreed and it\u2019s tough to hear from someone\u2019s lips what you fear (in this case her fear of rejection about being a young single mother). I\u2019m sure it hurt, hopefully over time she will see it wasn\u2019t about her, but rather OP.",
            "Don\u2019t let people guilt you for this. You handled it well, the less you worry about what people think about you the better off you\u2019ll be. Good luck to you. Not wrong",
            "Agree, OP if things really went down as you said, it sounds like you made a reasonable and self-aware decision and were very respectful in the way you handled it. That\u2019s the best you can do for everyone",
            "It\u2019s understandable for this rejection to sting, but for her and her friend to paint it as you being unfair is ridiculous. Good on you for having the maturity to think ahead and not just succumb to your infatuation. Parents and their kids are a package deal for dating prospects (as well they should be). By their logic, someone who feels they MUST have a child is wrong to reject  someone who has their tubes tied or a vasectomy. It\u2019s incompatibility plain and simple.",
            "Agree, it's better than leading her on. That would have been a lot more unfair.",
            "Right\n\nI don't understand why she and other single moms get upset with potential partners that turned them down because they're single mothers. As long they're like OP, it's all good.\n\nTo put it simply: they're asking another person if they'd be willing to invest in someone they didn't help create, along with themselves.\n\nThat's a lot to ask of someone, and it's telling of her that she thought OP would just overlook the fact that she has a child.",
            "Exactly. And you don't owe her raising somebody else's kids, either.",
            "I mean, not being upfront about having a kid at first also weeds out predators, who may only be interested in her for that reason. It\u2019s a double edged sword.",
            "I do. She was hoping he was hooked first.",
            "Well, you SHOULD always be #2 but unfortunately shitty parents exist.  You still don\u2019t want to date them though, because of that reason.",
            "There also the corollary: \n\n\n> It's unfair to assume someone wants to rear someone else's child.\n\n\n\nThe other biological parent is frequently going to be an issue.",
            "Hold on here.  Sarah was just venting about how it hurts being rejected in such a way.  Which is true.\n\nSarah's friend is the real villain here, setting you two up without telling you she has a child, and then telling you about Sarah's disappointment which is A. A breach of Sarah's privacy, and B. Not your burden to carry.",
            "Ready for that? Maybe he just doesn\u2019t want that?",
            "Do people usually say \"Hello, I have a kid\"? I'm curious now",
            "Yeah I think he was respectful to not use her for sex and then dump her when she wanted more.",
            "This is something I've dealt with the past few years. Met an amazing woman with two kids. I myself have one so I thought nothing of it. I've dated before so I always kept it with a \"she's a friend\" to my son just in case things went south and we split. Treated it that way with her kids as well. I'm just friends with her and we hang out a lot.\n\nThings got serious and we got engaged. Talks between me and her on the possibility of adopting since neither of there fathers were in the picture. I grew an amazing relationship with them and her with mine. Then she decided that things weren't working out as she thought they were (which blind sided me cause I honestly thought things were going great) and ended it. \n\nLong story and lots of talking later and things are at were just friends. We've talked a lot and we both had growing up to do. I still talk to her and her kids often. I'm actually getting her son tonight so he can have a sleep over with my son.\n\nI'm glad we worked things out cause it was hard building that strong bond with the kids and having them just *poof* gone all because she decided she no longer wanted to be in a relationship",
            "I hate when people say a stepfather cannot be a father to his partners kids.  My wife's kids are my kids, with all that entails.  What is the use of them living in my house with me, our bio child, and my other 2 kids from first marriage if I cannot parent them?\n\nAnd that is a real question to everyone that reads this.  What kind of relationship do you have where this is the norm?  Even with 50/50 custody, I'll still be a father to them.  That's my job.  I can't just not help raise a child.  I'm in their life, they are in mine and our decisions affect each other.",
            "Sounds like a calculated omission to me.",
            "This",
            "The father passed away 2 years ago.",
            "Yeah, encourage him to make more single mothers. Awesome idea...",
            "What if she has your kids? You gonna stop dating her hahaha",
            "Wow \ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udffb",
            "Thanks",
            "And she says you judged her but it's ok for her to judge you for your choices? You did right to walk away now. She wasn't honest from the start.",
            "And hopefully she will understand that some people are not ready to be a parental figure. They might be ready to be like a fun, uncle or a cool aunt, but she will at some point meet people that she falls in love with, who won\u2019t ever want to have children. \n\nThat\u2019s the shitty thing about being a single parent, you will connect with people, and you will fall in love with people who don\u2019t want to be a parent to your child or any child.\n\nYou weren\u2019t wrong OP and it\u2019s was kind of you to be honest and polite about it and not ghost her or make a big deal out of it. You\u2019re definitely not an asshole.",
            "Right, I was confused by her feeling judged, when did he say a single judgey thing ? The childless ones absolutely have the right not to take on someone else\u2019s child if they feel that only one thing they want is to date their childless peers only that\u2019s absolutely wrong at all. I mean she has to have a major mental paradigm shift happen where she realizes she is single again yes, but she is not childless like before; a single mom or single dad is a completely different entity to deal with than a single person who is not a parent.  The mom needs to realize her own son is her priority now not dating because many guys will still try to smash after finding out she has a kid and then ghost her, which is so inconsiderate but when were men ever known to be considerate and caring of others first ? It\u2019s something baby girl needs to sit down for some hours and just think about what her new situation really is.  Many guys like milf fucking like it\u2019s a kink but it\u2019s not a nice thing to put a single mom thru.  Baby girl is going to have a way different life experience than before she became a mom. I have 3 kids myself, had them at 21 and 22 years old, pretty young. I did date childless women over the years and I always told them as soon as we decided to be a couple, the kids are MY KIDS. I am not looking for a stepmom. You don\u2019t need to discipline them, feed them, etc unless you feel you want to. The child is YOUR responsibility now baby girl don\u2019t blame the childless men out there for not wanting you anymore. Why would they ? Paradigm shift.  Think she is capable of being stroking and real ? Yeah she is but she\u2019s gotta embrace the suck: the fun times are OVER NOW. THE child is the one highest priority now and for 18!years.",
            "Wish more people realized that not everyone wants kids.",
            "Right? As a single mom myself, I always told people up front. Then if they\u2019re not interested, we don\u2019t waste each other\u2019s time. It doesn\u2019t make sense to hide it.",
            "As a single mother in the past, I didn\u2019t get upset about being turned down by using this one simple trick. I let it be known in first conversation. On my dating profile it was front and center. I don\u2019t want to date someone not interested in dating single mothers. It\u2019s such a simple and easy fix. No one would ever get upset because it\u2019s all right out there from the start.",
            "That may be true, but then it\u2019s not okay for her both hide important information AND be mad at him that the important information is a dealbreaker. She can\u2019t be upset at him for breaking it off & whining about feeling judged and everything else when she set it up that way.",
            "You mean, she wastes a bunch of people's time because being a single parent will affect whether or not some people want to date you. If she is worried about predators, keep the kid far away for months until you get a feeling for them.",
            "This. I dated someone for a few months before they dropped a very serious truth bomb about themselves. They had me hooked, invested, the whole thing only to tell me his secret which he KNEW I had an issue with as we had been friends on social media for a very long time. I was never ok with our relationship after that and he continually threatened suicide to keep me around. It was a brutal relationship that I was finally able to escape after a year. He literally made me sick to my stomach after his truth. Just awful.",
            "Good point, sadly! I read a post here by some mom who was hurt by her husband saying he'd save their kid rather than her if he had to choose (she quizzed him on the unlikely scenario), and somehow her feelings were hurt by this. Some folks are monsters.",
            "Well here she did say he\u2019s not in the picture (bio dad) but you never know somewhere down the line, could be drama.",
            "Any dates I've had with single mothers I've either already known because of mutual friends or it's been disclosed no later than the end of the first date.",
            "They went on a few dates. She intentionally didn't tell him she had a kid.",
            "Congratulations on getting with a single mother who respects you enough to let you parent her children.",
            "Let me ask you this, why do you think she waited to tell you about her child after you developed a connection? Doesn\u2019t seem honest, does it.",
            "Hell, she might\u2019ve been venting in an honest and vulnerable way to her friend and the friend is the problem. \n\nShe could\u2019ve easily said something about feeling \u201cjudged\u201d in a broader sense rather than, \u201cOP judged me unfairly because I\u2019m a mom, that asshole!\u201d \n\nShe\u2019s a young single mother, she probably knows what struggles she\u2019s going to deal with. Maybe didn\u2019t want her friend to butt in like this at all.",
            "100% nailed it and I agree with the wasnt honest from the start, and then she calls him \"judgemental\" when she judged him for politely declining dating her because he wasnt ready for that responsibility?!  ***YIKES***",
            "Nailed it.",
            "How was she not honest? Just because she didn't blurt out she has a kid? Complete disclosure to a stranger isn't necessary. She gave it some time to get to know him. She probably wanted to be reasonably sure he wasn't a creeper before she introduced him to her son.",
            "She was honest at the appropriate time.",
            "\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffc Same boat.",
            "Or maybe she was just venting to a friend about breaking up with someone she liked? Holy hell.",
            "Oh I get your point of view, I was just adding a bit of perspective on why some people might choose to hold back info for a couple dates etc. Not saying they are right or wrong.",
            "I read more comments. Apparently he's dead.",
            "Exactly!!! The mutual friend left out a pretty important detail when setting this up I reckon!!",
            "Mmm I think that is the crux of it honestly.  Respect and trust.  Hell, I actively dislike her ex.  But I do respect the effort he puts in when he has them, and he respects mine.  My wife understood from the start that she is a mother and I am a father.  Our kids come first, and it's better with 2 parents than one.  Or in our case, 4 parents lol.  I have 7 kids living in my house but only 5 are related to me or my wife.  If a child needed a home, mine is open.  At times I've had eleven living with us.  I have single person cabins built along my property just for that reason.  My oldest is 24 and my youngest is 2 months.  I honestly did not expect to remarry.  I just found the one.",
            "No, but I don't blame her. I was the first she dated after her boyfriend passed, and it was only 2 weeks after we went out, not like it's been months.",
            "That is a very valid point, the friend that introduced them didn't mention her child, maybe by request, we will never know. Some people can take on a family, some can't, neither view is wrong.",
            "The mutual friend violated her confidence. I can\u2019t imagine she wanted what she vented to get back to him.",
            "It\u2019s weird that she would think that dating in itself is not a judgment filled process. Lol It\u2019s basically all judgment! \n\nI have a child and if I get divorced and start dating I wouldn\u2019t chose to date someone with children. Lol I would just be a cat lady and enjoy my peaceful life. I don\u2019t blame anyone for not wanting to date someone with kids. It\u2019s a huge deal.",
            "She shouldn't be introducing him to her son for quite some time *after* him knowing she was a single mother.  And his decision wasn't a moral judgement. There are a *lot* of logistics when dating a single parent.",
            "Was she honest about her set up? no. Some people are cool with dating a family, some are not. He made the choice that suited him.",
            "Disclosure of a major dependent like a child us dishonesty by omission. Parents know that can change perception and datability. She was hoping to suck him in first.",
            "Oh come on. She was obviously hiding it the first few dates. I wouldn't be able to make it through even one date without mentioning my kids. They're part of who I am. She purposely did not say a word.",
            "She didn\u2019t have to introduce him at the time or any time soon. But if you go on a date and you don\u2019t tell them and then you have a great time and go on more dates now you are invested and so is he and then bam you throw that out there and except him to what? Just be ok? The whole foundation of the relationship was a lie. I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s something you say up front.",
            "That\u2019s also a possibility. Why the holy hell?",
            "I don\u2019t read any comments. Ever.",
            "To clarify a little more, I just mean the \u201cafter the fact\u201d comments specifically. \n\nThe mutual friend might be on some mother bear behavior and the woman is completely understanding albeit sad, which is natural.",
            "That\u2019s a fair point.",
            "Exactly this! Dating is all judgement. Is this person right for the long term? Their family? Habits? Religion? Political views? Etc\u2026 it isn\u2019t judgement as in black/white, right/wrong. It\u2019s judging if that person is compatible with you.",
            "Exactly!!!",
            "Not just logistics. Many people on Reddit have said they wouldn't want to date a single parent bc of the heartbreak of loving and losing contact with the kid u spend so much time with, if the relationship with the parent does not work out. This is a very important thing to consider too.",
            "And a lot of stuff is just off the table. A lot of couples in their early 20s spend a few years traveling and other leisurely activities. Most of that is off the table with a toddler, both practically and financially. It just doesn't match OP's life goals right now. Maybe she should look for someone pushing 30.",
            "You are forgetting this is Reddit and you mustn\u2019t disagree with the worldly, I live in my moms basement opinion of the fe/males neckbeards.",
            "I had no issue not mentioning my kids to some dates. They're a part of who I am. The biggest part, even after they moved out. Sometimes it just didn't come up organically and I wouldn't talk to somebody about kids that weren't interested. In any situation.",
            "Oh come on, yourself. There are some men who get with single mothers  to \"get with\" their kids. They have to hold some information back for a bit until they get to know the person better. Dating is how you get to know someone.",
            "Congrats you\u2019re putting your kids in danger",
            "I\u2019m actually astonished this isn\u2019t understood by everyone.",
            "Totally. I was dumped by someone because - and I quote \u201cfor me it\u2019s about kids.\u201d I didn\u2019t have kids and he was looking to date someone with children. Specifically mixed race children - which I thought was weird (please don\u2019t misunderstand me, I do not have a problem mixed raced kids - it just seemed a weirdly specific thing to be actively looking for in a relationship sense.) he dumped and ghosted me for a woman who did have mixed race kids.",
            "This is exactly why she did the right thing by not saying anything earlier.",
            "THIS! Yes, it\u2019s a persons right to share and be vulnerable on their own terms.",
            "It seems weirdly specific to me as well and I am a mixed raced person."

        "content": "I (34F) had a birthday dinner last night that my partner (33M) and I covered the cost of the food for all guests, all they needed to pay for was any drinks they wanted. \n\n3 of the guests got me a joint gift of sourdough bread and a jar of honey from some artistrian bread cafe. \n\nI was polite and thanked them for the gift and we carried on with a nice evening but fuck I am pissed off about such a shit gift! Who the fuck gifts a loaf of fucken bread to someone for their birthday?! \n\nThe thing is I don't care for bread, have never mentioned bread before in conversation or made the stuff. I buy my fucken bread from the shop and put it in the freezer and use it when I feel like it (which isn't often). \n\nThey were even talking about it with other guests saying, when you don't know what to get someone get them consumables- like it was the best gift idea ever... It is fucken bread! \n\nAIW for being annoyed, miffed and just pissed off these people got me a loaf of fucken bread that cost no more than $20 as a gift between 3 of them when my partner and I shelled out $60 to feed all 3 of them last night to celebrate my birthday?\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI am Australian \n\nThe \"gift expectation\":\nPpl seem to think I was expecting gifts from everyone. That is not true, there was several who didn't get me a gift and I don't care. As I have said numerous times I would have preferred nothing. I am upset because this gift is so left field of me it has me questioning myself and their motives. \n\nIf anyone is curious out of the 6 people who came I got 2 gifts; the bread and a gift voucher from someone else. \n\nThe 3 people:\nThe three people are fine financially. Two are a retired couple and one is a single woman. And yes they were told on the invitation that food was covered just buy your own drinks.\n\nWhy I don't like the gift:\nI don't appreciate bread at all it is just a good item I will eat if it is there, but I don't care for it or its fancy versions. I also don't like honey that much that I would use it at home. I will have it when I go out and that is it. The honey was local raw honey. \n\nThe place we are at being \"cheap\":\nIt was an all you can eat Mongolian BBQ restaurant, it is \"cheap\" because all you have to choose from is frozen meat brisket, sliced vegetables and 6 sauces. It wasn't buffet food with oodles of options. It is just a meat/veg option to be bbq by the staff for you. We choose this food options because people can have as much or as little and what they wanted and leave feeling satisfied.\n\nThe tldr truma around my birthday:\nNarc parent shit birthdays my whole life, these ppl know birthdays are an interesting time for me.\n\nWhy we paid for people's meals:\nMy partner and I recently moved to the city and before we moved I lived in a country town that is 35 minutes from the city. And all but 1 of the guests we invited live in the country town, they were driving down to see me I wanted to make it worth their while. Not that it matters but the 1 person who lives in the city we picked them up and dropped them off home. \n\nEdit 2:\n\nI was given the bread because one of the 3 people have it all the time at a cafe with eggs on it. They have never brought it themselves. They did ask if I tired the honey and I said honestly honey isn't my thing and they just told me to put it in cakes or tea (I never drink tea). ",

            "I was always brought up with the attitude of \u2018don\u2019t expect a gift, even if you decide to spend any amount of money on someone, don\u2019t expect anything in return. If they happen to get you something, fantastic it\u2019s a bonus you didn\u2019t expect to get\u2019  perhaps maybe you need to focus a little less on what presents/gifts they give you and more on how they are as a friend in general? \n\nAlso $60 is pretty freaking cheap to spend on 3 people for dinner in aus, be thankful you don\u2019t live in Sydney cause that would of cost you like x5 more \ud83d\ude06",
            "Since you invited them to dinner, maybe they were just trying to bring something that contributed to the meal? I stopped expecting presents a long time ago as an adult, people showing up to the party is the gift.",
            "I would love to have the recipe for fucken bread.",
            "My husband literally this weekend bought real sourdough bread (as opposed to what is often called sourdough but doesnt actually use the specific starter unique to sourdough - thanks a lot fodmop diet!!) and it was from a very nice bakery in a small bougie town. It cost $30 and, while I didnt buy it because I couldnt afford the extra, it was being offered with a local farm artisan flavored honey which was $25. So, if it was a $55 gift in my nearby small but fancy town, it could be even higher than that in a bigger city, I dont know where you're located.\n\nAll to say I would have been genuinely thrilled to save myself $60 and have tea with bread and honey but that's just me I guess.\n\nLucky for us Trader Joes has the real thing for much cheaper than that bakery but it worked in a pinch.",
            "37M. I would love a fresh sourdough loaf.",
            "You're wrong. A fancy artisanal loaf and honey is a perfectly acceptable gift for an adult. It's not like it's supermarket white loaf. If I have to gift my adult friends, most of them live in apartments and won't appreciate useless clutter. When they do need something, like a new pan or some other material thing, it's usually either too expensive to give an acquaintance or the kind of thing people prefer to buy themselves (eg clothing). \n\nFood won't take up space for long and bread is very neutral unless you're a celiac. It sounds like you just aren't as close as you imagined to these people.",
            "So\u2026 are you inviting people for their company or for their gift potential?",
            "I\u2019m sorry, but if you still expect some extravagant gift for your birthday at the age of 34, I think you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m in my 30\u2019s and a nice evening and better company suffices for me.",
            "You are wrong. \n\nAnd, you will spend your life in a constant state of disappointment if you put expectations on others based on your perception of what is appropriate in return for your \"generosity\" towards them. Life and friendships should not ever be transactional or quid pro quo.",
            "I hate people that bitch about gifts. Like oh no someone gave me something for free. But it\u2019s not what I wanted so I\u2019m pissed.",
            "You sound like an entitled prick. \nThat's a great adult gift. And how many adults get gifts on their birthday in the first place?",
            "Info: why are you paying for their meals when it's your birthday?",
            "Never buy something for someone and expect anything back. A sourdough bread and honey is maybe all they could afford or grab, you should just be happy that you got to spend time with people you like, and be grateful that you were able to take them all out to dinner",
            "Yep, you are wrong here.\n\nWe are entitled to literally no gift. That\u2019s what makes it a gift and not a payment. \n\nWhen someone gets me something, I\u2019m just happy they thought of me at all. \n\nDo your friends care about you? Are they good friends? \n\nIf yes, then, that\u2019s the real gift. \n\nBe grateful you have people like that in your life, and just view the bread is a wierd souvenir of that. \n\nHell, I have it varnished and hang it  on the wall.",
            "YTA- bread is good and she probably did it out of the kindness of her heart",
            "Yes, you are wrong. Invite people because you want to spend time with them, not because you hope they will bring you a gift that costs more than hosting them. Artisanal foods are perfectly lovely gifts for adults, and throwing yourself a birthday party in your thirties because you want to see the gifts rolling in is just really cringey.",
            "Who expects presents at 34? WOW!! So you spent $60 to feed 3 people, do you want a cookie?yes, your wrong.",
            "I mean if the loaf of bread cost $20 it must be banger sourdough, I'd be thrilled with that but i love bread.

            "Have you tried the bread yet? A great loaf of bread can be a transcendent and luxurious experience. I actually tend to agree with your friends that for people 30 and up, consumables are usually the way to go.\n\nAs a man in my 30's if I want a product like a tool or clothes or any other thing that I will be using on a consistent basis for a number of years, I will have already researched exactly what I want and bought it. If I haven't done that already, it's probably more costly than would be appropriate to expect from a fellow non wealthy person. I'm not going to add it to a gift wish list. Most older adults have non luxury items locked down already.\n\nGifts like quality consumables are often a good idea (obviously in this case they failed to properly tailor their choice to your interests unfortunately) because while I will spend decent money on a good tool or a pair of headphones, I probably won't regularly shell out 15 dollars for a loaf of bread or 50 dollars for a nice bottle of wine. That can allow someone to give a meaningful  but not super expensive gift that can be appreciated even if the person gifted is wealthier.\n\nedit. - I forgot to address that three people pooled together for that gift. That is a very bad look unless they are all extremely poor. I can't see that gift costing more than 30 dollars at the absolute most. To me 50.00 USD is a pretty standard friend level gift tier. I wouldn't start pooling with other people until the 80 to 90 dollar threshold. It's very bizarre that they went joint on a gift like that.\n\nedit 2. - Was it M\u0101nuka Honey? I forgot that there are some premium honey varietals that are much more expensive.",

It's not that your wrong to want to feel valued, it's just that by attaching so much importance to your birthday, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Most people are pretty low-key about birthdays. You may just need to reconcile your childhood and not let the gifts have too much meaning today. \n\nIf I had a friend who went what I would consider overboard for my birthday, I'm not sure I would feel that I had to reciprocate in kind. I might not get the message.",

Probably not mad, but just confused or something.  \n\nJapan has a very different culture when it comes to gifts, and they love to get each other food stuff as gifts.  At first I thought it was odd and didn't really enjoy it.  After a few years, I started really appreciating it and love it.  It gives me a chance to try new and fancy foods that I would not normally buy for myself or my family.  Btw, fancy can mean expensive but typically does not.  Food culture is huge out here and a lot of times it's about having fun picking out new and enjoyable things that you can share with friends and family.  \n\n\nWith that said, 10 years ago I probably would have been disappointed with bread and honey as a gift.

So to each their own. \n\nThe dumb part was that they split the gift between three people\u2014 that\u2019s cheap as fuck.

You aren\u2019t a child. \n\nAnd don\u2019t do \u201cnice\u201d things like pay for dinner if you expect something in return. That makes it not nice at all.",

Don\u2019t host a party celebrating yourself and treat people if you cannot afford to do so without calculating how much their gift to you is worth. $20/person for dinner is also the cost of a fast food meal around here so given that\u2019s what you can afford, I\u2019m going to assume your friends also cannot afford a lot. So a $20 loaf of bread and a jar of honey seems pretty on par. If $20/head means a lot to you then just invite people and let them know what the cost of dinner is so they can spend their money that way instead of buying you bread that you\u2019re going to complain about later.",

Maybe they\u2019re short on cash and don\u2019t know what you\u2019d like, but certainly they should have reached out and felt comfortable doing so. \n\nSo you\u2019re not wrong - you did the polite thing.

            "Yea, I think it\u2019s actually quite a nice \u2018gesture\u2019 then, rather than a gift. For an adult, you don\u2019t really expect presents. It\u2019s nice if someone rocks up with a bottle of wine or something, but it\u2019s never expected. I get it you\u2019d rather have had nothing, but that implies you were expecting SOMETHING which turned out to be a thing you thought was unworthy of \u2018gift\u2019 status so you\u2019d RATHER have had nothing than consider it a gift. \n\nI think if someone bought me a fancy bread and some honey I\u2019d be delighted. I\u2019d go and get some nice charcuterie to go with it and enjoy it with some wine on a different evening. \n\nAdult \u2018gifts\u2019 aren\u2019t supposed to be extravagant, especially if they\u2019re not from a SO. It\u2019s just a simple gesture to say \u2018here!

Remember your pocketbook isn\u2019t their pocketbook. I think you are wrong to be mad tbh. You don\u2019t give gifts because you expect it in return. The gift was pretty careless but honestly they all may be getting tired of this expensive exchange for everyone\u2019s birthday.",
            "Well I can't believe you're so upset over bread. I actually really love bread so I would consider that a really good gift.

I guess I\u2019ll get kicked off to Downvote Hell for this, but really, be grateful you have friends, don\u2019t be a sour-d\u2019oh. it\u2019s instilled in my family - from grandparents to us \u2018\u2019middle agers\u201d to the grandkids, that it\u2019s so great  to receive a gift, something bought for you out of affection, even love - that you\u2019re happy and express true thanks to receive whatever, a pot of jam, a paperback novel - just as you would had you been gifted say, a laptop. I know that sounds ridiculous, but i really do feel that way. A long time ago, I bought my then 10 year old daughter her first computer. While we were setting it up, she and her brother climbed into the enormous box it had come in, and began pretending playacting they were on a sinking ship, woah matey! When I came out to say her computer was up and running, she dashed to her room, thanking me for all her gifts, the computer, the printer, the big cardboard box \u2026",

            "You are not wrong BUT this is brilliant. I would give them bread gift baskets for the rest of their lives. And not ones that make sens! Like buy a basket, open a bag of normal sliced bread and place the slices like decorations on all angles( think rose but make it odd add hights and layers, extra points if you put a jar of non brand honey smack in the middle). Then plastic wraping and a bow. Rinse and repeat forever... Get famous for your odd bread baskets. if someone asks reply lovingly with a sigh \"they just all love bread, its a carb thing\".",
            "You are absolutely wrong. This is a wonderful gift. I'd be overjoyed if my friends got me anything, tbh. We're adults with expenses. Gifts tend to be few and far between these days, which is fine, because we all want each other's company. But artisanal bread is really thoughtful.",
            "I understand OP, it hurts when you get a gift that seems to carry the message that the giver just doesn\u2019t see you or understand you enough to give you something that you would really love and appreciate. I remember when my mom\u2019s boss gave her a bottle of expensive champagne for a work anniversary at a place where she had worked for decades. She didn\u2019t drink alcohol. She would much rather have had a gift that was of value to her, but more so she was hurt that this boss didn\u2019t know her well enough to notice that she doesn\u2019t drink alcohol or bother to ask someone what she might have liked. \n\nMy advice here is to try to soothe your inner child by gently telling yourself that your friends meant well and look for other evidence that they love and care about you. Help that inner child understand that they aren\u2019t really rejecting you here, they just made a mistake. Then get yourself something nice that you wish someone would have gotten for you. Maybe talk it over with a friend or loved one to process it. \n\nHappy Birthday OP! I hope you have a wonderful year.",

            "Pretty lame gift for sure. Politely and tactfully say at an opportune time that gift giving should come to an end. NTA but not by much",
            "Given the context here, it was rude and a lack of thought. This is the type of thing my friend's mom gets for her every holiday\u2014 random, last minute items snatched from a convenient store just to claim she gave something. And that stings more than no gift at all. Especially as a joint gift from three people, because a bread and some fancy honey isn't really worth much.\n\n\nIf you gift people food or baking, it's best in conjunction with something else, as a small gesture when you're short on funds but want to do something, or for small occasions. The appropriate gesture here would have been to pay for your meal (splitting the cost between them if they needed to). And if they were short on money but gift exchanges are customary within your friend group, they could have let you know ahead of time. But surely all three of them weren't going through money issues all at once...\n\n\nSo instead of being thoughtful, their gift came off as cheap and thoughtless, especially since they seemed to gloat about it at the table with the other guests. It's clear they didn't know what you wanted and didn't care to ask, and were fine with letting others know that.\n\n\nPersonally, I would bring this up to them. If you don't, they'll think you *enjoyed* that gift and will be incentivized to repeat it in the future. Thank them for the gesture and for coming to celebrate with you, but tell them their gift is somewhat disappointing, because it felt like they didn't care to give you something you liked. You felt a bit forgotten, especially because you have history of being overlooked on your birthday by family. If you've given each of them nice gifts in the past, bring that up. Let them know if it was a concern with cost, whatever they give you doesn't have to be impressive\u2014 it just has to mean something.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd that's the problem with what they gave you. It's not the items itself, it's that their gift didn't mean anything. They were just filler, placeholder gift items, the bare minimum, letting you know that you aren't worth being thought of. And whether they meant to say that or not, it hurts.",

That said, I am confused in that you said you weren\u2019t expecting gifts or that it would have been better if they didn\u2019t bring anything. If that is the case, why would you get mad about them doing something beyond that expectation? Was it artisan bread and honey, or just a regular grocery chain store brand loaf?",

I appreciate that anyone would get me anything at all, too. But is the bar that low, especially when the birthday girl is buying YOU dinner? Match that energy, ffs! \n\nOne of my close friends is notoriously hard to buy for, for any occasion. She even went through a phase where she thought giving gift cards was \"lazy\" and showed you didn't know the person that well, so I got her a funny card with money/a lotto ticket and some chocolate or candy or whatever treat she liked at the time. \n\nAnd sure, there's been times I haven't had the time or money to get someone a proper gift (or any gift at all), but I've said as much and apologised and made it up to them in other ways. It'd make sense if OP had mentioned at any point that they like sourdough or honey or ate that kind of food, but from the sound of OP's comments, it seemed very last-minute and odd. Hell, I'd be terrified to give someone that random of a gift without a gift card or something else a little more mainstream. \n\nAnd OP, if you've gotta pay money to encourage people to even TRY to be your friend, they're not your friend. Know your worth.\n\n/rant.",

            "Not wrong. Sounds to me like they didn't know what to get you, so they got you something they wanted. It's pretty common with gift giving when they want it to truly be a surprise (some people don't like buying from a list because that ruins the surprise). I know the saying is \"it's the thought that counts,\" but this doesn't sound like any real thought was put into it.\n\nWhen my 10 year old gives me something that is clearly just something he liked and thus thought I would like, I see the thoughtfulness in it. Unless your \"friends\" are around that age, this seems very unthoughtful.",

The \u201cif u dont know what to get someone get them consumables\u201d rlly only applies to foodstuffs that person has indicated they liked before or that most people would like, which i dont think sourdough fits into that category.

And the real deal, especially the honey can be expensive!\n\nAnything artisanal is an appropriate gift imo. It's a pity OP doesn't eat bread. But still...\n\nLike: I hate licorice. If you gift me Swedish licorice because I'm a Scandinavia fan, I'll thank you and then serve it when I have guests who love that stuff, or gift it on.

If I were going to an adult\u2019s birthday party and didn\u2019t have a gift I might stop by a bakery for some nice bread and honey. Those are on the same level as bringing a plant. I would be pleased to receive that.\n\nYou say every birthday you have is shit. Do you think it\u2019s possible you set yourself up every year for a birthday where you will find something to be disappointed by? Sometimes as adults, we subconsciously recreate scenarios from our childhoods in an attempt to change the outcome, but unintentionally recreate the pattern and ultimately end up feeling the same way.",
            "That makes more sense.\u00a0 I've never made a big deal about birthdays but my SO does for himself and his kids. So my first birthday after we moved in together,\u00a0 he didn't do/Plan anything,\u00a0 and I was super miffed. Because it felt like it was his 'Thing' and yet I didn't matter enough for it. So, yes. I can definitely understand what you're saying.\u00a0\n\n\nI suggest taking care of yourself on your birthday. Plan a trip. Book a spa day. Plan an activity that you know you'll love. And then just go do that. Exclude others, or invite them to join if they wish but they pay their own way.\u00a0 That way you don't have to worry about other people ruining your day.\n\n\nI turn 40 this year,\u00a0 and I'm thinking of booking a vacation. Just so I can have a good time, with my plans, and know it'll be what I enjoy.",

            "Honestly I have always had shit birthdays myself, up to and including my breaking point which was my 30th birthday for which I was told that my birthday present was that I was expected to help my brother in law (at the time; I\u2019m divorced and you\u2019ll soon see a contributing factor to that life decision) move his family of 4 out of a 3 bedroom house because they were being evicted. In late July in 100 degree weather.\n\nI told everybody to FUCK RIGHT OFF, including his sister my then-wife. (I should probably note that everybody else\u2019s birthday in that family was treated like a High Holy Day complete with a feast and absolutely nothing else was allowed to get in the way of the festivities.)\n\n(I should also note this was not the first time I was conscripted to help this particular fuck-up move out of an apartment or a rental house that he was being summarily evicted from, always on last minute Red Alert notice.)\n\nI told my now-ex wife to go be with her fucked up family & spent the day alone watching the first few seasons of Futurama on DVD. Ever since then I have an annual tradition of spending my god damn birthdays with somebody I can respect, aka ME AND ME ALONE \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd yes, I still watch Futurama from S1-4 on the day to commemorate the occasion lol",
            "There is something about birthdays that puts most adults in a funk, even without the traumatic childhood. Your friends didn\u2019t make much effort for your gift, and I am sure that hurts a lot. It sounds like you have a good partner though, so perhaps you could organise a fun birthday just with him next year. I would also recommend organising for yourself a very childish birthday at least once, so you can scratch that itch. Think of it as a costume party if it helps. It sounds silly, but it has worked for me (recreating a childhood experience that went wrong in the way I would have liked it to be).",

You\u2019re still expecting gifts from your friend group? \n\nMy friend group hasn\u2019t exchanged gifts in years (some never), we\u2019re all too busy caring for kids/families. A simple text or FB message is all we send each other anymore, and that\u2019s perfectly acceptable. \n\nThey got you a relatively inexpensive gift, and even explained their rationale. Rather than get you some physical crap that takes up room, they got you a consumable you could try. \n\nLet\u2019s be real, you were pissed off because you were expecting a more expensive gift. You CHOSE to do a birthday dinner and cover most of the cost, they did you a service by showing up, and brought you a small gift. They didn\u2019t owe you anything.",

            "A gift card is a marketing trick to make you spend in that particular shop just because they made a cute card. Basically it says \u201cI can\u2019t be assed to find out what you really want but I don\u2019t trust you to spend responsibly so I will limit you to this one shop\u201d. Just give them the universally accepted gift card that has no time limit called \u201ccash\u201d.",

I couldn\u2019t bear it if I didn\u2019t have a gift for someone on a gift giving occasion, even with no notice. It may not be the perfect gift for them, but it would be something! It has saved me on at least a couple of occasions (niece\u2019s new boyfriend at Xmas dinner, husband telling me a dinner invitation was actually for the person\u2019s birthday an hour before we were due to leave etc).",

            "Dear OP, you have value and are not worthless.  No one knows why your friends brought you that token gift, especially since you paid for the meal.  I agree that the gift seemed to be a thoughtless gift. Next year for your birthday, perhaps you should have a private, intimate birthday date with your SO and then a separate, casual party with your friends. If your friends are not meeting your emotional needs on your birthday, they might not be invested enough to be your closest friends.  Perhaps you could try to find friends who understand the depth of friendship you would like.  You could still be involved with these friends but consider them as acquaintances since they don't invest as much emotionally into the friendship as you do.  Remember, you have value as you are.  It seems to me that your needs were not met as a child and you might have issues with that now.  I was abused as a child so I know how it feels to be an adult coming from such a background.  Neither your friends nor anyone else give you value.  You have always had value since you were born, unfortunately, because your value was abused or neglected you feel you don't have any but all of us do.  Start saying positive affirmations to yourself, I'm sure you have a natural talent for something. Maybe music, crochet, or whatever it is that you love.  Start doing whatever it is and feel good about yourself because no one can make your self-esteem grow but yourself.  You are loved and a valuable person.  Belated Happy Birthday, I sincerely hope that next year's birthday will meet your expectations.  \u2728\ufe0f\ud83d\udc96\u2728\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\u2728\ufe0f",

By not valuing the people you love by not bothering to get them a gift, is fine if that\u2019s the way you want to live.\n\nGifts should also be actually thoughtful. Thoughtful does not equal thinking. They may have thought of her in theory but where is the actual thought? It had nothing to with her likes and they know her well. That isn\u2019t thoughtful at all. It\u2019s selfish. In that case, she is right, it would have been better if they didn\u2019t bother. They are her food and enjoyed her hosting HER birthday and they throw some bread at her. Not thoughtful at all.\n\nAs for your other assumptions about me? Not interested.",

Not everyone is cut out to be a nurse/caregiver and it is not a one person job as you know since your mom can't do it without your help.",
            "Not wrong. Any type of full time care role is draining, both emotionally and physically. Honestly. not all that many people are cut out for it even if they want to do it.\n\nYou've already sacrificed your entire childhood to helping to care for your sister, and she's not your responsibility, she's your mum's. You're not even an adult yet and your mother is already signing away the rest of your life to caring for your sister. Absolutely no thought to you wanting to go to college, get a job, join the military, get married, have kids of your own. Whatever your goals in life are. \n\nI think there's a reason she talked to you about this now, you're 17. I don't think this is a 'when I can't do it anymore' thing, I think it's a 'when you're 18 and finished high school' thing. She's expecting you to fully take over as soon as you finish high school and are legally an adult.\n\nDo some research into help available for people with disabled family members that need this type of care. There will be charities and facilities that can help and/or house your sister. You're not the only option, you're just the only family member that's an option, and your mum has literally been training you for this most of your life. \n\nAlso, seek legal advice, find out if there's a way to prevent responsibility for your sister being passed on to you. I would have thought you couldn't just assign someone as full time carer/legal guardian without the agreement of that person, but I'm not actually sure if that's the case. If you need to agree to taking full responsibility for your sister, simply say no. But if your permission isn't needed, you need to know now, so you can either find a way to make sure it never passes to you or you have a care facility ready to take in your sister as a permanent resident. If you can't get out of being made legally responsible, your mum can't complain about you putting your sister in a facility the second it's all legal, she'll no longer have a say in her daughter's life and care, and you've already made clear you won't be a full time carer.\n\nApply for colleges if you want higher education, as far away from home as you can get. Or look into jobs/apprenticeships/the military, preferably also far away from home. Get all your documents and other important items together, birth certificate and such, so you have it all hands if you need to leave fast. Start scaling back how much care you provide for your sister and tell your mum that you're moving out as soon as you graduate high school and will no longer be providing any care for your sister at that point. Make it very clear that, as soon as high school is over, your mum is sole carer for her daughter. If you don't already have one, get a job, something you can earn some money from and save every penny for when you move out. Also, join some groups in your area, something to keep you busy and out of the house even when you're not working or at school. \n\nYour mum needs to get out of fantasy land and start making realistic plans for her daughter's future care, plans that don't include you.",

            "NTA. your mom is most likely very well aware of how expensive in and out of home care is going to be. And, whether she likes it or not, is most likely going to have to face that reality of being unable to care for her much longer soon depending on how disabled your little sister is. Some kids with mental disabilities only get stronger as they age, regardless of any current physical disabilities. \n\nMy suggestion? Move out of state for college. Make it difficult for your mom to just drive in and drop her off with you by being as far as possible.  My guess is she is probably expecting you to take over almost entirely once you're 18, 21, or 25 and be able to assign Medical Power of attorney to you.\n\n\nSadly, there may come a time when you'll be forced to deal with your mom's clear lack of planning... life really rarely ever goes the way we expect. My mom for example? Has a lifelong heart defect and her heart has finally given up.  Her new pace maker will give her another 5 years at most. She's only 57 now. Or my MIL? Has had kidney cancer once already and just got lit up again in her most recent scan. She has no plans to fight it this time if it's back. She's 53. \n\nI want you to make plans and consider all your avenues for when your mom isn't able to help care for your sister. Not for you to do it yourself and give up your life for her. I mean, consider routes like adult care facilities, around your college or where you'll settle down. . There's some really kind facilities that will allow you to keep your baby sister in your life and permit not only visits but day trips and even over night stays so you can visit her often or take her out on outings. You still love your sister,  and I'm sure will want her to still be in your life. Just not with you as the active, and frankly draining, role of permanent carer. \n\n\nYour mom is going to give her care over to you one day,  unfortunately whether you like it or not. If she does it before she passes, she can't argue about what being her legal guardian means once she is your responsibility. If she's stupid enough to not put her in a care home herself when the time comes. Research all possible avenues of approach and be fully prepared for your mom's unwillingness to plan for the future. \n\nGood luck. Don't back down. You'll be great.  You're a good kid and will make a great adult soon.",
            "This will probably come off cold, but I don\u2019t mean it to be. It\u2019s not bad that your mom is thinking and planning for this (I would do the same), but assuming your sister was born with her disabilities and your mom isn\u2019t in her late 50\u2019s to 60\u2019s at the moment, your mom is statistically going to outlive her disabled daughter. \n\nThe mental disabilities lessen her life at minimum 7-10 or so years, depending on the study. Physical disabilities start at about 5 years less and increase from there depending on severity of the physical issues. \n\nYou\u2019re not wrong, but a better approach might be to tell your mom you\u2019ll think about it and drop the subject. \n\nAfter all, you\u2019re too young to know yet what you\u2019ll want to do in 20-30 years. And unfortunately, this might not even be an issue as her life isn\u2019t likely to be especially long. I\u2019ve been a nurse a long time, and seeing someone with this level of mental disability in their late 40\u2019s to 50\u2019s is pretty uncommon. \n\nI hope your sister and you have good lives, I don\u2019t wish her a short life, I\u2019m just reporting facts. Be a good son and brother right now, but don\u2019t stress out about things that might not happen. Your mom can plan all she wants, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll have to become your sister\u2019s caregiver. No point in arguing about it right now, let mom plan.

He could look after himself but needed support with groceries cooking and day to day life. Not very much, but a lot of prompting. He would also have intense emotional outbursts if something didn\u2019t go his way and would be inappropriate towards females. He had a twin in another facility that was severely mentally disabled. Their older sister had been their main carer until she moved them both to their respective facilities. His twin sister couldn\u2019t live at the same facility as her brother and vice versa due to both needing different levels of care. He was very resentful of his older sister who at that point was in her 70\u2019s. \n\nThe older sister told the Manager of the facility when she once came to visit and her brother tried to attack her. \n\n (never did that to any member of staff. We were actually truly shocked. After that incident the manager did everything she could to have him moved at a different facility because she needed to keep the staff safe. We weren\u2019t made aware that he had violent outbursts and that facility wasn\u2019t equipped of dealing with that) \n\nOlder sister said that her biggest mistake was not putting them in a facility the moment her parents passed or weren\u2019t able to care for the twins. She said with the most heartbreaking voice that she had wasted her life and health looking out for the twins. She wanted kids but never had as she was afraid what the twins especially the sister might do to them. And her husband had to give her an ultimatum to finally put them in a facility equipped to handle their care. \n\nAfter that incident, she contacted the social services and relinquished her powers of attorney and went on travelling.\nSomething she could never do until in her 70\u2019s. \n\nOp, you not taking this responsibility is the right thing to do. I have seen what this lady\u2019s suffering and another one with a sister at the same facility. And they had to put their lives on hold for their siblings and regretted it. Paid with their own health and happiness. Go live your life and build your own happiness. If your mother doesn\u2019t understand that then that\u2019s on her. She needs to understand that while she has a duty of care for your sibling, she has the same duty of care for you. And expecting you to sacrifice your life and future for your sibling is just plain stupid and selfish of her. You are not obligated to sacrifice everything for your sibling and you deserve to live for yourself and be happy.",

OP stated he is 17yrs old and has already given up a good chunk of his life helping care for his sister. You say he\u2019s supposed to go out and spend 15-25yrs \u201cenjoying himself\u201d. \n\nPresumably getting an education, a good job, a home, a family, the American dream type stuff, and just about the time his kids hit high school he\u2019s supposed to leave it all behind and come back and care for his sister, or, what, bring his sister to his home and expect his children and wife to take up his duties, or maybe he can have his savings wiped out trying to pay for the parts of his sisters care that aren\u2019t covered by public assistance. Do I have that right?",

But, no minor child should be made to give up their life to care for their sibling. That\u2019s straight up child abuse and that\u2019s what OP has been a victim of, abuse! \n\nAs for now, it should be OP\u2019s choice to take on that roll. Why in the holy hell should OP have to sacrifice their life for their parent\u2019s choices? OP isn\u2019t entitled to have an education, a job, a family of their own?

I didn't want to tell her, but she insisted on knowing why I don't have a libido anymore.\n\nShe started crying when I told her. She said she was sorry she made me go through that. I told her it's not her fault, and that it was my choice.\n\nWe just held each other for a while after that.\n\nWe decided that we'd go to couple's therapy, and when I'm ready, going to see a sex therapist.\n\nShe said she's sorry for how she's been acting, and that she's willing to be patient with me. I asked her what happens if I never get my libido back? She said she doesn't know, but she said she will be patient with me.\n\nSo yeah, I'll try to get my libido back. I don't feel comfortable discussing now, but something I'll want to mention during therapy is this pressure I'm getting from my gf. Like, maybe I'm overthinking, but I guess it feels like \"she's waiting for me to have sex\", idk but when I decided to be with her I was more of the mind \"I may never have sex again\" I wasn't WAITING for my gf to get better so we could have sex, I accept the fact that I could go sexless for the rest of my life.\n\nIdk, I guess this is a discussion for later ",

            "This is a really bad relationship for you OP. You injured yourself to match somebody else's needs. There is nothing healthy about that whatsoever. \n\nYou should get some therapy on your own, maybe read up on co-dependency, something.",
            "I\u2019m really sorry to hear about the struggles you and your girlfriend have been facing. It\u2019s clear that you both care deeply for each other and have been navigating some incredibly challenging terrain regarding your sexual relationship.\n\nFirstly, I want to commend you for your patience and empathy in supporting your girlfriend through her struggles with sex and therapy. It\u2019s evident that you prioritized her comfort and well-being, even at a significant cost to yourself. However, the method you used to suppress your libido\u2014hitting yourself and reinforcing negative thoughts\u2014is deeply concerning. This form of self-harm is not a healthy coping mechanism and has likely contributed to your current emotional and physical state.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to understand that your libido didn\u2019t just disappear; it was actively repressed through harmful means. This suppression has impacted your relationship with your sexuality and intimacy, creating a complex and painful dynamic between you and your girlfriend. Essentially, you forced yourself through a form of self-imposed conversion therapy rather than dealing with the incompatibility in terms of libido and making a healthy, informed decision about it. This suggests poor boundaries and possible codependent or people-pleasing behavior. You had other options but chose this path, and now both of you need to work through the aftermath.\n\nYour girlfriend\u2019s recent desire to become sexual with you, after years of not wanting sex, introduces a new dynamic that neither of you anticipated. Her reaction to your rejection and the subsequent fight indicates that there\u2019s a lot of unspoken tension and unresolved emotions between you two. It\u2019s understandable that she might feel confused and hurt, especially if she perceives your reluctance as a form of punishment or rejection.\n\nThe decision to pursue couples therapy and eventually see a sex therapist is a positive step forward. Therapy will provide a safe space to explore these complex feelings and dynamics, and to work through the impact of your past choices on your current relationship.\n\nDuring therapy, it\u2019s essential to address the pressure you feel from your girlfriend. Her patience and willingness to wait for you are important, but it\u2019s equally important that you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re on a timeline to \u201cfix\u201d yourself for her sake. Your healing and reconnection with your sexuality need to happen at a pace that feels right for you, without additional pressure.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s vital to address the trauma and self-harm involved in suppressing your libido. A skilled therapist can help you develop healthier coping mechanisms and begin to rebuild a positive relationship with your sexuality. This process might be slow, and it\u2019s okay to take the time you need.\n\nYour girlfriend\u2019s change of heart regarding sex is also something she might need to explore in individual therapy. Understanding her own journey and motivations can help both of you navigate this new phase in your relationship more effectively.\n\nFinally, remember that relationships, especially long-term ones, evolve and require constant communication, empathy, and mutual support. It\u2019s okay to feel uncertain and to need time to process everything. The goal is to move towards a relationship where both your needs and boundaries are respected and where you can find intimacy in a way that works for both of you.\n\nYour journey ahead might be challenging, but with professional support and honest communication, you can work towards a healthier and more fulfilling relationship.",

As someone who has self-harmed for years, I can tell you that this is a critical issue that affects your overall well-being and needs to be worked through, regardless of your relationship status.\n\nYour frustration with her current desire for sex is understandable, especially given how you\u2019ve conditioned yourself to be non-sexual for her sake. Her reaction\u2014getting mad and yelling\u2014was not appropriate, but it\u2019s also clear she was reacting to the tension and misunderstanding between you both.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial for both of you to understand that neither of you are villains here. You\u2019re both navigating a very complex issue that requires a lot of empathy, communication, and professional support to resolve. Therapy is the right step, and it will help you both understand each other\u2019s perspectives and find a way forward.\n\nIn the meantime, try to foster an environment where both of you can express your feelings without judgment or anger.
