I got a Wii U, I installed Tiramisu, but since I own only a Mac I cannot use this USB Helper tool that everyone apparently is using. The only way I managed to get some games working was with Loadline GX2 playing directly without installation, but in order for this to work I need the game unpacked in \"Code\", \"Content\" and \"Meta\" state. I only found one torrent tracker that had several roms in Loadline GX ready format, but I cannot find much else and even then most of them go black screen on me and don't load. \n\nThat being said could you help me with a workaround for installing games without USB Helper (it does not run on a Mac, I tried many times with Wine, Crossover and other) or if there is no option for me to install games, at least do you know where I could find games on a Loadline GX friendly format?",

Had all of the versions released at the same time instead of being separated over time, they probably all would've used the new engine and sprites. I would prefer to think of them more raw.\n\nIn Japan you got two main series games and a third improved main series game.In US you got two main series games using the improvements of the third game while still being the first two just with the third's improvements. This is partially backed up by the fact that the US remakes are FireRed and LeafGreen.\n\nOfcourse in reality this is all subjective and the best alternative would be to include both the JP and US releases sense in the end, the gen 1 version differences for the main games are equivalent if not more than the version differences.",

I bought one that had preloaded roms, and I found myself spending more time going through the menus trying to find a game rather than actually playing anything so I was wondering if there were any recommendations for roms or rom packs that are kind of \"samplers\" when it comes to games. I'm not really looking for complete collections of handhelds or systems but maybe a handful of games in different genres for each system that the RG35XXH can play. I'm not quite sure what games I am into but I am open to trying a bunch of different types.\n\nThanks in advance!"
