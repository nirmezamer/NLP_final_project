            "Yes lol",
            "Dude.. Like you absolutely need those 600fps. And yes - its normal - its only so much card can render and record at same time.\n\nBut dont worry - if you limit your FPS to 165 or 144 at your monitor refresh rate ( like it supposed to run) you wont loose even a single FPS when instant replay...\n\nRunning over 165 or 144 is useless (if you dont have 240 or 360hz monitor)",
            "Its rather your storage where its being saved or the cpu. Recording does not affect gpu performance this much",
            "cap fps below refresh rate",
            "Do you have a 600hz monitor?",
            "Valorant is one of those games that absolutely rely on high and stable framerate. Most importantly 1% fps. I upgraded from 5600x to 5700x3d and got absolutely massive boost in smoothness in this game, and no -  framerate that above your refresh rate is a good practic since you further decrease input lag",
            "That's in the menu. In game it should be around 180-300 avg depending on which map.",
            "Yeah I agree frametime and lag does get less with higher fps but once over like 300fps you won't notice a difference. If you do it's placebo. And actually over 500fps can cause some other issues with perceived smoothness.",
            "Even if your input lag decreases over 165FPS (6ms) and you get 4ms at 240FPS - that 2ms difference is so small comparing to your ping. Ping is usually 40-20ms so only 5-10% improvement you get from those 2ms.\n\nAverage human reaction time is 200ms so ... Useless..And not to mention 5-10ms lost on your monitor response lag - mouse lag 10ms ...\n\nAnd true - fast 3D cache CPU will smooth the game so much \ud83d\udc4d",
            "Ping and input lag are not comparable at all to the millisecond, there are many factors developers use to optimise for different pings per player to even the advantage (to a certain degree). Whereas a 10ms increase in input lag is far more noticeable. Human reaction time also has zero correlation with input lag, literally anyone can easily see the difference between 10ms and 1ms of input lag with a touch-cursor on a screen for example, [watch from around 1:15 in this video.](https://youtu.be/vOvQCPLkPt4?si=yO38y5rJGZ6tQvkx)",
            "True but what Im saying is - you will never get real 1ms (or even 4-6ms) true lag. Compensation for the ping is done - fine - but the added lag from mouse , monitor , game itself always comes up to 30-40ms at best. And since your reaction time is 150ms at best at highest skill players - its so negligible if you get 40 or 10ms lag even , You just cant feel that in the game.\n\n(fine - finger trick shows that the difference between 50 and 1ms is great - but running game ? Plus trough internet servers - you wont gain much advantage - if at all )\n\nWish I could test game like Apex Legends on lan - to see if lag will dissappear? I bet not - there still will be 20ms lag .."
