A crack in a phone screen. Duckling shit on your new car. Incomprehensible software. Mismatched buttons. You know, the little things. \n\nThis subreddit isn't meant to incite rage mobs that go after people. For that reason we say:\n\n#No reddit meta posts\n\nNo posts about being banned from subreddit. No posts about up- or down-votes. No posts about shitty moderators or users or subreddits. No posts about reddit. \n\nAll jokes and tomfoolery aside, that sort of thing gets us in trouble with site admins. If we allow one type of post about reddit it then very easily moprhs into allowing posts that directly call out other subreddits or users, we just can't allow any of it. \n\nThat rule already existed for years and we have just made it more clearly visible in the sidebar on old and new reddit. We're gonna be a little strict on it for a bit I'm afraid. \ud83e\udd7a\n\nThank you all for being awesome and have a very Merry Christmas!

It was actually disappointing that the only day it snowed, all the snow plows pushed the silky white snow over to curb where it turned grey from all the dirt and rocks and cars driving by, what got me thinking, all the salt they use to melt the ice on the roads must end up somewhere, snow melts along with the salt and makes its way into our sewer pipes just to be recycled back into the lakes and drinking water.  the day after it snowed was the warmest day we had since August rising to 15\u2022C in the middle of December. Like one day I\u2019m wearing boots and a jacket shovelling the snow then the next day I was out side in flip flops and shorts taking the garbage to out to the curb. From August to December we had what felt like 4 months of straight overcast and grey sky\u2019s. it mostly rained this December. Even the ski mountains that make their own snow had to shut down cause it wasn\u2019t cold enough. Now it\u2019s June and we\u2019re in a middle of a heat wave.\n\nThe area where I\u2019m from is not far from Toronto, about an hour drive. The whole drive you\u2019re passing factory\u2019s that are built right next to the lake and run 24 hours. All the smog and toxins running into the lake. It\u2019s not talked about very much but these are things we need to be more aware of and find alternative solutions. Instead we are closer to war and focus on reality tv or trying to be tic Tok famous.

However dry rot is also used broadly to describe degradation without contact with heavy moisture. So it can mean a few different things.\n\nA lot of closets have direct access to crawl spaces or attic spaces which are dark cool and often damp which is where fungus thrives. Closets are also normally small interior rooms with poor ventilation. Closets should be designed with some ventilation consideration. I've seen closets in newer construction have a vent that goes through a wall to a larger room. That or closets which have HVAC ducting.\n\nEdit: stagnant air can also promote mold growth so leaving on a small fan or leaving the closet door open can help along with laundering clothes that haven't been used in a few years.",
