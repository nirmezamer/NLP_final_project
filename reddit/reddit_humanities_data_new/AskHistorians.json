            "I'm a nontraditional student and community college history major based in Los Angeles. Prior to returning to college, I worked in film and television for over a decade (and I continue to work in the entertainment industry while completing my degree). I've always loved media history. If I ever answer a question here outside of the weekly posts, it's probably going to be about the intersection of mass media production and history.\n\nDue to a prior stint in college, I don't have a hell of a lot of room for electives or an additional minor. I also realize that it doesn't really matter what you \"specialize in\" as an undergrad. While in an ideal world I'd use my history degree to pivot into local public history work re media, film, or television, I also realize that there are USC Film PhDs who want all of those jobs, while I'm just a dropout who knows about film and also knows about history. And that in real life I'm probably going to stay a paralegal forever.\n\nMy community college offers a few film history courses in the media studies department, and depending where I finish my BA I could potentially get into some upper-division media history courses in the film department as a non-major. None of these fulfill any requirements for my history major, or any other requirements I still need to fulfill to graduate.\n\nIf I want to end up with a background in film history, what do I do?",

Why? Because oil, especially in the kinds of amounts needed for that purpose, was expensive, especially when plain old boiling water would serve the purpose just as well.\n\nIt made so much sense I believed it, but since then I've learned that just because something makes sense, that doesn't mean it's true.

Seward estimated in 1865 that perhaps 200,000 had been freed by that point which you'll see quoted in the literature a bit; others have put the figure closer to 400,000 and start with the 200,000 number.\n\nKeep in mind that one error frequently made about the Emancipation Proclamation is that it freed all enslaved people, which didn't happen until the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified.  Instead, it freed only those in states in rebellion partially via powers Lincoln gained from the Confiscation Act of 1862 and left out the border states along with a couple of regions occupied by Union troops.\n\nThis is briefly covered in a lot of the literature; Guelzo's *Lincoln's Emancipation's Proclamation* focuses in more detail on the immediate effects and reactions to it.",
            "This [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/26l4ae/was_boiling_oil_ever_regularly_used_in_siege/) by u/idjet confirms that pouring vats of boiling oil over the walls is unlikely to have been a common defense, for all the reasons you gave. However, as u/idjet mentions, there was a lot of improvisation involved in siege warfare, and, if available, boiling oil could be one of the different dangerous materials poured on attackers. \n\nThis predates the Middle-Ages (including the improvisional part!): in 67 CE, the defenders of the Jewish city of Yodfat used scalding oil against Roman forces who were trying to climb the walls, as told by Flavius Josephus in *The Jewish War*:\n\n>The situation was critical, and Josephus taught by necessity - always quick to improvise when despair applies the spur - ordered boiling oil to be poured on the soldiers under the shields. As his men had it ready, numbers of them from every side poured quantities of it on the Romans, followed by the vessels still hissing from the flames. Scalded and burnt, the Romans broke up their formation and in agonizing pain rolled down from the wall ;'for the oil instantly ran under their armour and over their entire bodies from head to foot, consuming their flesh as relentlessly as a fire, being by nature quick to grow hot and slow to cool because of its fattiness. Imprisoned in their cuirasses and helmets they could not escape from the scalding fluid. Leaping into the air and contorted with pain they fell from the wooden bridges one after another, while those who retired ran into their own men as they pressed forward, making themselves an easy target for the enemy shafts.\n\nBradbury (1992) cites the siege of Harfleur by Henry V in 1415, where French defenders resisted an attempt at storm \"with boiling oil and boiling water, fat, fire-arrows, quicklime and sulphur powder.\" The use of boiling oils and fats against English attackers was also reported during the siege of Orl\u00e9ans by the author of the *Diary of the siege*. On 21 October 1428 (before the arrival of Joan of Arc):\n\n>The women of Orl\u00e9ans also helped a great deal, as they never ceased to diligently carry to those defending the boulevard [the road leading to the city through the Tourelles Bridge] several necessary items such as water, oil, boiling grease, lime, ashes and caltrops.\n\nAnother example cited by Bradbury is the siege of the rebellious castle of Montreuil-Bellay by Geoffrey V Plantagen\u00eat, Count of Anjou, in 1151. However, the oil was not used defensively but offensively, by the attackers. Geofffrey got the idea by reading *De Re Militari* by Roman writer Vegetius and he created a medieval version of Greek Fire. This is told in the chronicle *Historia Gaufredi, ducis Normannorum et comitis Andegavorum* by Jean de Marmoutier, 1180.\n\n>So he ordered an iron jar, tied with iron bands and hanging from a strong chain, to be filled with the oil of nuts and the seeds of cannabis and flax. The opening of the jar was to be sealed with an appropriate iron strip and firmly locked. Then he ordered the jar to be replaced in the heated furnace for a long time until the whole thing glowed with overpowering heat, so that the oil bubbling inside was boiling. The chain was cooled by throwing water over it, then the jar was taken out and fixed to the pole of a mangonel. With careful aim and great force, while still glowing, it was thrown by the engineers at the strong beams placed in the breaches. The contents were expelled by the impact, and the discharged matter caused a fire. Then the outflowing oil merged with the balls of fire, supplying food for the flames. The licking flames, vomiting in sudden increase, burned three houses, and hardly allowed men to escape.\n\nGeoffrey took the castle and crushed the rebellion.\n\nIt would be interesting to review the various instances of the utilization of boiling oil in siege warfare, but the general idea is that, when it happened, it was part of the improvised nature of siege defenses - people would use whatever was available to them -, rather than a standard method.\n\n**Sources**\n\n* Bradbury, Jim.

            "# E X E T E R\n\nContrary to popular belief, the cities of the Medieval Period most usually had aqueducts, fountains, conduits, and other water-bearing technologies that deliver drinking water to their populace. There any number of cities we can cite here for aqueductal excellence, even if we exclude capitals.\n\nBut for uniqueness in water conveyance? **Exeter**. I could go on and on about the user end of the aqueducts (including the bit where the Medieval-era conduits survived all the way into the 1800s and were still regarded as the best \"for tea and pea soup\"), but the real interesting part is the vaults. The city has undeground passageways, sometimes called 'vaults' in the official documentation, where the city plumber and other workmen could descend into to perform maintenance and repairs on the pipes of the city aqueducts. These passageways survive until today, where I understand they are one of Exeter's tourist attractions.\n\nFountains, the ignorant can excuse and the ill-intentioned can poo-poo as being simply decorative. But the vaults? You can't argue with the vaults.\n\nFor anyone who does not yet live in Exeter but would like to explore the aqueducts, I commend to your attention Mark Stoyle's *Water in the City: The Aqueducts and Underground Passages of Exeter*.\n\nOKAY FINE I WANT TO CITE SIENA BECAUSE OF THE BOTTINI BUT I HAVE A BOOK ON EXETER SO EXETER IT IS AND I REALLY WANT TO GO TO THE VAULTS DANGIT",

            "While not really touching on the \"how it should work in theory\" part, my [answer here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1bomvu3/was_there_ever_evidence_of_any_actual/kwqqg3p/) might be of some interest to you, as it talks about some of the practical politics of the time",
            "Yes.\n\nSee: Jean Edward Smith's *FDR*",
            "I recently wrote an undergraduate research paper that surveyed current approaches towards contested antiquities and human remains, with a focus more on return (vs. displaying or not displaying) and on items linked to indigenous communities or colonized peoples. So I can weigh in a bit here, though more on that sort of thing and less on, for example, the ethics of something like Philadelphia's Mutter Museum which is more about the history of medicine and the study of the human body.\n\nThe first thing to know is that historical sites and other research and exhibition contexts (museums, research institutes, exhibitions, etc) in the US are generally under the jurisdiction of the Native American Graves and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), which recognized that all human remains, including the remains of indigenous people, belong to their lineal descendants and Native American tribes or other indigenous organizations. NAGPRA requires all US museums and cultural institutions receiving federal funding to inventory their collections and return indigenous human remains and sacred cultural objects to lineal descendants or other officially recognized groups. So if this museum receives federal funds, and there is any possibility that this skeleton was that of an indigenous American, they are likely in breach of NAGPRA. (Citation: [NAGPRA info page on the National Park Service website](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nagpra/index.htm)) I think there are potentially still institutions in the US which have indigenous human remains in their collections, because the inventory and return process can be onerous (though they've had like 35 years to do it at this point), but it seems egregious to me that an American museum would be exhibiting indigenous remains in 2024. \n\nThere have been international laws in force since the 1960s restricting global trade in antiquities and human remains. Those laws aren't retroactive, meaning that if an American or European museum was already displaying human remains stolen from former colonies prior to the time these laws were adopted, there isn't a lot the former colonies can do beyond asking nicely for their return. It's currently in pretty bad taste for large \"universal\" museums to display this sort of thing, though, and would probably invite requests for repatriation. (Citation: [Folarin Shyllon](https://go-gale-com.lavc.idm.oclc.org/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=lavc_main&id=GALE%7CA606173686&v=2.1&it=r&aty=ip), [Carsten Stahn](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2894347424?accountid=40027&parentSessionId=hKZEHqbQK80wo7F4p4ipaE3TbNzWZmej0BN4CMoQEwA%3D&pq-origsite=primo&sourcetype=Scholarly%20Journals) - note, both of these articles are on the topic of the Benin Bronzes, but the international laws discussed pertain to the taking of human remains as well.)\n\nI'm not aware of any laws that would govern human remains in general, which are not indigenous in origin or otherwise removed involuntarily from their original context. One thing that became clear to me when I was working on my paper is that while there has been a lot of focus on the return of human remains that are in dispute in some way (notably indigenous and colonized peoples), the ethics of displaying human remains in general seems to be more of an open debate. While I haven't read this book and couldn't get access via my university's library online, [this seems like an interesting text to look into](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/human-remains/000FBC59747ABDBA00A8AB736AE054D9#fndtn-information) for a thorough discussion of the ethics of displaying human remains in general. It's worth noting that this book also seems to discuss research and curation of human remains in the context of repatriation, meaning an assumption that the remains in question fundamentally don't belong to the museum or the home culture that museum represents. I'm not sure if there is any ethical concern about displaying the skeleton of someone who donated their remains to science after death, or individuals represented in some way by the museum's home culture who have been dead for centuries with no extant groups to claim them (for example a Scandinavian museum displaying the skeleton of a Viking warrior). But maybe this book or other current literature goes into it?",
            "I don't know how one could quantify popularity here, but *possibly* the Dancing Baby gif, as it is considered one of the first internet memes, *period*, and certainly one of the first to gain widespread awareness in the mainstream. I think it is easy to argue that relative to other 'memes' extant at the same time, its degree of awareness in comparison was larger nearly any other ratio since. [See this CNN article for instance](http://www.cnn.com/TECH/9801/19/dancing.baby/index.html), and of course the [Know Your Meme write-up](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dancing-baby).",

            "First off, I only realised a bit ago that the 'you' up there is difficult. It's intended to be a general 'you', not a specific 'you-as-AmbassadorCosh', and if I have caused offence, I most deeply apologise.\n\nNow, with your new stipulation in mind, it still doesn't work. We have another relevant u/the_howling_cow post: [How far back in the queue would you need to be to survive the landing of Omaha beach?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4w1azp/how_far_back_in_the_queue_would_you_need_to_be_to/)\n\nI highly suspect that the original on LinkedIn is based on a garbled retelling of what happened to Company A of the 116th Infantry Regiment, as dramatised in Saving Private Ryan. Let's quote the_howling_cow: \"of the 170 men who landed, 91 were killed outright and 64 were wounded.\" Translating into percentages for easier comparison with the LinkedIn post, that's 170 men landed, 15 effectives left, 53% dead, 37% wounded, for a total casualty rate of 91%. (Remember! 'Casualty' applies to killed, wounded, and missing. If you take an MG-42 burst that takes you out of action, but you're still alive, *you are still a casualty!*)\n\nCo.A/116 is, however, most unusual, and it also had the supreme ill-luck of landing straight in front of a German fortified position with a well-defined killing zone. Other units in the first wave had different fortunes. Some certainly got a severe mauling (Companies F and G of the 116th landed near Company A and were torn up as well, though not nearly as bad), but others managed to land reasonably intact (Company L of the 16th Infantry Regiment landed on the extreme left, and while it did take casualties, was still a unified unit when it led the way inland).\n\nRe age, it's the bit that comes closest to being true, but only in the most technical of terms. Here's another the_howling_cow post on [soldier ages](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7c725k/what_was_the_average_age_of_the_soldiers_that/).\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is *technically* true...if you restrict the sample size to six boats out of the *forty-seven* that landed on that half of Omaha in the first wave, and only if you misinterpret 'casualty' to mean 'dead'.\n\nI also used Balkoski's *Omaha Beach* for most of the above; the first-wave boat count comes from Zaloga's *Omaha Beach*, as published by Osprey.",

            "One major reason is that while currants are a \u2018basic fruit\u2019 in the UK, they are not as well known in the US, and this is because they are not as widely cultivated or sold. This in turn is due to the fact that blackcurrants were not native to the US, and were banned federally (usually cited as in 1911, with differing sources, but certainly by the 1920s), because they spread the white pine blister rust, a fungus which damages white pines, which are very important for US ecosystems and the timber industry. Those currants already in the US were slowly eradicated across the 1920s-1930s.\n\nIn the UK and much of the rest of Europe, the worst affected white pines are not native, and while the disease can affect others to a lesser extent, there were efforts to clear these out. Currants were after all native and long part of the culture, so bans were not a consideration.\n\nThe federal government legalised them again in 1966, though many states kept their own bans. But most of the core, popular artificial flavours were developed in the decades before then, as the sweets/candy industry and industrial food chemistry, including flavourants like the esters used for artificial blackcurrant flavour, exploded.\n\nThe idea of sweets with various fruit flavours - marked by different colourants in a simple colour-coding - slowly developed in the same period across the Atlantic, and blackcurrants became one of the defaults only where they were well-known. But artificial grape flavour is far from unknown in the UK, and there are even popular (non-alcoholic!) \u2018wine gum\u2019 pastilles. But this would be the main reason for the lack of blackcurrant awareness in the US.\u00a0",
            "Wine gums these days don\u2019t have a grape flavour, they have standard uk fruit sweet flavours (lemon, lime, orange, raspberry etc). Did they originally have a grape flavour?",

            "The ban on currants also roughly coincided with prohibition. As a result, wine producers had a massive oversupply of grapes. This drove down the price of grapes and raisins.

Americans just developed a love of grape flavor.",

            "As far as I can tell they were just the usual british fruit flavours just with wine names molded on them. The original maynards family specifically ensured there was no wine or wine related flavour in them as they were part of the temperance movement and were pushing sweets as an alternative to alcohol.\n\nIn the US the black one has been grape (and the red one cherry as opposed to summer berry/strawberry in the UK) for the reasons previously discussed.",

            "Wow! A question I can actually answer!\n\nThe Guanche people were the native inhabitants of the Canary Islands, a group of islands off the coast of Africa now belonging to Spain. While their genetic origins are not confirmed, studies have shown that they share a lot of DNA with North Africans of Berber ancestry. They did not have seafaring skills, so it is unclear how they got to the islands. They may have been transported there by another group, or have previously had boats but lost their seafaring skills over time. The fact they couldn\u2019t travel over water meant they were incredibly isolated.\n\nIn 1341, the King of Portugal sent explorers to the Canaries. Explorers from other countries soon followed, but none established permanent settlements in the 14th century. In 1402, French forces captured Lanzarote, an island in the Canaries. This was not the first colonialist action in the islands, however; before 1402, hundreds of Guanche had been captured for slavery.\n\nIt is estimated that there were 80,000 Guanche people in 1478. In 1479, the Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas recognized Spanish sovereignty over the islands. The Spanish wanted the Canaries to be an available stop for other voyages, but it took the Spanish a while to conquer all of the islands, though. In 1495, the Spanish conquered Tenerife, the largest of the islands, after two invasions. The Guanche\u2019s isolation made them vulnerable to diseases from the Spanish. Spanish fighters also had horses, unlike the Guanche. Many Guanche were forced to assimilate, while others were enslaved. \n\nBy 1541, there was reportedly only one Guanche person left on the islands. While many modern-day Canary Islanders have Guanche DNA, and some aspects of modern-day Canarian culture have Guanche origins, Guanche society was completely destroyed. Guanche DNA is mostly matrilineal, as Guanche men were killed and deported by the Spanish. Women had to assimilate into Spanish society. The Guanche as a people no longer exist due to Spanish genocidal efforts.\n\nI hope this was useful!\n\nSources:\n\nFregel, Rosa, et al. \u201cDemographic History of Canary Islands Male Gene-Pool: Replacement of Native Lineages by European.\u201d BMC Evolutionary Biology, vol. 9, no. 1, 2009, p. 181, https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-9-181.\n\nRodriguez, Vicente. \u201cCanary Islands | Geography, Facts, & History.\u201d Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2019, www.britannica.com/place/Canary-Islands.\n\nRodr\u00edguez-Varela, Ricardo, et al. \u201cGenomic Analyses of Pre-European Conquest Human Remains from the Canary Islands Reveal Close Affinity to Modern North Africans.\u201d Current Biology, vol. 27, no. 21, Nov. 2017, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2017.09.059.\n\nWills, Matthew. \u201cThe Canary Islands: First Stop of Imperialism.\u201d JSTOR Daily, 3 June 2023, daily.jstor.org/the-canary-islands-first-stop-of-imperialism/.",

            "There's one crucial point to clarify at the outset: Mao's grip on power wasn't particularly strong in the four years preceding the Cultural Revolution.\n\nFollowing his disastrous policies that led to at least 15 million deaths between 1959 and 1961, Mao was forced to admit his mistakes openly before a gathering of 7,000 high-ranking officials in early 1962. He subsequently entrusted the country's administration to Liu Shaoqi, the nominal head of state at the time.\n\nHowever, Liu, only five years younger than Mao, seemed to be a growing threat to Mao's authority during his three years in power. To regain control, Mao devised a strategy to incite social unrest against the government rather than directly confront Liu.\n\nHe began with subtle maneuvers that Liu was hesitant to oppose. In November 1965, he initiated a discussion on a historical play, pressuring senior officials to agree with his assessment. This resulted in the removal of those who disagreed, some of whom were key allies of Liu.\n\nMao then sharpened his focus on Liu. In May 1966, he encouraged teachers and students at Peking University (then and still China's most prestigious university) to publicly criticize their university leaders and local government through large-scale posters. These attacks inspired similar actions by young people across China, effectively paralyzing Liu's government.\n\nThe climax arrived in August 1966 with the publication of Mao's own poster, marking his final assault on Liu. Within a week, Liu was officially disqualified as Mao's successor.\n\nAlthough the political battle at the highest level neared its conclusion, a fierce struggle continued between those following Mao's teachings to overthrow their leaders and those currently in charge of government institutions.\n\nSchools became one of the most intense battlegrounds due to Mao's appeal to young people. Many students who disliked studying or struggled with impulse control were labeled pro-Mao, while many teachers were seen as anti-Mao.\n\nIn answer to your question, those who shut down schools were likely pro-Mao. However, Mao's teachings were merely a tool they used to justify and legitimize their behavior. Both sides wielded Mao's words as weapons.\n\nThe pro-Mao\u2019s impetus to challenge the established system wasn't solely self-motivated. They were victims of the prevailing political climate. Mao's repeated calls for public defiance of authority and established rules were taken to the extreme, where any incomplete challenge was seen as a betrayal. Ultimately, the desire for political correctness led everyone to abandon basic ethical principles during the revolution, unleashing the unchecked violence of human nature. In this atmosphere, any attempt to maintain a moral conscience was risky and could be labeled evil.\n\nDue to this stifling environment, many good people were forced to relinquish their moral compass and commit crimes during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nHowever, as many similar movements showed, the irrational passions fueling the Revolution were unsustainable. Once everything was destroyed, a sense of emptiness prevailed, eventually leading to a return to peace.\n\nThe intense conflict between pro-Mao and anti-Mao factions had largely subsided by 1968. To address the large number of urban students with pent-up energy, Mao promoted a program to send them to the countryside. Roughly 16 million students were mandatorily resettled between 1968 and 1978.\n\nBoth the earlier conflict and the subsequent resettlement were nationwide phenomena, though primarily concentrated in large cities. These densely populated areas provided more people to be involved and more targets to be attacked. When surrounded by a large crowd, herd mentality can be significantly magnified.\n\n**Further Reading**\n\nFor a comprehensive understanding of the Cultural Revolution's background, Roderick MacFarquhar's three-volume work, *The Origins of the Cultural Revolution*, is an excellent resource.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, books mentioned by Kubly can provide insights into the daily lives of people during the Revolution from 1966 to 1976.",

            "This is a pretty huge topic, and I've been out of academia long enough to not feel comfortable answering it, however I do have some book recommendations if you'd like to learn more. \n\nWild Swans, by Jung Chang. A family history by the author, which covers a lot of the 20th century including the cultural revolution and gives great context to it. The author herself was a red guard, but her parents were also targeted and her father was tortured due to criticisms of the movement, and she was later sent to the countryside for education and thought reform  You get a broad picture of things from her experiences.\n\nBorn Red, by Yuan Gao. This is a chronicle of the author's experiences during the cultural revolution but with place and people names changed to protect identities. It deals with a lot of the questions you ask in the post as he was a student during this period. It really gets into the details of local politics and the murkiness of who is \"pro-mao\" and \"anti-mao\" as you put it.\n\nBalzac and the little Chinese Seamstress, by Dai Sijie. This is fiction based in part on the author's experiences. It gives a look into the experience of being at a reeducation-through-labor camp and the influence of foreign literature during the time period. A fun read, and there's also a movie from the early 2000s so it's probably the most digestible of these three, but also covers the least ground on the topic \n\nI recognize suggesting you read an entire book or three kind of defeats the purpose of posting here, and I hope someone more knowledgeable can provide a good answer. That said, the cultural revolution has a lot of complexity and nuance, much of it based distinctly in Chinese culture and history, and China's unique experience of communism. I think it's very helpful to have the perspective of someone who has lived in that environment, and so memoirs like these are really educational.",

            "Cocoon, Zhang Yueran. Certainly a little more \u201ccasual\u201d and easier to read than the other suggestions, but still very insightful. Through the eyes of two childhood friends (from the 80s), we see the actions their grandparents took that shaped the following generations\u2019 lives and identities, from both sides of the Cultural Revolution.",
            "I\u2019ve read Wild Swans, and the biography of Mao, by the same author (plus her husband Jon Halliday) between the two I felt I had a relatively 360 degree view the second book appeared to be very deeply researched BUT I am aware that I am dependent on one author, so I would be interested in any view on Jung Chang/Jon Halliday. Are those books considered reliable perspectives by the academic community?\n\n(Reposting as a reply because I accidentally posted as a reply to the main question - hope this doesn\u2019t appear spammy!)"
