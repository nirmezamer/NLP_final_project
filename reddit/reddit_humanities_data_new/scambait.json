            "Honestly until he said the 'no sex' thing, I'm not even sure he was even reading any of the replies. He just seemed to by copy/pasting in the next part of the convo no matter what you said until then.",
            "Bit of a sad update. Well, not really. He deserved it. Looks like our \"Christopher\" did something to get his page taken down before I could reply. He sent a message asking me if I'm helping just after midnight. When I saw it and went to reply, I got a message saying I couldn't send. I went to go look at his Facebook page, and it's been taken down. Our man did something big to get that to happen as Facebook is super slow to take these scammers down.  Myself, and others, have sent hundreds of messages to Facebook just to have Facebook say the page isn't in violation  of TOS. Oh well it was fun while it lasted.",
            "To paraphrase a movie, this is the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard a scammer say and has made everyone else who reads it stupider.",
            "Lol",
            "Ya, I can tell this one is 16-19. MAYBE 20, but that's pushing it.  I don't know if he will come back.  I may have fried his brain. Maybe he will talk to his Oga if he is lucky enough to have one.  Tho, based on how this has gone so far, I don't think he has more than maybe a few classmates to help.",
            "Lol ya but with my decoder ring, I think I got the gist... well, nope. Lol, maybe he will surprise and amaze if he comes back, this time, he might make sense. Tho, it wouldn't be half as fun if we can understand him lol",

            "For the most part he wasn't copy pasting because I was always able to see him type away. I do know he was only reading some of what I said,  most of them don't read what we say. I mean I had to KEEP asking him about him \"being in me\" to even get him to say \"no sex\" lol. Poor village boy was just too focused one what is almost certainly one of his first scams that he wanted to make sure he got it right.",

            "Ya, copy/paste is vastly different than just plowing through a conversation just to keep the script going. One is using someone else words verbatim, and the other is just full-on ignoring everything, but the end goal and hoping the word salad used earns money.  Both tactics ofc can lead to funny results OR remittance.\n\n\"Which would you have preferred, sexy 'being in you', or texas chainsaw massacre 'inside you' like a human based skin suit?\"\n\nWhy would those be the things I would have to choose from?",
