            "I saw a TikTok talking about how, due to dating apps/social media/constant access and exposure to pornography, that we are \u201cnovelty chasing\u201d when it comes to searching for relationships. We have \u201cstandards\u201d that we don\u2019t meet ourselves and have dehumanized each other to the point where we rank ourselves algorithmically/objectively when humans by nature can\u2019t be ranked that way.\n\nIt\u2019s not suggesting that we don\u2019t have reasonable standards, red flags, and compatibility factors that we consider but that we\u2019ve gone so far beyond that.\n\nJust a TikTok, but it really made me think.",
            "I\u2019ve linked to the news release in the post above. In this comment, for those interested, here\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12929\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nAre all single people insecure? When we think about people who have been single for a long time, we may assume it\u2019s because single people have insecurities that make it difficult for them to find a partner or maintain a relationship.\n\nBut is this true? Or can long-term single people also be secure and thriving?\n\nOur latest research published in the Journal of Personality suggests they can. However, perhaps unsurprisingly, not everybody tends to thrive in singlehood. Our study shows a crucial factor may be a person\u2019s attachment style.\n\nSinglehood is on the rise\n\nSinglehood is on the rise around the world. In Canada, single status among young adults aged 25 to 29 has increased from 32% in 1981 to 61% in 2021. The number of people living solo has increased from 1.7 million people in 1981 to 4.4 million in 2021.\n\nAt the same time, evidence suggests many single people are choosing to remain single and living happy lives.\n\nLooking at our results more closely, we found four distinct subgroups of singles:\n\nsecure singles are relatively comfortable with intimacy and closeness in relationships (22%)\n\nanxious singles question whether they are loved by others and worry about being rejected (37%)\n\navoidant singles are uncomfortable getting close to others and prioritise their independence (23% of younger singles and 11% of older long-term singles)\n\nfearful singles have heightened anxiety about abandonment, but are simultaneously uncomfortable with intimacy and closeness (16% of younger singles and 28% of older long-term singles).\n\nThese findings should be considered alongside several relevant points. First, although most singles in our samples were insecure (78%), a sizeable number were secure and thriving (22%).\n\nFurther, simply being in a romantic relationship is not a panacea. Being in an unhappy relationship is linked to poorer life outcomes than being single.",

            "Time and time again we see economic instability reducing the numbers of people looking for long-term relationships either through them choosing not to pursue a relationship or just not having the time to commit to finding relationships.\n\nWhy would someone choose to get start dating or get married and start a family when they arent sure they will be in the same job/house/city this time next year?\n\nWhy would you expect someone who works 80+ hours a week and barely squeaks by living in a rented place with 3 other people to have the time or energy to seek romance?\n\nCorporate profits are reaching unstable peaks and they really cant cut costs any more without simply returning to feudalism so either that happens, or we see a revolution of young people demanding the end to endless profit chasing.",
            "The study mentions attachment theory in reference to the security of singles. That may play a part, but it would be interesting to see if they're secure financially, have friends or a social life, and how stressful their job is as I believe those also have an effect on what shapes the security of an individual and may shape whether someone's \"attachment style\" changes.",
            "It takes one truly awful past partner to make one really consider whether or not they want to go at it again.\n\nMy ex was manipulative, leeching, coercive, and full of psychological dysfunction.  I was her provider, her bodyguard, her motivator, her social life, her trophy, her therapist, and in many instances, what felt like her father.\n\nWhile I was devastated when I caught her cheating, I've since concluded I'd have been better off never having dated her.  I've reclaimed so much of my time and inner peace.  I've expanded my hobbies and saved so much more money.  I see my friends regularly.  I'm not constantly under a microscope of silent judgment and walking on eggshells hoping she won't get upset about the tiniest of things.  She wasted years of my life, and in one year I've done more for myself than all those others combined.\n\nI'd love to meet and love someone again.  But that sense of trust is gone.  I'm loving myself these days, moreso than I ever have before, and I don't want to lose myself just to fill a body in the bed and have some company after work.  I've spent my entire life since childhood setting myself to be able to provide for myself--minimizing risk and pursuing stability over enjoyment when it comes to my career and finances and preceding education--I want my time to be mine.  To do what I want to do, when I want to.  To build a workshop in the garage space rather than make compromises.  To retire two decades early.  To stay up late.  To face no pressure of doing more than the amount I push myself so hard to do.  To grapple with only my problems that I'm determined to solve, and not to be so burdened to coach someone else through theirs as well.\n\nI miss the good company and the intimacy dearly.  Those early honeymoon days.  But nothing is worth sacrificing what I've built for myself in all the sacrifice I've made to achieve it.  Perhaps someone like-minded will stumble into my lap--but until then, I'd much rather be myself than risk being someone else's entirely.",

It's essential to learn to be content and complete by yourself first, especially as an anxious person. When the time comes to be with someone, the idea of being alone again doesn't scare you.\nAvoidants might be more difficult to heal though.",

Add to that growing up in a large household where I was ostracized and abused and grew up sheltered, and you have a decent idea of my social skills in my early 20s.\n\n In my 30s, things are so much better. I'm not seeing anyone and haven't been in a real committed relationship for 11+ years. I've dated plenty and at one point during a low point in my life dated a guy off and on for some time who just wanted me to be the side chick. What a waste of time. \n\nI do what I want, eat what I want, watch what I want, do the hobbies I want, and I have NO one to clean up after other than myself and my little sister.

            "Personally I find being single extremely difficult, but I think a lot of that is from not really having experienced relationships so it's hard to have a full perspective. I was in a long distance relationship for a year and that's about all I've had. So as I approach my mid-30's it's hard to feel comfortable alone as I feel like I've missed out or feel like I'm not good enough. I've never lived with another person so in my mind I romanticise it, even though I'm sure it's not always easy sharing a space. Stuff like that is hard to get over and feel happy alone.",

Don't give up your singlehood just because it seems like the thing you're supposed to do, or fear of being alone. And don't avoid someone you find yourself attracted to, just because of fear of attachment. Your happiness is paramount and must be defended, and it can be shared without sacrificing it for someone else.",

Personally I am asexual and do not want a romantic partner, and I'm very independent and don't even want a roommate. I realized this facet of myself when I was pretty young and the importance of having relationships in my life that are strong and present -- just not romantic. I keep a healthy social network. Even when bad things in my life hit I feel like I have a lot of people there for me - I suffered job loss a few years ago and there were friends at my house almost daily for support. Singles who lack this type of support network are gonna be much more susceptible to the negatives of singlehood, like feelings of loneliness, abandonment, insecurity, etc.",

            "No doubt that there are some singles which self-proport to be secure and thriving.\n\nHowever I feel the study poorly addresses the factor of age. The spread is heavily biased towards young-ish working age people, and these are the people who tend to have family support as well as who need less support. People who can get social fufilment from work and peers in ways that older people, especially at or near retirement age, typically cannot. The age group where it's viable to go out and meet random friends or hook-ups. \n\nWhich is to say that while singles may at times self-proport to be secure and thriving, this is likely a relatively fragile state of affairs vs. those with partners, and later on, a family with adult children. \n\nI would want a study like this to take more focus on age and whether singlehood turns out to be self-reported as favourable in the long run, as even if it's favourable to some while younger, I would imagine it's likely that many or most of that same group may change their mind about whether it was a good decision in hindsight.",

Seriously asking because I was unaware of that in the past and it would be interesting to peruse these patterns.\n\nIf anything I would think the opposite with economics and would assume a lot of people would seek longterm relationships out of economic necessity. A partnership can save a couple a ton of money in housing/transit/utility/other costs and I think a lot of people maintain relationships that they would otherwise leave just for economic stability. I think historically most relationships have had an enormous economic consideration, likely larger than a romantic consideration.\n\nThough surely there are numerous reasons, I would think the decline in longterm relationships is more related to cultural reasons stemming from changing social mores, technology, and other psychological pressures from the way society functions, such as the disposable nature of modern relationships, the general hedonism of consumer culture, and social isolation stemming from technology. \n\nThe precarious nature of employment and cost of living is definitely a part of that, as you say, and it is definitely hard to allocate time for a relationship if you are overworked and stressed, great points. \n\nSociology is so fascinating to me and its really interesting how many things can influence the shape of behaviour and civilization despite the many gloomy aspects of it all.",

I was surprised when many more homes went to short trem AIrBnB rentals like 2 just down the block from me. I was frustrated when governments  resisted allowing zoning for modest multigenerational homes. \nWe wonder why so many young people don't even bother, and the more blind and arrogant amongst us call them lazy. My mother and father in the 1950s dreamed about getting enough money to buy a little 800 square foot house that was built for veterans after WW2. They got one and were able to get even nicer ones.

And a lot of people who have learned to be happy single are also horribly jaded and just gave up, which is fine. But that doesn't necessarily indicate a healthy/happy person just bc it's easier for them to not connect with a partner anymore. I think it's really concerning, the rise of people living alone so much. I feel like people think you can just force yourself into banishing the desire for a partner from your life, when most people can't. If we all went back to living in small communal communities where we were working together to survive every day...it might be different. But that isn't the world we live in. Romantic relationships being fundamental can be debated, but I'd argue that the clear desire that the majority of people have for one is enough evidence that it's fundamental for a lot of people.",

In this comment, for those interested, here\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2310291121\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nEvery few seconds, we blink our eyes \u2014 a simple, involuntary act. While it\u2019s commonly understood that blinking keeps our eyes lubricated, a new study by researchers from the University of Rochester has uncovered a more intricate role: blinking also helps our brains process visual information more effectively. Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the study sheds light on how these brief closures of our eyes contribute to visual perception.\n\nHumans spend about 3 to 8 percent of their waking hours with their eyes closed due to blinking. Given that blinking briefly obscures our vision, one might wonder why it occurs so frequently. Traditional explanations have highlighted its role in maintaining eye moisture and preventing dryness.\n\nHowever, the frequency of blinks suggests that there might be additional functions beyond lubrication. Researchers Bin Yang, Janis Intoy, and Michele Rucci sought to explore these potential functions, particularly how blinking might influence visual processing in the brain.\n\nThe researchers found that when participants blinked during the presentation of the visual stimulus, their performance in identifying the grating\u2019s orientation improved significantly compared to when they blinked before the stimulus appeared. This improvement was evident in both the accuracy of their responses and their sensitivity to the visual details, measured by a standard discrimination sensitivity index.\n\nThe researchers hypothesized that this improvement was due to the luminance changes caused by blinks. Luminance refers to the brightness of the visual stimulus. When we blink, the temporary closure of our eyes creates abrupt changes in luminance. These changes may help reset the visual information entering the eye, thereby aiding the brain in processing the visual input more effectively.",

            "Current portable gravimeters are accurate to 1 microgal, \n\nApprox. 1.02 x 10^(-9) g\n\nThe super conducting gravimeter (SG), that isn't portable and needs a stable setup in a laboratory, has a theoretical resolution of to 0.01 microgal, \n\nApprox. 1.02 x 10^(-11) g\n\nThe super conducting gravimeter is rediculously sensitive. One lab demonstrates the SG's sensitivity to visitors by using a heavy iron plate on wheels, that rolled under the SG, which increases gravity. At a conference, a scientist showed gravity slowly in increse over 6 hours at a SG site in Finland, but the increase paused for an hour. He explained it pause happened when workmen, who were clearing snow off the laboratory roof, took a break. \n\nBut the SG doesn't reach 0.01 microgal accuracy due to internal and external environmental noise. Of these sources of noise, environmental noise is the most significant factor. Sources of noise includes rain, snow, temperature and air pressure changes, and wind (which affect the density of the atmosphere and thus force of gravity), as well as more distant sources of artificial and natural noise, road traffic, electromagnetic interference, tides (daily and long term), storm waves (even hundreds of miles away), Earth's Incessant Free Ocilation (the Earth constantly vibrates due to earthquakes, storms and ocean currents). \n\nA large proportion of the literature on SG involves the identification, modelling and elimination, as best as possible, noise. This is how the SG discovered e.g. the Pole Tides effects on gravity, 6mm variation in the level of the Earth's tides near the poles due to the Chandler Wobble, a 433 day variation of the Earth's rotation of 9 meters. \n\nThus, a more precise measurement of gravity will run into the same sources of noise as the SG and limit real would accuracy and precision. They will attempt to identify and remove noise like with the SG. But I'm sure if more precision would help. The SG seems to have hit its limit at 0.01 microgal. \n\nhttps://microglacoste.com/introducing-the-cg-6-gravity-meter/\n\nVerma, S.K., Kumar, N. and Pal, S.K., 2023.

            "I don\u2019t think anyone is meant to be surprised, this is a step towards getting the drug approved for more conditions and thus more accessible to people who need it",
            "That's the important bit. All the unfortunate people with normal bmi and apnea aren't getting a new treatment option, which sucks for them.",
            "Damn i had a glimer of hope XD",
            "What we really need now is just good data on long term use, because that's what it will take to beat these conditions given current circumstances.",
            "I hope so! I was excited when I read the headline. I have sleep apnea and my weight is just fine - pretty fit. It\u2019s a scary thing to have. I just stop breathing in my sleep, sometimes. I can feel it. It doesn\u2019t feel healthy.",
            "That all plays a role and is addressed if you're ever treated for sleep apnea. Since there are so many physiological triggers for obstructive sleep apnea, pinning down what is specifically causing yours can be helpful. So, your sleep position is key. Additional weight is the usual focus since it affects things the most. \n\nIt's just a flaw in our throats. We have this gap that isn't naturally rigid, so if a force is put against it, it will collapse or weaken while we sleep, since it also wants to relax. So, you could just be unlucky and born with too large of a tongue for your mouth/jaw, or too large of adenoids and so on. No manner of weight loss is going to fix the obstructions, while any manner of weight gain will likely magnify the issue.",
            "In a lot of situations, there's no cure for obstructive sleep apnea. There's just steps in making it less bad.",
            "Because insurance companies won\u2019t cover things until they\u2019re being punched in the balls by papers like these.",
            "Yup. Lots of hypotheses stand to reason but we still need to collect the data",
            "doesnt matter how accessible it is when the company charges $1200 for one month supply",
            "But does it really make a difference if the conditions overlap? That is, Zepbound is already approved for obese people for weight loss. This new study says it can treat sleep apnea for obese people. But it does *not* say it can treat sleep apnea in non-obese people. So it would seem there are no other people the drug would actually be approved for.",
            "And more profits.",
            "I'm a bit overweight with apnea. Doctor told me losing weight would reduce episodes by X%. Sleeping sideways would cut another Y%. But my numbers were so high, even best case scenario reduction, my numbers would still be stupid high. Machine to the face it is no matter what. \n\nI'm still working on losing the weight. 15 pounds so far, but that one reason to do it I don't get.",
            "PSA: go get a sleep test and a CPAP if needed. It can be life changing. Also: untreated apnea is dangerous for you and others - falling asleep at the wheel of a car.is very, very bad.",
            "But not approving it for people increases the likelihood that the insurance company will have to pay for future surgeries (heart attack, stroke, etc) and rehabilitation (physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, etc) and dependency on numerous other medications. All of that cost is way more than 1200 per month. Add to that other medically costly conditions with a high co-occurrence with obesity (sleep apnea, dermatological issues, joint issues, and even things like hip and knee replacements) and 1200 seems like nothing! Don\u2019t get me wrong, the drug companies should lower cost, but it also doesn\u2019t make long term sense for the medical\nInsurance companies not to cover it",
            "Rich people get ozempic, poor people get body positivity.",
            "If you are obese but don\u2019t have diabetes you can only use the zepbound version that insurance won\u2019t cover because very few insurance plans cover health care for weight loss in any way. If you have sleep apnea though, you may be able to get it covered that way.",
            "Sounds like it wouldn\u2019t work for me then because being overweight isn\u2019t the issue. It will remain the breathing machine.",
            "I seem to be in this category too.\n\n\nThough score shows I get way more episodes sleeping on the left side then the right side.",
            "Untreated apnea can also kill you with a heart attack or stroke too. :(",
            "Thanks! I was just looking into it. I think I should get it looked at again and see if a CPAP would help me out.",
            "This is rubbish. Weight loss reduces sleep apnea, anti-diabetic drugs helps in weight loss. So, anti-diabetic drugs is helps reduce sleep apnea. This is like saying A=B, B=C, so A=C.",
            "Good explanation"
