            "Those last 5 seconds of the video get a little bit ominous.",
            "The tragedy of celebrity is so evident. \n\nMJ missing out on what should have been normal childhood experiences. Even if you don\u2019t celebrate a certain way, you would see the way friends and neighbours live.\n\nAnd, ET is so beautiful without makeup. So many women are, but are so used to the mask or don\u2019t feel \u201ccomplete\u201d without it. Such a tragedy and judgement on society.",

            "As far as I know, Elizabeth was only able to maintain a relationship with Michael & one of her exes. Both men spent as much time away from her as possible. There's a reason in her later years her ex was only willing to meet with her at a restaurant. She was an unpredictable, overbearing, extremely emotionally needy, the unhealthiest type of spontaneous, & entirely self-centered. This relationship with Michael was so incredibly toxic. A fantasy world for both of them; filled with manufactured love they couldn't get anywhere else because that kind of life theater is insane.",

            "Such a shame he was forced to be a JW by his parents. He missed out on so many beautiful experiences because of it. I'm not even Christian and I feel bad for him. I wish he had the inner strength to escape, but sadly he never did.",

            "What the actual fuck. I am 100% convinced he was a pedophile after seeing this video. The kid statues holding hands creating an archway for him to walkthrough. The way he was obsessed with \u201cSuper Soakers\u201d and said he loved them so much because \u201cif you come to Neverland you are bound to get wet\u201d. I\u2019m so disturbed.",
            "Does anyone find it strange that Michael Jackson is still generally publicly accepted even though he was a pedophile and molested kids?  No one else involved in sexual misconduct shared the same good fortune in the eyes of public opinion, yet his reputation wasn't irreparably destroyed.",

            "Smells like MK Ultra",
            "Had no idea that he was JW. That explains further why he was so strange.  Also, he was most likely a victim of pedophilia and why the allegations of him being a child abuser. Hurt people hurt people.",

            "If anyone would understand a stolen childhood and scrutinised life, it would be Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nThis is sweet of her to show him what the day is about for many.",

            "He's one of the few people I feel is a genuine case for potentially being a pedophile but not a \"predator\" if that makes sense. He genuinely seemed mentally stuck as a child and the more you learn about him the more concrete his lack of mental development is. \n\nDude was so fucked up and surrounded by sycophants his whole life. The stories of his medical treatments over the years and cosmetic surgeries are so insane. Soon as the doctor ran out of money they'd be back to convince him he had some new issue. He was taking up to 40 xanax pills every night all the way back in 2005.",
            "I watched this without sound. Probably because I can\u2019t hear well\u2026 \n\nThis video made me sad and happy. I\u2019m sad because he never really had a Christmas\u2026 even the broke ass, poor as hell Christmas situations I grew up in. But, what I saw was genuine joy. I was sad because he never had it, but elated because he finally got it. \n\nI could never imagine walking a mile in his shoes\u2026 but I can feel the joy that he had in that moment.",

But I\u2019m not fine with that.\n\nI\u2019ve never celebrated Christmas. Halloween. Easter. Valentine\u2019s Day. Thanksgiving. My birthday, or anyone\u2019s birthday in fact.

Humans are tribal by nature, too, and these folks end up isolated and unable to share even the most basic of interpersonal relationships because of the pedestal they're put up on.

Life in a  cult known to be as abusive as Jehovah's Witnesses can have that effect. But rather than break the cycle he just ended up perpetuating the abuse with unnecessary surgeries and multiple drug addictions. He was either utterly completely broken as a human being, or he never had the intrinsic strength to fight against it. Either way, he's a tragic figure more than anything.",
