Employee will follow best practices for transparency and collaboration, including but not limited to using standard variable names and aliases in code. Evidence for this will be 360\u00b0 feedback from colleagues as well as a weekly review of randomly selected code samples by line manager.\n\n2. Employee will respond to feedback from line manager in a constructive way, demonstrating targeted improvements to working practices as highlighted and documented in 1:1 meetings. For duration of PIP all feedback will be logged as SMART targets in HR platform and progress will be reviewed weekly.\n\n3. Employee will proactively resolve issues highlighted in his code by colleagues, rather than make suggestions for how others could step in to fix these issues for him. These issues will be collected in 360\u00b0 feedback and evidence of proactive resolutions will be requested from employee in weekly 1:1 meeting.\n\nSUPPORT OFFERED TO EMPLOYEE\n\nEmployee has been made aware of HR counselling and mental health services.\n\nEmployee has been offered additional opportunities to shadow colleagues to observe their practices\n\nEmployee has been requested to complete linked MOOC course on best practices for collaboration in a technical environment to ensure fullest understanding of colleagues' expectations.\n\nA letter has been sent by registered post with all information in this plan.\n\nEmployee will have benefit of recourse to union or other requested representation in all formal meetings related to PIP outcomes.\n\nOUTCOMES\n\nFailure to achieve objectives will result in a stage 1 disciplinary and a second PIP. Should that second PIP fail to achieve a satisfactory outcome in view of line manager, a tribunal will be called. Employee will be permitted representation at this tribunal. The outcomes of this tribunal may include successful completion of the PIP, a repeat of the PIP, a stage 2 disciplinary or termination of employment."
