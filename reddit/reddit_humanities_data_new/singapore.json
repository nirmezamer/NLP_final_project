Bus not showing up on time. Power cuts when assignments are due (no internet, even if you have an inverter or generator). People not being trustworthy / honest. The system being corrupt and slow, you can rely on institutions to make things fair. Plans will need to be changed on the fly, and you\u2019ll need to be able to make decisions in a chaotic environment and make peace with failures where your decision doskt pan out.  \n  \n\u2014-  sg story \u2014-   \n  \nTalking about SG, things are very predictable. Where grievances exist, redressal is swift and for the most part empathetic and fair.   \n  \nThe hard part in Singapore is keeping up with inflation and getting priced out by affluent immigrants or younger generations. I don\u2019t think the OP has experienced this side of things, given his demographic and age group.   \n  \nSingaporeans aren\u2019t soft. I\u2019ve met cabbies who told me stories of first gen Phillips manufacturing that moved to second gen silicon chip manufacturing to precision engineering and later services economy. People have reinvented themselves to keep up, and that not easy.   \n  \nThe kids here are awesome, so let\u2019s hope our future is bright and doesn\u2019t need to second guess how we stack up against other kids from other countries.  \n  \nI can see the MOE trying to make the learning / education a bit content agnostic and inculcate a learning / growth mindset to keep them from becoming stuck over the years, and even hdb making riskier playgrounds to prevent kids from becoming risk averse. We learn and we adapt, and we\u2019re fine so long as we don\u2019t think we have nothing more to learn.    \n  \n\u2014\u2014 so how?   \n  \nI respect the OPs sentiments and maybe interpret it as a case of, \u201che\u2019s trying to give his kids more exposure\u201d.   \n  \nBut rest assured that he\u2019s not taking a dig at SG - just wondering if his kids can adapt to global conditions if they aren\u2019t citizens and have the support of the local system.",
            "Am currently in Perth for work and have discovered Singapore is kind of living in a bubble. We're insulated from a lot of global issues. A lot of what we take for granted, like the low crime rate, safety and lack of drugs are just things people get used to over here. Not to mention rampant cults, crazy people, homeless... lots of things really.\n\n\nOn the flip side, it is really odd how easy it is to get used to it. I have been here about a year and frankly the difference in crime rates and safety are just things you learn some common sense about and avoid. I walk past Falun Gong and Jehovah's Witnesses recruiters and homeless every day.

So why trust a doctor who doesn't get enough sleep?",

There are so many deep-seated issues that sometimes I\u2019ve considered switching to GP work, but I\u2019ve chosen to stay.\n\nThe article is well-written, but I find the suggestion to lengthen the duration of conditional registration troubling. It feels like asking local graduates to extend their bonds even longer, which doesn\u2019t address the root problems. It\u2019s like treating sepsis with paracetamol without antibiotics \u2013 it misses the underlying cause. The real issue is that junior doctors are overworked, underpaid, and lack control over their lives, which drives many to leave.\n\nI often wish for significant improvements in the MOPEX system (the junior doctor work rostering system). Introducing differential pay for different postings sounds promising, but it raises questions: How do we decide which specialty is a \u201chardship\u201d posting? If renal medicine is considered difficult, what about cardiology or oncology? And if vascular surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and neurosurgery are challenging, is general surgery really that much easier?\n\nUltimately, it depends on how much MOHH is willing to improve the system. Ideally, though it might be a long shot, we could implement a bidding system where junior doctors bid for their postings. Popular postings could come with lower pay, while less popular ones offer higher pay. For example, starting with a $1000 \u201cenhancement bonus\u201d and bidding down to $0 \u2013 those who really want a popular posting like Comm Hos might bid low, and the department would then choose from the lowest bidders.

            ">Ultimately, it depends on how much MOHH is willing to improve the system. Ideally, though it might be a long shot, we could implement a bidding system where junior doctors bid for their postings. Popular postings could come with lower pay, while less popular ones offer higher pay. For example, starting with a $1000 \u201cenhancement bonus\u201d and bidding down to $0 \u2013 those who really want a popular posting like Comm Hos might bid low, and the department would then choose from the lowest bidders. If no one bids for a tough specialty like cardiothoracic surgery, those doctors would get an extra $1000.\n\nPeople will sure bitch about how this is immoral. There are many holier than thou types in the community.",
