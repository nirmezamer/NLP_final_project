So for the last world cup we had all participating countries (plus China) with at least banners, and for the euros with way less participants we get selected countries (including Wales who isnt even part of this years tournament). Just because its limited to Adidas.\n\nHoped to see stuff for Albania, Slovenia, Georgia, Turkey, etc.",

            "I live the implication that Psyonix hasn\u2019t always been this. Remember when events used to be free items + literal slot machines that you had to pay to open? Now it\u2019s free items and posted item shop items. Oh, the horror. \n\nPeople have such odd nostalgia for past RL events. They\u2019ve always been this way but worse lol. Free items (used to be you earned currency to \u2018buy\u2019 them, now you earn them through challenges), paid items (used to be crates, now it\u2019s item shop), and sometimes rotating LTMs. Even the one that the community claims to love (that several weeks long \u201cthrowback\u201d event with ghostbusters theme and whatnot) was the same thing\u2026 just had a cool theme song instead.",

It's just often that they either only ever free play free style and therefore absolutely suck at defending or just generally lack awareness of positioning getting into uncomfortable positions where most anybody below SSR tends to look goofy, and panic (as here 2 goals down basically 1 minute left) causing brain to go brrrr. \n\nThat's why within two matches you can lose 0-6 with the other team prejumping full field passing plays by the end and then the next win 4-0 because their shots didn't hit, they got in their heads, you held them in defense where they're not nearly as confident etc. \n\nBut yes, high Diamond and Champ is full of people that are absolutely toxic yet think they're infallible. God forbid they ever see a replay from their teammate's perspective, their brain would explode from either the realization they make exactly the same dumb mistakes, which is why they're champs, or from failure to achieve the insane amount of cope and double standards required to come out of that still feeling they're better than everyone else.",

Great solo plays like flip resets and doubles basically never happen in champ, and when they do they\u2019re slow, readable, and easy to save. You\u2019re just repeating a common cliche shared by hard stuck low ranked players coping about their rank not really being that bad. \n\n Champ players and god awful. Terrible. Basically golds who move faster around the field just for the sake of being fast and not based on the unfolding play. inefficient movement wasting good positions and boost just to be fast. Giving the ball away at every opportunity. Diving in as last man for no reason. Braindead decision after braindead decision. It\u2019s amazing how easy it is to win in champ if you just follow a few basic game principles. It takes very little skill to be in champ\n\nAnd yes I\u2019m talking anywhere in champ.

            "It is hard to draw conclusions for exactly that reason but seeing how they uploaded the clip themselves and it shows them clearly missing an open net and taking it away from their teammate while trying to pass TWICE, I do think they were shitting on everyone involved, since it doesn't paint a good picture of anyone there. (Which is not a diss on anyone, situations like this happen all the time, this is just one of the few were it went on for a very long time).  \n\nAs for the 'okay,' that one's on the fence, it may be simple frustration about the 2 minute power play that resulted in 7 shots on goal for them but a goal for the other team, or it may be OP being a toxic shit putting the teammate down after their first decent touch of the entire clip when they didn't score a ball they couldn't possibly have reached without massively overcommitting beforehand. The FF seems quite logical 3 goals down less than 50 seconds to play after this sequence of events. It's extremely unlikely they come back after this and it would likely only serve to frustrate them both more, carrying over to their next games. I'm not a fan of early FFs but this seemed very appropriate to me. The 99 matches you go out feeling worse at 0:00 than right there at 0:46 definitely outweigh the 1 where you somehow turn it around and get a major boost from the achievement.",
            "Self awareness is unfortunately very rare in this game (though arguably it is anywhere on- and offline). I've also played in GC lobbies not sticking out some days while missing simple aerials on other days. Some people are definitely more consistent with a lower ceiling (which doesn't mean they can't raise/aren't raising that ceiling obviously) but whenever I see toxic fucks this is exactly what I think. You must be either a garbage human being or incredibly unaware to think a player as bad as you apparently perceive them to be being the same rank as you is some kind of affront to God.",

            "I can tell from personal experience that pretty much every single lobby in Champ has at least one player that reliably hits flip resets. Now that doesn't mean they're inherently productive, but most players, myself included, are not prepared to defend that very well at that level and so it is a powerful weapon. \n\nLike I said, there's no cope, I know GC is technically not that hard to reach, but my ability and time available to invest in it limit me to where it would be a great feat if I ever get there. Players in Champ are incredibly reliable when they're playing to their strengths, they're just usually pretty bad at defending, absolutely horrible at playing with a teammate, and panic very easily which brings them back to Plat level 'chase ball at all costs and smack as hard as I can.' It's also the fringe where players start taking it slower and not throwing the ball away at every touch but are very inconsistent with their soft touches while defenders still struggle with balls that are just yeeted at their net. Which in itself paints a clear picture of the skill level.\n\nWhat it isn't, though, is a constant slugfest of whiffing balls and empty net counters as in this video. This is an extreme example which is why it's gained so much traction. \n\nOversimplifying it one way helps just as much as the other way, which is none. Any rank up to lower end SSL can be exploited very easily if you have the means to. The problem is most people and players don't, hence the rank distribution as it currently is and has always been. Just because you can, doesn't mean everybody can.",

What is the point of flipping in a random direction after a fake kickoff\u2026 with 10 seconds left\u2026 just simply turn slightly to the side of the ball. Same result and you stay in the play.\n\nAt least get the full boost in mid and get ready for a pass if you\u2019re not going to demo.

To me the value is what you think their worth to yourself and I think holding onto the for a while might be the best option. The game is still being played and I think if it shuts down or if you wait for some of the kids who are playing it now to grow up and might value these more later than say what the current market thinks about them. That being said I would only post them for about 20% more than what you paid for them. Only cuz you do have to pay a sort of premium for getting them all at once. \n\nBut honestly put them in a box and put that box in your basement. Forget about them for about 5 years then pull them out. Collectors by that point might be more interested in them as stock will have most likely ceased to exist in stores and you might set off some nostalgia buyers when they see them then.",
