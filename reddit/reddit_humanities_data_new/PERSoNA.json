Please read through this post for some guidelines and feel free to use this for discussion or small questions.\n\n**Always make sure to mark your spoilers!**\n\n---\n\n#Spoilers\n\nI want to remind people on how spoilers will be treated since Persona 3 reload is a remake.\n\nAs per rule 2, there is no time limit to spoilers. Just because the game is old does not mean that you are allowed to openly spoil the game.\n\nSpoilers must be applied to new Reload content posts. This will be eased as we go along, but especially for people with early copies, we want to keep some surprises for returning players. Please be mindful.\n\nAt least until the game is actually out, anything that is endgame spoilers will be taken down, no matter if it is tagged or not.\n\n---\n\n#What Is Persona 3 Reload?\n\nPersona 3 Reload is a ground up remake of Persona 3's main campaign, *The Journey*.

            "Idk why but I find it really funny that no one has uploaded a full version of the new Changing Seasons ost simply because these games are so damn long that no one has reached the point where that song plays. Like I'm sure someone could just directly rip the files, but right now there are so few copies out that no one who could/would do that has the chance, so all the song uploads we're getting are just direct game audio that's recorded as someone plays the game.",
            "Playing this game again makes me realize the thing I like the most about Persona 3--every person in the game constantly updates their dialogue on at least a weekly basis, even random NPCs.  Heck, your dorm-mates often update theirs on a daily basis, and it provides such great development and worldbuilding. \n\nDo not get me wrong, I like 4 and 5 just fine, but I always disliked confining character development and meaningful character interactions to cutscenes and social links.",
            "Now that some people got the game early, I wonder how long it will take until we get the first 100% guide.",
            "My envy of those that got it early is deep and burning. I'm half tempted to check my Best Buy but I doubt big stores like that are crazy enough to break street date about two weeks early.\u00a0\n\n\nOn the other hand congrats, you lucky bastards.",
            "Music; I've only heard the full Color Your Night 2 times now but my god it is so good. I teared up, Lotus Juice cooked so hard with the second verse",
            "So. \nMitsuru has -kunda skills. Only Aki did before\n\nAki has shock boost. So from these two we can see that the team members are redesigned for battle\n\nEiha and Kouha are in. Maybe Ken and Koro see some actual play\n\nA few new personas. So compendium is updated. Anyone seen Yoshitsune?\n\nExcited to build me some game-breaking Personas\n\nEdit: new moves - Multi Target Boost, Anti-Fire Master, and (new to P3) heat riser",
            "Noteable buffs and nerfs I've found so far:\n\nAkihiko lost Rakunda and Sukunda. Gained Shock Boost, Gigantic Fist, Tarukaja, and Sukukaja. Overall he got nerfed.\n\nMitsuru got Rakunda, some slash attacks, and lost healing. Overall she got buffed.\n\nAigis starts with Arrow Rain and Swift Strike. Gets Myriad Arrows and Diarama now. Marakukaja and Matarukaja come way earlier. Seems to have lost Sukukaja and Masukukaja. Overall she got buffed.\n\nKen gets Mediarama earlier ala Portable. Has the Kouha line instead of Hama now. Gets Makarakarn, Tetrakarn, and Dekaja now. Note that the reflectors are single target now. Overall, buffed super hard he's looking real good now.\n\nI have not seen any gameplay for Junpei and Koro so far, hopefully they got buffed but don't know.",
            "I love it so far I just don\u2019t like that it forces you to join the track team. I always chose kendo when I played the original",
            "I'm only 2 hours in and Allegra Clark is sooo good as Mitsuru (as expected) and so is Zeno Robinson as Junpei!",
            "Ok so some new leaked footage dropped and there has been a potentialy major change to social links: >!Chihiro's second rank social link scene was leaked and in it they added new story bits where they go into why she has a fear of men! She mentions that her dad was abusive and used to get angry at her which caused her to fear any other man afterwards. She also talks about one of her teachers that keeps hounding her with tasks, foreshadowing the stolen money plot line much earlier. I rewatched her og SL to make sure and NONE of that was in the game originally. This means that pre-existing social links are going to get new dialogue to help flesh them out. It's unclear how extensive these changes will go for every social link in the game but this is potentially a major change!!<",
            "Allegedly, Answer DLC coming within the fiscal year: https://twitter.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1752552368384704671\n\nDLC will be modelled after Lost Judgement's model. I haven't played that game, so no idea what that really means.",
            "why does every social link end with them running off to watch their show lmao",
            "Underated change: the character limit on your name seems to be longer, so I can actually fit my whole name in for once.",
            "Honestly shocked how much I love Akihiko\u2019s new VA. On 9/10 when he\u2019s yelling at Shinji and he\u2019s so damn good.",
            "Just started P3R, I got to the part where everyone (including the chairman!) is watching Makoto sleep in case he shows powers or whatever.\n\nAll I could think was, what if he started massively jacking off?",
            "Ugh they kept the whole \"being a yesman enabler\" SL with Magician and Chariot, gonna guess it'll be the same w Emperor, Moon, and Hanged\n\n\nI was hoping they could improve them like they made SEES more cordial so the gang can feel like they're closer than in the OGs",
            "Tartarus: I like it\n- goodbye stupid pick a card game!\n\n-Junpei: omg they struck gold with this voice actor......\n\n\nI love commenting on stuff possibly no one cares about: the car traffic in the back ground or outside the dorm windows......\n\n-so many vending machines you can actually use and by SP items in!!\n\n-going out at night: do I remember correctly that once you left the dorm you couldn't return without time passing? Well that's been changed thankfully.\nSame with entering and leaving your room. This sooo much better.\n\n-You can go to Iwatodai Strip Mall at night now?\n-There are part time jobs now???\n\n-That nighttime theme outside is excellent!\n-neat trivia: the crane game plays the theme of the pharmacies in Persona 1 and 2. What a neat reference.\n\n\nThis is an excellent remake so far. Are Atlus trying to blow FES out of the water??",
            "Can someone who got an early shipment of the game confirm whether you have to Max Stats to start Fuuka / Yukari / Mitsuru social link? Or have they relaxed that requirement",
            "Having all the social links voiced makes the experience so much better. I know most of the plot points for the story of p3 from the movies and stuff but I never played the game so the social links are all new to me. \n\nI can see why people hate Tartarus though, it\u2019s pretty mindless. Only made worse if you\u2019re going to this game after playing persona 5 or even 4",
            "I just finished the game. It was about as close to a perfect remake as I could have asked for. Every emotional scene hit just as hard and it was even more fun to play. I\u2019m so blessed to have one of my favorite games of all time be remade and it actually be quality. I\u2019m gonna lie down for a bit now.",
            "It seems likely that P3R is going to get the same treatment as P5 Tactica and get released at the same time it hits 2/02 0:00 in Japan. Which would mean 7:00 AM PST for me. Now the question is, do I take another PTO this Thursday and cancel dinner plans.",
            "I finally listened to the new battle theme. I can't believe I was missing this in my life",
            "One thing I'm liking about this game is how money seems to be pretty precious. In P5R I felt like I was literally dripping in cash and stuff like paying for the subway was just something added on for immersion and I was constantly spending big to get my stats up and getting better gear with barely any consequences\n\nIn this, I can barely afford to even get good gear for the MC and I really like that. Makes me think twice about going to the burger place for example to get my stats up but when I have the spare cash it felt like a good investment still compared to the free options",
            "Home stretch, boys and girls. Less  than a week.",
            "you can preload on steam now!",
            "The more goofy Lotus Juice verses a game has in it, the better it is. In the P3R remix of the dorm theme he freestyles about going to bed early, so it's instant GOTY material. \n\n'So dance, if you wanna go ahead, you're free to do whatever but I'm chillin in my bed.'",
            "Any word if Atlus has blocked scenes for people streaming natively on consoles?",
            "I literally went \u201cget in losers, it\u2019s Tartarus time\u201d and went from one border to another without a break. I\u2019m having an absolute blast with the game",
            "On the second study session, choose literature. \n\n >!Literally 1984!<",
            "I just lost 2 hours of progress to a crash that happened when I tried to summon Matador from my compendium. Just feels fitting to be honest, that fucker is screwing me over even outside of Nocturne.",
            "Just finished the game and I straight up ugly cried, man. What a fantastic game.",
            "[deleted]",
            "I\u2019ve been replaying the game on my Gf\u2019s PS5 and noticed something really cool with Aigis. \n\n>!If you do her dorm hangouts in January after her second awakening, her dialogue completely changes and she sounds more human. So cool that they thought of that detail.!<",
            "Was looking through the credits, I\u2019m sure some people won\u2019t be happy bc the VA casting has been controversial but it\u2019s pretty cool to see a lot of the original VA cast coming back in \u201colder\u201d roles. I put who I could find below.\n\n>! Yuri Lowenthal is Eiichiro Takeba !<\n\n>! Grant George is Takeharu Kirijo !<\n\n>! Liam O\u2019Brien is Kurosawa !<\n\n>! Michelle Ruff is Mayoidi Antiques Owner !<\n\nI guess you can include Tara Platt in OG cast too but it was already announced she kept Elizabeth haha.",
            "Why the hell does the \u201cshuffle time\u201d freeze happen before the character\u2019s splash screen? It completely kills the momentum, and it turns off the music! \n\nJust put the shuffle time after the splash screen. Let me rock out on my victory for literally one second, god damn\n\nThat being said, this game is absolutely stunning. The 3D character models are gorgeous, and the color palette in the environments is so beautiful (hello, cherry trees). Oh also the music is better too, IMO",
            "How is atlus with pc releases? Was considering getting this for the steamdeck.",
            "This is probably obvious but does reload use 3\u2019s shuffle time or does it happen to use goldens much better shuffle time \n\nHonestly golden is the only shuffle time I actually like as a mechanic",
            "I'm assuming not, but >!did they bring back the glitch where you can just skip the final boss by starting Tanaka's S-Link on the final day? If so that would be funny!<",
            "No swimming club? \ud83d\ude14",
            "Loving it, but is there really no swimming or Kendo team? I joined the Kendo team in FES, so that doesn't bother me *as much* but swimming? C'mon...",
            "Ok so this is my first experience with persona 3, I\u2019ve just gotten to 6/8 and I\u2019m 11 hours in but is the story supposed to be super slow? Or am I just being entitled? Cause compared to p4g, the story is a lot slower and p4g is a proper slow burn. I\u2019m enjoying the game a lot but I have no idea where the story is going",
            "I'm just very pleased with how good this game looks. It's so crisp and running so smoothly for me.",
            "Always wonder why am I still poor after hit tartarus for three nights... You don't get money for killing shadow",
            "Just finished Persona 3 for the first time as a persona player who played P5 and P4 before. Man the ending hit harder than the other 2 and I never thought I would bawl my eyes out that hard for it. I can see why that game is so Lauded for greatly.",
            "I'm still laughing at how different P3 is from 4 and 5 in respect to acquiring new party members. Like, Akihiko just found Junpei crying by himself and said to himself, \"he's got the potential\" XD",
            "amazing fusion accident yesterday: trying to fuse Slime using Tam Lin and Onmoraki and I got LOKI",
            "So how the writing for the new stuff for the male party and sterga I expect something great from royal team?",
            "Changed my game pass region on pc to new zealand hoping to play early lol",
            "Loving it so far, but why is the dialogue so quiet? Had to turn down the music a bit so I can hear the voices properly",
            "So does the shuffle not have sp recovery like in p4g?",
            "remember to watch the recordings in the command room !",
            "So... about social stats. I'm kinda confused about the musical note count. For example: the first wakatsu kitchen dish gives 2 musical notes, so i assumed that'd be 2 points in academics. Then, the second, secret menu dish also gives 2 notes but is locked behind charm lvl 2, specific week nights and is more expensive, so it stands to reason the rewards should be better. Finally, the academics arcade game also gives 2 notes while costing 3000 yen to play. So is that a visual bug and they give more than 2 points while only shopping 2 notes or does all of those activities only give 2 points? Iirc the only time i got 3 notes was during the cram session the night before the first exams",
            ">!Just finished the game about 30 minutes ago. Just as good as I remembered. Definitely cried again lol. I loved how they did the final choices, it made the ending so much more dramatic feeling if that was even possible. It was beautiful. Time to NG+ immediately!<",
            "Who was the unknown sender that sent the thank you message?",
            "Beat the game after 71 hours. Did all but 2 social links and did 95 quests.   \n\n\nDamn, what a ride it was. A true pleasure and probably the best way to play Persona 3.  \n\n\nI played FES before, so I had a particular enjoyment from comparing and contrasting the two games. While there are some parts where I think FES did things better, none of that takes away from how much fun I had in this game.  \n\n\nSimply superb.",
            "I just finished the game, never played any of the original versions (P5 was my first Persona game). And let me tell you... I absolutely loved it. \n\nSure, some things are a bit weird, like the overall vibe of the game being very gloomy and then the fight music kicking in with that ***baby baby baby baby*** was a bit weird to say the least. Music is still incredible, as usual though, so it's not that big of a deal. Tartarus is a bit of a grind and I missed the P5 palace structure, but the combat was still fun and I enjoyed my time with the game in general. Social links are hit or miss, but the good ones are ***very good***. \n\nAnd then... the ending. Spoilers from here on down: \n\n>!I had my suspicions when the seal attack cost Makoto's entire health pool... but that still didn't prepare me for how incredibly hard the last scene with Aegis on the roof hit me. And the previous day, going through town talking to all your links and hearing things like \"I need you in my life\" (yeah, Mitsuru was my romance, what can I tell ya). And understanding that all these promises will never be fulfilled because Makoto essentially had already sacrificed himself for everyone's future. Incredible ending, no notes.!<\n\nAll in all, easily one of the best jRPGs I've played, and while I still believe P5R is the better game overall, it's not really a fair competition with how much the series had progressed by then. \n\nNow, here's hoping for a P4 remaster just like this one... and if it doesn't come, I already have P4 golden loaded up on my steamdeck for my next new releases downtime.",
            "I just finished it. It's 5AM here and I'm bawling my eyes out.\n\n >!Unfortunately, this is my first playthrough of P3 and I have been spoiled about the outcome of the MC. But knowing it will happen just makes everything tug my heart.\n\n>!The last day of school talking with all your SLs and how they're doing, wishing to see each other soon and knowing what's coming.\n\n>!Also, the memory loss. That trope always kills me. Hearing Junpei trying to remember Chidori and remembering how she was waking up earlier.",
            "What the fuck why did I finish it today of all days I'm devastated",
            "Early into November, I finally entered into a relationship with Yukari!\n\nThe very next day, I hung out with Ryoji, where he was accosted by a group of guys furious that he\u2019d been hitting on all their girlfriends. We defused the situation, and afterwards he asked me if I was seeing anyone. Since we literally just made it official the day before, I told him yes, though I doubt Yukari would appreciate me spreading that around.\n\nAnyway, the scene played out as normal and the next day after that, there was a scene at the school gates where Yukari asked me about Ryoji. Whereupon he showed up and started hitting on her! I can only imagine the daggers my character was staring at him!\n\nThis was all scripted stuff that would happen regardless of who I was seeing, but the fact that these scenes happened so close together made it hilarious! I wish there had been different dialogue to acknowledge that he was hitting on my girlfriend who I just told him about, but I still love it for the organic comedy.",
            "Only complaint I have really is the intro and awakening scenes lacking the same style and emotional impact. I love the original opening to P3 where it constantly cut between the protag listening to Burn My Dread, shit hitting the fan, and chaotic train sounds. Total stylistic whiplash. And Thanatos ripping himself out of Orpheus and tearing the shadow apart with its bare hands while roaring like a t-rex was so cool. Here he just kind of pops out of Orpheus and slices the shadow with its swords.\n\nEverything else, I couldn't have asked for more so far.",
            "Honest question for those who have it: how would you say the voice acting holds up?\n\nI\u2019m planning on doing a shared run with my friend who I also played P5 with. He enjoyed it, but he hasn\u2019t played a Persona game since P5R 4 years ago. I\u2019m pretty worried about retaining both of our interest so I haven\u2019t ruled out just playing modded portable or fes instead.",

I don't mind the graphics being worse, I just want to keep the ball rolling once I finish this game with stuff that is just as entertaining and energentic:)",
            "Certified idiot here:\n\nIn the middle of August, I used the URL that unlocks the >!ambush!< skill and first thought to myself \"Damn, I shoulda used this earlier, I could have used that skill in the prior Tartarus run but oh well I'm just glad I found this now instead of late game only.\"\n\nThen when in Tartarus trying to figure out how the skill worked, it told me that I needed to \"Dash\" before it would take effect... and I had to scroll through the tutorial prompts figuring out what the hell that was and...--oh god you're telling me that I could have been running at P5 speeds? \n\nI could have cut some of my loot-only Tartarus runs in half? \n\nAnd I just accidentally mashed through the tutorial AND never noticed the prompt at the bottom of the screen telling me I could press R2 to dash?",
            "I don't get why they made Akhiko's Personality/Traits so buff focused when the only buff he gets is Sukukaja/Masukukaja, which doesn't really help him much. I also don't feel like his gauge goes up that much when I use one of those skills. Am I missing something?",

            "Spend 64 hours to clear my first playthrough for Persona 3 Reload. I want to share my opinions about the game.\n\nIs Persona 3 Reload a great game? Definitely\n\nIs Persona 3 Reload a great remake? Of Course\n\nIs Persona 3 Reload a great way to experience P3? Yes\n\nIs Persona 3 Reload better than FES & Portable? Yes & No. There are things in FES and Portable are better than Reload.\n\n**Story**\n\nMain story mostly retained the same from the original & FES while adding new story for Kirijo Group (via Memoir) & Strega. I like Atlus adding some scene for Strega, providing some background behind them which is quite nice. Definitely better than FES & Portable.\n\n**Cutscenes**\n\nWithout a doubt, FES anime cutscene are definitely better than Reload. The cinematography in FES are phenomenal. Don't trust me? You can just compare the cutscene from both version where MC is going to Tatsumi Port Island. I'll put the link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WBoL95xRdg).\n\n**Characters**\n\nJunpei gets the glow up in Reload more than in FES probably because of the Linked Episode & Hangout events. In FES he didn't hangout with MC much and he try to amend his relationship with MC by having a talk at the rooftop in January, however in Reload because you get to hangout with Junpei a lot so Atlus change the rooftop scene to reflect this. I already like Junpei's character in FES and Atlus adding so much stuff for him basically makes him even more like a bro. I love it and I love his New VA because his sounded like his voice never changed from FES.\n\nI have mixed reception for Yukari's new VA. On one hand she did good for some scene but on the other hand she also loses some Michelle Ruff's sassiness and because of that Reload Yukari feels less bitchy than in FES. I also felt that sometimes Heather's line delivery feels stiff and monotone? Overall it's not very deal-breaking but I still prefer Michelle Ruff's Yukari.\n\nAkihiko's new VA is other one I have mixed reception about. Same as Heather, Alejandro did good in some scene but did not deliver well in some aspect especially for the combat line. He did mention that Atlus specifically tell him not to imitate Liam o Brien's Akihiko but instead voice Akihiko with his take. And again not very deal-breaking but I definitely miss Liam's Akihiko, especially his \"I'm been waiting for this!\"\n\nMitsuru's new VA deliver her voice very well just like Junpei, although different voice but still managed to capture Mitsuru's trait. Atlus also add some stuff for Year 3 trio and I really like it. \n\nWhen it comes to Fuuka, any new VA will do much better job than her old VA but they will never capture her iconic robotic line \"IT HAS MULTIPLE WEAKNESSES\". NEVER\n\nKen, Shinji and Aigis new VA are mostly similar and they do their job very well. Koro-chan using JP VA no matter which language you choose.\n\nTakaya and Jin are much better in Reload than in FES. At least you can understand how Takaya really feel and his motivation behind his action when he interacts with MC alone at night. I like this new addition and hopefully we can see more about Kirijo group in The Answer DLC.\n\n**Soundtrack**\n\nBefore I criticize the reload version of old OST, I will say that all new OST addition are fantastic, Color Your Night, It's Going Down Now, Full Moon Full Life, Meaning of Armbands. With that out of the way, let's start this. Lotus Juice did his verse well but I can't share the same sentiment with Azumi Takahashi. It's clearly that most of P3's song are not suited to her style since she definitely better for jazz style music. I'm not very satisfied with her take on Mass Destruction, Shirakawa Boulevard's theme, especially Burn My Dread -last battle-. I was instantly turn off by her performance at final battle, I already knew she will never hit the same note as Yumi Kawamura but holy shit she somehow managed to make me felt even more disappointed. It's sad that Yumi Kawamura aging stops her from singing but it's even more sad when my favorite Persona soundtrack is delivered in mid. Despite all that, I did enjoy When the moon reaching out for the stars as the game progress, Changing Season (by far the only reload version better than original), Kimi no Kioku (still prefer Yumi's version btw.)\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nI have a lot to talk about the gameplay changes.\n\nSocial Link - Full voice acting is a great addition. Makes me appreciate them more than in FES and yes they somehow make Nozomi more bearable in Reload but I still prefer FeMC's Moon Social Link. Linked episode for males SEES member is great and I love it. They offer a different perspective and especially if you compared to FeMC's social link. The only thing I don't like is that you already have tons of social links to raise and they HAD to put Koro-chan's Linked episode after school but not at night. Because of this I can't maxed out all of my social links for my first playthrough.\n\nSkill Card - Now you can duplicate skill cards once per day instead of waiting for few days. Great changes especially for me and those who like to climb Tartarus once every month.\n\nActivities - Night life activities is definitely the one getting tons of QoL. Now you don't have to drink coffee to raise charm lol. Instead you have Iwatodai Strip Mall, where they provide better bonus than coffee and you can access to hidden menu once you eat a certain amount of times at certain restaurant. Hidden menu foods offers even higher social stats so you raise your social stats faster. Arcade still remains the same and still the way to farm social stats, but now you have option to choose.\n\nEquipment - In Reload you can't get weapons from normal chest or rare chest or Shuffle Time like in FES/Portable and you can only get them from specific chest at specific floors. Since you can't get equipment from chest like in FES/Portable, coin card and breakable objects are your only money farming options. You can spend your yen at Officer Kurosawa for better equipment but I rather save those money for social stats and fusing persona. For ultimate weapon, you no longer need to fuse Persona with Nihil weapon but you will still need those Persona for their heart item and then fuse it with Dead Moon Husk/Nihil weapon in order to get the Ultimate Weapon or Ultimate Armor. At least you won't need to spend a lot of money again except Messiah grinding.\n\nTartarus - IMO the real meat of Persona 3's gameplay since half of your gameplay was spent in this 265 floor tower. Healing clock was nerf because you have to spend Twilight Fragments to use it unlike in Portable. Accident days are no longer in Reload which is sad because I always go to Tartarus during accident days in Portable. To compensate that, they add fortune teller to increase rare enemy, strong enemy or weird enemy appear in Tartarus. You still get dark floor sometimes but the chances is really low. Floor interior design is better and they somehow make the disco block even more vibrant and colorful to the point my eyes hurt. Floor boss also reworked which is quite nice and I believe they have more floor boss in Reload compareed to FES/Portable. Monad Door is no longer an end game dungeon and was reworked into a Nihil weapon guaranteed place, Monad Passage on the other hand is a boss rush mini dungeon and get the key item to increase Major Arcana Card holding per day. \n\nSEES party member: MC/Yukari/Akihiko/Aigis (My main staple in FES/Portable and now in Reload as well)\n\nMC - Victory Cry was nerfed in Reload and only Orpheus Telos has it. RIP Beelzebub farming. Armageddon Theurgy is broken as fuck lol and Monad door is no longer an end game dungeon so Reaper is the only good option for leveling. Light and Dark now has damage spell instead of only instakill spell, SP management is harder compared to Portable but still manageable. At least the Invigorate 3 + Invigorate 2 accessory still stack. Oh yeah Odin's Thunder Reign is not as good as FES/Portable anymore so RIP.\n\nYukari - Previously she was a heal bot, now she has Amrita Shower and Masukunda and her 2nd Theurgy has party-wide Mind Charge. She can support the whole party well and dishes out decent wind damage and her high accuracy arrow shooting pierce damage (she won't miss anymore lol). I always bring her in FES & Portable and this will never change consider how much Atlus buff her kit.\n\nAkihiko - I can't believe they nerf him soooo much in Reload. RIP King of Debuff. His Masukunda was taken by Yukari and his Marakunda was taken by Mitsuru which left him with Matarunda. To compensate his nerf, they gave him Masukukaja???????? WTF ATLUS! Again RIP Kind of Debuff. Remember his Sonic Punch? Now he can upgrade his Sonic Punch to Gigantic Fist and God's Hand. His 2nd Theurgy hits super hard (omg) and because of his Theurgy Characteristics, he becomes a strong DPS in late game. Even though his DPS power gets so much buff but I still think Akihiko's overall kit is a nerf, especially if you view him as Debuff bot.\n\nAigis - She is more rebalance than buff/nerf. Her Masukukaja and God's Hand gave to Akihiko but she gets Primal Force in return. She still functions as good buff bot and now she can deal high damage with skill set and 2nd Theurgy.\n\nI want to start 2nd playthrough but college is about to start and I have to return to my dorm so I can't continue until May. Overall it's still a 10/10 game and 20/10 remake in my eyes. Reload is what a remake should be despite some of my nitpicking. Can't wait for Persona 2 duology remake. Feel free to discuss with me I want to hear other players opinion about the remake whether you are old fans or newer fans.",
            "First time finishing Persona 3 after I dropped FES a year ago 10 hours in because of the slow pacing. I don't think any Persona will end up beating P4G for me except a remake since that was my first Persona game, but I felt this was an overall much better experience than P5R. The cast is fantastic and I loved how much they had a life outside of the MC. Merciless difficulty was great as well. It made venturing into Tartarus an actual threat for the first half, although I ended up overpowering myself in the later parts. \n\nI wish they were a bit more ambitious with the changes because I can definitely feel that it was a remake of a 2006 game in some areas, but otherwise absolutely amazing 9/10 game.",

            "Well, I just finished the game. All in all, a pretty damn faithful remake of the original with some nice additions and added improvements. The gameplay and flow of the game certainly made it less of a chore to play and the added voice acting in damn near every scene made everything more enjoyable.\n\nHowever, aside from the few extra scenes here and there, it really was just the same story with a fresh coat of paint. I'm slightly sad about that, but I understand they wanted to be faithful to the original game. I did really like the linked episodes, though, especially the ones giving more backstory >!about Shinjiro, Akihiko and Mitsuru!< and >!really digging the knife in when you discover that Shinji was going to keep his promise and return to school to graduate!<.",

P3P was my first persona game and while I liked P4G and P5R, this one hits differently as they say.\n\nThe one thing I don't like though... the \"not social links\" social links. I feel like the game doesn't really communicate to you well enough that they're \"limited\" time events and that you need to do them all in order to get subsequent events. The game also doesn't keep track of them in any way for you (unlike the social links).\n\nAt the start I thought they were just party member stat events (since I think one of the first ones you do gives Junpei +3 to something) and I think I skipped one of Koromaru's but I have no clue! And I won't be able to do some of the summons now because of it.\n\nThe events themselves are actually great and give the characters some really nice additional character development. I just wish that a) they didn't lock Personas behind them and b) they made them easier to track.",

            "[deleted]",
            "Another update on my loving it/criticism seesaw of a journey with mostly the difficulty (or lack there of) and combat. I have beaten the game. Armageddon is as broken as ever with only the tiniest of nerfs in that you need to fill up the Theurgy Gauge. And I couldn't care less because I loved that thing, especially with the new animation. It's an end of game super skill that only really trivializes the Reaper, so it's fine.\u00a0\n\n\nThe final boss doesn't hit quite as well as in the original, but it's pretty much the same beat for beat so that might contribute (diminishing returns). No complaints, no real standout moment.\u00a0\n\n\nThe true ending however still hits as hard, and it was nice to see the final scene pre-rendered rather then in-game graphics like the original (iirc).\u00a0\n\n\nI have started and am decently into my MC Solo run. And so far it is not disappointing. The devs seem to have kept this possibility in mind by giving floor bosses patterns for which you can utilize changing Personas to combat effectively alone. I have not had to grind at all especially thanks to rare shadows.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nEven when I hit a minor wall that I was at first attempting to fuse a resistant Persona for, it turned out the boss was susceptible to mind ailments. It was then I learned how unbelievably broken poison is to anything it works on. Even with Auto-Tarukaja and already having a \"High\" tier PHY skill the boss took roughly 130 DMG. Once I poisoned it, it was taking 200+ DMG every turn and I didn't have to a darn thing but finish it a few turns later. It was similarly ridiculous against the block's \"tough\" red aura enemy.\u00a0\n\n\nAnother stand-out is Mind Drain finally feeling useful after half a dozen or more games being almost useless. When coupled with Drain Boost, it syphons 40 SP from enemies which at this stage is enough to basically run them dry. This makes it much safer to go for even against current floor enemies since they will often be out of SP. 40 SP in seconds that you also don't have to constantly go back to the first floor to use is much, much more tolerable.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSo yeah, let's see if this lasts. I am especially looking toward Monad mini-bosses, both the random and final floor variants, to see how manageable they are with the tools given. :)",
            "Finished the game last night after 134 hours!

At least four playthroughs between FES and portable, at least 90 hours each. I only did the intro through the attack on the dorm so far, but my notes:\n\nThe anime cutscenes are less stylized, and in my opinion a downgrade. There was this really cheap shot of the monorail going around a corner that was comically bad.\n\nTo make up for it, more of the cutscenes are in engine, and the in engine cutscenes are soooo much better in a number of ways. There\u2019s a lot more subtleties they\u2019ve managed to include above what was in the original animated cutscenes.\n\nThere\u2019s been some minor improvements to the script that make it feel less awkward.\n\nMusic is a lot crisper, no \u201cnew\u201d music yet which I was not expecting, just cleaner versions of the old music.\n\nVoice actors are nearly perfect, only one I have a problem with is akihiro who sounds too old\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of tweaks to UI animations that make things feel more coherent. There were several styles of pop in animation that have been switched to have similar acceleration curves as to what the UI had in the original. Not sure how I feel about this one, part of the reason for the incoherence was to give the visual novel style pop-ins feel more impactful, they could be awkward in some scenes, but the original game didn\u2019t use them too often outside the opening hour so\u2026.\n\nPeople have been ranting about the lighting online, and while I do think it looks a little off, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as bad as twitter is making it out to be.",

It suggests that Ikutsuki was using it as a means to store shadows that were to \"unique\" to release thus they set-up the \"Cathedral of Time\" as a means to keep them contained. What's really odd though is the memoirs found within the Monad passages seem to indicate someone else pulling the strings referring to Ikutsuki as a mere human but I don't think it's explain who/what this thing is or who left the memoirs behind.!<\n\n>!The game also never explains the note Takaya gives the protagonist. I'm assuming the idea was meant to expose Kirijo as the cause of Strega but if that's the case it goes absolutely nowhere because the protagonist does nothing with it. They also leave the origins of Theurgy open as well leaving an unfinished progress report within the story.

Combat has expanded a fair bit, it just does it through other means. From what I can tell, experimention through challenge runs could also be very rewarding. Since Royal, they tweaked a fair amount things just enough to perhaps balance things a bit better (again Royal is laughably easy) without removing their usefulness entirely.

            "Another Update, YAY! I may make a formal post with all my thoughts after all is said and done. \n\nI figured out why the final boss did not hit as hard, and it's probably the one aspect that is 100% inferior to the FES: the aesthetic tone and atmosphere are considerably different. It is just especially noticeable in the final battle. It is much too bright and the neon green aesthetic pales in comparison to the much darker, more monotone look of the OG. This makes such a large difference in how it is perceived. This coupled with cutscenes that are generally worse in direction makes it not quite hit as hard as it did.\n\nContinuing with the Solo run... my goodness how easy it is to just become so overpowered especially with using Theurgy. I lucked earlier into a mutated Ice Amp ability and when coupled with Ice Boost on a Persona using King and I it almost one shots floor bosses, random Monad door bosses and yes even the fixed Monad door bosses on final floors. With Concentrate, forget it. You are basically one shotting twice over, on freaking Merciless. I have now banned using Theurgy because there's just no point continuing without it. \n\nWhy Atlus doesn't take its most broken mechanics into consideration with their hardest difficulties I do not understand. There is nothing in the game to challenge optimal setups just as with Royal. It's such a huge disappointment since in general Reload is more difficult and better designed then Royal. It's just Theurgy when used to the best of your ability completely breaks every single fight.\n\nThankfully, full moon bosses still provide a decent challenge if not using Theurgy. Even as overleveled as I am from fighting rare Shadows whenever I see them (cause I figured you would need to overlevel with only 1/4 of your battle prowess), it still encourages fusing the right Persona with the right resistances and nulls since their damage output is rather high. I am however coming up on the probably two easiest fights in Hermit and Strength/(I forget) so we'll see.",

When attempted multiple times before I consistently got 2 or 3 mutations at best from a full roster of Persona as opposed to most fusions triggering one or more mutations consistently during that night.\u00a0\n\n\nCan also confirm skills can jump up at least 3 ranks IF the next tier skill is that high. I got Auto-Rakukaja and Auto-Tarukaja to mutate into their auto-Ma variants, which seems to be the preferred mutation (though I did get others with them). This is extremely useful for my party member only run as their damage and endurance are pitiful. Otherwise, the MC gets the self tri-auto skills before level 20 if you know which Personas have them and it only took a few save reloads to get them. So if you like railroading the whole game instead of just from about mid-point with a normal run, there you go lol.\u00a0",

            "I personally feel that, if Persona 4 had all of Persona 5's QoL improvements, then Persona 4 would be much better than Persona 5. The only thing I don't want to change (even though most consider it an improvement) is the dungeons. There's something charming to me about the randomly generated dungeons, and they're a lot less tedious to trek through than the Persona 5 palaces. But other than that, Persona 4 updated with all the Persona 5 features would be absolutely amazing.",
            "I just replayed P4 and it's shocking how well it still holds up, especially with the Steam release. I was a lot more negative on P4 but a replay has given me a new lease on it.",

            "+22 to all her stats with her best gun + Concentrate + Atomic Flare is basically, well, a nuke, lol. I don't even like Makoto's character but she becomes the best stat-wise by far. Salvation is unneeded because ailments are rare and often are recovered by Harisen Recovery anyway and ailment curing items are incredibly cheap.\n\nEffective 86 Str, 87 Mag and Agility, and 83 Endurance means she beats out every other PT in like every stat and her biggest issue in vanilla (no access to Concentrate) has been fixed because of Jazz Jin.\n\nI don't see how I could view her as anything but the statistically best party member lol.\n\nEven if P5 didn't have the double stat bug, she'd still have extremely high stats with her +11 gun.",
            "I guess some people really find walking through hallways till they find stairs for 100 hours really interesting or something. Palaces are miles better",
            "Personally I think P5 has the best theme, story, and characters. But that's a subjective thing, remakes of 3 and 4 will update the QoL stuff to be on par with 5 so people who prefer those characters and stories will be happier with it than 5.",
            "84 Str is good but not enough considering Ryuji, Yusuke and Haru can reach 99 Str and can get Severe Physical Attacks, something Makoto cannot \n\n85 Mag is great but Ann can reach 99 Mag and learn Severe Fire Spell that can damage a whole area instead of single target. That makes huge difference in bosses like Maruki.\n\nStill her crit rate isn't high enough like Mona or Sumire to allow her to have extra turns\n\nAnd Salvation can be a life savior in dire situations, considering how rare is to find itens that can cure everything for everyone.\n\nMakoto indeed got the best ranged weapon in the game that gives huge Stat boost but individually she still falls behind the others.",
            "Makoto also reaches 99 in those stats: Orichalcum R gives +14 to all stats, leaving her with 99 Mag and room to spare, equaling damage with Ann and getting much easier technicals, if you really want to stat stack lol."

However, the Social Links characters except >!Isako Toriumi!< and Tanaka got recasted. For Metis in Japanese, this is the first time in 17 years, her VA unlike the others reprised her role since Metis was never in other games such as Q and Arena due to >!Metis merged back into Aigis at the end of The Answer which is two years before Arena!< and the Q games took place during the main story which is months before The Answer took place.\n\n>English is the only one that replaced characters\n\nYes. Sega wanted younger talents for the roles. The OG VAs (except Vic Mignogna and the original VAs of Ken and Fuuka) voiced minor characters as compensation.",

One will be the opening song, which will have a completely new animation produced for it. **The other will be the battle song for preemptive attacks. Both of these new songs are composed by Kozuka (Ryota Kozuka, Composer for the Atlus Sound Team)**. With vocals by Azumi Takahashi and rap by Lotus, these songs are quite good, so I hope you\u2019ll also look forward to them.\n\nShoji Meguro composed Mass Destruction, in this interview Wada says there's a battle theme composed by Ryota Kozuka, so yes there will be a new Ambush theme",

I know there\u2019s not a lot I can do, but it\u2019s still irritating to me.\n\nAt least the new cast does an amazing job and the old cast got to show up in some capacity. (Platt still being Elizabeth was great). I haven\u2019t played 4 ***yet*** and therefore don\u2019t know any cast member names save Yosuke and Yu, and I accept that P2\u2019s been recast (granted that was pretty justified, the IS cast voice acting *sucked* I\u2019m glad they got better actors.) but I hope P4\u2019s cast gets to keep their roles.",
            "What are the original VAs for Ken and Fuuka though?",

            ">I hope P4\u2019s cast gets to keep their roles.\n\nUnlikely. They will probably get recast since most of the VAs are already old by the time the remake get officially announced. Sega will want younger talents to be in the roles for long term.",
            "Their original VAs for Ken and Fuuka remained unknown as of today. Unlike Naoto's original VA, Anna Graves, who revealed her identity on 2018 (a decade after vanilla P4 was released), the two VAs never came forward to reveal their identity. Ken and Fuuka got new VAs, Wendee Lee and Cindy Robinson, in spin-off games effectively replaced their original VAs.",
