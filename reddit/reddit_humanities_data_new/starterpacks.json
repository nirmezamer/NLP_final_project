These posts are very niche, and possibly triggering for some people. We have amended our rules to include the ban of Therapy dump posts. Some examples of these are.\n\n\"Undiagnosed depression starterpack\"\n\"Depressive college semester starterpack\"\n\"Undiagnosed (Illness here) starterpack\"\n\"(Mental health diagnosis) starterpack\".\n\nThese posts often touch on sensitive topics which other may not wish to see.\n\nIf you are having mental health problems, its best to talk to a professional rather than take it out on r/starterpacks \n\n\n2nd type of posts that have been a problem here.\n\nVentPacks.\n \nThese posts are essentially rants from people after having a bad day which usually involves bigotry or the comment section divolges into bigotry.\n\nFor example these starterpacks go something like this.\n\n\n\"The guy she chose over you starterpack\"\n\"The teacher who failed you in science class\" (When its just an extremely niche starterpack that really only applies to OP)\n\n\n\nWe want r/starterpacks to be fun and engaging. We dont want to hurt peoples mental health and we don't want bigotry on our subreddit because it is not nice.\n\n\nHappy Starterpacking!",

This sounded really unhelpful, but I think the truth that they were avoiding telling me was \"you feel depressed because you're in a changing part of your life, the only solution for you is riding it out\". I can see why they didn't say that, it would have been an awful thing for me to hear at the time, but it was right. Therapy/antidepressants wouldn't have done anything for me, making sure I was looking after my body would.\n\nMeanwhile my dad has been seeing a therapist for a few years because of some real childhood shit, and that *has* been really good for him.",

            "I think there are plenty of brands that use regular looking people that I personally see everyday. There seems to be a pretty wide range based on the brand and where the brand is based and the price point.\n\nTypically American brands have the widest diversity in models based on price point. Like if you shop at Target all of the models come in the full spectrum of skin tones and body shapes. \n\nA step up from that at a store like Abercrombie and Fitch you still have a fair amount of size and ethnic diversity (for women, not so much for men), but admittedly most of the female models lean towards smaller sizes and the men are basically all athletic slim builds.\n\nA step up from there you have things like Banana Republic and Club Monaco which basically only have slim models for both men and women. Then at the upper tier of American Fashion like Tom Ford and Ralph Lauren which only have models that have the exact proportions of store mannequins. In Europe, regardless of price both the male and female models are skinny and aren\u2019t even usually headturners.\n\nI think that for the average person, with an average income, looking at stores like Abercrombie, H&M, Zara, Quince, etc. they luckily aren\u2019t usually seeing a totally unrealistic standard of beauty. I see dozens of people everyday single day on the metro to and from work, at work, or just out at restaurants that could convince me they were models somewhere like Target or H&M or Everlane. \n\nSure runway has a different standard, but that\u2019s not where they average person sees images of models, and even if they do there\u2019s still Precious Lee, Jill Kortleve, Paloma Elsesser and many other runway models that deviate from the standard and it\u2019s becoming more common",

            "Take this with a grain of salt, but I know a few models who all seemed to repeat similar things when asked - It depends.\n\nModels working in high fashion, or otherwise very \"artsy\" gigs are often chosen because of their ability to attract attention to themselves and a piece, rather than be just another attractive person in a huge list of attractive people. It was more important that you have something about your face, or stature, that made you stand out while fitting the piece well, while lighting, makeup, diet, exercise, ect... could do any heavy lifting needed to make you more pleasing to look at. The most consistent feature of many of them was being thin, though if I remember right some of it may have to do with it being easier to build an outfit outwards around a thin person if you need to make them appear larger, while it obviously isn't mechanically very easy to do the same in reverse with someone who is obese. Also, facial structure stands out less the heavier a person is.\n\nCommercial modeling is where you would(often, but not always) see more of the stereotypical supermodel style, because the goal there is to attract customers to existing brands by impressing them with a look that is comfortable and recognizable, yet taken the most extreme or sexualized in a way as to present the model as a \"best example\".\n\nNote, there were, and I presume still are, some views within the modeling industry that will color ideas of what the various subgroups are like, and I have no doubt it may have impacted this answer on account of myself not having a balanced slice to talk to. Some of it seems to make a bit of sense, the ones I knew weren't always the most attractive people in the room, but tended to have something about them that demanded attention regardless, even if they weren't \"your type\" regarding looks.",

Meth is an extremely addictive drug but it does not have the same physically addictive characteristics as opiates/benzos. When you stop taking meth you do not have a period of sickness and in general your body should physically feel better being off meth for 48 hours.

            "I think I gave a pretty good example as to why the distinction matters in determining if it negatively affects your life. If you\u2019re in chronic pain and plan to use opiates on a daily basis to control your pain then you will be an opiate addict. You will form a physical chemical addiction to the drug as your body will lose its sensitivity to natural opioids. You may make the informed decision that you\u2019re ok with that because you\u2019re getting your drugs from a pharmacy and won\u2019t run out and the pain relief is worth it. Because you\u2019re seeking pain relief and not the repetitive euphoria of opiate abuse, you will not be psychologically addicted. If you slowly taper down your dosage over time or switch to a drug like methadone you won\u2019t have cravings and constantly think about taking pills again. Someone who is psychologically addicted will be thinking about relapsing months or even years after they quit. Physical and psychological addictions are fundamentally different challenges and it is relevant to understand how these addictions are different when talking about weed. If you quit weed cold turkey after being an 8th a day smoker you will be mildly irritable, have trouble sleeping, and won\u2019t have much of an appetite. But you can conceivably overpower these feelings and go about your life. You cannot treat physical drug dependency the same way. Another example to look at is benzodiazepines. These are about as extreme as you can get when it comes to physical dependence because your body is now no longer capable of properly regulating brain activity without them. Someone with a strong tolerance to benzodiazepines physically cannot stop taking them without having a seizure. The fact that you need hospitalization to get sober from Xanax safely demonstrates the fundamental differences between physical and psychological addiction. You can spontaneously decide to get sober from weed without having to take several weeks off of life to go through withdrawals, you cannot do that with physically addictive drugs like fentanyl and Xanax.",

And i only threw out the shot because you used that as a way to put down other people. Thats why i thought it was funny. Just a tip though youd be better off getting a low end construction job, it would pay more and are fairly easy to get if you got good work ethic.",

He\u2019s got a nice little cot with a tiny refrigerator, little microwave, his laptop can connect, using many different Wi-Fi accounts that he\u2019s hacked into, he grabs occasional food in different areas, along with canned foods, and sodas, and he pretends that he is a student. He carries around a few textbooks that he\u2019s managed to get his hands on, and basically he audits classes, but it looks like he\u2019s attending them. He attends many different parties every week, getting plenty of free, beer and food, But auditing all those classes also is giving him basically a free education. He stays in that hidden space for about 10 years, people thinking that he\u2019s living in the dorms or off-campus or something like that, he lives quite the life, partying, and auditing classes, and getting more more educated, and then one day, he decides to CLEP a bunch of classes until he finally has a couple of masters degrees; armed with a good education, he gets an intern job at Google, or at least it looks like it. He uses all of their facilities, and sleeps in the googolplex, does his laundry there, eat all the free food, makes a lot of connections, eventually, he\u2019s able to finagle himself a real job there that pays real money; he buys a small car, moves it around the parking lot or parking garage, or whatever, so it doesn\u2019t get towed, saves up as money and invest it eventually and buying a small house far away from Google headquarters in an area of the country that\u2019s actually affordable.
