            "I'll give you a rundown of my career and how I got to where I am at today:\n\n* I got my associates degree in IT in Spring of 2016. Later that year in fall of 2016, I landed my first gig as a Service Desk Specialist for an Aerospace company. It was a pretty decent job and paid 17/hr starting out. I was still living at home at the time so I was able to save up alot money. I was doing menial stuff like resetting passwords, onboarding new people, setting up workstations, imaging computers, etc.\n* A year later in late 2017, I decided to move on - so I got a contract job at a well known credit card company refreshing computers. Well, it was really repetitive so I left. I was only there for 5 months.\n* January 2018, I landed a new role as an IT Specialist for a Credit Union. This is where I got the majority of my knowledge, I went from from being a help desk guy to a desktop admin, then almost a Junior Sysadmin. I was with the company for over six years. Things didn't go as planned, I was promised a sysadmin position but they never delivered so i left.\n* April 2024, I landed my first system admin position for a medium company that does federal contracting work. I do it all from working tickets, patching PCs, maintaining their cloud infrastructure, administer all the servers and virtual environment, dealing with SQL databases, and manage their network. Pretty much the whole nine yards.\n\nHere is what I can tell you from someone who's been in the field for about 9 years, you NEED to want it. You NEED to keep learning new technologies and stuff that is trending, go that extra mile at your current job and don't be afraid to have one on ones with your boss to see what you can help streamline and implement. Proactively study and document - and I can guarantee you it will help you in the long run. Trust me, I worked with people who've been in IT for 20+ years doing the same thing like helpdesk - because they do the bare minimum to get by. Don't be like this - you got to want it, own it, and CONQUER it!\n\nCongrats on the new gig by the way, I wish you the best of luck!",

If you are in the Helpdesk, it is crucial to progress quickly from L1-L2/L3 ASAP. When I took over and became the Sole Systems Admin on another company I am well-prepared to handle anything and everything. I think there is  just no way you can jump to Sysadmin as your first job because you need to rapidly assimilate and understand  the inside and out of your Company's current IT/Cloud Infrastructure, know how everything works in the backend, how everything is connected/integrated. What you think you need to improve on Systems/Processes. How you talk to user's in a technical way to explain things. How you explain things in  detail to your CxO boss.

Blew my mind, but I knew their contractor was getting paid more than that, so that\u2019s how they based my salary.\n\nI spent my next couple years learning, studying, and using Google to solve everything I could.

Thats the bottom line.  We have hired people with a similar track record, and it has never ended well.  Mainly because they don't know what they are breaking into.  We have had instances of infrastructure being taken down on accident because these no experience testers didn't know any better.

I also worked part-time help desk during that time for my local government. My I.T. section wanted to hire me full-time, but they implemented a hiring freeze due to a budget shortfall that they project will last a few years.
