Can't find the perfect survival sim or unsure which 1 RPG out of the thousands available you should buy? Well this is the thread for you. **This monthly megathread is meant to contain questions about what to play and suggestions to others on what to play**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow to make this work best and not just be spammed with \"What should I play?\", **please be in-depth in what type of games you are looking for, and when giving advice it would be appreciated if you're more detailed than \"I think X game is good\"**. There are too many games to be able to properly suggest something with no background information, like-wise commenting a game title and saying you like the game offers no actual value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main purpose of this thread is to contain questions on what to play and advice to others on what to play, but feel free to ask and discuss freely in the comments regarding games whether you want advice on what to play, want to give advice to others on what to play, share a hidden gem you found, discussions & questions about discounts, sales, events, or just general games discussion.",

            "I posted one already, so forgive me for posting again, but:\n\n  \nI want a game whose story will make me cry. It doesn't happen much, and it sometimes happens with weird stuff.\n\n  \nWhat Remains of Edith Finch made me cry. That one part of Final Fantasy XV made me cry (\"You guys are the best.\"). To the Moon. Maybe Life is Strange? I don't remember.  NieR: Automata made me cry over a robot with a bucket.\n\n  \nI teared up at the end of the Undertale (pacifist) from a combination of things: I knew it was made by just a few people, it seemed pretty tightly-made, it surprised me a bit, and it was a fun bit of...what do I call it? Neo-nostalgia? That.\n\n  \nI cried for a bit with Final Fantasy VII, back in 1997. Not so much the new stuff.\n\n  \n...hope that helps?",

Someone recommended me the quintessential quintuplets game and I really like the aspect of giving them tasks (time management) but don\u2019t necessarily want to play a dating sim. A lot of dating sims fall under this but I\u2019m looking for something more SFW. There are a couple others that sort of fit this description like the cafe simulators but I don\u2019t want to be on a real-time timer, I\u2019m looking for something slower paced.\n\nI guess the closest thing might be Life is Strange, but was wondering if there was anything out there that fits this description. Probably just a SFW visual novel that\u2019s more geared towards friendships rather than lovers?",

            "I have a specifc type of survival game I wanna play.\n\nI enjoy playing Rust, but I usually play PVE servers. I like the idea of being on a PVP server, but I'm not a fan of raiding. I like having a base that is \\*safe\\*. A place I can retreat where no one can get me or my things. I want to be scared of leaving the base, always having to look around for threats, but I always want the base itself to be a safe place, a hiding spot, a place where I know that if I get the loot inside nobody can get it. I only want the PVP to be outside the safety of the base.  \nI've been looking for a Rust server that has PVP (not just PVP zones but overall PVP) and no raiding, but it doesn't seem to be a popular demand, I'm just the oddball out there. So I was wondering if there's any game out there that fits my wishes maybe?",
            "LF a cozy farming/crafting sim or cozy collectathon without time mechanics. Crafting-centric would be cool!\n\nI love Stardew, but I HAD to use the time manipulation to stop time for each day.\n\nI have severe ADHD and time crunches only make me frustrated with the game. It doesn't become fun to me anymore. LF reccs similar to Stardew without these time mechs. Like Animal Crossing, Dragon Quest Builders, etc.\n\nSomething with a lot of crafting would be fun too!",
            "I\u2019m looking for a pair of games (or one game with vastly different gamemodes) where the actions taken in one game influence another. These game(modes) would be of completely different genres.\n\nExample 1: Game 1 could be a grand strategy/4X type game where gods or powerful mages shape the world and create/destroy/play out factions in a world, and create dungeons as a result of their actions. Game 2 would have players play an RPG style game, where they create their own characters and set out in the world shaped by Game 1.\n\nExample 2: Game 1 has players dive through history to change stories in a sort of word game where errors in text are present, but how they are allowed to correct them is significantly looser than correctly spelling the word, and could be rewriting entire sentences. Game 2 would be a town/cult manager where constantly shifting texts force players to adapt their faith to changing conditions, driven by players in Game 1 who are unaware and not intentionally malicious or beneficial to those in Game 2. The legacies left by the cults in Game 2 shape new stories for Game 1 players to engage with.\n\nThese game(s) would likely be real time and create an ever changing world/meta, but there could be delays in how actions from one game affect another (Perhaps the world/meta updates on Week 4/8/12 etc as a result of actions made by Game 1, while updates on Weeks 2/6/10 occur as a result of actions made by Game 2 leaking back into the gameplay of Game 1).",
            "I'm looking for a historical fiction game.\n\n  \nPreferably something that at least accurately portrays the history surrounding it, even if the narrative itself is made-up. Like the Titanic movie or something.\n\n  \nI'm open to visual novels, especially if they're free or inexpensive, but they're far from my favorite genre. I sometimes play them to sleep like I read to sleep. I imagine there's decent stuff out there, nevertheless, so if that's what you have to recommend, I'm at least up for taking a look!",

            "I assume you've played Fallout 76? I was reluctant, but it's pretty fun and they've found a good MMO/RPG balance. (I've never experienced griefing, and in fact other players are very nice + helpful.) \n\nThe \"Mistress of Mystery\" story line is Top 5 Fallout story lines. Seriously \u2014 it's up there with \"One for My Baby\" in FNV.\n\nMeanwhile, you might want to try the Once Human demo. It's kinda like Rust + F.E.A.R. Loads of PVE content. I started up the demo and skipped the weird cutscenes and got started playing the actual game and next thing I knew, four hours had passed. I don't know if you like survival stuff, but if you enjoyed the Settlements in Fallout 4, you might like this. It is 3rd person, but it's really well made IMO.\n\nUnfortunately, the open world RPG stuff like Fallout + Far Cry (less an RPG, but still) require so many resources that it's really hard + unlikely that a smaller developer will be able to pull one off. (Ain't so many Concerned Apes out there, heh.) Most of the ones being made today are turned into MMOs (Lost Ark, New World, BDO, even Palia), which bring their own negatives. For me it's the loot spam. So much crap to sort through all the time!\n\nI hesitate to bring this up on r/Steam, but if you can afford GamePass, it's a good way to access a lot of games. Palworld is on there now, and it's a pretty enjoyable time sink. (Again, 3rd person .. but it ticks some boxes.)\n\nGood luck!",

            "Some games you might want to put on a wishlist. They're not cheap, but they tend to appeal to people who haven't played a lot of games and aren't ready for Minecraft or Stardew Valley:\n\n* **Peggle** is kind of the next evolution of Snood. Instead of firing things up, you're dropping balls down into a screen kinda like Plinko on *The Price is Right* (maybe she knows that game from TV?) .. and the pegs disappear when the ball hits 'em. There's a free demo and the full \"Peggle Deluxe\" game is just $5..\n* **Unpacking** is a very chill game where you unpack boxes after someone has moved. Over the course of about six moves, you learn about this person's life. \n* **A Little to the Left** is about sorting things.. sometimes it's small to large.. other times it's color patterns or whatnot. I found it a little infuriating, but some people really like it.\n* **Dreamlight Valley** is a town builder game featuring Disney characters.. Is she into Disney? If so, the game is designed for kids and very user-friendly.. therefore depending on how much she enjoys Disney stuff (some people are *really* into it), she might enjoy it because of that.. It's not an amazing game, but if they ever made a clone with *The Simpsons* I would play it forever!\n* **Palia** is a free to play MMO-ish building and survival game with minimal combat.. it might be a little complicated for her, but the price is right.\n\nGood luck!",
            "> Ruins to Fortress\n\nThis looks interesting. I'm not crazy about 2D survival games (although I loved **Starbound**) and not into PVP survival at all.. but I see there is a PVE mode so I'll give it a whirl. Thanks for the recommendation.\n\nMy standout was **Once Human**.. It's kinda like Rust + F.E.A.R. Loads of PVE content. I started up the demo and skipped the weird cutscenes and got started playing the actual game and next thing I knew, four hours had passed. Then I played for another 4 hours.\n\nI actually forced myself to *stop* playing, because progress will be wiped when the game drops in three weeks. I haven't been this excited for a game in years. \n\nApparently it's going to be F2P, making money through cosmetic stuff. Honestly? I plan to buy some stuff just to thank the developer for making such an excellent game. Even if they do something awful with servers or whatever, I've gotten 8 hours of pure joy already. That's not something I can say about every game I buy for $30, much less all the time I've spent on mediocre demos in recent years. \n\nSo yeah. **Once Human**. Weird custscenes, a story that takes itself a little too seriously, but aawweessoommee survival gameplay + combat in a deep world with loads of quests and activities.",

            "The \"free\" part is tripping me up. Most of the free games these days are MMOs that hook users with endless loot and mechanics that go very deep, so that you keep coming back again and again. \n\n**Path of Exile** might fit your bill. It's not really open world \u2014 more of a Diablo clone \u2014 but it's pretty simple combat (click on what you want to kill) and it's free.\n\n**Lost Ark** might also suit you. Pretty similar game to PoE but more polished. Loads of loot spam tho; that's why I quit playing it.\n\nI loved the demo for **Once Human**, and combat is pretty basic.. but the inventory and building and crafting mechanics are a little complex.\n\nGood luck!",
            "First thing that came to mind for me is the early access title [Crypterion.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1048860/Crypterion/) It describes itself as a mix of visual novel and business tycoon. Haven't gotten around to it yet so can't comment on how exactly the management part plays though.",
            "You might check out **Eliza**.. It's made by Zachtronics, who produce some excellent titles. I didn't love Eliza, but I recognize the interesting bits in it. It's a visual novel about technology and human relationships, and the title derives from one of the first ever chatbots (mid 1960s) which took the form of a virtual therapist. So the game Eliza is focused on helping people in a therapy situation, and then talking to friends and co-workers. No real romance to speak of that I can recall.\n\nAfter playing Eliza, I decided Visual Novels just weren't for me, but I do consider it a kind of gold standard for the genre. Find it on sale perhaps.\n\nGood luck.",

Everything is up-to-date and Steam game streaming works perfectly from this PC to my Apple TV. There are no controllers attached to this PC. I use the included compatibility tools to play Windows games no problem.\n\n**The Problem**\n\nWhen I go to stream a non-Steam game installed through Heroic or Lutris, the controller doesn't seem to leave Steam. Every controller input makes the Steam UI react in the background and I can't seem to focus the game. I have tried using AnyDesk to investigate while the game is running, alt+tab to switch, etc, but the controller stays stuck to Steam!\n\nThe same problem occurs if I stream to my Steam Deck or MacBook so I don't think the ATV is the cause.\n\n**Details**\n\nI have some games with Epic Games and GOG as well and I'd like to play them using Steam Link. First, I tried Dragon Age: Inquisition. Here's what I did:\n\n1. Install the game via Lutris.\n2. Run the game locally in Lutris and confirm it works.\n3. Add a Steam shortcut from Lutris and restart Steam.\n4. Run this Steam shortcut locally and confirm it works.\n5. Run this shortcut on my ATV.\n6. Run Lutris as a Steam shortcut and try to launch that way.\n\nI've repeated the above with Heroic as well and gotten the same result.

I've done this several times by now, and leaving it a day to download resolved the problem without further action.\n\n  \nThis same situation happened around a week or two ago, so I did the usual-try to download the missing files, steam says some shit got corrupted, I uninstall, and I reinstall. Two days ago, after downloading the main game I had to download around 122GB of mods. Once the download was finished, I closed Steam, shut off my PC and went to sleep.\n\n  \nYesterday comes, I boot up my computer to do the last assignment of the course, and check whether HoI IV is ready to be run for the night, when I would host an MP game with friends. Turns out, Steam takes about two entire hours to actually open. Things aren't better when it finally does, since it is laggy as hell and it freezes several times. I somehow manage to stand by long enough for the library to open, and once it does, I run HoI4-surprisingly it goes smoothly; all my mods are there and the game itself runs just fine.\n\nAfter closing the game I try to delete the download cache, and I manage to. However, during the process, I remember seeing a brief popoup saying 'cleaning unsuccesful' or something along the lines of that, before it closed itself. Steam was as just as slow, if not even more. I did it again-this time there was no popup, but it didn't solve the problem.\n\nToday I tried reinstalling, but now it doesn't even log on. It just stays loading user data indefinitely.

            "Hello, I have a problem with my Steam games. My ping normally varies from 1 to 30 and 80ms, according to the servers in my region. However, a few weeks ago, when I'm in a match, my ping spikes to 183ms and stays static there until I leave the match and reconnect (which is annoying).\n\nI've contacted my ISP, and they informed me that my connection has remained stable, which is true because I've been monitoring it.\n\nThis problem seems to only affect my Steam games (such as TF2 and Dota 2). I've downloaded and installed Fortnite and LoL, and while having these games open in windowed mode with Dota 2 also running, I see that the problem only occurs in Dota 2/TF2.\n\nI've opened all ports on my router to my computer using the \"DMZ Function\" feature that my router has, so I don't think it's a port problem. Plus, my Dota 2 and TF2 were working fine without this function.\n\nInterestingly, this problem arose in the last week of May, and coincidentally, Steam updated that week. Maybe it's a problem with the Steam version and my computer/network.\n\nI'm not sure what other information to provide, so I'm attaching screenshots of the tests I've done.\n\nI hope you can help me, thank you.\n\nimages: [https://imgur.com/a/VIIymYz](https://imgur.com/a/VIIymYz)",

Steam Support tends to be fast with refunds requests (their [stats page](https://store.steampowered.com/stats/support/) shows a maximum of 1,5 hours). So you don't have to worry about submitting a refund request, because it's going to be quick - there are 7 days remaining with the sale of Hogwarts Legacy, so that is more than enough time.\n\n>Okay I just read that it can take up to a week?\n\nThere are [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/anxk64/refund_pending_how_long/) from other people that the \"pending\" process tends to be 24 hours only. But as you intend to make another purchase, make sure you pick the option to refund the funds to your Steam Wallet ([official screenshot](https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/help/images/faq/refunds/5Refund_requestForm.png)), as refunding the money back to your original payment method can indeed take longer.

In a nutshell, you have likely gifted more games than you bought for yourself, and now Steam has restricted your Steam wallet funds. In order to solve this, you have two choices:\n\n1. Use a different payment method and do not use existing Steam wallet funds for your gift purchase. If you are restricted to use Steam wallet funds for gifting purposes, the purchase will succeed when you use external funds.\n2. Create a Steam Support ticket in the appropriate category, and do *not* spam them. The correct category for this scenario is \"Purchases\" and \"I can't complete my purchase on the Steam Store\". Describe what happened in detail, including a copy of the error text or (even better) a screenshot of the error. Then wait for their response. Steam Support will then likely either fix this error for you, or they tell you that your account has a general gifting restriction and that they won't lift it. Unfortunately it's not known what factors Steam Support uses for their decision.\n\nWhen all fails, you can also use trusted sites like Humblebundle to buy a Steam copy of Deep Rock Galactic.

For example, the setting of \"Earth\" has a complex and ever shifting geopolitical landscape that the inhabitants, \"humans\" were routinely caught up in across this span of time and the resulting conflicts have proven fertile ground for the Call of Duty games as \"humans\" were known to enjoy shooting each other with projectile weapons and in fact based many of their religions around this activity and incorporated it into their education and leisure times.\n\nThe newest forthcoming game in the Call of Duty franchise takes place during the final hours of human history, 1991 C.E. (Common Era for the casuals) a time of great peril as the super power known as \"USSR\" has suddenly collapsed due to pressing economic factors leaving its rival \"America\" to clean up the mess left in the wake of collapsing alliances. The end of the \"Cold War\" and beginning of the \"First Gulf War\" see the total victory of \"America\" coming to full fruition. As game designer Francis Fukuyama said \"history has ended\" when making the announcement that the \"Second Gulf War\" would be the final installment of the series.\n\nFans are heavily divided on Dr. Fukuyama's comments, even more divisive was the decision to have the setting end abruptly in 2012 via failure to renew the \"Mayan Long Count\" a not well liked and poorly understood method of maintaining a subscription service to the servers the simulation was running on",

I still don't get it, to be honest. I don't think the writing is *bad* but I truly don't think it's any higher caliber than something like Jack Ryan at its absolute peak. And IMO it doesn't really *need* to be for the kind of game that it is.",

A decent playable Hollywood film.\n\nAnd Black Ops come here too (with exeption for four because no story mode bruh, and Cold War because i didn't play it) for obvious reasons, they are just nicely written. Even the third one, while being flawed to say the least gets bonus points in my book for effort and utter brainfuck what was a new thing for CoD.\n\nFor a \"couch game\" CoD has surprisingly lots to bring.",
            "Indeed, not anymore. But it took 10 years for the campaigns to stop being the selling point (or even a selling point) and they've tried to bring that aspect back multiple times, well at least in the marketing. So I'd say more than half of the franchise is or at least tries to be story rich.\n\nThe fact that it is known for the xbro multiplayer doesn't take away that aspect of the games.",

They're reasonably short, so could be a good filler between longer titles.",
            "Reznov and the World at War stuff is cool, but man the og COD WW2 campaign is goated. Only thing is all the tanks being Pz2's, maybe there is a mod cause all the tank types in COD3 campaign were sick.",

            "You truly think it's the writing/story that makes those campaigns good/great, though? Because I definitely don't. I do think they're quality campaigns, but it's more about the gameplay and set pieces than the actual story taking place. I've played nearly every CoD campaign and have thoroughly enjoyed *most* of them (Black Ops 2 campaign is not good and easily has one of the worst stories in any CoD campaign) but in terms of story they're pretty consistently on a level that ranges from Michael Bay to decent Tom Clancy thriller at their absolute peak.\n\nLike I do agree that Infinite Warfare's campaign is great and easily one of the best CoD campaigns there is, but I've played through that campaign twice now and I couldn't even attempt to describe the actual plot to you, nor do I remember the name of a single character. And it's not as if I'm not paying attention to those details when I'm playing the campaign, it's just that they are incredibly forgettable in that regard.",

We keep buying this crap that just gets shoveled out once a year, and your casual gamer that plays a couple of rounds a night won\u2019t care. I totally get that, but I really do feel like as a whole we need to get together and stop buying overpriced garbage. The 70 USD for a base and incomplete game is honestly insane, and I wish more people would get on board with it, so that way we could get some good story or games in with the homies again. \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely correct, they used to be great, and I heard the MW3 (2023) campaign was absolutely atrocious.",

I don't think there is a single CoD game that I would consider to have \"great\" writing. There are some that I would consider to have \"good\" writing, such as Modern Warfare 1 and 2, but even in those games the story is secondary and acts more as a vehicle to transport players from one set piece to the next. Now if we were talking about the quality of the campaigns as a whole? I'd absolutely agree with the \"good to great\" part.",

            "I guess if you actually play them all, the sale is real, but many people I\u2019m sure just buy because of FOMO",
            ">If you have a lot of steam games it's totally worth it.\n\nI think I'm nearing 150 steam games, half of which haven't been launched \ud83e\udd23 is that enough?",
            "It's been out for like what, almost a year now? Everybody who would buy full price or 10% off has already bought it",
            "Humble bundles",
            "It was probably more of a case of streamlining. Why make customers jump through more hoops? Why facilitate so many unnecessary transactions? And, as I said, it makes it less exclusive if those flash sale prices just become the de facto sale prices because anyone can refund.\n\nBy 2016 Steam had enough of a brand that they probably knew people were going to buy during the big sales anyway and they no longer needed flash sales to entice us anymore. After all, here we are still getting hyped up after almost a decade of lackluster sales.\n\n>They could, for instance, create a policy where you\u2019re blocked from buying a game you refunded in the last few days or something along those lines.\n\nAll that would do is create grief and buyer's remorse and the same problem as before of making customers scared of buying anything until the last day.",
            "Maybe, but I was never concerned about the minority of people who lack that basic amount of self control because I was too busy enjoying mega cheap games at discounts that don\u2019t really exist on steam anymore."
