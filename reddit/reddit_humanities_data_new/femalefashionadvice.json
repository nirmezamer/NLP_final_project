            "Valentino just surprise dropped the first collection from Alessandro Michelle since he took over as creative director as the last day of Men's fashion week in Milan, and it looks very...... Gucci. Curious what does everyone think?  \n[https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/resort-2025/valentino](https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/resort-2025/valentino)",
            "Commenting what I posted elsewhere, but personally I hate it lol but don't know why because there are plenty of elements there I should love but\n\n-way too many looks/pieces \n\n-not sure where the Gucci ends and the Valentino begins \n\n-I don't like this particular mashup of preppy+boho: like if Queen Elizabeth had gone to Coachella? With details and prints that 20 years ago would have been called \"ethnic\" ...idk it doesn't make me the think the people wearing these things are very likeable or intriguing people, and I think that's what I want to feel when I see a collection, like am I interested in knowing these characters more. In this case, nah not really. \n\n-not feeling all the fur\n\n\nThings I do find interesting: \n\n-the color palette\n\n-the return of early 2000s-2010 silhouettes and colored tights",
            "So many looks!!!\n\nI actually liked a lot of like one off pieces, or a specific thing about a look, like the silhouette of [this coat](https://assets.vogue.com/photos/666f10cc4537ba4afbbdca63/master/w_2240,c_limit/00022-valentino-resort-2025-credit-ola-rindal.jpg), but I can't tell if I actually like the look or even actually like the coat itself?\n\n[This](https://assets.vogue.com/photos/666f10d1c497cb18a470ff8d/master/w_2240,c_limit/00031-valentino-resort-2025-credit-ola-rindal.jpg) is the kind of funkiness that was missing from prep recently though. It feels like the \"old money\" and the \"dark academia\" versions of prep have largely taken over, and it doesn't feel like prep was originally as clean. It's messy, it's collegiate and funky and experimental and there's definitely at least a desire to be counterculture originally that gets stamped out when it turns into old money, and even a little bit erased/whitewashed when it's dark academia. I feel like I've seen [this idea](https://assets.vogue.com/photos/666f10d48d2530d9d4cd54b6/master/w_2240,c_limit/00037-valentino-resort-2025-credit-ola-rindal.jpg) in schools before, is all. That said it of course is still a sendup and not actually messy or accessible, since well...it's valentino lol.\n\nAlso, even though I wrote the above paragraph, the dominant looks here are pretty beige, which I don't care about. Even the fun patterns were largely still neutral (where neutral == the neutral colors of like the us)"

It was originally a $400 dress and I got it for $60 in good condition. I've gotta say...wow, such a disappointment. I'm really glad I only paid $60 for the dress and not full price. The quality...I mean it feels to me honestly like the quality of a decent Target dress I wouldn't pay more than $30 for. And these are being sold for $400?? It is absolutely wild to me. If I had paid $400 for it I would have been very upset considering I have way less expensive dresses that are much better quality. I would expect at that price point for a piece of clothing to be stunning and feel luxurious but it absolutely does not. What expensive brands have you had this experience with? Who is charging obscene prices but not giving the quality they should? \n\nEdit:\nThought I'd add a few brands that at least in my experience are worth full price...I still prefer a sale or buying secondhand though haha\n\nMadewell, LL Bean, Abercrombie and Fitch (a bit divisive maybe, but everything I've bought so far has been great), and for designer Agua by Agua Bendita (I have only had two dresses from them secondhand but the quality is so stellar I think they are worth their full price)",

Aside from a puffer I bought there (I trusted them on that as a Canadian brand and have not been disappointed with it), everything I\u2019ve come into contact with of theirs seems ludicrous. Over $100 for a sweater that\u2019s 80% synthetic, already pilling IN THE STORE, and also hung on a hanger in store so the shoulders are all stretched out and busted? No way.",
            "I don\u2019t know why but my first thought was Sandro. They are selling the French image. It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t like the thrifted pieces I have but I tried on some of their stuff at Bloomie\u2019s and while I liked the cut and movement of, for example, a dress, it was not worth 500 USD. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if the same thing is going on at Sezane as I only have one blouse from them. \n\nI also like Reiss a lot but I think they are overcharging. Their sale prices are closer to what I think the designs are worth.\n\nAnthropologie is hit or miss. They have some absolute amazing bangers that I\u2019m ok with paying $150. But they have so many little brands under them and inconsistency that I am never sure what I\u2019m going to get, and always go to try on in person. \n\nAritizia is also absolutely worth it for a few staple pieces like the enterprise skirt but they are probably charging twice as much as I feel they should for a lot of things.",
            "Conversely, what brands ARE worth the full\nPrice?",
            "Oh I have a long list. Zara, Anthropologie, Free People, Abercrombie, Everlane, REFORMATION, Aritzia, almost every fashion shoe company. They're out here selling 100% polyester for hundreds of dollars. It has to be a joke. \n\nAt Old Navy, I can easily find 100% natural fabrics for a fraction of the cost.",

            "Every brand that charges more than $80 for a piece of clothing made out of plastic. Or all of those designer bags that cost hundreds  or even thousands and are made in china or Vietnam, are no longer hand made and aren\u2019t even leather.",
            "Honestly? Sezane. I hate to say it. I was obsessed with the brand for a few months, but after getting a few pieces which I'm happy with and love, I can't really seem to justify the price, and the novelty had since worn off. It's to the point where the quality and price mismatch is drastic enough that I no longer shop there. You're mostly paying for the idealized French version of yourself.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0If I had to recommend, the Gaspard sweater and the Chlo is worth its price.\n\n\nBanana Republic and Madewell I think are brands that are great on sale. Madewell and Levis jeans are worth full price, to me. LLL leggings and Nike are also great full price.",
            "Reformation ! Some of their dresses material is so unforgiving and not breathable. But I love their cuts! So much so that I had my wedding dress made by a tailor that used their pattern exactly but with much nicer material and in white.",
            "All of them.  I hate them. \n\nI used to LOVE shopping.  It was a problem but I loved it.  Over the years, I\u2019ve become muuuuch more minimalist and my closet is about 1/10th of what it was.  I\u2019ve been pickier about what I buy simply because I want to really love it and feel good about it!  And I\u2019ll pay for quality!\n\nExcept, there is no quality to be had.  The closest I\u2019ve come is Madewell and Abercrombie on sale (and I\u2019m grateful for those pieces!) but it just feels like I really no longer enjoy shopping and it\u2019s become a source of dread for me.  Hunting down pieces that work for my aging frame, that are comfortable, quality, attractive?  It\u2019s a needle in a haystack.",

            "Doen. I frequent a consignment shop that has a ton of Doen dresses and they're all sort of shapeless house dresses made out of thin printed cotton with frilly collars. I also ordered a dress from their \"heirloom collection\" that was, I want to say, 600ish and the stitching and the rouching down the front of the bodice was laughably crooked and it was the LONGEST dress I'd ever seen, like made for a 6'5 woman. It went on sale for half price a few months later which was, IMO, still too much. \n\nReformation is something I'd never buy full price again just because they're so hit or miss (and having bought some of their deeply discounted non returnable items during their sales - I highly recommend knowing your size/how the garment fits beforehand because their sizing feels like it's all over the place and the colors aren't as pretty as they are on their site). \n\nSezane feels like it used to be quality (I have a 100% silk dress that I purchased second hand a few years ago that's beautiful) but has gone down hill the last few years. \n\nStaud handbags are beautiful but their clothing is meh in quality. I have a ribbed dress that literally feels like its made out of a 99 cent store table cloth.",
            "Just about all of them honestly. Apart from couple lower end brands almost everything seems overpriced for the cheap production and fabric used. I almost exclusively thrift or buy things second hand because it's hard to justify $80 on a new skirt that has lose threads and is 100% synthetic.\u00a0",
            "REFORMATION. Poor stitching that frays, UNLINED dresses, exposed zippers, cheap polyester, a history of horrendous labor practices under the guise of *sustainability* \u2026 no thanks, and especially not for the price point. Better off with a local/indie designer or secondhand designer. \nThe styling online & silhouettes are nice though, I can see the appeal but it\u2019s comparable to Zara quality to me.",

            "Michael Kors anything. Bags, clothing, etc. I find the styles and designs to be dull. In fact, anything with the brand\u2019s logo front and center. We\u2019re quite literally paying them to advertise their brand.",
            "I\u2019ve found gems from most brands, both luxury designer and \u201cmall\u201d brands (Banana Republic, J.Crew, Madewell, etc,.) but there are some that I don\u2019t necessarily think are bad or cheaply made, just a little underwhelming for the price point- Vince: they seem to be using more and more synthetic materials lately but charge the same amount. They used to be my diehard go-to and I wouldn\u2019t think twice about spending $$$-$$$$ on their pieces, but now I find myself looking to other brands. Toteme: Honestly, there\u2019s nothing spectacular about anything they make. Its not horrible or low quality it\u2019s just meh. Khaite: I own a pair of jeans from them that I absolutely LOVE, but at $500 ( I got them on sale for around $300 ) they are definitely overpriced. And I found them equivalent to Imogene & Willie jeans (which are usually $250- $275). The Row: Beautiful, BEAUTIFUL pieces, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll pay full price again, there are many independent brands that are just as good but hundreds or thousands less. I\u2019ve migrated towards more independent brands for most of my wardrobe purchases now. I find the quality usually meets or exceeds my expectations and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve wasted my money.",
            "I think it\u2019s easier to list who *is* worth it tbh, the other list is too long. I hunt for vintage pieces primarily, it\u2019s about 75% of my wardrobe but I\u2019m still ~just a girl~ and a sucker for new clothes and have tried it all. \n\n-Old Navy: surprisingly good. I get the best basic tanks and sweaters there. Cardigans. I hear the pants are good but I haven\u2019t tried them in a long time to confirm. \n\n-Levis: this is my jam for jeans. Jeans are subjective though. I have long lanky legs, a short waist, I hate wearing jeans, and I only want to buy jeans that I can wear for 6 years, pack up and pull out in a decade and wear again. I want longevity in my denim! This is where I get it. \n\n-Express: stay with me on this. Millennials! Remember when Express was that girl? I promise you that if Express closes down you will see Express on resale sites for high prices in 10 years. It\u2019s mall fashion but it\u2019s not SHEIN fast fashion. Fast fashion has levels and all blended fabrics are not created equal. I fear we are losing the plot, the recipes, the core knowledge here. \n      -The jeans still work for me. \n      -The body contour line?! Listen to me! Come closer! Snatched me in and held me UP so well that I **didn\u2019t have to wear a bra** Yes! I ended up getting a boob job because I said \u201cthis is how I want to live\u201d \n     -I decided I was done with stay at home mom life and who was there for me? Express. The dress pants and button ups? \n\nAt first glance they may seem pricy but they offer coupons like every single day and I basically robbed them for new clothes. \n\nWhen I hunt for vintage: I keep seeing y\u2019all saying that you\u2019ve had things since 2016? That\u2019s not impressive. That should be a given! Stop accepting less than that! I wear things from the 40s that feel sturdy and new. St John\u2019s knitwear, Escada, 90s Express & the Limited for trendy looks, Moschino, it depends on the vibe I\u2019m going for. The hunt is half the fun. You can find these things for under $20 if you take your time. You won\u2019t get hauls but you get quality and things that only you, Fran from The Nanny and an 80 year old named Betsy have.",
            "there's actually a tiktok showing that tons of pricier brands are getting their stuff from shein. free people, for love & lemons, missguided, etc + a girl ordered a top from motel rocks & it came with a shein tag",
            "Much needed analysis. I admittedly waste so much money on \u201cname\u201d brands for their quality and I\u2019m really just a clown at this point for doing so.",
            "I like the cuts and the stitching at Banana Republic however if the piece is made of 100% polyester or synthetic materials, it\u2019s 100% not worth it for me. They have always had quality cotton shirts and have been bringing a lot more natural fabrics like wool and linen but still it\u2019s not a constant.",
            "The gap has really great jeans. I\u2019ve had the same white straight jeans since 2016!",
            "I absolutely love Ganni\u2019s dresses, and I have maybe 10. BUT it is a brand that I will never pay full price for. All, unless a gift, are bought at least 40% off, which I believe is the fair price considering the materials used.",
            "Alice+ Olivia - I can't with the finishing of their clothes, horrendous back zippers, cheap material. I think Zara is more careful with the finishing than Alice + Olivia\n\nAnthropologie \nLoveShackFancy\nReformation - a bought a shoe for $275 and I can't believe how cheap made they are. Unfortunately I had to keep them because I ordered them for a wedding and I had no time to look for something different.",
            "I may draw ire from fans but honestly Tibi. Sales are usually pretty generous and while some viral pieces from recent years since Amy figured out her creative pragmatist thing sell out fast/resell for a fair amount, Tibi for secondhand in my country doesn't hold its value at all, it drops to like $20-$80 usd. So while it's good quality, I don't feel much motivation to buy it at full price.",
            "Across the board, prices have gone up and quality has gone down.\n\nReformation - much of their quality is craptacular and would be even if they were H and M priced. Their linen items are still very good - but still overpriced (thank goodness for Poshmark!) \n\nJ.Crew - hit or miss. You can find quality there and sales, however.  The shirting and cashmere are a poor shadow of their former quality.\n\nBR - the quality has gone way up, but so have the prices. I usually shop Friends and Family for 40% off, but I do think you do get good quality at full price (relative to the high prices everywhere else).\n\nMadewell - not bad at all, especially the denim. Pretty reliable and not expensive (again, this is relative). I have been very happy with this brand.\n\nS\u00e9zane - just no.\n\nAnthro - hahahahaha\n\nDesigner brands quality and corresponding prices are a hell no from me.  For contemporary brands like Vince, Theory, Veronica Beard - the quality is also way down.\n\nAs I get older, I need quality fabrics and designs that don\u2019t cut corners in order to look my best. I am adjusting to the idea that I have to pay more - but even if I had an unlimited budget, the pickings grow slimmer all the time.",
            "And once again, Capitalism continues to be our downfall as a society.  A little much, I know, but the sentiment remains. For brands to make more profit, appease the board, the Street, stay competitive etc. they need to sell for more and make for less. The cost of raw materials goes up, the cost of synthetics goes down or goes up less and there are more options.  \n\nI recommend listening to this Culture Study podcast episode diving into this very subject! \n\n[culture study \u201cwhy do clothes suck now?\u201d](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6MRAVlZALF9G3Dkw0UFq1G?si=CD0HgdIMQJSOyN_Z9JqsGQ)",

            "Honestly? Dior and the fact that they\u2019re charging 3K for a bag that costs $60 to make is absurd to me. It\u2019s not even made ethically so what\u2019s the point of paying luxury these days? \n\nVery few brands are worth full price - I paid $45 for real leather leggings by Joseph and I know they go for soo much more in the actual store. Would I pay $1600 for them? Nope. Know where to shop and what to shop for is what I learned",
            "Imo no brand is worth full price. Everything is either the cheapest possible fast fashion produced under horrible conditions... or still produced under horrible conditions but marked up to high heavens.

I used to think they were a great value brand and now I don\u2019t think most of the stuff is worth it even for their relatively affordable price point.",
            "My take on this is that a brand\u2019s full offering is rarely worth the price. There are brands that consistently disappointed me (looking at you Anthro), there are brands that I have been pleasantly surprised by but then there is one thing I buy and I absolutely hate the quality. These days you have to be so careful about inspecting each item - fabric content, stitching, any linings, seams etc. and of course also how the design sits on your body shape/fit)",
            "The decline in quality (and increase in cost) at Anthropologie is so depressing. I have some Anthro pieces from before 2016 that are cotton or silk, lined, just generally nice and well-made. One of my favorite skirts I ever owned I bought there on sale for $35, maybe even less, in 2006. I haven\u2019t found anything there that felt worthwhile in quite a few years. And all the skirts are $120+ now. \n\nAlso, I really like D\u00d4EN, but the prices have gone crazy since 2020. Everything is sheer and unlined.\n\nTrashy Diva is another one. The dresses fit my body type well, but everything is rayon now and dresses costs $200+. I also have had issues with sizing and zippers puckering.",

Only buy second hand if it is REALLY discounted.",
            "Truly almost everything. Prices are so high while still using cheap materials. I can\u2019t bring myself to pay full price for anything anymore and only buy used or on sale\n\nThe only items I can think of worth it are outdoor weather gear that\u2019s lasted me a long time.

I don\u2019t mind paying full price for a nice pair of shoes though. I bought $650 Acne Studio shoes that I\u2019ve been wearing for 4+ years now.

My issue more so is with wanting to keep polyester/acrylic out of my wardrobe as much as I can, and finding so many items on these big expensive retailers websites that is all 100% synthetic. Polyester is known to harbor odorous bacteria from sweat. I don't want to be stinky lol. \n\nI'm really picky about linen and don't own much of it, but can say for sure I've bought cotton from Everlane and within a year there were holes in the shirt. I've never had cotton from Old Navy give out on me.",
            "I absolutely agree that natural fabrics aren\u2019t all created equal and 100% natural fabric doesn\u2019t say anything about the longevity of a piece of clothing. If we\u2019re using linen as an example, poor quality linen is a nightmare to wear because it\u2019s scratchy and see-through. Aritzia does a blended linen pant that a lot of people like to drag through the mud because it\u2019s not 100% linen, but the blend makes it softer, sturdier, and less easily wrinkled. Reformation makes a beautiful 100% linen pant that feels great and looks good, but it\u2019s twice the price of Aritzia and wrinkles like 100% linen does.\n\nGreat fabric quality doesn\u2019t mean a piece is well made either; I have a Mate the Label cotton dress that is arguably the softest 100% cotton I\u2019ve ever felt, but it falls apart every two years on the dot. Everlane\u2019s weekend dress, which is also 100% cotton but less soft, is five-years-old and still going strong.",

I've had to return multiple pairs of pants because the leg seams were stitched weird (you know where one side kind of comes around the front of the leg instead of being straight) and while I like how their jeans fit, they really aren't all that much better than cheaper stores like Gap or even AE in terms of quality.",

            "Oh it is 1000% overpriced!! But I do appreciate the high quality\u2026.which realistically is worth $$$ NOT $$$$+. I dress relatively neutral (with pops of color) and I think they execute neutrals (and colors) well but there are SO many other brands/independent designers that I think are equal but at a much more realistic price.",
            "Yeah. It\u2019s become more of a hunt to find things that are truly worth the price vs. in the past a sweeping collection of beautiful things. I still shop Vince on occasion, and I do love their silks and cashmere, but goodness the use of polyester/rayon is staggering for a luxury brand. I know sometimes synthetics are used for design purposes but it\u2019s seems to be more of a cost cutting measure for them than an intentional design reason.",

I got this a-line midi semi formal dress from Express in the spring of 2002 just to save it for spring 2003. It looked like it had ribbons woven through out, very modern Audrey Hepburn. I had gone to NYC that summer and bought a 1920s cloche hat and Vivienne Westwood heels at a thrift store. You couldn\u2019t tell me NOTHING at that prom. I worked at Wet Seal at the time so I was boujee on a budget with the accessories. What a time to be alive.",
            "We used to have this giant local thrift store, it was housed in what I imagine was a warehouse! I lived in a military area so big population turn over and the locals who stayed for life were oooooold. It was a hidden gem and when the owner died the business got sold to someone who jacks up the prices on the old stuff which breaks my heart. I\u2019ve been slowly collecting for 20 something years now though so I\u2019ve met a lot of people and buy/sell/trade with them. \n\nOh! And I\u2019m addicted to Whatnot. I find so many special pieces there! And people love to chat about fashion, if you\u2019re patient and chill they\u2019ll hook you up with their favorite sellers and the next thing you know you\u2019re talking to a rich elderly lady in Chicago who can\u2019t even pronounce Moschino but \u201cjust wants this shit out of her house\u201d and sells it to you for $20. I met a woman who owned a thrift store in NYC in the 90s \u201cback when the city had balls\u201d as she said lmao and she found me the exact runway Marc Jacobs dress I had been searching for since 2003, sold it to me for $30.",

            "Yeah I agree, design is lovely. I was really shocked by the quality when I looked up close",
            "Ooh I have a couple pieces from there! Not bad for fast fashion\n\nI\u2019ve also heard some good things about LaceMade but I\u2019m too poor to afford it, as secondhand prices aren\u2019t much lower than buying it new. Liz Lisa also seems to have some nice stuff but it looks like it\u2019s meant for a more petite body type, whereas I am 5\u20196 with broad shoulders.",
            "to be fair, the cotton dresses/jumpsuits are alright, but get me far away from anything polyester or organza",
            "I bought a few of their pieces when I was pregnant, but you're right the fabrics aren't my favorite either.",

My Aritzia ones lasted me almost four years, and I used to wear them at least twice a week and washed them once a week.",
            "Exactly! I know it\u2019s expensive compared to Old Navy and other mainstream brands, but it\u2019s cheaper than other brands of similar style.",
            "Yes but again they have that banded part at the top. It leaves a mark on my leg and doesn\u2019t have the effortless look of the Aritzia or the Skims.",
            " Im back and forth and shop a lot in both countries and they are the brand I\u2019ve seen with the most dramatic difference.  They are really pushing into the US market , I think they need to make pricing more consistent.",

            "I happily would pay full price for LL Bean sweaters but I also usually go on Poshmark this time of year and browse and get some good deals. Unfortunately, my winters keep getting milder and I can't justify more sweaters without moving. This is the saddest part of all, that I don't have as many cold days as I have good sweaters. I refuse to part with any of them though, I would actually rather move north.",
            "Ugh but the shape.",
            "I don\u2019t love their clothes tbh, they have some overpriced things that are synthetic blends and the sizing is off for me. But their leather goods are solid and very reasonably priced imo.",
            "Levi\u2019s seem to have significant differences depending upon where you buy them. In my experience, direct from Levi\u2019s they\u2019re amazing. But when I bought some from Amazon (the sale was too good to not give it a try) they were so flimsy and thin.",
            "I feel like I'm always hyping Lululemon, but their clothes withstand 100s of washes and still look good.",
            "wasn't that the brand that said that their pants weren't meant for fat people?",
            "Old Frye is incredible. I have a pair of boots that I bought from them in 2005 that have still been going strong for 20 years(!), and another pair from 2016 that I\u2019ve only had to resole once. I can\u2019t speak to the quality now though. It seems like a lot of formerly great brands start cutting manufacturing corners once they get popular and the quality takes a nosedive.",
            "Some of it depends on the model though.\n\nI have a two pair of 2015 Frye Phillip tall boots, the wide calf pair is the one that I think I will be buried in - they are just feel mfing indestructible.  One pair is wide, one is regular calf, and they both have that hefty, substantial leather body feel to them with full leather soles.  Sure, they're slippery until you scuff the soles up a bit, but that's literally my only complaint.\n\nBy contrast, my 2016 Melissa button boots are lighter weight leather shafts, only have a half leather sole, and the button has already popped off one side so I have to glue it back down periodically.\n\nI have three different pairs of Frye ankle boots (Addie, June, and an older pair that are similar to the short engineer boots but with a tall block heel) and they all vary widely in terms of leather weight and feel (or lack) of substantial quality.\n\nI hate that even established brands like Frye are hit-or-miss when it comes to construction and quality; the price used to be an indicator (that a $300 pair of boots will not be as substantial as a $500 pair) but even now, pricing doesn't really let you know.  All you can do is try them on in person and hope for the best.",
            "Same, sadly trash quality",

            "Right? I wish. I'm pretty rough on my clothes (tend to dry in dryer as I'm often running late and forgot laundry), so most crew necks don't hold up that long. They either pill, become a bit see through, or strength out! These ones (probably like most 100% cotton) are super sturdy in my experience.",
            "Oh man, so jealous! A big part of my wardrobe is from there.  Their skorts, stretchy dresses, and swimsuits are fantastic",
            "Excellent point for sure\u2014I def stay away from certain brands.",
            "Fascinating! I have the Van Gogh dress and the rainbow midi and both seem well constructed. \n\nI tend to stay away from slip material as a lot of companies either use low quality silk or a polyester blend that makes both feel cheap and look weird on my body. Do you know the material of the slip dresses?",

            "I had that happen with a dress from Sandro, absolutely beautiful dress, but made from the cheap type of rayon that is only meant to last one wear.

Like, A, you shouldn't have to dry clean rayon at all!",
            "I just don't understand their design philosophy, all their clothes seem to have the wrong proportions.  They always look off.  I like to wear revealing clothing, so I don't say this in the sense if being revealing, but all their designs look skimpy somehow, like the scale of the details are too small or something.",
            "I had always wanted to try Reformation. It was available on Rent the Runway. I borrowed it for a wedding. OMG. It was disappointing. I lost a looot of weight so I was super excited to wear a nice dress\u2026.. Idk, the fit was really weird.",
            "It is shocking!! The styles are cute and it's all marketed brilliantly but I have more resilient clothing I purchased as a teen at forever 21",
            "And I feel like their clothes are made so small. Like you have to go up 2 sizes so it will fit",
            "FR they sell $200-$400 see through dresses with broken threads that need to be hand washed",
            "They were so much better before (pre-pandemic). The prices were always being justified as they paid their employees fair wages and aimed to have a smaller carbon footprint than other brands. The quality of their jeans was something else!\nsadly after the pandemic they definitely started greenwashing and they no longer made all their clothes in the US. The quality also vastly decreased and you can tell they release collections a lot faster than before :(",

            "I\u2019ve been eyeing their linen blend button-ups. Do they run big/TTS, would you say? I tend to be between a S and M with old navy tops. Especially if they\u2019re \u201cboyfriend\u201d, I size down.",
            "I believe it.\n\nI was at a mall that has a BR right across from anthro. Same price points, and the anthro synthetics were clearly of a much lower quality than BR\u2019s natural fibers. And despite BR\u2019s little renaissance they\u2019ve been having, their quality isn\u2019t as amazing as everyone says. I feel like it\u2019s just fine for the sale prices, but nothing I\u2019m willing to pay their full prices for.\u00a0",
            "The home stuff is a little disappointing too. Items made of lead, never soft close drawers, etc. you get much better quality and features for less from a company like Article even.",
            "Their clothing was decent around 2010-2015ish, yes it was expensive but quality was good and the styles were something you could actually consider wearing in day to day life. I have a silk dress from back then that I\u2019ve worn many times that still looks great a decade later. \n\nNow? You\u2019re paying the same prices for worse quality items that either look like they belong on circus clowns or could very easily be duped for much less at H&M. I haven\u2019t seen anything that isn\u2019t either ridiculously boring or ridiculously ugly at Anthro in years.",

            "It\u2019s not awful but for the price it\u2019s surprisingly meh. I did like the free canvas bag they added, which figures.\u00a0\n\nI rarely buy synthetics, only for working out.\u00a0And even then I\u2019ve been leaning towards wool blends lately.\u00a0",
            "I once got a merino blend dress from them and it was fine, but it wasn't $300 fine. At a similar-level French brand that doesn't drop hundos on marketing and free shipping to America I can't see it costing over $100 full price.",
            "Haha I just don\u2019t \ud83d\ude2d they\u2019re not for me. Linen is abnormally wrinkly\u2026like I\u2019ll steam it and everything but then the shorts scrunch into horizontal dents from sitting in the car. I got very slight wrinkles from my ref shorts!",
            "That is a real issue for me. I used to not worry much about the fabric I was wearing, but now I really would like to wear more silk and cotton, and it is very hard to find something I like. I wonder if it is easier in Europe. I haven\u2019t shopped much for clothing there, but I know my cousins don\u2019t like to wear synthetics, so I assume they have some good places to shop (and they don\u2019t like to spend a ton of money so there must be some reasonable options). I guess I\u2019ll just have to go back and do some shopping.",
            "For me, I think it\u2019s less that it\u2019s high quality and more that the prices reflect the fabric and construction more truthfully. The higher end brands seem to sell the same type of both- but for four times the cost.",

            "I have a few pieces from there that is comparable to higher priced brands. Many of the pieces on the sales floor weren\u2019t that nice though.\n\nAlso commenters are coming from all kinds of backgrounds, so some may only have Madewell, A&F, Aritzia etc to compare against.",
            "This. Their prices are high for what you get unless you hit the 50% off sale, and rarely do the clothes there fit me right. There\u2019s always something at least a little off about how they fit for me.",

She was there for business and nothing else. Starting everything at $1, I think I got 4 pairs of brand new in the box shoes for $7-9 each. 3 of those pairs came in and I laughed at myself because where am I going in 4 inch heels?? I wore a knit sweater with chickens on it straight from a kindergarten teachers playbook in 1991 last October, I\u2019m clearly not a neon faux leather stiletto girl.

Identify the decade the style you like is from, then go vintage shopping. \n\nRight now it\u2019s mostly 90s and Y2K in fast fashion. Some 70s boho, 60s minis and 80s fitted bodice dresses etc\n\nThe quality of vintage dresses is amazing. Substantial materials that drape well.
