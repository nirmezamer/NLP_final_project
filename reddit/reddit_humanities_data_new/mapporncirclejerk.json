So I think because of that \"firmer\" and \"clearer\" reputation, and that most Americans probably feel like they have a better idea of what Switzerland is like it's more cringe to not know where it is. \n\nIt is at the low end of orange though -- If I'd given yellow a more general name (somewhere between orange and green in intensity but not requiring mix-ups with neighbours) it would definitely have been yellow.
