            "There is a Mac version of Hades in Steam, which for me runs flawlessly. I'm assuming Steam counts as \"Native\"?",
            "Boot camp was a simple utility to permit easy booting of Windows x86/64 on Intel Macs. \nApple has since moved from Intel Macs to Apple Silicon.  Apple Silicon can\u2019t (natively) run Windows 10 for Intel. \nApple Silicon can (natively) run Windows 10 for ARM (via Parallels and a download of Windows 10 ARM Edition), and then within Windows 10 ARM Edition, Microsoft includes an X64 emulator (and now a x86 32 bit emulator too, I think) to emulate and run Windows 10 x86/64 apps (ie standard Windows apps).  But just be aware you\u2019re running MacOS, running the Parallels app, running Windows for ARM, and then using a Microsoft emulator to emulate X86/x64 on ARM.  That\u2019s a LOT of work.  While I\u2019ve done this, and it does work (on an 8GB M1 Air), I see it more as a crutch, rather than as something to use for full-time use. \n\nMaybe with the Apple Studio and many-cores, and those apps in Windows 10 (x64/x86) that are multi-threaded, maybe the experience will improve.  But \u2018even\u2019 with Apple Studio, the per-core speed hasn\u2019t improved - one just gets more of them.",
            "Great list! I've also built a simple site to find compatible Mac games along with their metacritic score and completion time:\n\n[macgameslist.com](https://macgameslist.com)\n\nYou can filter by genres and by Apple Silicon native games. The data used is mostly from applegamingwiki and applesilicongames, as well as personal testing (mostly to verify).\n\nI'm also trying to see if we can petition devs to port highly demanded games to Mac (see the most wanted games page).",

            "Im considering to coming back to wow. The game seems to run flawless and smooth on M1x chips",
            "Sorry, not sure how to go about editing the list but I\u2019d like to inform that 7 Days to Die (7D2D) had a recent developer update through Steam and is now fully playable native on M1 MBP Pro Max. \n\nI\u2019ve maxed out the graphic settings and logged at least 5 hours with no issues so far.",
            "This is too funny. MacOS on ARM now supports 10000x more windows games than Windows11 on ARM",
            "I noticed these were not confirmed in the Native column, I have played all of them on an M1 MacBook Air natively without issue:\n\n- Mount and Blade Warband (I've even modded this one with great success)\n\n- Total War Napoleon\n\n- Total War Empire\n\nAlso I was able to successfully run Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy \"natively\" using [Mac Source Ports](https://macsourceports.com/game/swjkja). Big shoutout to the person on the list who suggested this option and confirmed it works for Jedi Outcast for the inspiration.",

If I get a great game/compute/etc. experience, is a fan necessarily a big deal?  What if I can\u2019t hear it?  What if I play music and never notice it?  Is the fan running a full indication of whether something is a joke, architecturally, or not? \n2.  Why, as a user, is Windows 30 year legacy nightmare an issue?  Sure, I can imagine from Microsoft\u2019s POV it might add complexities, but from your POV, why do you care?  Do you compile a lot of code and have to support older code?  Doesn\u2019t your compiler abstract that from you?  \n3.  Why do you think Intel was a terminal burden for Apple?  The 12th gen Intel is cheap, fast, and slots into any old (meaning, basic, not age) motherboard.  I can even run MacOS on it, and I get comparable speeds for compute/CPU related tasks to the entry level Studio, for around $350 for the Intel chip.  Yes, I read the stories about problems and bugs Apple engineers found in Intel chips in 7th gen times, and I read the story that that\u2019s why they decided to put MacOS on ARM, but why was it a terminal burden?  And as a user, aside from the fan (noise), what else is better on the M1?  \n\nI really like my iMac.  I got it for about $800 secondhand, and it\u2019s the entry level M1 version, and it\u2019s grand.  But it doesn\u2019t go head to head with any of my modern Intel machines, even my i5-12400, much less the same with a Radeon 5700 in there, even when both run MacOS.  It\u2019s nice because it\u2019s a well-integrated all-in-one that\u2019s fast enough for the basics, and it was purchased because I wanted a screen larger than a laptop, 4K-5K, to run MacOS.  And I fully agree Apple has done a wonderful job with a new(ish) chip architecture; I just think sometimes it\u2019s exaggerated a bit the importance to the end user.  \n\nThe one area that I think Apple can knock out the competition is on the laptop side.  They have a few things to figure out yet (I understand M2 heat in the MBP13 is an issue for some), but overall it\u2019s very impressive.  On the desktop side, however, the advantage is less clear to me."

Granted, this isn't really a true test, as the multiple layers of translation, running through 2 sets of beta software, are hurting the performance. Have to use an FSR3 frame gen mod to get it to a playable frame rate. The frame gen causes a lot of artifacts. Usually in the bottom 25% of the screen while driving but easily noticeable anywhere with quick camera movements. Tested this with a lowered resolution, but high graphic settings. It is certainly playable like this, but not ideal. The ray / path tracing can get very noisy, but can look pretty damn impressive at times. One of the best showings of the path tracing comes in at the end. The orange fluorescent light that spreads out and fills the alcove, that gets broken up by lighter store signs, looks, mostly okay. I'm not sure if some of the floor tiles are a hard cut off for the ray bounces, or if they are actually a different color. Hopefully, the non max versions of the M4 chips can pull off RT performance like this. I feel like they might already have some solid hardware, that just needs some more fluent software.

            "Thanks for sharing my very good dude! but TBH this kind of look awful? I mean the game. I have zero clue on how frame generation and path tracing work so I'm an absolute noob here. What are the frame rates when you push up the resolution?\n\n2 things that realy stood out:\n\n- The way the image reconstruct from a cloud of dots, exactly like real time editing in Blender. Is it due to path tracing?\n- Is it common for frame generation to miss 25% of the bottom of the frame like that, or do you think it's a software issue with the mod?\n\nAnyway, thank you very much for your post. Very informative.",
