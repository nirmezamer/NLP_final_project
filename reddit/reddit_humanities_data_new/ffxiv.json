            "Are there any rings that are on the index and middle finger?",
            "I have a question regarding the side quests. I wanna speed lvl viper to 90 and have decided to try and do the 29 side quests (leaving 1 for the actual viper quest). My question is, does the lvl of the quest matter, such as can I do a lvl 90 side quest and turn it in on a lvl 80 viper?",
            "So, from my understanding it's supposed to be a better return overall to donate allagan pieces and clear demimateria for Doman Restoration, but given the donation limit is it actually worthwhile to hold onto them for that?",
            "Has anyone begun receiving their DT collectors boxes yet? Haven't gotten a shipping confirm yet on mine.",
            "is there someplace I can find like a text write up of the Ninja rotation? I KIND of understand it, but I'm definitely not playing the class efficiently enough",
            "How many poetics does it take to buy tomestone gear? Trying to figure out if I'll have enough tomes to buy the 660 gear when DT launches.\n\nI'll just need the rings and every armor piece except the boots. I won't need the weapon because I'll be using the Manderville.",
            "I've been kind of on autopilot when it comes to crafting, and I'm not completely sure what HQ% actually does. I obviously don't need it to be at 100% to get a HQ item out of it. So is it a chance for the finished item to be HQ, or is there a threshold that guarantees it?",
            "So is there a reason why ffxiv is literally the only MMO to not have servers located on the east coast or at least toward the middle of the U.S.?",
            "2 questions- When are they giving us the free Fantasia? And when do the graphic updates kick in? \n\nI\u2019m assuming it will be when DawnTrail comes out but I wanted to double check.",
            "How long can we expect worlds to be very congested with long queue times? \n\nIs it just for a couple days at early access launch and then again for another couple days at full launch?  Or will it last like, a whole week or something?",
            "Things in the ring slot are index finger only, besides the eternal bonding one which is ring finger.\n\nThings in the *hand* slot may have a ring included on one or more fingers sometimes, including the middle finger, so combining one of those and a normal ring would get the result. But it'll be specific to that glove, and I can't off the top of my head say what piece you'd need for that as I generally avoid all rings.  \nFirst thing that comes to mind are an Aiming type glove from one of the Ivalice alliance raids, which is rings on the middle and ring fingers.",
            "I know the Ivalician Sky Pirate's Plunder are \"gloves\" that look like rings on the middle and ring finger, [here's someone's glamour where you can see it pretty well in the pics.](https://ffxiv.eorzeacollection.com/glamour/99494/blue-cherry-sunshine)\n\nAs for the index finger, I could be wrong but I thought most rings in the game were shown on the index finger.",
            "Most rings are already on the index finger. Only exception I can think of is the Eternity Ring, which fittingly goes on the ring finger. There are hand gears which have additional rings, which can be on the other fingers. Off the top of my head for middle finger, there's at least two options. [Free Spirit's Ringbands](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/0a5d450f27c/?patch=) has rings on the middle and pinky fingers of both hands.  [Street Handwear](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/2237c469e30/?patch=) has rings on thumb, middle, and pinky finger of the left hand only.",
            "you must be at least the level of a quest to turn it in - so a level 80 VPR can turn in up to level 80 quests.",
            "Most side quests in recent expansions have a level sync label on them, meaning that if you're anywhere within the range of the expansion then you can turn it in. So any sidequests from EW can be handed in at level 80.\n\nNote that it's also not worth holding onto them for later, because while the xp reward does scale to your level, it doesn't scale _well_, so gives a much better % of an XP bar at lower levels than higher.",
            "The sidequests that give xp scale to your level. That's every generic sidequests in the EW areas, they'll scale from 80 to 90(however the scaling isn't so great so in terms of % they're a lot bigger at 80 than at 90).\n\nThere's some sidequests that were added for various rewards such as Tataru's shop in Sharlayan and such and these just give no xp regardless, and are static 90 so you'd need 90 for them anyway.\n\nYou can tell cause they'll show xp or not as a reward, and if you have non 90 chars(such as BLU) they'll show lvl 80 values instead.",
            "It's free profit. It might not be worth it if you spend half your inventory holding on to items (since space is limited) but maintaining a single stack of eg. Clear Demi-Materia III is absolutely worth it.",
            "Worth it, since they effectively double the worth of those pieces until they hit the cap. Why sell for 20k when you can get 40k weekly?",
            "Well, if you send your retainers on 18 hour ventures when you log off for the night, you'll have more than enough allagan pieces to take out there with basically no effort on your part, assuming your retainers are max level. Takes maybe a minute or so to get yourself 40K/week for the cost of a teleport. If you pay for teleports that is. In the end, it is up to you, but I'd say that it is worth it since they are easy to get and the easiest way to get the most out of the enclave",
            "The e-mail I got from Square Enix Europe earlier this week said they aim to have them arrive around the official release date of July 2nd.\n\nSo I personally don't expect any shipping info until like Thursday.",
            "Something like these?\n\nhttps://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/basic-guide/\n\nhttps://www.icy-veins.com/ffxiv/ninja-pve-dps-rotation-openers-abilities\n\nor if you aren't max level yet then try the leveling guides from both sites\n\nhttps://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/leveling-guide/\n\nhttps://www.icy-veins.com/ffxiv/ninja-leveling\n\nAlways hard to tell what level someone is currently at when they ask these questions, so I figured I should link both versions.",
            "Things are gonna change a bit next week, so I'd hold off on learning the rotation until then.",
            "If you go to leveling on icy vein you can set the level to your current level and it'll give you a simple list order breakdown. Ninja is having a big change next week sounds like (Huton is becoming an always on trait instead of a timer you need to manage) so things will change, but if it's overall stuff you're not feeling good on (orders and when to use mudra/ninki/oGCDs in) should still be (mostly) good.",
            "If it's anything like the 50/60/70/80 poetics gear, come 7.0 Aug Credendum should cost:\n\n\n\n* 600 for the weapon (split 430/170 for PLD main/off hand)\u00a0\n* 510/e for chest and legs\u00a0\n* 345/e for the rest of the left side\u00a0\n* 280/e for\u00a0accessories\u00a0\n\n\nTotalling 4,055 poetics to fully outfit a job\u00a0\n\n\nIn your case - two rings and all the armour except the boots - it should be 510 + (3 x 345) + (2 x 280) =\u00a0 2,105.",
            "I don't know off the top of my head, but the price doesn't change between expansions. Go check the combined price of all of those gear pieces of any previous expansion's poetic gear. It'll cost that much.",
            "The only guarantee is if you max out the bar, otherwise the higher the progress the higher the chances of getting an HQ craft.",
            "It's chance to get a HQ item.",
            "Not even close to the only mmo to do it like this actually. Wish it wasn't the case.",
            "The FFXIV NA servers (and for that matter the EU servers originally, which was weird) *used* to be in Montreal. But they had reliability issues, so they moved to Sacramento (and the EU ones went to somewhere in Germany). Presumably Sacramento was the cheapest deal that met their requirements. None of their announcements on the matter referred to ping at all; their motivation was purely reliability, which would explain why they didn't look for somewhere central.\n\nI suspect that, as their HQ is in Japan (a very compact country), they don't really grok the impact of ping on the game's feel. They *know of* ping, and design bosses to tolerate a certain amount of it, but that's a different matter than understanding how much ping is fun.\n\nAs you might imagine, a lot of players at the time were upset that they just swapped west coasters having bad ping for east coasters having bad ping. But at least the move was a boon to NZ/Australian players, as this was many many years before OCE was added.",
            "> When are they giving us the free Fantasia? And when do the graphic updates kick in?\n\nWith 7.0 next week.",
            "Fantasia comes out in a sidequest when 7.0 launches. I believe the quest starts in uldah but I'm not 100% on that.\n\n\nGraphic update: the big stuff changes when early access does, on the 28th. However the update is rolling, so it'll continue throughout the expansion. They've mentioned certain materials may take longer, as well as getting all gear pieces and haircuts updated may tske extra time. So while most things will look nicer, there will be some items that aren't updated and might look a bit out of place. They will be fixed as the xpac progresses.",
            "EW it was about a month, but that was a worst case scenario. It was far worse than anything we'd had before (ShB was smooth basically from the start), and there's a pretty long list of reasons why we can expect login queues to not be nearly as bad this time around.\n\nThat does, however, leave your question with no clear and confident answer. Probably a week? Maybe 2? That's my super unconfident answer based purely on vibes.",
            "Last time it lasted a little while but the servers were full and they couldn't order more(covid shit+transistor shortage). This time they both improved the data center capacities and added DC transfers with basically empty DC(dynamis/shadow and the oceanic servers) so honestly I doubt there's going to be massive issues, although you can expect long queues for the first weekend at least and medium queues for a week or so. Might be able to get decent queues by using DC transfer at the cost of not being able to use retainers and such while you do.",
            "GOD I SAW THAT DROP TODAY AND I WANT IT",
            "There was someone wearing Claws of the Beast with two small gold rings(one had a blue stone) on the index finger and it looked like a small ring was on the middle finger too. She changed gear so can't check it there.",
            "I mean it's only 1m a year over npcing them and that's with 52 weekly trips to the doman enclave. Gil per hour wise it's not astounding actually. Takes 50ish seconds for a total of 20k in a bunch of moderately tedious chunks. That's with a good computer and thus good load times gets worse if your load times suck.",
            "I'm 90 but I've basically derped my way there haha, thank you!",
            "Oh yeah that's a super valid point",
            "So I will have enough once I turn in my endgame tomes. I'm assuming the vendor to do that will be in Rahz at Han?",
            "Ok, thanks. I'm pretty sure I'll have enough once I trade in my endgame tomes, especially since I don't need to buy the weapon.\n\nBut if I need a little extra, then I'll just run Main Story roulette for some tomestones.",
            "> Not even close to the only mmo to do it like this\n\nName any?",
            "Hmm, I would guess either [Classical](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/17ba12f8cf4/?patch=) or [Republican Signifer's Fingerless Gloves](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/dd9956f3948/?patch=) could be what you saw? They share a model which gives claw fingernails and a ring on the pinky finger. It's not the middle finger, but I'm stumped to think of what else it couldv'e been.",
            "A minute a week isn't a particularly straining requirement though, but yeah it's also kinda whatever money, I stopped turning them in a long time ago unless I'm bored/when I checked bozja stuff for DT prep.",
            "It's really simple. You use all of your oGCDs on cooldown, but the specific order can vary based on the fight.\n\nNeed to dip out from a pointblank AOE, use Kassatsu first.\n\nNeed to deal with a lot of movement, save the ability that gives you 3 ninjutsu for last since you can't move while it's active. This way you'll minimize your damage.",
            "On the other hand, things aren't going to change *much* next week. No reason you can't start familiarising yourself if you want a head start.",
            "To be fair you can look into it now, it's just that after you under stand the standard opener and rotation as it is now, you should take a look at one or two of the many videos going over changes to NiN in 7.0 - mainly huton becoming a passive trait and us getting a new job gauge + ninjitsu to fill the gap that would create in our current rotation. The way they've done it, the rotation should barely change in practice, it's just that the reason for pressing some of those buttons when we do will changes a little.",
            "The vendor for converting old tomes into poetics is in Mor Dhona.",
            "Can always hop on a couple of hunt trains to cap all your tomes in no time.",
            "BDO until last month, Mabinogi, Maplestory. Older games yeah but xiv is hardly the only one to make this fuckup. Newer games tend to just put their shit in texas or virgina and call it good enough. You really could've used google to find this out. Not sure why you felt like being combative between this and the previous reply that you removed.",
            "Fairly sure Everquest never had any East Coast servers from my discussions with the devs.",
            "She was a DRK",
            "Oh, ok. I know which one that is.",
            "I would, but I'm working the next few days. And Crystal does all their hunt trains in the morning when I'm at work.",
            "You don't have to limit yourself to crystal, I join hunts on aether and primal all the time.\n\nBut also, no they don't lol. Just looking at the crystal train relay channel on centurio hunts has six trains between 5p-12a yesterday (central US time)."

            "FFXIV to me represents a whole universe to explore. Loads of lore, lots of memorable characters, fragments of a world split across parallel dimensions, even the occasional sucker-punch right square in the feels to make sure you're paying attention.\n\nOne of the things I've been having an unexpected amount of fun with has been the glamor system. FFXIV players know that you can easily spend a couple hours in the character creator and any new look that catches your fancy is merely a vial of phantasia away, and being able to make your gear look like something else opens up a whole new level of creative expression when it comes to your character. Thanks to the glam system I can, with one character, be [a country girl](https://glamours.eorzeacollection.com/193504/cover-0-1667343481.png), [a combat medic](https://glamours.eorzeacollection.com/193495/cover-0-1667341815.png), [a biker chick](https://glamours.eorzeacollection.com/193448/cover-0-1667331289.png), [the devil incarnate](https://glamours.eorzeacollection.com/193509/the-devil-on-your-shoulder-1-1667344013.png), or even [a few different](https://glamours.eorzeacollection.com/257590/cover-0-1718416466.png) [flavors](https://glamours.eorzeacollection.com/192748/full-size-faerie-0-1667004919.png) of [faerie](https://glamours.eorzeacollection.com/192748/cover-0-1667004919.png).",
            "FFXIV has saved my life and that's not an exaggeration. My mental state is very bad and discovering FFXIV gave me something to live for. I started playing a little over 6 years ago, when I was in 8th grade. It has been one of the only constants in my life since then and serves as a way to keep me connected to myself as a human being. \n\nBack in December my partner started playing the game and has caught up recently. I've loved seeing their reactions to the game and I'm proud of how much they've improved. I'm so glad I get to share my favorite game with the person I love.",
            "To me it just makes me feel good to be logged in. Especially when my friends are around. It's a nice way to just escape from the real world for a while.",
            ">\"What does Final Fantasy XIV mean to you?\"\n\nBeing happier and at piece with my life.\n\nMy friend introduced me to the game in 2015 after I ran into him after years of no contact. My brother started playing not long after, and we all had good times playing together. My brother has since quit, and I'm currently unable to play the game, but FFXIV is a game I will always hold dear.\n\nLife has had its up and downs over the years, and FFXIV has always been a stable constant that I can go to, and remember that things can be better.",
            "This game basically got me through quarantine and some pretty chaotic moments around then. I'd already had some friends but getting them to play it most definitely strengthened our relationships and I don't know that we would've played anything else together as much as this. It's now become my go-to game for throwing on a podcast and just chilling.",
            "I used to play FFXIV with friends but they dropped off a while back. But even if I don\u2019t have any solid friends in this game, I really enjoy watching people run around, sit and craft, or just seeing them hanging out. The world feels alive. My FC organizes hunts and it\u2019s just amazing how much people love this game. \n\nI\u2019m really glad I started playing about 3 years ago now and am super excited for DT. Hope the game continues to grow.",
            "It's been a great experience where I've been able to meet some excellent people. I started a few weeks ago and on my first day I had a guardian angel following me around a bit, she was really sweet and level 90! I'm only level 20 but I'm having a blast.",
            "Big congrats to 1 million members! The subreddit has been through a lot like the game and here's to many more!",
            "ffxiv is a place to raid and talk with my best buddies !",
            "Anytime I try another MMO, I wonder why the hell are there so many restrictions to what you can do. As someone who likes a solo character, it means a lot to me that I can just keep returning to my WoL and not fee like they are another faceless pawn.",

            "FFXIV.  It's been a long journey.  I started in FFXI back in 2005 and then slowly opened up to give the new kid on the block, FFXIV, a chance back in HW.  I've laughed with you all, cried with you all, enjoyed every moment.   In 2020, I had about 20 clots lodge in my lungs (due to a misdiagnosis caused by the pandemonium of early covid) and I started to deal with heart failure as a result.  I especially treasured the moments in Endwalker, because I figured they might be my last ones and I've really slowed down to enjoy the little things in life and gaming.  (Thanks to open heart surgery and lung surgery in 2023, I am here and well.  My lungs are clear and my heart is spectacular).

The thing I should have known for a long time but regress it down too much I lost track of it. It's like when playing a role playing game with customisations, you have the chance to be yourself with freedom. So that really helps me to look deep into myself, see what it is and accept it.

He picked it up, I made a new character to run things beside him, and we've never done an MSQ quest without each other since!

I can laugh with my grandmother as we make the weirdest lalafell and hrothgar characters in character creation. I can tease my brother about poly grapes. I can gush over the music with my dad. I can show off some of the ffxiv inspired recipes to my mom. It's something fun we can all enjoy.\n\nIt's been a way to find and make new friends. I met a lot of my current online friends through FFXIV, and they showed me the ropes of not just thr game, but also the gaming community as a whole. I got to explore things outside of my comfort zone and find new things to enjoy, like music, TV shows, games, food, and so much more.\n\nIt's been a way for me to connect with myself. I've been able to explore so much of myself on ffxiv even when the world outside my door was terrifying. It's been a comfort and a joy to experience the journey as the WoL of light. I've made art, learned music, and found an interest in cooking because of this game. \n\nI recommend this game to so many people. It's ridiculous, but it comes from a place of joy and excitement. Ffxiv, as a game on its own, is amazing, but its community is just as good. You all are such a welcoming group to newcomers. It's really something special :)",
            "Personally, FFXIV has been something I've been looking for in a game in a long time, back when I first tried it out during the pandemic it was special from the beginning, even if I had played RPGs all of my life, I never had the chance to play an MMO and what an experience it has been, I've gone from being that scared sprout that wouldn't play anything but DPS and listening to all advice I could to avoid messing up and getting better at the game, to now looking forward to playing DT as a SCH and it's now me been the one helping people figure out mechs and doing all I can to save the run when things get rough, even if I still mess up things here and there.\n\nThe community has also been amazing, some folks you will probably never meet again, but that little chat or experience in a dungeon/trial or during events that made you laugh or just genuinely leave with a smile in your face, or that person that finally helped you figure how to do something you've been struggling with, it's always a great experience.

You still have random bad actors but it feels like a living world. The diversity the job systems provide has always shone through. I'm excited about how FFXIV will grow.

            "What does FFXIV mean? Well it is alot, but I'll try.\n\nI think the biggest thing FFXIV is for me is an emotional experience. There have been more than a few mental health issues over the past decade or so of my life, and I do not mean to insinuate this game was somehow a magic solution to mental health it did help. One component that kept recurring in many of my struggles was understanding my emotions and processing and expressing them in healthy ways. So, finding a story that elicited emotional experiences while talking about why the characters are motivated to feel the way they feel. On top of that, the community's shall we say great enthusiasm for sympathizing and empathizing with others as they experienced was a great influence on me for sharing my feelings and being more aware of the feelings of those close to me.\n\nBut to say FFXIV was just emotional story telling would be selling it short. I have a particular fondness for the music. I haven't had a game that managed such a wide variety of styles so we'll from the more traditional rpg video game music with orchestras and choirs to banging rock songs to lofi dance remixes to slay evil to. I have always been a music need? So it has been a joy to hear what the game and the music team bring next.\n\nThere is more, much more; hunting down glamors, getting sucked into crystalline conflict from time to time, even dipping my toe into higher end content for the first time in any mmorpg I have played. But, I think that is enough to get across what I feel FXIV is to me.",

I've had so much fun, I truly love hopping on the game each evening, because FFXIV means friends, a fun night in store, and usually some rare achievement I'm vying to grab (with some antics along the way). Even if my friends aren't on, I can always queue a roulette and strike up a conversation in MSQ, or gather around my fellow fishers as we all lament not being able to catch Ruby Dragon.

My twin brother started playing while he was in college but I just kept saying no when he asked me to play. However, I had recently broken up with my girlfriend of two years and therefore had a lot more disposable income. \n\nThat relationship was awful. Somehow, her hitting me in the head wasn\u2019t the final straw, but that\u2019s a story for another day. I figured that with her out of my life, my general outset toward life would improve, but it didn\u2019t. A couple months before I started playing, I was diagnosed with depression. I just felt like I was sinking and couldn\u2019t possibly pull myself out of the rut I was in. The doc put me on an antidepressant, but unfortunately, it didn\u2019t really work for me. \n\nMy brother was home because of Covid and told me about all the cool mounts and how all of them could fly, even the turtles. I thought it was funny and figured I\u2019d give the game a shot. At level 15, I beelined it for the Gold Saucer and grinded for the mount overnight. Even though I couldn\u2019t fly yet, I liked the story of the game so I figured I\u2019d at least play through to the end of the story. About halfway through Stormblood, I was swapped to another antidepressant.\n\nI still felt horrible about life in general, but I continued playing, just to catch up to my brother and play some with him. The antidepressant that my doc put me on was definitely working. I remember in the middle of the first fight with Ran\u2019jit, I stopped and noticed that I genuinely felt excited about something for the first time in a long time. From then on, I started to get more involved in the other systems in the game since I genuinely could enjoy them now.\n\nMake no mistake: FFXIV didn\u2019t cure my depression, but it gave me something to find joy in when nothing else did.",

However, I can rest easy knowing that no matter how dire things might get, XIV is an optimistic tale where good and the human spirit always triumphs over evil. I also specially appreciate that you, the player, get to be in the driver's seat of that fairy tale, and that besides being the grand world-saving hero, XIV's side quests also allow you to be at the ground level, helping the people and doing acts of community service.",

At the same time, due to the difference it was difficult to connect with my friends and family back home. Luckily, my friends are very persistent and suggested we play a game and try and spend more time together (I think we all needed it). On a whim based off the reputation and free trial, I suggested we play xiv. It then became a powerful bonding tool as I was physically recovering and honestly, quite a good story on top of it all. It also help rebuild my sense of adventure and curiosity that led me to moving in the first place. I cannot wait to take my WoL on a journey to new lands as I further improve myself out of game and explore the areas around myself.",

We've spent ages just sitting around and chatting at the fountain near our FC Home.\n\nIt's the ultimate social MMO for me since I found a group of people that let it be so. I'm thankful for those days where I stayed home sick and while I'm miserable I was still able to have a social lifeline by interacting with all the people in game.

I continued as they fell off through ARR but I found and made new friends.\nI quit about halfway through Heavensward. I got tired of statics constantly falling apart due to Alexander woes. I eventually came back a month before Shadowbringers and fell in love again.\n\nFinal Fantasy 14 is my comfort food.",
            "To me ffxiv means friendship but also just how many wonderful experiences have been opened to me because of it. It's about making connections. \n\nAside from the briefest of moments playing in the 2.0 beta, the only reason I started playing was because my friends played. I was very apprehensive about it because I had a not so great wow addiction that I got rid of a few years prior. So I stubbornly said no at first.\n\nThen I learned that my other group of friends also played. \n\nStill I declined because I wasn't confident in myself to not get completely hooked again.\n\nI visited the Eorzea cafe in Akihabara which I was totally clueless about, but being a FF fan in general still absolutely loved it! (Wonderful experience no.1)\n\nSo I caved and got the free trial which didn't include HW yet. Didn't really like it though especially when it came to the story being locked behind dungeons. So I left it there.\n\nThen I went to Distant Worlds and they played Answers and Dragonsong. I was absolutely blown away! (Wonderful experience no.2)\n\nI knew I *had* to give it another chance and in April or May 2019 I finally started playing.\n\nI've become very close with my friends via XIV, especially during covid. I've reignited the bonds I had with that second group I mentioned because we had drifted a bit since leaving highschool. Suddenly I'm in a discord with them and meeting new people they had met over time. I have had SO MUCH FUN just being in voice with them and it's thanks to XIV that I even ended up there.\n\nI've become more active in making art because I'm so inspired by this game with its wonderful characters and incredible music. I think this is the most wonderful thing of all because I've had art block for around ten years. I'm so rusty but now I've got something I find passion in, I can work towards getting better.\n\nAlso the characters in this game are just some of the best. I never thought a villain would ever be my absolute favorite character in a video game but then in SHB >!Emet-Selch!< showed up. \n\nI've found wonderful content creators via XIV like Shenpai and Jocat. I've also met some voice actors from XIV at conventions. \n\nOh and most importantly, I don't feel the same way about this game as I did wow. I'm able to take breaks and not worry about logging on. I'm not constantly thinking about it 24/7. It's a comfy form of escapism, not one that stresses me out.\n\nThis game has made me cry more than any other, has made me laugh, made me angry and made me so excited to log on and spend time with my friends who I can't see in person very easily.\n\nI've realized that a MMO is perfect for final fantasy because to me a good FF game is one that you never want the story to end, and with xiv it keeps going with each expansion.\n\n\"Eternal winds to the land descend\nOur journey will never end.\"",

As I am new I don't have many stories, but I think this one is important to why I am hooked right now. \n\nI was doing a FATE, and some higher level party that was chilling near helped me complete it faster, so I expressed my gratitude using the Bow emote, the thing is I was focusing the minion of them. As I was leaving to continue doing another things they messaged me to basically tell me she was laughing about missing the focus and bowing her minion, I went back to talk to them as i am on trial and can't yet respond tells.

And at the time of me starting, I hadn't even known an expansion was coming. So I was thrilled to learn I'd just finished this amazing content, and now there'd be even more to do!\n\nFF was also an escape for me,at times where I was really struggling with mental health problems.

Jmb and Bigcheese thru suicide. \n\nBob and I decided to join Chibi in FFXIV, although he was on a different server and transfered. His dad came to play too. I set my daughter up with an account and we still play together.

I don't know why the mobs pass the people in front of me to run up and smack me! \n\nIt's just nice to be able to all gather in the living room and play together as a family.

This game is filled with various activities that cannot be found in most other MMOs. Tired of combat/dungeon runs? Crafting, gathering or the Gold Saucer are there to do something different. How about trying out a new class as well? Never have I seen an MMO where jobs are not hard-coded to a character unlike in Wizard 101, where you're stuck with a primary school type for the rest of your journey over there.\n\nAt the time of writing this, I'm still a Free Trial Sprout and I plan to one day get the full experience once I feel like I experienced everything the Free Trial has to offer - though certain Free Trial limitations did made me think about buying it sooner at times, hah!",

Nothing like a day after of work of just brainlessly running dungeons, gathering resources and crafting with them.  \nIt is tension. The story, what will happen next? or will I win the Jumbo Cactpot this time? Or will I win the RNG of dungeon loot for that pet or mount I've been trying to get? Or will get that house that I've been waiting to buy for hours?  \nIt is expression.

            "FFXIV to me means several things, but the first that comes to mind is a change in how I see MMORPGs as an old-school MMO player who started with... MU Online lol. Having grown up with games like MU Online, Ragnarok Online and Lineage II, I never believed for a second that an MMO out there could have a good story. Story and lore were just the thinnest of excuses to go out and kill monsters in those games, and I came into FFXIV with that mentality, thinking \"Story? Nah, can't be any good. I'll just rush the MSQ\". I will mention I'm a long-time jRPG fan too, so in hindsight I can see the irony of going through the MSQ the first time not reading a single line of text, just assuming it was bad like the others. But then my FC at the time convinced me to give the story a try when NG+ came out, and boy oh boy did it make me feel dumb for ignoring it the first time. I now consider FFXIV's story to be one of the best, if not *the* best, stories ever told in a videogame. I am now impatiently waiting for DT to launch, and after I finish the MSQ and while I work on EX trials and such, I plan to do another full playthrough of the MSQ in NG+.  \n  \nFFXIV also represents my hope that the MMORPG genre isn't doomed. There are many cashgrab MMOs coming out nowadays, full of p2w mechanics or simply so bad they shut down within a couple of years. There's also been a big move away from the social aspects of MMOs and more towards single-player games that require an internet connection. At first I thought FFXIV was part of that latter problem, but seeing the communities that form, how people make incredible things such as stage plays and concerts... It's a different type of social game, but definitely a very social game. It was a big mentality change on my end in this regard as well, and it gives me hope that there are still games out there that put the MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER part in MMO first.",

For example, I take some pretty alright screenshots which I am proud of, and every time I want to take a screenshot, I always seem to find and learn something new with GPose (Group Pose) ([Example](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/623050458247987212/1159294852656283718/ffxiv_10042023_192323_664.png?ex=667185b7&is=66703437&hm=b5e0e62bbae0867655db5e9f82236af32dffc30a8baa123eb5e3de836dd6641d&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1193&height=671)).

Crafting and gathering, roleplaying and socializing, high-end raids and content, achievement hunting, and so much more. It is impossible to do everything it has to offer, so only do the things you like to do.

For all the criticism I may have about some aspects of the game, I still love it to death: I love how rigid and predictable the schedule of updates is, I love how it looks, the flavour and hints of \"Final Fantasy\" through the MSQ, the amazing fights throughout the expansions, but also the incredible OST. \n\nI don't even have any IG friends, in the end. I'm just a solo player that subs for savage mainly, and also subs once for other major patches. My interest lies in doing clearing the hard content the game has to offer. But, compared to other MMOs, my life doesn't have to revolve around it: I can just play or... not play. Got a busy weekday ? Meeting with friends during the weekend ? Taking holidays ? Sure ! This is not a korean grindfest. I can afford to not think about the games for months, while also knowing when I'll come back. I already know that this savage tier I'll be able to aim for a quick clear, but the next one will be tougher because that's when I'll begin my internship. I'll still be able to enjoy the game, but at a more reasonable pace. \n\nIt has set such high expectations for me when it comes to not only making a great game players would like, but also making a game ACTUAL PEOPLE THAT HAVE LIVES outside the gaming sphere would like that I don't know whether I could enjoy any other online game as much as I do XIV. I would qualify as a midcore/semi-hardcore player, and while I don't really care that much about socializing, RP, very casual content etc, I like that the game caters to everyone somehow while respecting (or at least trying to respect) their time.\n\nI might not play it forever, but I can't imagine a day where I'd stop playing. I would still be interested in following what the WoL & all the other characters would do across new areas, new expansions, and what new raids it will have.",
            "I only got into the game a couple of years ago, but I WISH I had gotten into it sooner. I\u2019ve always been in love with MMORPGs since I was a kid, but I would only be able to play the free ones (which weren\u2019t ever really free because of the hidden paywall you eventually hit lol) since my parents couldn\u2019t afford subs, understandably so. \n\nWhen I finally got a job and was bringing in consistent money as an adult, I\u2019d only ever really spend it on single-player games having lost my passion for MMOs.\n\nThat was until I found a little video on FFXIV blowing up on Youtube. Now, I couldn\u2019t tell you what that video was anymore (yay short-term memory), but I quickly downloaded the game and it\u2019s been the game I have the most hours in, even after taking an almost year break in between. \n\nFFXIV is a fucking great game with a great community. I literally posted a post on here recently about failing in a dungeon and instead of being toxic towards me, y\u2019all shared your own embarrassing stories and made me not feel so alone. \n\nHappy 1M followers WOLs! \ud83e\udd73",
            "FFXIV to me means inner growth and connections it started as a way to not go stir crazy during COVID lockdowns. But as my WOL grew throughout the story I also grew. The community built in this game whether it be strangers or fellow FC members helped me get better with my anxiety of socializing. It was a small step in my ongoing journey to overcome my anxiety and agoraphobia but one of the first ones I took and an important one to me. Who knew overcoming the panic of just barely managing to type, \"first time\" in a new duty would slowly get the ball rolling in being able to advocate, stand up for myself, and move halfway across the country. My WOL was there through the whole journey and changed just as much (thank you fantasias and MSQ). And I can't wait to see how me and him continue to grow during the new few years of Dawntrail.",

This is game has really brought me back to my childhood on why gaming provides such an amazing experience. \n\nI am only a free trial member and currently going to Heavensward but I\u2019ve read every single dialogue and have truly immerse myself in the world building and stories. This game feels like an adventure and I am the main character. The music brings an atmosphere like I\u2019m actually in a real fight and exploring a vast world. \n\nI am disappointed in myself I didn\u2019t get to experience this at a younger age and have waited so long to experience this journey. \n\nFF14 means living life to the fullest and experiencing it. I believe the world we live in today, we look and swipe and move on instead of just appreciating what\u2019s around us and taking it all in. This game has really allow me to reflect on life and to enjoy whatever comes my way. \n\nThank Square Enix. From Kingdom Hearts to the world of Final Fantasy, this is what gaming is. \n\nProviding an experience that is like no other.",
            "For me FFXIV is all about bonding with my partner. It's been our go to game to play together since 2014 and we've done just about all there is to do in the game together. That's why XIV is so special to me. :)",

Especially since I was only around 16 at the time and didn\u2019t have anyone my age to play with at the time, there were so many late night memories and fun experiences that I tried with my FC mates that have still stuck with me 5 years later. When I was at my high school graduation without any friends, they were there for me too to cheer me up. In the game, without them I probably wouldn\u2019t have tried raiding or be so enamored with screenshots/glamour. I\u2019m sad that those days are gone since some have continued onto a new chapter of their lives, but I\u2019ll always remember this game as having such kind people who really made up a large part of the end of my childhood",

            ">**What does Final Fantasy XIV mean to you?**\n\nFF14 might be my favorite FF title; I flip between this one and FFT for that spot. Not only is the story really good but there is always more of it coming. It's also the \"latest\" FF game I feel inclined to play since newer installments have gone more into the ARPG direction (which is something I dislike). It's definitely not ideal but the 2.5 cooldown alleviates my disdain for action combat, lol. In any case, I have great memories of playing the game either by myself or with friends, and I hope that it continues to be so.",
            "My general experience with online games is my brain fixating on the idea that if I'm not constantly playing, then I'm losing. Which meant I've avoided mmos in general. After years of reading that FFXIV is good, actually (specifically as a Final Fantasy game), and getting pestered by friends who were picking up the game, I picked it up.\n\n\nWhat has been amazing is I've never felt that with FFXIV. I just play it a lot because I enjoy it. I've taken breaks and I've picked up a bunch of other games in the meantime, but I keep coming back as it's my go-to game. It has plenty of options to chill out or for more intense options, which helps as well.\n\n\nAs of a few months ago, I caught up to current content and have recruited 3 people actively into the game (2 of which hit post-EW credits last night). This has become my favourite Final Fantasy and is one of the only games to ever make me feel the variety of emotions that it inspires.\n\n\nIf you're reading this and you're on the fence about this game, the free trial really does give you 90% of the experience so I would suggest trying it out",
            "I have made lifelong friends through the game. People I hang out with online even if we aren't playing ffxiv. I got reaquainted with old friends through the game, too. It is not an exaggeration to say it made my life so much brighter and better thanks to those connections and relationships, especially when we were dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic.",
            "FFXIV has brought me closer to a couple of longtime friends, including one of my closest friends. We've kept in touch for more than ten years in the same, evolving friend group, but kind of on the periphery. I started FFXIV about three weeks ago and I've been having so much fun - from flying around on my friends' ridiculous mounts, to alternatively struggling and breezing through Leap of Faith, to experiencing the kindness of the random party members when I tried out conjurer and we wiped in a dungeon, to being confused by the mechanics of arcanist. There is just so much to explore, and I look forward to the many memories I'll make with my friends in this game.",
            "FFXIV is friendship, camaraderie, and new friends. I joined a random FC invite on a whim and got friends that waited for me at the UT flowers, join me for games outside of FFXIV, throw friendly jabs at each other while doing stuff, and have helped me through some difficult times. The game itself has helped me through some bad episodes of depression and anxiety with its messages.",

            "FFXIV will always hold a special place in my heart because it has helped me get through the darkest period of my life. \n\nIt gave me something to look forward ro when the future looked bleak and terrifying. It helped me process grief and trauma with its amazingly deep storytelling. My little journey started when I asked my friends, \"Hey, I need a game recommendation to distract me from reality.\" They suggested FFXIV, which became much more than just a temporary distraction. This game feels like home now.",
            "FFXIV is a lot of things to me. Coming back proper after a few years.. Before it was everything. Friends, family, an escape. Now, it's a new beginning, or maybe just a chance to restart. \n\nI'd like to build up my little personal community again to make it what it used to be.\n\nGoing to Fanfest in 2016 was crazy. I hadn't realized just *how many* friends I had made through other friends and from server hopping and joining FCs. I'd like to have that community again and rebuild it as a new dawn arises.",
            "FFXIV is an interesting beast. After hearing about 1.0 flopping, I wasn't interested in playing for years. Eventually some work buddies were playing and that got me interested. Since I played a bunch of MMOs before, I had an idea of what to expect, but getting into the game in Stormblood blew me away. Not only was SCH the perfect job (RIP SB SCH), the story, how pretty and detailed the world is, the music - it was all fantastic. XIV continues to be my favorite MMO and I don't see that changing any time soon.",
            "Final fantasy 14 has been by my side for like 9 years now, crazy to think. For one it's my favorite FF game and my favorite mmo, the stories in this game are beautiful.

            "Final Fantasy XIV is how I reconnected with an old friend from high school. \n\nI met him by happenstance in a grocery store 1500 miles from where we grew up. He was vacationing, I was getting a few snacks for my upcoming days off. \n\nHe hit me with the \"Have you heard about the critically acclaimed MMORPG...\"\n\nI told him I knew FFXIV was an MMO and that's as far as my interest went. He went on (and on and on) about how XIV was different and I could try it for free if I wanted. I figured free was a good price point for a game I'd probably only play a couple hours. \n\nThe next day he came around to say goodbye before heading home and I showed him my character. I had just saved Swiftperch. He gave me a few tips on being a Maurader and tanking in general and promised to catch up with me when he got home.\n\nNow we're closer than we were in school and we spend most weekends doing old content together. It's been fun winding each other up with theories about Dawntrail.",

It was FUN. And after that it has kept me subbed ever since. There is no other gaming community I\u2019d proudly be a part of than FF14\u2019s.",

            "> \"What does Final Fantasy XIV mean to you?\"\n\nFriends, really.\n\nI remember starting 1.0 with a friend, though we both fell out of the game for fairly obvious reasons at the time.\n\nI decided to come back later on when the game went free, just to see what it was like and what was going on. The result is multiple people, even just from 1.0, that I still talk to constantly and game with. In the transition to 2.0 a few followed to our current server, we met more people, neighbors to our FC, etc, and I easily have over a dozen people I hang out with regularly that I would have never met or known otherwise.\n\nIt's a place to goof with them, to get consistently rescued into damage and holes by healer friends. A place to mess with housing designs for others to get to hang out in and hopefully enjoy. A place for a character that's been with me, mostly unchanged, for nearly 14 years (though Hrothgals make taking one of those two decade+ old fantas tempting...).\n\nThe game itself represents a unique title in its genre for how integral the storytelling is to its experience, and how *well* that story is told to the player. There's plenty of criticisms I have for the game even to this day, but it is both unique and unmatched in that regard. No other MMO offers that same experience.\n\nHonestly would be something of a miracle to land a copy since finances suck right now, but either way I hope people find all the fun and adventure they're hoping for in DT whether they've already purchased it or win their copy here.",

I said I was done with MMO-type games after that but I decided to give FFXIV a shot in early 2021 and got hooked pretty quickly.

Gaming was a form of escape for me and FFX came in a perfect time, I absolutely fell in love with the franchise.  \nFast forward a few years again, I got older, made friends irl and online, life is finally good and then I've heard of FFXIV - a Final Fantasy mmorpg?! I've got to play this! Read a lot about it and and most of it was super negative lol. Just when I was about to buy it, servers got shutdown. But then I've learned about A Realm Reborn, how FFXIV is in fact not dead but is getting a major overhaul. I followed this project over the following months but unfortunately couldn't get into it straight away in 2.0 but with 2.1 I **finally** was able to get the game and my. It was love on first sight. I was 17yr old when ARR was released and I'd found my online safe space, FFXIV immediately became to me what WoW was for others, my forever mmorpg.   \nFast forward a last time, Dawntrail is just around the corner, I'm 30yrs old, married, life is even better and FFXIV is still a part of it.

I played Ultima Online, Everquest, FFXIV, and WOW, and never tried any class or role where I had any responsibility (i. e. healing).

Back in the time, my cousin had it and his video card drivers were broken so we watched the CG movies upside down.\n\nFrom there I got my version, and then started my emulator journey. Did FF5 strange translated ROM version then did FF6 which I still think overall is the best FF. Then did the modern Finals did 8 in PC, then 9 in the ps2, I bought a lot of ps1 games and played them in the ps2. Then did FF10 and finally got my first experience the the MMORPG games. When my other cousin bought FF11. Love at first sight.\n\nI played FF11 for looong time, in between I played 12 and 13. And eagerly waited for 14 which I didn't had a good PC to play it, but I was able to run it. I played until lv 20, my laptop was just screaming at me, so I pause it and continue my life at Vana diel.\n\nCircling back to ARR and the launch in PS3. Since I was a legacy PPL I had to stay in the Legacy data center. While my brother decided to start fresh in the new servers with his buddies. I kept telling him that, I get a feeling they'll let us play together eventually... Which they did! I got my char transfer to Adamantoise, and finally we were able to play together!\n\nStory not over one more story to share as one of my most treasured memories. They day of my wedding, it was the release of 3.1. My brother wanted to do the first dungeon together, so we both woke up pretty early, watch the last 4 episodes of Avatar the last Airbender (epic finally) while we did the first dungeon together. As soon as we were done, we and rush to get ready, and finally started all the wedding stuff.\n\nNow at days, he is finishing his medical degree, and me with 3 kids and moved to another country. I'm the only one that keeps playing, but the love of the game and the franchise is still there. One of most recurring topic is FF14, we discuss the patches, the stories. How did you get I experienced the game. Hopefully life will let us play together one more time.",
            "Oh wow I'm amazed at how the growth of the subreddit went from 50k per year to 100k per year, and it seems we're about to reach 200k per year!\n\nI don't care for the contest but I'll regale what FF14 means to me anyway. Note that I started playing on Q1 2021.\n\nTL;DR - FF14 lines up with my preferences, and it gives me endless opportunities for self-expression. \n\n+++++\n\nAs someone who draws anime as a hobby, and likes pretending to be an art style taxonomist of sorts, I only watch anime and play video games with art styles that specifically line up with my preferences. I grew up on Capcom and Square Enix games, so ofc the FF14 art style is right up my alley. I've also had a blast with FF14's plots over the expansions. We ended a war started by our ancestors' sins, had a lot of political drama, and pondered about memento mori!\n\nI'm obsessed with similarities and references, so I express myself through references in glamour, housing, and music.\n\nMost of my glamours are cosplays, to express my interest in the characters cosplayed. I have Simon the Digger on MCH, Ryunosuke Naruhodo on SAM, Gerudo Link on DNC, Tsubasa Syaoran on MNK, No.9 YorHa Boys on WHM, and most importantly, Cloud Strife on DRK, Clive Rosfield on PLD. Currently eyeing Let Me Solo Her on VPR. My DRG is the Odin armor but with a spear, but the reference here lies in the gearset name\u2014Odin Spear, a pun on... Odin Sphere.\n\nMy Ingleside apartment is a room filled to the brim with magitek. I have the G-Warrior, Ultima Weapon and Sapphire Weapon figures on display to show I did Sorrow of Werlyt (FF7 x Gundam was a blast!!!) and also the Forever By Your Side painting. \ud83e\udee0 I made space for the Emerald Weapon because Marida Cruz/Kshatrya. I also have stuffed 2B and 9S, and my phasmascape is a moon. At first I put it there to reference Endwalker, but I kept it because Moongazing/Tsuki wo Miteita.\n\nMy Small house is a Highland composite house, meant to allude to the medieval style houses in the Rosalith. Inside is a starlit barn, a reference to a very specific cutscene in FF16. Interestingly, the crossover gave an orchestrion roll of the song in that specific cutscene! It's called \"Who I Really Am.\" The basement is a cave filled with white glowing flowers, a recreation of... Emil's Memories.\n\nMy FC Room is a failed attempt at recreating Clive's Quarters. I swear I'll need a large for that sh.\n\nI picked ARC as my first job so I can be BRD ASAP. The first music I played? The Price of Freedom. I've since practiced many songs, 80% Hiroyuki Sawano, 10% Soken, and the rest are other stuff like Uematsu/Yosh's Hollow, Survive Said The Prophet's MUKANJYO, and... Zero's Sacrifice! No not *that* Zero. The one who wears red armor and has a bff called X... No, not Twitter. Mega Man Maverick Hunter X!",
            ">**\"What does Final Fantasy XIV mean to you?\"**\n\nWe all have a motivation, whether it be enjoying the moment, spending times with friends, seeking recognition or curiosity over the characters' journey.\n\nMine however couldn't be more different as it is very self-oriented even though I helped more than a hundred or two players and met far more, while playing with countless others. My motivation is but very simple : improving, being a better person, extrapolating any knowledge the game has to offer.\n\nFor many players, \"improving\" is a mathematical or mechanical prowess that ends up having better figures : clearing more stuff, more achievements, or having a higher DPS. That's not what I meant at all and improving, in my opinion, is tightly linked with **responsability**. If I enter an instance with other players, I make it a personal matter to clear it as soon as possible, even if it means creating macro with sound effects to indicate whether something requires to spread out or to share damage. Explaining a boss is much more important than having a high DPS (which is simpler to achieve) and using a healer's or a tank's supportive skill to save someone offer more victories than good crits. Responsability is a driving beacon ; it makes us reliable and allows everyone to... Improve as well.\n\nBeing a better person not only requires being informative, but also understanding. Most people don't want peremptory advices so I usually stick to general pieces of information (if a tank's struggling with mits while trying his best, I simply tell him/her how I'd use mine ; same for healers' CDs and DPS if they seem to want a piece of advice) to achieve my role as a mentor. What I really enjoy though is **teaching** people I'd spend more time with, seeing their progress over several dungeons, extreme then savage so they can be ready for ultimate encounters. Trust me : being able to teach is a reciprocal pleasure !\n\nLeading, teaching are the main reasons why I play FFXIV because they are *skills we use outside of the game*. And there is more : the story also, as every story does, have **insightful knowledge**. My country right now is on the verge of *yielding to the temptation of the apparent easy solution of foreigners rejection* ; FFXIV gave me thorough explanations as to why it's so important to aim at the root (which are institutions failings) just like Garlemald have its issues. I could give you DOZENS of examples. Just seek out your own ones. See in the conflicts in-game how they describe your everyday clashes : FFXIV provides many pieces of wisdom we too easily shake off. I'll simply tell you this : they are far more valuable than you'd think at first.\n\nFFXIV as an MMO has much more to offer than landscapes, numbers and thrilling experiences. It is a **reflection** of our World but we very much can become whatever we deem worth the efforts. Regardless what we achieve, it helps us grow and as such, I strongly encourage you to also rise to the challenge and let it improve your personnality, your qualities and your overall aspiration as a person.\n\nThat's what FFXIV means to me, it's a vessel that allows us to let our humanity shine. And so can you ! Let your humanity, in the best possible way, be your guiding light.",

So I guess to me it's just a comfortable medium to return to when I don't have much else going on in my life, or I've gotten bored of other games.\n\nI like the game and while I don't think it's *amazing,* sometimes all you need is a cozy fallback to lean on.",
            "FFXIV will always hold a special place in my heart. Back in 2013, I played it on a PS3 with my friends during our last 2 years in school. Ifrit gave us a hard/long time to complete (because we\u2019re dummies that didn\u2019t want to watch guides and never played MMOs). The game created unforgettable memories, I always look back at ffxiv and remember how much it actually means to me. \n\n\nCongrats to this sub for reaching 1mil!

How it's best to be cautious when letting people get close. How to handle trolls \ud83d\ude02\n\n\nBut the story has helped me as well.

I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ve been all these years, but coming to Xbox has brought me into a whole new world of possibilities I never thought I needed. I\u2019d spend hours just chatting with others, or exploring the world.

We played through ARR, did some of the old raids, but as with most things the guild fell off; people left.\n\nI've played solo for a long long time. The world itself has meaning to me. My apartment has a decoration given to me by an old friend and every time I log in I remember them.\n\nTo me it's just a beautiful world that, while I don't take an active part within the community, I get to sit back and watch the joy.

In FFXIV I didn't only level up jobs and conquered enemies, but I also leveled up myself.",
            "FFXIV has meant a lot of things over time to me.\n\nI remember hyping up my friends for 1.0 and playing the beta.  As a long time XI player, I was excited to journey into a new world.  I played through the game, despite its faults, and enjoyed it for what it was.\n\nWhen S-E announced a leadership change and this relatively \"unknown\" person named Naoki Yoshida was put in charge, I was extremely worried. But in a matter of months he earned the hope the very small community here had been feeling.\n\nBeing a part of the transformation and relaunch and seeing my name in the end credits of a Final Fantasy game as a Legacy member meant the absolute world to me.\n\nOver those next few years, with each expansion that hope and perseverance of the early days changed to excitement and dedication. Seeing this massive saga unfold in-game while having been through the very real-world game changing development is such a unique experience in an industry that sells unique experiences.\n\nThe friends and memories I have had since then have only continued to strengthen my feelings of the game.  I might take an occasional break to play other games, but I never go more than 1 or 2 months without logging in and playing, which usually leads to a full headfirst dive into the game again.\n\nCrazy to think that counting back to the announcement, it's been over 14 years of Final Fantasy 14 and looking forward to 14 more!",

We go on new adventures every day and it\u2019s been so amazing. We recently finished all the sight seeing logs (screw you ARR ones!). We are currently working on learning all the skills for blue mage, as we hope to explore beast master in Dawntrail. We enjoy mount farming and our main goal someday is to get as many achievements as we can. We both have 70% of the Triple Triad cards. We both get so angry at NPCs that cheat with multiple five star cards. We are excited to see what awaits us in Dawntrail and I\u2019ll have to find pictures of our adventures.

            "Looks like the same character from the drk job artwork",
            "Man I really want those drawings without the number on it.\nThose are sick!!!!",
            "strong Avan Strash energy in this one... now i kinda want that stance in game.",
            "I like the metal hearts on the skirt.",
            "I dunno why but my immediate thought was THE Zollton from NEST.",
            "The little serrations of the sides of the blade really ruin that weapon imo.",
            "I like the HW one it\u2019s mischievous little dude",
            "For a lalafel thats fucking sick the HW one",
            "Man, except the EW one, they are all so sick, especially the HW one",
            "Isn't it Sidurgu in both cases? (though I guess it's weird that only DRK is a specific npc so I could be wrong)",
            "Yeah, it's definitely channeling Sidurgu.",
            "Soul Crystal is shaped like a heart. Makes sense.",
            "Aren't those guitar picks? Jk",
            "Looks similar but I think this is some other male Au Ra Dark Knight. His hair is pink, his skin is darker and I think his eyes are blue instead of green. All of which could be put down to lighting or art style, but the main thing is the armour, which is completely different in both colour and details.",
            "Dark Knight is the magical girl job after all.\u00a0",
            "Plus they don't typically use in-game characters for the countdown arts. \n\nSometimes they will for the finale image like in SB and ShB but not in the countdown itself."
