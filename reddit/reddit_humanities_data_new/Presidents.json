            "I think Obama was an average to slightly above average president.\n\nHis presidency will always have historical significance which I think will usually bump him up in the rankings.\n\nI think his campaign promises were drastically different than what occurred in office, as is the case with many presidents. Hell, GWB mostly campaigned on education and look how that turned out.\n\nHe vowed to end the wars in the middle east. All he did was rename the operations from Iraqi Freedom to New Dawn and Enduring Freedom to Freedoms Sentinel. The Iraq withdrawal was already pretty much set in stone during the Bush Administration. He drastically increased the drone program which as far as reducing American casualties goes was a good thing. And as far as Afghanistan withdrawal I feel like the outcome would have been roughly the same regardless of what year it occurred. And he will forever have props for being the president during the raid that killed Bin Laden. And I feel like the launch of Operation Inherent Resolve was a smart move, keeping boots on the ground at a small number in a support and advisory capacity with minimal ground force involvement was a much better choice than another large scale return to Iraq and initial foray into Syria.\n\nHe navigated us somewhat out of a recession that most people don't feel we've ever fully come back from. \n\nObamacare had the potential to be landmark legislation that got bogged down with the end result being \"meh\"\n\nI feel like cutting NASA's budget was a mistake but I understand it may have been a necessary evil.\n \nAll in all I didn't feel like life was much different during the Obama administration than it was during the Bush administration. I think his foreign policy was much more hawkish than many will admit.His foreign policy was solid for the hand he was dealt with when he assumed office. And his domestic policy was neither detrimental nor anything to write home about. \n\nAnd I understand that much of what he may have wanted to accomplish was fought tooth and nail by his opponents. But at the end of the day when the history books are written, that will never be mentioned.\n\nAnd another bonus of his presidency was the Key and Peele skit with Obama and his anger translator.",
            "Aww, it's sad to see the end of this series. u/Hanhonhon 's answers were always my favourite part if this subreddit, a very informative and generally unbiased look that helped me form my own opinions. Thank you u/Hanhonhon, and to everyone else who engaged in these posts!",
            "Our economy was growing like 199-niiine, the crime rate came down for the first tiiime  \nFor the first time....\n\nFor the first time...\n\nGet it, get it.....\n\nOk, in actuality, TheoDonaldKerabatsos expounded on quite a bit of what Obama did so I won't try to echo here. It must be mentioned that the fact that he was the first black president must be taken into account regarding how far he could go and how extreme his policies could be. I don't want to give excuses on account of the incidence of his birth, but one who honestly studies history would be remiss if America's deep rooted racism did not hamstring how far Obama could go. What leniency he deservs for that I'm not going to attempt to answer, but this phenomenon is worth mentioning.\n\nNo doubt, his lasting legacies are the ACA and gay marriage (via his Supreme Court Justices). They have stood the test of time and despite a near decade long effort to repeal the ACA, has not been repealed. There is near universal agreement (for different reasons) that it must not be the end-all be-all for American healthcare, but it is a step along to whatever America comes up with. And no one since has been able to make the next step.\n\nAn unfortunate legacy was his inability to pull out of Afghanistan sooner after Osama Bin Laden was killed. That cannot be glossed over and he did kick the can to the two presidents after him. One can say that it was due to his over trusting of his military advisors or his need to adhere to some norm, but it cannot go without mentioning. Not to mention his ramping up of drone strikes which has been mentioned in other comment threads. All the surveillance bills that got passed in the wake of the Snowden affair was a chilling expansion of the Bush-era surveillance state that is still toxic to Americans to this day. Speaking of which, keeping Guantanamo open (despite ramping down operations), the desire to prosecute Snowden, and his policy of mass deportation leaves a black mark on his legacy as well.\n\nHis civility in the position is something that is still wanting in the American public. He generally owned his mistakes and even once said in an interview \"I screwed up.\" Unfortunately, his legacy should be viewed as thoroughly mixed and it's a shame that much of the criticisms levied against him were perfunctory (tan suit, dijon mustard, death panels) which robbed a lot of valid criticisms like the once mentioned above from truly being expounded upon in the public discourse. Personally, I see him as a B- president, because it's hard to shake the expansion of the surveillance state from his legacy, while at the same time the effect of the ACA should not be minimized.",
            "Very solid administration and he made major progress for the USA in many ways. I remember when I was 17 and the ACA finally passed, a new reform in healthcare. I remember that the economy was getting better in 2011, and how great things were going that year because it was the year Bin Laden was finally killed. Not to mention the ACA saved my family so much money because when my mom filed under it, we saved thousands in health insurance every year. I just kind of wish that he was a bit more assertive in his administration. You know push for more reform and everything else.",

            "Sadly I feel Obama\u2019s legacy will be mostly defined by his \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d feel between Dubya and Rule 3. Which will end up being a positive legacy, but it may lot invite as much nuanced discussion about what he did both well and poorly.\u00a0\n\nIt is extremely refreshing to listen to Obama\u2019s monologues and conversations now, he was mostly respected by people in both parties, he was willing to compromise to an extent to get things done, he was excellent at explaining his policy goals to the average American. An extremely charismatic leader and one of the most intelligent presidents of all time. What he represented for minorities as the first black man elected to office, without having grown up extremely privileged, can\u2019t be replicated. He did a lot of good to pull the United States back out of the Great Recession with Dodd-Frank, ARRA and other things, even if the recovery was slow and controlled. He fulfilled Bush\u2019s bumbled promise of retribution for 9/11, and he did a pretty good job managing the mess Bush and other administrations left him in foreign policy. Obamacare was largely a positive. He appointed Kagan and Sotomayer, he helped repeal DADT, and pushed to legalize gay marriage.\n\nHe does get criticism for mishandling the evolution of the Democratic Party through the end of his term, but it is not a very winnable war dealing with the vast partisan divide in the media in this day and age. But I feel time will only be kinder to Obama. He\u2019s the only president in my lifetime, within the rules, that I can unequivocally say I was proud of, and that I felt brought a true and earnest patriotism and care to the office. It\u2019s truly a shame and a major indictment on our current political/media climate that he was the prototypical new-generation president and neither party got the memo.\u00a0",

            "I thought he had a solid, above average administration. His administration was responsible for many victories (killing Bin Laden) and setting into motion some groundbreaking concepts like universal healthcare. I liked Obama's personality and character the most. He was open-minded, conscientious, and very emotionally stable, reminded me a lot of John F. Kennedy. Highly intelligent and educated, editor of Harvard Law Review, well-travelled and grew up in a very multicultural, United Nations-esque family. I definitely think he was the right man for the job at the time. Although I liked John McCain and his experience/character, after two terms of stagnant Republican administrations we needed someone new, with a totally different perspective. In the 21st-century it was also a significant, much-needed progress for us to get a qualified person in office who is African American. I think his greatest legacy will be the Affordable Healthcare Act, and as time goes on it will prove very monumental. I don't know much about misconceptions or where to find info, although his book \"Dreams From My Father\" might be a good place to start. Thank you for your legacy, President Obama!",

            "Bush's last year in office (2008) was the last time NASA's budget was at 0.60% of the Federal budget and even then he has already decreased their funding significantly compared to the numbers in his 1st term. Obama cut it down further by 0.10% in his first term and it's been floundering around 0.47\\~0.50% since then.",
            "I can't wait!",
            "I mean, in terms of political rhetoric and public image, I could easily agree with Bush being a conservative beacon of light between Clinton and Obama, although I don\u2019t feel Bush himself was as starkly different from both his predecessor and successor in terms of public persona and demeanor as Obama was. Disregarding policy, Bush was, and still is in some respects, seen as a normal, good-willed and level-headed conservative politician. As with the cyclical nature of what party is elected to the office of president in any given election, I can\u2019t deny that viewpoint exists for many earnest and honest Americans, in fact the conservative part of me agrees.\u00a0\n\nBut policy wise and within the context of the various time periods, it\u2019s not hard to argue that Obama brought a lot to the office of president that was absent during Bush\u2019s administration, and taken behind the woodshed after Obama left office. It\u2019s no secret that the economy was in terrible condition when Bush\u2019s second term ended (how much of that is attributed to him is a different matter entirely), and that most of the Obama years saw the economy consistently trending in the right direction. It\u2019s no secret that Bush made some horrifically misguided, or maybe even malicious, foreign policy decisions that Obama spent a great deal of his presidency trying to deal with, often with success. And even looking through the lens of a conservative, it\u2019s hard to see how anyone could think that Bush was a more intelligent person and even a remotely comparable orator to Obama.\u00a0\n\nThere are of course pros and cons to each, depending on who you ask. But generally, Obama fits the mold of a progressive president that is looked back on in hindsight with great reverence for what he represented, what he accomplished, and what state he left the nation in when he left office. At least more than Dubya, who was never all that remarkable or different compared to other conservative politicians in recent history aside from his lineage.\n\nAt the very least, the essence of my argument is that during the Obama years, I can\u2019t imagine re-evaluating the Bush years and seeing a significantly preferable political era, compared to re-evaluating Obama\u2019s term within the last 3 or 4 years.",
            "> Disregarding policy, Bush was, and still is in some respects, seen as a normal, good-willed and level-headed conservative politician. \n\nNot so. People hated Bush, compared him to Hitler, said he was a moron.",
            "Well that\u2019s a comparative description. I\u2019m saying in the grand scheme of the post-Reagan Republican Party, Bush wasn\u2019t very remarkable for one way or another. He was hated by the opposite end of the spectrum like all presidents. Obama wasn\u2019t exactly the most effective or significant president of his time, either. I just think hindsight will be kinder to him because his values, goals, accomplishments, demeanor and rhetoric during his presidency will be compared to the republican presidents he\u2019s sandwiched between.\n\nHowever, I will say there have been very few presidents in recent history to reap the benefits of revisionist history so quickly like George W. Bush. In my opinion, he was a firmly below-average president, but his boring and vanilla nature is probobly a huge benefit given other significant GOP figures before and after him.\u00a0",
            "The problem is that I've seen that cycle repeat with every Republican president since Nixon. Reagan was called worse than Nixon until he left office, then W Bush was called worse than Reagan, and the next Republican president was called worse than W.

            "Hot take, I'm going to pick a president I wouldn't save. And that's JFK. HERE ME OUT. I think Kennedy was definitely one of the better presidents in the 20th century for sure, peace corps is probably the greatest accomplishment he made. Plus his handling of the Cuban missile crisis was pretty good, showing that he learned from his mistakes during the bay of pigs invasion. Also kept a decently level head during the checkpoint Charlie standoff. \n\nBut I wouldn't save him because if he had lived and likely been re-elected in 1964, his legacy would be remembered much less fondly (in my opinion). Kennedy's attempts to try and get a civil rights bill through Congress likely gets watered down or not even passed at all. Lyndon Johnson was probably the only person up to the job to get a civil rights bill through considering he was JFK's VP and had HUGE influence in the senate. The combination of the collective mourning of the nation plus Johnson's cunning made the civil rights possible (once again, in my opinion). \n\nHad JFK lived, he likely would've done much the same as Johnson did in Vietnam, escalating the conflict by sending thousands of troops to reinforce the south Vietnamese. Kennedy would have received the same backlash as Johnson did during his presidency OTL. Plus this could even squander a potential Bobby Kennedy presidential campaign or even just screw over the entire Kennedy family in general politically. \n\nKennedy I feel is remembered so fondly because on his shortened time in office, he did mostly good things. He died a martyr of the nation, a symbol of the times before the turbulent late 60s. I love Kennedy because he was a dreamer that inspired others to sometimes literally, reach for the stars. He has such Charisma that even 60 years later we mostly see him as one of the greats. \n\nSo yeah, I wouldn't save Kennedy, I'd probably save old Abe or something.",

He would've been better than Johnson, definitely, but it's the same reason Kennedy ranks so high. America loved them and they had potential that we never got to see. That doesn't mean stuff won't get in the way. We like to think that if x happened everything would change, but the president is 1/3 of Congress. What if Lincoln loses interest in reconstruction? I like the idea of WHH simply because a third party would be nice, although that could mean no future Republican party. I feel most modern people would be unsatisfied with what Lincoln would likely accomplish, he wasn't a saving grace, and throughout the war he slowly gave more and more freedoms to black individuals. Frederick Douglass had to keep nagging him to let blacks serve for the union.",

JFK died right before many issues came to a head and his term wasn\u2019t put up for review. His two years had been two years of gridlock, as no major legislation was passed, but much was proposed. Even with major public support for bills such as the Revenue Act of 1964 didn\u2019t get it voted on. FDR, if he lived, would\u2019ve been practically dead. For him to have lived, it\u2019s just complete different than just him living, but also being in good enough help to function another four years. Even with Roosevelts name and his well established agenda and record, Congress probably only passes watered down versions of his proposals, though still significant. Garfield is just another Gilded Age president, as his death actually greatly helped pass the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act.

Sure, FDR had a better relationship with Stalin, but it's not like he was a Communist sympathizer.\n\nI hate to be that guy, but the United States ended up in the better timeline with Taylor, Garfield, McKinley, Harding, and JFK dying. Garfield's assassination gave some much needed momentum for civil service reform and ending the spoils system. Teddy Roosevelt put America on a much more progressive path than the pro-business puppet McKinley. LBJ was a much more effective politician than JFK. We would have had less effective civil rights legislation and we certainly wouldn't have gotten the Great Society, all while still getting mucked up in Vietnam. Coolidge is a better President than Harding. And Taylor dying finally made everyone realize that maybe the White House should get a sewer system instead of killing Presidents with cholera.\n\nProbably save Lincoln and Harrison.

            "1. Lincoln got the civil war and slavery job done but his death left the task of black integration and southern reconstruction in the hands of men who lacked the balls/compassion/skills to successfully implement these things. Grant might be the only one to have the balls and heart, but his administration straight up Dick Cheney\u2019d him.\n\n* 2. Kennedy made mistakes, but Ive always seen him as a fairly quick (and flexible) learner with good intentions and a certain shrewd, ruthless political instinct. JFK is tough to rank regarding the impact of his death; on one hand, his death may have helped accelerate civil rights via national sympathy and LBJ\u2019s prowess in wrangling congress. On the other hand, JFK might have avoided Vietnam and still gotten civil rights through. \n\n* 3. Garfield is seen as a man who had the skills and ideals to be a top 10 president, but sadly we were robbed of seeing that. It\u2019s hard to measure \u201cwhat if\u201d for a man who was mostly potential; some folks thought Obama was a Garfield-level prospect and while he did fine as president, he\u2019s probably not top five/ten even for democrats. Still, Garfield was chosen on the convention floor for a reason - he was believed to have what it takes to be great. If someone ran as a candidate who would \u201cjust ask what Garfield would do\u201d, you\u2019d probably find yourself liking said candidate.\n\n* 4. FDR got the WW2 job largely done and left the remaining task of Japan and the Cold War to someone capable in Harry Truman and later in Dwight Eisenhower. Hard to explicitly see how FDR would improve the next decade. I think most people who would argue FDR would be those who believe that FDR wouldn\u2019t have used the bomb and would have kept the Cold War from escalating to things like the Korean War etc. Personally I think FDR was done by 1945; he dedicated himself to beating the nazis and his ability to counter Stalin/Mao and the USSR/China would be limited.",

            "In Harry turtledove\u2019s southern victory timeline Lincoln becomes party chair of the socialist party and his being a former president legitimizes socialism in the US in a way it hadn\u2019t previously been(and still hasn\u2019t been in the current reality) and the socialists emerge in the 20th century as the major left party in the US and the democrats remain right of center instead.",
            "The parties realigned. And in the period following Reconstruction, the Republicans were basically the party of John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan.",
            "This would\u2019ve been an interesting idea and it\u2019s tough to say how things might have changed after Lincoln had he survived. I\u2019ve been studying the two political parties for a while and there\u2019s been one major, steady theme among republicans basically the entirety of their existence: support for free market capitalism. This is why the party was never 100% abolitionist, but was willing to provide a home for abolitionists: slavery is an unfair competitive advantage to slave holders because the market isn\u2019t free, and it discourages industrialization, which puts the US at a disadvantage against Europe. \n\nLincoln himself was not a staunch abolitionist but more of a pragmatist who did not see slavery\u2019s value. Much like many other presidents, his views evolved and I think everyone knows Reconstruction would\u2019ve gone differently - and likely for the better - had he survived. \n\nBut what we see happen over the half century after Lincoln is a sharpening of focus on free market/deregulation and the corruption of the gilded age arises largely because victory during Civil War put R\u2019s in a very strong position to maintain power (power corrupts, etc). There\u2019s one Democratic president between Johnson and Wilson, and Congress has a similar Republican dominance during this 4-decade period. This is where Republican core ideas really sharpen themselves until basically through the W Bush administration. (The southern strategy and alliance with religious conservatism comes a century later under Nixon as a way to shore up votes for an increasingly unpopular party focused largely on free market capitalism)\n\nMuch like how abolitionists had an alliance of convenience with republicans before the civil war, civil rights activists had an alliance of convenience with democrats afterward. Socialists, pro-union groups, and workers rights advocates naturally needed a champion and with only two real parties, it made sense to ally with the party who was in opposition to unregulated capitalism.\n\nSo what you get in Democrats is an interesting dichotomy of northern liberal democrats who attract not just workers rights activists but also women\u2019s rights activists, along with southern democrats who\u2026 kind of just hate the republicans who won the war but aren\u2019t necessarily interested in racial or gender equality. But many of these southern democrats are also poor, uneducated, at a disadvantage from unregulated industry, so there\u2019s a lot of intermingling of ideas. It\u2019s an opposition party basically until about Wilson\u2019s time. \n\nFor people like Lincoln, ending slavery was good for business. I think it would have taken a very specific effort to bring socialist ideas into the Republican Party and I\u2019m not sure Lincoln would\u2019ve gone that far, nor that Congress would\u2019ve supported him beyond efforts to boost racial equality as an effort to boost economic activity. \n\nThen again, we really get into unknown what-if\u2019s in a history where Lincoln is not assassinated: how strongly does Reconstruction continue? How much does the federal government actually push to stamp out confederate ideas and push racial equality when it was only nominally popular with most Americans at the time? Does segregation take hold anyway? Or do we continue to see more black politicians and empowered black voters?",

Both he and AJ were in the \"go easy\" camp.\n\nIt is safe to say that Reconstruction would not have been the shit show that it was under AJ, but it is pretty clear that sharecropping was the destination for the freedmen under either man.\n\nWe need to keep in mind that a big reason for this is that both Abe and AJ knew how violent things would become if civil rights for the freedmen was forced onto the defeated White south. Abe wanted an end to violence above all else, hence the ten percent plan and an easy path back for the former Confederates. Johnson was of the same mind.",
