The first impression will be excellent if you take good care of patients by asking them questions when you're uncertain. The only way to ruin a first impression in residency is to not ask questions when you have them. If you are considered an unsafe resident, that label will follow you for your entire residency.\n\nThink of it this way: as a chief I am very comfortable when an intern is on overnight who I know will ask questions when needed. I sleep very well. The interns who are too self-conscious to ask questions, that's when I get nervous and chart check from home at regular intervals and don't get much sleep. They scare me. The ones who wake me up all the time to ask questions are the ones I trust.\n\nYour attending will sleep soundly at night if they know you will ask questions when you have them."

Confused, an EM resident told her that tonight\u2019s medical student was already here - surely a scheduling mistake. He gestured to a young man in a short white coat with the school\u2019s patch on it. She stared at him closely for a moment then said, \u201cHe\u2019s not a med student. He doesn\u2019t go to this school.\u201d Cue anxious whispering. I hadn\u2019t worked with him, but I turned my attention to his fit: school logo was a patch, not embroidered, badge was fake, etc. He had been in the ED seeing patients and telling people he was in med school both at the hospital and in his personal life. The (real) med students later showed me screenshots from his Facebook page showing him posing in a long white coat, bogus transcripts that nobody who went to med school would ever think were real, photos in the ED with patient info/scans visible, and saying he was a \u201ctrauma surgery intern\u201d whatever that means as a med student.

No one seemed to recognize her, but mind you, there were a lot of travelers on any given unit during COVID and this was a massive county hospital. \n\nOur professor dismissed us for lunch and I came back to a fully locked-down unit, with security standing guard, police at the nurses\u2019 station interviewing my preceptor who was in tears. \n\nApparently, that woman went into a patient room on postpartum and told the parents that she was taking their baby for \u201ca CT scan to check his brain\u201d. \n\nThe baby was as healthy as they come so the parents were understandably confused and started asking a bunch of questions. The \u201cnurse\u201d panicked and left. We later found out it was a random person trying to steal a baby from the hospital.

Cheerful, smart, athletic, travelled a lot despite not being rich, beautiful but never shallow, very charismatic, friendly, \u2026 except she was starting her year over and over again but kept failing very badly. At some point though, it became clear that she was pathologically lying to everyone about nearly everything in her life. It apparently culminated with pretending to be a doctor in order to advise a cancer patient to refuse her chemo, in order to make herself look smart. University stopped accepting her so she moved to another country to start again.",

I can't remember exactly, but i think the guy told the security guard he forgot the staff card and he was given a temp card (major security issue, I know). He ended up walking around the wards for 3 days and even used a stethoscope to examine a patient and called their family. It was until on the third day he tried chatting with some interns and was noted to be utterly incompetent. He was arrested in the end. Turns out he had some medical knowledge and studied up to preclinical years in some overseas med school. Not sure if he is mentally ill or anything or what happened to him afterwards but that definitely boosted the security level of hospitals around here.",

Someone dug into her background and posted a reveal. She actually *had* been a medical student but had been kicked out after failing her step exam too many times, then she spent years and years trying to get into another medical school.

            "We had one at my medical school back in 2014! That was when we had all started our first year and the hustle bustle of beginning med school was always in the air. We were all so excited and nervous! Orientation classes, ethics class, and everyone was in the bookstore buying our supplies and tools like stethoscopes. We went to go get our stuff in groups like white coats and school swag. We got our badges. \n\nThe whole time there was a short black guy with us (I think I remember he had some kind of accent?) that blended in really well and he was excited too. We all just thought he was one of us!  I don\u2019t know how they figured it out, but eventually about 2-3 weeks in, there was a whole scene and he was apprehended by police as an imposter! He has been posting on social media that he was a med student, had taken photos of orientation, somehow I think he got a white coat. We were all pretty shocked. \n\nAlso side note one year there was a 3rd or 4th year med student who was expelled after she stole an iPad from an elderly patient that passed away. Her family had specifically been looking for the iPad because there were lots of family photos on there. Said med student forgot that Apple products can be tracked back to her home! She had even tried to change the name of the iPad to her own, which helped their criminal case as well that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\nAnyone who went to my school will immediately know from the above stories!!

He managed to enter the ER and find a PC that a real resident forgot to log off. He discharged a bunch of people. I don\u2019t remember how he was caught - I had already graduated and followed the case most through gossip and the local newspaper. He got arrested. And he said he did it because he was a grey\u2019s anatomy fan.\nThe real resident that forgot to log off was suspended (don\u2019t remember clearly if expelled too)",

The medical student gave him there ID badge and told them how to get into theatre's. \n\nHe ended up scrubbed helping in the operation. The surgeon asked him what he wanted to do in medicine later on- the idiot then said he was a builders apprentice and not a medical student. \n\nHuge deal, the medical student got kicked out.

        "content": "Hello friends! I'm finally at the finish line of 9 years of training and SO thankful that it's over.\n\n**First - I'm going to insert my rant**:\n\nOver the last two years of speciality training, the number of times I've wanted to pull my hair out from the phone calls at night.. \"We wanted to make you aware of this patient.\" (For no particular reason other than they get chronic dialysis). \"I need urgent dialysis on this patient\" (Call at 10PM for labs that returned at 6AM). Other \\*clearly\\* non urgent consults at 3AM. Most specialities take home call. This doesn't mean I'm at home, peacefully sleeping in my bed and also get a post-call day after. It means I just finished a 10-12 hour day. Am now having disrupted sleep and still have to work the next 10-12 hours tomorrow. Calls that may seem harmless are not innocuous. I've had 30+ pages in one night. I cannot always fall right back asleep after getting paged. I know that often attendings will make ya'll call but please be the absolute most mindful as possible. If you must call, please be as prepared as humanly possible, know exactly what you're consulting for and ALWAYS speak to your attending before you call me. Particularly in the world of nephrology, I'm frequently consulted by residents for very clear IM issues that do not require speciality level knowledge. Ie - Your attending should be able to answer if your patient needs a bicarb drip.\n\n**Now onto other things:**\n\nNo matter where you are in your training, there are times you are going to want to quit. This job is going to burn you out. Just know that it is (unfortunately) normal and don't be afraid to ask for help. I have gone to therapy throughout the entirety of my training and wouldn't have done it any other way. If you need a break or more sleep, say you need it. No one will advocate for yourself other than you. Do not skip doctor's appointments. Your attendings can be as grumpy about it as they want but ACGME protects trainees. ACGME clearly states in their policies that trainees are allowed to sleep if needed, leave work if they feel they are not able to practice medicine and attending all doctor's appointments. If they say no, report them. Do NOT neglect yourself in an environment where we are brainwashed to think this is normal. You're not a champion for making yourself suffer. The only one that loses is you. Check in with yourself as much as you can.\n\nAlways, alway, always be nice to nurses. Sometimes it can be tough as a trainee because the nurses can be particularly cruel at times. I've experienced more abuse as a female trainee from nurses (not all of them) than my male colleagues. Try to shake it off as best you can because they will make your life harder if you're not. Also, just make sure you're treating other colleagues as good humans in general.\n\nDon't allow any staff to be creepy with you. You are supposed to be feel safe in your work space. GME is there if you need help with this. \n\nYou're going to make mistakes and it's okay. Own it. DO NOT hide it. It will make everything worse if you do.\n\nStart training with little expectations of yourself. You didn't finish medical school one day and then suddenly know all of internal medicine (or whatever residency) on day 1 of residency. Sometimes it might feel like other people around you know more than you. They might, they might not. They may also never sleep or have insane anxiety. Don't compare. You're not inferior or inadequate. We all have strengths and weaknesses. Just try to fill in your own gaps. \n\nMake a support system. Training is one of the few times in life that you sort of have built in friends. Everyone is going through the same struggle. In residency, I always prioritized sleep over social interaction and doing fun things. In fellowship, I learned it's better and healthier to strike a balance.\n\nExercise and eat as best you can. But do NOT pressure yourself or make yourself feel guilty because you're not able to stick to a work out schedule or eat perfectly healthy. It's not reasonable or realistic. Congrats to those who can do it but I find that most of us can't and beating yourself up over it is a waste of time.\n\nTry to maintain contact with family if you're able. There's definitely a balance to strike here because family can also be stressful. I can't speak to what it's like to have children in training and I'm endlessly impressed by those who do. I had days where I was lucky if I did dishes. \n\nLastly, and I cannot say this enough.. **be kind to yourself**. You are doing YOUR best, whatever that looks like.\n\nGood luck everyone out there!",

Generally speaking I don\u2019t expect neuro or OB or surgery etc to know basically anything about my subspecialty and I\u2019m just glad if they think to call me. Medicine is different. COPD exacerbation is in the top 5 admitting diagnoses in every hospital ever for a medicine service and if you are a board certified internist having to page me at 2am to tell you to give prednisone 40mg I\u2019m gonna find it hard to filter the disappointment. Similarly \u201chey just paging so it\u2019s in your list to see in the morning\u201d is kinda annoying because you could just.. wait until the morning? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge ask to request that people stop and think if their question is urgent before calling. If that\u2019s in question? Fair game please call.\n\nI am no stranger to nights and obviously picked a field where a lot of places I\u2019m going to be in house a chunk of nights. I will say for Pulm that actually makes dumber home pages feel worse.

            "I think there's some misinterpretation here. I don't expect a surgeon to know indications for most renal related things. It's not in your training and that would be an unrealistic ask. Nor do I ever want patient care to be compromised. I do expect internal medicine residents to speak with their attendings who know basic internal medicine before they call me in the middle of the night. It is literally within their training. An intern should be running things up the chain before making me their first call. If after that, they need to phone a friend, I'm all ears. I'd like to remind you that every time I am woken up (as you are), it is opening up opportunities for poor patient care the following day due to physician fatigue. I am more than capable of understanding that there are times where patient care supersedes my wants or needs. I'm not really sure the value of telling someone to \"get off their high horse\" but thanks for your thoughts.",

She may also talk about medicine a lot as it\u2019s what she will be thinking about 24/7. I sometimes feel bad for non-medical SOs when I\u2019m out with friends/colleagues, lol.

There may be some days where she literally doesn\u2019t have the energy to do anything besides lie in bed.\n* Inpatient months will be the worst for her.
