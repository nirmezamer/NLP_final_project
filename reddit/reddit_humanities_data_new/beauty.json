            "That's fair, I've been seeing a lot on this sub myself. Maybe to help those looking for tips, you could pin a glow-up mega thread to the sub's page or add a page that has a few links to the most popular glow up discussions on the sub. Maybe have automod automatically pin those to posts or add those to the disclaimers people see while making a post. Maybe that will help cut down on the clutter.",
            "Thank you, it\u2019s such spam- I don\u2019t mind helping or giving advice to people but- I see posts with no context or where to even begin with where they are looking for improvements. Nothing to make the post unique  to discuss.",
            "Can posts about how hard it is to be beautiful also be banned?",
            "I\u2019m annoyed that the term \u201cglow up\u201d has replaced \u201cmakeover\u201d, when that\u2019s exactly what it is. I don\u2019t know about anyone else, but my psyche has had the makeover mentality so deeply etched since\u2014I don\u2019t know, probably when I saw the Princess Diaries at the movies when I was six\u2014that I\u2019m constantly looking at parts of myself that if I could just fix right now, everything in my life would get better. God, it\u2019s so fucking exhausting. \n\nThe insidious part of calling it a \u201cglow up\u201d though, is that while these improvements are totally based on appearance, the idea is if you make yourself look better, you\u2019re also growing as a person or like, getting your shit together to be a prettier, more productive cog in the capitalist machine. \n\nIt\u2019s never just, \u201cwear these eyeshadow colors to make your eyes POP\u201d anymore; it\u2019s \u201cget up at five am, take a freezing cold shower to increase your alertness, put on *sponsored workout gear* and workout while listening to *girlboss podcast*, then drink *sponsored laxative tea*, and spend the next two hours meditating on the toilet while listing everything you\u2019re grateful for and your *goals* for the week, then take another shower with *sponsored skin and hair care products*, then put on your 12 step skincare routine, blow out your hair with the *DYSON AIRWRAP* for that 90\u2019s supermodel look, then put on just enough makeup to look like a *clean girl* who gets the promotions at work and does not report sexual harassment, then spritz on the SCENTBIRD perfume of the week and hope no one in the office is allergic to it, and get dressed in sad beige business casual dress available for purchase in the TikTok shop, and DON\u2019T forget your collagen-spiked latte and overnight oats and *sponsored vitamin and mineral supplements*!",

The same questions over and over again with absolutely no effort to do some research on their own, or really any awareness of what issue(s) they\u2019re looking to solve.  Unfortunately those subs haven\u2019t banned these type of posts, so daily there\u2019s at least 1-3 clueless posts.  At least the mods in this sub have banned them, good job!",

            "The thing is they\u2019re actually already pretty and they\u2019re posting that like what you just NEED to see yourself from different eyes because how can you be an Adriana Lima yet ask this and we\u2019re sitting there like um \ud83d\ude00",

            "Hi there! Looks like Reddit flagged it as spam for some reason, and that's why it wasn't visible. I've approved it for you :)",
            "As per this very post, they clog up the sub (while adding less and less to the general conversation, because people stop answering - how many times can you type up the same few things over and over again?) There's usually 1-3 of them every single week. Search for \"glow up\" in the sub search bar, and see for yourself. It's always the same thing, with a few variations (glow up for moms, glow up for student, glow up for depression, glow up on a budget, glow up on high budget, glow up megathread). Which, we get it, some people feel the need for this. But it's already there, asked and answered literally dozens of times over.\u00a0\n\n\nPersonally, another reason why the deluge irked me, aside from laziness and the utter refusal to use existing resources, is the very strong feeling that these posts are masking other issues in the users who post them. I might petition the mods to write up a post about that some time soon, but in short, the sheer number and repetitive nature of them makes me feel like there's something toxic about this \"glow-up culture\", and it's actually hurting people even though they think it's benign or helping.\u00a0",
            "NAM: Because there are upteen of them every day/week ( slight exaggeration..but that is what it feels like), the same tips apply nearly every time, and it isn't that difficult to use the search function in the sub..",

            "Per Rule 1, if you are asking about a specific beauty-related problem, it should be OK.   \n\n\nOn the other hand, if you just sail in to the sub asking vague, open-ended generic questions like \"How do I glow up? \u2728\", that's going to be removed.",
            "Without seeing the photo, it's hard to say, but if it's just an attention-seeking \"look at me\" type of photo, then it will likely be removed. Please see Rule 1 regarding the type of posts we allow, and let us know if you have additional questions!",
            "No, that's not really what we are talking about in most cases. We don't want low effort \"how can I glow up?\" generic posts that leave it to other users to do all the work. \"Glow up\" is a problematic concept anyway, whereas asking for hairstyle tips is less self-disparaging.   \n  \nIf someone has a specific question, like \"which style looks better on me?\", that's probably fine. We want posts to be interesting to our users and to spark good discussions, and lazy posts don't contribute toward that goal.   \n  \nWe feel that the sub's members agree with us, based upon how many reports we always get on the \"glow up\" requests along with the comments by users under this very post.",
            "Depression and body dysmorphia are way outside the scope of this sub, which (I think) is part of why these posts aren\u2019t allowed. In those cases, giving superficial beauty advice won\u2019t help the person (and could even hurt them in the latter case) until they address the underlying problem. The actual \u201cglow up\u201d subs on Reddit are known for being very toxic places and I can understand why that energy isn\u2019t wanted here.",
            "Because they're extremely vague and there's an excessive amount of them. They just get the same 3 answers because there's not really anything else you can say. The examples you provided are more specific and are generally going to be better  than just the constant vague posts that only say \"How do I glow up?\"",
            "Thank you so much!",
            "Agreed! Honestly, the saturation of those posts has turned this sub into a dysmorphia circle jerk. I know the people posting them don\u2019t have bad intentions\u2026 but when they are this repetitive and pervasive\u2026 it\u2019s literally dangerous. We\u2019re normalizing self-hate on a daily basis. Not good. Maybe an automated response with mental health resources or something could help.",
            "I agree... I've started to really dislike the \"glow up\" craze, for so many reasons. \n\nOne... most of the time it's like... why do you even need a \"glow up?\" You look fine! \n\nAnd two... if you really want to make changes... make slow, sustainable changes. Don't try to \"glow up\" over night. Why are you going from \"no skincare routine\" to \"12 steps?\" Maybe start with moisturizer and go from there. You're going to break out and it's not going to be a \"glow up\" anyway. \n\nAnd three... there's only so much advice you can get. If you want to have a \"glow up,\" then pinpoint specifically where you need help and ask that question. Because if you're not being specific, there's only so many times people are going to say \"drink more water... eat healthy... exercise... wear sunscreen... do a skincare routine... learn to do hair and makeup that suits you... dress for your body.\"",
            "Yeah the pressure lately to continuously \u201cglow up\u201d is so freaking stressful. It is so frequently an already pretty-but-low-maintenance 20-something losing their baby fat and upping their physical maintenance so they look comparatively striking in their 30s.\n\nNearing my 30s it\u2019s already on my mind that I am beginning to look distinctly different from my younger self but now the expectation is I need to look *even more conventionally attractive?!*",

We seek help.   \n\"drink more water... eat healthy... exercise... wear sunscreen...\" These things are a given and require discipline.  \n  \nIt's the other things that you mention that I think people want to understand how to do. No matter how many times I read about it, I cannot figure out if I am a soft summer or soft autumn. I have blue veins and am pulled to colors on the blue spectrum but have many traits of an autumn. I have no idea what hairstyle suits me best. Everytime I go to a stylist, they either want to know exactly what I want or say OK and just try whatever new thing they have been wanting to try regardless of if it's best for me. I just can't see what others see so easily. My brain isn't wired that way, but I do want to look the best that I can. I'm just not sure how.   \n  \nAnyway, maybe they are just lost and looking for some help.",
            "I feel like a lot of the harmful mentality behind the seemingly benign obsession with \"glowing up\" comes from this way of framing it: as a \"level-up\". You have to up your game, or you're falling behind. Behind what? Says who? No one knows, but the pressure is there. And it only gets bigger, because guess what, the spiral never ends. People start to feel like more and more is demanded of them for just a basic level of being \"put together\". God forbid they jump off the escalator, though.\u00a0",

They jumped off the escalator. \n\nNow I\u2019m more frequently seeing \u201cI am happy because I am objectively hotter now at 42 than 22 and I owe it to (spending copious amounts of time and money on my appearance)!\u201d \ud83d\ude22",

Although it\u2019s natural, I feel like it\u2019s doing a number in her confidence. I try to give her compliments often to try to build her up, in particular when she\u2019s undressed, and during sex, to give her that kind of reassurance. But I feel like she thinks I\u2019m doing it out of obligation. \n\nOne thing I\u2019ve started doing is taking photos of her when I think she\u2019s looking particularly sexy, and sending them to her, as \u201cproof.\u201d This has helped a little! But overall I want to help her feel better about all of this, since we will obviously be aging for the rest of our lives.\n\nAny advice would be helpful. \n",

            "It's nice you want to help her. I'm in my 40s and here are my thoughts.\n\nI don't mean to sound critical but when women are terrified of aging it's because of their own internalized ageism. She thinks only young women are beautiful. This means she doesn't notice the beauty in older women at all. She thinks they look worse than younger women so of course this extends to herself. She has to confront her own prejudice in order to eliminate the self hatred. I'm not sure how a husband can bring this up delicately, lol, it's like tightrope walk. But that's why your reassurance is only going so far and why she doesn't believe you when you reassure her. SHE doesn't think women in their 40s or 50s are beautiful. She has drunk the marketing nonsense and believes it.\n\nI surround myself with fashion inspiration of women older than me. Advanced Style is excellent. There are also several youtube channels that feature street fashion in major cities like Milan, Tokyo, etc. and they often include people of all ages. I do not look at any content featuring women in their 20s or 30s as it is wholly inapplicable to me. I have no use for it. When I look at an absurdly glamorous 60 year old woman, in beautiful clothes who is laughing with her head thrown back the last thing I think is, \"look at the quality of her skin compared to a 20 year old.\" If you objectify women you see them as parts and not a whole. She's missing the beauty which is found in the whole. She doesn't do this when she looks at you, which is why your aging doesn't bother her.\n\nDoes your wife have any friends who are older than her and who are happy? One of my best friends is 20 years older than me and she is a great example of living the good life. Happiness is positively enticing at any age. Beauty is seeing the whole person. Their laugh, their voice, how they make you feel. Marketing brainwashes women to look at women like parts. How smooth is their skin? How much cellulite? How tight is the jawline? She has to stop seeing other women that way to stop seeing herself that way.",
            "Honestlyyyy i think its something everyone goes through and its a internal battle. I would just keep complimenting her, taking nice photos of her. Complimenting her to other people (infront of her)",
            "there\u2019s this book i read in high school where the character reconnects with the love interest of his youth, once they\u2019re both middle aged.   he describes her as having a more developed beauty, and finds her more attractive than ever.  their romance made me feel a lot better about the idea of growing old and losing my youthful beauty.  i wonder if she would benefit from reading that book, it\u2019s called \u201cbrideshead revisited\u201d",
            "This is a tough one, I think you are doing all the right things. Ultimately this is on her to figure out and work on. Do you all spend enough time together? Maybe it\u2019s time to find a new hobby to explore together? As I near 40 I find spending more time in nature appreciating the small things and trying new hobbies takes my mind off of the other stuff like aging \ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. I also try to remind myself that the 20 something\u2019s around me will all be aging eventually one day too as I was their age once lol. We all need to find & appreciate who we are at our given age. At 50 & 60 and so on we will also look different so try to enjoy the journey gracefully.",
            "This is really sweet of you, but I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s much you can do to help. You can certainly help her to prioritize things she wants to do to take care of herself, whether that\u2019s fitness or skincare or spa treatments or whatever. If her thoughts are truly becoming distracting to the point where she\u2019s depressed or unable to focus on normal tasks, however, then the best thing you can do is encourage her to get into therapy. She may also want to see her doctor to have her hormone levels checked. Perimenopause can do a number on your emotional state, and plenty of women start feeling its effects in their late 30s and early 40s. \n\nFor perspective, I\u2019m also 40 (with a 46yo husband) and I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s extraordinarily preoccupied with \u201clooking old.\u201d Sure, there are some things I miss about looking young, but there are also many ways in which I much prefer being 40 to being 20 or 25. My friends and I have talked many times about how the wisdom, confidence, and feeling of comfort in your own skin that you experience in your 40s are well worth a few wrinkles and grey hairs. I certainly feel better at 40 than I did in my 30s with babies messing up my body and monopolizing every ounce of energy I had. \n\nIt\u2019s perfectly fine if your wife hasn\u2019t found the joy of 40 yet (although I hope she does!) but there\u2019s definitely a line between a preoccupation and a fixation. If you\u2019re concerned, I\u2019d definitely suggest she start by seeing her doctor.",
            "You\u2019re a wonderful husband! \n\nAt 69 years old, I remain grateful that I was never a raving beauty. I am cross-eyed by birth. Have facial scars due to both clumsiness from right-eye blindness and skin cancer scars. Yet, I remain relatively happy with my\nLooks because all that  makes me.\n\nKeep telling her that she\u2019s always going to be beautiful but in a different and mature way. Explain to her aging is a privilege.",
            "When I started perimenopause, started to _feel_ old. Yes, the loss in estrogen caused some jaw sagging, but there was also an overwhelming feeling of being an empty old husk whose life was essentially over. It was hormonal.\n\nHRT has helped _a lot_. I feel much more like myself and that overwhelming feeling is gone",
            "I haven\u2019t read many other comments, but IMO, if I was overwhelmingly feeling like I looked old and my hubby recommended working out or taking supplements, I\u2019d probably be offended. I can\u2019t explain it myself, but I\u2019d feel that\u2019s what it would trigger. Maybe because it would make me feel even older? \n\nHave you thought about couples therapy? Getting older is a huge transition, especially when she begins menopause and stuff. There also may be deeper issues that is rearing its head in the form of self consciousness about her looks with age. I think therapy would be wonderful for her to give a try, and you alongside her sometimes so that it can be a safe space for her to fully express and vent her emotions and thoughts. And for you to, as well. \n\nI hope everything works out! Unfortunately your efforts are seeming to fall on ears deafened with overwhelming insecurity. I applaud you for that, it\u2019s just that it takes a heellllll of a lot of effort to find what is going to get through to someone struggling with themselves. I wish you both all the best, and you\u2019re a good hubby",
            "I love this!! A few other options: \n\n\\* Give her flowers weekly \"just because\" \n\n\\* Call her beautiful and specifically say what you like about her in the moment. Love that you're doing that in front of other people too \n\n\\* (hear me out) Comment on how young people in media seem... young. Nothing wrong with them of course, but from experience, hearing how your husband views young people is huge. Especially combined with your existing comments on how beautiful she is \n\n\\* Notice anything she's been doing to change her appearance and comment on anything you specifically think compliments her \n\n\\* Take her to an art museum and point out how the classics look like her. One big confidence boost I do is look at classical pieces of art and realize that all the beautiful women there have bellies and soft bodies. It's such a change from social media these days and those artists really committed to showing soft bodies as the peak of beauty for all of history to remember",
            "This might sound weird, but this guy I dated once did this and it unexpectedly made my day! \nWhen you\u2019re out, tell her you caught some guy checking her out, and then act a bit protective, defensive. It was sexy as hell, and who knows if it was true or not haha.",

            "You\u2019re doing great! One idea is a bit more money-oriented, but bear with me. Personally feeling pampered makes me feel pretty. The question then is what aspect makes her feel most beautiful?\n\n- She could **update her wardrobe** with some items that make her feel sexy and give her a reason to wear them out (or stay in \ud83d\ude0f).\n- You two could have a monthly date to get a **couples massage** or your nails done together (I know someone who does this w/his girlfriend).\n- Perhaps a **new hairstyle** would make her feel refreshed. Groupon is great for trying something new at a much lower cost.\n-  Individually or together you could sign up for a **fitness class**. Dancing together like swing or tango can be great bonding with longterm impact. Or she could find that fire within from a kickboxing or yoga class. \n- If her concern is facial wrinkles / skin texture then a visit to the Derm or gifting a Red Light Therapy Mask would get her towards her goals of being her *best self*.\n\nI list a few things because I do think it matters why she feels less beautiful as she ages. Sometimes it\u2019s as simple as finding trendy clothes and getting them tailored whereas others may be wanting that experience that makes them feel empowered in their beauty.",

            "Idk how much you can influence her in this regard but it\u2019s nice to develop an interest or activity at this age like running, weightlifting or horseback riding because you develop a new relationship with your body, and respect it. Also when you\u2019re in a charity 5k and you pass all the teenagers who don\u2019t run regularly it\u2019s a great boost! Sure they have youth but technique is more important in the long run",

            "Compliments/photoshoots don't create self esteem in others. It can allow them to feel safe around you and validated in that fleeting moment but an outside source can't really repair deep seeded insecurity. It's something she'll have to find on her own. Does she practice self care? Like, eating healthy, exercise, therapy, skin care, flattering clothes, yoga, stretching? These would certainly help because it's putting in hard work to feel good about yourself without expecting someone else to do it. Lots of these things reduce inflammation which can cause a plethoral of hormone, physical, mental issues. Start cutting out inflammatory things. All alcohol, cigs, sugars, gluten, preservatives. Also recommend finding a hobby that doesn't revolve around appearance. Like gardening, bicycling, knitting, skating, cross stitch, guitar, drawing, coloring, macrame, soap making, tennis, etc.",

            "Oh man if she thinks she looks old at 40 wait until she\u2019s 47. It\u2019s not getting any easier to process. The pressure to look young is INTENSE. I really want to accept what I see in the mirror but it\u2019s HARD!",
            "Also, when you\u2019re watching a TV or a movie with someone older, you could remind her how much make up and cosmetic surgery and stuff these celebrities have had.. not that that\u2019s a bad thing, but it\u2019s not a equal comparison so if she\u2019s looking at them and comparing herself to them an Offhand remark might help . it doesn\u2019t just affect young girls.

            "If you can afford it, I think a nice spa day would do wonders. A facial, massage and mani/pedi can be life-changing and the release of tension can make people feel and look younger. A facial will plump and hydrate her skin and smooth out wrinkles or puffiness and make her glow. :)",

But you can help reframe reality, so that it is easier for the person to see past the thing that was blocking them. \nI\u2019d suggest reading up on body neutrality and implementing it into your worldview. Then your behaviors will show her that you value people for more than their attractiveness (which I know you do already. You are being really thoughtful. And also reassuring someone of their attractiveness emphasizes the importance of having attractiveness). This will help her feel more secure and comfortable as her body changes, as all of ours do. Thinking of bodies in more neutral terms will also likely rub off on her, as well.",

Investing money in skin care treatments as you get older (facials, skin products, and general aesthetician work) goes a long way. Skin to me is the key to feeling good! Also getting massages, having clothes that fit well, good makeup/hair styles for aging skin/hair, having nails done, eating healthy foods that make you feel good, and having opportunities to \u201cdress up\u201d (like for a date night or wedding!) make a big difference in how you might feel at a given time. Of course she might hate some of these things and love others! I can\u2019t stand having acrylic nails but after a facial I feel like a million bucks for 2 weeks. \n\nOf course she doesn\u2019t need skin care or clothes to look better, but confidence is a skin that we put on. Sometimes we need to hack it a little bit. Don\u2019t invest money in her self care to \u201cfix\u201d her, but to celebrate her! Make sure she understands that. \n\nI\u2019d likely approach it as finding her a service she can have done for her birthday/christmas/anniversary/some other special date to her. Compliment her after the service, ask her how she feels, and ask if there\u2019s anything else she\u2019s ever wanted to try\u2014not because it\u2019s something she needs, but because it\u2019s something she DESERVES:) \n\nI know you\u2019re going to get so much good advice on this thread\u2014I\u2019m just offering this as one avenue to build her up and help her see the value she has to you.",

Do you discreetly check out other woman, especially younger ones enjoying showing off their youthful bodies?\n\nIf you do any of these, even if you know in your heart and are plenty satisfied with her and love her body.... nothing you say or do will ever be enough to convince her otherwise, because she isn't enough for your eyes.",
            "My 5 cents worth....Well definitely it'an attitude and I'd say you don't want to grow old gracefully.....especially in your 40s. I get it . U Hit 40 and there are many changes going on including hormonal ....not just how you look. You got to take care of yourself....booze less and sleep.",
            "Botox and filler. If I could post pics. I had rapid and dramatic weight loss. I looked like skin and bones. The filler helped giving some structure and botox for the lines in your forehead, the one between your eyebrows. I love it. I started wearing make up again. I feel confident and I like what I see in the mirror.",

            "I'm much older than her. I've started posting NSFW photos on Reddit, and the comments I've received have made me feel 100% better about myself. I know it's not for everyone,  but it has really helped me.",
            "As i see it there are 2 aspects. I'm 38, people assume i'm in my late 20's. Working out has transformed me. You can both join a gym if you are not working out already. Being more toned and thinner does make you look younger and be stronger and healthier. You can give her or even a couple's spa day / facial treatments etc. the photos you take of her is an amazing gesture, that i love.",
            "Does she have time for self care? What you\u2019re doing is great, keep complimenting her. If she needs time out to do some self care to make her feel better then that could be a place to start. \n\nSometimes, no matter how much we are complimented, we just don\u2019t feel great. It sounds like she needs something to boost her up. Could be getting back into fitness, a new skin care routine, getting nails done, new hair style. There\u2019s so many things that she could to perk her up and bring some confidence back :)",

            "The other thing\u2014yes, older women can absolutely still be beautiful and glamorous and sexy. But, what often makes older women attractive and sexy and powerful is not specifically how they look. When you focus too much on your appearance as the center of what makes you compelling to other people, you miss out on a lot of the gift of aging\u2014which is to learn to be confident and joyful in your own skin.",
            "I need to know those street fashion Tokyo YouTube channels, please!",
            "So wise! Thank you. She does have an excellent older friend like that.",
            "I also agree that having older friends that you admire and respect  helps. Turn 30 really was upsetting to me. I thought all my fun was over, and then I met older women doing all the things I wanted to do (dating, dancing, switching careers, finding themselves, etc.). OP's wife needs hard proof that beauty exists at all ages. Also agree about the internalized ageism but she has to want to change this.",
            "Whoa",
            "I like that last idea! I try to do that. I\u2019ve done that in front of my friend, even, which makes her blush but I think she likes it. \n\nIs it too much to give those compliments in the bedroom? I don\u2019t want her to think that\u2019s all I care about during sex.",
            "I\u2019ll look it up. Thank you!",
            "Thanks for the thoughtful reply, and I agree, accepting ourselves and aging gracefully is a key part of life. We are all getting older! I think she feels her sexual vibrancy is slipping away but I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. Maybe it\u2019s a phase related to turning 40, this is just really out of character.",
            "Many of the women that I know who fall into this are usually women who have treated others a certain way based on their looks. Their entire way of interacting with others is based on a looks scale.",

            "Thanks for this. Sometimes I feel like she doesn\u2019t believe me when I give compliments, even in bed. Tough!",
            "These are great! I am learning today especially how important it is to give compliments in front of others. Seems that\u2019s a thing!\n\nSpecific stuff at intimate times seems to matter as well. \n\nThe museum idea is great!",
            "Im his wife\u2019s age and my partner does this (always has, so it doesn\u2019t feel gratuitous) and while I\u2019m also going through the same crisis, this is a nice thing to do",
            "So well said!",
            "That's too sweet. \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Totally. Nails done, lashes, microblading, blowout, lip blushing, new makeup or skin care, these might not totally change the way you look but can make you feel good.\u00a0\n\nAlso taking yoga can be good for body positivity. Even though sometimes it\u2019s annoying because it\u2019s a lululemon fashion show. But if she finds a good studio with good people it can be great.\u00a0",
            "I love this idea, especially the wardrobe. We did a couples massage, it was surprisingly fun! She has been playing more tennis, too, that has done wonders for her fitness.",

            "Words to live by! Thanks for this. She\u2019s been playing a lot of tennis.",

            "Interesting. I could see how that might do something for your confidence! Good for you.",
            "Thanks! She has been playing more tennis which helps. And I know you\u2019re right, self care matters - probably not enough of that!",
            "I try those too! Great idea.",
            "I am still young but nevertheless I do struggle with self confidence and many times believe that my husband compliments me out of obligation. I communicated that to him, I said that I know that there are so so so many girls that are prettier than me, and girls who have no problem doing all types of invasive and non invasive procedures to look prettier, what makes you want to look at my photos? He explained to me the feelings he gets when he looks at me or my photos. So I think you should do that, explain how looking at her makes you feel rather than just calling her pretty, how it makes you feel deep happiness, warmth, how she got a killer smile, how you love everything about her, and expand on intimate details. Also I love random photos, it\u2019s a great idea. Try to make her catch you admiring her photos, I bet that\u2019ll boost her confidence.",
            "Not just that - it\u2019s a confident boost plus photos for posterity! Something to look back on years, decades later. \n\nHaha it cant be stalkerish!!! Youre her hubby! :) \n\nWhat else can she do for a boost? Best bang for buck? \n\n1. Skin rejuvenation - overall look will improve significantly. Get her into Korean skin care! Take her to South Korea for cheap but effective skin treatments. I dont advocate plastic surgery at all, but low-key \u2018enhancements\u2019 like laser skin treatments like picosure laser, can make a huge difference. \n\n2. No mention of her weight but if she\u2019s not fit and toned, getting fit and toned or even just losing a few kilos can shave some years off - works for everyone! \n\n3. Change of hairstyle, new color cut and style? Is she greying yet? Keeping up with maintenance keeps the years at bay, even if its just superficial. \n\n4. Refresh wardrobe",
            "I would love if my husband did something like this",
            "Thank you! I've thought about this a lot, as you might suspect, lol.",
            "I'm so glad to hear that. Aging is a privilege denied to many, and besides that it's quite a lot of fun!",
            "That's true for older men too! It's just less noticeable because we don't objectify men as a default so we don't demand perfection as a default. We pick them apart less and see them more as a whole when they are young and when they are old, so there isn't a huge shift at a certain age. We always see them as more than just how they look.\n\nMany middle aged male sex symbols have major aesthetic \"flaws\" if we judged them the way we judge women. Pedro Pascal is a good example. Women love him despite the (many) lines on his face, under eye bags, dad/average body, asymmetrical features, prominent nose, etc. They like his vibe, his fashion sense, his cute smile, the way he speaks, how he seems as a person. \n\nEdited: I'm agreeing with you, by the way!",
            "Curiosity Street Style is a good one! If you search \"street stye 50 plus\" you can find more!",
            "Maybe you can encourage her to talk to her friend about these insecurities!",
            "This may sound insane but getting into the Real Housewives of New York helped in this regard! Despite how problematic they can be, it was refreshing as a younger woman to see women in their 40s, 50s and 60s living big lives, going out, having fun, dating etc. Despite the 'Housewives' name, they weren't defined only by status as wife, mother etc. We don't get to see that enough in media.",
            "Yeah, that will 100% make a woman blush because your saying it to others and makes it seem more genuine.\nDuring \u2018sexy time\u2019 LOLL compliment her a little yes. Dont overdo it though or she will think your just saying it. Be specific with your compliments also.\nFor example \u2018your hair looks good today\u2019 \u2018oh your eyes look so bright today\u2019. If you just say \u2018oh you look pretty\u2019 for me anyways, it seems more like a \u2018lazy compliment\u2019 if that makes sense?",

            "That\u2019s great she\u2019s playing tennis and you two enjoyed a couples massage together! If wardrobe is where she could benefit, you\u2019ll need to consider how to approach it. Could be as simple as \u201cgifting\u201d a shopping day with her girl friend at the mall.",

And your husband is right - there are all kinds of \u201chot\u201d women in different stages of undress all over the internet, accessible immediately. But what we care about is seeing YOU. You are the one that is special. Your photos are the ones we want to see when we\u2019re out of town on work trips! It\u2019s all very true. I\u2019d rather see a photo of my wife being silly in the shower than a supermodel posing nude with all kinds of enhancements and airbrushes. And I think most men are like me, I hope at least!",
            "Ha, the only time it felt stalkerish was when we were chatting in the shower and I ran to get my camera! But she actually appreciated that, the lighting was fantastic. \n\nI like 2 and 4 above! Her weight is great and proportions are solid but we can all be a bit more toned I guess. She still wears a bikini but only sees her negatives.",
            "I read your comment as agreeing with me. :) I think you\u2019re right except that men don\u2019t get the cultural messaging that they turn \u201cinvisible\u201d after 40. I am 45 and not especially conventionally attractive but I am probably less invisible now than I have ever been in my life and I think it\u2019s more vibes than anything else.",
            "Thank you so much!",
            "Great idea!",
            "Totally makes sense! It\u2019s like when a friend plays a song or whatever, it\u2019s so much better to say \u201cI liked the part where you changed the chords in the middle\u201d than just \u201cyou sounded great.\u201d\n\nDuring sex it\u2019s obviously more direct in that sense, and kind of dirty by necessity but I think it\u2019s fun to find that balance, if this makes any sense.",
            "I have a question about that if you\u2019re ok messaging me?",
            "I like that idea. And yes, tennis has been great bc it\u2019s a social sport, and she gets noticed sometimes in cute outfits (I bought her 3 tennis skirts for Mother\u2019s Day). I think putting her in a position to get noticed or compliments from someone other than me helps her esteem a lot.",
            "It\u2019s funny you say that - I bought her 3! Cute flirty ones. And of course she had to try them on a few times!",
            "That\u2019s why I like taking photos of her - they are real.",
            "Foreplay is all good!",
            "Just want to say this made me smile in public imagining how killer she must have felt having her husband jump out of the shower bc she looked so sexy he needed to document it. Good for both of you!!!!",
            "Take her shopping if she likes to shop! Buy her stuff she feels confident in",
            "That's so true. They also don't get constantly fear mongered that their wives will \"trade them in for a younger model\". I think it's all a bunch of bullshit to keep women afraid and compliant and buying useless stuff. \n\nI have also yet to experience the supposed invisibility cloak of cronehood. I've seen no difference in that arena from 30 to 40.",
            "Yeah! Its the specifics. Makes it sound more genuine!\nAlso during sexy time yea, it will be more different compliments! As long as your not saying \u2018your so sexy\u2019 every 5 seconds lol.\nJust a simple \u2018wow your so good\u2019 even complimenting her techniques etc.",
            "Yes go ahead!",
            "Ah I see. In beauty there\u2019s the rule that you should walk out the door with 2/3 aspects \u201cpresentable\u201d: hair, makeup, outfit.\n\nHydrofacial and dermaplaning at a spa makes skin absolutely glow (I dermaplane and use RLT mask at home). A deep conditioning treatment and blowout at a hair salon gives model-tier hair. I mention these because doing those 2 things alone will turn heads.",
            "My husband will sometimes try (playfully) to delay me from leaving when I have cute skirts on and smack my butt. You\u2019re doing all the right things!",
            "Yeah this is like the most wholesome thing I've ever seen on Reddit haha. Great husband!!!",
            "Glad it made you smile! It was just something about the water and lighting. She actually loved it, wasn\u2019t shy about it. I was cold but it was worth it, lol.",
            "I like that. I\u2019ve tried that with swimwear!",
            "Yeah hope this isn\u2019t tmi, but when she\u2019s on top is when it\u2019s most obviously the time for that - she\u2019s obviously fully on display, and more in control of the movements. I try to find the right words in that moment!",
            "And yes, generic compliments in bed sound kind of silly almost - like \u201cyou\u2019re so sexy\u201d or \u201cthis feels great\u201d? Boring lol",
            "Thanks! For some reason I couldn\u2019t initiate a chat, could you try from your end?",
            "That\u2019s a great idea. I think that would be great for her too. Do you think the head turning aspect is healthy?",
            "I assume that\u2019s a good thing? lol",
            "I thought it might come off as creepy! So thanks! lol",
            "Especially if you have an event coming up. Can be casual or fancy. But somewhere she can feel awesome in new clothes surrounded by friends and family. Like if there\u2019s a wedding or family or work event that you\u2019ll go together. Then she can help you pick out a complimenting tie or something. Also new shoes are great for feeling good too",
            "Whoops yes can do",
            "I think the initial boost is all she needs to take pride in her appearance again. From there she can grow into a more elaborate skin/self care routine. Eventually she won\u2019t rely on the validation because she herself knows she is beautiful inside and out. \n\nIf you go to my recent [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vindicta/s/AkV3cmk0DU) history I give pics and details of a \u201cglow up\u201d in my early 30s where I was feeling like your wife. Sometimes *knowing* what to do is the initial hurdle so hopefully those details can be of help to your wife and others.",

            "Wow - appreciate that. I love the glow up idea - thanks for sharing those details! Did it do things for your confidence?",
            "lol, honestly the validation about shower photos is helping me!",
            "Definitely boosted my confidence, although being a shy introvert the attention can be a bit much. Most importantly though it made me confident interacting with new people, colleagues, dating, etc. I didn\u2019t get swept up into \u2018beauty is my main identity\u2019 though otherwise the need to validation would never be satiated. Helps that I live in an intellectual city so beauty and brains goes much further than just one or the other.\n\nWishing you and your wife the best in your journey!",

        "content": "For years I had been using Revitalash and had the most long, gorgeous eyelashes that I received regular compliments about. I thought I was using an expensive, \u201chealthier\u201d brand and that the thinner skin / purplish pink colour on my under eyes was more to do with aging (I am 29) and genetics (as I\u2019ve also had deep hollows but never this bad). Over the last couple years I noticed my under eyes becoming a lot worse and I become very self conscious about my undereyes so I started really reading into the possible side effects of eyelash serums (as I knew there were possible negative side effects but again I thought I was using the best / healthier brand) and wondered if I was experiencing orbital fat lash from my eyelash serum. \n\nI stopped about one month ago and WOW my under eye skin has improved sooooo much and is slowly becoming plumper / less pink and purple coloured. I also used to have very hooded eyelids but noticed these disappeared (which I didn\u2019t mind) and again I thought this was just due to aging and losing weight in my face but have also realised it was the eyelash serum as they are slowly starting to coming back. I have regained my confidence and feel like I now look a lot more youthful. \n\nI can\u2019t believe I was basically melting the fat around my eyes and aging myself by using eyelash serum and I wish I realised sooner. I will miss my long lashes but for me personally, it is not worth it. I know not everyone experiences this, but if you suspect you are I would recommend taking a break and seeing if you notice a difference.  \n\nHere is a post from TikTok that is very similar to my story https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSY5Cmss2/",

            "I've used Lash24 by Hair La Vie, and Keranique eyelash serum. With both of them I've gotten similar results. I get a bit of length, but more than anything I get a bunch of something like tiny baby lashes. I know it sounds weird lol. I'm guessing they don't fall out as much, and the ones that do grow can't get stimulated enough to reach a full size. And it took about a good four months to truly see results. I'm over 50 so if you're younger your results may be better than mine.",
            "You must be one of the lucky ones yay. Lots of people don\u2019t see any negative side effects with lash serum.",
            "Yeah me too! Have been using Revitalash for like 4-5 years now and I never experienced any side effects. I was confused for a while cause there are so many horror stories here",
            "I\u2019m not sure if I could trust any others either :(",
            "I\u2019ve also used these serums and noticed my Nasolabial folds getting deeper and figured it was from aging. Nope, fat loss from the eyelash serum and skin sagging. I stopped about six months ago and there has been some improvement. I\u2019m not back to where I was before but hopefully it continues to improve.",
            "I'm also thinking would this give me long eyelashes and less hooded eyes!",
            "I was replying to the comment about where I apply the serum which is upper lash.",
            "I answered the question the person asked based on my own experience.",
            "Sorry I thought it was a reply to my response, I see now and I agree.",
            "No problem. I already had hollow eyes naturally and I really regret using lash serums :(",
            "Me too!! :( I do wonder what my under eyes would look like now if I had never used lash serum. Have you seen improvement since stopping?",
            "I think some improvement, but they\u2019re definitely still very hollow. Definitely part of it is just being in my 30\u2019s now, but it did seem to get worse really rapidly while using lash serums so I\u2019m certain they accelerated it. And yet I miss the crazy long horse lashes still haha"
