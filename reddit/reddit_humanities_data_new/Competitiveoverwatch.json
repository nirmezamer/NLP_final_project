            "I don't know if any Blizz employees regularly read this or not but, if so, can you please give me some hope that you are reworking the tank role? I have played tank since early Overwatch 1 and I don't think I've ever hated the experience this much before. It is honestly heartbreaking. It feels like most games I'm performing as best as I can and it's just never enough. It feels like I have no impact at all in the game and that I might as well not play. Can you give any kind of hope for a reworked tank role?",
            "It never did, but I've seen quite some ppl that think it does",
            "Makes you invulnerable during the pull so if you're pulsed, the pulse can explode while pulling and will do nothing.",
            "I don't know what you mean by reworking, but there's not anything along those lines in the recent Blizzard AMA. However, there will be a new patch tomorrow and QP Hacked is testing out pickable passives soon",

        "content": "Flats definitely pulls the biggest numbers on Twitch, having significantly more viewers than a lot of other creators (as I'm writing this, the only people who come close to his amount of viewership are aspen and super). and I think that to the more casual/young player base, he's treated as a massive voice of authority, and people get the impression that he's some awakened ow player that knows everything.\n\nNow onto my issue: He's probably the biggest doom and gloom person I'm ever seen surrounding the game of overwatch, and I'm slightly worried that because of his massive audience blizz will make bad changes because the flats community wants it, not because the overwatch community needs it.\n\nI get it, because he's a tank player he's kinda suffered a lot the past couple years, but i swear he just can't be positive about anything. I wonder if he feels like he needs to keep up his negative personality because it increases numbers or something else. I don't play tank, so maybe i just don't get how terrible it feels to play tank for the entire lifetime of overwatch, but it seems excessive.\n\nThe biggest example I have was [his reaction video to the S11 balance changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBB1BDioZZg). In my opinion, and going off of other posts that I've seen here, the patch was a massive W. Well-designed heroes like Dva and JQ are buffed, Hog is nerfed and Orisa is still probably going to be bad after the 1 second spin change. Cass/Soj changes are amazing and make them way healthier. The reaper changes make him a better flanker but don't change his tank matchups. Kiri changes were also good.\n\nNow if you watch the full reaction, there's so much negative, possibly rage-baity things he says to get people to complain about the game in the comments, which frankly pissed me off a little bit. For example, when he read the notes for the new flashbang, he sounded like he hated it, even though it's a million times better than the steaming pile of garbage that was mag grenade. Putting \"TANKBUSTERS BUFFED\" in the title of the video and complaining about that when the patch makes reaper less tank-buster and stuff like that. He made the Orisa change sound so much worse than it actually is.\n\nThe moment that made me write out this post was when he talked about the Sojourn changes. Anyone who actually read the notes can immediately tell that this is a massive nerf. The main reason she was running competitive play was because her rail was OP, and the compensating buffs don't come close to covering the huge rail nerf. But what did flats say? \"So nerf, buff, buff, buff. 1 nerf and 3 buffs. \\*sighs and facepalms like crazy\\* you're killing me here. this looks like a low Elo buff.\"\n\nI have read so many comments that just follow the logic of \"3 is more than 1 blizzard why the hell are you buffing Sojourn\" and I'm kinda tired of it, so I'm making this post to talk about it.\n\nWhat do y'all think, do you think I could be exaggerating a little bit, these are just my thoughts.",

            "The reason his audience is so big is because he spams shitty tiktoks and ig reels and it pulls in the untapped market of the massive ow casual audience. Also because they\u2019re casual, they can\u2019t tell he\u2019s shit at the game and has zero clue what he\u2019s talking about. (Im his number 1 hater btw)",
            "From his videos starting a few  month ago, it's seems to me he is burnt out of OW.  He doesn't enjoy playing anymore and that's a sad place to be.",
            "Flats is in the phase of not wanting to play OW anymore, but has too because it\u2019s his job. I kind of get it because that would be a sad place to be for some. It\u2019s a pretty bad burn out, so I feel like he will be like that unless something big happens in the game. I stopped watching him because his content was just constant negativity. Nothing against people criticizing OW or anything like that, but it felt like it was all he was doing for a good bit and I just got bored. Tbh I\u2019d rather watch super. Dude is still good at the game and complains about it sometimes, but he doesn\u2019t spend 2 hours complaining doing react Andy. He just says \u201cthis game is fucking trash lmao\u201d and queues ranked and moves on. \n\nNot sure if Blizz would only pay attention to him or something like that since he is not the only big creator.",
            "Yeah, I completely stopped watching this guy after seeing his reaction to the patch notes. It's just a completely ridiculous reaction to a really good patch. At this point, he has to be feeding into the hate, seeing how many more views and how much more income he likely generates from it.",
            "It isn't because he's a tank player, it's because he really doesn't want to play Overwatch anymore but feels like he has to because he's scared his viewership will disappear if he leaves the game.",
            "Don't excuse his awful attitude because he's a tank player. Emongg is also a tank player and is a complete joy to watch plus he plays Overwatch 20x more than flats does (he just reacts to random stuff/plays other games while somehow still crying about OW)",
            "He\u2019s OWs Asmongold",
            "His takes are generally pretty bad and his stance on things flip flop based on who he\u2019s talking to.",
            "I can't even stand him when I watch other people's stream with him in it. Anyone watched somnus's stream yesterday? He was arguing about english dialect or something. I couldn't even stay around. Just did my chores around my apartment.",
            "I swear there's this guy called GSraider who as always is a 6v6er and complains about tank and how entire ow streamer community are blizzard shills, got to the comment section and read to most braindead takes of all time, then it finally started to make sense on which type of community these guys attract.  \nThe takes in question :\n\n1. Bastion/torb are 2 of the most powerful dps in the game\n2. You cannot counter zen's discord orb\n\nI don't even know what to say",
            "I used to be a massive Flats stan. I enjoyed his videos of duoing with Emongg in the end of Overwatch 1. Shit was just the right amount of funny, educational (as I was a Rein main as well) and in a format that suited my life at that time. \n\n\nHis opionins wasn't always right but everyone knows the game was far from being in its best state back then. So I could listen to him complaining and even agree with some points.\n\n\nThen OW2 came out. And his fun gameplay videos are almost non existent. I mean they exist but I don't get the fun vibe out of them anymore. I don't know if I changed or if the lack of tank duo shenanigans made them less entertaining. Say what you want about 6v6  but watching two people cooperate to make Rein Zaria work in a double shield meta was extremely satisfying. Hell I would even take watching double shield from them instead of watching either of them do solo tanking. This is just boring. So there is that.\n\n\nNow when it comes to complaining. I just can't stand the guy anymore. I agree with him that the mad cycle of shit tanks being meta needs to end. But given such a great patch as s11, when I saw his thumbnail TANK BUSTERS BUFFED. I almost clicked unsubscribe. On the SvB podcast he mostly just rants about various shit without offering any viable solution except for sending the hero to a farm as he says it. Which should not be the solution ever, unless the hero hard takes over the game as we had with Mauga on release. I hate playing against Hog, I came back to competitive for the end of the season and I fucking fumed each time I saw this hero in the opposite team. But I just don't get his points. Many times people mention that Hog is terrible because with giving him vape on resource they took away the counterplay. Which was the point \u261d\ufe0f. Hog was hard countered by every stun in the game which meant he was one of the most counterable heroes in the game. Yes the rework introduced a lot of new problems but also solved some. So yeah I stopped paying attention to his opionins about balance.\n\n\nAnd don't get me started on his ego. SvB should do a fact check ever time the guy says I told you so. Everyone is right once in a while but for real there is no need to rub into everybody faces. But he sometimes says he said something where he did the exact opposite thing. Or much more common, where he said something was going to happen, but in completely different circumstances. Yes sometimes the context is important. I won't get into him arguing and banning people in his chat because I don't watch his streams, but I heard that it's also an issue.\n\n\nSo yeah that my pov on the guy. I agree with you but everyone is entitled to his opinion and so is Flats. He can post his balance takes online, so can we. I still have some respect for the guy as I said in the last days of OW1 he was a huge light in the end of the tunnel. Remember Flats Lamp? That was a top tier meme. And even after all this shit I told about him I still watch some of his content. Yes it's about him reacting to a TikTok guy who rngs sandwiches for a living but it's enjoyable enough.",
            "flats twitch views are extremely inflated due to drops. if you look at his [twitch tracker](https://twitchtracker.com/flats/statistics) you can see how much the viewers inflate when he has drops vs when he doesn't have drops. super is still the biggest overwatch streamer without drop inflation. you can see how much more consistent his viewers are in his [twitch tracker](https://twitchtracker.com/supertf/statistics). remember, cah had like 50k viewers when drops were on but once most people got them it dropped to like 10-20k. flats just is the bigger presence on all social platforms though.\n\nblizz has a whole creator discord that they get feedback through. flats is just one of those creators. i don't think many see flats as a leader, they just see him with an opinion and they value it higher than other creators for some reason",
            "Ya I stopped giving Flats any credit for his actual understanding of the game a while ago. He can be a fairly entertaining guy to watch but everything he says should be taken with a huge amount of salt.\u00a0\n\nThere are other much more reliable and rational sources to get an understanding of the state of the game.\u00a0",
            "My voice of OW is still Super.",
            "There's was time I had solid respect him as a CC but I feel like he already got pretty negative back in late OW1 and has been on a steady down track ever since. Heavy frustration is reasonable and definitely in touch with plenty of his audience (I'm in that camp myself), but I can't remember the last time I've seen anything remotely constructive out of him, it's all just ragey rage with no substance.",
            "Definitely not the most doom and gloom person lmao that easily goes to Samito",
            "Why would a streamer who gets a couple thousand viewers affect a game that nets 30k players on Steam alone? That\u2019s like Team 4 designing their game around making r/cow happy",
            "Honestly I don\u2019t get how people put these guys on a pedestal lmfao",
            "I remember when Flats made cool rein tutorials with no face cam",
            "I stopped watching after his brig ult change rant. \u201cIt\u2019s ow1 again\u201d because she gets 2 stuns max during an ult. \u201cNo that wasn\u2019t my point, look at these OWL pick rate stats, see she\u2019s broken\u201d while conveniently ignoring the Winston tracer sombra ana pick rates right next to her. \u201cIk what I\u2019ll do, I\u2019ll post clips of me primal raging an ulting(sometimes  nano)brig, and show that I can\u2019t kill her as Winston in this specific situation, that will prove my point..\u201dHis arguments weren\u2019t even close to being rational and then when  he got called out on it, it\u2019s \u201cthe support mains can\u2019t handle it or the low ranks don\u2019t see how broken she is because they can\u2019t play her..\u201d Maybe that brig change was slightly overturned in metas that favor her, but not to the extent flats was taking it.",
            "I understand the frustration with clickbait and ragebait, but let's remember that this isn't unique to Flats. When the PVE news dropped, many creators jumped on the \"PVE is cancelled\" bandwagon, even though it wasn't entirely accurate. The community seemed to accept that kind of sensationalism then, which, in my opinion, set a precedent that this behavior is just part of the business. It's important to be consistent in calling out misleading content, not just when it suits us.\n\nRegarding Flats being seen as the \"voice\" of the Overwatch community, I don't think it's accurate to place that label on any single person. There are numerous voices in the community, and the Overwatch team considers feedback from a variety of sources. Yes, Flats made some questionable comments, like the \"3 buffs, 1 nerf\" remark, but ultimately, it's up to the viewers to think critically about the content they consume. If people blindly follow without understanding the nuances, they'll eventually realise the oversimplification when they try to echo those opinions.",
            "Any one main voice isnt great for a community, whether flats or someone else imo. It's funny how people with actually rational takes are driven away, eg Stylosa, with a 'doomer' label (talking in general, not just comp topics).\n\nThe entire OW mainstream creator community is clearly reducing into a top 10 NA based echo chamber of creators that Blixzard wants to work with. Sign of the layoffs/times I guess. \n\nVery clear from who released preview content for season 11 that blizzard have axed a bunch of creators from having access.",
            "I remember watching a flats video a little while ago where he was reacting to an old video giving tips for release brig, and the video he was reacting to mentioned how brig could duel a rein and win, and my man completely unironically said \"she still can\". And then never addressed that again.",
            "I am way way way more concerned with this subreddit, and the main subreddit than I am concerned for some random streamer who is legitimately one of the best players in the game consistently.\n\nAtleast that guy has credentials, and a following. This sub and the main sub are just hoards of plat players morphing their warped opinions into a group think, and then forcing their demands onto Blizzard.\n\nWorry about yourself hombre.",
            "i\u2019ve never seen a community with a more parasocial relationship with a shitty streamer than this sub. every fourteen seconds we\u2019ll have some redditor sucking his own dick about le evil fat streamer waiting for other redditors to come here pat his back and start sucking their own dicks in return. straight don quixote shit fighting made up arguments against him \n\nthat\u2019s the worst part, it\u2019s made up. half the time he\u2019ll talk about how some patch notes r dogshit and how he likes the other half lol \n\n\n\u201che said he didn\u2019t like cass flashbang despite it being such a hecking wholesome good changerino :(((( why he disagree :((((\u201c LOL",
            "Can't call myself a Flats fan, can't call myself a Flats hater, but certainly can relate to most of his takes. The fact that you don't play tank is probably one of the reasons you don't understand him.",
            "Fuck Sombra if I'm playing tank. She makes over half the tanks useless. Very little counter play other than \"just don't get hacked\"",
            "Ppl dont like Flats?? Can someone explain what Im missing?",
            "Hell yeah \ud83d\udc4d",
            ">Flats definitely pulls the biggest numbers on Twitch, having significantly more viewers than a lot of other creators (as I'm writing this, the only people who come close to his amount of viewership are aspen and super). and I think that to the more casual/young player base, he's treated as a massive voice of authority, and people get the impression that he's some awakened ow player that knows everything.\n\n  \nI know what you mean. Since i've been playing this game for almost a decade now, i can see through his bullshit lmao. They already do a lot of bad changes because of Flats and other streamers. Primary reason is i think devs are genuinely ignorant and incompetent. They are really bad.",
            "I don\u2019t know what flat said because I haven\u2019t watch the video, but this game has become a spammy mess. You don\u2019t need to aim anymore, the hit boxes are so big you could shoot air and get a headshot. It\u2019s complete garbage. I want my $40 game back, the one that they deleted.",
            "He is also *far* from being the biggest OW creator on Twitch. Without Twitch drops he hovers between the 1-2k mark. Without drops Super gets 5-6k easy, Aspen gets 3k+, Taiyo gets 2-3K, Emongg and ML7 both get 2k+, Jay3 around 2k. \n\nSeagull gets more viewers playing fucking League of Legends than Flats gets playing OW without drops. \n\nFlats just has good strategies figured out regarding how to get the maximum amount of Casual OW players to idle on his stream when drops go live, Vs other streams. Emongg helps him out as they cycle their viewers, sometimes for days on end, by hosting each other. Most of those people are never actually watching Flats streams.\n\nDrops viewer manipulation by the biggest streamers in a specific directory is something many streamers have complained about for years but Twitch has never really done anything about it. Their discovery is fucking garbage which allows the top few already established streamers to get all causal players of any game to idle on their streams instead of checking out a smaller streamers. \n\n\nThe only reason he gets so much engagement on YT, Tiktok, Twitter, is because he does all the cheap engagement bait tricks like Doombaiting and general Clickbait. That's what he's good at. Engagement manipulation and farming. Not at being an actually entertaining Twitch streamer. \n\n\n\nAnd he (along with many other OW content creators who have been perpetually stagnant in viewership for years and have also failed to switch to other games or variety) does all this engagement bait because he can't hold and grow his viewership organically anymore.\n\n\nI've said it before, you'll see other CCs complain about the game on their stream constantly but they don't complain just to farm engagement.\n\n\nLike Super and Aspen, the two biggest OW CCs right now, you'll see them regularly complain about the game on stream but their complaints are genuine and not simply for YT, Tiktok, Twitter engagement bait. \n\n\nTheir complaints always sound legit, coherent, and follow the same internal logic Vs people like Flats, Samito, are in the *business of doombaiting*. \n\n\nThey've made it their jobs to constantly doombait and complain about the game cause they can't hold and grow their viewership organically. They are always looking for something new to complain about and you'll often see them flip-flopping and randomly coming up with new things to complain about or they'll complain about things that they know can never be changed. This way they *always* have something to complain about no matter what. \n\n\n\nMeanwhile someone like Super is always funny even when complaining about the game, even when he's not having a good time, and if he's genuinely not having a good time he just switches to another game, and he still gaps these Doombaiters like Flats, Samito, etc in viewership *multiple times over* while playing other games. That's cause he's actually entertaining and funny. \n\n\n\nA Twitch stream is supposed to be an entertainment show, like watching an unscripted comedy show or like how people used to watch their siblings play video games as kids, but these cheap streamers have turned theirs into those cheap CNN or Fox News like shows with the constant engagement/anger bait and constant doom and gloom.\n\n\nThey've made it their job to get people regularly angry just like those CNN and Fox news personalities do to get people hooked to their shows and watch them like mindless bots for years or end.",
            "I remember me and my friend watching his highlight and watching him walk straight line into a bap matrix on Rein",
            "Yeah but who isn't shit and has a clue about this game other than actual pros?\n\nNo one. Including some of the devs too no doubt.",
            "yeah i kinda get it esp with him losing his emongg duo. he's basically stopped playing comp and only qps but his viewerbase is attached to the game. i think he could do really well with a game swap, probably to marvel rivals.",
            "Starting a few months ago? He's been burnt out and threatening to quit since the tail end of season 1",
            "The last time I saw him play comp earlier this week, he was grouped with Emongg and Ruben, and they lost a push map. He then immediately is saying enemy Cassidy is probably cheating then spends over 10 minutes going thru the vod and convincing his chat that random dude who popped off is cheating. Just Doom and gloom from him.",
            "Yeah.  \nI like Flats and I think his streams and videos are a joy to watch if he is having fun. Sadly this rarely seems to be the case any more, it seems to be mostly \"playing QP and complaining\" these days.\n\nI get it, every game gets stale if you play it too much, which is probably even more the case if you're a a tank player in OW.\n\nBut yeah, I hope he finds something that he enjoys doing again. Maybe streaming more variety content, maybe taking a break, maybe even switching games completely... Idk. Whatever it is, it would probably be more fun for him and more fun for his viewers as well.",
            "I stopped watching him years ago when his streams blew up and turned from fun rein gameplay to either flexing his massive ego or whining about every role besides tank being OP and able to carry games",
            "Oh just I loved playing with him, getting flamed for like 1 or two mistakes, then going back to watch his VOD and completely fucking int the whole match.\n\nSo many trash can streamers do this. It\u2019s such a headache playing with them. At least if pros flame I can watch their VOD and they are popping off. \n\nBut I don\u2019t want to hear anything from Samito or Flats or anyone",
            "I thought he was meh until I watched him shit talk a bronze player... Dude I don't care how much the bronze thought they deserved plat, you help them.",
            "no you are wrong, from the perspective of a tank player the patch is just ok, they finally got around to nerfing some of the really op heroes, a single questionable buff but i can work around that it doesnt matter, the issue is tank sucks complete fucking ass and none of these balance changes are doing anything even remotely close to fixing its issues, unless u play rein then ur ult will land a bit more, but he is still boring to play the rest of the time cause u just need to shield bot",
            "To be fair the patch is shit like really bad, 2 months for 6 heroes that don't change anything really same boring meta. If I worked this slow I would get fired simple.",
            "this becomes even more apparent when u see his utube video titles with something like \"OW player goes bowling\" lol",
            "Tbf it feels like being a tank player left its impact on Emongg too. I don't watch him too often but when I do it seems like he's just better at holding back all the negativity when Flats expresses it fully.",
            "So true. I blocked his clips channel on YT recently as most of the posts are just rage bait now. It's depressing",
            "you mean OW Asmongold editor?",
            "bro that guy is actually insufferable, i genuinly wonder if he's actually an adult with how childish he acts",

            "They axed the access because someone leaked a lot of shit once. They had a huge NDA sever where basically every cc had access to. Someone leaked something too soon and they decided to change their policy. Which feels shitty but honestly can't blaim them. Also lower headcount probably means they have less people to control those content creators. So you might have the point here. But the leak was the main reason.",

            "Omg is Flats the OW Tucker Carlson??????",
            "I quit flats years ago when several of his videos stabbed at ranks below GM for not being good, knowing nothing. The \"doom and gloom\" description is spot on. He attacks casuals, and expects people to respect his opinion. Pulling people in from tiktok/insta with good clips, because he is good, is gonna happen. But his content is gonna keep pushing them away again",

            "He's definitely directly responsible for a lot of the fuel behind the hatred of tank in OW2. I've honestly been having a lot of fun on Tank in OW2 and play as much as I play DPS. I just think some specific characters are annoying, but theyre not too strong this season so it feels really good rn.",
            "There's pain in those eyes.",
            "I absolutely agree, unfortunately. Emongg has become like Flats light right now, there's A LOT more complaining and like bitter \"sarcasm\" these days. I know Tank is in a tougher spot at the moment but overall I don't like the direction he's taking, tbh..",
            "At the time, I felt it was important to make the distinction because there was still a PVE product being developed and set for release. This confusion led to odd conversations in Season 6 while streamers tried the PVE mode like:\n\n> \"I thought PVE was cancelled?\"  \n> \"It was.\"  \n> \"Then what are you playing right now?\"  \n> \"The PVE.\"\n\nBlizzard significantly changed what they planned to release for the PVE mode, but saying \"PVE is cancelled\" was a misleading statement.

Think about how often you see a doom in your lobby who goes in and will just feed non stop. Probably happens sometimes but not much. BECAUSE thats a guaranteed loss or they realise and swap to something else straight away. Think about when you see a doom playing well. Probably high kills low deaths and STILL can very easily lose that game. Now think of almost any other tank (especially ones like mauga hog orisa). How often do you see a player just running it down, feeding on these characters yet they can still stay alive, get heaps of value and still win games. They dont have to worry about being hard countered every game, they can stay the character they want and still have fun. The people who make you dislike doomfist are the players who have mastered the way to play a high skill ceiling character. I can understand what you say about Doomfist being annoying, because he definitely can be when youre getting punched around, but that doesnt make him busted. To actually get that value, you need to be aware of all the enemies cooldowns and try to bait out the important ones before you can even think of doing anything.

I get the point is to talk about the character, but I truly can\u2019t get behind the idea that every main thinks their character is ass at the moment\u2026. especially the characters that have been good/fine for a long while. Sometimes I feel like it\u2019s not my place as some may be more versed in that character, but as an outsider looking in, it\u2019s just funny to see (and a little jarring)",
            "meteor strike being more bloated with abilities than kiriko as a whole and they will still whine about it",
            "The problem with doom is that the devs do not know what they are doing with doom. They keep on giving him buffs where he does not need them, an example being on how much importance they place on getting empowered punch, which is bad for both sides. For the doom you are punchbotting the whole game and one missed punch could cost you the fight, and the enemy team is constantly eating cc cause you can get 2 punches up in like 2 seconds if they shoot your block. The other problem is block. When the your team is giving him empowered punch by shooting his block, you may end up being punished for your teams mistakes and they don\u2019t get punished (directly). For doom, you have to sit with a block hoping that you will be shot and not slept, antied, hooked etc, which makes it one of the worst damage mitigation tools in the game, as it does not block any cc, does not put up a shield to block, and does not give health. Empowered punch is extremely gimmicky and cringe to use and play against cause it basically turns your playstyle into a punch bot dishing out cc all game. They also choose to remove a bunch of techs that he had in beta which make him super clunky and just lower his skill ceiling (why they weren\u2019t op they were fun to use), he has so many glitches and no regs on his kit and all of that to get punished and lose a team fight for one mistake. I love doom but I think they have put wayy too much power in his punch and way too little in his slam which makes him feel brain dead to play, the balance team does not know what they are doing with him, they have partially killed his identity as a hero with the changes they have been making to doom and the direction they are taking him too is not beneficial for either side that plays in a doom lobby.",

            "Winston bubble enables him to bully 90% of the cast.\n\n\nEffective counterplay exists. Its called movement, cover, and use of cc to disrupt his effective range.\n\nIts the same tools you use against Damage chars, just on a tank.",
            "Doomfist literally has winston leap on a 8 second cd, and does short range damage, paired with disruption tools to take and utilise attention.\n\nThey play the same game with a different colour of paint,",
            "Yes, they function similarly.\n\n Doomfist is even worse at actually disrupting backlines most of the time because he has 0 staying power. You shoot him, he is forced to either use a cd or leave.\n\nIm not gonna act like he doesnt kill things, but he is overly reliant on actually getting an elim. If he doesnt get one, his value is nearly always dimished hugely.\n\n\nThe only problem with his kit IMO is how strong empowered punch is.",
            "I'm offended that you are still sticking with this, lol. No one says doom doesn't have counter play, but his counter play doesn't come from the majority of the cast it comes from like 4 or 5 characters. There's a reason why he's by far the least liked character in the game, and he's had to be reworked and changed constantly. If it was as easy as don't get hit, there would never be strong characters in any game. He's not strong he's just not healthy. And stop talking about Winston they are nothing alike, and it makes you look ridiculous.",
            "By your own definition, dva is 90% of the same character as Winston. Close range, Winston leap on shift woth disruption, and she even has a shield. You are describing tanks as a class... do we also put rein in this list?",
            "Dva is still 90% the same as character as winston.\n\n\nThe 10% makes all the difference."
