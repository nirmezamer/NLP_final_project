            "Awesome! Now we can have an honest conversation.\n\nI think both those things, and not for the reasons you might think.\n\nFirst there\u2019s the fact that contests are rigged in general - not just beauty pageants but even ones like the Emmys and Oscars. There have been everything from news articles to documentaries and everything else that go into detail about how it\u2019s done. Do a bit of research and you\u2019ll find mountains of it online. In 2022 even the contestants themselves finally decided to speak out against Miss America and there\u2019s no shortage of information online you can look into to find out what has been going on with that organization. It has been going on for decades, and is nothing new or even related to trans people.\n\nAs for a trans person winning - that\u2019s great and all, but for a trans person to win you have to get a room full of straight men to say that they find a trans woman more attractive than the some of the most attractive women that America has to offer, and also be willing to piss off every born-woman in the show, which is who draws in the money and viewership (and who they all want to sleep with if they haven\u2019t already). Even _if_ straight men really found her(him?) more attractive, I have yet to find a single one who would admit as much on public TV. I have a very hard time believing any of that happened without outside influence.\n\nBut back to the original point - regardless of trans or not trans I wouldn\u2019t take _any_ of these televised award shows/competitions seriously. Ever. They\u2019re all rigged to hell and back.\n\nEdit: For what it\u2019s worth I\u2019m glad that you decided to be upfront after all, and I respect that. It\u2019s honest. I take back what I said about you not having the balls for it.",

            "Yeah some trans women were genetically blessed and you can't tell unless you're being weird (mentally disturbed) and looking at every woman you see for \"signs\". But, the vast majority do have an obvious look to them. And that's ok, is it not?\u00a0",

            "*Trans* is latin for \"on the other side\"\n\n*Cis* is latin for \"on the same side\"\n\nThis is how language works. We use words to describe things. People are so brainrotted on this issue that they're arguing against the concept of adjectives lmao",
            "But sometimes you have a reason to say otherwise.  Like 99% of the time when you're talking about a guitar, it doesn't matter at all that it's a left-handed guitar.  Jimi Hendrix was a great guitar player.  Left-handed guitars ARE guitars.\n\n But in the context where you're asking whether a guitar is playable by a lefty, it's perfectly normal to call it a \"right-handed guitar\".  It's a way that things can be, so we as humans have a term for it.  That's what we do.  99% of the time when you're talking about a woman, the fact that they are trans or not is irrelevant.  But if you're talking about whether someone is trans or not, there is a word for that either way.  They took the Latin root from \"trans-gender\" and reversed it to get \"cis-gender\".  You don't need to use it, it's just a technical term.  Like \"neurotypical\" and \"able-bodied\" and the term \"the seeing\", which is only relevant if you're talking specifically about the comparison with blind people.  These words all exist, and they all mean \"normal\" in different ways.  \n\nSo I ask you again, why does this one in particular bother you?  If someone said something about a \"right handed guitar\" would you reply \"ummm I think you mean a NORMAL guitar\"?  Or if someone in a wheelchair told you that \"able-bodied people will never know how much I hate stairs\", would you reply, \"I've never heard of that term I think you mean NORMAL people\"?  Or is it just \"cisgender\" that bothers you?",
