        "content": "Second time posting this because some nice redditors pointed out you could still see my roommates names and my last name. Thank you to those two. \n\nLike the title says, one of my roommates, let\u2019s call him K, keeps stealing things from us. However we don\u2019t have solid proof so that\u2019s why we don\u2019t go to the police. He has left his door open and we were able to get some things he\u2019s stolen from us, but most of which we have not. They were the cheap things that were less than $10.\n\nThese things have ranged from expensive chef knives, all of my forks I inherited from my dad when he died, so much of MY food (which especially sucks when I\u2019m the second poorest in the house after K), finding my nice towels that are apart of a set that had gone missing in his laundry, shower products, my books he\u2019s taken and wouldn\u2019t return after I told him no, batteries for the remotes in the house, and like 8 of my mugs. Our mug shelf used to be FULL but is now as barren as I hope he will be.\n\nThe way we know it\u2019s him is that all of my other roommates have talked separately and some of their shit has gone missing too and this only started after he moved in. He is the latest addition to the house so I\u2019ve tried talking to him directly. He never answers his door, won\u2019t answer any text messages, and is seemingly impossible to catch in person because he\u2019ll just stay in his room until we have left the house. I won\u2019t just barge into his room; there are still lines I won\u2019t cross as a roommate. I\u2019m also afraid of retaliation. He has anger issues and aggressive tendencies and has guns in his room. We have heard him call me and my other gay roommate homophobic slurs when he gets angry when he thinks we can\u2019t hear him.\n\nI\u2019ve told all of this to our landlord but all he said was we could change our doorknobs to have a lock on them if we wanted to. \n\nI had had enough of his shit and trying to be nice by not pointing him out directly, trying to have one on one conversations to not put him on blast for the whole house while hoping he would own up to anything.\n\nWhile the things he has stolen from me have been small for the most part (the expensive chef knives are not mine), I\u2019ve had to go without food because of this fucker. But I don\u2019t have solid proof to go to the police with it.\n",

Realistically the safest option *is* to just make sure everything steal-able is locked down as much as possible, even though that sucks. He might not be likely to actually hurt anyone but I personally wouldn\u2019t take the chances. Sounds like it\u2019s a real POS you got on your hands here.",

            "There are a few options you have: the first one, you need to talk to your landlord. Someone with anger issues and guns is already not a safe environment so a direct confrontation could possibly be a dangerous idea. It is possible the dude pays month to month and the landlord can decide to not renew his lease if he has sympathy for you and your roommates. Now what I would do:\n\n\nI would 100% buy a camera for the kitchen. Place it high up where you can view the entire fridge. You can buy cameras from Amazon for ~$50 and maybe the roommates can pitch in. Then label all your food with a large piece of paper with your name in bold. If you catch footage of him either tampering with the camera or just stealing food, call the police but not the 911 number, call the non- emergency police number in your area. Build a case and likely your landlord would much rather evict him than deal with lawyers.",

At first it seemed crazy to have to do this but it paid off when he took a bunch of shit we hadn\u2019t even opened up and the food was just gone. He\u2019s such a piece of shit. The last time he was here he tried to intimidate my fiance thinking I wasn\u2019t here and got in her face and threatened to swing on her, the second I came flying out of our bedroom he dropped the toughguy routine and backed away from her and his attitude instantly changed because he knew I\u2019d swing on him in a heartbeat.

I don't really jerk off much because I have a girlfriend, but would probably do the same if I were in his position. Should I mention it to him since he obviously isn't getting any action? To be completely honest what would I even say? Another seperate thing is he recently bought a fleshlight and leaves it around in the shower, at first I didn't have a problem with it but recently I had a friend come over who saw it and mentioned it was weird, this sorta made me change my mind on it. Would I be an asshole if I asked him to pack it away somewhere else, but idk how those things work if they need to be washed and its easier to keep in the shower for that or whatever?\nHas anyone been in a similar circumstance ?",

I was cool with them and told them they could use it. They now have a jar of the same coffee. It was honestly as simple as that. We live in 2024, if you can\u2019t ask in person or feel uncomfortable you can always text and ask. Or at least give a heads up and be like \u201chey, I used some of your syrup, hope that\u2019s okay!\u201d",
            "I wish I could and that is definitely the plan for the next lease as college is almost over. I lived off campus with people and yeah we had our issues but it was never silly stuff like this tbvh. \nI moved to campus a year ago and had primarily applied for studios, this was my only option with roommates and this was the offer I got. \nSo either I had to take this (which is significantly cheaper than living off campus) or no longer be in line for a place on campus :(",
            "Gotta chase the salt with some sugar, if you catch my drift",
            "lol exactly what I was thinking",
            "Yes. Yes we are. If you don\u2019t get it, im guessing you\u2019re the type of person to use others stuff without asking them. \nAs I said in the post, if they would\u2019ve asked, I would\u2019ve never said no. I have absolutely never said no for anything - whether it\u2019s butter, flour, my expensive boots, my makeup, my clothes, my utensils. \nIf they\u2019d ask, I wouldn\u2019t say no. It\u2019s kept in the common area and is a part of the common stuff. Pretty sure that the type of stuff you use in the kitchen will be kept in the kitchen. If it\u2019s cheap enough for you to assume someone shouldn\u2019t be annoyed about it, it\u2019s definitely cheap enough for them to buy a bottle for themselves. Also, that\u2019s almost 1/4th of the syrup that\u2019s gone. That\u2019s definitely quite a bit.",
            "You're completely right. Im just giving you a diff perspective."

Like someones not even rinsing come on\"\n2. One time the sink was full and I took a photo and said \"come on guys\". I had a tray in there but most of it wasn't mine\n3. I said \"also can we agree on our dishes\"\n4. People kept leaving food in the sink and I texted \"can people stop leaving food in the sink? we have a trash for a reason\" and he pointed out i've left nugget crumbs/flower or put cardboard in the plastic bin. I admitted that was my bad and i'll be better and he said this after it was done.\n\nIn response one of my housemates has done the following each time:\n\n1. Saying he hopes someone kicks my teeth in and I bite their fingers and said he believes violence is the best way to resolve tension with roommates....over dishes\n2. Saying I won't find housemates as chill as this and was sure another housemate would have beaten me up by now before saying in all seriousness, he's surprised no one's suggested violence.\n3. Tagged another housemate in a comment saying a \"fight is loving\" when I asked about dishes\n4. Saying he seriously recommends violence with my housemates cuz he's \"worried\" I'll say the wrong thing to the wrong person and when I said his comments make me uncomfortable, his response was \"Just a suggestion in case your comments might drive someone over the edge\"\n5. Claims we could have used his coffee maker but he doesn't value any of our lives worth more than a bill and if we break it, we'll have problems\n6. And this was his \"apology\":\"I'm sorry if I made you feel like someone was going to fight you. I was just highlighting that your comments provoke.\"\n\nSo what do you guys say?",

            "They\u2019re trying to intimidate you so they can run the house I\u2019m guessing. These don\u2019t warrant violence at all. Occasionally my roommate and I get into petty verbal disagreements and I just walk away. If he texts me, I leave on read. It\u2019s just not worth ruining the relationship with someone I live with, for both of our peace. I\u2019m sure I can be better as a roommate too. I recommend finding others sometime soon, they seem like the type to put their hands on you."
