Judge Kathaleen [sic] McCormick believed that the board members were not sufficiently impartial. One of them, for example, was Musk's brother.\n\nIt's a fairly unusual ruling because it's essentially arguing that the shareholders were somehow negligent or incapable of making autonomous decisions. To be very blunt, she effectively called the shareholders morons. Everyone knew Kimbal Musk was Elon Musk's brother when they voted him onto the board. They chose to vote him in anyway.

            "When we started doing proactive bans based on participating in toxic subreddits we saw a **massive** uptick in ban evasions, which have died down a bit.\n\nWhat we're seeing now is a big uptick in users who are not regulars to the subreddit, triggering the \"Crowd Control\" feature, which largely trips when the users are new to the subreddits.  We're also seeing the hostility filters being tripped as well.\n\nA **very** large portion of *those* comments tend to be hostile towards Elon/Tesla.\n\nOften times we'll see things where we'll ban someone being hostile, and they'll fire back in modmail with \"I own three Teslas, and shares in the company.  *How dare you ban me!*.  These responses always amuse me because I *literally* don't care what your stake is in Tesla.  If you can't be respectful to other people, then you're banned.\n\nSome subreddits are made to be toxic from the start.  Rule 3 of the moderator code of conduct prevents us from calling them out, and permitting other folks to call them out.  I actually *just* banned someone from another subreddit for calling out a toxic subreddit.  Sucks, because they were probably a good user, but that's a **massive** liability to the subreddit, and it's not permitted.\n\n**Subreddits only turn toxic when the user base accepts that subreddits are toxic.**\n\nAs moderators, I perceive our function to be to ensure good, civil, discussions.  If you're going to be a douchebag to people, pro or anti Tesla, then your ass needs to go.\n\n*However*, we're only as effective as our userbase assists us to be.  We **cannot** be everywhere all at once, nor are we paid to be.  Once a subreddit accepts that subreddits \"just become toxic\", that's when things truly fall apart, because it means that the users are not using the report function that's built into Reddit.\n\n*Depending on the report function you use* things you report *always* hit the modqueue for us to act on.  Some of the options put it into the modqueue *and* send it to reddit proper for review.  *That's* where regular users can cause reddit wide suspensions for hostile users.\n\nBut if you're browsing, and using reddit all day long, and see hostile users and go \"Man, I wish someone would do something about all these assholes\", my man, **that person is you.**\n\nBut yes, the shit we're seeing is pretty wild.\n\n/u/jcfy (Since I'm responding to /u/rcnfive, but he's asking me to chime in to you)",

Ban.\n\nWe ask that folks wanting to talk about Elon Musk do so at /r/ElonMusk, which is a subreddit dedicated to that.\n\nAnd yes, bans work best.  Once a user is banned, we can leverage Reddit's ban evasion tools, which have been remarkably effective so far.\n\nIt sucks, and I hate it, because bans exclude people from the larger conversation, but if people won't follow the rules, and act hostile towards others, then ban",

            "As long as that's *actually* what it's getting used for.\n\nWe also see an issue where the moderators try to open up with the community on the issues we're having, as exampled above, and then the oppositional/toxic subreddits take the post and run off to their subreddits with it, and use it for targeted harassment and such, lol.\n\nIt's pretty obvious to figure out when it happens, because the posts will perform poorly, or we'll start getting pinged by users in the other subreddits and such, and at that point we report those things, because it isn't permitted, and the user accounts will start to be deleted, suspended, etc, etc.\n\nThe post you're saving has actually already been raised in an oppositional/toxic subreddit, and I was pinged to it.  It's *easily* one of the dumbest things to do, because I'll just go report the post as being harassment, which makes the user pick up a black mark on reddit's servers, and then I report the post itself for violating Rule 3 of the Moderator Code of Conduct, which is \"Respect your neighbors\".  Moderators are *not* permitted to allow posts which sully other subreddits, as it essentially becomes community interference and such.  Reddit frowns in that kind of behavior.  Once the report goes in, the moderators will advise the moderators to shape up, or be removed.\n\nIt's actually funny, because it's gotten so bad that some of the toxic/oppositional subreddits have had to pin posts that say \"Hey, look, we get it, you were banned, if you post about being banned, we're going to ban you too\".\n\nPeople are in such a rush to earn their \"I got banned!\" badge, and then brag about it, that they don't realize that they're putting the subreddit that they're bragging in at risk of being shot down.\n\nI *do not* like to ban.  Initially when I became a moderator here I'd spend a fair chunk of time reasoning with folks to have them understand that \"Look, you can't act like that here\", and I used to have pretty good success with it, but over the last year or so, *particularly* after the 3rd party apps were shut down, things just went to shit.\n\nThe toxicity levels started to climb, so we've had to change tactics now and then to try and overcome the issues.  A lot of it is through aggressive banning, but what we were starting to see is that for every person that we'd talk into not being a douchebag, they often had an alt account that they'd use to act like a douchebag with.  In some cases they come back and brag about it.\n\nNow we're starting to see an amusing issue where people we banned *months* ago are all of a sudden concerned with getting unbanned.  Like, they were banned back in April and they're hitting us up today \"Why was I banned?\", which obviously raises *massive* red flags, because if you're a regular user, you're going to ask why you were banned pretty quick.  Near as we can figure, the people we assume to be bots, are not in fact bots, but rather individuals who cycle through various accounts, and then post using those accounts.  So, someone might post as \"Bob2334\" on Mondays, and \"Timmy4501\" on Tuesdays, etc, etc, then they'd circle back a month later to an earlier account.\n\nThe *largest* connection point has **always** been participation in an oppositional/toxic subreddit, which sucks, because those subreddits *do* technically provide value, and I've worked with the moderators in the past to sort out some low level issues, but these days it's just reached a point where I don't feel like those moderators have things under control.  The irony is that I could probably help run those subreddits in a more effective fashion, while still keeping their intents.  There's nothing \"wrong\" with hating a thing, however, there's absolutely something wrong in attacking a thing.\n\nI don't like football, but I'm not out there trying to get people to stop playing football, or going to football stadiums, and trying to get the NFL shut down.  If some people want to like football, good on them, and let them have their fun.\n\nBut that's where the disconnect is. While I'm fine with not liking football and wanting nothing to do with it, while other people go play their football, there's other people who don't like baseball, and they're taking the time to stand in front of the stadiums and spew their hate to people who just want to watch a baseball game, and talk to others about baseball.  They'll stop at *nothing* until the stadiums are empty, and baseball stops being a sport that people play.\n\n*Those* are the people we're having issues with.  The \"I don't like it, so you're not allowed to like it either\" people.  It's the equivalent to having a bunch of Westboro Baptist Church zealots showing up and protesting your barbecue when you're just trying to shoot the shit with your buddies.\n\nAll the moderators of the oppositional/toxic subreddits have to do is clamp down on bad behavior, and all this infighting should stop, and I'd be more than willing to help them with their automods to achieve that objective.\n\nBut, I don't see that happening because people are looking for a place to hate on things, and if you clamp down on bad behavior, then those users will go start/find another subreddit so they can continue there.  We've already seen it happen.  One oppositional/toxic subreddit got slapped by Reddit, and the users started making panicked posts with alternative subreddits that they'd just spun up so they could continue their hate/toxicity.\n\n[The solution, however, is very simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d6W2AsinCs)",

I imagine we'll see v13 go to HW4, and that'll be the start of the bifurcation process.  Anyone with v12 will have HW3, anyone with a higher version than 12 will have HW4.\n\nThat's supposition on my part though.",

            "If you are the original owner of an FSD enabled vehicle, then you can transfer that to a new car\n\nOnly that time, never again",
            "Correct.\n\nPeople who want a perpetual FSD license are, honestly, out of their damned minds.  If you want a perpetual license, just pay $100 a month.  Based on some statements Elon made, I think they're leaning in that direction anyways.\n\nFSD is going to be a thing that's continually developed, like Windows.  You can't just sell it once and never pay for it again, and continue to reap the benefits of having FSD on your car.\n\nThe *closest* thing Tesla could do is let you have a \"perpetual license\" to a specific version of FSD, in this case I'll say v12, because it's pretty capable.  Then if/when v13 comes out, you'd have to pay an \"upgrade fee\" to get the next version.\n\nAlternatively, you could pay an \"upgrade fee\" to transfer FSD to the next car, and frankly *that's* the option people should be pushing for.\n\nIf FSD was a perpetual license with free transfers, *everyone* would buy it, and it'd likely never get the funding they need for it, because people would buy it the one time, and at that point, why sell it, just bake it into the cost of the car.\n\nUpgrade fees make more sense because it encourages people to stay with FSD, because they'll be more likely to stay with Tesla if it means cheap self-driving.\n\nTesla's got a bunch of early adopters.  As more companies release their self-driving equivalents, they'll be able to undercut Tesla's price because Tesla's price is the one to beat, however, Tesla can encourage people to stay loyal to the brand by letting them upgrade FSD for less than whatever the competitors are selling theirs for.\n\nWhich is, essentially, the same thing Microsoft did with their upgrade versions of Windows",
            "I think v12 is going to be the upper limit of HW3 and v13 is being reserved for HW4.\n\nThis would also explain why Elon keeps telling people to ignore the 12 in v12 and focus on the .3, .4, .5, etc.",
            "RIP HW4 on my 24 M3",
            "I was thinking the same too. It would be a nice double upgrade to wait for.",

            "Which is odd considering that he said that you should invest only if you believe in FSD. One would expect salesman to know what he is selling.",
            "Yes but if your car is part of the network like Elon envisions where you can put it on the network for a week or longer, how do you handle that? How are you made aware of the damage and how do you know who to go bill? \n\nWith Uber there is a driver in the car that monitors this and I assume Tesla could use the in cabin camera but the question is still who cleans the car while it's part of the network if, say, I let the car be part of the network while I'm away on holiday for the week?",
            "And after repeated vandalizing, which you may not even notice after it\u2019s been driving around all day, who pays for that? What if someone pukes and the camera doesn\u2019t catch it and the next person doesn\u2019t notice?  Where to Tesla owned robotaxis go to get cleaned and charged?",
            "If you sold a car with FSD enabled would the new owner get to keep that capability?",
            "No, but the roads will also have to adapt. Ultimately, autonomy will work better when all cars are autonomous.",

If you want to detect debris or small objects at similar or higher speeds, you also need to have way more resolution.

Waymo only works on geofenced areas with ludicrously high-definition maps pre-prepared, and requires a car covered all over in bulky, ugly after-market sensors.\n\nTesla's \"self driving\" (increasingly) works more or less anywhere there's a road, and requires nothing to be added to the car after purchase. \n\nThey're completely different systems with completely different use-cases, and each of them is significantly better than the other in different areas.",

            "It has difficulty properly reading signs (example speed limits vs highway markers) so resolution seems lacking. Also cameras do not have full 360 binocular coverage yet. Finally most cameras do not clean or heat so are not robust.",
            "I completely agree with this. Cameras currently already\"see\" better at night than humans. The resolution on the newest vehicles is good enough imo. Of course as camera just keep getting better and cheaper there will be no reason not to continuously upgrade them.\n\n\nThe camera placement and quantity, lack of redundancy, and lack of cleaning ability are the biggest issues I currently have with Teslas approach - all easily fixable imo.\n\n I think the front and rear facing cameras are probably fine, as is the rear fender facing camera. Id just say the rear 3 need some way to clean themselves. Also I really don't see the downside of like adding 2 more cameras at the rear corners (either in the taillights or in the rear window or something) as redundancy/emergency usage. For the front 3 cameras, I think they are fine, but as you said front facing camera or two in the grill or in the lights would be good. Or even better would be at the corner (probably bottom would be easiest) of the windshield, because that leads to by far biggest problem with Teslas camera placement.\n\nThe B pillar camera that is supposed to see cross traffic is imo by far the largest issue and it's not even close. I think the  placement further behind the driver's head is just bad. I think there needs to be two cameras at that angle further forward on the car. Those b pillar cameras can still be there for redundancy, but there should absolutely be cameras in the headlights or in the top or ideally bottom corner of the front windshield (in area where wipers cover/clean). This would 100% make me more confident in cross traffic scenarios.\n\nThe last minor and short term issue I have is interior camera. It just isn't a good placement for driver monitoring imo.\n\nOverall Id say if they JUST  added 2 more cameras in the front corners of the vehicle facing like 45 degrees out, id have very little issues.",

            "Silverado EV weighs just under 9000 lbs, to the Cybertruck's 6800 lbs. All of your math is an unfair comparison without including that context. Cybertruck would not get 550 - 570 miles of range with the same battery, because its weight would go up significantly from the additional cells plus likely structural reinforcement required. Probably it would get similar range to the Silverado EV.\n\nIf you scale Wh/mi by weight, Silverado EV takes about 4% less power per mile per lb. Silverado EV is more aerodyamic with a Cd of 0.331, vs 0.34 (published) or 0.384 (third-party tested) for the Cybertruck. Which roughly accounts for a similar 5%ish reduction in power consumption. So all in all, they probably have similar powertrain efficiency.\n\nEV trucks SHOULD have big, heavy, oversized batteries. Silverado EV can tow a load of several thousand pounds much further than a Cybertruck can before recharging.\n\nNow, casual drivers who don't haul heavy cargo and don't go off-road purchasing a truck at all, is an entirely different problem. Cybertruck having a smaller battery is fine for those drivers, Silverado EV is even more of a waste on them.

            "> Cybertruck would not get 550 - 570 miles of range with the same battery, because its weight would go up significantly from the additional cells plus likely structural reinforcement required.\n\nI know, and I account for this. If you didn\u2019t account for the added mass, it would be 570 miles. I say \u201cmight be 550-570\u201d because of the added mass from the massive battery.\n\n> If you scale Wh/mi by weight\n\nWhy would you? Weight isn\u2019t a good thing. A vehicle that is heavier than it needs to be is poorly engineered.\n\n> EV trucks SHOULD have big, heavy, oversized batteries. Silverado EV can tow a load of several thousand pounds much further than a Cybertruck can before recharging.\n\nThis is actually a fair argument. My only counter would be that I think an oversized battery such as the Silverado\u2019s will make it very difficult if not impossible to profitably produce the vehicle. To be frank, I don\u2019t think we will see the Silverado EV, at least not in its current spec, around for very long or in much volume for exactly this reason.\n\n> Cybertruck having a smaller battery is fine for those drivers\n\nEven then it\u2019s way too big of a battery for those drivers.",

            "The Cybertruck went from a double stacked battery design to a single stack, so it actually could get the range they originally hoped for, but it seems the volume of cell manufacturing isn't yet available with Tesla and other companies combined for it to make sense to build it with a huge battery. 4680 volume is split between Semi, Cybertruck, Model Y and possibly Robotaxi vehicle and Roadster and possibly all their upcoming vehicles. 1 double stacked Cybertruck battery pack would be enough batteries for 3.5 Model Ys, profit per cell would go way father with Model Y especially with the volume Model Y sells at. I'm surprised then didn't just delay one more year until they hit a proper volume."
