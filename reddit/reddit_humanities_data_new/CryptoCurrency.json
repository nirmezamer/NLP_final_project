            "Waiting for this",
            "I've read your White Paper, and I understand your decentralization is adaptive and works on different scales, and lies on different L2s. Whereas the L1 is purely taking care of the security. \n\nAnd if I understand right, you have L2s that specialize more in speed and scalability priority, are more efficient at dealing with things like smart contracts, but you have L2s focusing on stronger decentralization. \n\nWhat mechanism is in place to ensure an L2 has stronger decentralization priority? Realistically, what is the level of decentralization we can expect from the more decentralized L2? How would that level of decentralization stack up against other major decentralized chains?",
            "Glue looks interesting! When is the testnet and are there incentives for using the chain?",
            "The concept sounds cool. But why are the founders semi anonymous? Is it cause of privacy or security reasons?\n\nAnd when can we expect an app to be available for it to be tested? A four year timeline is pretty long.",
            "What's the difference between $GLUE and $EPOXY and why should HODLers stick with it?",
            "Hi, thanks for holding AMA.\n\nQuestion: what makes glue better pro trading analytical platform than other platforms in the industry? \n\nAlso on-chain customer service excites me more, can you tell us more about the customer experience?",
            "Marked my calendar",
            "It seems like a very cool platform. In a world there some argue there are far too many tokens, how does creating a token add value to your platform & users?",
            "How many Glue tokens are there and what percentage is owned by insiders and early investors?\n\nIn other words, whose bags will be pumping if I choose to get involved with yet another layer 1 blockchain that\u2019s promising to revolutionize the industry?",

            "Best wishes to the team, that were working on the project for the last 3 years. A few questions for you that I got after checking your website.\n\n1. You have been working on this project for 3 years and almost 3 years ago the alts market went downwards and still have not reached the same heights. What were the pros and cons of creating a project in such a hard time?\n\n2. If the \"alt season\" does not happen, how it will effect your long time goals with the project or it has the minimum effect on it?\n\n3. You compare yourself with other CEX like Binance or Kraken, but the coins are still stored on our wallets. Why do you think people would trust in your project more than in Binance for example?\n\nThank you and best of luck to all of the team",
            "Why do you think there \\*hasn't\\* been a huge push from crypto companies historically to appeal non-crypto native people?   \n  \nThings are still clunky and impossible to understand. Even on the UI side there's only a handful of platforms that are half-decent looks wise but still insane to use with words like \"seed phrase\" and stuff. Like why would anyone put money in a place like that?? Even explainers are still wicked confusing, like you need a crypto dictionary to understand half of this stuff \ud83d\ude24",
            "Hello founders!\n\nWhat incentives are there for developers to build on Glue's platform, and how does Glue plan to support and nurture its developer community in the long run?",
            "Why the name Glue?",
            "Classic question: Could your technology, if proven superior, be integrated into other L1 networks like ETH? Or are there fundamental reasons that make this very hard?",
            "What would you say is Glue's MAIN value proposition compared to other Layer 1 blockchains? What is the thing that sets you apart?",
            "As someone pretty new to the crypto world my question would be\n\nWhy would someone prefer to invest in GLUE over other coins like tether and link? How will GLUE hold up in a year or so. I know volatility goes hand in hand with crypto but do you guys have any long term plans",
            "Is there a specific reason you build three L2 networks on top of your L1 network? Are they technically identical or are there differences?",
            "If I understand this correctly, you have your own L1 blockchain with your own L2 networks on top of it, and some very nice solution for cross chain interactions.\n\nCan other networks benefit from your security technology or is it exclusive to your networks? If yes, could this be used to create better bridges for existing projects without migrating to new contracts?",
            "Glue Hub Analytics seem very decent. So if i have any token or else method, any chance to receive extractable data reports or more notifications?",
            "You offer an insurance as far as I can see, but I can't find many details on it.\n\nHow exactly does it work and what does it cover? If the insurance covers personal wallet hacks, how do you ensure people aren't faking a hack to exploit the system?",

            "How is this project that raised $5 million valued at $1.4 billion?",
            "First of all thanks for coming on here.\n\nThe question I have is in regards to the tokenomics of the project? What is the distribution, max supply, inflation rate etc?",

            "Thanks for sharing the project! Love the surprise of this and the design/organization of Glue. Does the hub do anything additional to combat scam/spam that may be targeted at users within this ecosystem? \n\nI like the idea of simplicity as it appeals to less experienced users and isn't as daunting for them. But I'm also glad that there are some in-depth tools as well. I assume there will also be a learning section within the hub if I want to learn about different chains and how they operate?",
            "What sets apart Glue from the competition?\n\nDoes having Ogle as a founder contribute to part of this?\n\nI'm hoping this would translate into it being harder for scammers to attack people on Glue?",
            "What are the incentives for developers to build on your chain? Do you have a grant program? What are you doing to combat MEV?",
            "Why hasn't there been an industry push to make things less complicated overall? This doesn't seem to be priority and I don't understand. Even \"user-friendly\" exchanges still use language no one can understand, most design is hideous.",
            "How will token distribution be done fairly and in a way that maintains true decentralization? In the face of recent airdrops much of the crypto space has been revealed to be decentralization theater and I am pretty over it.\u00a0",

            "Considering AI as one of the biggest trends in modern history, are there any plans to take advantage of AI to improve the blockchain?",
            "Thanks for holding this AMA.\n\nHere my question:\n\nWhat advantages does Glue provide than the competence doesn't? What makes you a better choice?",
            "Mmmm....seems to be pretty centralised for a defi project..\ud83e\uddd0",
            "what are you gluing?",
            "Hey there! Interesting resume for the coin itself, it's gotten me quite interested in project as a whole. I have a more personal financial side as I love hearing about this personally. When building a company in the Crypto sphere what are the main challenges you have to face? Is it typically a more expensive dev team due to a \"somewhat\" newer technology? Is it on the legal side and having to make sure there's a strong regulatory framework behind your coin? Is there a hiring issue when it comes to bear markets vs. bull markets? \n\n  \nsimilarly, what made you think of the word \"Glue\" for the company / coin? Is it to \"be the blue\" that holds everything together? Interesting project and now on my radar for sure.",
            "You have raised around $4M, why do you think your valuation is so high compared to others like ZKSync who raised a lot more than that?\n\nWhat do you think $GLUE brings compared to others that will make it stand out? There are dozens of new tokens and coins every day and it\u2019s so easy to get drowned\n\nHow will the TGE be distributed? Are you doing an airdrop and who is eligible?",

            "What separates your shitcoin from the 1000s of other shitcoins?",
            "Their L1 is really about their L2s.\n\nIt uses XCM, a cross-consensus system where you no longer need bridging, there's no longer a gap or friction with the L2s. It's an entire interconnected ecosystem with the L2s. The security is all done on L1, but it's no longer bogged down with smart contract and all that running on L1. All that stuff is on L2s. So the L1 works faster and more efficiently. And they have multiple L2s catering for different needs. Some for speed and scalability, some for higher decentralization.\n\nGabe, this is the future man.\n\nIf the trilemma can't be solved directly on a single L1, this is how you solve it indirectly.",
            "Love this question. First and crucial to understand, since this works differently from other blockchains, is this: Security (making sure any transaction is true and valid) is done by the L1 for all L2s. No L2 can submit an invalid transaction; the L1 will bounce it back. The set of validators on L1 will be large to ensure a highly secure network.\n\nUnlike other platforms, censorship resistance is determined by the number of sequencers an L2 has. For example, we think censorship resistance is less crucial on the Gaming L2 than on the Finance L2. In this example, we could have only 5 sequencers for the Gaming L2, yet 100 of them for the Finance L2. That means if there is one bad actor that censors you on the Gaming L2, each block you'd have a 20% chance of being censored (it would eventually go through but maybe take some time), whereas on the Finance L2, you'd have a 1/100 chance of being censored, and the odds of it going through on the next block, 6 seconds later, would be very high.\n\nThe ability to separate censorship resistance from security is crucial for performance on something like the Gaming L2. The 5 sequencers could be running on absolutely beastly hardware to ensure speed and cheap transactions. For your money, though, you'd rather deal with some tradeoffs, and therefore the Finance L2 will be slower, more expensive, yet also a lot more censorship-resistant.\n\nSo, to sum up, the level of decentralization on our more decentralized L2s, like the Finance L2, is designed to be highly competitive with major decentralized chains. By having 100+ sequencers (this won't happen from day 1), we aim to provide a level of decentralization that ensures robust censorship resistance while maintaining security through the L1 validators. This adaptive approach allows us to optimize each L2 for its specific use case, balancing speed, cost, and censorship resistance as needed.",
            "We've had an internal Dev Net live since mid-2022 and launched a Test Net several weeks ago. However, because we didn't have super good documentation ready and we are still continuously upgrading it (which frequently means issues due to code changes, etc.), we didn't make it public and instead only gave it to partners that are actively building on it.\n\nThere WILL be a public test net, but we've decided to focus on getting Main Net live first. This is because a public Test Net would require a meaningful amount of resources to answer questions for Test Net users and developers, resources that we'd have to take away from the Main Net work. We are currently in the process of getting it stood up.\n\nBut don't be alarmed, since this is a pre-public Test Net, no rewards or anything will accrue to anyone until it becomes public. We're big believers in fair an equal access!",
            "For me, it's mainly because I travel a lot and value personal privacy. It\u2019s not particularly hard to figure out who I am\u2014I haven\u2019t gone out of my way to hide my identity. But in the meantime, it\u2019s nice to maintain some level of privacy!\n\nAs for the timeline, we started 3 years ago and are on track to launch in Q3 of this year (so a few weeks from now)! So, the wait is almost over, and we\u2019re excited to get it into your hands soon.",
            "If you see what I've been doing in the industry for the past couple of years, you might expect there are a few bad people who don't love me out there, so I try to stay semi anonymous. That said, I did speak at Consensus a couple of weeks ago, and will be speaking at token2049 in a couple of months, and am known personally by hundreds of people in crypto since I've been around for about 12 years now... so, I'm findable, but I'm not trying to advertise my address exactly.\n\nSecondly, I'd just say that the biggest rugs or scams we can all think of were by super doxed founders (SBF with FTX, Mashinsky with Celsius, and many others). I'm 0% convinced that a super doxed founding team is the key to not getting screwed. There are other things you can rely on for ease of mind, and we're trying to give those as much as we possibly can over time.",
            "I generally prefer single component adhesives for ease of use, so definitely go with $GLUE!",
            "The token is the \"gas\" of all of the chains, it's voting, and a couple of other things. It's a utility token for the network.",
            "For full tokenomics, please check out section 4 in the whitepaper! We've been extremely capital efficient and haven't raised any major VC money, meaning you won't be pumping their bags at the very least. The lowest price anyone was able to buy the tokens is $0.253 for Seed Round investors. The average price paid in the LBP was $0.668, and if I recall correctly, the highest price was $1.45. So there's no one that is 100X up or anything even remotely like that.\n\nThere ARE founders' tokens (both founders also invested $500,000 in the Seed round on the same terms as other seed investors, so we have two tranches), but they have a long-term lockup and are meant to align incentives with token holders.\n\nSo, compared to basically any other project I can think of, there's no one poised to dump on you at 100X from day one!",
            "1 Billion supply cap with 15% allocated to the founders, and 10% to the Glue Foundation for operational funds.",
            "Moon soon",
            "Thanks for having us!",
            "Hope we get to collaborate in more ways as time goes on \ud83d\ude09",
            "Hey, thanks for the interest! Right now, there is zero customer support for anything on-chain, with maybe the exception of Telegram and Discord servers, but those tend to be hugely overrun with scammers.\n\nOne of our basic thesis is this: When you shop for a bank or a telco provider, what is one of the most important things you look for? For most people, the answer is great customer support. Quite frankly, I couldn't care less about a bank's tiny bit better APR on deposits if the customer support sucks and I have to spend hours trying to get through some shitty automated phone system every time I have an issue. We believe this will hold true in crypto in the long term as well, and it has already played out that way given that basically everyone has just stuck to CEXs since they do have customer support (granted, not always exceptional).\n\nAt the core, Glue believes that the rest of the world will not adopt on-chain crypto if there is no customer support. We HAVE to fix this. Our service layer will incentivize third-party service providers to offer products, including customer support, as a great way to unbundle TradFi's offerings so that everyone can choose what level of support they need but still have good support available to those who want it.\n\nBy integrating customer service directly into the blockchain ecosystem, we can provide a more seamless and secure experience for users. No more worrying about scammers or unreliable sources of help. Instead, users can have access to professional, reliable support whenever they need it, which is a crucial step towards mainstream adoption of crypto.\n\nThere's a whole section in the white paper on this topic as well!",
            "1. We were pretty lucky to be building during that market downturn. We raised funds right before the market dropped, so we were in a strong cash position. The dip actually gave us the time to carefully pick the right technology, run several proof-of-concept developments, and get close to launching our Main Net. While it\u2019s always nice to move quickly, having that extra time helped us improve the quality of the product we\u2019re about to launch and set us up for long-term success.\n\n2. As someone with a portfolio heavily invested in alts, I really hope it does happen, lol. From a Glue perspective, we're confident we'll have a strong launch and deliver a solid product that attracts a lot of users beyond just poaching from other L1s. We're well differentiated with a more resilient and market-decorrelated strategy. A bull market would definitely be more fun and helpful, but we're prepared and okay either way.\n\n3. This is a great question for sure. First off, as someone who really believes in the future of self-custody (combined with better tools and services) and decentralization, I would love for the answer to be that people everywhere will recognize the genius of blockchain and switch because they inherently know it's better (aka the trad crypto strategy).\n\nBut, as someone who's run several companies and been heavily involved in marketing, I think the above, while nice, has basically no chance of happening on its own. I believe we can build and deliver a product that is more fun to use, as easy or easier than a CEX, and offers better rewards. Combined with a really strong user acquisition program, I'm confident we can attract a huge number of people who want to join what crypto was always meant to be, instead of just gambling on CEXs.\n\nWhile the benefits of decentralization are largely not understood by many retail users, it allows us to build a truly borderless and global product that can deliver significant benefits to people everywhere. Crypto is the system of the future, but it needs to be easy to use to be accessible to everyone. That's what Glue will deliver.",
            "Naming everything with the seeming goal of being as confusing as possible is for sure my largest pet peeve about the industry. If we'd just called Seed Phrases \"Passwords\" instead, everyone would have understood from the get-go that sharing it with random people on Discord probably isn't the right move. \ud83d\ude02",
            "Tbh we're kind of looking at it the other way around from the beginning. We started by saying \"rather than try to pander do devs and get them to build products that hopefully attract consumers, we'll build the basic products ourselves at a very high quality, and set that standard. Then when users come, the devs will come and went to build and improve upon what we've made.\"\n\nIt's sort of the initial Apple approach in some ways where the iPhone had a solid enough Maps app, solid enough browser, etc, but they set the standard high (then implemented the app store) for others to build on since so many users were coming to happy because of the much-improved user experience of the iPhone.",
            "Wynaut\n\nActually it used to be named Atera, after our favorite restaurant, but we changed it to Glue after the Terra Luna fiasco.\n\nThink of glue in real life - you can have fun with it (crafts as a kid for example), you can use it for practical purposes every day at the office, and you can use industry or medical grade glue to do super serious things that peoples' lives depend on.\n\nAnd obviously Glue keeps us connected :-)",
            "Hey that all depends on what you mean with integrated! Glue will not settle back to ETH like other L2's for example and that would not work from a technical perspective. BUT we are very focused on providing an outstanding omni chain experience as we aim to compete with CEX's more so than other L1's and certainly want to list tokens from all chains, not just native tokens, so in that way we will be very well integrated and bridged.",
            "I'll break this apart a little bit.\n\nCore Value Proposition to Developers: We will have Users! Our goal is to acquire the largest on-chain user base by far in crypto. If we can \"steal\" even a tiny bit of market share from all the CEXs by having a great product that is equally easy to use, we will be bigger than Ethereum. Generally, developers like to build cool products for users so their creations actually end up being useful.\n\nSo we are inverting the usual pyramid. Other networks do it this way: Step 1: Build cool tech. Step 2: Attract developers and pay them to build cool stuff. Step 3: Hope that somehow users will find your network and those cool dApps and use them.\n\nGiven the lack of widespread adoption, Step 3 clearly hasn't worked out so far.\n\nWhat Glue is doing: Step 1: Build cool tech, including a dApp stack that provides all the basics. Step 2: Attract users through traditional marketing and customer acquisition methods (e.g., we'll give you $10 of Glue if you refer a friend, etc.). Step 3: Those users will attract developers because there\u2019s someone to build cool stuff for.\n\nThat's why the Apple App Store has a HUGE amount of people building for it, and I can't even recall what the Microsoft version used to be called. It all boils down to adoption and users. \n\nValue Proposition for Retail Users and Institutions: I'll tag u/ogleFromGlue here to give you his amazing hamburger buns analogy!",
            "If you are currently using Tether for payments or storing value then the GLUE token would definitely be the wrong choice to replace that! Given that it's a gas token, the price will be too volatile. BUT we will have an ecosystem native, fully crypto-collateralized USD pegged stablecoin as well. That's what you'd want to use for day-to-day payments.\n\nHaving a well-established and reliable stablecoin (and in the future, multiple of them in multiple currencies) is a huge must-have in my opinion. I love BTC as an asset, but I don't think it's particularly practical as a currency, and the same goes for GLUE.",
            "Yes! Loads of good reasons! If you want a deep dive on this, please check out the technology section in our Whitepaper on the [Glue.net](http://Glue.net) website.\n\nFirst, three L2s is just the starting point and we hope to have many more in the future. The idea is this: On Ethereum, L2s are all relatively the same. You can execute the same code on Optimism as you can on Arbitrum and their are parameterized similarly as well. That has lots of benefits, but also major downsides scalability-wise. Both Optimism and Arbitrum are generically optimized, meaning they aren\u2019t custom-built for any specific use case.\n\nThat's where Glue is different. The core concept is this: Different transactions have different needs. For example, if you are submitting a $100,000 deposit to a lending protocol to avoid being liquidated, you probably care only about one thing: getting it there FAST. You don't care if you pay $0.01 in fees or $100. But you NEED it to be reliable and there can not be any congestion. Generically optimized blockchains don\u2019t handle this super well. For example, on Solana, because it is amazingly inexpensive (an incredible accomplishment), it also means there's a LOT of low-value transactions going through the same network you are trying to submit a really high value transaction to, which can jam things up when there\u2019s a huge spike in transactions submitted.\n\nOn Glue, we'll have a Finance L2. It will not be nearly as cheap as Solana, and that's on purpose. It\u2019ll have a minimum transaction fee, probably in the $0.05 to $0.20 range, depending on use (and of course, this can be changed through a public vote), that is meant to deter people from deploying a game on that chain. The idea is to make it pricier so that transactions that don\u2019t need as high reliability as financial transactions move to other L2s, like our Gaming L2. That one won't have any minimum transaction fees and will be optimized (smaller set of sequencers with much higher hardware requirements) for being super fast and super cheap. In the long run, when Glue really gets a lot of traction, we could even add a second Finance L2 with even much higher fees for ultra large and time sensitive transactions.\n\nWhile the above doesn\u2019t \"solve\" the scalability trilemma, it gives us much larger headroom for scaling and prioritizing the true needs of each transaction. Moving away from generically optimized Layer 2s is critical, in my opinion. This really only works for Glue because all the L2s use the same base token, Glue, so they don\u2019t have any incentive to compete with each other like L2s on Ethereum or Polkadot do. Quite the opposite\u2014it allows us to launch new ones that take volume off previous ones in ways that are more optimal for users and developers.",
            "Correct, we have an L1 that provides security (no smart contracts on L1) and then a whole set of L2s that are use-case optimized. The L2\u2019s are interconnected with a protocol that allows for message passing between them natively, without the need for third-party bridges.\n\nFor the time being, the L2s will initially be built by the Foundation. In the future, and given alignment with the team and vision\u2014and of course, with the appropriate votes from all token holders\u2014we might allow other teams to build L2s. People could certainly deploy L3s permissionlessly on our L2s as well, so there are many ways to build on and around Glue's core tech stack.\n\nThe idea is to have a more focused product vision and development strategy than many other crypto projects. I personally do not think the \"anarchy approach\" is an ideal roadmap for developing technology. There are certainly upsides to it, but through Glue's run-time code upgrades, most of the decentralization challenges that come with having an organized product roadmap are mitigated.",
            "Thanks!! For those who haven't seen it yet, please check out at: [hub.Glue.net](http://hub.Glue.net)\n\nWe are really just getting started. I\u2019ve been keen on building an improved version of CMC for quite a while because I really wanted one for myself, and this was a great opportunity. In case people are wondering why we started with that, there are two key reasons:\n\nQuick to Launch: We were able to build and launch it while finalizing on-chain code audits, etc. We felt that showing people what we meant by \"good UX\" was critical since it\u2019s very easy to say that and very hard to actually deliver.\n\nMarketing Advantage: Probably most importantly, the Hub will become a major part of our advertising strategy. The more people we can familiarize with the Glue brand and attract them to the Hub, the more we can convert to Glue on-chain users in the long run. So the Market Overview is effectively a (very nice, public good) Trojan horse. Please help us get the message out there so that people know there is a better, easier-to-use alternative available. We will keep these tools public and free long-term and continue to implement lots of UX improvements (for example, you\u2019ll be able to have different custom table column settings for mobile than for desktop\u2014a missing feature on CMC that has been bugging me for years).\n\nOn the analytics side: Absolutely, we want to help people manage their crypto in one easy place (Debank style), and of course, we won\u2019t be shy about nudging them that if they bridged their assets to Glue and, for example, deposited them in our lending platform, they could earn more yield. Building tools to make crypto easier to understand and manage (including notifications and alerts) will be a major focus for us on the Hub in general. Our long-term goal is to make it so good that whenever someone needs something related to their portfolio, the Glue Hub is the first place they go.",
            "There isn't an insurance per se, but we have two things you might be referring to.\n\nOne is the Glue Security Fund - this is a fund set aside (from tiny fees in a per tx basis) to do things related to security on the chain. That includes *us* having projects audited who come to Glue (we see an inherent conflict of interest in projects always having their own code audited), and a budget to chase down people who steal money/rug/whatever on Glue. I've done a large amount of fund recoveries from hacks myself (if you google my name and crypto you'll probably come across a few), and we'd use similar or more aggressive means to chase anyone who does the same on our network.\n\nYou may also be thinking about our service layer, which could be utilized by a third party to be paid on a per tx basis for insurance. You could, as a user, opt in to sending $x for every transaction of a certain kind you do, over to a third party insurance company, who then would insure your transaction to the extent you've come to an agreement with them to do so.",
            "Yes, the L2's are on independent tech stacks, if one of them were to stall or get overloaded, the other ones would continue producing blocks without any issues. The L1 prioritizes the L2's equally and because most of the hard work is done by the L2 sequencers, most of the work is offloaded to them, meaning the L1 can validate 100+ L2's (although we'd have to scale massively to get even close to needing that).",
            "Math basically\n\nWe did a round a couple of years ago at a non-valued price, but at a discount to the next round. The next round raised via an lbp and ended at $1.41b. This wasn't our choosing, it wasn't priced by us, it was priced by those who purchased the tokens themselves.\n\nI'm not totally sure if this is what you're asking, so if not let me know. If your implication is \"to build a big company you've got to raise loads of cash from vcs,\" I'd say that's fundamentally untrue and is a core point we're trying to show to not be true. If you look at top 50 coins, some are hot shot vc coins that did big raises, but a whole lot of them aren't. Don't be fooled by the marketing machine of the past year and a half or so into thinking there's only one pathway to success here.",

            "I think crypto is just following the same trajectory almost all user-facing new technologies/industries follow.\n\nFirst you get the tech innovators who are essentially the equivalent of gigabrains who forge the trail, create the initial innovations that have the potential to shift the paradigm, etc. These aren't typically also people who are the most focused on how to make things actually useful to everyday people - their interest is often in the tech itself, or business itself, and they'd prefer to let others figure out how to make it useful. Think - the folks who invented point to point protocol, or udp, or http, or whatever else.\n\nThen you've got the initial couple waves of people who try to build on that and do a fine job but not great. Think of text based web browsers for example.\n\nThen the next crew comes in and thinks \"ok, most people aren't nerds who want to just look at text when they browse the web. Most want pictures and an easy interface,\" and at that point you get things like Mosaic + Netscape (co created by Marc Andreesen of a16z btw) - when techy people try to take humans into account from a user experience point of view.\n\nThen the industry really takes off and you end up with serious innovations on ux, security, etc.\n\nSo the tldr here is it's just part of the process. It starts one way, and ends up where we're headed to now. My opinion is we at Glue are building and have built part of that next generation, the \"Firefox\" or \"Google Chrome\" phase if we're using the analogies above. Hopefully you all agree once more of our products and chain itself are out there for you to check out.",
            "We're pretty over it too. Our whitepaper talks a good bit about tokenomics and token distribution, but some things aren't ironed out totally yet. Most are though and you can see them there.\n\nWorking systems usually have a balance of things that centralized and decentralized, and often there's a transition period from more centralized to less. Our genuine interest is in most cases to offset the centralization itself into the community's hands (read about how we're doing votes for example), so we'll do our best to implement that.",
            "That's certainly meant to be re-list, not resist \ud83d\ude05. From a tech perspective, via partner bridges! We of course won't be able to cover truly every NFT, but we will be able to integrate many of the large NFT market places and then automatically bridge the NFT's to Glue after they are purchased by the user.",
            "We definitely use AI tools to help with development as well as for security auditing. No real plans at this point to go beyond that, we\u2019ll stay laser focused on our product vision. If eventually there\u2019s a great AI use case that fits our roadmap we\u2019d love to jump on board!",
            "I will take this as a question about our governance process! \n\nWe utilize what's called runtime upgrades. Unlike Ethereum, where upgrading to a new version of the network requires validators to opt-in, Glue's protocol can upgrade itself seamlessly and without hard forks. Here\u2019s a simplified version of our process:  \n  \nStep 1: Someone writes new code they want the network to adopt (this applies to both L1 and L2, while dApps have a different process).  \n  \nStep 2: The code is uploaded to the network, triggering a public vote by all Glue token holders.  \n  \nStep 3: If the vote passes, the network automatically upgrades to the new code without any need or possibility for human intervention.\n\nThis means that upgrades are forkless and automated, similar to how Tezos and Polkadot operate. It ensures a smooth and decentralized upgrade process.\n\nGiven that our current development team is small (a common scenario for new projects), this governance model ensures that a small set of developers can move rapidly and work much quicker but there is accountability through token votes. Founders' proposals also need to pass a token holder vote, maintaining a fair process.\n\nFor DeFi, upgrades follow a more traditional path, aligning with how most DeFi projects manage updates.\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned that \"having a roadmap and a vision\" might be less decentralized than waiting for spontaneous developments, I get that. However, our structured approach with runtime upgrades allows us to maintain direction and innovation while ensuring decentralized governance through token holder votes. This balances vision with true decentralization, mitigating potential negatives.",
            "Ahhh, see it's not about what you are Glueing, it's all about the Glue you sniff along the way...",
            "The valuation was set by an LBP (Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool), which is a bit of a confusing name since we didn't use it to bootstrap liquidity but rather to raise contributions. Essentially, it\u2019s market-based pricing, so what people were willing to pay for the token, and that's why we chose that model.\n\nAs for the amount raised, being capital efficient has been a huge focus for us. We very much did not want to raise absurd sums of money and end up with VCs owning huge chunks of the network, causing long-term challenges of them selling into retail. We were fortunate to leverage a lot of open-source software, allowing us to build an innovative tech stack and a set of dApps without having to reinvent everything from scratch. This unique assembly of parts has given us a competitive edge and a unique product while having probably one of the best tokenomics in the market. For details and tokenomics please check out our Whitepaper on Page 33 and after: [https://docsend.com/view/igx56wrsh53ckcbe](https://docsend.com/view/igx56wrsh53ckcbe)\n\nAs Glue grows, we will certainly raise additional funding to build more features, support marketing efforts, and potentially make acquisitions. However, all these future funding efforts will be approved through community voting, ensuring that we remain aligned with the interests of our token holders and the broader community.",
            "Part 2: I think a crucial part is, of course, the product (but as the product guy, I\u2019d obviously say that), and we'll cover that in more detail in other answers. So, let me touch on another critical point: user acquisition. Both u/ogleFromGlue and I have a LOT of direct-to-consumer marketing expertise.\n\nUser acquisition will be a crucial part of Glue's vision to achieve real adoption, and there aren\u2019t too many people with our level of expertise in this area. As the last 10+ years have shown, people won\u2019t simply show up just because you build it. Even Ethereum, despite its huge success and valuation, has less than 500,000 on-chain daily active addresses. Even if that were one address per user (which it isn\u2019t), that\u2019s not a great success after such a long time.\n\nCoinbase, on the other hand, is exponentially larger because they excel at customer acquisition. We need blockchains that have a real acquisition strategy to bring people on-chain, and we can deliver that. Our combined experience in D2C marketing and customer acquisition will be a game-changer for Glue, ensuring we don\u2019t just build a great product, but also get it into the hands of millions of users.",

            "So quite a low supply to start with and then high inflation/token unlocks? It helps with the initial price but good luck after that, that\u2019s some heavy dilution",
            "Kind of, but not really. The vast majority of the supply will be controlled by the on-chain treasury that requires full votes to be distributed (check out the governance section of the white paper for details). So technically governance could just burn them although that\u2019d be very short sighted.\u00a0\nInflation rate (also controlled by governance after the initial setting) will be relatively low after an initial boost for early adopters.\u00a0\n\nSo there are no major \u201cdefault unlocks\u201d of the treasury tokens coming that are not approved by a full governance vote. Our idea is that we have a lot of cool growth plans which will need funding. For example I think there will be some really interesting acquisition opportunities of traditional companies to get adoption. But it will all be based on voting. So yes, it\u2019s low float, high FDV, but it\u2019s not an automatic unlock to made up things like \u201ccommunity\u201d and \u201cpartners\u201d.\u00a0",

If this comes up for a vote it will likely include a topic limit of 2 in the top 50, so the sub wouldn't be overran with Memes.

            "Dell computers suck not to mention how they stick it to you with service fees and technical support imported from overseas.  Worst technical services that one can not understand them when they speak to you .",

            "tldr; Michael Dell, CEO of Dell Technologies, sparked interest in the crypto community by tweeting about the value of scarcity and engaging with a comment about Bitcoin being digital scarcity. He further intrigued followers by sharing a meme of the Cookie Monster eating Bitcoin, leading to speculation about his interest in cryptocurrency. While this interaction suggests a playful interest in Bitcoin, there's no indication that Dell Technologies is making a move towards cryptocurrency investment. The post highlights the balance between the appetite for acquiring Bitcoin and the importance of moderation and self-control.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

How have those gone downhill?\n\nAFAIK, all PC brands have been improving in their > $1K laptops (except for Apple, which keeps on removing ports and increasing prices)",
            "Had so many Dell Latitudes with busted TPM and mobo, their OEM drives are also absolute garbage.  These are all their enterprise line. The OEM SSDs have the worst performance and don\u2019t even get me started on their docking stations.  Dell docking stations are literally garbage, had so many where the monitors would flicker or the damn nic would go in/out/loose connectivity.",

            "I had bad experiences with XPS 13 and 15. \n\nBoth had light bleeding issues right off the manufacturerso had to sent them in.\n\nThe docking stations are garbage. No tlp out of the box. Overall pretty crappy battery life, terrible keyboards.\n\nAnd the xps15 battery was blown after 2 years and fked up the track pad which again was pretty mediocre compared to a ThinkPads or MacBook Pros\n\nI'm just done with Dell for good",
            "xps is overrated. any windows notebooks worth more than $800 is garbage. and if you use linux you dont need expensive laptop in the first place",
            "Interesting. I've supported Latitude and Precisions in 3 different companies, and we've never had these issues. 2 decades ago, there were capacitor issues. We haven't had hard disk issues for a decade since switching to SSDs. About 1 broken SSD per 3 years per 200 laptops. About 3 broken Mobos per 3 years per 200 laptops. They've been so reliable that we stopped buying extended warranties on them. Even normal warranty is no longer worth the cost.\n\nBatteries depends on the department. Sales department always eats up batteries because they travel and leave their laptops under the sun, but the rest of the company has no issues with them.\n\nThe old-style docking stations where the laptop sat on top of them were flimsy, but we haven't seen issues with the new Thunderbolt ones.\n\nUnless you're only talking about monitor issues with the docks. In that case, we've always seen them with every type of dock we've tried: Dell, Lenovo, and 3rd-party.",

            "A fully decked out XPS is nice. Dell diluted their XPS series a bit, and I've been a little disappointed by the cheaper end.\n\n> customer support/warranty is pretty good\n\nI've heard that their customer-side customer support is trash, but luckily I've never deal with them. I've worked with Dell Pro Support for over a decade (from back when it was \"Gold Pro Support\"), and Pro Support is excellent. It used to be amazing with next-day onsite support, but it's gotten really expensive. And now with Latitude/Precision laptops lasting 5+ years average, it's cheaper just to replace them whenever they break than pay for 5 years of extended Pro Support.",
            "I collect rare self published comic books, often with print runs well under 50 copies. None of them are ever worth anything unless the author eventually gets famous.

You can\u2019t because I can give you a number of examples of rare things that are not valuable because there is no demand. You need demand for value.",

I've had so many issues trying to get triple 1080p or dual 1080p + one 4K working on their docks. They say they support those setups, but I find that monitors often glitch and disconnect randomly.\n\nThis issue happens with non-Dell docks too. I find multi-monitor setups to be as flaky as printer drivers. It's technology that's been around for years and should work effortlessly, but never does.",
