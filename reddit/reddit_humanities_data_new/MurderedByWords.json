I was a pretty active mod here for awhile, and stepped back once the sub was in good hands. It's been great watching the sub get huge, I still remember hitting the 1mil mark and being super excited about it.\n\nWhile I haven't really been as visible here lately, I've always kept an eye on the place and it's been fun watching it grow. Today I'm formally turning my mod keys in, and I guess I just wanted to say goodbye to the first Reddit community I was ever in charge of. Y'all are great.\n\nRemember, [Be excellent to each other. And party on, dudes.](https://youtu.be/rph_1DODXDU)",

We built the customer base and kept them coming back. The rent we paid for the building was the user base we attracted, and the customers were free to show up by whatever method they liked.

We've noticed that this sub does not suffer from lack of quality content without the political posts, and provides a safe haven from people, both in the US and overseas, who want a slight break from the incessant shitshow that is the US political system. \n\nMembers and subscribers of r/MurderedByWords - You have spoken, and we have listened. \n\nOver the past year we've been deluged with messages, direct chats and modmails asking us to please do something about the incessant political posts on this sub. We have been called \"a less funny version of r/politicalhumor\", which is pretty damn insulting. \n\nHowever, when we tried to have a temporary ban on all political content, the subreddit suffered - Less posts were submitted, which led to less comments and less interaction. We need to remember that the final purpose of this sub is to entertain our subscribers, visitors and lurkers, provide you the content you are looking for. \n\nFast forward to today - It's 2 months before the US Presidential, Congressional and Senatorial Elections, the political posts are getting worse than ever, and with them the requests to do something about it. To that end, the moderation team has discussed this, and beginning from Sept 3, we will be imposing a temporary ban on all things related to the US Elections until after Elections Day (Nov 3). \n\nWhat does this mean? Posts meeting any of these criteria will be removed immediately, and the user will receive a temporary ban:\n\n* If any of the people in the post is in public office, is running for public office, or holds a position in the current administration or the campaign staff \n* If the subject of the post is in public office or running for public office, or holds a position in the current administration or the campaign staff\n* If any of the people in the post or the subject of the post is anyhow related to the Trump or Biden family or to someone who holds a position in the current administration or the campaign staff\n\nExamples of posts which are now prohibited include:\n\n* Orange Man Bad\n* Jeff Tiedrich (who really needs to get a fucking life)\n* Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweets\n* Lincoln Project\n* The Conway family\n*  Hunter Biden posts\n\nPlease note that this is **NOT YET** a full ban on all political subjects or a full ban on all political content going beyond the elections. We will be keeping very close attention during the upcoming two months to see how the subreddit and our members react to this ban. If we see that it is successful, we may choose to extend it. We also would appreciate your comments on this post to let us know your thoughts on the subject.",

            "The entire premise of Murdered By Words is a stinging counterpoint by one individual to an ignorant, egotistical, self-righteous, and/or hypocritical statement made by another individual.   \n\n\nA quick scan of this sub demonstrates that an outsized number of ignorant , egotistical, self-righteous, and/or hypocritical statements come from the right side of the aisle, and the counterpoint \"murders\" come from the left. Trump, his cronies, and his progeny open themselves up to rhetorical homicide on a daily basis. If the right wing followers of this sub don't like how often somebody accurately calls this administration (and related syndicate) on their nonsense, they are more than welcome to downvote, hide the post, make a counter-counterpoint, block the redditor who shared the murder in question, and/or locate an example of a linguistic assassination that goes in the other direction. (If they can find one that doesn't contain hate speech.) They can even unfollow the sub. There are already processes by which they can see fewer \"political\" posts.  \n\n\nInstead, they chose to go the \"snow crystal\" route and complain to you that \"There's too much politics!\" There isn't too much politics. There's too much politics that doesn't fit their worldview for which they can offer no obverse. So they want you to unbalance things for them, and you are obliging them. And in obliging them, you are opening yourself to be further constrained by them. Once Trump and the rest of his swamp are off the table, they're going to complain to you that too many people are going after Charlie Kirk or people making \"All Lives Matter\" tweets. Soon they'll be asking you to ban posts that burn ignorant statements from law enforcement. They will dictate to you the content of this sub rather than the other way around. You said you've been deluged by complaints. Can you quantify that? A thousand complaints? Ten thousand? One hundred thousand? There are **two million members** of this sub. How many \"squeaky wheels\" are making you steer this sub away from a course that I would hazard to guess a vast majority of the members are and have been perfectly content with?   \n\n\nIf being called \"a less funny version of [r/politicalhumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/politicalhumor/)\" is enough to get under your skin, maybe you aren't cut out to moderate a sub that specializes in well-crafted insults.

This sub original premise is [*lengthy and detailed* rebuttals](https://old.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/bazdpy/this_is_the_comment_that_inspired_this_sub_this/) which essentially \"murder\" the opponent's argument, regardless how ignorant or whatever the original point was. An intellectual verbal K.O, so to say. Not low-hanging Twitter burns and bickering. Politics high-jacked this sub and turned it into orange man bad circlejerk, and now you are complaining that mods are trying to rein the sub back to its origin?\n\nYour \"going after\" attitude is the prime example of what's wrong with the sub and why politics ban was needed. You value pushing your agenda against the evil orange man above all else, expecting everyone to provide you a platform for it for the greater good or something.\n\nMake no mistake, Trump is an incompetent idiot at best, he sucks. But so does the constant whining about him, especially in unrelated subs and especially for non-americans. You remember there's a world outside of America, right? And as soon someone points it out, you deflect to \"well it just doesn't fit your worldview\". No, Trump being an idiot fits my worldview perfectly. But not in every damn sub 24/7. \n\nYes, there's too much politics, and no, it has nothing to do with it fitting anyone's worldview. Let's take a look at some of the top posts. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/iullqa/science_denier_carefully_and_methodically/) is a perfect example of a murder. That's what the sub is about. You know what it wasn't meant to be about, until you lot came along and high-jacked it? [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/hj3y39/im_gonna_take_the_surgeons_side_on_this_one/) kind of shit. It's not a murder. It's barely even a good comeback, just a low effort \"no you\". [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/ecr60f/murdered_with_one_word_almost_3_years_later/) is not a murder. Funny, but not a murder.

As obvious from examples, there's lots of shitty non-murder non-political posts that are upvoted simply because people agree/think they're funny, not because they fit the sub. But politics sure drove nail in the coffin of this sub's quality spearheading the decline. While it'd be preferred if mods just banned Twitter screenshots all-together (since 120 character limit goes against whole point of the sub - detailed and lengthy rebuttals) and short comebacks/burns, banning politics covers a big chunk of problematic content and helps getting rid of users who value political agenda above all else. \n\n\n> They can even unfollow the sub.\n\nMaybe you should follow your own advice and find a proper forum to drive your political agenda. Many are here just for laughs and couldn't care less about Trump and his incompetence, different subs exist for a reason, you know.\n\n---\n\nEdit: I love how some replies accuse me of being a Trump supporter and other things just because I don't think political slapfights fit the sub. You're just further proving my point.\n\n---\n\nEdit 2: The original comment above got so mad that they blocked me, which means I can't reply to any comments below either thanks to the Reddit's stupid system.",

Like, you care more about the opinions of your subscribers who care enough to comment rather than those who just vote?\n\nThe only reason I bring it up is because I think comments on reddit, across the board, are skewed heavily negative toward the content of the post. Reddit culture dictates that if you like a piece of content, you upvote it. Posting a comment like \"I liked this\" or \"lol\" will get you heavily downvoted and people will tell you to just upvote the content. But if you have something negative to say about the content, going to the comments is the reddit cultural norm and is more acceptable. It seems like a definite source of bias to base decisions on comment sentiment by itself.",

He can and will change with time. Thus, if his 'self' changes, suddenly humans change as we are made in his image. \n\nThe fact that religions try to be streamlined and unyielding is wild. Gods will can change on a dime because by all accounts, he's a 'living' being. You change. I change. He by all accounts, can change and scriptures prove it. The big issue is the human element on interpreting that 'change' because its not like he's gonna come down and say \"this is who I am now humans, deal with it! It's not a phase!!! It's my way of life!\" \n\nIf you look further back, God as actually changed many times. It wasn't God, who is now jehova (to Christians), who was yahweh(hebrews), who was ba'al(canntines), who was... the lost goes on... but they are all the same figure, depending on which scripture you use. And their 'personality' is wildly different. Fun fact; the ancient Hebrews tried to say baal was actually the devil and a completely different god to yahweh. Because they weren't fans of the canannites. Then the two cultures merged and baals name got dropped all together due to the negative stigma the ancient Hebrews used baal for. Remember the plagues in Egypt? Yeah, that wasn't yahweh, that was baal. They invoked baal because they felt yahweh would just nuke everything indiscriminately. As yahweh is known to do. Remember, yahweh made them wonder the desert for 50 years for not trusting him enough. You really want that god smiting your oppressors? He'll smite them so hard, it'll include you and you better be fucking grateful. Or he might just smite you harder than the oppressors!",

And when you can\u2019t prove something in any way, you must doubt it. \n\nDipshit, you must learn about it and test it. The most science thing to exist? The most science thing to do is actually read comparative religions, study breakthroughs in physics, consider the possibility of God, create hypothesis and try and test everything, rather than shitting on people and declaring them to believe in something that is wrong or false. Fucking fake ass evangelical \"scientists\".\n\nFace it, you have adopted a religion. Your faith has stopped your thinking mind. Be a dear and simply respect the faith of others.\n\nEdit 2: And to \n\n>[\u2013]Fun-Outlandishness35 16 points 10 hours ago* \nPsssttt\u2026 god\u2019s not real.

What about men, they don't carry children or give birth, can they never achieve their greatest purpose? \n\nWhat if someone invents immortality; does this become the greatest purpose because reproduction will no longer be necessary? \n\nOr do we think that everything is finite and binary in a universe that has proven that anything is possible?",

None of this is true. \n\nWhether or not having the ability to give life is valuable depends on the person who has the ability and what they want to do with it. \n\nJust because someone else might think it's valuable (or might say it's valuable *for them* when they are not the one with the capability or the one whose capability is being considered) doesn't give them the right to have control over another or shame them for what they would do with or to their own ability. \n\n(For context TheTransformedWife is an anti-abortion, pro-submissive-christian-wife and Trad gender roles *whether you want to or not*, kind of person. And anti-queer too cuz why not apparently.

And in my life, only what I value for me has any value. So if there's something I have that I say is worth nothing, then it is worth nothing, as it's not like I'm donating it or something. Everyone else should have the right to do the same, shame free. And unlike what that grifter would have ppl think, no one is any less for thinking it's an absolutely worthless or useless thing for them to have/have to do - as they would be correct. \n\nBut feel free to keep thinking it is the most valuablefor everyone, if you want. It's not and that fact won't change. \n\nFor your sake, I hope you're not one of those dumbasses that thinks abortion is murder like the idiot you're defending above does, because I celebrate that that can happen free out-of-pocket and fully confidential where I am, everyday.",
