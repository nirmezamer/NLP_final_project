Of course not as much the more worn and worse condition it\u2019s in. Same thing with rare baseball cards if you like to take them out the packaging and handle them with your oily fingers.\u00a0\n\nBut none of that changes the fact that wearing counterfeit imitations is unfair to those who paid to wear the real thing. The main reason counterfeit apologists are hated is because they are aware of this and they are incapable of responding to this criticism without saying something dishonest, disrespectful, and/or otherwise unreasonable about the hobby and/or those who value authenticity.\u00a0",

            "How is this any different than replica art, or other replica fashion pieces? And in those circles, it\u2019s completely accepted. \n\nIf I\u2019m going to wear reps, I\u2019m going to do it because I like the style, model, cw, story, etc of the shoe. It\u2019s because I align with the vision of the shoe/brand. \n\nIf you buy expensive legit sneakers, that\u2019s completely cool, but if you then talk about how much you spent on them, or the fact that you got the authentic version more than the actual shoe, you seem to be just as much a loser as the asshole who bought rep TS J1 and is flexing them.",

            "Also.... if fashion reps are \"far from completely accepted.\"   Then why does this subreddit have 4 million members, while r/fashionreps has 1.6 million. I'd say that's pretty well accepted.  Maybe not 100% completely.  But definitely more than \"far from.\"",
            "Wouldn't be a problem if companies did one or both of two things... \n\n1) Make enough of the item for most of the interested consumers to be able to acquire them.\n\n2) Sell them at a reasonable price.\n\n$1000 shoes shouldn't exist unless they of some obscure and helpful features. I can't even think of what... maybe guaranteed to last forever, self clean and cushion that never fails? Motorized heelys?\n\nIf you value your authentics more, then buy authentics. Many can't afford shoes that because there's not enough supply to obtain, $150 retails are resold for $400+.  That's absurd and should be as illegal as buying reps. Scalping shoes is as bad as scalping tickets. I'll pay the $150 retail if I like them and they're available. But if I can get a rep for $100, and it's is almost identical in look, function and durability, then I'm okay with that vs. The $400+ (2-3 times) cost of resellers prices."

The soles are also stitched to the upper and can be replaced several times. With most Jordans, once the sole starts coming apart, you're kinda fucked. People do sole swaps, sure, but that's still just gluing them on and requires sacrificing a whole donor pair."
