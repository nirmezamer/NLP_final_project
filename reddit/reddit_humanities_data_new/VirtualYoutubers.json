I still watch it sometimes, his personality is more or less the same. It's just that in his other persona, he mostly does collabs with other people (a quite big group), I don't know much about them yet to care, and I don't bother to learn about them, so I don't enjoy it as much.

She's also doing like 4x better than her previous peak in terms of subs, the new company is providing a lot more support, most of the older fans followed her over, and she's even managed to capture a few big-name illustrators as fans so she's really thriving now, and I'm happy to see it.",

It probably doesn't help that a lot of the ones I followed are not very active as indies anyways. If they only stream once a month you just kind of...move on.\n\n  \nThere's also some people like Henya and Matara who changed their active hours. And it's a smart business move, there's a reason why there are ten million streamers active during evening NA times. But the old timeslot was definitely one of the reasons why I was watching them in the first place, and now they have endless competition, so only being kinda interested in them basically means I will never tune in because there is always a competing stream to watch instead.",

            "I won't touch on their previous identities or even name which ones, but 2 of my 3 main oshis right now are reincarnations of older oshis I had that graduated.\n\nThere were many things both lost in gained in both reincarnations. \n\nOne was a reincarnation from indie to corp and into a very specific role within that corp too. While they are generally really lax in what they let her do despite being a pretty major corp (not major within VTubing though) it's still very noticeable to me the ways she's changed through becoming a part of this corporation. I really appreciate all the things she's become able to do with all the extra support, and she seems really happy with where she is so I'm very happy for her, but there are still always moments where I feel a bit of a sense of loss of what she used to be like. Regardless I don't see myself stopping watching her or supporting her.\n\nThe other actually went from indie to indie for a myriad of reasons I don't want to delve into in respect of her privacy but the gist of the reasoning behind her reincarnation is there was a lot of baggage with regards to her image with her previous identity and she wasn't able to become the VTuber she had desired to. So she took a fresh start and it's very clear and easy to see the efforts she's taken in order to be more like the VTuber she's always aspired to be. She also seems to be very happy and I fully support her in her endeavors but I do find it a little sad both that she was that unhappy with how her previous life had ended up when I loved her that much, and also with her new image it also means she'll be doing a little bit less of some content that I really liked before and more of my least favourite type of content (but her main content is still my favourite type of content so I'm definitely not going anywhere at all).",

I dunno, maybe I place too high an emphasis on community, but that's just my own personal feelings.\n\nHoloAdvent PL talk: >!To be 100% frank, as much as I love Shiori herself and am happy for her success, I do miss the unique individual connection she used to have with her smaller community as Natsumi Moe. I'm grateful that she still keeps in touch, but the shift in community culture, her stream time slot change, and the improbability I'll ever get to see the amazing chemistry she had with her OG EN VTuber friends (who I mainly watch besides her) again do put a damper on my enjoyment.!<\n\nEdit: Words",
            "It is honestly a weird expectation to think that their new corpo/indie self would be the same as their old corpo/indie self. I mean obviously the restrictions for being in a (especially big)company will change how a streamer operates versus how they do by themself. As others have said here, many former corpos returning to the indie scene haven't really bothered taking advantage of their new found creative freedom. Staying in their lane a little too much. Doing to much of the same with little variety. Whereas oddly enough, being forced to work with restrictions has made for better streamers for those in a company. Clearly more creative in what types of streams they do. Seems contradictory at first but it actually makes sense.",

            "They need to factor in the spending power and the average disposable income of each region. There is no point in expanding to a region just for the namesake of going 'global' if that region has no spending power.\n\nHere's an interesting sheet about the [World Disposable Income Per Capita By Region](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/data/pdf/A_A18_r_230822.081459.pdf). I'll write out the 2025 predicted data for individual regions those that don't want to open the link:\n\nRegion: | Est Avg Disposable Income 2025\n-- | --\nUnited States | $49,193\nCanada | $28,073\nMexico | $15,608\nBrazil | $11,582\nOther Americas | $3,709\nWestern Europe | $24,232\nRussia | $16,287\nEastern Europe and Eurasia | $9,839\nJapan | $24,037\nSouth Korea | $22,960\nAustralia and New Zealand | $32,360\nChina | $12,236\nIndia | $6,308\nOther Asia Pacific | $6,319\nAfrica | $1,703\nMiddle East | $5,290\n\nBasically from this chart, you can see why an entertainment company like Cover would not care about getting into Africa whatsoever. The entire continent has extremely low disposable income per person. Similar case with South America, although we do have Brazil and a somewhat standout spender.\n\nYou can see why NA is so appealing for companies to expand into. With the US alone, for the price of dealing with a single country, you get a population of 330m+ people with more than double the disposable income of Western EU's population of roughly 300m people. And they don't have to deal with the red tape and differing regulations of a ton of different countries. Throw in Canada (40m population) and you've got an extremely sweet NA deal.\n\nAU's got very strong spending power per person as well, they're just held back by population number (about 30m for AU + NZ).\n\nChina's spending power looks relatively lowish, but they have an insane population number to multiply that with (1.43 billion) which is why they're so appealing to expand into.\n\nOf course there's other factors to consider, like the conversion rate of getting people to spend on digital goods rather than traditional merch, how much VTubers can actually penetrate the market or go mainstream, etc. But yeah, this should give you a rough overview of which regions are appealing for Cover to expand into, and which regions just aren't worth trying.",

It's the end of a persona that the vtuber and their fanbase have probably become pretty attached to. It can also be the end of them publicly affiliating with certain people (e.g. others in their corp if they're graduating from that corp, or some of their old indie friends if they're an indie moving to a corp) and can signal a change in content or in general vibes. It also means a change in community, since only the more hardcore members of their audience are likely to look for their reincarnation and more casual fans will move on and maybe become part of the community again if they find their new persona by chance. \n\nThere are certainly graduations where the person decides they just don't want to be a vtuber or online creator in general anymore and rides off into the night never to be seen again.

            ">All EU streamer should be resident in EU.\n\nIts not about the actual location, its about timezone-compability.\n\nAssuming you have School, Uni, or a non work-from-home Job, which I assume are most people, the earliest you'll really be able to watch streams at properly is 4 or 5 PM, 6 PM more realistically. But for a streamer living in Japan, that would mean **starting** **at Midnight or 1 Am**, and the basically streaming through the entire Night. Sure, that *can* happen, but just statistically speaking its much more *unlikely*.\n\nIs that that hard to understand?",
            "Given how little information we've actually gotten I think people are trying to figure out what we're actually going to get, and based on vague piecemeal info so far we've gone from \"this is holoEU\" to \"ok only 2 of them are actually in Europe and judging by their debut times they might still be focused on PST primarily\" which is a bit frustrating if you're hoping for more streams in an underserved timezone. Ultimately you're still acting weirdly angry over people saying they want to be able to watch more hololive streams live.",
            "Some EU fans... some. Don't go painting all of us with the same brush.\n\nAm I remembering this wrong but some of the other EN fans were whining about the same things back in the day when they figured out that not all of Holo EN live in NA permanently if at all?\n\nI remember that either with Niji EN or Holo EN some folks where whining along the lines of \"it's wrong for people who should've applied for JP to take a place from potential EN talents.\" I feel like I've seen this same kind of crap happen with both companies by now to some extent... I wonder how much there is overlap in the fanbases and if it's the same people whining again about the same thing. Not that I really care... I think both companies simply just try to hire the best talent they can within the possibilities they're given.",
            ">All EU streamer should be resident in EU.\n\nYes, people expect EU streamers to live in Europe and stream at European times. This isn't a particular weird request.\n\n>A EN Gen debut should put in the best time slot of EU ignoring the main EN audience\n\nWho's asking for the best time slot? People are asking for a timeslot that isn't in the middle of the night.\n\n>They should change the schedulers of hundreds of employees to accommodate the EU audience.\n\nHow much work do you think goes into actually debuting? They don't need anything more than a handful of employees being on standby. Which would be no problem if they hired outside of Japan.",

            "Kobo blew up the market by grabbing normies, but Holo moved into ID because they already had a local market for Vtubers because of their love of Japanese media as well as Nijisanji having a relatively successful branch there that they inexplicably abandoned.",
            "And yet ID got 2 gens before \u201ccapturing the market\u201d as you put it. So why are Americans going around saying we have to front up with numbers equivalent to them to justify having any Hololive members stream in a CEST friendly time other than Kiara?

            "Hey, I'm a Kenzoku and never get to catch her live anymore after she went back to stream times that work better for her and her now mostly Japanese audience.\n\nIt'd be **nice** to see her live. And I do get to see the Holos who work on West Coast times live more often than that, but hey. I'm hoping the new Gen works out for EU fans, but their struggles aren't exactly new to Holo fans outside of JP.",

Unless they also burn-out like Myth does, Promise is doing amazing on the streaming side hence they're the targets of those 4chan schizos with the bots by using Advent against them",

            "That sounds logical in hindsight. But if they hadn't thought to make an exception for it before, then it was technically still forbidden.\n\nI recall Bae saying she came up with the plan for the Tempus watchalongs, and got them approved through management. My guess is when they saw how positive the response was to that, they decided to allow the exception to the overlap rules for watchalongs in a more general sense.",
            "Wait you're right, it was Miko, I might have conflated the Peko fangirling interactions in my head",
            "Yes, I agree. She later even [denied having one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD17H90cgA). I'll keep digging for clips for a while to see if she mentioned anything else on the matter, if you find anything please tell me!",

            "Youtube only does that for the CCV\n\nWhen the views are tallied up for the VOD, it will include people watching on a different tab. It will also include people using third party embedded videos too (which is how Discord accidentally racked up over a billion views during April Fools)",
            "Tbh I think overall viewership probably matters more than a number on YouTube anyway. The latter may help you do *x*% better in the algorithm, but the point of doing well in the algorithm is to get more eyes on you. So doing it via watchalong is just cutting out the algo middleman.",
            ">!I understand that. My point is that Yunii doesn't have a work identity. It looks like she retired \"Yuniiho\" for good and will just be Raora for now, but yeah we'll have to wait and see.!<",

            "I'm going to horribly butcher the phrase but I've heard it said that \"limitations are the wellspring of creativity.\"\n\nThe gist being that sometimes operating with more severe restrictions leads to greater innovation than having the freedom to do whatever you want. Obviously this really only shines with people who have the mindset to capitalize on the opportunities they have and the patience to polish their skills in preparation of those moments.",
            "Exactly this. After four gens (and three gens of Holostars) where Kiara has remained the sole EU representation, its not rocket science to understand why EU viewers are desperate for streamers they can actually watch. \n\n\"I'm British but I live in San Francisco and will be streaming at 3am your time just like all the others\" really doesn't move the needle any or change the situation from what it is now.",
            ">\"it's wrong for people who should've applied for JP to take a place from potential EN talents.\"\n\nyea, kotoka and meloco (and back in the day shu) from nijien and fwmc from holoen all have persistent dedicated haters who use this reasoning",
            ">\u00a0Who's asking for the best time slot? People are asking for a timeslot that isn't in the middle of the night.\n\n\nYeah, I mean, they pretty much picked one of the objectively worst timeslots possible for the debuts if they want to appeal to EU fans. A relay starting at 4 or 5 AM is too late for most night owls but too early for most early risers.\n\n\nAnd we've defenitely had better timeslots in the past, Council debuted at a much more reasonable time for Europeans even though two of its members were Australian.",
            "Yagoo mentioned this in the early interview. On top of other reasons, they saw the statistics that a lot of views from their streams and clips came a lot from ID\n\nSo basically ID didn't have to prove themselves because the audience there already proven that they consumed a lot of content even though it was all in Japanese at that time. I think Yagoo also mentioned seeing hololive cosplays in unrelated anime expos in very early days. So it showed somehow hololive got popular organically in ID without Cover even trying to do anything there. \n\nBeing in the same-ish timezones as JP and it being much cheaper to operate in is definitely a factor too.\nThat's why they took the step. Its little risk for them.",
            "HoloID exists because NijiID existed, Cover was just copying what Nijisanji was doing back in the day. This idea is reinforced by the official HoloKR and HoloIN twitter accounts that were created but nothing ever came of them.\n\nAs for Dokomi, they pissed Cover off one too many times by messing up their concerts and meet&greets that they won\u2019t even bother with them anymore.",
            "ID is a traditional test market for Japanese corps looking to expanding overseas.",
            "Idol doesn't count?",

            "It's not IRyS own section (I also thought that at first), Promise replaced Council as a gen.",
            "wait that's actually crazy. I 100% thought cover pushed for tempus watchalong",
            "It's not Miko. It's Pekora, she always evaded the oshi question, but people assumed Miko because they're close and Koyo had a Miko wallpaper, but she decided to reveal it last year so she could express how much Pekora gave her confidence to not give up on her dreams.\n\nShe didn't say before because she didn't want anyone to bother Pekora over it, so she first told her directly, revealed it on her last anniversary live and then went over it [when she did the Pekora sololive watchalong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd-lU9gcJdU). Sorry for the long answer. lol",
            "I didn't want to mention names because it's kinda off-topic but to heck with it,  yeah I know, first one to make that a meme is because of Idubbbz wearing it then later having endless out of touch dramas with his partner over the creator clash charity money being wasted to host parties and pay content creators and their private life being shown to the world with some of the info that can put people to shame \n\nNick Rekieta is worse with scam on vic mignogna coming to light, swinging relationship, embarrassing kinky shit like the \"ball-do\" (some kind of sex toy that crushes your balls) which he had been sponsored for it multiple times as well, drug abuse, potentially child abuse worse than neglect (latest findings say one of their child was positive of cocaine) etc\n\nHaven't even mentioned the creator of the medallion Chris-chan and the deeper rabbit hole it is to even expound upon",
            "Do you mean they first debut oversea in which they don't have much idea of what result would be??? It is called streamlining, they collected the data from the other debuts and developed what they think is the best option for said process.\n\n COVER has reached what they think is the best possible time slot for EN Gens Debuts and they will probably will not change it.",
            "Yea. I don't think it's necessarily a bad idea. I like them trying things out as I don't think the core audience will be impacted either way. Only argument would be they might not get the best algorithm hit to attract new people but that's a black box of \"who knows\" anyways... Based on how trending works, the algorithm might use secondary sources and other platforms anyways.",
            "Cover doesn't restrict what other work you do, unlike Anycolor. They only want you to keep an arm's-length relationship between the other work and your corporate identity.",
            "Yeah, usually the freedom to do whatever for streamers leads to react content or being involved in drama.",
            "meloco one is flaring up again because she's in Niji GTA, one of the few, maybe the only NijiEN consistently joining it because of their RP rules discouraging a lot of EOP NijiENs, the other ENs that can speak Japanese are busy or out of commission so she's kinda standing out and getting hate from different fronts",
            "> As for Dokomi, they pissed Cover off one too many times by messing up their concerts and meet&greets that they won\u2019t even bother with them anymore.\n\nWhat exactly happened? I remember watching their HoloEN panels back in 2021 and don't remember anything bad.",
            "I didn\u2019t mention DoKomi in relation to Cover, I was pointing out that vtubers in Europe, not just Hololive ones, have had a presence in the anime community for years.",
            "And most of the ones I follow are JP or ID, so they never match me.   More power to EU fans, but we can't say if they're locked out just because the debut times aren't in EU timezones yet. Ina, as pointed out earlier, streamed at a time that was EU friendly, but she's not focusing on the EU audience and isn't based there. Vesper had EU friendly times, but they weren't his main market either.\n\nHell, even with the EN I do follow, most of them stream while I'm working so I have to catch the VOD anyways.\n\nTowa-sama, after the week's suspension, streamed at NA friendly times. That's when a bunch of Kenzoku got to see her and follow her. We can't say if Justice will be streaming at their debut times forever, or if they'll go to EU friendly times after their debuts. Anyone who's complaining about their debut times catering to NA needs to chill out.",
            "So I was correct! Yeah, the hype and giddiness oozing from her for Pekora was different for Miko, like, it couldn't just be her being reserved to Miko if she was her oshi but then go gush about Pekora",
            "Wait what scam? You mean how he convinced Vic to waste money on a lawyer who didnt specialize in defamation who also had ties to his own estate, while he gassed everyone up into thinking it was an easy win, then Vic lost and we never heard about it again? Or was something even worse happening?",
            ">Do you mean they first debut oversea in which they don't have much idea of what result would be??? \n\nIronically the GMT debut times for the second EN gen were arguably even better aligned with EU prime time:\n\nSana: 6 PM\n\nFauna: 7:30 PM\n\nKronii: 9 PM\n\nMumei: 10:30 PM\n\nBae: midnight\n\nGoing from this to having talents to do one of the arguably most important and certainly most stressful streams of their career at 4 AM to an audience that presumably won't even be able to watch the majority of their \"normal\" streams anyway seems questionable but in the end there's nothing we can do about it I guess",
            "For the concerts, they put the concerts right on opening doors so a ton of people who wanted to go to the concert couldn\u2019t because they were stuck in line to enter the venue.\n\nFor meet and greets, they forgot to announce the winners of the raffles through email so no one knew who won until when m&g should\u2019ve started. KFP ended up helping a lot with getting people aware of where to go after emails were eventually sent.",
            "Yeah, Koyo and Miko have a sibling relationship and she respects Miko a lot as well, but it's a bit different. Funnily enough there were some hints over the years like Marine revealing on stream that Koyori's house is full of Peko goods or how loyal Koyori was to Pekora in Rust while still trying to always to respect her space. lol",
            "That indeed, also because said lawyer Ty Beard supposedly not only did not specialize in defamation, he sucked HARD at it and basically lost every hearing be it due to multiple errors in paperworks submitted, alleged tardiness, and offense full of holes and basically have to pay his opponents for losing so badly and appealing\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2ennmcc918d1.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef91a14d4bf1b7943e764669270d14b5d0e2f465\n\n[https://x.com/GreatCheshire/status/1753528907930677573?t=Odk4ClcOV6z4JTYbF3Sv8Q&s=19](https://x.com/GreatCheshire/status/1753528907930677573?t=Odk4ClcOV6z4JTYbF3Sv8Q&s=19)\n\n>lawyer who didnt specialize in defamation who also had ties to his own estate\n\nAlso it goes deeper because from the piranha of lawyers chiming in the issue leaking stuff about Nick, Ty Beard was not only that, he was also a family friend of his grandparents/parents who were millionaires, yes Nick is a Trust Fund baby and Ty Beard was helping him back then to start up his business firm, people speculate that, him giving the gig to Ty Beard is a pat on the back move not because he's qualified for the job obviously",
            "Yep, as an EU fan I remember the total disappointment when the girls shared their shedules. They'd pretty much never stream at that time slot again. After that, I don't expect anything but I'd love to be wrong."

Kustard, and Alicja Da Lontano. Bonnie also  speaks conversational Japanese, and can understand a little French.\n\nBonnie is a Golden Retriever Airship Engineer with a Steampunk style,  complete with goggles, leather gloves, sturdy boots, large overalls and  various tools hanging from a belt. She also has short, orange hair with  white tips and a paw-print marking on one of her ears. \n\nBonnie loves to chat and free-talk with her viewers and collaborate  with other VTubers. She also enjoys doing Karaoke streams, cozy games  and  and playing old point-and-click adventure games from the 90's.  Bonnie is also a hobbyist illustrator and sometimes does art streams and  posts her work on twitter. She likes to draw herself or fan-art of  other VTubers. Bonnie's favourite streams are ones where she can push  the boundaries and be innovative and creative with assets and viewer  interactions.\n\nOn 17th April 2024, Bonnie was the first member of globie to reach  over 10,000 subscribers on Youtube, 2 days before her debut on the 19th.  She then reached 20,000 subscribers on 7th June 2024. Her debut stream  consisted of a short skit inspired by a cruise ship safety briefing  video, and a minigame in which chat had to use various tools to \"fix\"  the pipes and clear the room of steam, revealing her model. \n\n# Trivia\n\n* Bonnie is often teased on twitter for being \"old\" and some of her  most viral tweets have involved memes from the community joking about  \"refiring a dying star\". One of these memes even being featured in a  \"Know Your Meme\" entry. Her viewers also coined the terms \"Pupmaxxing\"  and \"Litterpilled\" in reference to her.\n* Bonnie revealed on her debut that she is a Golden Retriever and 4  in dog years, making her age approximately 28-32 years old in human  years. \n* Due to Bonnie's first ASMR stream being derailed by many  high-value donations from viewers, it is now a running joke in the  community that every Friday stream is called \"Findom Fridays\".\n* It's a common misconception in her lore that Bonnie is the  Captain of the airship, however she is actually just the Engineer and  often refers to a mysterious Captain figure who flies the ship. One of  her goals at debut was to be promoted to Captain.\n* Bonnie has stated that one of her biggest passions is travelling the world and has so far visited over 22 different countries.\n* When Bonnie began streaming, she had a small collection of 4 or 5  Hatsune Miku figurines. However, due to a large number of donations  from her viewers via Throne, she now has over 20 different figures.\n* Bonnie loves space and sci-fi movies like Interstellar,  Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy and Gravity, but her favourite movie of  all time is The Martian.\n* Bonnie's catchphrase at the start of her streams is \"BALLS OUT  FOR BONNIE! \ud83e\udd4e\", a reference to her first tweet and to how dogs are  commonly associated with tennis balls.\n\nLinks\n\n* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@BonnieBarkswell) \n* [Twitter](https://x.com/BonnieBarkswell) \n* [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@bonnie.barkswell) \n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bonniebarkswell/) \n* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bonnie_Barkswell/) \n* [Throne](https://throne.com/bonniebarkswell) \n* [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/bonnie_barkswell)\n* [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/bonniebarkswell/) \n* [Globie website](https://globie.net/) \n* [Globie twitter](https://x.com/globiesocial) \n* [Globie Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/globie_hub/) \n* [Globie Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@globieofficial) \n\n[ Goodest girl!\ud83d\udc36 art by  @Anzu\\_1026](https://preview.redd.it/hzfuypx1z47d1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f57678fd6570fbb17b46b0f1f218d70ef977c2b2)",

            "Ngl this line up really makes me wonder who\u2019s all was auditioning behind the scenes lol. Like I never really expected >!eilemonty!< and >!biscotti!< the talent pool must be insanely good",
            "D&D FAN?! \n\nBRO COUNT ME THE HELL IN BOIS",
            "anyone can figure who she is from her voice?",
            "So the mascot is an active part of the model. That\u2019s so fuckin cool",
            "Congrats to both Liz and Gigi! I was a fan of their PLs and found them super entertaining and talented. They averaged like 80 viewers\u2026 so I\u2019m glad they get a huge audience now!",
            "This lore video is an acid trip.",
            "is she >!biscotti!< ?",
            "~~111k~~ 131k subs and ~~50k~~ ~~117k~~ ~~120k~~ ~~117k~~ 115k watching already. Wowzers",
            "That's quite a unique debut(Hololive). Interactive chat is something I have not seen in a debut. Previous debuts sometimes feel prerecorded.\n\nDid she make that chat controlled game? If so, she really deserves the spot.",
            "Hope she doesn't feel too bad about failing that math check, EBR also borked her height conversion, lol",
            "The start screen is really cute.",
            "Omg, she\u2019s exactly right up my alley",
            "I couldn't hear her in the beginning but the laughs are the same. Either her voice is pitched up, or back then she was talking at a lower-ish register",
            "so this is why her PL was so short\n\nanyway very cool interactive debut",
            "Her cover of Hitomania actually goes hard as fuck. I've watched it like 10 times already and every time I notice some new subtlety in either the audio or visuals.\n\nIt's masterfully done and really artistic. Combined with the intro lore video I'm really digging this avant garde vibe. I'm excited to see more!\n\nMeanwhile I'll be over here listening to this cover another 100 times.",
            "Literal gremlin energy.",
            "Looks like she spent a lot of money for her debut",
            "Her dedication to the bit on her previous character was quite remarkable.\n\nI wonder, what she's gonna do with this one.",
            "So can anyone breakdown that kinda dark lore video in the beginning?",

            "automatically my fav debut just because of the maplestory, s4 league and grand chase BASED taste",
            "I'm hoping that Gigi can straddle around the stage >!like a certain horse Biscotti !<once she got her 3D debut.",
            "She went from 11k subs to 120k subs (Gigi). Kinda the same as Biboo. Both good talents, who joined the bigger company and saw a massive boost in numbers, I wish them all the best.",
            "It feels like just getting to join Hololive is such a good career move that they can get whoever they want really.",
            "yeah back then for >!eilemonty!< I thought she was becoming a fulltime VA, would have never expected her to join a Vtuber corpo",
            "Oh wow so HoloJustice were only preparing for 3 months. I was expecting longer",
            "Is she American or Aussie? I can't figure out from her accent.",

            "everyone knew before debut lol",
            "I think everyone has that thing set-up like that, the mascot moves the same as the model.",
            "yes. it's been mostly like that. even to their first member sora.",
            "I was tickled that I recognized both of their voices! Youtube had to help me remember Gigi's PL but she sounded super familiar. I still listen to songs Lizzy had sung in the past though, so that was an immediate connection.",
            "Can you dm me who liz was",
            "[removed]",
            "yes",
            "based on her drawing & that singing voice, yes",
            "her credits say it was [the creator of fugis that coded it!](https://x.com/Fugiman) those audio reactive images you see with discord calls",
            "[Shinri's debut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpXDBficVL4&t=1924s) had chat vote on which actions to take in an RPG-style combat. But yeah, in general it seems like that sort of thing is rare.",
            "Its cannon now! Gigi is bad at math!",
            "probably that's her natural voice as she also sounded the same back in nov last year-last mar",
            "Did any of her PL streams survive or were they all deleted? I watched all streams on Biboo's channel and I wanna watch more, yet I can only find clips of her PL.",
            "Wasn't Advent given 2-3 month preparations as well?",
            "It's probably more than that. If I remember correctly, Shinri's PL graduated/announced his indefinite hiatus on December 2022, but is probably already preparing at least since September of 2022",
            "I think they have longer than that. Once they have finalized the contract, there should be some grace period so if you're from other company or have some unfinished business to attend as indie, you have time to clear all those then graduate.",
            "Likely to be longer than that. They could have multiple contracts for different phases of the debuting to respect the talents' other contracts.\n\nA goodwill graduation is not something you just throw in within a short timeframe. There are all kinds of arrangements to settle the paperwork and project schedules with the grad date as the last public communication. It could be just the deadline for the full contract's entering, which requires legal uncompromised commitment.",
            "Given that she's from \"Freedonia\" (or somesuch), I suspect she's the lone yankee among the Justice crew.",
            "American for sure. Based just on voice she sounds just like some of my Filipino-American coworkers, so probably American with immigrant parents of some sort.",
            "listen to her laugh and look at the doodles she's done. also her timezone (according to holoen official tweet) and her interests line up",
            "honse\\*",
            "Wow, I did not see that one coming. Good for her. V4Mirai seems like a dope company but to also get picked up by Hololive is crazy.",
            "Damn, she left her last company so suddenly , I wonder if she already planned on doing this or simply changed her mind.",
            "Wait hampwn is Gigi?!! I thought ham was still active",
            "That doesn't really help those not in the know here though, does it?",
            "No they didn't, literally everyone thought she was someone else",
            "Any chance you could dm me?",
            "Yeah I just remembered Shiori\u2019s ink glob moves too",
            "It's on the other threads",
            "Literally the top comment of this thread",
            "Nice I just recently discovered her and was sad she left so soon but now I get to follow her again.",
            "I knew that pictures from somewhere and now I know it's from ex-Vshoujo tech",
            "Everything is there",
            "Yeah, they can't really do much more than that.\n\n3 months prep, up to 2 months to get paid by YouTube. That's nearly half a year without pay already, although Cover kicks in if they really need it.\n\nAdding a few more months to that would be extremely financially difficult for them.",
            "Advent had at least two months - their Hololive debuts were at the end of July 2023, and a couple of their PLs had their graduations at the end of May 2023.",
            "Oh I have no idea.",
            "Yeah, my first impression when I heard her talking was that she sounded a lot like Anya.",
            "Was it ever confirmed that she is part Filipino? Not gonna lie, but when I saw the list of MMORPGs she liked, a lot of them were the games that were very popular among the Filipinos around the early 2000's. Ragnarok, Flyff, Maple Story, etc. So I somewhat got the suspicion that she may be Filipino or at least has some relation to it.",
            "I see. Hoping that >!she gallops like a certain horse.!<",
            "I think she auditioned while at her last company on a whim and got accepted. The time frame adds up since she'd known she got in months ago and was excited to move on to the next stage. People thought she'd be leaving vtubing all together, not thinking she was moving up.",
            "wow same here, did not know ham moved on to another company, and now this. she was always a riot on scarra's streams. and the ff14 arc they had with sayu and other vtubers was peak content.",
            "LMFAO",
            "can u dm me when u know",
            "You mean on her twitch? Because on youtube I saw only 3 videos and 1 short, but thanks a lot for telling me!",
            "Didn't Holo have a base salary?",
            "this isn't confirmed at all just saying what her accent reminded me of",
            "I think it's more likely that she sent her applications to Brave and Cover at the same time, and Brave got her first, and then, months later, Cover got in touch and decided to buy her out.",
            "Yeah she spoke about financial and family problems in her \"first\" twitter profile so everybody thought she was going for a more full-time stable job.....but on the other hand if you are in Cover that solves it well enough.....",
            "Its in the thread already my man.",
            "Youtube. Her live section has all the streams and her videos go from debut teaser to her last cover 3 months ago",
            "Its alluded to be alittle above minimum (ave. \u00a5931/hr). They still get a salary even if they have their cuts iirc. Risu has expressed that that alone got her thru so much personal things.",
            "yeah, we don't know if it covers pre-debut or only after, but Cover would definitely help if needed",
            "Base salary is not that high though. Not enough to pay for rent in a small Tokyo apartment. Factor in the weak Yen and cost of living in Western countries I'm guessing it's barely enough to just pay utilities bill, or groceries.",
            "Whatever it is I just hope this won't create any bad blood between companies. Or with her former colleagues.",
            "Someone dm\u2019d me",
            "Thank you yet it seems I'm either too stupid to find the live section or there is no more live section on her PL account, only home, videos and shorts. Oh well, good thing she streams almost daily. Again, thank you very much for your help.",
            "Yeah but the lower limit acceptable for income is a little bit different from Indonesia compared to EU and US......it would be on the very lower end for that (although you might get additional benefits from the state at that stage)",
            "Yup I know, Tokyo is expensive...but at least even JP members arent required to live in tokyo, a bunch of their members still admit to living quite far or in rural areas. \n\nHopefully its enough to cover for their daily stuff in the meantime. Depending on where the EN members live that could go from enough to live off to barely I agree. Hopefully they started getting some money even during the training months",
            "In the vtuber world i think everyone knows that if hololive comes calling, you can't blame anyone for taking it.",
            ">!her old V4Mirai genmates were in her waiting room of her debut way before it started. its safe to say that they were really excited!<",
            "Are you on mobile?",
            "I *vaguely* recall Kronii's old colleagues and vtuber mama went crazy retweeting art of her, so I imagine people understand when its Hololive.",
            "Yeah at that point you have to take it. It's the golden ticket in the Vtubing world. Rather I'll be more surprised if someone didn't go through with it.",
            "No, PC. Why?",
            "I think you guys are getting mixed up. You want to watch Biboo's PL right? I think the other guy is telling you Gigi's is still readily available on YouTube since that's where Gigi's PL streamed.",
            "Maybe the layouts or UI is different idk. I\u2019m on the mobile app"

            "That explains her lack of streams and activity, goddamn, this explains a lot of things.\n\nEdit: wat an end, can't be EN stream without scuff. Also, I love the name reference, almost a call back to her own name.",
            "100% is her. I was 95% when she was talking but 100% once her powerful voice hit us. And 110% when the incredible impressions came out.\n\nI wondered why her channel suddenly went quiet 6 months ish ago. This is definitely the happiest answer to that question and I cannot wait to rejoin her membership :D",

            "You thought so too? Man, it's been so many years and of all the livers, THIS one was the one I thought: where have I heard that before? If it really IS her, it's a big step up from what she used to do.",
            "They're getting thousands of applicants and only 4-5 can debut. It is like how the top Korean Kpop companies keep churning out top kpop groups. And the bigger Hololive grows, the standards will keep increasing. Hololive has a clear branding and that makes those with specific aspirations as a vtuber know where to apply. Earlier on they focused on growing quickly with members that aren't necessarily gifted but can persevere in the streaming environment and there were several nepo hires too like the entirety of gamers. Even then their eye for gems is unparalleled and even now we have several late bloomers that finally managed to shine after several years.",
            "Biboo is the symbol of how strong Cover's scouting is. To go from a really, really small indie to one of the most popular Holo en members in less then a year",
            "I think Yagoo/COVER's talent scouts real skill is identifying people who deserve million dollar contracts and offering them said contracts before anyone else finds them",
            "The thing I love about Holo scouts is that they're not afraid to reject auditions outright and they keep coming back as a better version of themselves ready to be deserving success",

I'd love to hear the story behind that, honestly.\n\n(And that's not to say that nepo hires can't also be talented, I've seen that with much-maligned leftist streamer Hasan Piker. It just means that some very talented people don't get shots because the nepos get them first.)",

            "Weird my screen shows 118k still. Even refreshed",
            "glad the watchalong debut didn't destroy the on debut viewership. watchalong debut are great since more eyes to the debuting talents but it also lessens their debut viewership (which is also important) since other people will just watch at the watchalong to get 2 stuff at once.",
            "I\u2019ve got a running tally on Hololive and Stars, Phase, and I\u2019m gonna start tracking Globie too(hoping Kiri gets the long neck toggle) on my notes app lol",

            "I really wish I could tell ya but I didn\u2019t keep track of that lol",
            "Yeah, I was a little surprised to see her previous channel *obliterated*, since we know for a fact that avoiding previous professional identities is absolutely *not* a requirement for Hololive and she had some seriously impressive accomplishments previously, apparently.\n\nAt least that's 100% up to her, but it was a little surprising to see. Still, she's already earned a silver button on the first *day* and with her talents, I'm absolutely certain she'll go far.",
            "Ah. I don\u2019t watch too much Bettel",
            "Oh, she'd said something? I must have missed her last stream, I just realised I hadn't seen her live in ages and found out she'd locked down her account when I couldn't find her cover of \"not ready\" :'-(",
            "She'd said on stream that she wanted to focus on her singing rather than VA work a few months before she disappeared, so I guess in hindsight this fits the bill",
            "Well technically she is a full time Va for hololive. So you weren't wrong.",
            "I discovered that gen of MLP thanks to server-hopping in TF2. I found one where people micspammed MLP songs (and a lot of Queen) which I thought was fun, so I hung around it for a long time. \n\nI *recognized* Lizzy's voice real fast because I was listening to a lot of MLP and FNAF songs back then. That hasn't happened since Fuwamoco, but I think everyone knew who they were gonna be. I've never seen threads explode like they did when those two returned. \n\nGigi sounded familiar and I couldn't remember why, but Youtube-kun helpfully sidebarred clips of her PL and I had that fucking Leonardo DiCaprio Pointing moment. \n\nEveryone thinks they know who Rao-Rao Fight the Powah is gonna be, but I'm still clueless on Cecy.",

            "I think Ollie is known for scouting out new talents, I remember seeing a clip once where she popped up in Bae's PL VTuber stream with her official Hololive account, which was also very obvious xD\n\nAnd >!Caitlin!< is incredible well connected due to her history as a cover song singer and anime voice actress. I wouldn't be surprised if she followed >!EileMonty!< for years or if they know each other personally from cons and stuff, but I think there is no way of seeing how long someone follows a Twitter account.",
            "From what I remember fubuki recruited mio, who then recommended Okayu and Korone to fill up the slots in Gamers",
            "IIRC it's as simple as they were goods friends of our friend (Fubuki).",
            "Which also speaks to the strength of the brand that such talent would rather keep applying for Holo after getting rejected twice than settling for a different corpo.\n\nA lot of these talents aren't just looking to be in a corpo, they're looking to be in *Hololive*.",
            "the first time she literally applied without having any videos or streams done.....and many had to apply more than once even with a working portfolio....find me one hiring agent that can extrapolate without any background how good and dedicated somebody is",

            "The watchalong doesn't include audio from the debut stream to avoid this exact problem.",
            "Globie is kind of a silent runner up that has potential to be big. We'll have to see how their growth happens over the next year.",

            "check out the youtube channel >!mashed!< she voices pretty much all the female characters in their animations",
            "It's sorta a daisy chain thing iirc. Mio got in on Foob's recommendation, then Mio suggested Okayu apply and Korone followed Okayu because Okakoro is real.",
            "Some of them might be considered mutants or have mutated traits, but hololive is more into showing their talents in music, arts and games than say using temporal powers, reaping souls or keeping a FAQQING monkey (IT'S ALIVE! \ud83c\udf29\ufe0f)",
            "oh didn't know that, ive only watched the debut streams. thats indeed a good way to negate the negatives of watchalong debut.",

            "oh dang I watched a few never realized",
            "Mio didn't get in on Fubuki's recommendation. Fubuki did not know Mio applied and neither [did Mio tell her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elL7NK5Se4A).",
            "They are putting absolute work into marketing themselves so they deserve it",

            "Was that... unexpected?",
            "Yes, it\u2019s actually a running joke among the girls of Phase Connect that their female viewership is too low to get sponsorships from otome games they might want to play on stream. In particular, some of them wanted to get sponsored by Love and Deepspace I think it\u2019s called. Chisaka Airi even did a joke stream to brainstorm ways to get her female viewership up, and that stream had even less female viewers than average.\n\nSome girls do get higher female viewership, but I think it\u2019s a matter of the type of content you make and what you choose to talk about.",
            "The female Vtubers are everywhere meanwhile the male viewers are bountiful\n\nExpect this to stay consistent for the future\n\nIt takes a lot more work for male Vtubers to stand out too imho (especially if you don't have an instantly-pleasing/sultry voice)",
            "Connor/Cdawgva used to have 93% female viewership back when he started out. So it can happen the other way around too. (Even if he wasn't really a Vtuber back then).",
            "Yes",
            "I think the Vtuber audience is just predominantly male. I can only think of a few vtubers with a majority female audience, and it's usually the BFE type male vtubers. Not always, of course, but that's the common theme I've noticed.",
