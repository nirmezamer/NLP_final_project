Bolted properly to three or four studs and there should be no issues holding up around 200 lb of water. Hopefully they over engineered it for the weight though just in case.

I'm not an expert of English language pertaining to construction work, but weren't those called something like \"prefabricated\"?

I honestly think even those are way sturdier and way more reliable than the wood and cardboard houses Americans keep making for whatever reason I honestly can't explain to myself . Is it just because it's cheaper? I honestly can't see the advantage of having walls you can demolish by punch and kick and main house doors any adult could kick open with ease.",
