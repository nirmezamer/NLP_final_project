            "The new year has come once again, as 2023 has faded into the sunset and 2024 has risen to replace it with the morning's light. As is tradition, /r/Polandball has put together our greetings to the new year in the form of our annual Calendar for 2024.\n\nHowever, if you've kept track with previous calendars, you might be wondering \"wait, where are the other 11 months of the year?\" Well, to spice things up for the new year, we're opting to release the calendar month by month to keep the interest rolling along throughout the year! Be sure to tune in at the start of each month to catch what we've been working on!\n\nOver the course of the several-long-month gestation of this year's calendar, 30 artists have put their pens to paper and made some great art for this project, but of course, you'll have to wait to see some of their art.\n\n---\n\n[**You can learn more about what every panel represents here!**](https://imgur.com/gallery/EX42Oz6)\n\nOf course, the Calendar is made to be enjoyed all year:\n\n* The **sidebars of both /r/polandball and /r/PolandballCommunity** will be updated daily to display the day's panel.\n* **[Moderator /u/AndyRedditor has once again produced a widget for the Calendar that you can download and install!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-tIfW9hqi-UMaT86B3VSIPfZHNqcYkeF/view?usp=sharing)** Download the file from the link, unpack it, and follow the instructions in the README file.

Hagia Sophia is the icon of Constantinople. So a wall between -it- and a cannon could suggest a siege on the city is about to happen (in hindsight i prob should've made the cannon facing the fortress)\n\n- All of Venice's phrasing are a bit vague and actually have a double perspective -\n\n**Panel 3**: Venice's explanation on the Hagia Sophia is that it means \"Byzantine will soon have a large amount of religious people\". This could mean a big increase in piety in Christianity, but as it turns out it's actually a bunch of Muslims coming and conquering the land. Either way, the wording fits  \n   I'll also point out how in the background of the Hagia Sophia, you could see a minaret. ^((foreshadowing!!!))\n\n**Panel 4:** Constantinople did become greater. Just... not under Byzantine rule^(\\[citation needed. didn't do research on this\\])\n\n**Panel 5**: Venice says Byzantine will have a cannon outside the city walls to fight the enemy. He did very soon, and the cannon belonged to the Ottomans and enemy was him instead (could've phrased it better tbh)\n\n**Panel 6-7**: All of the things Venice said comforted Byzantine into thinking there wouldn't be a siege. Everything he said was true, but I guess he was not too keen on the details, as that actually ended up happening\n\nFun fact about this comic, I recorded myself drawing this in mspaint. So I might make some kind of 'making of' vid on this later",
