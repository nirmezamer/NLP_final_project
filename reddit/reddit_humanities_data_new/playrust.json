            "I think they did, in that you can now stack them to reach a higher bait value.",
            "I mean, it was never really a minmax strat. It was just something cool you could do if you wanted to do something fun. Scrap farming barrels in the ocean with a tea is more scrap and just as safe. Fert farming is similar. \n\nNow, it's just kinda useless, even in a niche kinda way.",
            "All you need to do is look at the wiki... 0-2.5 is junk and 0-5 is small fish. That's how it works.",
            "20 min or so. That was back before you had to feed your TC too keep it up, so bases were crazy big and online raids could last hours sometimes. The shit was wild.",
            "You're projecting your own experience on others.\n\n1. Not \"so many\" people are despawning.\n\n2. They're doing it out of spite to troll the raiders, not out of boredoom.\n\n3. The fact that they're despawning proves how much loot means to them, because despawning 8+ boxes of loot takes a lot of time. If loot doesn't mean anything to you, you'd just quit the game and not waste time on despawning.",
            "Genuine question, why?",
            "If you want to fight over the fertiliser trader, sure.",
            "Scrap farming in the ocean and fertilize farming is objectively less safe though. For fishing you were able to just plop down in the safe zone at the fishing village and get scrap risk free. \n\nThose other ones you're at least out in the open and taking on some kind of risk. The fishing changes just require you to have a little more bait, it's not that big of a deal.",
            "You still get loot and food from the fish no?\n\nI used fishing to complete all tech trees in a few no bp servers I play on. It was too easy to get stacks of scrap in a safezone or your base. It was like metal detecting in the safe zone which was patched as well.",
            "Ah that sounds like fun, but like you said maybe not the healthiest lol",
            "So despawning at all = trolling raiders, got it",
            "What do you mean?\n\nIt'll be dope!\n\nWere gonna build on the sweaty island and try and grub mofos who come across.\n\nWere gonna scuba jump off of it directly to oil, so we don't have to wait for a respawn, etc etc...\n\nThis opens up so many high level plays",
            "Fishing for scrap off the safe zone isn't even what got nerfed here. You can still do it risk free and the results aren't that different. What got nerfed here is people's ability to do it in bases designed to fish, instead of setting up fert farms or ocean farming.",
            "It was strictly worse then making a cloth farm or a fert farm. It was more effort for less reward and essentially the exact same risk. \n\nYes, you still get loot from it, but now instead of making 1.4k scrap an hour from cloth or fert farming, you have the option to make like 500 scrap an hour from fishing.",
            "If you despawn before logging off, yes it is.\n\nIf you're putting any time in anything regarding loot (like I said, despawning takes time and extra effort), this means you care about other people not getting the loot. This means you care about loot.\n\nE.g., when I'm done with the server, I just remove doors or leave them open for anyone to come in and take whatever, including the base itself. Because I know how cool it is to find that kind of stuff as a fresh spawn.\n\nIf I knew some toxic shit clan was going to raid me, I'd definitely despawn and leave 12h worth of upkeep in TC.\n\nBoth cases show that I understand the value of loot and I do care about it, to some degree.",
            "> Fishing for scrap off the safe zone isn't even what got nerfed here.\n\nIf this wasn't nerfed then player fishing bases didn't get nerfed.",
            "You say it is not minmaxing but talk about the scrap rate per hour not being efficient enough for you.",
            "So if I despawn all my loot, and by proxy my entire base, which will never be raided because it will decay, I am trolling?",
            "Yes, because there's a difference between minmaxing your time, enjoying your time, and wasting your time. Fishing is the latter, Missile Silo is the former.",
            "Why do you despawn?",
            "Because I had enough pvp or rp and I got bored, next server or next game. Doesn't matter if it's vanilla, 2x, 10x, PVE or PVP. I have the right to withdraw from any life as I so choose, that much is inalienable. I'm not required to exist in this world, much less in rust.",
            "Okay, but why do you put your time (which you could've spent any way you wanted) into despawning loot?"

He specified that I \"do not have to play with it until I lose\" but that I can't just collect it, clear the wager requirement, and withdraw. I apologized and said, having been informed of that, that I would refrain from doing that again and asked about what wager amount/type of wager/etc. I need to comply with the rules. \n\nFast forward like 6 hours later and I am banned all over again. In the 6\\~ hours leading up to this 2nd ban I had not played/deposited/withdrew whatsoever. I work from home and don't play during \"working hours\" (though I do claim rains and bonus codes if I see them pop up on my 2nd monitor).   \n  \nThis time, a new moderator (Obscurity) decided to reply after making me wait over an hour and said that \"Apollo clearly stated that what I was doing was wrong\" and that the ban was legitimate and permanent before inviting me to make a new account to start over as a level 1.\n\nI don't know about the rest of the community here but this is insanely unscrupulous and shady behavior in my book. Not expecting to get unbanned (being insulated from such a place is probably for the best anyway) but I hope that some people at least see this and have a chance to avoid being taken advantage of/admin abused.\n\n  \nScreenshots of the original chat with Apollo: [https://imgur.com/a/RyAgdcg](https://imgur.com/a/RyAgdcg)\n\nI don't have the link for the transcript with the moderator because I haven't received an email of it yet and I closed out of the page because I was pretty sure he was intentionally being snarky with me to get a rise out of me at that point.

That's 40 hours of sitting on this site collecting money and not playing.)\n* This sure does reek of a \"I wasn't cheating & got banned\" type of post.\n* This has almost 0 to do with Rust, the game.\n* Did you actually lose anything of value? Can you not make a new account?\n\nI play on Rustclash too. I'm level 56. I login for daily cases and promo codes just like you. If I get a big hit I'll withdraw otherwise I play till 0 balance. I haven't deposited in quite some time. I am not banned.\n\nRustclash has to have free play in order to operate legally. You are walking into a casino that is required to give you a few pennies at the door, waiting at said door to collect until you have a few dollars, then leaving without actually risking anything. Plinko is a guaranteed payout, 50/50 upgrader on a 10 cent item a large number of times would leave your balance relatively the same, and both of these would let you get over the threshold minimum of you being required to gamble before you withdraw.\n\nYou're trying to weasel your way to a few bucks on a technicality and got caught and banned, now you ran to Reddit to cry wolf.

I am not trying to weasel any pennies lol. My upgrader spins ranged from $5 item to $250 items 99.9% of the time. I think you erred in presuming a number of things including that I was doing 10 cent upgrader spins or exclusively playing low risk plinko.  \n  \nFor reference here are my stats on another site: [https://imgur.com/a/umz8TKb](https://imgur.com/a/umz8TKb)\n\nI am not a small time player on these sites. I am/have been on them all. This was never about profit, just entertainment. I work from home and collect the daily rewards as advertised during the day and when I have time off I sometimes enjoy depositing and having those daily rewards as a boost to my deposit. I don't see anything unreasonable or greedy about doing that.  \n  \nEither way, you are entitled to your opinion regardless of how well informed or not it may be.",
