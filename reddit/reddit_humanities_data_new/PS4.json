            "PS4 suddenly got the error code CE34788-0. Help needed\n\nI plugged the USB file with the update file and it wouldnt recognize it. So I researched on the internet and found an alternative way which is initializing ps4 basically formatting everything. I did that and it worked but then I got the prompt to update the ps4 to 11.5. I did that and after restarting I got an error message and it went back to giving the error code of plugging in the dualshock controller and a usb with the update file of 8.00 but that does not work. Any tips?",
            "Help please!\n\nBeyond the Dawn (Tales of Arise DLC) is not showing up in my PS4 library for download on my PS4.\n\nIt shows up under my transaction history on the ps store website but when I go to Library on my PS4 the expansion is nowhere to be seen.\n\nWhen I search \"Tales of Arise - Beyond the Dawn Expansion\" on the ps store you see a thumbnail of the game and under it, it says \"unavailable\".\n\nWhen I click on the thumbnail I go to a page that has:\n\n# Tales of Arise - Beyond the Dawn Expansion\n\nBandai Namco Entertainment America Inc.Tales of Arise - Beyond the Dawn Expansion\n\nRating  \\*\\*\\*\\* (7 ratings)\n\nOwned\n\nSo as you see, below the rating it says \"Owned\".

I have both US and European versions of games that all work, including a European version of Tales of Arise base game.

Start/restart and power on/power off, turn off/turn on internet did not work.\n\nSo am I out 20 dollars?  PS support was of little help.  Even though I have a US account I live in Europe but they don't want to help via a European support phone number.",
            "**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**\n\n\n**Q: My controller won't connect despite being plugged into the console. It charges/is charged but I'm stuck on the press the PS button screen.**\n\nA: You need a USB data cable to pair a controller with a console, instead of a generic  USB charging cable. They look the same but a charging cable only charges, it cannot send a data signal which is necessary for controller pairing. USB Data cables are necessary for safe mode operation as well.\n \nIt's a common mistake. \n\nAmazon lists cables as data cables if you need to purchase one. Other retailers will also list data on cable packaging.\n\nhttps://www.dignited.com/50330/usb-data-cable-vs-usb-charging-cable/amp/\n\nAlso, don't forget to press and hold the reset button on the back of the controller for 5-10 seconds before connecting it. This is recommended when using your DS4 on a PC or other device before connecting back to a PS4.\n\n**Q: My account is saying I don't own a game when I know I do. How do I fix this?**\n\nA: restore licenses in settings > account management \n\nhttps://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/games/restore-licences-playstation/\n\nCheck your account on the Playstation Store website. If you own it you can remote download it, you can also check tour transaction history there too. If you still can't access the game it was either:\n\n1. Purchased on disc thus not owned digitally\n\n2. Purchased on a different account and game shared to your account. Remember, you can play a game without owning it. Having trophies is meaningless when proving ownership as you can earn trophies from disc games and games owned by a friend.\n\n3. Obtained using PS+ and your subscription ran out. Your monthly games can be retrieved by resubscribing.\n\n4. Obtained with PS+ Extra and it was removed from the service. \n\nIf you don't think it's the above 4 options, contact support.\n\n\n**Q: I am missing a DLC that I purchased. How can I fix this?**\n\nA: follow the detailed instructions here. Otherwise contact support \n\nhttps://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/games/add-on-dlc-in-game-currency-support/\n\n**Q: How do I fix \"Cannot sign in using another player's sign in ID.\"?**\n\nA: You are signing into either the wrong user profile or the wrong Playstation account. To solve this sign into your PSN account on the different user profiles until you sign into the correct one. If you cannot use any user profile due to the above message, make a new user profile for your PSN account.\n\nPS4s use user profiles. Each user profile that is set up can then be tied to a single Playstation account. Thus you cannot sign out of a PSN account on a user profile and sign in with a different Playstation account. As such, 2 Playstation accounts each need their own separate user profile on a PS4.\n\nYou also cannot sign into a single Playstation account on 2 different user profiles on the same PS4. So if you want to use a new account with a PS4, make a new user profile.\n\n**Q: My console is saying I don't have enough storage space for an update even though I do.**\n\nA: You don't. If the console is asking you to free up space on your HDD then you must do as the PS4 asks. When the PS4 updates a game, it makes a copy of it on your HDD that is deleted once the update is applied. This means that a 50GB game requires 50GB free on the HDD + the size of the update. COD being a massive game can require 100GB+ free depending on its current size.\n\nI recommend giving your PS4 a 100GB buffer to update your games. If you only have a 500GB HDD I also recommend an external HDD or upgrading your Internal HDD to a 2TB drive.\n\n\n**Q: How do I game share digital games/PS+?**\n\nPS5\nhttps://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/account/ps5-console-sharing-offline-play/#\n\nPS4\n\nhttps://manuals.playstation.net/document/gb/ps4/settings/activation.html#\n\nA: You can game share with 1 PS4 and PS5 at a time, known as your Primary console. Instructions above. Multiple accounts can have the same Primary console.\n\nAgain, you can only game share with 1 PS4 at a time, so if you want to game share with someone else use the same path to deactivate the PS4 or use the website to deactivate remotely.\n\nIf it doesn't work right away then restore licenses on the account that owns the games.\n\nGames and DLC can share between users, however some DLC is account locked so cannot be shared between users. DLC and game need to be the same region first in order to game share.\n\nYou can still access your games on any other PS4 you sign into, even if it's not your Primary PS4, simply by being signed into the PSN, but no one else on the non-Primary PS4 can play your games.\n\n**Q: I keep getting error E-8210604a when attempting to make a purchase. How do I fix it?**\n\nA: The error is more or less a catch all, use the advice on the following link and beyond that contact support for more help. In the meantime you can complete your purchase using Playstation wallet vouchers to fund your wallet.\n\n\nhttps://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/error-codes/ps4/e-8210604a/\n\n**Q: Pros and cons of changing your Online ID?**\n\nA: its safe for most modern games but some exceptions exist. For more information:\n\nhttps://blog.playstation.com/2019/04/10/online-id-change-on-psn-your-questions-answered/\n\n**Q: I have lost access to my account/want to refund a purchase. How do I do this?**\n\nA: Only support can help in these cases. Support is region locked so if you have a USA account only the USA Support team can help you. Most Support teams are open Monday-Saturday usually around 10-7PM and most Countries only offer phone or live chat support. \n\nThe Support site is easily googled/linked in the side bar for Live chat.\n\nThe phone number is on the Support website, inside your game cases and also listed here:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yyg6CDcHkMSQ40bGtRax6BuNqie5ym7wHSjRNISX9Cw/\n\n**Q: Can I change the region of my account?**\n\nA: No. If you want an account set to a different region you must make a brand new account.\n\n**Q: My voucher code isn't redeeming. What can I do?**\n\nA: Vouchers are region locked so a USA voucher will not work on a European account. Also make sure your voucher code has not expired if the game is a few years old. For PS+ vouchers you may be required to add a credit card to your account for auto renewal purposes.\n\nAnything beyond that contact support.\n\n\n**Q: Are games region locked?**\n\nA: Yes. PS4, PS3 and PS5 Games are region coded so that USA DLC and saved data only works with USA copies of the game. \n\nA French account/console can play a USA game disc but French DLC won't work with it. If an American account is used to purchase DLC the French account can play that DLC too assuming it is shareable between users ie not in game currency.\n\n**Q: purchased a new copy of a game to continue my game save but it doesn't appear when I launch the game.**\n\nA: First of all make sure the game is fully updated with the latest patch and check again.\n\nOtherwise, saved data and DLC are region locked. So if you played an American copy of a game you created an American game save that cannot be read by a copy of the game from a different part of the world.\n\nAlso, Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is considered a different game to Witcher 3 GoTY so the saves are incompatible between both games even if from the same region.\n\n\n**Q: I have purchased DLC for a game and it is stuck at 'waiting to install'. How do I fix this?**\n\nA: If you launch the game and the DLC still will not install, this is down to a region mismatch. DLC and saved data are region locked, meaning DLC purchased on a USA account will not work with a European game disc/digital copy. To resolve this you either need to open an account matching the region of your game and purchase the DLC there (some DLC is account locked so cannot share). Or alternatively purchase a copy of the game from your region. Otherwise contact support for a refund, but no guarantees if one will be given.\n\n**Q: How do I know the region of my game disc?**\n\nA: Look at the age rating on the front cover. ESRB rated games are American, PEGI is Europe, etc. For more specific region info there is the CUSA code printed on the game disc that can be checked on an online database such as gamefaqs. DLC region codes are listed as part of the Playstation store URL.\n\nhttps://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps4/190457-dragon-ball-xenoverse-2/data\n\nAbove link is an example, in the link you see a list of different regional releases and their CUSA codes. So long as the CUSA matches, the DLC will work with your game.\n\n**Q: How do I fix: 'Connect a USB storage device that contains an update file for reinstallation for version X or later.'**\n\nA: The data on your HDD has been lost so is requiring a fresh installation of the system software. Your purchases and trophies are safe as they are tied to your account but any saved data not backed up has been lost. The above message is part of the BIOS so to get back up and running follow these instructions:\nhttps://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/reinstall-playstation-system-software-safe-mode/\n\nConsole reinstallation file can also be found here if the above link doesn't work for you:\nhttps://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/ps4/system-software/\n\nGeneral pointers:\n\n\u2022 Make sure that you are using the console reinstallation file and not the update file.\n\n\u2022 Your USB stick needs a folder called PS4 and inside that folder a second one called UPDATE\n\n\u2022 Inside the UPDATE folder is where you put the reinstallation file\n\n\u2022 The reinstallation file must be called PS4UPDATE.PUP otherwise it won't be recognised by the console. So remove any (1)s if they appear as part of the file name as that just obscures it.",

            "So, years ago, I decided to save scum in Elden Ring to get the Frenzied Flame and regular endings. So I uploaded my save to a USB, went to an earlier save,  did FF and then closed the game for two years until today. But when I downloaded my USB data back to the PS4, I was told that it was corrupted. Worse, my PS4 decided to \"back up from system memory,\" except now I'm on the title screen with only the option to start game. No load or anything. So, is there any way to fix the corrupted data or am I fucked? I have no idea how a USB's data can be corrupted\n\nI'm confused about the game \"backing up from system storage\" but then not having any save data. Is there a way to check for earlier saves?",
            "For the past few days, my ps4 has been randomly disconnecting the controllers. It\u2019s happening to BOTH controllers. I\u2019ve tried resetting them but that doesn\u2019t work.

I had to shut off my ps4 and reset my controller for it to work for 1 day (the other one still didn\u2019t work). Now, in the middle of me playing, the controller disconnected. Pressing the ps4 button makes the light flash for a long time. Plugging in just makes the orange light (my cable is the correct type of cable, I\u2019m pretty sure. I used it to pair these controllers when I bought them new 2 years ago.) I managed to connect it again by turning off my ps4 and having my controller plugged in to the console. It worked for about 2 minutes before it went back to disconnected.",

It's just how the Playstation Network was designed. European games require European DLC and cannot read or register DLC purchased from any other region."

            "i got an old xbox 360 recently and being able to just immediately play a game i just bought is crazy",
            "if a disc is copying, im fine, what infuriates me is games like cod ww2 and the mw reboot. get the disc and unstill have to dona 120gb download like\ud83d\udc80",
            "I don\u2019t really mind because of the reasons and benefits of it, discs have to install because the read speed of the disc drive is much slower than the HDD and especially an SSD, so games get faster loading and data streaming.\n\nNot to mention, the disc drive turns itself off after it\u2019s done installing/authenticating, so it makes a lot less noise and lessens the wear and tear on the drive since it doesn\u2019t need to constantly spin while playing.",
            "Yep absolutely. Miss popping in a game and just playing.\u00a0",
            "Without a doubt, I still play my PS2 a lot, I just like sticking that game in and playing.",
            "I like discs in that I can sell or trade them after I'm done but the convenience of hopping back and forth between games without changing discs is too sweet.",
            "I miss it on release day when I just want to play the game I've been waiting for, and the clock keeps ticking, eating away my potential playtime on a work night. \n\nAfter that, I'm fine with it. I'll take PS5 load times over PS1 any day.",
            "Kinda? But also I just download the game or install the disc the day before I want to play something. I personally try and focus on one or two games at a time but have a list of games I want to play in the future. \n\nFor example, my long term game on my PS5 is Elden Ring. Then I have a handful of games that I know I want to play but will likely do after Elden Ring. So if I finished Elden Ring, I already have God of War 3 Remastered, the Bioshock Trilogy, Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2, and Detroit Become Human installed. I want to play all of these at some point and some of them I have played before but want to platinum. \n\nSo to me it doesn't make a huge difference. With my PS4 I kept a lot of games installed but didn't play them for months and months. This is why I personally never got an extended storage for my PS5. I can keep around 10-15 games installed and if there is something I really want to play, I can just install it that night and play it the next time. \n\nI feel that I used to get so upset at games needing to download in addition to the Disc because I was a kid. I had just gotten a game from the store and wanted to play it right away. However, as I grew up I realized it isn't the end of the world if a game has a download or update or whatever.",
            "I like the faster load times. I don\u2019t really care about playing games immediately as I have already waited however long to get the game in the first place so what\u2019s another 20 minutes. I also almost entirely go with digital and most of my PS5 games take like 10 minutes to download.",
            "Crash bandicoot Nsane trilogy. Only 1 on disc, 2 & 3 is a download!",

            "I'm confused. Discs install data on the console no?",
            "Not really. I think as soon as you have any pc exposure it feels like the norm. Used to have to install using a disc. Now you just buy digitally and have to download. Same thing.",

            "I somewhat got to terms with it when it comes to larger games, as the hard drive's loading times are usually faster than the disc drive's.\n\nHowever, I really dislike having to copy/install _each and every_ small indy game, which could easily be played from disc, not needing or benefiting from the faster loading times.\n\nCatQuest, PuyoPuyo, Unertale, Deer Simulator, Duke Nukem 3D...why can't I play _those_ off the disc?",

            "Yeah... :'(",
            "It\u2019s the reason I went back to PC after this generation. I loved being able to just put on a disc and play on my 360, and on my PS4 I was constantly running out of disc space and waiting for giant installs and updates.\n\nBasically it felt like the plug and play advantage of consoles was gone. So when the Ps5 and the Series X rolled around I just figured a gaming PC was the better option. Higher initial cost, but way more variety in games and substantially better sales on software. Ends up costing way less over the lifetime and ALL games are backwards compatible.",
            "Miss? I do that regularly, my PS4 needs discs all the time and my retro PC uses disks and floppys too!",
            "As opposed to having to change disc multiple times if it's a huge game? Or worse, a disc that only works to download the actual game from the servers as if the disk is only the access code for the download.\n\nI'm fine with an install disc and then only using one disc for the rest of the playthrough.",
            "Grew up with consoles and PC, so the install process doesn't faze me. It's nice that games are on one disc now, well, for the most part.",
            "My disc-entering era has finally over ever since they introduced us the HDD-PS2 system.",
            "I don't mind, but then, you get very long load times, even for things like opening doors, area transitions, etc.",

            "No",
            "Most days the disk is just a license key, with any install needing a big patch and updates.\n\nI am thankful however as I've used my PS4 disks to unlock free upgrades to PS5 native versions of games like Borderlands 3, No Man's Sky, Doom Eternal, Skyrim, Metro: Exodus, Cyberpunk 2077.",
            "I am fine with It, most of the times is the dlcs what take like 2 hrs",
            "It was convenient, sure. But it was also a time where games weren't so quality as they are now. Hence being smaller and fitting on a disc.\n\nId take the better quality any day.",
            "I would install the game to the hard drive anyway as you have the option. It would mean the game would load faster, make less noise as the disc wasn\u2019t constantly spinning, saving your disc drive too.",
            "Yeah, the Xbox 360 was definitely better at having just small updates before you played. PS3, you often had to wait 30 minutes or longer while it installed the game or downloaded a huge update. There weren't many Xbox 360 games that had big updates or install times like that.",
            "This. My first ever experience was with cod mw. I was so confused that I had to install some many things for diffrent features. I miss when campaign, local multiplayer, online and all others features came on a single 30 GB disc.",
            "Yup yup, I also played PC games on the side so the idea of installing games is something I'm used to by the time it comes to consoles.\n\nMy old PS2 also had issues where it can't read the Disk multiple times causing stuff like long load times or freezing. Installing games like nowadays really lessens those disc based problems.",
            "I buy singleplayer games on disc and stick to multiplayer digitally. Saves time with friends and lets me focus on finishing one rpg or something at a time",
            "That's nsane",
            "Why can't we go back. It's not like memory is expensive any more.",
            "It didn't become ubiquitous until PS4/XBone era. For PS360, it was a rare thing (although of course updates and DLC are stored on the console). Usually you could just pop the disc into a console with no internet connection and play without installing anything.",
            "It's mandatory on the PS4 & PS5. On the the PS3 it wasn't. at least not always.",
            "Especially since the bloody thing won't install games in sleep mode\n\nWorse, I made the mistake of getting the $10 cheaper PS4 version of Horizon Forbidden to be Interested in the plot, and downloading the PS5 version took hours",
            "Larger size \u2260 quality. There are plenty of games from the Xbox 360 era and earlier that are of equal quality or better then a lot of modern games. Quality has no correlation with the size of the game, unless you\u2019re specifically talking about graphical quality.",
            "I went through all that and still wasn't able to get the campaign. Whatever I needed was \"No Longer Available in the store\"\n\nI'm currently using the game case as a coaster",
            "Ah okay I got it. Correct me if I'm wrong but besides the data copying (which usually takes minimal time) many PS4 discs can still be played without anything downloading no?",
            "So miss something that hasn't occurred in over a decade?  you know you're not on /r/PS3, right?",
            "Im talking about everything quality, which does include graphical quality, yes. Which does result in larger file sizes.\n\nSo technically, larger does equal quality. But no where am I saying older games do not have quality. \n\nThey do however, have outdated graphics and mechanics which can make a game not as enjoyable and can hinder its story telling by not having the same ability to show us detailed facial expressions and gloomy atmospheres, just as some examples.",
            "Without updates or extra data? Yeah, I think that a lot of my games can.",
            "You only miss recent stuff? Damn, must be nice",
            "well the switch does it if you want a recent example"
