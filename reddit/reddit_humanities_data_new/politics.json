This is on top of the already 33% of Americans that are right wingers that see the courts as failed institutions, drain the swamp, deept state yadda yadda.\n\n  \nThe republicans since the 90s made Congress a failed body. Every year since 1994, when Democrats lost their 50 yr majority, Congress has been going down in approval ratings, and passing fewer and fewer bills and more deadlock. For at least 14 years now voters on both sides have considered Congress failed and weak as an institution. \n\n\n\nSince 2008 the republicans have considered the executive as a failed branch, since Obama won really. Same with the middle and left since 2016s Trump. Executive actions are increasingly taking the place of bills, the executive is increasingly to blame or praise for anything that happens,\n\n  \nThere is an absolute rot in our institutions. An attack on them for 50 years now, with the express purpose of convincing americans they are victims of corrupt institutions and are powerless to change them. Tump may lose in Nov. and in fact Democrats may win in 28 and 32 as well. But the faith, trust, and respect in our govt institutions is gone and I domt know how to get it back.

            "Sooo this is a dog whistle for people who are part of the lgbt+ community. The case was not about whether the two could marry. The case was about being married AND her husband getting a visa because of that marriage. \n\nThe United States used the same investigative steps that they do with all people who come into this country, found out that this dude is part of a gang. Not just any gang though, this gang is an international gang that literally kills its own members if they find out/think they are gay and made it a point to murder trans people at a park in New York not too long ago\u2026.why are we using a person who\u2019s gang association implies that this person is a piece of shit who hates lgbt+ people, to defend gay marriage?  And why the fuck are we casually conflating a criminal and lgbt+ people? Thats fucking offensive\u2026\n\nShe can still marry this dude. He is not a citizen and never will be ( thank god) and therefore has 0 rights in this country. She accepted that and knew that when she married him because they had to apply for him to live here. With her logic if someone marries someone who is in jail, the person who is in jail gets immediately released because it\u2019s their right to live together. Do you know how many insane people have married murderers, rapist and pedophiles who are in prison?( all of which this gang he\u2019s affiliated with happen to actively condone and participate in included prostituting children)\u2026..One too many.\n\nThis has nothing to do with lgbt+\u2026.this is clearly a means to get a knee jerk reaction from a specific group and to continue the narrative that only the conservative judges  are capable of being corrupt.

            "As someone with a Republican mother, I can offer a few reasons (she's straight, but these reasons still apply) \n\n1: So many of them watch stuff like Fox and Newsmax all day every day.  Glenn Beck literally got my mother thinking Obama might be the Antichrist.  To her, any move to the left was just a slippery slope to the destruction of the Constitution and implementation of Communism.  It's really hard to convince someone who's been so hard-wired to hate one side and literally spends hours every day being given reasons to hate the one side that they're hating the wrong side.\n2:  They have a bad habit of thinking the people they vote for are like them.  My Mom repeated a Glenn Back line of, \"What's wrong with making America great again?  Every American should want that.\"  The problem is, Trump and the other Republicans are going by *their own* definition, not her's.  She can't comprehend that Republican lawmakers think America was better back when she had no rights or freedoms.\n3:  They assume Republicans are for small government.  Mom absolutely refuses to believe that that's just a line they use and that they'll absolutely abuse federal power whenever they can.  E.g., she believes strongly in States' Rights and believes the federal government shouldn't get to tell states what to do, beyond the rights guaranteed in the Constitution and Bill of Rights.  She believes if you don't like what a state does, you can simply pick up sticks and move.  She refuses to believe that Republicans only say that because the Fed sometimes steps in to stop Red states from doing stuff they want sometimes, and that Republicans will gladly use the federal government to force blue states to live the way Republicans want if they are able to.",

            " It's one of the reasons George Washington, in his farewell speech, warned of the dangers of a two party system taking hold in America.  He knew it would overwhelm the checks and balances and cause exactly what it's causing in the US right now.  What he didn't know was that there were some motherfuckers out there who would take his warning as instructions.\n \n> I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the State, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally.\n \n> This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, or repressed; but, in those of the popular form, it is seen in its greatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\n \n> The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of public liberty.\n \n> Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight), the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n \n> It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.\n \n> There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks upon the administration of the government and serve to keep alive the spirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true; and in governments of a monarchical cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, if not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there being constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of public opinion, to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest, instead of warming, it should consume.",

Now, if you marry a foreigner, they don't get to live here.\n\n\nPutting myself in the shoes of the conservative members of the Supreme Court (aka evil, treasonous pieces of shit), step two would probably be getting rid of [Loving v. Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia) - bonus points because that precedent was used in support of gay marriage.\n\n\n> Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967), was a landmark civil rights decision of the U.S. Supreme Court which ruled that laws banning interracial marriage violate the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.[1][2] Beginning in 2013, the decision was cited as precedent in U.S. federal court decisions ruling that restrictions on same-sex marriage in the United States were unconstitutional, including in the Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges (2015).[3]\n\n\nAt that point, the racist, shithole states can just pass laws that make it illegal, and then yes, as you say in your comment, there will be ridiculous purity tests and all sorts of vile (and stupid!) fascist shit.\n\n\nWhat you are pointing out as the ridiculous part of this (that any given person probably has *some* percentage of \"non-white\" genes, whatever the hell that even means) is a feature, not a bug - that means the fascists can just apply this shit arbitrarily to go after whoever they want.

            "That\u2019s not what the case was about. Like at all.\n\nA US citizen married a citizen of El Salvador. During the visa application process an officer of the State Department declined the application citing a provision that the visa can be declined if the officer knew that the applicant was going to commit unlawful activity in the US. The officer never gave a reason or justification for using that provision. Just an \u201cI\u2019ve determined this so I\u2019m declining.\u201d They showed no proof or gave an actual reason.\n\nThey eventually just had to guess that because the applicant had MS-13 tattoos that this was the reason, but they don\u2019t really know. No actual reason was given. They couldn\u2019t argue that the decision was wrong because the State Dept never justified it in the first place.\n\nThe issue at stake is one of due process and the 5th amendment. Is the State Dept violating the rights of the spouse (not the applicant, but the rights of the  US citizen who is married to the applicant) by not allowing for due process? The applicant has no recourse to challenge the decision.\n\nWhich is actually fine for a non-citizen. But the argument at stake here is \u201cdoes the spouse have a right to due process?\u201d Should the spouse be able to challenge that decision? Is the marriage of a citizen something that the US government values and considers as a fundamental right for its citizens?\n\nBigger picture is marriage of a citizen an institution that US protects with the full force of the constitution?\n\nYou may think not. But that was the unsettled issue that was debated at the court. Th SC decided that marriage is not an institution that is protected by the constitution. They decided that you cannot use the constitution to protect your marriage.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t \u201chey I married this MS-13 gang member now he has full rights to come to the US and sell drugs and do some murdering.\u201d That was never at stake. It was \u201cYou denied my husband a visa. As an American citizen I should have the right to challenge that decision in court, and you should have to present evidence as to why.\u201d\n\nThe question was does protecting a marriage have constitutional weight?\n\nWhy does this matter? And how does it apply to same sex marriage in the US?\n\nFirst, there are countries in the world where same sex relations are punishable by prison sentences or even death.\n\nIf a US citizen marries someone of the same sex from one of those countries, it is now legal for a single officer at the State Dept to decline the visa without giving any justification. And there is no recourse for the US citizen married to that person to challenge the decision.\n\nSo it is now legally possible for the visa application to come in front of someone who works at the State Dept to just have the vibes that the applicant is a terrorist and deny the application. No justification is needed to deny it, just vibes. And the spouse has no recourse to challenge that decision in court. Which could in effect doom the applicant to whatever punishment awaits in their home country.\n\nAgain, no one is saying the applicant HAS to be allowed in the US. At no point in time did anyone in this case make that argument.\n\nThe question being decided was \u201cdoes not giving the US citizen a recourse to challenge the decision violate the citizens 5th amendment?\u201d\n\nWhat the decision does is weaken the argument that marriage is a fundamental institution protected by the constitution. It opens a crack in the door to challenge Obergefell. Which is what Sotomayor is calling out. She\u2019s very loudly saying \u201cI see what y\u2019all motherfuckers are up to.

And sometimes we just forget how things connect - the world is a complex system and it can be hard to keep track. \n\nMy favorite example is the time I tried to walk around the coastline of Point Defiance park in Tacoma, WA. The maps I looked at *seemed* to indicate you might be able to walk around the Point along the beach. I\u2019m a fairly smart person, but that was my first time spending any time near an ocean as an adult. I remember seeing a bulletin board with the tides posted and thinking \u201chuh, that\u2019s neat\u201d and walked by without checking it. \u2026 30 minutes later and the incoming tide had covered the beach and my options were: \n\n1) try to climb a blackberry bramble covered steep hillside, \n\n2) call emergency services and admit I was a dumbass, or \n\n3) take off my shoes, roll up my pants legs and wade back the way I came until the beach got big/wide enough that the tide hadn\u2019t covered it yet. \n\nI chose option 3 and learned an object lesson about tides I will never forget. Unfortunately, elections and politics is a topic that affects us all - so object lessons like that aren\u2019t really feasible\u2026 2016 was the last lesson, and for ages 18-21 they were 10-13yo when Trump was elected. That\u2019s a little young to pay much attention to politics. Heck they were 14-17 when the pandemic hit. Gen Z hasn\u2019t had a lot of functioning politics in their lives to see just how fucked up the last 8 years have been. Even the youngest millennials were 16 when Trump was elected.

Broadcast them through ads that'll reach the misinformed/uninformed.  He also needs to create ads detailing in broad, understandable, accurate terms, what a Trump presidency would mean to their wallets.\n\nIt's not impossible to convince some in the MAGA cult when you show how a tariffs will cost them big.  Hammer how the GOP is still trying to take away all women's reproductive rights.  Point out how bad the response to COVID was with Trumps denial of it's severity.

            "No, Biden has accomplishments he can talk up.  Here's some of them.\n\nAmerican Rescue Plan: The $1.9 trillion bill contained significant Covid-19 relief as the administration sought to combat the pandemic in 2021. It included $1,400 stimulus checks for most Americans, an expanded child tax credit that had a notable impact on child poverty rates, enhanced unemployment insurance, and state and local aid.  Most of the aid was sent to lower- and middle-class Americans, with little aid to the wealthy who didn\u2019t need the help.  It also included $37 billion of funding for helping disabled Americans and American seniors \u2013 this in spite of the stereotype of seniors being supporters of Republicans.  https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/4355386-biden-administration-announces-37b-in-funding-to-benefit-seniors-disabled-americans/ \n\nInfrastructure Bill: The $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill includes new funding for water pipes, trains, roads, and high-speed internet.  It includes $3.5 billion to upgrade American power infrastructure, protecting it from extreme weather and bringing renewable energy projects to reduce American dependence on foreign energy.  https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/the-us-just-made-its-biggest-ever-investment-in-the-grid?utm_id=115037&sfmc_id=4421411&skey_id=37459db0b811beac514b731eaa909ee0b7e90bff2b7183d6beabe65806527bc2  It also includes $42.5 billion to help more American get high-speed Internet, letting them do their own research into what\u2019s happening in the world instead of relying on big cable companies to give them access to accurate news channels: https://www.richmondfed.org/region_communities/regional_data_analysis/regional_matters/2022/rm_03_03_2022_broadband \n\nInvestment in American energy: Biden is spending $450 million dollars to develop green energy on American soil.  This helps America become less dependent on foreign oil.  https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-450-million-deploy-clean-energy-projects-mine-lands   \n\nInflation Reduction Act: The Inflation Reduction Act contained $485 billion in spending and $790 billion in offsets that would cover that spending. The legislation closed tax loopholes used by big companies, created jobs in clean energy and manufacturing, and allows Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices with the goal of lowering the costs of expensive drugs for ordinary Americans.  A significant number of the new jobs created by the Act are in states that are Republican: https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/04/17/georgia-evs-battery-belt/ \n\nCHIPS Act: The CHIPS Act devotes $52 billion to creating American jobs in semiconductor manufacturing, and contains measures to subsidize or expand new facilities to make jobs in America.  It also reduces America\u2019s dependence on foreign chip manufacturers.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIPS_and_Science_Act \n\nRailway worker paid sick leave: Biden successfully helped American railway unions get paid sick leave: https://www.ibew.org/media-center/Articles/23Daily/2306/230620_IBEWandPaid. \n\nSocial Security: Biden successfully used Republican attempts to heckle him to make a live, unscripted response to got them to publicly commit to not cutting Social Security and Medicare.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErfL3Vfzzkw \n\nPolice body cams: Biden required all federal law enforcement agents to wear body cams.  This helps preserve evidence of crimes, and makes it harder to hide attempts by law enforcement officers to illegally use their authority against ordinary citizens.  https://www.govexec.com/management/2022/05/biden-orders-all-federal-law-enforcement-wear-body-cameras/367381/ \n\nStudent loan forgiveness: Biden has provided student debt relief of almost $132 billion to 3.6 million borrowers.  Now instead of that money going to line the pockets of the corporate lender elite, American workers can now use that money on local businesses and the economy.   https://www.axios.com/2023/12/16/student-loan-forgiveness-where-it-stands\n\nWages: In February 2024, available jobs and wages under Biden both went up.  https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-job-growth-surges-january-wages-rise-2024-02-02/",

As it implements CHIPS, the Department of Commerce has been in close touch with a number of partners and allies including the Republic of Korea, Japan, the United Kingdom, India, and the European Union. The United States is engaging with partners and allies to coordinate government incentive programs, build resilient cross-border semiconductor supply chains, promote knowledge exchange and collaboration in developing next-generation technologies, and implement safeguards to protect national security.\nCommunity colleges across the nation are implementing semi conductor manufacturing programs because it\u2019s a big demand.  \n\nThe IRA is huge deal in creating \nopportunities to build projects, hire workers, and manufacture equipment needed to strengthen domestic supply chains, lower household energy costs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and pay good wages for those efforts. In this all-of-government effort, the U.S. Department of the Treasury is responsible for implementing major elements of the law, including tax incentives that spur investment in clean energy and manufacturing and that lower healthcare costs (prescription drug costs capped), corporate tax code reforms that enhance economic fairness, and Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) efforts to dramatically improve customer service, modernize technology, and ensure the wealthy and large corporations pay the taxes they legally owe.  Which they have already gone after and received 465 mil from rich who owed taxes fighting to get out from paying them.  \n\nInfrastructure Act \n\nDeliver clean water to all American families and eliminate the nation\u2019s lead service lines. \n\nEnsure every American has access to reliable high-speed internet. Vast majority is to rural areas. Who predominately lives in rural areas?  Conservatives.  Biden is doing things for all Americans.  Trumps perceived enemies are half of Americans and our Allies.  And his buddies are dictators.  \n\nRepair and rebuild our roads and bridges with a focus on climate change mitigation, resilience, equity, and safety for all users.\n\nImprove transportation options for millions of Americans and reduce greenhouse emissions through the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history.\n\nUpgrade our nation\u2019s airports and ports to strengthen our supply chains and prevent disruptions that have caused inflation. This will improve U.S. competitiveness, create more and better jobs at these hubs, and reduce emissions.\n\nMake the largest investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak\n\nBuild a national network of electric vehicle (EV) chargers\n\nUpgrade our power infrastructure to deliver clean, reliable energy across the country and deploy cutting-edge energy technology to achieve a zero-emissions future.\n\nMake our infrastructure resilient against the impacts of climate change, cyber-attacks, and extreme weather events\n\nDeliver the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells\n\nHe passes the big Gun Safety Bill \n\nThe Pact Act. He takes care of our veterans. \n Let\u2019s not forget that gop voted against all of this.   All of it, voted against.  \n\nHe would have had the most comprehensive immigration bill that pleased many conservatives until Trump said \u201cno I want to run on the border.  It\u2019s all I\u2019ve got\u201d. Trump killed border security bill.  \nShould I continue?   I can.

But the guy was a winning general and had massive respect all over the board (he was courted by both dems and conservative for the nomination) The voters liked the guy. \u00a0Simple as that. That was enough. \u00a0And the slogan rolled off the tongue. Second campaign ? \u201cI still like Ike. \u201c they didn\u2019t even bother about catchiness anymore. the voters \u00a0just liked the guy.\u00a0\n\nFast forward \u00a0to Hillary Clinton : \u201cI am with her\u201d. \u00a0Clinton wasn\u2019t Eiseinowher. Far from it. \u00a0If anything many people voted for Trump because they couldn\u2019t stand her. \u00a0Doesn\u2019t matter if they were right or wrong about it - that\u2019s just how they felt.

But a lot of political consultant are involved in this on both sides and they still \u00a0get it wrong sometimes. I get why you\u2019re not convinced about \u201ceven worse than before\u201d. \u00a0But it builds on something already in everyone\u2019s head. Everyone knows about Trumps antics. He keeps doing shit that infuriates Liberals and make even some conservative cringe. Like even some are like \u201ccould you SFU ?\u201d. So it builds on that. I find \u201cthe worst is yet to come\u201d actually interesting. \u00a0But one could argue it\u2019s even more vague and you could say about any opponent : he\u2019s bad now but it will be worse if you give him power. \u00a0\u201cTrump is cancer\u201d \u00a0feels impersonal. Why cancer ? Why not rot ? Or plague ? \u00a0But maybe he does something that makes people THINK of cancer and suddenly \u00a0it\u2019s a winner.\u00a0\nThe point is : it \u00a0needs to feel organic/obvious as the truth itself.

            ">All grist for a mill that's not turning. That's what believers keep shouting down the well.\u00a0\n\nI believe you'll find that people are in fact noticing the differences in the outcomes of Biden's policies compared to Trump's policies.  Here's one example from just today: [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/21/trump-biden-agriculture-policies](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/21/trump-biden-agriculture-policies)\n\n>What the world sees, what the people you need but can't get to vote for him see is a person in serious, accelerating decline who will not make it through a next term. He's even worse than before.\n\nI think you're forgetting about Biden's 2024 State of the Union, where he stood in front of live cameras for several hours doing just fine.  Here's a recording if you need a refresher: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V01QvlQels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V01QvlQels)\u00a0 \n\nThat's not just a one-off event - Biden has a long history of showing no signs of dementia in public appearances.\n\nHere\u2019s one speech from November 29, 2023: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZLfX89rqOw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZLfX89rqOw)\n\nIn February 2024, Biden did a televised interview without any issues: [https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-makes-surprise-appearance-late-night-seth-meyers-rcna140604](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-makes-surprise-appearance-late-night-seth-meyers-rcna140604)\n\nDuring a speech in February 2023, Biden got Republicans to publicly agree to not cut Social Security and Medicare: [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/08/state-of-the-union-brings-brief-unanimity-on-social-security-medicare.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/08/state-of-the-union-brings-brief-unanimity-on-social-security-medicare.html).\u00a0 This was after some Republicans were calling for cuts to those programs: [https://time.com/6254832/republicans-sunset-social-security-medicare/](https://time.com/6254832/republicans-sunset-social-security-medicare/) How could he have baited Republicans like that in real time if he was really suffering from mental problems?\u00a0 The only explanation is that he has good mental speed and agility.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s a recording of a livestreamed speech from early May 2024: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr9aLbPTb8k&t=100s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr9aLbPTb8k&t=100s)\u00a0\n\nRepublicans know that Biden is showing everyone that he's just fine, and that scares them enough that they've turned to using videos that are edited to make Biden look bad.  Here's one example: [https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/biden-g7-video-conservative-media-uses-misleading-camera-angle-rcna157112](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/biden-g7-video-conservative-media-uses-misleading-camera-angle-rcna157112)\n\n(continued below)",

            "If you want a real example of someone declining, you can look at the other choice for president, Trump.\n\nTrump was recently involved in a sexual assault case, where journalist Elizabeth Carroll said Trump sexually assaulted her.\u00a0 Here is a video of Trump being shown a picture of Carroll, and he was unable to identify her and thought she was his wife.\u00a0 Trump was later found liable by a jury and was ordered to pay damages.\u00a0 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjTtihu9yLQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjTtihu9yLQ)\n\nTrump claimed that during the American Revolutionary War, the US Revolutionary Army captured airports: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mZ1ofj2Vo.\u00a0 The first aircraft in the world to take flight would do so in 1903, over a hundred years after the Revolutionary War.\n\nTrump says that kidneys are in the heart: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx\\_a4z0I878](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx_a4z0I878)\u00a0\n\nI was able to find a transcript of a Trump speech from early May 2024, with video: [https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/slIweEUXlojmb24NRTdgHk\\_yqcdxKOMUKUQ381yMC5NRro3cme5okRYBJasDztPNZ2GwkvsQ-\\_dqNsZDWkWBIvqKsBs?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=159.24](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/slIweEUXlojmb24NRTdgHk_yqcdxKOMUKUQ381yMC5NRro3cme5okRYBJasDztPNZ2GwkvsQ-_dqNsZDWkWBIvqKsBs?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=159.24)\u00a0\n\nAt 6:05, Trump claimed that the GDP under Biden was falling, when it\u2019s actually going up: https://www.bea.gov/news/2024/gross-domestic-product-first-quarter-2024-advance-estimate.\u00a0\n\nAt 6:16, he says \u201cAnd we're in stagflation right now. Congratulations everybody. \u00a0It spells the death of the American dream, and that doesn't even include some of the horrible numbers that we're seeing flowing in from the poor and crime-ridden countries all over the world. They have people flowing in from the poorest and the heaviest crime countries all over the world.\u201d\u00a0 Those topics don\u2019t flow logically \u2013 how did he go from talking about inflation to immigration, when those topics aren\u2019t related?\u00a0 Maybe he heard himself talking about other countries and then his mind jumped to the old favorite topic of immigration, forgetting that he was talking about inflation.\u00a0\n\nAt 7:07, Trump claims that Biden wants tax cuts passed under Trump to end.\u00a0 Trump has forgotten that he was the one who wanted those tax cuts to expire in the first place: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/18/trump-tcja-tax-cuts-are-slated-to-expire-after-next-year.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/18/trump-tcja-tax-cuts-are-slated-to-expire-after-next-year.html)\n\nAt 9:08, Trump suddenly jumps from tax cuts to talking about a random person in the audience.\u00a0 \u201cYet crooked Joe Biden wants to raise taxes on top of that and raise business taxes, which will lead to the destruction of your jobs and, you know what, ultimately it's just going to lead to the destruction of the country. We have so many negative forces on this country. Uncle Sam is right here. Look at him. You are perfect. These guy's are the best. He's like a perfect Uncle Sam.\u201d\u00a0 How did Trump forget about he was talking about so suddenly?\u00a0 His memory really does seem to be going.\u00a0\n\nThis is just from the first ten minutes of his speech.\u00a0\u00a0Trump is just not mentally doing well.",
            "He avoided war by giving hostile powers what they wanted in exchange for nothing. We gave up bases in the Middle East to the Russians, betrayed pirate Kurd allies and left them to die, and surrendered Afghanistan to the Taliban, guaranteeing them we would pull out before we had logistics in place to do so.\n\nHe didn't want to take steps to address COVID because he figured it would kill more people in cities than rural communities, and he lost bigly in urban districts.\n\nHis tax cuts reversed a decreasing trend in the deficit from the Obama years.\n\nHis economic policies intentionally suppressed increases to interest rates post-2008 recession recovery, stripping the Federal Reserve of an important lever they would need to control inflation if there a threat to the economy in the future, say, a global pandemic that shut down entire swathes of economic sectors. His trade war with China increased supply costs across dozens of industries and yielded little benefit. He negotiated a deal with OPEC during lockdown where Russia and Saudi Arabia would reduce production to bolster gas prices in an effort to keep American oil companies afloat, but the agreement also kept production low after lockdowns lifted, leading to the increase in gas prices that people blamed Biden for. Embargos on Russian oil imports in the wake of the Ukraine invasion also contributed to increased gas prices.\n\nEven if he wasn't a morally bankrupt conman with detestable social policies, as a president, his foreign policy is weak and undermines our global influence, his health policy is pro-death instead of pro-American, his fiscal policies are a never-ending cavalcade of botches and bundles. He constantly own-goals himself in almost every endeavor he undertakes, but daddy's money has enabled him to fail upward almost every time. The biggest roadblock he faced last presidency wasn't a radical leftist deep state; it was his own incompetence.\n\nHe wants to rule, but he can't govern. The only thing he is good at is peddling hate and lies. He is a metastitized cancer in politics that is the result of the reactionary alt-right huffing bigoted hate for decades. He is a tumor that is sucking all the life of the Republican Party into himself, and my hope is that enough of America sees him for what he truly is and reject him and the ones puckered up to his sphincter this November. Republicans refuse to cut out the cancer at the core of their platform, and I hope their ideology withers and dies from it.",

            "Pack the courts, law professors have been saying for years he's well within his powers to do it.  Its been done before.  The President does not need Senatorial approval to put someone on the SC.\n\nIt's like Obama not installing Garland when McConnell refused to bring the nomination up.  Submitting the nomination before the Senate was just a polite formality and he could've just ignored them.",

So, not the situation Biden has.",

If you follow that list of policies, you are instituting project 2025. \n\nIt's put together by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative group that funds a lot of conservative projects. \n\nPutting those policies into place gives the president absolute power, effectively making them a dictator for life.\n\nThat's the long and short of it. I'm not going to sit here and explain the entire thing to someone who refuses to read. Have a nice day.",

            "Oddly enough I think a ruling against total immunity handed down before the election would be a minor win for Trump exclusively among those undecided non-MAGA conservatives (those traditional Republicans that MAGA call RINOs).  No total immunity means one less big concern that might otherwise cause them to abstain (as it's doubtful any of them would smash the like button for Biden).  I live in a moderately sized southern city with surprisingly little MAGA influence (tons of folks applaud Kemp and Raff for opposing Trump's requests) and I have heard from several folks that they won't vote for Trump out of a concern for what he'd do if he got total immunity.  Obviously, a decision in favor of total immunity before the election (which I don't expect) would only amplify the danger of a second Trump term, igniting the fire under the MAGAdingdongs and turning off a lot of those same sort of conservatives.  Withholding a decision until after the election means those same folks might consider their vote a gamble on total immunity, or even a losing vote if they believe Trump would pressure SCOTUS for his desired outcome.  The only good outcome is the one that every side should have acknowledged a long time ago, which is that there isn't total immunity.  But alas...",

If Egypt was fabricated as the enslaver of the Hebrews, then it was far more likely done in an attempt to borrow from Egypts percieved legitimacy as a well-established cultural power in the region.\n\n\nThe Hebrews were likely henotheistic at the time of the babylonian exile, acknowledging the existence of other gods but having a single patron god that was considered the most important and relevant for them. The move to hard monotheism can be attributed largely to Zoroastrian influence during the period of Persian rule (this is likely also the source of hebrew messianic concepts).
