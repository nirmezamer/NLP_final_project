Do some schools really allow in-campus access to students on holidays, and are libraries even open? She also had to go to school as her professor instructed on June 17, which is a holiday also. Do some schools really allow this? Is this incompetence on their part? Or am I just lucky enough to be in a decent school and not in low-end schools like MMC?",

A wearable band or pendant where an elderly can quickly trigger an SOS call and also have someone automatically check on them if the device detects a fall.\n\nI have a relative who is currently using a Galaxy watch hoping the fall detection would work properly and automatically call the emergency contact, they recently had a fall, and fall detection/SOS didn't trigger because they needed to stay still for a minute before it triggered. They were still conscious, so it didn't trigger.\n\nThey also have problems manually triggering the SOS function because you need to click the power button 3 times in quick succession, they can't press it quick enough to trigger the SOS call.\n\nApple Watch is not an option, it's too expensive and it will likely have the same issues as the Galaxy Watch regarding having them trigger the SOS. It needs to be a simple button for them to trigger.\n\nDoes anyone here have experience using such devices/services? Thanks!",

All our family's past helpers before would eat what we did, however our helper now seems picky with food - i.e. she\u2019s from the province so shes used to fish + veggies so she won't eat the food I make (chicken meatballs + veggies, chicken curry, etc). She actually just seems moody, like she said she rarely eats chicken and meat but then preferred to prepare fried chicken and lumpiang shanghai for herself once. She's not used to eating leftovers, so sometimes that's what my husband and I would have, while I'll let her prepare her own food. We went to the grocery to buy her a bunch of stuff (pancit canton, canned goods, since we don't eat these and so she has stock) and we buy fish for her from the market. I don't want to keep thinking about her meals on a daily basis though, also because I know me and my partner can be too nice and we don't want to get taken advantage of. I was told to give her a food allowance-- not sure exactly how this works. Any tips / suggestions? Thank you!",

All of which I bought from him.\n\nI'm aware on how dermatologists would repackage certain lotions and creams so I wasnt all too surprised when I found what I bought was marked up and in different packaging from what can be bought in stores like Watsons.\n\nWhat did surprise me though was that one of the tablets he prescribed was in a... sketchy packaging to say the least. Here's a photo:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/27IyCuH\n\nThe other tablet he prescribed was Fexofenadine, which I know is an antihistamine based on the packaging. The one in the photo, S-ACTV 5mg, just seems so sketchy tho. I cant seem to find anything specific for S-ACTV but did find something called ACTV 24 sold under Bilastine, another antihistamine. However, it's sold at 20mg, not 5mg.\n\nIs it normal for dermatologists to sell it like this, without proper packaging? Anyone else heard of this S-ACTV?",

I have a Shopee store (na ititigil ko na since required na iregister sa BIR and magkakawork na ako so I'll have no time to do the taxes and fulfill orders.)  that performs well with good sales, but the catch is hindi pa ito registered sa BIR since ginawa ko lang sideline habang nagrereview ako for boards para may source of funds parin ako without depending on anyone.

And would simply not give them any benefit other than a suicide on its economy that would lead to uprising. \n\nAlso alot of people over estimating china's military prowess even if china does really want to invade us they simply don't have the logistics and capability to do an amphibious landing to a country hundreds of miles away would be very difficult task.\n\nOn a hypothetical scenario if a war does really broke out against all logic most of the battles will be at sea and it will be fought with fighter jets, drones, ships, long range missiles and subs. So unless pilot ka or you have useful skills that may be in use in the navy the majority of volunteers Ain't gonna do shit walang masyadong engagements sa infantry katulad ng ukraine, ang magagawa mo manuod nalang sa social media ng updates.\n\nChinese military is not on par yet with the united states even if they claim be, its all talk shit just like russia they know this and that's why they are frustrated and lash out their desperation and frustration to our coastguard. \n\nAlso alot of people say america would ditch the Philippines in case of a blown out war. Well america will definitely defend the Philippines but not because they are doing it out of the kindness of their hearts but its necessary for their national interest, they will be forced to defend us wether they like it or not. Not honoring the MDT would simply be a disastrous for america and its allies around the world and would mean an end for US hegemony.\n\nSo in summary china will not wage a full scale war on us but the harrassment and bullying will continue to escalate in WPS their main goal is to exhaust and intimidate the Philippines coastguard and navy.\n\n So we better buckle up cause were in for a long haul.",

This is, however, not discounting how messy a shift of power is. Still, an all out war is the last thing in China\u2019s mind in my opinion.",
            "A lot of people are folding because they see the number of China\u2019s boats and let me tell you, it\u2019s not the number of equipment you have that makes a military strong. You can look at the US and see it is not their number that makes them the best military in the world. I watched the video of the harassment and it\u2019s just laughable. The Chinese needs their 20 people to be armed even with their better boats to deal with 8 Pinoys. This means they need 3x the advantage to deal with us. This only shows they\u2019re more afraid of us and their strength is just for show when they couldn\u2019t even use their tech advantage properly. Also see that their people are in life jackets like babies while ours are in fatigues. Mas malusog pa nasa Sierra Madre kesa dun sa Chinese. No wonder our troops show no fear in their stance and voice; they\u2019re like staring at a shi tzu barking. \n\nAlso a lot don\u2019t understand the Mainlander mindset. Due to the one child policy, the soldiers they have today are the unico hijos of their families. Kill one Chinese soldier, wipe two bloodlines. Also because of the shit their government puts them through, they trust no one but themselves. Because of their scamming culture, they do not trust their own people\u2019s work (their equipment). Their morale is very easy to break and if you break them, they\u2019ll all fold quickly. And with how misogynistic they are and their women being physical weaklings, it\u2019s very easy to make their whole country fold. \n\nSo tatagan lang loob natin.

Still, we should not be over reliant to them when it comes to defense and armed units, sana lang the PH governments of today and the future would continue to upgrade militarily but still diplomatically deal with the issue.\n\nI also think the the 1991 decision of the philippine senate to kick out the US naval base in subic is a major mistake, it would have been a deterrent nowadays.",

Taiwan's semiconductor industry is vital to global technology, and the U.S. cannot afford to let China gain control over such a crucial sector. This would be perceived as a strategic threat, prompting the U.S. to take decisive military action to prevent a repeat of the Ukraine-Russia conflict, where geopolitical balance was significantly altered.\n\nOn the other hand, if China were to declare war on the Philippines, the U.S. response might differ. Given the existing defense treaties and strategic interests in the South China Sea, the U.S. would likely support the Philippines through a proxy war. This would involve providing military aid, intelligence, and other forms of indirect support to counter Chinese aggression without direct confrontation. This approach would aim to contain China\u2019s expansion while minimizing the risk of a larger, direct conflict.\n\nAnd this is a neutral opinion of mine.",

But if we shoot their axe-wielding soldiers, China will still act, even if it's not an overreaction. China would probably board BRP Sierra Madre and kick out the Philippine Marine detachment there. China would also probably start occupying Panatag Shoal and begin a reclamation project there. And if the US wouldn't come to our rescue despite BRP Sierra Madre still being a commissioned naval vessel of the Philippines under the protection of MDT, China would proceed occupying Ayungin Shoal as well and begin a reclamation project there. This is an attempt of China to gauge how much willing the US is to defend the Philippines, and sadly personally, I think if China begins occupying Ayungin and Panatag Shoals, due to the Philippines firing the first shot, the US won't help us at all. The US won't care about some shoals and a decrepit grounded ship for the invocation of MDT.\n\nFortunately, even if the scenario I stated plays out, there's still a hope for the Philippines. And that hope is to escalate as well. If China begins occupying Ayungin and Panatag, then send everything we got. Shoot at them and bomb them. But China will also respond in kind, and in greater force. It's basically a suicide mission for any naval and marine unit we send there. But this is the kind of escalation we need.

A focused program designed to find the best people is better than forcing a million students to participate, and most would never be taught to wage war properly.\n\nEven under conscriptions, plenty of countries put up some exemptions, eligibilities, and lottery.  They don't need to put every single 18 year old in to service.",
            "makes sense if thats what you prefer and may option go for it. i think we all agree yung implementation ng rotc talaga ang problem bec madaming abusado sa atin. those in ppwer cant be trusted more often than not. abusado saka di nahihiya or walang sense of the need to adhere to right way of being."
