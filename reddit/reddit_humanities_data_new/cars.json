            "I\u2019m in North Texas, doing a lot of driving. \n\nI don\u2019t haul stuff but it would be my daily driver. I\u2019d prefer automatic. I\u2019m looking at used mustangs but really am pretty I knowledgeable when it comes to years and stuff. I want a V8 before they go the way of the dodo. \n\nUltimately what I want in a car is something enjoyable to drive on American highways, not too big for city driving, and is something that won\u2019t be in the shop all the time due to issues. The mustang is interesting to me due to being able to get some higher trims used with under 30k miles for around 30k. Im just wondering what my options are if I want to stay under 35k but have a car that will be fun and last me 7 years or so.",

            "Hello everyone! I am finally in the market for my first car, and I'd love some advice from more experienced drivers. \n\nSo, it will be my first ride, and my budget is pretty low. However, I'd really love some fun quirky car with a character, you know. I really love the looks of Corvettes C3 & C4, and just classic 70s or 80s convertibles like MGM or Midget**,** Alfa Romeo Spider, or something cool with pop-up headlights. \n\nSince the budget is so low, I see two options. Either purchase a more modern and relatively reliable car and pray to god it won't break because I won't be able to fix it. Or maybe find an older car (even if it's slightly pricier) in hopes that fixing it will be easier since there are fewer electronics and complicated stuff.    \n  \nHowever, I've never dealt with fixing and assembling cars. I am willing to do the repairs, which can be done with YouTube, but smth like disassembling the engine would be way out of my skill set.   \n  \nLast but not least, since the initial budget is low, the insurance, gas, and future repairs are also something I'm trying to be mindful of.  \n  \n**Location:**\u00a0Los Angeles, California  \n**Price range:**\u00a0$3500, ideally around $2500-3000  \n**Lease or Buy:** Buy  \n**New or used:** Used  \n**Type:**\u00a0Convertable or Coupe   \n**Must haves:**\u00a0Being able to be a daily driver, would love airbags too  \n**Desired transmission:** Prefer auto, but can go manual  \n**Intended use:**\u00a0Daily Driver  \n**Vehicles I've already considered:** Corvettes, Mustang, MG Midget, Miata  \n**Is this your 1st vehicle:** Yes  \n**Minor vehicle work:**\u00a0Probably  \n**Major vehicle work:**\u00a0Doubt it",

The basic gist is there are two things at play, water/dirt/dust gets kicked up by the car, and clean air flows over the top of the car until it seperates from the body at the rear. Everything that gets kicked up doesn\u2019t go any higher than this separation point as then it just gets blown backwards. \n\nThis creates a \u2018pocket\u2019 of air behind the car where everything that gets kicked up sits and dirties the rear of the car. On sedans/coupes/trucks this seperation point is the top of the trunk lid (or tailgate), while on hatches/wagons/SUVs/vans this is the top of the roof, which means the rear window gets caked in whatever gets kicked up. \n\nNot really an issue in dry weather but in the rain or on unsealed roads the back window will get covered just with the car moving, which isn\u2019t an issue on sedans or the like as the back window only really gets wet if the car is stationary or moving slowly.\n\nI\u2019ve been in several situations with my wagons where it\u2019s not actively raining and I\u2019m not running the front wipers but there\u2019s enough water on the road that I\u2019ve got the rear wipers going full tilt to clear the spray.\n\nOlder wagons and SUVs used to occasionally feature scoops [on the top](https://i.imgur.com/Ui51h8K.jpeg) or [sides](https://i.imgur.com/GkwjpOb.jpeg) of the rear window to capture clean air going past the car and dump it across the window to keep it clean, but this isn\u2019t done anymore because of the aerodynamic penalties.",

            "The hybrid and EV comparison with an ICE always make me chuckle. Annual savings on fuel is not linear as gas mileage goes up. Sure, a 41mpg hybrid will save money at the gas pump compared to a non-hybrid but its like 7 years to save $1,500 compared to 30mpg. So if you do not keep a car long enough to meet that break even point then you actually lost money. EV's are a whole different story due to how the government misrepresents MPGe. EVs get a 6.67 correction factor for the amount of energy in a gallon of gasoline when converting to equivalent fuel economy.

Your pocket book wont see that though due to a lack of road taxes and the cheaper cost of electricity (Thanks to heavy regulation in price fluctuations). If your state imposes a road tax for owning a EV (they all will eventually) then the savings will be effected. Add in the higher cost for insurance and higher vehicle license tax due to the higher initial vehicle value (The $7k rebate doesn't reduce this) and it might actually cost more to own an EV. Anyway, 30-35mpg is the sweet spot for cost of ownership on a vehicle.",

If I know the technology wasn't viable for the timeline then all the people smarter than me and that have all the information have to know as well.\n\nThe cynic in me says they want to mandate this and brainwash everyone into believing it. Then when the deadline comes and we don't have the supply chain, resources or infrastructure to build or (green) charge them the authorities can say \"well we don't have enough cars to go around and couldn't support the required number anyways; I guess less people will be driving cars in the future.\"\n\nThe optimist in me says that the hysteria will end and eventually people will come to their senses. Hybrid platforms of diesel over electric to start, and eventually something greener like H-fuel cell or E-fuel hybrids will become the long range options. I am a heavy duty mechanic and I KNOW the heavy haul industry cannot function via EVs.\n\nFord announced the Lightning and said the extended range version would have 300mi range, but touted the number as low because the EPA said they had to test with 1000lbs payload as it is considered a work truck, so the range is more like 350 miles.\n\nThe VERY first thing I said was hang on... if it GAINS 50 miles from dropping 1000lbs, how much does it lose towing anything it is rated for? Say 6000 lbs? Wind resistance from the trailer or boat?\n\nYeah so anyway here we are last weekend and I fuelled up my truck at a relatively remote fuel station. Here is a family in a lightning towing a travel trailer smaller than mine parked blocking a bunch of charging stations.\n\nI politely ask \"I've never spoken to anyone who has actually towed with one of these.. how is it?\" The response was \"when towing our trailer the range drops to between 200 and 250km.\" I asked how long it takes to charge from, say 15%. They said \"we are at 12% now and it should take around an hour to get back to 80% - not that bad really. However we don't have service and can't get the charging station to work.\"\n\nSo BEST CASE SCENARIO they can go a less than a third the distance my diesel truck will go towing a smaller trailer to then wait AN HOUR with the family blocking a bunch of charging stations in a sweltering parking lot in the middle of nowhere to NOT CHARGE IT FULLY. I can refill my truck in 10 minutes and drive another 600km plus I can pack extra fuel if need be.\n\nHOWEVER their situation was not best case scenario. They couldn't even charge at all because of electronic complications and didn't have the range to leave and find service elsewhere.\n\nYeah. EVs are not the future.
