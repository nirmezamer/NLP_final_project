($100 AUD = $67 USD).\n\nLatest MB's will take say 7000 MHz RAM and M.2 PCIe-v5 slots, or two previous gen MB's would have 6000 Mhz and M.2 PCIe-v4, earlier than that would be 5000 MHz and M.2 PCIe-v3. People want the latest and fastest gear all round anyway.\n\nTo summarize: You're pretty much always upgrading combo's consisting of MB+CPU pairs anyway.

It was never designed for 400W+ expansion cards or the huge radiators needed to cool modern top-end CPUs, forcing case manufacturers to invent exotic solutions and customers to spend time re-checking minor but critical things like RAM clearance, radiator compatibility, GPU length etc.\n\nBut any new effort at resolving all those issues will inevitably run against 40-year inertia, so people have stopped trying. Way too many parties have to play ball for it to work.",
            "You mean the company that paid PC manufacturers not to sell AMD-based systems? You must be joking. Intel is more than happy to engage in anti-competitive behavior as long as they think they can get away with it.",

            "I\u2019m not sure Lunar Lake E cores will underperform Zen 5c at all, at least not in the Strix Point iteration. Check out Dave\u2019s latency numbers. 170ns to communicate between cores in different clusters. Zen 5 launch is beginning to feel like a disaster",
            "Wym zen5c ipc is closer to Lion cove",
            "In consumer chips, Intel P and E cores do run the same instructions right? Instructions like AVX512 are disabled on the P cores for this reason.",
            "Instruction set is exactly the same in p and e cores.",
            "LNC doesn't support SMT at all. So no SMT for ARL either.",
            "But that doesn't matter for Zen5 and Zen5c IPC. In the tests both Zen5 and Zen5c IPC is measured. These IPCs per core wont change.",
            "To be fair, mobile Zen 4 chips are also limited to max 5.1GHz boost clocks for power reasons.",
            "Wonder why he didn\u2019t do floating point spec test aswell.",
            "The regular cores use the same architecture.",
            "Huang has mentioned Zen5c can go \\~4Ghz. A phoronix test with the 8500g locked the Zen4c cores at 3.7Ghz from 3.2. It would be interesting to see the tests again if he can get Zen5c clocked close to \\~4Ghz limit he mentioned.",
            "bro thats literally what im saying why am i being downvoted for agreeing \ud83d\udc80.",
            "Zen 4 IPC was behind Raptor Cove by up to 10% even though it is more efficient. Something that looks like it won\u2019t change much (except AVX512) looking at claimed IPC of Lion Cove vs Zen 5.\n\nZen5C will have mostly same IPC (the smaller cache will introduce some regressions) as Zen5.\n\nZen 5 P core unlike rumored for Arrowlake, will maintain same clocks. So advantage moves to AMD there.\n\nZen 5C slightly overcomes this IPC and looking at it again, it actually may have a 3-5% advantage over skymont geomean",
            "He said SPEC takes too long and the CPU was already throttling on SPECInt single thread. The laptop was on loan.",
            "What about this? https://imgur.com/a/dnLBUff",
            "He didn't say it can go 4GHz, he says less than 4GHz. In this case, the 5c tops out at 3.3GHz",
            "Though we were talking about integer(since that\u2019s what intel used to measure ipc vs raptor cove) in specint because zen 4 and raptor cove have the same ipc there.",
            "Lock cpu to lower clockspeed, as long as it\u2019s iso \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",
            "Interesting, I missed that information. Where is that from? That would change IPC in vector workloads. So depending on the workload, if it can levarage that advantage, there might be some IPC differences. But tbh I haven't heard of the Youth Edition 'till now.",
            "I suppose you mean something like [this](https://x.com/InstLatX64/status/1800132652651159643). Same uArch but different packaging for mobile. On the surface, with mobile SKUs there always was a halving of the L3 cache, and of course it is monolithic. IPC may differ a little, but it's more single threaded uplift because of higher clocks for desktop.",
            "I think \u201cZen5 Youth\u201d here is Zen 5c (cut down version of Zen5 core). Its IPC was also measured in the table. Worse than Zen4.",

            "You made a false statement saying zen 5c has raptor cove ipc level but your wrong it\u2019s higher than raptor cove in integer which is way more important than floating foint",

            "This is what [he is referring to](https://x.com/GPUsAreMagic/status/1797770939176034597). CCX0 is Zen5 with access to 16MB L3. While CCX1, Zen5c has access to its 8MB of cache.

            "Ok, a cut down version for mobile then. But this is comparing Zen5 mobile to Zen4 mobile. Not sure if Zen4 mobile also had similar cut compared to Desktop version.",
            "Edit: Ok, by how much and based on what am I wrong",
            "That doesn\u2019t match what he said. Also zen 5 vanilla only mobile has 16 mb of cache for 4 cpu cores it has the same amount of cache per core as zen 5 desktop,",
            "He said compared to zen 5 desktop/server zen 5 mobile is cut down",
