            "Still in my latest New Vegas run. Not sure if I should make a post.",
            "After finishing **Half Life**, **Half Life 2** and **Half Life 2: Episode 1**, I'm playing **Half Life 2: Episode 2** now. Half Life 2 looks like a tech showcase, while Episode 1 and specially Episode 2 look like a proper game. Everything is the same, but better and more fleshed out. In Half Life 2 it feels like Valve spent too much time and resources trying to innovate and weren't able to put a game together. Episode 2 is almost embarrassing, because it shows how disjointed and bad Half Life 2 actually is. So yeah, I like episode 2. I wish it was even weirder. The telekinetic alien in the barn? I wanted more of that. I also grew fond of Alyx in Episode 2. Is she the proto AI companion? I can see Ellie and Elizabeth in her.\n\n\nI also started playing **Slay the Spire** again. I liked the game the first time, but got burned out on how difficult it is. Now I think it finally clicked for me and I'm addicted to it. I'm still bad though. lol \"Finished\" the game with the first three characters, but still haven't beat the heart.",
            "I wrapped up the story in **Alien: Isolation** and the last few achievements as well. Still a solid game after nearly 10 years. It's amazing that Creative Assembly was able to make such an incredible AAA survival horror game after making primarily strategy games for most of their history.\n\nI continued playing through **Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners** as well and I finished the story after leaving the game dormant for 2 years. I'm now enjoying the Aftershock DLC and grabbing achievements as well which are surprisingly fun as they force me to grab certain materials or find certain weapons to complete them.\n\nI also started playing **Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy** yesterday and I'm shocked at how good this has been so far. I'm only two hours in but they're really nailing the tone, atmosphere and humor of the movies. Which is great because those films are probably my favorite from the MCU. I'm also glad because this game didn't go the route of Marvel's Avenger with the whole live service shit show it followed.",
            "I completed **Tunic** and **Sifu** this month. Both very satisfying games in very different ways. \n\n**Tunic** is the first game in a long time that made me actually break out the pen and paper, and I really appreciate it for that. The final puzzle is one of my favorite puzzles I have ever completed in a game. \n\nI also really like the boss fights. I know it\u2019s combat is a bit divisive, especially given how much harder than the rest of the game they are, but I really enjoyed them, especially the final boss. \n\n**Sifu** on the other hand is just pure flow state combat. The closest a game has come to feeling like John Wick.\n\nThen, like half of everyone else, I started **Shadow of the Erdtree** last night. It\u2019s bigger and harder than I expected, but that\u2019s a plus for me.",
            "I'm trying to play Mass Effect and there are moments when I can see what's great about it, but as wide as the game world is, it's so shallow...! yes you can go to so many planets, but each has the same underground base, all pickups are just weapons, all the collectables feel are just a journal entry. I hope I can get to ME2, but that will probably mean I just run through the story stuff and skip the skippable stuff.",
            "I beat SMT IV earlier this month, I started on 02/25/2024 then ended on 06/06/2024. I enjoyed my run a lot overall. In the beginning it felt slow but glad I stuck with it. I am playing the game again, >!I believe this isn\u2019t a spoiler but there is multiple endings so I did the Law route and now want to do Chaos through New Game Plus.!<\n\n>!I\u2019ve finally made it out of Naraku again earlier today!<",
            "Playing Mega Man 3. Only Needle Man remains to be defeated. Pretty good game. The weaknesses are less broken, so the boss battles are still challenging while using them, which fixes what I think is the main problem of 1 and 2.",
            "I\u2019m finishing up Prey for the first time, and it\u2019s great!\n\nNow I\u2019m looking for a palate cleanser \u2014 a really good monster tamer game. Anything I can play or emulate on a SteamDeck would be great. I have previously enjoyed Dragon Warrior Monsters but never played any of the sequels; similarly, I\u2019ve played SMT and Persona games and found that they were a bit harder than I was looking for.",
            "Started a Wrath of the righteous playthrough (for the sixth time in four years I think) and finally reached act 3 for the first time! The game is fun albeit a bit clunky, I'll probably spend the next few weeks on this before finishing Banishers Ghost of New Eden.",
            "I've been watching a lot of Jacob Geller and am now on the hunt for artsy fartsy \"eat your vegetables\" games that treat video games as an art form first and a form of entertainment second. :THE LONGING: is without a doubt my favorite example of this. Do y'all have any recommendations?",
            "Playing through Divinity Original Sin 2 still.  Kinda took a break from it and started Metro Exodus.  It's bad ass so far.  It's probably because I suck, but every firefight seems super intense and I like the scarcity of ammo.  I also like how in the first open world area, you can kinda choose who to save, who to kill, and the world seems to react to your choices.  I wasn't expecting that at all.  Without spoilers, I've been pretty \"good\" so far.",
            "Tried out 2 games that I'll definitely be coming back to -\n\n**Cyberpunk 2077 (PS5)** First time I tried it last year I couldn't get into it much but this time I've really enjoyed it. It's really engrossing and immersive just driving around, doing small jobs etc. Got to the start of act II. \n\nOn one of the previous bi-weekly threads I was recommended **Remnant II** (which I played on PC through game pass) after beating Remnant: From the Ashes\n\nSo far (3-4 hours in) it is definitely better than Remnant I. The biggest improvement is the UI, the minimap now tells you which areas you haven't explored and which dungeons continue your main objective and which ones are just side dungeons which is very helpful in a game with a procedurally generated map. The weapon variety is better, the loot seems more unique. Playing on normal the bosses also seem to tougher but more interesting and unique. I've beaten Kaeula's Shadow, Mother Mind, and the Corrupter. I was quite low on health, maybe one more shot would kill me, which made the fights more satisfying.\n\nMy only dislike with the game is that there are these spiky ball enemies in the forest that were the bane of my existence. They were fast compared to other enemies, there were lots of them and they liked to spawn behind me as well.",
            "I've been rotating between three games: New Vegas, Into the Breach, and BSG Deadlock.\n\nI've only ever completed vanilla New Vegas so this time I'm hitting all the dlcs with a vanilla+ mod list, basically a slightly altered viva New Vegas plus mods that approximate Project Nevada without breaking the game. Having fun but consistently getting my ass kicked lol.\n\nLove the variety of play styles for Into the Breach . Every mech group plays radically different. Not really much to say about it otherwise, it's just something I pick up when I'm indecisive or want a more passive experience from the turn based play.\n\nBSG Deadlock is an interesting concept that kinda fails to deliver imo. I wish there was more mission variety requiring different fleet compositions. Also maybe a wider diversity in ship roles. ALSO having a true 3d space would make things so much more interesting. Pitch, roll, yaw. You could really make full use of weapon and armor placements. As it stands the maps orient all ships to have an up and down so you can really only control yaw plus the xyz plane. Ah well",
            "Enjoying Deus Ex: Mankind Divided so far.\n\nI upset >!Tars by stealing his credits & drinking his beer!<, so I reloaded my save. Considering a second playthrough :) As petty revenge, I decided to leave his stove on. Then his bodyguard sat on it. What a power move. That man must have augmented glutes and fireproof pants. \n\nI am both impressed and mildly disappointed. Oh well! It\u2019s so nice to play an immersive sim, or any other game where I can mess around. Even if it doesn't result in pants on fire.",
            "Replayed **Gone Home**, since I have a computer again for the first time in a couple years, and I've been itching to replay it. It's a little clunkier to play than I remember, since stuff won't open fully if you stand too close, but \"too close\" still feels unusually far away. Otherwise, the setting is still fantastic, the story is still nice, and it's still one of the best games I've played at giving a sense of putting pieces together to solve a mystery.\n\nMost of my time, though, was spent continuing **Far Cry 6**. I've done a few missions for the Monteros and completed the Yaran story where you drive a tank modified to blast metal music into a town to blow up billboards. Unfortunately, I had too much fun with it and attracted too many enemies, who blew it up, so I mostly had to resort to molotovs and dynamite to destroy the billboards. On the less enjoyable side, I finally got my first base and found out that the game forces third-person in the base. It's not worth quitting over, but it's so bizarre and annoying. On a much more positive note, the game's been offering some fun, unscripted stuff. The highlight this week was small firefight turning into a massive battle in a burning forest, complete with a tank, a helicopter, and many rocket-wielding special forces. It ended when I just made a mad dash through the forest's charred remains, jumped off a cliff, parachuted down near a guerilla path, killed a couple random special forces, and then slipped into the path to get away.",
            "Finally bit the bullet and bought Granblue Fantasy Relink. It's fun but the combat isn't quite as deep as I was hoping. Seems like all the characters I've tried so far have an optimum rotation/combo of a couple buttons that you do when you aren't dodging. I'm only a few hours in and hoping the depth improves as I unlock skills and more characters. It's still fun though.",
            "Just started Marvel's Midnight Suns. Got it for free from Epic a few days ago.\n\nI've been eyeing this game for a while because of how good the reviews are, and so far, I like the combat.\n\nBut, there's one thing I dislike is how much TALKING there are and how annoying they are too.\n\nMaybe it's me because I just finished Divinity Original Sin 2 not so long ago, which also had a lot of talking, and I'm subconsciously tired hearing character talk. Or maybe it's just Marvel in general???\n\nAnyway, I'll probably try it again for a few more hours.",
            "I am playing Cyberpunk 2077. Liking the story and the atmosphere a lot. Very immersive. I\u2019m a little disappointed in the open world; I just came off a playthrough of Fallout 76, which is not the best game in the world, but still has hundreds of locations you can discover and explore. In Cyberpunk you can\u2019t go in to 99 percent of buildings. Still a great game, just doesn\u2019t scratch the same itch.\n\nI am also badly addicted to a deck building mobile game called \u201cPirates: Outlaws.\u201d No Slay the Spire, but still crack. I\u2019ve probably done hundreds of runs and don\u2019t plan to slow down.",
            "I finished **Spirit of the North, Calico** and **Geneforge 5.** I don't have much to say about the first two. I got both for free, and don't think they were something I would have paid more then a few bucks for. Spirit of the North was probably the better of the two, although the cooking game in Calico was fun.\n\nI'm glad I finished the Geneforge series, but I felt like the last game didn't have enough interesting choices compared to the others. However, it was more about tying up the story of the world as opposed to a personal story for the player character. I felt like the ending I got was satisfying. I'll be checking out some other Spiderweb titles.\n\nI started **Control** and **Stray Gods**, but I'm too early in for an opinion on either one. Up next after that is probably **Riven** and **Horizon: Zero Dawn**.",
            "What animal/being is depiced in this subreddit's icon? It is cute but brings up feelings of sadness in me which is very confusing.",
            "Is don\u2019t starve together worth it now that it\u2019s on sale for a couple who enjoyed playing stardew valley and it takes two?",
            "My wife is playing **Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair**, about 2 years or so after I played it for the first time. It is a unique experience to see another person get spun around by the game's main misdirection (I really recommend playing these games for yourself, but for those who won't -- you assume the whole game that >!some ominous mysterious force aligned with the first game's insane villain cult must be behind your predicament, and spend the game paranoid about the 'traitor' among the group who you know to be working for this shadow organization!<, but actually >!this ominous shadow organization is the good guys, and so that whole 'traitor' business leads to the amazing reveal that your \"friend\" who was \"on your side\" was actually your FRIEND and ON YOUR SIDE!!<). At the time when I first played the game I went through the exact same process of falling into the mental trap it sets for you, and in retrospect the truth is *so obvious*, they spoon feed it to you again and again, but you refuse to see it because it doesn't 'fit'. You never stop to think why it doesn't 'fit' and how easy it would be to account for that.",
            "I decided to continue my Etrian Odyssey, this time with **Etrian Odyssey 3 HD**. Let me tell you, this series is teaching me a thing or two about option paralysis, every single time I start a new one of these. I was looking forward to EO3 a LOT, because it has some of the most interesting classes in the series and I love the seabound setting. I live in the middle of Austria, so harbor towns like Armoroad have an inherent vacation feel to them for me, especially in videogames. Most of this is still true after starting the game. I enjoy Armoroad way more actively than Etria, Lagaard or Tharsis. The people here are great too. I especially like Missy, the barmaid. She actually bamboozled me once or twice already because she has a tendency to jumble up words to make up new ones apparently. I kid you not, I broke out a dictionary when it happened the first time, thinking I just learned a very obscure new word. Nah, she's just that weird. But that's exactly my style, so she's cool.\n\n--------------\n\nNow, when it comes to the classes, oh boy. I haven't been this stumped since EO2 HD. The only thing I know is that I want to focus on the Sovereign's passive healing because I've never done that in an RPG before and I want to see how far that can take me. Other than that, I would have loved to use a Wildling and an Arbalist and a Ninja. Wildling is a super unique concept in that they summon beasts who act as temporary party members and deal out status effects. Coming from EO4, they feel like proto Arcanists almost, since beasts kinda act like arcanist circles, with a more physical twist. They are awesome, but they also don't mesh *at all* with the rest of the classes it feels like. For one, they straight up do not work together with the best Ninja skill, because the Ninja's cloning ability and the beast both occupy empty party slots, which you usually only have one of. Second, they don't really benefit from the Sovereign's buffs because the beasts deal all of their damage. You *can* buff the beasts, but unless they become super powerful later, that feels off. Their beast summons also cost a TON of TP to the point that at the start, you can only call the most basic beasts *once*, so at first I thought I needed a Zodiac (this game's caster) to reduce their TP cost to 0 on summoning turns. Turns out at least that issue resolved itself, because Wildlings have incredibly high TP growth. By now, I can call beasts pretty freely and dismiss them to get my TP back. It's a bit clunky, but that part works. He's still the odd one out though.\n\nThen there's Arbalist. They look awesome and they apparently have the highest STR in the game. They are basically glass cannons. The issue: They work best at the *front* since their strongest skill - Front Mortar - gets boosted to high heavens there. This does not work well with the rest of the team at all. For one, I *need* an empty slot in the front so the beast (Elephant) can deal full damage. I also need my Hoplite (the tank) to protect the Princess, but leaving an Arbalist at the front basically requires I switch the Hoplite to bodyguarding the Arbalist.  There's also the issue that the Princess buffs only target lines, not the entire party, so even if I put the Arbalist at the front, he's now the only damage dealer there, making my Attack Order less efficient.\n\nYou see where my problem lies? Every single class I want to use steps on the toes of another one. I'm not rational enough to just kick out one of them, but my game feel currently also isn't great. Sure, I clear enemies fine, because the passive healing component actually works and that feels good, but my damage setup at the moment feels so off. I'd need to spend a few hours to revise the whole thing I think.\n\n------------------------\n\nThat's also why I haven't made a party breakdown yet like I enjoy doing in my Etrian Odyssey posts here. I just don't know if I like my current team.\n\nI have other thoughts on EO3, but I'll save them for another time since my rant on party building needed priority. I'm not joking when I say thinking about the composition is making my head spin.",
            "I think I'm burned out on the souls formula, or maybe just the From Software formula. Returning to Elden Ring to see if I want to buy the DLC and I still really don't like the change from linear levels to open world. I also don't really find it that challenging anymore. %90 of the bosses I can takedown my first try despite not playing the game in over a year. \n\nI'm in this funny mental space where I'm extremely appreciative of From Softwares continued success and growth from a relatively unknown studio into an industry pillar, but at the same time, I wish for an alternate reality where Dark Souls didn't get popular. Even the new Armored Core game felt much more like a Dark Souls game than anything like the old AC games.\n\nIt's very homogeneous. I feel like From Software is no longer taking risks and instead refining a REALLY solid formula and releasing games that are mostly all the same. The differences between Demon Souls and Elden Ring are very minimal if you focus solely on the combat mechanics. \n\nI know the studio can be better than the rest if they tried. AC For Answer is still one of the greatest games I've ever played in my entire life and that came out of nowhere only to never be seen again. I want From Software to make more projects like For Answer, not Elden Ring.",
            "All the talk about the **Elden Ring** DLC reminded me that there was probably a lot of stuff I missed in that game.\n\nTurns out most of what I missed was boss fights and I had forgotten how not fun they mostly are.\n\nI love the atmosphere, the dungeons and their wonderful level design, but the bosses not so much.\n\nThe whole screen is just visual noise to me as they flail about. But lots of people seem to love From's bosses, so what do I know.\n\nI know I turned it off pretty quickly and I think that's it for me with that particular game.",
            "Playing on the Nintendo switch and I cannot overstate how much I enjoy gyro controls and motion aiming in games. I find it literally game changing.  I always found console FPS either too hard to aim or too much aim assist. With motion controls it is so much more interactive and down right fun.\n\nI really don't understand why PS and Xbox don't use them, especially when there controllers actually support it.",
            "I fired up Star Wars Jedi Power Battles again after many years of not playing it and I forgot how fun/janky it was. I know I wear rose colored glasses with this old game but slowly learning new moves and basic powers was fun. \n\nWith beat-em-up brawlers still doing well these days I\u2019m surprised another game like Jedi Power Battles doesn\u2019t pop up again with an original story. The 2D/3D landscape movement has been pretty much perfected these days with games like Mario 3D world and there\u2019s way more Star Wars lore and heroes out than existed in the early 2000\u2019s. A \u201csequel\u201d could be fun to play with all the main drawbacks fixed after many years of gaming experience. You\u2019d think this would be a slam dunk for anyone but EA.",
            "There used to be an essential games list. I know it's kind of outdated (although I guess nothing's technically outdated on this subreddit) but I wanted to check it out!\n\nIs it archived anywhere?",
            "Currently finished Blast Brigade VS the evil legion of Dr. Cread, which I got from my prime subscription. I did 100% of it and that was a very pleasant surprise.\n\n\nI felt the game to be an extremely polished metroidvania. Graphics are cartoon like and very well done, with a likewise cartoon humour/story that got some chuckles from me.\u00a0\nGameplay wise it is really solid, although I felt the enemies to be kinda spongy (the aiming didn't contribute to how slow I felt I was dealing with them).\n\n\nIn the end, I'm surprised this one wasn't mentioned as a good game when released. I think it released on 2022? In any case, I was very impressed with the game and enjoyed it a lot.\u00a0\n\n\nNow I'm deciding which game from my backlog to tackle: Soul hackers 1, Bravely second or grab Trials of Mana now that it is on sale.\u00a0",
            "I've finished Sonic Colors DS, which completes the Rush trilogy. Honestly this game is by far the best of the DS sonic games. It's totally different from the Wii/Console version of Colors, and definitely worth checking out.\n\nGameplay wise it is the same as the previous two entries, with some nice refinements. No more spamming buttons for \"boost gauge\" and the lock on is more consistent. The games divided into 6 zones, with each one having a unique gimmick to try out in two levels, a boss and three optional missions (usually replaying a stage with an extra goal). This is a fun loop, if you find one zones gimmick annoying, you know it won't be around long, and if you enjoy that gimmick there's some extra content to mess around with it. The only gimmick I didn't enjoy was \"Drill\", which controlled quite badly. Most the stages were designed well and I thought the difficulty curve was fair.\n\nColors DS is very short, it took me about 3 hours. I won't fault the game, because it removed lots of the unfair bottomless pits and repeating stages from the previous games. I do miss having Blaze be playable, and compared to Rush Adventure, the bosses are a step down (though still better than the original).",
            "It's funny that gaming, for so long, was compared to and sought to be like thw medium of movies.\n\n\nIn practice, I think the medium of games is the most like music.\n\n\n* Both games and music are based on \"rhythm.\" Games repeat their gameplay loops. A song will repeat a certain action (drum beat, chords, melodies, choruses). In both mediums, depth comes from iterating on those repeated actions in interesting ways.\n\n\n* Movies/books/poems require plot and/or written language to be competently made. However, in music and games, story/words are completely optional.\n\n\nNot sure if there's anything else to this, but this comparison has helped me break out of the box of seeing games as \"interactive books/movies.\" I've begun to see them more as vibes-based experiences that can encompass a ton of different things.",
            "Still playing a 2nd playthrough of **Elden Ring** and a first of **God of War Ragnarok**.  Sort of. I have 30 hours in Elden Ring and 4 hours in Ragnarok.  The start of GoWR doesn't make sense to me. It starts off with a 90 minute cinematic(ish) start to build stakes in a bitter quest for survival and then an hour later sends you into this relatively boring area with a quippy head and some lame dwarves. I'll give it one more try but I have a feeling that Ill be looking for something else to play.",
            "I first restarted **Battle** **Brothers** with a bunch of mods. (Having not played it for a while)\n\nI found out that you can do a \"super-soldier\" by doing the Anatomist origin and feeding upgrade potions to a single bro.\n\nBut i also installed some \"cheat-y\" mods, one of them giving me the ability to modify how many perk points and attribute points bro's get on level up.\n\nMy plan was to run the super-soldier solo, to see how far I can get, without hiring any new ones.\n\nBut then I got an event, and rescued some scoundrel, or was it barbarian or some such.\n\nNow I've got two bros. Well, the 2nd one gets the same \"super improvements\" from the extra attribute perks and stuff.\n\nSo I got to feeling that I may have over-done it, and I may come to realize that I made the game too easy.\n\nAnyways, ended up stopping for now :(\n\n\n\nInstead, just saw that a new patch came out for **Grim Dawn**.\n\nI hadn't played it in a few years, so felt like I might be ready for another Grim Dawn sprint.\n\nI went ahead and \"archived\" my old characters, as well as the Item Assistant backups.\n\nAnd then went ahead and actually installed Grim Dawn on my Steam Deck.\n\nWill see how it goes. Was going to play a dual pistol Purifier (which was probably my very first character back in the day), but then saw that the new patch made a bunch of changes to pets, so pivoted back to my very usual summoner builds (favorite build type in arpgs).\n\nNow I just started leveling a Conjurer.",
            "\n\nHey fellow patient gamers,\n\nLately, I've been completely hooked on Hearthstone Battlegrounds (an autobattler) that I can't seem to get enough of. It's my go-to game right now, and I'm having a blast with it. However, I can't shake this nagging guilt about not diving into my backlog or playing the latest hyped titles.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this kind of guilt? How do you balance playing what you love with tackling your backlog or trying out the newest games everyone is talking about? I'd love to hear your thoughts and any advice you might have!",
            "Stage 2 for the Grand Prix in **Shadowverse** should start tomorrow. I'll have one more free run today to see if I can get another craft to 4-1 before needing to try hard again. Beyond that, there's an event where playing a private game with someone daily gets you a pack and an entry to a raffle. 8 1st place winners get 1 million rupees, 40 2nd place winners get 1000 packs, and 40 3rd place winners get globes to animate cards.\n\nI saw two Cramorants today in **Pokemon Sleep**, but I opted to not feed them anything since neither were hungry. As a F2P player, you only get so many biscuits per month, and Cramorant as non-evolving Pokemon needs a lot of biscuits to recruit. Being hungry triples the amount of friendship points that biscuits give so you'll need less overall. I opted to just feed some of the other Pokemon that did show up hungry instead.\n\nYesterday evening was my second day of doing 10K steps while farming gifts in **Pokemon GO**. Unlike the day before, I actually managed to get all my friends gifts and 20 extra gifts in storage, but I believe that's because a lot of my friends hadn't accepted the gift I already sent them yet. That's understandable, though, with the daily limit of only accepting 20 gifts a day. It just means I might need to add more friends soon.\n\nIn my gacha games, there's a lot more going on this week. **Honkai: Star Rail** just released its 2.3 patch and the guild war has started in **Granblue Fantasy**. **Azur Lane** began its re-run of an Iron Blood event while **Fate/Grand Order** just made one its main interludes free. I've spent most of today working through HSR's new conventional memoir on my computer while I had GBF on my phone grinding the guild bosses.",
            "re: Slay the Spire it took me dozens of runs to beat the heart the first time, you'll get there!

Some of the side quests have decent narrative elements, but most of the time it's just a matter of going to a planet, driving around for a bit, and then clearing out one of two or three cookie-cutter locations to get a few lines of dialogue.\n\nThe main story of ME1 is great, probably the best of the trilogy, but those planet-based side quests for the most part aren't really worth doing IMO.\n\nThe sequels get rid of that planet exploration stuff for the most part and are better for it.",
            "I think ME 1 went for scope of the universe and with how many planets you can explore as back when it came out it was something special. Nowdays yeah, you can explore them and find some extra resources or those \"collect x alien relicts\" quests but you might as well only go on planets when you get a dedicated quest for it from Admiral or chatting with characters to save time. \n\nOh and you might be glad to hear ME2 doesn't have such exploration anymore! :D",

These two games are more relaxing, less punishing. Don't Starve Together has a lot of mechanics to figure out, so lot of patience or the wiki are recommended. Fortunately it has a bunch of settings before you start, so my friend and I usually add more food to the land or reduce/deactivate certain threats. (You might want to try Endless mode instead of the normal Survival mode, so you can just resurrect yourselves at a portal which makes it easier to learn the rest of the game imo because you don't have to depend on another player to revive you and it's less frustrating, especially in the beginning. But that's just a personal tip.)\n\nIn general I would say it's worth it to give it a try as long as you're both aware that the game doesn't really hold your hand and you have to figure things out on your own.",

            "> I also don't really find it that challenging anymore. %90 of the bosses I can takedown my first try despite not playing the game in over a year.\n\nThat's not necessarily a bad thing. I consider it rewarding to have become so good at that gameplay formula that I can beat several bosses on my first attempt.\n\nThat said, I do think this is one of the places where the relatively rigid and simplistic design of Souls combat becomes a weakness. I noticed it especially when fighting Artorias for the first time recently. Even though I died to him several times, I never thought \"Oh man, this is so hard!\" since the strategy to win was so straightforward. I knew all I needed was to see enough of his moveset that I wouldn't fall victim to an unfamiliar attack, and the only reason this was difficult was because of how quickly he could kill me. Same for Manus, though I liked him fight a bit better.\n\nIn terms of mechanical execution, these games have a relatively low skill ceiling (at least if we're talking PvE\u2014barely engage with the PvP so I wouldn't know about that). Just watch a speedrun or SL1 run; the skill on display hardly ever seems out of this world, unlike with a Mario 64 speedrun for instance. Mostly you see them running past every enemy and whacking the bosses to death with the strongest beatsticks they can wield to the point where some die in as little as three or four hits or spend the whole fight staggered, because at the end of the day, there's only so much you can do with this combat system.",

        "content": "Last time I posted here, [I played fallout 1 for the first time and declared it the best fallout game](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/1cr72d1/fallout_1_i_died_to_rats_at_the_start_i_couldnt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Many commentators recommended playing Fallout 2 and using the restoration patch because it fixed the bugs and completed some content.\n\nSo I did and everyone was right. Fallout 2 is the best game and the most questionable in terms of lore and tone, especially working backwards from the modern games.  So these are more my rambling thoughts and experiences playing fallout 2, so you're not getting a cohesive essay with complexity and nuance.  More of a emotional reaction to the strangest parts of the game.\n\nEverything plays exactly like the first one. Same game play, isometric view, and leveling system. The developer gods were kind giving me a \"push\" mechanic when an NPC was blocking a doorway. I reloaded so many times in the first game because I was trapped  by an npc standing in the doorway. There's a lot of consequences and time constraints for some side missions, but the main game seemingly didn't have a constraint this time except a few spiritual dreams reminding me of my mission.\n\nAs for my character, I named him Propane Bobbie, the charismatic gunslinger going from town to town helping the citizens and becoming part of local folklore.\n\nOk, I start out as tribal member who must overcome a holy trial as I am \"The Chosen One\". This chosen one got his ass handed to him 3 minutes in and died, because I missed 100% of my unarmed throws at the last trial. Bobbie was not the chosen one, until I found there's a dialogue option that you can convince the guy you're fighting that \"violence is bad and pointless.\" My methods of persuasion will hopefully be handy this game. Now I'm off to find the Garden of Eden kit to save my tribe. Hell yeah let's see what happened since the last game.\n\nApparently there are ghosts in this game. Yeah I ran into a town and apparently there's a ghost you can meet and get a mission to return an object and bury them in a cemetery. Why? I dunno, I guess it seemed like a cool night time side mission. So of course I ended up ransacking the cemetery thinking there would be guns or that sweet power armor. -1000 karma off the first hour and this will not be the last time you're running into ghosts, there's some weird spiritual stuff on what I assumed was heavily scifi. \n\nI recruited some companions, a tribesman slave who speaks with a Jamaican accent, a tough barkeeper, Marcus the mutant sheriff, and my husband. Yes, I ended up getting married in this game. Very nice to know that sleeping with a dude for shits and giggles ended up with me in a shotgun wedding when the father came in the middle of \"fun time\". So now I'm married, I'm very surprised how progressive this game is with letting you sleep with male and female NPCs. Then my husband got killed in a random encounter with slavers. Our marriage couldn't survive the apocalypse sadly. So I ended up killing the head slaver in one of the first towns for revenge. Had to tell the father in law the passing of his son. Saddest moment for me.\n\nRoleplaying as Bob also comes with shortcomings. I visit the town where Marcus the mutant sheriff is chilling and I meet a scientist who is testing a smart serum on a Radscorpion. I lost a chess match (intelligence skill) and a lock picking (lockpick skill) challenge against a god damn radioactive lobster, he doesn't have hands to pick a lock. HOW??? the only thing I beat the radscorpion in is an eye exam (Perspective skill) . This game feels closer in tone to Fallout New Vegas: Old World Blue DLC at times.\n\nThis game is very big, bigger than the first game and matching expansive modern games. What Fallout 2 has over all other games though is a car. My sweet ride running of fusion cells and carrying the whole crew from place to place faster than ever. Then my car got stolen and had to investigate in a sketchy casino town.\n\nAll these random moments and stories that feel out of place in the modern games makes me wonder if the developers were throwing every idea at the wall because they had to make Fallout 2 in a year (insane!). You know what really surprised me though, Death claws can talk. I followed them to vault 13 and they freaking talk. I want the next game to have them talk, how come nobody in the Fallout subs memed on this?\n\nSo the main plot has you fighting the Enclave. They kinda sucked in the modern games where they came off as a nuisance to me. Here they are pretty metal, you don't mess with them as they massacre families in random encounters as they try to reestablish the U.S. Government.\n\nThen I get to the good old epilogue narrated by Ron Perlman as he narrates each side story about what happened to them. I saved my village, I reunited them with vault 13, I destroyed the enclave, saw NCR expand, and overall was immensely satisfied with my roleplay as Bob. So no complaints from me, except killing kids who pickpocketed my stuff gives me negative karma.\n\nHighly recommend the game as it holds up extremely well with it's addicting gameplay, consequential choices, and surprising don't care attitude about tone. No need to remake this game as it's still a fun game that runs well on modern PCs. ",

            "Fundamentally it\u2019s got a very colorful world\n\n- \u00a0original subquest. Plenty of random shit like boxing matches, hunting slaves, keeping Brahmins ,shooting porn movies,. It keeps tickling your \u201cfunny bone\u201d so to speak.\u00a0\n\n- The cities/settlement \u00a0is impressive personally \u00a0: updated local karma system \u00a0and it makes for great worldbuilding with types of cities - the farming cities , the vice cities (the den, new reno) , all those mining cities (redding, broken hills), the advanced cities (vault city , NCR) \u00a0the ethnic cities (the ghoul settlement, broken hills with supermutants) \u00a0 - and the way their links are hinted \u00a0: the mining cities trading for jet, the competition between new Reno and NCR for regional supremacy . With the car , it really makes you feel you\u2019re exploring a world. That is fucking awesome.\n\n- And obviously you have the choice and consequence\u2026. (A lot more on this)\n\nI really liked it\u2026.\n\nBUT I gradually cooled down on Fallout 2 though.\n\nNot so much because of the pop culture approach. I can block this out of my mind. But I feel that the gaming design is kind of a deadend.\u00a0\n\n- Ultimately It\u2019s all about those scripted scenarios. It\u2019s not a game, it\u2019s a book. \u00a0And not necessarily a great one because the main story is weak compared to Fallout 1. It\u2019s clearly something of an excuse to visit the world and experiencing the C and C. And boy are there things to say about the choice and consequences system.\n\n- \u00a0the famous choice and consequence is a mistake I believe . Way too central and specific and in one key aspect badly implemented (storytelling) \u00a0As for the creative solution it brings : At the moment I \u00a0loved having several ways of solving a quest sure. The way to get the access info for Vault is a wonderful Matroivska doll. So many layers of branching solutions. \u00a0But It\u2019s too static. Ultimatey you\u2019re \u00a0only using the solutions that have been devised by a writing team. At that one place. At that one time. \u00a0Always \u201cplay\u201d out the same. It doesn\u2019t translate the spirit of \u00a0gaming which is UNCERTAINTY . \u00a0Play a sport like Tennis , cards, a FPS , it\u2019s all about the tension of whether you\u2019re going to win and the details of it. Sport fans can talk of great games like thrilling stories whether\u00a0it\u2019s NBA final , an UCL ,. \u00a0 Specifically \u00a0I prefer the immersive sim approach of emergent gameplay/dynamic system which is a better translation for computer of the creativity of RPG.\u00a0\n\n- Another problem of the C&C in FO2 is storytelling \u00a0 - the slides/vignette ending system is nonsense for me - there are so many choices and consequences that it gets lost in detail. It doesn\u2019t make for a great narrative. Most great stories have narrative clarity. Citizen Kane is about a rich man dying regretting his simpler but happier \u00a0childhood. Godfather is about corruption of character. \u00a0Dune is about the danger of Messiah. \u00a0The approach of Fallout 2 is non functioning: no real direction as you build your bright \u00a0new city over the hill but \u00a0can let corruption fester in the den and Reno, let Vault city enslave the ghouls , but help create an alliance between Vault 15 and New Reno. \u00a0Nuance is one thing and I love nuance but I don\u2019t even remember half the stuff like the results in San Francisco it gets lost in the maze of haphazard choice and consequences. \u00a0Sometimes it\u2019s even contradictory as the slide system can have at the same time one slide that says that Vault City develops and another that says that it stagnates and falls under the power of the NCR.\u00a0\nAnd it\u2019s not simply a problem of scale. It\u2019s down to having too many choices about everything until it kills the clarity of the narrative. Even a sprawling \u00a0epic like\u00a0Lord of the Rings had a certain direction: Besides the defeat of the Enemy, you had a great variety of players with the Ents (fading into oblivion) , the Elves (leaving for another land), the Dwarves (that hides as their population is falling down) the Wizard Council (breaking up as its function is fulfilled), \u00a0. But it all went in the same direction : it is about the end of an age and how saving the world doesn\u2019t mean bringing back the magic of the old days. There is a reason why lotr world building is still a reference to this day. Now THAT is storytelling. \u00a0And generally speaking one essential thing to keep in mind is that writing stories is fucking HARD. Some writers write only a few books in their lifetime. Some only write one. Because making one meaningful story takes a lot of soul digging , a lot of life experience, a lot of research. By making all those stories branching out you\u2019re practically ensuring average/mediocre writing. From what I understand Disco Elysium mostly always ends the same way : it\u2019s the journey that changes.\n\n- I could also mention how some players fundamentally dont \u00a0want the pressure of making a \u201cbad\u201d choice. Consequence it\u2019s for the real world . A lot of people want escapism when they play. This kind of design makes some people play with a walkthrough opened to avoid fucking up and feel bad.\n\nTake the C and C out and you\u2019re left with a colorful world but a bad inconsistent main story, \u00a0a turn by turn gameplay which is serviceable but hardly repeatable (and whose fastidious nature is something some people can\u2019t stand, especially younger player) . It\u2019s not a good story like Fallout 1 and it\u2019s not much of a game either.\n\nOverall Fallout 2 is entirely built around a formula that is kind of a non starter. I like the idea of C and C but it cannot be the core of the gameplay by itself.\n\n\nIn a way, It\u2019s great at what it does. Lot of effort put into it. But what is does is really old-fashioned \u00a0compared to what computer can do and ultimately is \u00a0a creative deadend.\u00a0",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/1dlbzly/longtime_mega_man_fan_and_im_struggling_to_see/",
        "content": "Just as the title says, i've been a MM fan for a long time, mainly playing the old games on other people's consoles until they started releasing collections. I absolutely love the classic and X series, and I'd kill for Legends 3, but I never had the money for 6 different BN games in the GBA era. I'm finally playing the first game (I'm at the power plant; 380HP; 7 Buster upgrades), and some of the game design choices are really putting me off. Like I am amazed children put up with this.\n\nTo start, the difficulty is all over the place, or maybe just random. The wrong random encounter at any time will give you a game over and force you to reload a save (no retrying battles why???) I generally save at the start of each new \"room\" in a dungeon, but I am learning that is not enough. \n\nWeirdly enough, major bosses are easy b/c I always save before facing them, and their consistent attack patterns make it easy to anticipate and plan for them with a little trial and error. It's just the random encounters that get me.\n\nThe progression system is also very annoying. Upgrades for your basic attack and HP total are few and far between (and very often, flat out hidden). I can't really find a way to upgrade armor, so attacks that deal 100 damage are always going to deal 100 damage. A lot of attacks seem to do 100 damage. (reminder: my current hp is just 380)\n\nYour primary growth comes through finding new chips, which each represent unique attacks. These are basically like trading cards you assemble into a deck, and every battle starts with you drawing a new \"hand\" of attacks you can use. You can then play multiple attacks if you have either 2 or 3 of a kind, or a straight, or via other mysterious and arcane conditions. (There's also an elemental system at play that doesnt' seem to mean anything?) This is fine and could be the grounds for a unique and fun battle system (I actually remember really loving KH:CoM, but maybe I wouldn't today?) except the cumbersome menus to manage your \"deck\" and the pace at which you acquire new chips make it probably my least favorite thing to do in the game. \n\nAnd there is no experience or leveling system to speak of. Grinding doesn't work, it only tempts fate to give you a battle that will send you back to your last save. The only rewards are chips, and money you can use to buy more chips. There are some shopkeepers that sold hp and buster upgrades, but I cleaned them out early, and afaik, they haven't restocked. They live out in a dungeon, so I'm reluctant to go out and check (even though its in a low level area).\n\nLook, I know people have nostalgia for these games, and I can see the glimmer of good ideas here. I know 2 is supposed to be a giant step up (and also the peak? doesn't bode well for 3-6...) I'm trying really hard to not use the cheats on the collection that turn the game into a cakewalk (I enjoy a sense of achievement from gaming), but I wonder if it's worth the frustration. If any fans have advice, I'd love to hear it, but if the best anyone can offer is \"you need to build a better deck\", then maybe the games aren't for me",

        "comments": [
            "Battle Network 1 to Battle Network 2 is almost the same kind of transition as classic MegaMan 1 to MegaMan 2.\n\nRemember the original MegaMan? They had weird design choices and ideas that were relics of expectations of how the genre *should* be based on other games in the genre. Like how enemies in MM1 dropped Score Pellets that incremented an old-fashioned high score counter that the game tracked. It felt very arcady and like classic platformers did at the time, like Super Mario Bros with a gun.\n\nWell in Megaman 2, they cut out stuff like that, axed the parts that didn't work well, kept and polished the bits that seemed good, and tried to build something new mechanically on top of that as a foundation. A lot of people will say that Classic MegaMan really came into its own and really understood what made it work with its second entry.\n\nBattle Network 2 follows basically the same development trend. Areas are more unique and visually appealing, network layouts are (a bit) less confusing by trying to differentiate pathways with different color palettes when they overlap, enemy design is a bit tighter including a wider variety and better animations, telegraphs, and learnably predictable behaviors. Plus they added new mechanics that lean into the RPG-genre more of growing stronger and gaining (hidden) experience. They cut out some of the questionable decisions and polished up the good bits to shine brighter and help it embrace its unique qualities more.\n\nIn my opinion and experience, very few people say that the series peaks at BN2. I think most in the community would say it peaked at BN3 and then had a heart-monitor-esque path of ups and downs the rest of the way through to 6. I personally enjoyed every entry very much with the poor English localization of the original versions of BN4 for the GBA being the biggest detractor for me (hopefully the collection release fixes the translation errors), but I think BN3 is the last game that the collective fan base seems to majority-agree was a good game in the franchise, with the split happening at 4 onwards.\n\n3 added more mechanical systems that felt very \"correct\" in terms of world-flavour and genre-leaning game design that a lot of people appreciated before 4+ added systems that were a bit more divisive in terms of reception. \n\nAll in all, much like Classic MegaMan, I only introduce new players to the 1st game in the series as a little teaser to showcase where it's roots come from. For an actual playthrough of capturing the real \"experience\" of the franchise, I introduce new people to Battle Network 2 as their first game, just like I usually have them play MegaMan 2 as their first game. They're both just better made sequels.",
            "Battle Network 1 is not a good game, and even the fans of the battle network series admit this. 2 is a huge step over 1 and 3 is a huge step up over 2. 4 is kinda mediocre, 5 is divisive, and 6 is also good. My recommendation is to always skip 1, and just start with 2.",
            "Most people consider 3 or 6 to be the best. I'd agree. I've played through all of them except 5 (for reasons).\n\nYou started with the hardest one to get into, which is good! Viruses are more unbalanced  in 1 than any other, and it also has the blandest chip library.\n\nElements do have a meaning. Mainly, elemental chips deal double damage to enemies weak to it. That includes you if you change your type.\n\nThe other games retain the chip progression, but add a lot of quality of life systems for combat like the Navicust. Unless you're of the same type, attacks will always do the same damage to you. Health is pretty much your only defense besides chips. BN1 has low max health,  but it replenishes after every fight. Later games are the opposite. You tend to have access to more health,  but it doesn't replenish without items/chips.\n\nThe layout improves significantly, too. MMBN1 has probably the worst net layout. I got lost all the time. This still happens in the rest, just less. Shops don't restock as there's a limited amount of chips. There's a point where you have them all, and they're specific to each vendor. \n\nEncounters will work the same throughout. Just how it is. It's supposed to encourage memorizing enemy patterns and prioritizing certain enemies. There's always gonna be a chip that works for a certain situation. That's why you got multiple folders. The grind is in getting the chips you want to make encounters easier, and having different folders for different situations. No retrying is because these were GBA games, and that's how it was back then.\n\nIf you feel up to it, I'd say give 2 or 3 a try. The difficulty curve is a lot better,  and they're less maze like with better balanced viruses and better chips and game systems.\n\nThe story will be pretty much the same in every game, so it doesn't matter much.",
            "While I never played Battle Network 1, from what I've seen and heard it's somewhat primitive compared to the rest of the series. Battle Network 4 is the other black sheep of the franchise (have played it, can confirm it sucks) while 3 is considered the best overall. So it's unsurprising if Battle Network 1 doesn't really click with you.\n\nChildren can surprisingly put up with a lot, especially when it's your only new game.",
            "My understanding is that there\u2019s little held nostalgia for 1. I have nostalgia for 3, but like 6 the most.",
            "I like the first game and tried to play 2 but just couldn't get into it. The major thing I like about the series is the Navi remix designs of the classic robot masters.",
            "I am also a longtime Mega Man fan that tried out the whole Battle Network Legacy Collection during February-March. I didn't love any of them (I thought 6 was okay), and Battle Network 2 might be one of my least favourite games of all time. Backtrack Network is a more appropriate title for the series. The anime is cool as shit though. Outside of the phenomenal battle system that excels in boss fights but is dampened by the frequent random encounters, the series doesn't do anything for me. I would've loved a spin-off focusing on the Liberation Missions in MMBN5.",
            "**TL;DR** - BN1 is frustrating and janky. If you like the theory but not the execution, speed through it to get to BN2. Big jump in quality.\n\nYou're criticisms are valid and shared by most, myself included. BN1 is a prototype for the rest of the series: you can see a good foundation in there, but what's built on top is questionable, frustrating, and sometimes downright bad. I played through it on an emulator a while back and only got through because of save states.\n\nBN2 fixes *almost* everything: better story, MUCH better difficulty curve, the internet is navigable (and interconnected), there's more variety in potential strategies with more chips and abilities, more extra activities to help you buff yourself and your deck, etc. \n\nI've seen BN3 considered the 'peak' of the series, and I think I agree. It sands the rough edges from 2 and fleshes out everything it did well even more.\n\nEither do what you need to do to get through 1 or just skip right to 2. You won't miss any story beats other than \"good guys won in the end.\"\n\nI hope this helps and you have fun with the rest of the series!",
            "These are common opinions even among fans. You won\u2019t miss a ton if you jump into 2 (I think I started with 3 or 4 since Gamestop on the 00\u2019s had varied inventory, before going back and playing the earlier games) and you\u2019ll have a better time. The story and mechanics are certainly better in the other ones. I still liked the later entries, but some of them have their rough points.\n\nAlso don\u2019t be afraid to use guides. 3 onward had official ones, but I used GameFAQs to get through the confusing parts as a kid and, as with many games from that era, sometimes things are nonintuitive. I love the series overall, and even like Starforce.",
            "I played the first 2 when they came out, they were alright. But even as child i realized the grind and conditions for more and better chips was ridiculous. Then i lost respect for the series at 3 (maybe already at 2 for certain end game stuff) when they started splitting the game, pokemon style. So now exclusive content and more work to one hundred percent.\n\nI'll always have nostalgia, but the one time I tried going back i slapped on some cheats to make it better, (infitite money, toggling random encounters), but still couldn't do it for long.",
            "Using maps to navigate is basically a requirement, especially in BN1. Interordi's maps are great.\n\nSave after every fight. Use the collection's Buster MAX mode for repeats of random encounters and grinding boss rematches, and you should be able to enjoy it some more.",
            "Haven't played it yet but I always see fans suggesting that newcomers should start with 2.",
            "BN 1 & 2 remind me of Pok\u00e9mon Red, Blue and Yellow. They just have that old school jank to them where the difficulty is all over place and the design choices are questionable at best. \n\nIf you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t play it! But I\u2019d definitely play 3-6 and maybe give 2 a shot.",
            "Yep this is the answer.\n\n3 and 6 are amazing games. 3 is quite challenging. 6 has challenge, but is good for all skill levels.",
            "I got the first one when it came out...didn't like it and never tried the others...been on the fence about the collection though and this is at least the second time I'm reading that the first one wasn't good compared to the others",
            "It's nice to have my opinions validated, although tbh I would have rather learned about some gameplay feature I missed that would have make the whole thing seem reasonable. If not, how did this review so well back in the day? How did it get a sequel (let alone 5)?\n\nThe power plant was my breaking point and I started looking at maps. And now to be surprised after an incredibly easy Elecman fight with a tougher than average proto-man fight, I'm fed up and turning on the OP buster cheat and gonna start using my OP Bass chip. (Edit: I say all this, and then I went and powered through to beat the Power Plant section w/o using the cheat buster; definitely using maps and Bass going forward though)\n\nI'll do my very best to start fresh with 2 when I'm done and not let this experience sour me on the whole series.\n\nThanks for yours (and everybody else's) response(s)!",
            "Absolutely. Seeing not just their redesigns, but also how their playstyle has been adapted to the new battle system is probably the biggest reason why I'm gonna continue BN1 through to the end and not just abandon it for 2 right now. I'm definitely feeling foolish for not leaning into the cheat options sooner though. It just doesn't feel worth it anymore to the play the game as it was originally intended",
            "I don't blame anyone for bouncing after the first one. I started with the third and worked my way backwards. While going from 3 to 2 was still enjoyable, just a little rough, 1 felt like a completely different (worse) game with some shared mechanics. 6 is still the best the series has to offer I think, and might be the easiest to get into, but playing 6 first might also make it harder to play the earlier ones.",
            "The power plant is absolute baloney. I found it bearable with liberal use of save states.\n\nI don't see another comment that mentions armor. Yes, there is armor you can buy. It reduces damage dealt from most attacks but makes you vulnerable to one element. There are no tiers, just different weaknesses you can choose from.",
            "No problem! Hope you can enjoy the others more. I played through 3, 4 and 6 before 1 & 2. Also had some of them as a kid, so nostalgia helped a lot in getting through 1. \n\n3 is my personal favorite,  it has a great (albeit hard af) engame and secrets,  if you're into that."

        "content": "This review will be a bit short, as I don't have as much to say about the game. Long story short is, I played it back in the day, and now, more than a decade later I've finished it again. \n\nI'll be honest and say that I'm not much of a connoisseur of tower defense games. I played a whole bunch in the internet flash games golden age, but after a few minutes I dropped them as I thought they were boring. More often than not the idea of putting your towers AROUND a path instead of walls IN that path felt stupid to me. I think that's why PvZ was so appealing to me, because settings your defences along 5 lanes felt more organic than just around a few roads. \n\nBut I'm digressing, but I wanted to say is that I LOVE how PvZ is a game that is not really hard, but still manages to introduce their mechanics slowly, getting the player acquainted with its systems. This is specially true when the new zombie type is vulnerable to the new plant unlocked I'll present some examples here:\n\n* 1st: one lane, peashooter and normal zombies. Impossible to lose\n* 2nd: three lanes, and now you should plant sunflowers for additional income\n* 3rd level: now you can destroy enemy squads with a cherrybomb but the zombies are tougher.\n* 5th level: first minigame, which serves to introduce you to different game modes (which happen in all level that end in \"5\"), introduce the only real character, Crazy Dave, and also gives you the ability to dig plants to start again\n* 6th level: now you got pole vaulters, so you should plant something quick so they jump it and move slower. Incidentally the new plant, the mine potato, takes time to activate, so if you plant this in the way it should work with the next zombie\n* 10th level: an easier level with no sun to pick with 7 out 8 plants you've seen already as a wrap-up. This will continue in all levels multiple of 10\n* 11th level:  Night. Bad news: you can only generate sun with plants. Good news: the new plants, mushrooms are cheaper than the previous ones, even with a free one, the puff-shroom. Also, you can get money that remains between levels and you'll be able to use to unlock a new plant slot!\n* 13th level: New enemy: a zombie with a screen-door-shield. New plant: a fume-shroom which can bypass this diffence\n* 15th level: now you access to an almanac that serves a plant-opedia with all the plants and zombies unlocked. \n* 16th level: New enemy: a footballer zombie, one of the best ones in all of the game. New plant: a hypno-shroom that can turn him against other zombies\n* ...\n\nI've realise I could spend an entire hour writing cases, but this shouldn't be as short as I intended. Nevertheless to say, this also happens between \"worlds\" when you unlock the swimming pool and swimming zombies, the night-swimming pool with its fog, and the roof with the catapult mechanic, not to speak of the minigames and side-games.\n\nAs a final question: is there any other tower defense similar to PvZ you recomment? Which other games would you say have a similar difficulty curve? On the top of my head I can come up with FFX, but I have trouble thinking of more. Interestingly, it's easier for me to think of games that do the opposite, that being hard then become easier.",

            "I remember playing the demo, which was time based and then buying the game. That first night, my gf, now wife, walks into the office and says, you know it's past midnight right? Id been playing it over 5 hours straight without realizing it. It's a perfect game imo.",
            "I don\u2019t remember the whole game super clear (played it as a kid), but 4th act (with night and fog) was much harder than anything else in the game. roof was too easy after this nightmare",
            "I used to live near PopCap before they were bought by EA and I knew the guy who created the game's art style, Richard Werner. I was a tester for PvZ2 and gave management all the feedback I could that the game sucks but if you've played it you'd know they didn't address my feedback. \n\nI don't like tower defense games but PvZ1 is so easy for me to pick up and play. I go through and beat it again every year or two. If there's any other games out there like it, please let me know!",
            "I will always hate EA for what they did with PvZ2 once they bought it.",
            "I still remember this game being uniquely fun in a very new sense of the word for a game, it just felt.. clean?",
            "I found the progression of difficulty to be rather slow, and most levels were easily beatable with the same strategy / build order. All the different conditions (night, fog, roof, ...) just change the type of shooting plant you need to plant, but the overall strategy is the same or very similar in almost every level.\n\nIt does introduce new challenges throughout the entire game, but each is too tiny of an increment to be meaningful, and more difficult zombie types aren't numerous enough to force you to change strategies between levels. And many situations that come close to being tricky are trivialized by using one of the bomb plants.\n\nI remember only a handful of instances where I felt challenged and/or had to do something out of the ordinary.",
            "That dolphin cry still wakes me up whenever I hear it.",
            "I adore the game. In fact, at one point I had made a mod that changes some of the plants' statistics to make the game a bit more challenging and balance out some of the plants a bit more.\n\nSome of the changes were:\n\n\\* sunflower now costs 100 sun.\n\n\\* pea shooter now costs 150 sun.\n\n\\* snow pea costs 125 sun, but its firing rate is extremely slow.\n\n\\* cactus costs only 75 sun, so it's no longer outright bad, but its firing rate is extremely slow.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIt gave this fun but laid back game a lot of new strategic depth!",
            "It's in your camp of \"towers around a road\" in some ways, but the only tower defence I enjoyed more is Defense Grid.  Quirky, fun and most levels give you lots of room to strategise and try different layouts and tower mixes.  Highly recommend.",
            "one of the best games ever made, original, fun, replayable, one time purchase, low requirements age wise for entry (my 5year old is having a blast with it...)\n\ni played part 2 on mobile (and recently on android emulators) and had good fun, yes its riddled with microtransactions but honestly at the time nothing really got that itch.. and you can play the game just fine without spending anything\n\n\n\nand 3 just came out very recently",
            "The multiplayer mode that was exclusive to DS and Console versions is so peak its not funny",
            "lol try ps1 Driver intro",
            "One other game that has excellent progression: The Witness. The puzzles are designed to be self explanatory if you play the sequence from the start, it slowly cranks up the difficulty, kind of a masterwork in puzzle design.",

            "any chance i could be pointed in the right direction for an original apk? i'd love for my son to experience it as it should be and not riddled with ads.",
            "PvZ is one of the very few perfect games. Gamers, non-gamers, seemed like almost anyone who touched it walked away a fan. Such a tragedy that it not only had its sequel ruined but that EA seems determined to block it from ever being released again. My tinfoil hat theory is that EA can't release it for modern systems because it would kill all their other tower-defense properties by comparison.",
            "Still a 10 out of 10 game even though EA seems to pretend it doesn't exist. I am still cross about what they did to PopCap.\n\nFor years Plants Versus Zombies 1 was my go-to recommendation whenever some one asked for a game for their non gamer friend / partner/ parent etc. It is one of those unique games that appeals to everyone from newbies to hard core.",
            "I love that game too!",
            "> As a final question: is there any other tower defense similar to PvZ you recomment? Which other games would you say have a similar difficulty curve?\n\nKingdom Rush's difficulty curve is pretty good. If you abuse teslas it becomes too easy the moment you get them, though.",
            "Bloons TD is brilliant as well.",
            "It's a super fun game but I found it laughably easy, there isn't really much strategy involved, even replaying and choosing your own plants it's pretty trivial. One or two extended game modes are a little tricky but that's the extent of it",

            "Some games have been playtested to death, which have made them balanced perfectly for player engagement. Bejeweled is another good example. Designers of the game playtested the game tons, finding exactly the score requirements needed for each level so that a level would end and the player would win as soon as they even started to get slightly bored.",
            "I just loaded this up again after years not touching it, and it won't go full screen. Anyone have this experience?",

            "It's unbelievable how much of an unplayable train wreck the sequel was.",
            "The golden era of mobile gaming back when the ipod touches first rolled out. Games were made for pure enjoyment and sold for like $1-5 with no microtransactions. PvZ, fruit ninja, so many others.\u00a0",
            "Seriously. The really awful part is that PvZ 2 has a *ton* of content, but it's mobile-only and absolutely riddled with microtransactions. Basically unplayable.\n\nThere are hacked APKs you can download for it, but... fuck, I wish it had gotten a proper sequel.",
            "Laura Shigihara is a treasure.",
            "[The whole OST is amazing, especially Graze the Roof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9xSFk1ZDgw)",
            "I had no idea this existed, i certainly didn't expect such a chill song as well, and that football player is killing me.",
            "You are absolutely correct, the fog made those levels way harder than even the final stages.",
            "Then you probably played badly as the whole game is just a slow increase in difficulty and complexity. Honestly the only point where I think it *hard* is the second to last level. Specially if you don't have 9 slots",
            "im sad about pretty much every other popcap IP too. I would love to buy the bookworm adventures series but that's looking like it's never going to happen",
            "maybe you're thinking of cohesive?",
            "Yeah I agree with this. I\u2019ve always found the game to be on the easier side, and I\u2019m not a regular tower defence player. But I enjoyed finding a pattern that could handle pretty much scenario, even if it meant just putting down the same plants 80% of the time.",
            "It's great for non gamers",
            "This is pretty spot on.  Great game and fun, but a lot of levels are sufficiently the same that I just spend the time working on having a perfect layout or producing way too much sun, or seeing how long I can delay on spending so I can jump directly to gatlings",
            "I'm guessing not everyone has an intuitive sense of the game.  I agree, where and what you place in the lanes doesn't vary, regardless of setting.  Production on the last row. Barriers towards the front.  Offense in the middle.\n\nThe only variations on the overall strategy are usually defeated with whichever plant is introduced after seeing the new variation.  The only zombie that poses the biggest issue to me is the digger zombie.  However, that is more about which plants to use to get rid of them quickly.",
            "I actually had more fun playing PvZ 2 at lauch because difficulty ramped up a lot quicker in that game. Levels were challenging enough that it felt satisfying when I beat them, but not enough to be frustrating.\n\nThough the later maps that got added in updates got too hard and I couldn't beat them without following videos on Youtube. So I dropped the game.",
            "Only question is how quick you see the basic setup. People coming to it without that already in their bags, probably going to have more fun figuring it out.",
            "I tried a mod similar, i think it was called \"Replanted\".  \nSadly it is bugged and the bungee zombies are both literally unkillable and take a full minute to pull away, meaning that anywhere they station themselves becomes a zombie spawn point. Which is bad if said spot is the back row.",
            "I'll look it out, thanks",
            "Oh yeah, I've heard about it. Overall puzzle games have great progression, probably because of how controlled how few elements there are. Portal 1 and 2 also excel in that",
            "I have some very old pirated copy still installed on my phone which works. I can upload it on my gdrive if you want.\n\nedit: here ya go\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/156TNhcVMauqS2WNBnL3owJxrkmEguaX1?usp=drive_link",

            "EA happened",
            "Yeap, that's the case with Valve games, for example, as Mark Brown said in his video last year",
            "The sequel was solid, but their efforts to add microtransactions and make it multiplayer-ish with pay-to-win really screwed it over.",
            "I thought the sequel was alright actually. Yeah not nearly as great as the original but still fun. It offered a lot of variety in how to complete levels and challenges. They also overhauled the game like a year or two after release.",
            "Infinity Blade, zombieville USA, Fieldrunners, Battleheart, doodle jump, Jetpack Joyride, Angry Birds, sheesh lots of great titles",
            "PvZ was a PC game ported to phone, it wasnt a phone first game.",
            "Don't forget Galaxy on Fire 2, an actual proper game in an established PC genre fitted for mobile and not just a small flash game concept.\n\nAlso EA (of all companies) made good ports like Red Alert iOS and Sim City for phones.",
            "You can currently buy Slice and Dice and just play with no microtransactions. One of the best mobile games ever made, and it starts with a free trial. If you like it you just pay to unlock the rest of the game and keep your progress.",
            "And even if you DO get a hacked APK, you still have to dance around the design meant for microtransactions.",
            "I can't imagine how you could even patch it. It's entirely designed around pay-to-win. Pay enough and you win. Don't pay and eventually it will be impossible to win. You'd have to playtest exactly how much premium currency you should have available to spend on each level to make it appropriately challenging.",
            "Every song in this game is so damn good. She killed it.",
            "She made a sad but wonderful little RPGMaker game called Rakuen that I highly recommend, about the victims of the Fukushima nuclear disaster.\n\nIt will especially appeal to you if you're familiar with To The Moon or Spiritfarer.\n\nI discovered her after she sang the brief line of lyrics at the end of Deltarune chapter 1.",
            "It's somehow chill and hype at the same time",
            "It plays along with the video when you beat the game",
            "yeah no way I played good at that time",
            "In those cases I resort to \"the other option\"... It's only fair",
            "the main campaign is very easy and casual from start to end, and doesn't really ask you to develop strategies much deeper than the ones taught to you in the first 3 levels. just like portal, nearly the entirety of the main campaign is just well-designed tutorials. \"here's a new mechanic, here's a new challenge for you to solve, now you know how to use this plant and how to counter this zombie.\" \"here's a fun minigame to mix things up that's nearly impossible to lose.\" but once you get to the end, you've finally learned the basics of everything the game has to offer. then it can truly set you loose and put all you've learned to the test.\n\nthe real meat of the game is everything after the main story. now that the game knows you know everything; it can throw you in tougher challenges, send a greater variety of zombie types that test your ability to make a well-rounded deck instead of just picking the one plant that counters the one new zombie, and it can take all those side modes and really ramp them up so they become interesting twists that prompt completely new strategies. niche plants that go previously overlooked in the main campaign like instas, garlic, and nighttime plants are given more time to shine in modes that demand their unique capabilities.  the game has a wide variety of things to offer that challenges the basic strategy of sunflowers/peashooters/walnuts.\n\nits still not *that* hard of course. its a pretty simple casual game. but there is a lot of strategic depth and optimizations to be made once you're pushed to seek them out. i'd imagine this is the reason PVZ2 still maintains a dedicated fanbase after all these years; even though everyone knows its a disgraceful, money-grubbing, overly-grindy, shitty mobile game. since its so endlessly grindy and full of \"content\", there is a lot of time and room to have players develop interesting and varied strategies to keep things fresh for thousands of hours. ~~or maybe because its a shitty mobile game designed to psychologically manipulate you into forming unhealthy habits and playing it every day even though you don't really like it. that too.~~",
            "Can't go wrong - it's pretty cheap these days and you get a ton of playtime out of it, including multiple modes on every level and gold-silver-bronze achievements, plus extra DLC levels... one of the few games I've enjoyed enough to get every single gold achievement on.\n\n(Sadly the sequel kind of sucked in my view, which was a bit weird).",
            "It is an excellent recommendation. The only two tower defense games I've enjoyed after pvz are defense grid and kingdom rush.\n\nHave fun!",
            "i really appreciate you pal. thank you!",
            "Maybe I played it too early. It felt impossible to beat when I played it shortly after it came out.",
            "Just throwing this out there, but some insane madman just ported Infinity Blade 1 to PC. I just played it last week. It was amazing. Pure nostalgia but surprisingly the gameplay somewhat held up too.",

            "Heck, Cut the Rope started an entire series of games I gladly paid for back then.",
            "It is beatable, actually. Well, before they added new harder levels anyway, that's when I played. Before that upgrade system. Some levels are very hard, but still doable.\n\nThe worst part is that it has some good ideas about it, lots of fun enemies and plants; fun gimmicks, but it is ultimately ruined by mtx live service bullshit.",

Giraffes?\n \nIf you answered yes to any of these then I have the game for you!\n \nCastle on the Coast is simple 3D platformer designed for kids or those new to the genre but the gameplay is such a joy that anyone who likes platformers and collect-a-thon games will have fun.\n \nYou\u2019re playing as George, the mascot of Valley Children\u2019s Healthcare. He\u2019s a goofy giraffe who is also a parkour artist.\n \nThe gameplay is tight and the controls are perfect. Think Mario 64, you have a triple jump, can wall jump, spin, dive, wallclimb, and can even unlock a jetpack at one point. Without much difficulty you can make George do whatever you want.\n \nThere are a few aspects of this game that really made it unique and a joy to play:\n \n* You can turn off invisible walls\n \nYes that\u2019s right, the devs had the foresight to allow the player to turn off those pesky invisible walls if they so choose.\n \nI like this design choice for a number of reasons. If you see an area, you should be able to go there, jankiness be damned. Sure the textures, models and skybox might pop in and out until you get to a stable area, but it give you a level of freedom seldom seen in most games. There are even a few achievements based around breaking the game! In fact, you can just skip the entire game and go right to the final boss if you choose.\n \n* Controls are fluid\n \nNothing tanks a game harder than poor controls. Here the controls are fluid and setup to maximize the fun. George is responsive and you can parkour him anywhere with minimal effort.\n \n* Aggressive checkpoints\n \nIts not easy to die in this game but it does happen. But no fear, checkpoints are everywhere so if you do you wont be going too far back, you\u2019ll be able to pick up where you left off.\n \nMy only complain with the game is navigating the castle can be sometimes be tricky. You use warp zones to get from one place to the next and they are not labeled, you just have to figure it out on your own. I spent a lot of time getting lost in the netherworld just trying to get from one place to the next.\n \nThe closest game I have placed recently that I can compare it to is Tinykin, except Castle on the Coast is way more janky but in a good way.\n \nOverall if you enjoy platformers, collect-a-thons and 3D movement based games then you should check out Castle on the Coast.
