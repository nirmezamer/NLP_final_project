        "content": "Hello Everyone!\n\nr/UFOs will be hosting an AMA with Yuan Fung and Matt Ford from the UAP Disclosure Fund, on **Saturday June 22 at 1:00pm PST** ([Click here for your local timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=r%2FUFOs+-+AMA+with+the+UAP+Disclosure+Fund&iso=20240622T13&p1=137))\n\n[The UAP Disclosure Fund](https://www.uapdisclosurefund.org/) is a nonpartisan political nonprofit 501(c)(4) that advocates for greater government transparency regarding unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP). They work to support new UAP legislation, provide legal representation for whistleblowers, promote scientific research and raise public awareness in an effort to better address the UAP issue.\n\nTheir team includes:\n\n- Luis Elizondo (Board of Directors)\n- Garry Nolan (Board of Directors)\n- Karl E. Nell (Board of Directors)\n- Christopher K. Mellon (Advisory Board)\n- Kirk McConnell (Advisory Board)\n- Yuan Fung (Executive Director)\n- Matthew Ford (Director of Strategy)\n- Lesley Duckworth (Chief Financial Officer)\n\nThe UAP Disclosure Fund is [currently petitioning](https://www.uapdisclosurefund.org/#petition) for UAP legislation to be included in the 2025 NDAA.  Now is the time to let the U.S. Senators who cosponsored the UAP Disclosure Act of 2024 know that you support including a new version of the UAP amendment in the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)!  You can sign the petition [here](https://www.uapdisclosurefund.org/#petition) to let lawmakers know that UAP transparency and legislation is important to you.\n\nYuan Fung has worked for over 20 years as a creative director and consultant for campaign politics and issue advocacy. He has worked on behalf of congressional, gubernatorial, senate and presidential campaigns.  Highlights include the late Senator Harry Reid, and both of Obama's presidential campaigns.  He has also done work for causes like consumer safety, the environment and clean energy.  Leveraging his political expertise and talent, he is now the executive director for the UAP Disclosure Fund.\n\nMatt Ford is an Emmy-winning political consultant, media personality, and producer based in Los Angeles. He is a trusted advisor to leading congressional representatives and their staffers on the UAP issue.  Matt has spearheaded numerous successful projects as a producer, including creating over 100 political ads for social media platforms which have been viewed by millions.  His production prowess extends to hosting The Good Trouble Show, where he engages in thought-provoking discussions with influential figures such as Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and other prominent political figures.  He is now the Director of Strategy for the UAP Disclosure Fund.\n\n---\n\nWe're thrilled to have Yuan and Matt participate in this AMA with the community, and we know that everyone is sure to have lots of questions! If you're unable to attend, but would still like to ask questions, feel free to share them below and we'll do our best to facilitate them on your behalf.\n\nIf you have any feedback or thoughts on other guests you'd like to see, message us directly here or let us know in the comments below.",

            "Just a friendly reminder to everyone that during the AMA, the mod team will be actively removing any questions that are inflammatory, overly accusatory or otherwise uncivil (no different than any other AMA that we have conducted in the past). With that being said, we absolutely want to be permissive in letting the community ask whatever questions they might have - even if they are hard questions. We just want to ensure that the questions are asked respectfully and with kindness towards guests that have given their time to engage with the community.\n\nAlso, please post your questions as top-level comments, not as replies to this sticky. We will not collect any questions that are posted as replies to this stickied comment. Thank you!",
            "**QUESTION**\n\nIf what Grusch has said is true, and If multiple, high level whistleblowers have already provided evidence to congressional staff, who are now well aware of things behind the scenes that the public is not privy to, how realistic can \u201cpublic pressure\u201d  be at this point? If the UAPDA can be blocked by just a handful of people, presumably under the influence of the \u201cgatekeepers\u201d, what inside deals can be made to persuade them to disclose? Every strategy thus far essentially boils down to pleading with them. What can organizations like yours offer the \u201cgatekeepers\u201d that would be enticing for them to give up their secrets?",

Everyone talks about Coulthart and mocks his continual \"I can't divulge my sources\" spiel, but this was one of the biggest things ever dropped in this community and nobody even questions it.",

Are there any avenues of disclosure an individual could pursue (that don\u2019t involve donating money or disclosing my identity) that might result in more salient, personal disclosure? I.e. is the UAPDF aware of any practices or protocols that could result in contact experiences and/or increase an individual\u2019s metaphysical understanding of the phenomena?

Another 21 mods perform the next 45% of significant actions. I'd say there are about 28 active mods currently. \n\nIt's important to keep in mind many moderation tasks extend past the modqueue and there are many aspects which can't be tracked, such as efforts developing or maintaining our bots, responding to modmail, organizing AMAs, interviewing and training new mods, running monthly mod meetings, and maintaining [the subreddit wiki](https://ufos.wiki/).\n\nThere is significant variance in terms of how much each mod contributes and in what area. All this is relative though to how much work there is to actually do as well. I could spell this out with metrics if you're interested.\n\nIn my experience most people only mod for 3-12 months and then fade out. This aspect combined with the explosive growth of the community over the last year pretty much necessitates we issue calls for new mods every 3-4 months or so, just to try and keep up. Unfortunately, the subreddit has been undermoderated for a couple years now along with the the expected growing pains, so getting it up to a sustainable point has been difficult.",

How long do they stay active regularly? \n\nHow often do your subreddit rules change? How often and to what length do you have to deliberate such changes internally and externally? We have a very lengthy and thorough process, on both ends.\n\nDo you use a flat structure where all mods have an equal say in votes? Or does just one or a handful of people direct things? Reddit is inherently hierarchical, which is an arguably more efficient and faster organizational model, it just has a number of cons we prefer to avoid.",

It's a team effort, not a competition. Heck, if you just wanted to do comment moderation and limit your activities to approving comments (the ones that don't break any rules), that would be welcome. \n\nAnd if you have any questions, feel free to reach out here or directly.

Dr. Tesla insists there is nothing sensational about it, that it is but the fruition of many years of work and study. He is not yet ready to give the details of the engine which he says will render fruitless any military expedition against a country which possesses it. Suffice to say that the destructive invention will go through space with a speed of **300 miles a second, a manless airship** (1,080,000mph 1,738,091kmh) *without propelling engine or wings*, sent by electricity to any desired point on the globe on its errand of destruction, if destruction its manipulator wishes to effect.\n\nTen miles or a thousand miles, it will be all the same to the machine, the inventor says. Straight to the point, on land or on sea, it will be able to go with precision, delivering a blow that will paralyze or kill, as is desired. A man in a tower on Long Island could shield New York against ships or army by working a lever, if the inventor's anticipations become realizations.\n\n\n\u201cIt is not the time,\u201d said Dr. Tesla yesterday, \u201cto go into the details of this thing. It is founded on a principle that means great things in peace; it can be used for great things in war. But I repeat, this is no time to talk of such things.\n\n\u201cIt is perfectly practicable to transmit electrical energy without wires and produce destructive effects at a distance. I have already constructed a wireless transmitter which makes this possible, and have described it in my technical publications, among which I may refer to my patent 1,119,732 recently granted. With transmitters of this kind we are enabled to project electrical energy in any amount to any distance and apply it for innumerable purposes, both in peace and war. Through the universal adoption of this system, ideal conditions for the maintenance of law and order will be realized, for then the energy necessary to the enforcement of right and justice will be normally productive, yet potential, and in any moment available, for attack and defense. The power transmitted need not be necessarily destructive, for, if existence is made to depend upon it, its withdrawal or supply will bring about the same results as those now accomplished by force of arms.\"...\n\nNew York Times\nDecember 8th, 1915",

Not to be a conspiracy theorist, but what if some geoengineering operation was carried out to hide what could be visible in the sky by inducing the arrival of Sahara wind just in these days? \n\nReturning to the topic of geoengineering, a month ago there was a reoccurring anomaly recorded by Ventusky, who then denied it as a data recording error, but the excuse does not hold up because the same anomaly was also recorded by satellite data from another platform. The anomaly occurred in the south-west of South Africa, north of Antarctica which coincidentally had its center in the misterious Bouvet Island.",

            "i seem to have a really intuitive understanding of how all this works and i've been posting about it lately, no coincidence, so i'll try to explain as best i can, a lot of this is just hiding basic shit deep behind science jargon all of which is almost entirely plagiarized from nikola tesla.\n\nLet the future tell the truth, and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments. The present is theirs; **the future, for which I have really worked, is mine.** nikola tesla, 1926\n\nokay lets break this down, pais says ''It is possible to reduce the inertial mass, and hence the gravitational mass, of a system/object in motion, by an abrupt perturbation of the non-linear background of local Spacetime (equivalent to an accelerated excursion far from thermodynamic equilibrium, analogous with Symmetry-breaking).''\n\nfirstly its worth noting that ''local spacetime'' is never really in thermodynamic equillibrium because the background energy in any given point in spacetime is dynamic, constantly in flux with the universe around it. anyway ''an abrupt perturbation in local spacetime'' is simply any electric impulse outside of that normal background fluctuation. so what this is saying is that an electric impulse with the proper characteristics can reduce the inertial and gravitational mass of an object.\n\nhe confirms this when he goes on to say that the physical mechanism which drives this is the force exerted by the local vacuum energy state. he achieves this ''by a coupling of accelerated high frequency vibration with accelerated high frequency axial rotation of an electrically charged system/object''\n\na radio transmitter pulsing in the proper configuration\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HyJuhqPayI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HyJuhqPayI)\n\nto understand how electricity and gravity are related one must return to basics. ''the vacuum'' is just a modern term for ''free space'' as in, the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability of free space. the dielectric permittivity of free space is a mathematical ''constant'' which reflects the ability of an electric field to pass through the vacuum.\n\nit is widely known that electrical engineering mathematics is idealized and no such ideal vacuum exists in nature due to the constant fluctuation which means that a dielectric is an electrically insulating material and the dielectric ''constant'' is a measure of that material's ability to permit electric fields. thus the dielectric ''constant'' varies depending on the material in question. here, we're talking about vehicles traversing inter-planetary/inter-stellar space so the dielectric we are dealing with here is atmospheres on planets and moons and the highly rarefied, ionized and DYNAMIC inter-planetary/inter-stellar winds.\n\nmathematically, the vacuum permittivity is equal to one over the magnetic permeability times the speed of light squared thus mathematically linking the speed of light with the dielectric constant. this is why satellite clocks run a little faster than clocks on earth because the atmosphere being thinner up there changes the dielectric constant which changes the apparent speed of light through the dielectric of the atmosphere\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTzGBJPuJwM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTzGBJPuJwM)\n\nnow consider the secondary magnetic fields produced by an electric current. the secondary magnetic field can be controlled by controlling the primary electric impulse and this is how you get salvatore pais' vacuum engineering. throw that ass (the electric current) in a circle, you get a circular magnetic field, kinda like tesla's polyphase. so with the right circuitry you can use electric fields to engineer the dielectric permitivitty and magnetic permeability of free space thus allowing for apparent faster than light phenomena\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nspinning magnets can quantum lock without a superconductor\n\n[https://youtu.be/V5FyFvgxUhE?si=14D8G55UONYAFKO5%C2%A0%C2%A0](https://youtu.be/V5FyFvgxUhE?si=14D8G55UONYAFKO5%C2%A0%C2%A0)\n\nanother way to think of it, the local vacuum/whatever dielectric in question can be engineered to be a superfluid/ferrofluid. scientists have recently found they can tune the casimir effect by using a ferrofluid i.e they can tune quantum fluctuations with magnetic fields\n\n\u00a0\u00a0[https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a61148470/casimir-effect-control-nanotech-breakthrough/](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a61148470/casimir-effect-control-nanotech-breakthrough/)",

This is just gonna be another UFO/UAP documentary. \n\nUnfortunately, the big bombshell kind of things are gonna come from either the government, or someone like David Grusch / Luis Elizondo that has smuggled documents or some type of evidence that the public hasn\u2019t seen yet.\n\nThe longer that this process drags out behind the scenes in my opinion, the higher likelihood there is for catastrophic disclosure. \n\nAnd that\u2019s honestly a good thing because the government should be held accountable for what\u2019s going going on here, and I think a lot of people are actually be upset when they learn what the governments been doing and getting away with for the last hundred plus years.\n\nto be honest, this feels like it\u2019s more than just a UFO revelation and it\u2019s more along the lines of massive fraud & waste, abuse, and people who have been harmed reengineering these crafts and people who\u2019ve been murdered to cover this up. It\u2019s just a lot more than just aliens at this point \n\nAnd in my opinion, that\u2019s what the government fears more actually is the amount of repercussion that\u2019s going to happen.
