        "content": "**Edit to clarify title: Title sounds a bit harsh after reviewing, I would like to clarify that the source of the fraud charges are currently unknown and have not been confirmed by the fraud department or an external team. That being said after reviewing my purchases alongside any other potential information leaks such as personal data leaks from online purchases for instance, etc... below is the most likely source of my fraud charges. Apologies for any confusion / making it sound as though this is definitely the case. I'd change the title however I am unable to do so**\n\n**Edit 2: I am going to stop following up as I feel like there is enough information here to both clarify any questions people had and also to achieve my intended purpose of warning others that there may be potential fraudsters on the specific line I indicated in the comment section for TD bank. I will only give a followup if the TD fraud department can give me a conclusive answer to my open claim I can share. Again don't be an idiot like me and provide any bank representative with your full bank card information even if you believe them to be a legitimate representative. At the very least ask your bank the verification procedures so you can remain vigilant**\n\nLet me start by saying that this incident was a result of my own negligence. I had my guard down, thinking I was communicating with a secure contact during a stressful situation. It could have been easily avoided if I had been more vigilant.\n\nIn short, I gave my card information to verify my identity to resolve an issue with the card. This led to some minor fraudulent charges, which I detected immediately thanks to TD MySpend. I was able to shut down the card before the charges became serious.\n\nWhat caught me off guard was the boldness of the person claiming to be from TD's internal team. A TD representative later mentioned that this line is handled with a partner company but I can't confirm this.\n\nHeadline: Learn from my mistake\u2014never give out your full card information, even to supposed banking representatives. Especially avoid calling the Canada to US banking line, as active fraudsters are operating there.\n\nHopefully this helps someone down the road as I doubt fraud team will catch these guys as I don't believe they keep internal records of calls, especially if they are working with a partner company on that line.",

            "As a car salesmen I\u2019ll give a few tips. \n\nI\u2019ll start with your Toyota Canada quote, it should be similar in price to the website, however Toyota Canada isn\u2019t a dealership so expect dealer fees included. Usually admin which isn\u2019t negotiable, but sometimes they add additional dealer fees that can be negotiated.\n\nIt may not be in your favour to buy cash unless they have explicitly told you the car is available. If they haven\u2019t said that yet, say you\u2019re financing until they admit it\u2019s available and then ask for the cash price. Sometimes dealers will hold vehicles for finance deals because they make more money.\n\nYour negotiation power comes from how many vehicles they have in stock, if they only have 1 and it hasn\u2019t been on the lot very long, then they\u2019re not going to be as willing to reduce price compared that\u2019s overstocked. Do you\u2019re research and see if other dealers in the area have this same car and use that as ammo. \n\nBe polite, be firm, ask questions and ask to see a breakdown of the price. Don\u2019t be a dickhead or else you\u2019ll get fucked, seriously. They may not even want to sell you the car if you piss them off enough. Make sure they aren\u2019t forcing you to buy a protection package if you don\u2019t want one.  The finance/business manager has some power to reduce the cost of the warranty as he makes his commission of that product. In my experience, the business manager will ask upon delivery of the vehicle if you changed your mind about warranty if you initially declined. At this point they may be more willing to reduce the cost over not making anything, but they also may not and then you\u2019re screwed if you actually wanted it so be careful. \n\nThe salesperson is NOT your friend. If they\u2019re good they\u2019ll ask about your life, job, kids, hobbies. All of this can be used as ammunition to close you and back you into a corner where it doesn\u2019t make sense to say no. Try and answer a personal question briefly and switch it to a question you have about the vehicle so that they can\u2019t continue to get more details. Ask some questions at the beginning that will mess up the salesperson, like the type of suspension, size of the gas tank, max range on a full tank. You want to ask a question they can\u2019t answer because it\u2019ll mess up their confidence. Ask like 3-4 of these and you\u2019ll feel a lot less pressured because they\u2019ll be scared you\u2019ll ask another tough one if they keep talking. Don\u2019t make it seem like your horny to buy a car today because they\u2019ll be able to tell. Just be reserved and say something like you\u2019ve just begun your search and are comparing brands. Say this while you\u2019re negotiating though not at the beginning or else they may just launch you \n\nGood luck!",
            "I just bought a truck and here's what I did. Start a new gmail email address and don't give them your number. That way you're not inundated with calls and annoying emails clogging up your inbox...because the salesman are relentlessly annoying. Email 3 dealerships what you're looking for and price. Lowball all of them and see how they react. Keep playing with all of them until you get a feel for where you're getting the best price.",
            "Why not just take the dealer financing to get the best price on the car and then just pay out the loan in full the next month? All car loans in Canada are open ended loans with no prepayment penalty. \n\nThe dealer will hate you because the bank will clawback their finance bonus but who cares.",
            "Others have given good advice. Just a heads up, be prepared to pay more or less the MSRP for the Rav4's. There is a waitlist of 6-12 months for the gas and 12-18 months for the hybrid. I have tried but they aren't willing to negotiate since they don't have vehicles sitting. The most you might be able to haggle is maybe throwing in an accessory or warranty but no guarantee of that.  \n\n\nYou can find dealerships that will not force add-ons, I did when I ordered. I ended up cancelling my order since my order was still a year out and needed a car sooner.",
            "Buying with cash actually gives less leverage as stealerships prefer you finance with them for the kick-back. \n\nI think stock for most cars improved, but a lot of stealerships will try to tag on additional fees/items such as requiring VIN etching for a few hundred.\n\nIf the car is high in demand, expect to pay a dealer \"mark-up\" or to pay for a lot of useless packages. I think for a regular non-hybrd Rav 4, stock should be okay.",
            "you need to walk out on the spot if you don't like anything about the deal.",
            "I you want a Rav4 then there is not much negotiation room...they were on a 2 month wait list in April when I bought a new CRV. \n\n5 different dealerships and none were willing to budge on price. \n\nOtherwise some good advice below about negotiating the best price by negotiating financing...then paying the financing out in month one. Other than the PPSA charges that is probably the best approach.",
            "Visit the dealership a few times. Go to the washroom, look around. At one point you\u2019ll find the salesmen\u2019s lounge or rest area. There usually is a chart indicating each of their sales %performance for each month. Go there the LAST week and see who is the lowest performer. Make sure he is there the day you visit. If that guy wants to make his monthly quota and bonus, he will razor cut the profit margins to get a sale.",
            "Different car, different market, but when I wanted to buy a car in cash without haggling because I knew what I was willing to pay, I emailed six dealers in the city saying exactly that - I'd like to by X car at Y price for cash, let me know if you can make that happen.\n\n\nMaybe 4 emailed me back but only one of them was straight up \"yes, we've got that car on the lot, are you okay with black, we can do that price\".\n\n\nThe no-bullshit attitude in the email translated into no upselling of financing bs, just the usual extended warranty stuff. It was probably their quickest sale and they treated me just fine. (AND I'm a woman who brought my husband and they didn't even try to talk over me at him.)\n\n\nSo yeah, email could be a great screening device!",
            "If you go to one dealership and look for the best deal possible you won't get it. You don't get the best deal shopping at only one store.\n\nFirst, visit multiple dealerships. Don't walk in there to buy, walk in there to look.. test drive ask questions then leave. Do this for 3-4 places and the vehicles you are interested in.\n\nReach out to the dealerships you felt most comfortable with and ask for a quote. Try to make it clear you are shopping at different places. One way is through small talk.. \"I tried a Tuscan but it had bad seats\" or \"Rav4 didn't feel powerful enough\" etc.\n\nWhen you get the quote look at it carefully. Make sure the numbers add up. E.g their biweekly should match the price, if not there are hidden fees etc. \n\nTo understand how to get the best deal, understand how dealerships make money, which is through hidden fees. If you don't understand their numbers breakdown you lose. Once you are comfortable with their numbers, look to eliminate all their bullshit fees. Examples are \"security etching\", \"other fees\", \"maintenance package\" etc.\n\nAt the end of the day it's a numbers game. Walk away from anyone who won't give you a detailed breakdown because they are about to F you over.",
            "Some general tips:\n\n* Be polite, be kind, be patient\n* Understand that at the end they will try and upsell you things like protection plans, so there's almost always a bump compared to what you see\n* Do your research beforehand about the XLE and if there are other add-on packages you want\n* It's okay to ask them to repeat the explanation on a piece of paper\n* And as footloose60 said, you're always able to walk out (but you can do it politely!)\n\nBTW are you sure you want to spend this much in CASH?",
            "You need to be able to say no and walk away. You can walk out with $500 below MSRP or $13,000 below MSRP.\n\nDo the research beforehand and know how much the car is worth, what the dealer invoice price is and if there\u2019s any \u201cadditional\u201d manufacturer rebates or discounts.\n\nThis is probably hardest year to get a discount on a car, they aren\u2019t budging and I\u2019m taking a break till inventory clearance in Q1 2025 for 2024 models.\n\nRefuse to talk financing / lease / cash till you agree on final price of vehicle.\n\nBringing in a car from the USA might be cheaper as well, you\u2019ll need to check the numbers.",
            "You can often get a better deal via finance as the sales guy / dealership gets a kick back. \n\nTake the finance option (as long as you have good credit and can take a credit check hit), then pay it off a week later in full. \n\nYou\u2019ll be told you can\u2019t do this by the finance manager, but you can.",
            "I've had good success with\u2014wait for it: Being nice.\n\nI show up well-dressed. I smile. I butter up the sales rep. I build a good rapport. I make jokes. I laugh at theirs. I try my best to be likeable, because *people are more willing to give you a deal when they like you.*\n\nI never talk down about the car I'm interested in buying, or say that it's worth less than what they are asking. I say that it's a great car, just what I've been looking for. I just can't afford the asking price.\n\nI offer the price I am willing to pay. The sales rep will take this back to the financial manager. He'll come back with a counter offer. Say \"well that is a generous discount from your original offer. But this is all I can afford to pay\" and refer back to your original price. He might go back and forth to the finance manager several times, staying there longer each time, as they move gradually towards your asking price. This is a strategy to wear you down. In reality they are probably just talking about hockey. Be pleasant and keep smiling. Don't show any signs of weakness or impatience, or that you are running short on time. Make it all about your ability to afford, and not about how the car isn't worth their asking price.\n\nIf this strategy doesn't work, you may have offered way too low of a price. Re-evaluate your asking price before moving on to the next dealer.\n\nThe strategy has worked very well for me. I learned it from a retired FBI agent who specialized in negotiating for the release of hostages.",

Tell them you\u2019ll be willing to buy from whoever gives you the best price that week/day.\n\nSometimes end of the month/quarter can be beneficial if they\u2019re behind sales targets. \n\nUse the numbers they give you to bargain against each dealership.\n\nUse \u201call in\u201d pricing. \n\nWalk away if they try and trick you or change the agreed on price.\n\nI did this and bought a 2021 RAV4 XLE for under 39k.",

There is no cool off period in Ontario for example. \n\nDouble check all the numbers. \n\nYou should know what the price of your desired configuration is, with taxes before you walk in to the dealership. So they should be adding is freight/pdi, omvic fee, tire tax, admin fee. Any other addons like warranties are not mandatory.  Know your budget before hand and walk if they\u2019re not playing ball\n\nGood luck!",
            "Say you're not sure about how you're going to pay for it.

            "I am a salesperson for a different manufacturer. \n\nI can\u2019t speak to exactly where Toyota is at in terms of inventory for the RAV4 that you want, but the availability of the car is heavily going to affect what kind of price you will be offered and how flexible they will be with any kind of counter offer. \n\nIf there are multiple vehicles like it on the lot, you should have no problem working out a deal. \n\nIf there is a wait time for the car, you\u2019re likely going to be told something along the lines of \u2018here\u2019s the price, take it or leave it\u2019\n\nYou\u2019ve already done your research and have an idea of what you would like to pay. I would recommend going in, test driving the car to ensure it\u2019s the right fit, and then let them know what you are hoping to achieve. Be straightforward and let them know that if they can achieve your desired price, that you are ready to move forward with the purchase immediately.

Choose all the Toyota dealerships from whom you'd be willing to buy a RAV4.\n4. Print out copies of your summary, one per dealership.\n5. Write a cover letter for each summary. Explain that you plan to buy a RAV4, that you've created a summary from the Toyota website, and that you plan to choose the dealership and sign paperwork on <date>. You need to say in your cover letter whether substitutions are acceptable, and which ones. As the cover letter's call to action, ask for the dealership to deliver a quote by mail. \n6. Mail the letters. Give them enough time to meet your timeline, but not so long that the letter falls down a crack somewhere. You can email but a letter will probably get more responses, believe it or not.\n7. A few days before the date you quoted in your letter, gather up all your responses (probably not very many, but probably more than one). Decide which dealership to go with.\n8. Visit the dealership. If they do anything fishy, walk away and go with dealership number two.

            "Do the email thing first.. since you know what you want.. decide how much your willing to pay and email it to all the dealerships you'd be willing to drive to do the deal (email separately.. find the sales managers name on their website).. , make it a reasonably obtainable amount  (don't lowball or you will just get an MSRP answer in return), you know they are in demand vehicles and you are not going to get a 20% off magic offer on a vehicle you are going to have to wait 6 months to get... dealerships are masterminds as wasting your time if you show up in person.",
            "Great book! His NPR interview on buying a used truck was interesting. Find the black swans!",
            "Haha yes. Same guy. I heard him interviewed on an economics podcast.",
            "Time is money. As in, time spent is money saved. 30 minutes of this saved me $1,000 on my last used car purchase. Does your job pay you $2,000/hour?",
            "Extended warranties can sometimes be useful, and sometimes not, it really depends. Once the 3-year 60,000KM basic warranty runs out, you\u2019re at the mercy of luck. For the next few years, bad things can happen requiring pricy fixes, or nothing can happen at all. Some parts cost thousands, and extended warranty can cover those (I\u2019ve had a power-takeoff unit break once, at a cost of $3,000 plus taxes just for the part\u2026).\n\nFor me, in the past, if the extended warranty offered seemed like a very affordable add-on I would take it, but if it seemed like an overinflated ridiculous price, I would leave it out of the deal.",
            "It definitely is strange that a lot of people tell others not to buy the extended warranty. I\u2019ve been saved many times in the past by having this coverage. And, I\u2019ve also bought coverage I ended up not needing. \n\nSaying yes or no to it depends on up-front costs. If you\u2019re being charged $2000 for an extra 4 years of warranty, take it. If you\u2019re being charged $5000 for an extra 2 years of warranty, decline it.",
            "I find that they try to wear you out.",
            "Thank-you for taking your time to respond, and I agree. :)",
            "Can use any dealer",
            "No. I only meant that for those looking to pay cash or finance, it may be worth looking at what they offer off of MSRP for cash purchases. Financing and paying for it a week later may not get you the best price.",
            "It is illegal, hence why it doesn\u2019t happen. Be wary, there\u2019s a *lot* of misinformation in this thread. Seems typical for this sub when discussing car purchases/dealers/loans/leases, etc.",
            "I just know it exists so I throw out reminders because I sure as hell would be upset to find out later. I didn't even think such a thing existed until a dealer friend told me and I googled it.",
            "And avoid any financing that says \"pre calculated interest\" like the plague.",
            "And then take your car to a different dealer on the other side of the city for service so they can't overcharge you for maintenance to make back the financing loss...",
            "Our Toyota dealership worked with us when we went in to buy with just cash. We paid off the majority of the loan, and then went in with a 6 month payment system just so the dealership got their kickback. The dealership paid the interest. We get a $700 kickback that we can use on tires, accessories, etc. \n\nPissing off the dealership is all well and good, but it doesn't hurt to work with them. Just in case something goes wrong with the car. It never hurts to start out sweet and then turn sour if you need to. Just my 2 cents.",
            "Any way to check for low demand or how long a car has been sitting on the lot?",
            "Yeah they switch you over to their colleagues so much they are tag teaming you and it's so tiring",
            "It can\u2019t exist, it\u2019s illegal. Maybe at a sketchy used dealership.",
            "low demand these days means they have actual units still for sale sitting on the lot."
