But even then it was not really a success, and more of a sinking cost than anything else. The russian government, which was in great financial difficulty and in diplomatic turmoil with the British Empire was envisioning losing their colonies without compensation.\n\nThe second important point was that, at the time, the concepts of nation-state and the auto-determination of the population was a barely burgeoning idea in Western Europe, that had not reached the Russian Empire (has it even now?) and was not a preoccupation for the eager to flourish US government. So selling territories (and the inhabitants) to another countries was still a thing.\n\nTherefore the exchange of Alaska for money between the US and the Russian Empire was a normal (at the time) thing and profitable for both: the russians were making it even financially, while signifying their disinterest for the North American continent to both the British and French Empires ; the americans were taking the territory under the nose of their regular adversary (the British Empire), while surrounding their canadian territories on 2 sides, and diminishing the possible opportunistic attacks on their west coast by reducing the possible development of the canadian west coast ; finally both, already regular allies, were reinforcing their diplomatic proximity.",

They bear the same history as the English in that regard, even moreso because their ancestors (very broadly, of course most Americans immigrated later on but it's about the nations legacy) were literally part of the colonizing effort, moving to a colony and replacing/oppressing the native population. The average poor Englishman who stayed didn't have anything to do with it, only the wealthy, royals and political elite (which still gives the UK a legacy of colonialism, don't misunderstand me). But the audacity of a white American to call the British colonizers is truly astonishing, as they bare literally the same amount of historical responsibility.",

            "Translation: My mind is too tiny to comprehend different things and the concept of converting. \n\nAlso using a variable such as volume as a substitute for weight is dumb.",
            "Everyone knows the only TRUE measuring scale is Big Macs per pickup truck!! \ud83e\udd85\ud83c\udf54\ud83d\ude21\n\nThe lack of accuracy is what gives it that stench of FREEDOM, much like variable measurements such as cups and tablespoons!\n\n/s",
            "There's only three countries in the world that use imperial, why not just convert to metric and then not complain?",
            "I have had to convert or find out which type of cup they mean or how many grams is a stick of butter when baking for years. I find with baking grams is just better, it's precision work, and a cup, a spoon\u00a0is unprecise, if you aren't baking muffins with kids or something simple.\u00a0\n\n\nYes, it's annoying. Which is why I prefer European and Asian blogs for baking and cooking, now that we have them.",
            "We both metric and imperial it\u2019s not that hard with google",
            "It's like a thawed out caveman got access to the internet. Buy a scale you fuckwit.\u00a0",
            "Ounces for liquids alone takes us back to 1870. Fucks sake.",
            "For a country that\u2019s so proud to have invented Google, it always surprises me that they can\u2019t Google \u201c1 kg of flour in cups\u201d. Google will even convert between mass and volume for most substances :)",
            "You guys don't have kitchen scales? It is not costing you a kidney to buy one.",
            "I like how they say \"the country I am from\" to try and remain anonymous as though they could be speaking up for any of a great number of nations instead of the one and only place on the planet where grams aren't a standard cooking measurement.",
            "No, you need a better education system and a basic knowledge on how to Google things like conversion tables",
            "I\u2019ll have a tablespoon of weed please",
            "Fluid ounces are a thing. 4 of them together are my favourite unit of measurement. The gill.",
            "If you know the type of flour is there no issue in finding the density and if you know the density is it trivial to convert between weight and volume. There are countries where most ingredients in recipes are displayed in volume instead of weight and it works just fine.",
            "What happened to penguins per football field, or large boulders the size of several small boulders?",
            "Three? The US, UK and...?\n\nAnd to be clear, here in the UK it is common the know both the metric and imperial systems, but in baking we all use metric.",
            "in the DR they mix both and it\u2019s even worse \ud83d\ude02",
            "Right? Literally takes a couple of seconds to convert units like that, probably about the same amount of time it takes to write that complaint and make oneself look like an idiot.",
            "That's bollocks, has the flour settled, been sieved or compressed? \n\n\nIt is not always going to be the same.\n\n\nWeight is however a constant",
            "Let me just look up the fucking density of flour instead of using metric. It\u2019s just feels more \u2018natural\u2019 and is better for daily use.",
            "I used to be a baker... this has caused me physical pain to read. No, volume is not a valid metric for a recipe if your recipe requires accuracy. If you're happy to just yolo it them sure, but that's not the same as being accurate. Especially when working with large batches and when trying to get a specific quality.\n\nAlso just to take shots at literally every recipe there is:\n\nMAKE YOUR RECIPE USING % FUCKERS, makes up or downscaling way easier. At least for baking. The main ingredient/most prominent is the 100%, and everything else is derivative there of. It means you have to learn percentages, but it's great.",
            "So many vassal states in here crying about nothing",
            "The three official countries are the US, Liberia and Myanmar",
            "us, liberia and myanmar iirc, uk is kind of in a gray area",
            "UK uses both. We're prepared to encounter stupid US measurements \ud83e\udd23\n\nEdit: who decides how big the cup is????",
            "Imagine thinking the whole world should operate just the way country  does , and being offended or perplexed if it doesn\u2019t . You almost want to see the world as they see it to belive they arnt on a wind up",
            "Just to \ud83e\udd13, weight is not constant, mass is",
            "Unless you are baking a 10 story cake, the difference will be barely noticeable.",
            "Yeah, that things are done differently in some countries than it is in your home country is mind blowing, I understand that. There is a big world out there, it can be scary, for both you and OOP it seems.\n\nThe great thing with volume is that you can get the amount you want straight out the container you have the flour in without going past a scale first, as you can scoop it out with the measure itself. Plus, the recipe in question seem to be for bread, not a science lab, therefore is it quite okay if you get a couple of grams more or less.",
            "There are volume measures also in metric. Such as litres and decilitres. Not any problem with writing a recipe in those units.",
            "Ok ive read some of their other other stuff, yes you should be doing some adjustments, bread does sometimes need some manual persuasion. but have you ever made bread day in and day out? Let me give you a personal favourite example of accuracy over yolo.\n\nWe'd make these things called \"twists\", the sweet version is called a [teatime](https://www.bakersdelight.com.au/products/blueberry-teatime/).\n\nThere's 200g of blueberries and some amount of custard (I forget that specific), if you yolo'ed the blueberry content in them you'd get an awful droopy sloppy teatime, too little and it'd be shit because not enough blueberries. Anyway if you go by volume it has a tendency to come out too wet or dry due to blueberries stacking within the cup weirdly. Nobody wants a sloppy teatime.\n\nAlso freebie advice, wanna copy that? \n\nBang out some dough into a horizontal rectangle, put ingredients like cheese and bacon, custard and blueberries, whatever (obviously use a sweet dough for teatimes) \n\nand roll it up like a scroll, top down to the bottom, sealing the seam underneath.\n\nThen just put it on your tray and cut in *most of the way* through with scissors, fold the separated bits apart in alternating directions and square it up nice and neat. Easy peasy.",
            "Huh. TIL",
            "You're not wrong, the other one I find genuinely fascinating are the folks complaining about 24 hour clocks and referring to it as \"military time\".\n\nIt just seems so strange to me - I can't really believe there are people in the world so dumb that counting past 12 is such a challenge for them that they need to complain about it. How is this such a complicated concept to some people?",
            "A recipe should be accurate and provide consistent results.\n\nMeasuring a powder by volume is absolutely not going to provide consistent results.",
            "Have you ever actually baked before. Baking and cooking in itself are a science. You need the correct weights of ingredients to achieve the correct chemical reaction. Being a couple grams off can be the difference in your bread rising and not rising. Volume measurements in cooking are used for liquids, for a reason you need accuracy and the best way to achieve accuracy, especially when measuring dry foods is to weigh them.",
            "A big world that generally does use the metric system. Except for that one edgy country that likes to be different.",
            "It's not so much a hard concept as it is that we have learned the 12-hour clock since we were children, and switching over is a hassle for no real reason. I also suspect that most of us who learned the 12-hour clock would still be converting 24-hour into 12-hour to tell time if we switched anyway. For something that doesn't really matter, there's just no reason to change the standard here.",
            "Are you guys, when you are making bread, seriously worrying about getting the exactly correct amount of grams of flour? Instead of looking at whether the dough is too wet or too dry?  \nA recipe can anyway not correct for that you have the exactly same flour as whoever wrote the recipe. Not to mention that your oven will bake the dough in the exactly same way. Having a look at the dough, both before putting it in the oven and once it is being baked, is quite a good idea.",
            "Yes, I have worked in a restaurant. If you make a lot of bread at the same time is it quite efficient to go by volume. Start with 5L of flour, or whatever the recipe calls for given the amount of bread you wish to make, and then add more water or flour until the dough is just right.",
            "There are volumes in the metric system too. Usually L and dL",
            "Nobody does that though.  Nobody looks at the clock and thinks that it is 14 o'clock, we just see it as 2 in the afternoon. It's a very simple system.",
            "If I make a recipe twice I should get the same results.\n\nIf you are using volume instead of weight, you will not get the same results.",
            "That is litterly the least efficient way of doing it. Just weigh the flour, measure the water, and then combine.",
            "And they are used for their intended purpose.\n\n\nIt's like using a hammer to put a screw in, you can do it but the results will vary.",
            "And those are always the same measurement. \n\nHow the hell am I supposed to know which of the 5 different cups in my kitchen I should use?",
            "Yeah, it's a simple system if you grew up with it. It's easy to see 14:00 and think that when you've seen it your whole life. I've seen 2:00 pm so when I see 14:00 I have to say, oh, that's 2 after 12 so it's 2:00 pm. Ofc it's different when you learn different things. No one said it's hard to change to 24-hour clocks. There's just no real reason for us to make the switch.",
            "If you use the same flour so is 1dL the same as 1dL. If the dough looks and feels the same (which is the important part) and you put it in the same oven, expect the same result.",
            "1dl of flour is not going to weigh the same every time."
