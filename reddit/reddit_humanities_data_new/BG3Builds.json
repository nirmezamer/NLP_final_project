            "Well, here is my first druid build - [Land Druid](https://gamestegy.com/post/bg3/1085/land-druid-build). Any feedback is welcome :)",
            "Looking forward to seeing it!  If you remember, ping me when they go up.\n\nI've been repeatedly shocked by how strong Circle of Spores is.  Probably has one of the smoothest leveling curves in the game.\n\n* Early game it can do respectable damage from the +1d6 necrotic bonus dmg  from Symbiotic Entity, so for instance with Drow for dual handcrossbows or a small multiclass dip for proficiency.\n* Shillelagh means you can be okay at melee without needing to invest in STR or DEX.  And weirdly can empower some multiclass SAD martial or gish builds, because BG3 has a quirk that changes Shillelagh into using the new casting modifier of the first multiclass dip that has spells you take after getting Shillelagh. (Oddly is doesn't change on additional dips, making the mutliclass leveling order a bit tedious...)\n* Lvl 3 you get Moonbeam and Spike Growth.\n* Lvl  5, 6 & 7 you start getting Summons and get Owlbear Wildhshape.   BG3 dropped the concentration requirement on summons making them much more powerful than in 5e, but they still suffer the same 5e issues of making combat take much longer and have the added tedium of pathing issues, annoying NPC's etc.  I understand why they don't get as much love, but they're quite strong nonetheless.\n* Owlbear is so strong at these middle game levels that you don't need Moondruid for it to be great.   And having to use an Action on Wildshaping, as compared to Moon Druid's Bonus Action also isn't bad since Owlbear has some reasonably strong bonus actions you can use on the same turn.   Owlbear tanking for a small horde of summons can carry you through most of Act 2 before it starts to drop off due not having Moon Druid's Primal Strike (Wildshape attacks count as magical damage.)\n* Lvl 9 you get Conjure Elemental, which with the concentration and duration removed, is powerful enough to be worth using even if you don't want to bother summons in general.\n* There's an interesting interaction between Armor Agathys and Symbiotic Entity where they don't overwrite each other special effects, so that one can be used to either protect or refresh and preserve the other.  This could make for some interesing builds as either way to keep a high level cast of AoA viable longer using short rest refreshing Symbiotic Entity charges or helping to protect the +1d6 dmg from a low level Symbiotic Entiry Spores dip. \n\nThis all said, I'm pretty undecided on what the best multiclass dips are for a core Spore's Druid, so it will be fun to see what builds you come up with. Overall I think Spores suffers from being quite good a lot of things, but aside from creating an army of summons that most players won't want to use, it doesn't have obvious ways to being exceptional at any one thing.   And a versatile class that doesn't best handle utility functions like Sleight of Hand or Dialogues is in a very strange place.  \n\nMoon Druid I've had a hard time getting into.   I keep hearing how strong they are in the early game, even for Honor Mode.  But when I try it out, the Bear Wildshape has such low AC they get brutally focus fired.   Maybe that's the strength, they absorb all the enemy attacks with their Wildshape Temp HP, letting your team fight in safety.  But if feels like animal abuse.   :)\n\nI'll be really curious to see if you come up with any strong Land Druid builds.  It hasn't gotten any attention here, but feels like the base Druid kit is strong enough, that there should be some potential with the added spell list and being able to restore spell slots like a Wizard.",
            "Thanks! Saving your comment, for future references :D",
            "Take 4 levels of Thief, 8 levels of Spore Druid, and dual hand crossbows - and you get a toned down version of the 10/1/1 swords bard (itemization is near identical) thats really fun and only slightly more challenging. It's very potent and you get all the Druid goodies. With strange conduit you basically have two built-in damage riders every day with symbiotic entity and detect thoughts. With gloves of dexterity and taking rogue first, you can pump your charisma and take persuasion expertise to be the party face and get great deals at vendors too.\n\nLater on add the band of mystic scoundrel and arcane acuity helmet. Start your turn firing off an arrow of many targets - stacking the acuity to 8 or 10 most of the time. Then throw down confusion or hold person with a bonus action. Then you still have one more bonus action to spare :).\n\nLots and lots of fun staffs encounterd throughout the game to either augment melee more or spell save DC more depending on wanting a more martial or caster focus. E.g. throw the staff of the ram in your off hand to stun whoever is left alive or not confused/held after your first turn if you want to lean in to melee more in the late game."

            "Okay, but not gonna lie that's a pretty funny interaction of enchanted equipment. All the other wizards are giggling at that one guy who used these pieces together and royally crippled himself.  Not me; I'm empathetic. But imagine it in Faerun. \"I've got this sweet set of gear and I'm gong to wreck faces.\" And then it blows up in his face.  It's giving me a chuckle thinking about the risks of magic in much the same way that early game Morrowind has a wizard fall from the sky to his death in front of you. He had created a very nifty Scroll of Icarian Flight that increases acrobatics by 1000 for 7 seconds,  and with it one can leap an astoundingly high and long distance.  But the effect wears off before landing,  and so you die on impact if you use that magic without special care. There's cautionary humor there. \n\nAnyway,  I haven't played with Heat, but I bet you could tinker with your build to get it at least somewhat useful. Best of luck.",

Use Bloodlust Elixirs instead of casting Haste on yourself so you don't have to worry about Heat breaking concentration and making you lethargic. Or have someone else cast the Haste.",
            "Seems you don\u2019t know how to counter the self burning damage\u2026\n\nThe heat mechanic is not the problematic, your itemizations/equipment is.\n\nHellduskarmor, or wavemother\u2018s cloak for example\u2026",

            "Remember that Concentration saves is a subset of Constitution (CON) save. So anything that improves COM saves also helps with maintaining concentration. \n\nResilient feat in Constitution will give you CON save proficiency. To get advantage in CON saves, you have a few ways. See full list in the wiki here:\n\nhttps://bg3.wiki/wiki/Constitution\n\nFor advantage on only Concentration saves, you can use the Elixir of Peerless Focus.",
            "I'm currently toward the end of a HM run with a monoclass GOO Warlock and 16 CON and War Caster have been enough to provide (at least for my standards) an acceptable amount of concentration retention.\n\nIf you really hate losing concentration, there's always the [Robe of Supreme Defences](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Robe_of_Supreme_Defences), which would add your spell casting modifier to all of your saving throws, but it's always felt like overkill to me. Other people have already mentioned various pieces of gear that provide advantage on CON saves or concentration checks which would eliminate the need to take War Caster.\n\nThere are also other ways to improve your chances of keeping concentration. Since the DC of the concentration check is based off damage taken, equipping either of the gloves ([Hellrider's Pride](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Hellrider%27s_Pride) or [The Reviving Hands](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/The_Reviving_Hands)) that provide Blade Ward on your party healer will reduce the difficulty of many of your concentration checks. Similarly, the Bless effect provided by [The Whispering Promise](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/The_Whispering_Promise) (or, you know, Bless), will also boost your concentration saves. General bonuses to saving throws will also help, especially against things like getting knocked prone or being held/paralysed, which will all immediately end concentration without any additional save checks. Similarly, items that just outright prevent these conditions (like [Boots of Striding](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Boots_of_Striding) or the [Ring of Free Action](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Ring_of_Free_Action)) will also help.",
            "\n My best one for that requires several items. \n\n Steel Watch helmet and amulet if health grant advantage on con saves. Same with various armors. \n\n Boots of striding stops you getting knocked prone while concentrating. \n\n  Robes of Supreme defenses adds your spellcasting modifier to concentration saves. \n\n So a Gith sorcerer, any druid or cleric can stack the above togather with the resilient feat and be really hard to break concentration. \n\n Sorcerers dont need the feat.",

That setup makes it a 1/8000 chance you fail a generic 10DC Con save, though higher DC from higher damage will always be a risk. \n\nIf you're not a halfling, the best you're gonna be able to get is a 1/400 chance to fail via an item that gives advantage on saves like Spidersilk Armour and then pump your saves as high as you can get them via Resilient: Con feat, Safeguard Shield/Absolute's Protector, Ring/Cloak of Protection and then any lategame equipment you can grab. \n\nThe absolute best-case scenario for maintaining concentration is an halfling Paladin with Resilient: Con and the Amulet of Greater Health which would give you +6 Con, +4 Proficiency, +3 Aura of Protection, +1 Ring of Protection, +1 Cloak of Protection, +1 Helm of Balduran, +2 Armour of Agility giving a +18 to Con Saves, Advantage from the Amulet of Greater Health and rerolls on 1s from being a halfling.",

Being put to sleep, fey ancestry will prevent this, so will an elixir of peerless focus - this also grants advantage on concentration saving throws.\n\nThe two big ones are incapacitated and prone, incapacitated comes from things like hold person, or paralysis from, say meenlocks or ghouls, also being frightened, stunned, restrained, polymorphic, charmed, and dominated. \n\nYou can become prone many ways, such as slipping on grease or ice - which are prevented by the [[Disintegrating Night Walkers]] and prone is prevented while concentrating on something while wearing the [[Boots of Striding]]\n\nFreedom of Movement is a 4th level bard, cleric, and druid spell which - among other things - prevents magical paralysis. \n\nHeroes feast is a 6th level druid and cleric spell, which - among other things - prevents the frightened conditions.\n\nI mention these two because they are concentrationless \"until long rest\" spells, which means a camp member who is not a member of your party can cast this and you maintain the effects mentioned above",
