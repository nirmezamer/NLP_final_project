There were laws for landlords, but not for platforms. And the platforms didn't go out of their way to cooperate if there was no legal requirement.\n\n\n\nThus the municipalities had to investigate themselves. That position was extremely weak and it required sending investigators to apartments, ringing the doorbell, hoping there's a tourist there who will testify to staying there as a tourist, and then taking that basis to bring the landlord to court. Barely effective, very resource intensive, and only a tiny fraction of landlords faced such an investigation because of it.\n\n  \nThen laws were introduced requiring Airbnb to have the landlord register with the municipality, then record that registration number on his Airbnb account, and then provide all this data back to the municipality including all records of any stays. Around the same time a rule was implemented limiting airbnb renting to 30 days a year.\n\n  \nThis was super effective because essentially all the data is now with the municipality, Airbnb has to abide by the law, and the municipality can essentially just use a two minute Excel filter to see who is breaking the rules, bring it to court, win and indeed the fines are huge. It works well.\n\n  \nSo it all depends on whether there are local laws enforcing Airbnb to cooperate with sharing full data and implementing a license/registration system on their site.

It's easy to not blame yourself for the problems you are contributing to in a foreign land. \n\nTourism may not be the highest money maker (which in Barcelona it very much is, as many of those startups and tech companies are there due to things like ease of connection, international congress', etc. which are all adjacent to Barcelona's toursim industry). But it is one that is having the highest impact on the city and its inhabitants.\n\n>it's way easier to blame the tourists and other foreigners than actually make meaningful policy so....\ud83e\udd37\n\nWell with this policy they're killing two birds with one stone it seems.",

I noticed decades ago that when I visited Europe and told people I was from California they treated me much worse compared to after I moved to New Mexico and started telling them I was from there.   I asked a waiter about it on a recent trip to Barcelona and he basically said:\n\n1. All British tourists are awful across the board with the pleasant/polite ones being the exceptions.\n2. Americans can be awful but it tends to be in patterns by state.  Floridians, Texans, and New Yorkers were the absolute worst.  He claimed New Mexicans and Coloradans were the best and he loved that folks from those states seemed to always know at least a little Spanish.\n\nThis all aligns with what I observed when I lived in Amsterdam for a few years.  The British tourists were consistently so bad that I learned pretty quickly to just avoid going to bars, clubs, and coffee shops on British bank holidays, Americans were a mixed bag and it did largely depend what state they were from (with NYC tourists being the absolute worst consistently).",

And because we tip the best, apparently.\n\nVery consistently called out as the worst?  Texans and Midwesterners.
