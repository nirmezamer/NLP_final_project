        "content": "#Hello, welcome to London!  \n*Visiting us?  Moving to study or work?  Brief layover? Moving to a new part of London? Any small questions about life here, if you're new or been here your whole life, this is the place!*\n\nWe get a lot of posts asking very similar questions so this post aims to address some of our most Frequently Asked Questions, and give you a place to ask for assistance.\n\nYour first port of call should be  \n#[the r/london wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/index)\n\nIt includes sections on:\n\n**What should I see and where are the non-touristy stuff and hidden gems?**  \nWe've written about the big must-sees [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/thingstosee) and we highly recommend [TfL's Experiences site](https://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/visiting-london/experience-london).   \nWe've listed some of our favourite lesser-known stuff [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/secretlondon)\nAnd the cheap/free stuff [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/lowbudget)\n\n**How do I pay for the Tube/bus, and what's an Oyster card?**    \nYou don't pay cash.  You can use a number of contactless payments systems such as your Contactless bankcard (which is widespread in the UK, but maybe not so much elsewhere), Apple Pay, Android Pay, or you can buy an Oyster card and top it up with credit.  See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/gettingaround) for more.\n\n**Where should I live? What's x area like?**  \nHave a look [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/living)  \nIt includes recommended sites to find places to live and rent, and has a section on what particular areas are like.\n\n**How do I get from this place to that place?**  \nUse [Citymapper](http://citymapper.com).  Honestly, we're not shills for them; it's just a really good app and is used by most of the locals on this sub.  \n\n**Is x area safe?**  \nYes. Bad stuff can happen in any large city, but London is generally very safe.  There aren't any no-go zones.  Even under the shadow of terrorist attacks, most Londoners feel safe.  See [our safety page here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/safety) for more.\n\n**Where can I watch the baseball/basketball/football/handegg match?**  \nA comprehensive guide to all London football matches in all leagues can be found at [tlfg.uk](http://www.tlfg.uk). Use [Fanzo](https://www.fanzo.com/en/best-pubs-in-london/3128) to find pubs showing a variety of sports and see our list of other places [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/sport)\n\n**How do I get a UK SIM card for my phone?**  \nAdvice on networks and how to get a SIM card is covered [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/connectivity).  \nIt also includes suggestions of caf\u00e9s and other places where you can get free wifi and do a bit of work.\n\n**Is the London Pass worth it?**  \n[Probably not](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/londonpass)\n\n---\n\nOther subs that you may find helpful:\n\n* /r/LondonSocialClub - Meeting new people for events, activities and/or pints.  \n* /r/IWantOut & /r/UKvisa - Check if you need a visa and how to get one if you want to work here.  \n* /r/LegalAdviceUK - Good for all sorts, especially for questions about landlords and contracts.  \n* /r/UKPersonalFinance - Another goldmine of sage advice.  \n* /r/AskUK - Great for general questions about UK life that aren't specific to London.\n\n---\n\n**Tips for posting:**\n\n**Tell us about you** - If you want us to suggest things for you to do then you need to give us a good idea of what you enjoy. Don't just say \"I like music\", say what type of music. Don't just say you want \"somewhere nice to eat\", say what type of cuisine you like (or don't like). The more specific you are the better, otherwise you'll just get pointed back to the generic guidebooks, blogs and our wiki.\n\n**Tell us your budget** - If you're on a budget then tell us what it is and we can bear that in mind when making recommendations. There's no point in us coming up with ideas for things to do and places to eat if they'll clean out your wallet within the first 5 minutes. Saying you want something \"cheap\" isn't really helpful because what's cheap is entirely subjective.\n\n**Tell us where you'll be based** - Let us know where you'll be staying so that we can give local recommendations.\n\n**Asking about hotels or hostels** - We have homes here so know very little about what the hotels are like. Look on review websites such as TripAdvisor. However, if you say \"I've been looking at these three hotels. Which do you think is the better location?\" then that's the sort of thing we can answer.\n\n**Non-touristy stuff** - There are no secret corners where we hide the good stuff from outsiders! This is one of the most written about cities in the world, so when we want to go to a museum, or gallery, go window shopping, or whatever, we look at the same sources as tourists (listings sites, blogs, etc - see front page of the wiki). \n\n---\n\n^(These weekly posts are scheduled to post each Monday at 00:01.

            "I\u2019m a 19 year old Aussie guy and need help deciding on place to stay in London.\n\nHi, I\u2019m an 18 year old (will be 19 when I go) Australian guy and at the end of this year I\u2019m doing a Contiki tour trip around Europe. At the end of the trip I\u2019ve decided to stay 5 days in London from the 5th to the 10th of December so that I can do some day trips to Bath and Oxford (or somewhere else if anyone has some suggestions!). I am now trying to decide on where to stay. The whole trip is essentially bankrupting me so I\u2019m trying to keep on a pretty low budget. I\u2019ll probably be pretty exhausted as the European tour I\u2019m doing is notorious for a fair bit of partying so when I get back to England I\u2019ll probably be mainly interested in more chill activities like the day trips and looking in shops but I still would like to have dinner and a few drinks in some cool British pubs. It\u2019s also worth noting that I have been to London before so it\u2019s not super essential for me to see all the main tourist sites. Might flight home is early in the morning so it would help to be able to get to Heathrow easily.\nI\u2019ve found a few places in my price range in different areas and need help deciding which will be best.\n\nThe Kings Arms, Ealing:\nRight next to Ealing-Broadway station so I could get the Elizabeth Line into the city centre. However, I noticed that to get the train to Bath or Oxford I\u2019d have to backtrack to Paddington station. It\u2019s cheap, about 415 pounds all up and includes free breakfast which is super convenient. It looks like great accomodation for the price, it\u2019s above a pub so it looks pretty quintessentially English which is also cool. It\u2019s also got really easy travel back to Heathrow. On the other hand, it\u2019s out in the burbs a fair way and from what I can gather Ealing is not a super \u201ccool\u201d place to stay.\n\nThe Crestfield Hotel, Kings cross:\nJust across the road from Kings Cross station which is good for transport links but I\u2019m pretty sure most of the day trips I was thinking of leave from Paddington station anyway. (I\u2019m open to other day trip suggestions). In the city centre which is awesome and I have heard Kings Cross is good area for people my age and close to Camden Town where I have heard a lot of great bars and live music is. However it is a bit more expensive, (about 460 pounds, and does not include breakfast which will cost me a lot more). The accomodation itself is also tiny and a lot worse. It will also be tricky for me to get back to Heathrow.\n\nPremier Inn Hub, Paddington:\nThis would be by far the most convenient for me with regards to transport as it\u2019s close to Paddington station which is where most of my destinations leave from. It\u2019s around the same price as the previous hotel but with the option to add breakfast for a little bit more money. I have heard that premier inns are clean and reliable. However I have heard that Paddington is a bit of a wasteland area with not many pubs or shops or anything around which is annoying.\nI saw another Premier Inn Hub in Marylebone but don\u2019t know much about the area or its transport links, maybe this or another premier inn is a better option.\n\nI also briefly looked at the OneFam Hostel in Notting Hill which was recommended by a friend. I remember Notting Hill being a cool spot last time I visited but I\u2019m not entirely sold on sharing another room/bathroom after the Contiki tour.\n\nWhat do you guys reckon? Any thoughts or recommendations or things to know are welcome.",

Good places for election stories are:\n\n- r/UKPolitics\n- r/UnitedKingdom\n- r/AskUK for your election questions\n- r/GreatBritishMemes for your memes\n\nIf you can find a London-specific angle to the election, though, please do post by all means. Posts that meet our guidance for Rule 1 would be things like the following:\n\n- How possible policies affect London uniquely and specifically, e.g. housing, transport, etc.\n- News about key London battleground seats and how the parties are engaging with them.\n- News about candidates in particular seats (although we'l need balance here).\n- News about any notable election-related events happening in London, such as rallies, protests, or community meetings.\n- Information about hustings, debates, townhalls, and community meetings.\n- Information about organising and campaign in London (again, ideally with balance)\n- AMAs with London candidates ([please contact da mods!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/london))\n\nWe'll be posting our typical megathreads with reminders to register to vote, how to vote, candidates in each London seat, and so on.\n\nIn fact, **[DO IT NOW. GO REGISTER TO VOTE](https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote)** (if you haven't already - doesn't matter if you do it twice!)\n\nStories that would not be ok under Rule 1:\n\n- Prime Minister who lives in London calls election\n- Party leader makes national policy speech from location in London\n- TV debate tonight coming from Broadcasting House in London\n- How this party's policies will increase/decrease the cost of living which is a problem in London\n\nThese are better left to the UK subs.\n\nIf we get completely swamped with election threads we may put a rate limit on them and try and achieve some kind of balance.
