Reddit's universal \\>!Spoiler Tags!< are mandatory when discussing plot details of movies.\n\n3. If you wish to be banned, do any of the following: Be rude, harass, ignore the subreddit's rules, promote your site/blog/article/channel/etc., promote your app/company, or post about a movie you worked on. [This subreddit isn't your link farm.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion#wiki_guidelines_for_self-promotion_on_reddit)\n\n4. Due to Administrators' past actions against this subreddit, we have a ***ZERO*** tolerance policy regarding piracy. You will be banned if you request or share links to full features, if you ask or inform how to pirate, or if you mention a pirating site/app/etc.\n\n5. For Requesting posts:\n  * Use a descriptive title that lets people know if they might be able to help or not\n  * Double check that your request wouldn't be more suitable in one of the subreddits outlined in Rule #8\n  * We require a minimum of 125 characters in the body of the post to ensure quality requests and suggestions\n\n6. For Suggesting posts:\n  * Suggest a single film, and no more than one every 24 hours\n  * Mandatory: Include the Title of the Film in the Title of the Post\n  * Encouraged: Using this format: *Film Name (Year)*\n  * Whet the appetite, don't go into detail\n  * Do not repeat a Suggestion that has been posted in the last 3 months\n  * Don't suggest a Barred Film (listed in the sidebar/wiki)\n  * Only suggest a film you've seen and enjoyed\n  * We require a minimum of 125 characters in the body of the post to ensure quality suggestions\n\n7.

Participate!\n\n---\n\n# Barred Suggestions\nBarred movies mean that no one should use them as a Suggestion. You can definitely reply to a post if someone wants a movie that suits it. These are films that come up so frequently in post discussions that the community at large is aware about their existence and posting about them is just pandering.\n\nBarred Suggests| | | |\n---|---|----|----\n12 Angry Men (1957)|Coherence|Donnie Darko|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind|\nEverything Everywhere All at Once|Knives Out|The Man from Earth|Oldboy (2003)|\nParasite (2019)|The Prestige|Whiplash|\n\n**Pro Tip**: This means these movies are *really* good and you should probably check them out.\n\n---\n#Optimal Use\nThis subreddit shouldn't be used for reviews, blindly suggesting lists of movies or just asking for generally universal acclaimed films. Google can easily supply all of those answers. The best way to use this subreddit is understanding that you're leveraging crowdsourcing to identify an itch to scratch. If you don't know specifically what you're looking for, then a Googled question will answer you.\n\nYou can easily find top Sci-Fi, Horror, Drama and all of the genres with a search. Someone has already asked and answered so many common requests: Top Korean New Wave, Grounded Science Fiction, Universally Acclaimed Movies, Specific Types of Horror or Thrillers; and so much more. The optimal use of this subreddit is when your question requires a human intelligence. Each time you ask for a movie to watch, the replies will be tailored *exactly for you*. Give as much detail as possible for what you're looking for and you'll be surprised at some of the answers.\n\n#If you think you have a generic question, check [the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/wiki/index#wiki_faq).\n\nIf you've begun to trust this community with their picks, we do have plenty of Monthly Round-ups of Best Movies:\n\nTop Movies|

It dawned on me later that American Psycho is meant to be a more serious film and Jim Carrey would\u2019ve sent the movie into more of a satirical direction. I liked this decision. Christian Bale did great as Patrick Bateman. It\u2019s his best role in my opinion. If you haven\u2019t, and you like psychological thrillers, go watch American Psycho.",
