            "The goats were awesome",
            "Jane slapping Thor in the face twice was more cringe than both of these. Domestic violence is not cool and Marvel should have known better.",
            "Ralph Boner should be in Doctor Strange\u2019s place",
            "Secret invasion was so bad. It like they read the comic book story and just decided to ignore all of it and make their own. Often I think the producers, directors and writers hate being on MCU projects and want to wrote their own stuff",
            "I had other things to say that was slightly more intelligent but I will defend this goats till the end. They really weren\u2019t that bad. Goats are funny right now. Some of the screaming wasn\u2019t right but overall I didn\u2019t mind them.  And Monica? Really? Wanda didn\u2019t sacrifice anything other than letting go of her fake children and fake husband. That\u2019s all, the goats weren\u2019t as bad as people want them to be",
            "Will part 3 have the elegant \"Black girl magic!\" line?",
            "I still can\u2019t believe marvel officially got in on the screaming goats meme\u2026.10 years late",
            "Wait y\u2019all didn\u2019t like those scenes? Y\u2019all must be bigoted sexists who hate strong female characters or whatever the kids are using as cope these days",
            "No offence or no means to be sexist, I'm so glad I haven't seen Ms. Marvel or The Marvels. Ms. Marvel just looked like a Love Island type series like it was a series for girls and I didn't think it was meant for a Marvel fan like me. The Marvels looked basically like a feminist film like Madame Web. Just all woman superheroes and had corny humour. Nah, that's a lot of cringe. Apparently Marvel Studios are planning to do an Avengers team where it has so many women and Falcon is the only male superhero. Wtf, they'll lose so much money if they keep at this, they'll lose all the chad nerds especially myself. I like female superheroes like Rescue, Scarlet Witch, Wasp, Valkyrie, Captain Carter, etc. But that's just out of control.",
            "Cleaning up your own mess isn\u2019t a sacrifice",
            "I fucking hate the MCU now, its like the rest of Disney. Absolute garbage.",
            "I like the goats and I'd like them on screen again",
            "We still taking Monica\u2019s line from wandavision out of context huh? Lmao\n\nShe\u2019s literally just saying that anyone who was in a position where they could bring back someone they loved only later having to give that up is in an extremely tough spot and doing so is very difficult emotionally. Yes holding an entire town hostage was wrong, Monica was never condoning Wanda\u2019s actions. Only saying that Wanda\u2019s desperation to keep the love of her life and the new family they created around, even if through questionable means, is something she can relate to and that the people of Westview will likely never understand what Wanda is giving up by letting them go. \n\nJfc it\u2019s not that hard to understand",
            "Bottom right was the worst moment",
            "A number of people don't reading the post is amazing",
            "That\u2019s what Kang wanted \ud83e\udd23",
            "I found the goats funny",
            "I thought the goats were really cute, but I do wish there was more to them than \u201chey remember that sound effect from like 10 years ago from Vine?!?\u201d",
            "I actually love when goats scream like that, I find it pretty funny",
            "I was tired of that ancient goat meme when they did it the first time and really annoyed the second time",
            "That Wandaviaion finale hurt, especially considering where her character goes from there. I think it's weird Monica tries to excuse Wanda's actions. \n\nDon't get me wrong, as a stand alone movie, I enjoyed Multiverse of Madness but I think Wanda's character was flattened and forced to retread a previous character arc of learning to let go. How many times does Wanda have to learn to let go of her ideal life because it harms others?",
            "I feel like Ralph Boehner was just one symptom of a larger issue with the handling of expectations in the series. They built up so many mysteries without having a clear plan to resolve them satisfactorily, which left a lot of us feeling underwhelmed and disconnected from what could have been a much more cohesive storyline.",
            "Thankfully the drax arm is the only cringe thing here",
            "Goats were the Only good thing in thor 4 .",
            "Secret Invasion was an overall badly written show\nDr.Strange MoM underdelivered \nThor Love and Thunder script was weak and overdone comedy trying to recreate Ragnarok\nWandaVision overall a good show but some lame bits like that..Also not really a fan of Monica.",
            "I thought the goats were dumb at first but honestly the longer the bit went on, the funnier it got to me.",
            "The goats were fucking hilarious",
            "That WandaVision one infuriates me to no end. She sympathized with Wanda because she was also dealing with grief, despite terrorizing a town for days if not more. Cool motif, still terrorism bro. WTF?! Who wrote that garbage and expected us to just love it? I hate it so much more because the show started off so cool and different. Then it went stupid.",
            "I feel like most of this fandom doesn't get WandaVision or Monica's line. Even Wanda dismissed the attempt of comorting admitting it was all her fault.",
            "Idk you gotta be pretty tasteless to not enjoy the goats.",
            "Is the bottom right from the solo leveling live action adaptation?",

            "Where\u2019s falcons speech",
            "The goats are GOATs",
            "The goats were the best I couldn't stop laughing",
            "What I hate is that people who constantly point out MCU or other comic book movie \u201ccringe\u201d forget that these came from COMIC BOOKS WHICH INHERENTLY MAKES ALL OF IT CRINGE ALREADY. Time to leave the basements and get some fresh air.",
            "Same here- it was a chore and eye rolls to get through it. I just consider it some alternate universe fever dream.  \nI mean tear down the smart powerful Nick Fury they built up over 20 or whatever movies, and then tear down whatever was left of the power-scale or groundedness with that OP super skrull.  \nAnd did they kill of their one good established Skrull, Mendelssohn?  \nAnd for what?! It went nowhere. There wasn\u2019t even a significant secret invasion.  \n  \nAn overall bigger waste than destroying all the helicarriers in TWS.  \n  \nEdit, with more Secret invasion spoilers: I totally forgot they killed off Robin Sparkles, who was literally waiting for a good moment since Avengers 1. And they had Don Cheadle and totally wasted him also.  \nIt\u2019s so poorly done, it\u2019s inFURYating",
            "To be fair it doesn't seem canon either since Nick Fury runs away to space after he learns not to do that in the show",
            "The irony was that same year season 3 of Star Trek: Picard came out and it pulled off a way better shapeshifter-espionage-trust nobody-conspiracy story than Secret Invasion did.\n\nSecret Invasion should have been a slam dunk, but it never even really tried to be a mystery.",
            "Inhumans is worse.",
            "To me it's just part of the tapestry that is Marvel.  The comics have their share of embarrassing stories/art/moments, and so must the MCU.",
            "Wait, you didn't like discovering that tattoos are in your DNA?",
            "I mean, in their defence, that's how Super Skrull manifests his abilities, like just one arm or leg as he needs it.\n\nStill looked shit though.",
            "I didn\u2019t really hate the transformations themselves but that you can get all avenger powers this easily. It doesn\u2019t make sense at all.",
            "The goats were funny and not the reason that the movie fell short.\n\nI\u2019ll see myself out.",
            "I have severe misophonia so I had to literally skip every part with the screaming goats",
            "I'm starting to believe that line is a holdover from a much earlier version of the script because it really doesn't make sense in context and i want to believe that MCU writers aren't dumb enough to think that loss somehow justifies what Wanda did.",
            "I just see that as a line told to calm down a maniac.",
            "The people you imprisoned, stole freewill, and stole their children from, will never know the pain of you losing imaginary children. That you knew for a few weeks.",
            "I don\u2019t think she actually believes the line, she\u2019s basically hostage negotiating and trying to build a connection with Wanda to get her to calm down and validate her feelings\u2026whether those feelings are \u201cvalid\u201d or not.",
            "Well, yea... That's how I understood it too. It's bad but it does kinda make sense if you squint a bit. Let me explain how I saw it.\n\nSo, Wanda is established as this overpowered witch that can manipulate reality to have the life she always wanted. Yet, she *gives up* all that to free the people.\n\nForget that she was the one who enslaved them in the first place. In a \"might makes right\" point of view, she's actually making a sacrifice so Good can prevail in the end... right?\n\nI mean, I didn't say it was good writing but that's what I got from it.",
            "Well, yeah.  They weren't imaginary to Wanda.  One of Monica's greatest powers is her empathy.  \n\nWhat makes it \"cringe\" is taking this moment out of context of the entire rest of the series, which makes it completely clear how much weight Wanda has put into this \"fiction\".  Yes, to an outside observer it's false and relies on depriving everyone else of their own auto omu, but giving it up is literally the biggest sacrifice Wanda can make.",
            "One of the lowest point...",
            "it makes sense in a \"jesus sacrificed himself for you\" kinda way.\n\nShe saved them from all the horrible shit she doing to them.",
            "Killing vision in infinity war to save the universe, ended being reversed in front of her eyes. Whats more is her attempt and part in the overall effort to save the universe wasn\u2019t acknowledged by everyone as much as those by the others. The event is what led Wanda to the Westview mess in the first place. Wanda\u2019s response makes it clear that she knows they wont care even if they do know because she had made a mistake in Westview. \n\nIts easy to mistake Monica\u2019s line to mean the Hex but this is a cinematic universe which has callbacks to previous entries too. We went from entertaining the new rockstars stretching beyond the known universe for callbacks in movies to suddenly being completely blind with one.\n\nIll die on the hill of people completely misunderstanding Monica\u2019s line.",
            "![gif](giphy|fCY3A6JhIsxu2mk4EM|downsized)",
            "I was so excited for X-Men Quicksilver cameo in the MCU and it was reduced to a Boehner joke.",
            "Clearly this is an unpopular opinion, but I actually thought that joke worked quite well",
            "You\u2019re wrong that was incredibly based",
            "What, you wanted more?",
            "*scream time",
            "The goats were fine. It\u2019s too much Korg that ruined it for me.",
            "Yeah and I didn't find the goats cringe at all. In any case, what's the point of reminding everyone of things they hate other than pure negativity. I don't want to see this shit, and the fact that it's pinned by the mods tells me that I really need to get out of this toxic sub",
            "They were way overdone. People have counted - 48 screams.",
            "That\u2019s fair. It\u2019s accurate to think of them as an \u201caccent of bad\u201d, sort of like a cherry on top of an already not-so-great sundae.",
            "You\u2019re right. He should\u2019ve put the whole movie poster instead.",
            "Indeed, but now go and rewatch the movie. They're annoying first time, unbearable on any consecutive rewatch",
            "But it's so dumb in context, Illuminati it's not an obscure word or concept, after all it's only one of if not the most talked about conspiracy theory in our time, Stephen shouldn't be a stranger to the word.",
            "It didn't even sound clever",
            "Jesus Christ that whole segment was fucking pathetic. \n\nIf they were gonna make a commentary on political officials fucking us over, don\u2019t gaslight us into thinking it\u2019s anything other than money and greed. I still personally think there was some corporate meddling on that part of the show. \n\nSad part is, that\u2019s supposed to be his \u201cbecoming Captain America\u201d moment - and it\u2019s just ridiculously insulting to the character and to us. \n\n\u201cYou gotta stop calling them terrorists\u201d is another one. Maybe don\u2019t have the character perform terroristic acts then.",

            "It definitely was at the time, but with distance from 2018 I honestly find it fine now",
            "Nah that was a fun little moment between a teenage sister and her older brother. Maybe it was a little forced, but it wasn\u2019t out of place by any means. Shuri would say something like that.",
            "No way that line was funny.",
            "And the birth of Korg's people as well...",
            "Everything about her in that movie is so awful, it\u2019s embarrassingly bad",
            "I blocked that out",
            "Disagree - they were way overdone.",
            "[removed]",
            "As a one time joke they would've been probably fine, even if it still a bit cringe to reference a 10 year old dead and buried meme, but they just kept appearing through the movie and each time was less funny than the last one.",
            "Because that's what heroes do.",
            "No need for a part 3. I figured the top 8 should suffice for people to report, if they see these reposts.",

            "Not enslaving people is not a sacrifice, no matter what. Neither is cleaning up the mess you made for people that don't exist",
            "Also it was stated _many times_ in the show that her family are completely real and alive/sentient, so one might understand her horror at having to kill them to free the town she controlled by a horrible ACCIDENT, even though it IS obviously wrong to hold them all hostage. Also her powers were clearly driving her insane before then. It\u2019s not black and white. She\u2019s still in the wrong, but she\u2019s not a complete monster like everyone else here believes.",
            "leave it to a portion of the fandom to have a level of illiteracy and blaming the material for it. Im tired of this discourse about Monica\u2019s line.

So again. Listen to what I am saying. \n\nImagine your life is filled with constant pain and trauma and one of, if not the only good thing, in your life is this one person that you love more than anything. Now imagine they\u2019re suddenly ripped away from you and you could realistically never see them again. Or even if your life isn\u2019t a complete shit show like Wanda\u2019s was 90% of the time imagine a loved one, someone you can\u2019t imagine life without, dying. Then imagine that you\u2019re presented with a magical opportunity to bring them back into your life but it\u2019s at the expense of others. Idk about you but I\u2019d at least be tempted to do what Wanda did, if not follow through completely. \n\nWas what she did wrong? Literally yes, no one is justifying enslaving an entire town. Should she have found a healthier and less destructive way to cope. Also yes, that\u2019s part of the realization she makes during the arc that carried over from this show into MoM. All I am saying is that Vision was one of the few bright spots in Wanda\u2019s life and her soulmate. She saw an opportunity to be with him again and took it. It\u2019s not the act of freeing the town from her mind control itself being hard, it\u2019s what would come with it. She would be losing her idealic life, her partner, and the children she made with him and have to face the reality that she would never see them again. \n\nThis is something that Monica and anyone who has had to deal with a heavy loss in their life can relate to, that\u2019s all that was being said during that ending dialogue from Monica to Wanda.\n\nEDIT: Keep downvoting me, nerds.

            "Honestly I don't care even a little, that said if that's the reason they did it 100% agree and good on them for doing it. Hell that sort of thing should be normalized, do a skin cancer awareness campaign along with it. Not enough people take skin cancer seriously.",
            "This makes no sense.  Why would wolverines have bear arms, they're not even the same animal.",
            "Corridor Digital discussed this in their most recent episode of VFX React",
            "I mean I'm glad hes taking care of himself but can someone explain why sunscreen wouldn't work? You have a whole ass crew on films is there a reason having somebody with banana boat on the sidelines wasnt possible?",
            "Even if it wasn\u2019t for that but because of the \"backlash\" against sleeves, so what?\n\nThe problem with most CGI nowdays is that the production don\u2019t actually plan thigs and go in with a \"we'll fix it in post\" mentality (like the time suits in End Game) but there was a Wolverine costume made and they shot the movie with it. So them using CGI to fix up the costume a bit during editing isn\u2019t a problem for me since there really isn\u2019t an alternative for it besides reshooting the whole movie, or atleast Wolverine scenes.\n\nWho is actually mad about this?",
            "Jack for Hugh, Man.",
            "I mean a chunk of it was filmed on studio lots, so I wouldn't be surprised if he's sleeveless in all the scenes that were a set and/or green screen and all the scenes they filmed outdoors he's got the sleeves",

            "The corridor crew guys suggest the CGI is actually the suit. It would explain why in the trailer he has short sleeves but had long sleeves in the early photos. They changed their mind and altered the look of the costume in post",
            "When I heard that I was actually happy. What's a little more gci? Even better if it's for health reasons. I am just glad we are getting another Deadpool movie.",
            "If that\u2019s the case I don\u2019t have a single issue with that and anyone who does is an asshole.",
            "I also thought that",
            "But his face is exposed?",
            "Oh please god don\u2019t CGI his arms. Just let him wear sleeves. We do not need cartoon arms all over the joint.",
            "Is there a hole in the ozone layer where they were filming?",
            "Is he that sensitive?",
            "Or he could\u2019ve just worn sunscreen or they could\u2019ve kept the sleeves on",
            "Super hero movie filled to the brim with CG to the point where you could argue entire scenes are animated; somehow I'm suppose to get worked up by this?\n\nNext you'll tell me Deadpool's mask isn't actually that expressive.",
            "Thank you for explaining it. I was a little confused, I didn't know he ever had skin cancer",
            "Oh, but I can tell you one thing and it's a bit of a secret. In the sequel, we're gonna have Cable. Amazing character. Bionic arm, time travel. We have no idea who we're gonna cast yet but it could be anybody. We just need a big guy with a flat top. Could be Mel Gibson, Dolph Lundgren, Keira Knightley, she's got range, who knows? Anyway, big secret, ssshhhh. Oh and don't leave your garbage all lying around. It's a total dick move. Go. Chicka-chickahhhh.",

            "Here, check it out. She's sending away for all these colorful clinic brochures. I'm sure they're all FDA approved. Chechnya, isn't that where you go to get cancer? You got China and Central Mexico. You know how they say 'cancer' in Spanish?",

            "It's a bot who activated for mentioning he who I will not name. It rhymes with beddrool",
            "I\u2019m not implying anything. Sunscreen only really reduces your chance at certain cancers by about half, which is still great, but there\u2019s also dog shit chemicals in sun screens. I live in Florida and it\u2019s 85+ for ten months out of the year and I\u2019d rather wear a light sun shirt if I\u2019m gonna be out in the sun longer",

            "Yeah, it's like.... Ok.... A man, deep asleep, is suddenly woken  by a puddle of his wife's beddrool, which he momentarily dreamt were kisses, from his coworker crush. No one likes to awoken by beddrool.",
            "The madlad did it. He used beddrool in a sentence just to not say Deadpool. Wait. What have I have done"
