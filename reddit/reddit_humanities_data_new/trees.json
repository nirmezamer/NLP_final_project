No traceable CBD. 99% THC pretty much.\n\nBut I digress from my rant with saying that, overall, the joint OP has is way better for him.

I also got all my kicks from bricks for many, many years, and the stuff I smoke nowadays would hit OP like a ten strip out of Bob Weir's personal stash :P\n\n I've always needed it medically though, and the higher the cannabinoids (thx auto spell!), and terps etc the more medicinal it is so, I kept up with the times out of necessity. If you guys like to trip, get a little gram or a preroll of some 30+ % and you'll see what I mean lol. Alternatively, there's stuff like Rick Simpson Oil which keeps the THC relatively low but has plenty of the good Rx stuff if you and the mrs ever need it down the road. It's fairly easy to make at home too (I make it for my senior mother and with how bad her RA is she can't get around w/o it), so if it's legal where you are that's always an option too and I have to tell ya, after so many years of \"pitch n ditch\" being the only thing we could grow, it's awfully nice coming home from work and smelling those babies legally growing at home, and with all the love i want/ can afford to give them. It's a fun hobby if not for anything else, even if they look more like little shrubs than the big ol 7' seedy monsters we used to grow in the woods back in the day that'd be half eaten by the deer come harvest time.

This art piece is trying to depict characters from adventure time, I believe that objectively it does so poorly for the main character in the center of the piece. Is it still art? Sure.\n\nI wasn't being literal when putting quotations around artist, of course they are still an artist, anyone who makes anything can be considered one.",
            "Okay, how about this. This particular art piece is attempting to depict characters from adventure time. It does so objectively poorly for the main character in the center of the piece. Whether or not it is still 'good art\" remains up to you.",
            "No. You can clearly tell who the characters are, or at least I can. It looks like it\u2019s *supposed* to be a nightmarish interpretation of the characters. Just a different art style. \n\nTo the quality of the glass itself, it looks fairly well made, and easily smokable. Personally I like clear glass pieces myself, but a lot of people out there like their colored/artsy/cartoonish glass and this is something an Adventure Time pot head would have in their collection. \n\nLooking at their other pieces, they look very pricey but also pretty well made so it isn\u2019t like it\u2019s from a bad glass blower. Maybe they just wanted to try their hand at making a cartoon character piece or trying to learn new techniques/styles."
