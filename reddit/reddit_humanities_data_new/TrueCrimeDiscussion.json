        "content": "I live in Albuquerque and work in a hospital.\n\nLast year, a detective came in to question one of our patients who had been shot. Because I am a true crime nerd and had done a lot of reading about this case, I couldn't resist asking the detective about the West Mesa case (In 2009, the bodies of 11 sex workers were found in the West Mesa in Albuquerque, NM).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Mesa_murders\n\nI showed him I didn't have a phone on me and that I was just wearing scrubs and assured him I was just curios. I made sure he knew that if he talked to me about it... There would be absolutely no way for me to prove the conversation happened.\n\nI asked flat out \" Do you think Lorenzo Montoya killed those young ladies?\". The detective smiled and said \"I can't give any names, but I can say that I believe the person who committed those murders is no longer alive and I personally consider the case closed\".\n\nNow you can believe me or not. I don't have any proof. But you can check my profile to see I do live in ABQ and I do work in a hospital. I swear on my daughter that this interaction happened.\n\nLorenzo Montoya is 100% the person who committed those murders. He was caught red handed murdering a sex worker. He had had a sex worker in his trailer. The sex worker's boyfriend/pimp had grown concerned because the date was taking so long. When he pulled up to the home, he found Lorenzo loading up the body of the sex worker in his car and proceeded to shoot and kill Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo was killed in 2006. The pimp was never charged with a crime for killing him. The bodies of 11 sex workers were found in the West Mesa in 2009. All of the women had been killed prior to Lorenzo's death (between 2001 and 2005). And the site where the bodies were found was less than a mile from Lorenzo's home.\n\nOn top of all this, the following video was found at Lorenzo's home:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dZSEY06eyo\n\n\nAccording to police, in the full video Lorenzo is having sex with a woman. Then the video abruptly cuts to the footage linked above like the sex video had been taped over.\n\nIn the video, you can hear someone doing something with trash bags and duct tape. The sex worker Lorenzo was caught red handed murdering had been wrapped in trash bags and duct tape. Some of the bodies that were found in the West Mesa also showed signs of being wrapped in duct tape and trash bags.\n\nThere is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Lorenzo committed those murders. And that was the case even before I had this conversation with the detective. Albuquerque Police still consider the case \"open\". Every few years they will have a press conference and ask the public for information. But it is pretty clear no one is working the case and they also unofficially consider it closed.\n\nAnother thread prompted me to make this post... So I just thought I would share. I know this has major \"My dad works at Nintendo\" vibes. But if I had any proof... There's no way the detective would have talked to me. So it is what it is!",

Of course he is familiar with the case and has opinions. Professional and personal. \n\nI\u2019m sure he likely would\u2019ve agreed with you in a vague round about way no matter what you said.

            "There wasn't really anything the detective would be trying to \"work\" when the conversation took place. \n\nI spoke to him in the hallway of the hospital I work at at about 2:00 AM in the morning. He was checking on a patient who had been shot, hoping he was able to answer questions about the shooting. \n\nIt was just the detective and I in the hallway. I'm pretty confident the detective was being honest about his feelings on the case with no ulterior motives.",
            "I hear you and get where you are coming from. But I don't think that's a fair comparison. \n\nThere are over 10,000 special agents in the FBI. And they are spread all over the United States. \n\nThere are likely only, at most, a couple dozen detectives in Albuquerque. And they are all located in this one medium sized city. I think an Albuquerque detective is a lot more likely to know a bit about the most famous unsolved murder case in their city than an FBI agent is to be familiar with the DB Cooper case. \n\nThat being said... If you had the opportunity to pick the brain of an FBI agent about something you were interested in that they may have knowledge of... Wouldn't you take it!?",

I live in a much smaller town, and actually know a lot of cops(mostly in the have mutual friends sense), and my dad is a criminal court judge. I totally get it. \n\nJust saying, I really do not think he would have spouted off to anyone other than very vaguely. I just meant that plenty of FBI agents are willing to talk about DB Cooper (an often discussed and very popular unsolved true crime case) and give generic and vague opinions. Very few will go into specifics.",

You're right that it was just his opinion. \n\nThere's no way he would say anything like that to the media or in an official capacity. The department still officially considers the case open.",
            "There are lots of different types of detectives. There are vehicle theft detectives, fraud detectives, sex crime detectives, detectives that investigate crimes involving the elderly, detectives that focus solely on retail theft... And many other kinds. \n\nI am pretty sure the detectives that actively work on murders and violent crime are a pretty small community in Albuquerque. And I'm positive they all talk to each other. \n\nAnd this cop was there to interview someone who was shot and almost killed. He would have been part of that small community."

            "There was this one case... They recently identified the woman whos body was found. Now I am no policeman or anything and I only had available infro from the report which was made public but it was a case of missing woman, her body was found in cloth from psych. Hospital, suppossedly she was put there by someone that came on some sort of van. There is more on the website but im honestly not sure where I found it. Ive read the case.\n\nThe body belonged to young woman who was overdosed and thrown out close to graveyard.\n\nSo whats the catch you might ask... Well in the report from 19... something it said the killer was suppossedly a schizoprenic patient because of the pills she got (at least I hope I remember she was overdosed with them...) anyway. \nThey blamed a runaway patient.\n\nIve checked the hospitals in the area, by the time the body was found there were quite a few hospital active. The lady was missing a while before her body was found from a city not so far from the one she was found.\n\nFirst thing off was: why would they assume it was a patient? If hospital had a missing patient they would report it :D unless it was a mistake on the personals side and they didnt wanted anyone to find out which more or less makes them all guilty. Second, lets say it was one of the patients, nobody noticed him missing... But im very sure they would notice a missing car. Even if the car was not owned by the establishment Im sure someone would report the car stolen and im very sure the person that stole the car wouldnt just return it but again, thats just simply what I have from the report there were no additional reports... back to the topic. She was wrapped in a clpth which was used at the hospital, sure patients could grab one of the sheets or whatever it was but again, how could patient get to the laundry room? Even if it was from their bed, there would be sort of dna, right? \n\nAnd now we have the pills. I am no expert, I dont know how it functions in such places but I am 100% sure a schizoprenic patient wouldnt be able to hoard enough medicine to overdose someone. AND if they even had a way to get to the pills, im really confused why would they decide on schizoprenic pills instead of the wide variety the unattended cabinet of drugs could offer. \n\nThere was something about grass seeds or whatever also but I dont remember what that was but its very important for my theory. :D\n\nSo, what I think happened is, one of the personel did it. Probably someone with undiagnosed schizoprenia. Why do I think that? Because of the meds. A worker could get his hands on the big stash of meds inside psych hospital.\nThe lady went missing I think couple months or year... before her body appeared. So im 100% sure there was no way a random patient did that and happened to catch a missing lady and unalive her while making sure she was put somewhere \"safe\".\n\nAnd another \"so what happened\". Lets say lady met a friend, Im not sure how was her relationship with family but well. There wasnt much in the report about any physical injuries if I remember correctly. So she came with him willingly. Or at least the report missed on that. Now here comes the grass seeds or whatever part. If I was a runaway from psych hospital I for damn sure wouldnt grab someone and bring them home to my basement or shed (I assume that is where the seeds were from or whatever it was). I would have to be swift an efficient with my kill. I dont remember there being anything about the lady being raped so I doubt thats what happened. She was held somewhere. Either basement or shed... And well, she started being difficult. The one that kept her clearly disliked the idea. (Reminder there was no ransom or anything, she just disappeared) drugged her, unalived her, wrapped her in a cloth. All simply in the heat of the moment. Also, lets be realistic having full bottle of meds that could kill you? What hospital would do that? (Thats why I think it was one of the workers.) Okay, back again. And then drove her to the graveyard. Because in the end he felt upset about what he did and thats why he brought her there so she could be found. (Lets consider he could throw her out wherever, bury her in a forest, let her get eaten by wild animals,...) \nAnd I dont assume its a he but could be considering moving body around involves great strenght but ladies are strong too... I just find it easier writing \"he\"\n\nEither way, if any of you know the case please let me know lol, im really curious about it and cant find it for the heck of it... Either way thats my theory at least. It just doesnt add up for it to be a patient and im sure they know it damn well.",

I bet she's got a lot of things she doesn't want the police and public to know about. I'm sure she has plenty of reason to lie and act strange. None of that's evidence of conspiracy to commit homicide. \n\nSo maybe they did high felony drugs together. Maybe they did some highly wild sexual things that she had pictures of. She probably had tons of evidence that she was stalking Chris and his family, and to be fair there's at least some reason for that given his lies. She probably said bad stuff about his family that nobody would want read in front of the public. \n\nThis whole thing with Chris Watt's mistress is no different than how Alex Jones convinced people that Sandy Hook was a false flag. There's always going to be loose ends that seem odd and don't add up and don't give the full story. The public doesn't have a right to the details of her private life because of what Chris Watts did.

Out of the thousands of names and suspects considered over the years, even with dedicated \"armchair detectives\" involved, Joseph DeAngelo's name never surfaced during the entire investigation. He wasn't remotely on the radar. Both the genealogists who eventually identified him as a suspect and Paul Holes have discussed this extensively. Without that familial DNA match, DeAngelo's DNA never would have been collected and tested, and he would never have been caught, charged or convicted. \n\nWhen the genealogists narrowed down the suspects, Paul Holes initially believed it was the other suspect and concentrated on him, thinking the DNA collected from their trash would match. He wanted to be ahead of the investigation. However, he was wrong, and it turned out to be DeAngelo, who was the other suspect and whose DNA they had also tested from his trash thinking it would rule him out. \n\nThis case, including the original and prior police investigations, and the methodology used in the cold case investigation, has been thoroughly analyzed and broken down so other law enforcement agencies can apply the same techniques to solve cold cases.

Yet there is zero evidence for this. \n\nI don't think it's a sex trafficking ring at all. Why would a Mexican cartel sex trafficking ring traffic American women? Cartels don't really like to mess with Americans unless they have a very good reason. It draws too much attention. \n\nAnd why would a Mexican cartel kill all of these women at different times- but go through the effort of dumping the bodies right on top of each other in the desert of Albuquerque?\n\nWouldn't the victims most likely be Mexican if a Mexican cartel was trafficking them? All of the victims were American and all of them except one were from NM. One of them was from Texas- but she was working and living in NM at the time of her death. \n\nThe whole sex trafficking angle strikes me as fear mongering about sex trafficking conspiracies and it is disappointing that it is taking the focus away from Lorenzo Montoya...

            "Well, because there's no body, no crime scene, and no concrete evidence found during the property search, the case is complex. The search turned up only letters and personal items pointing to an affair, which he admitted to. There's no DNA evidence of violence in the truck, nor any of Patti's DNA anywhere in it, including the truck bed. Additionally, CCTV footage shows her leaving the parking lot in her own vehicle, so there's no proof she got into his truck.\n\nSo, while it's highly likely he killed her, what can they use against him? Having an affair and borrowing a large amount of money aren't illegal. They can't even prove he was the last one to see her since she left in her own vehicle, and no other independent witnesses can place them together after she left work that night.\n\nIn cases where someone has been convicted without a body, there has to be some other independent evidence that a crime occurred and was committed by the accused. Here, all they have is the affair and the money. While Patti told her sister about the trip, that doesn't mean much since it can't be proven to have happened. The situation is further complicated by the fact she took nothing with her for the supposed trip. Her sister says this was because he told her they'd buy everything while there and to keep everything secret, but it still means there's no evidence of a trip together.\n\nHis coworker and wife both provide alibis for him. The coworker says they went to Burger King together right after work, claiming he had no idea if anyone was in the truck bed, though the theory is she was already back there. His wife and other witnesses confirm he was in the area the rest of the weekend, not on any trip or out of the area.\n\nWhile it's frustrating because he seems guilty of doing something to Patti, and it\u2019s possible his wife was involved or helped destroy evidence, there's no proof of anything actually occurring. We can't imprison someone for such a serious crime without any proof, even if it feels obvious that he did it. Our justice system is set up to avoid false imprisonment, though it doesn't always succeed.\n\nSo, to answer your question, this is why nothing has been done despite strong suspicions about who did it.",
            "Because it's all he said she said, there's no evidence for any of it. There's no proof she ever gave him money, there's no paper trail she took it out in cash.

They then looked up these individuals online, gathered personal details, and posted them, asking for opinions. This wasn\u2019t limited to the \u201cyearbook detectives,\u201d doing this but they were definitely the most prominent ones to do so. Maybe also the ones who signed up for things like newspaper.com and did the same thing. Sometimes they were the same people. \n\nI disagreed with it then and I disagree with it now. This happens a lot in unsolved cold cases, where someone innocent gets their name put out because an armchair detective has convinced themselves it\u2019s the suspect. Just about a month ago on Reddit, I saw someone post a photo of a random man they seen at the DMV asking if people thought it was Jason Derek Brown from the FBI's most wanted list. It might have even been this very sub, to be honest. \n\nWhile the more respectful groups and users didn\u2019t engage in this behavior, some still did.

But correct me if I'm wrong, didn't both the truck driver and another motorist identify specifically a young girl walking on the road? IIRC the truck driver also used his radio to warn other trucks on the road to watch out for a child. \n\nIt's true none of that makes it impossible it was mistaken identity. But it does narrow down the pool of who else it would've had to have been to a very, very small pool of children around that age in the area who were possibly wandering around on a road at 4am in a storm.

Several witnesses also confirmed seeing her clock out and leave the plant and that\u2019s where we end up. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think this fact changes anything significantly. It still doesn\u2019t prove or disprove whether she entered his truck bed, as no one has reported seeing her do so, and as you mentioned, there\u2019s no footage of it occurring.

IMO, that is unconstitutional, no matter how guilty the person is. I feel that double jeopardy laws should apply across state, federal, and military court levels.",
            "Do u remember what kind of crime he committed?",
            "You\u2019d have to upload your DNA to an open source site. The police can\u2019t go looking for it in Ancestry or 23 & Me. \n\nAlthough, they can, apparently, search the private databases to look for info to identify a Jane or John Doe.",
            "Just never use 23andMe, their data security is shit and the entire DNA profiles of their clients gets leaked at least once a year",
            "Never trust 21 and Me...they are ALL part of a global effort to build a dna profile on as many members of the human race. Your DNA can be accessed by Law Enforcement, insurance companies, unknown science and medical research, etc. Stay off the DNA grid.",
            "Yes! That podcast is what prompted my question and where I learned most of the details of Lindy Sue Beichler\u2019s murder.\n\nI also looked it up and she lived near her killer for most of her life. But it\u2019s unknown if they ever actually met.\n\nThey were born at the same hospital, lived a mile away from each other growing up and went to the same high school (he was one year older than her). Then after high school, they ended up living in the same apartment building (which only had 4 units).\n\nSo they could\u2019ve passed each other at a school dance, in the high schools hallways, walking to school, etc.\n\nBut it\u2019s not known if they ever met each other. Idk, it\u2019s just wild to me that she may have not known who he was, yet they were so close to each other physically many times.\n\nThen the way I imagine it when she was killed, he probably knocked on her apartment door, maybe she recognized him (or maybe she didn\u2019t), she opened the door (there was no sign of forced entry) then he raped and killed her.\n\nThen he just went off to live a regular life, getting married and living crime-free.",
            "From the article on Nicky Verstappen:\n\n\u201cJoos Barten, the founder of the camp Verstappen disappeared from, was extensively questioned by police in the days following. A former headmaster of the local primary school in Heibloem, Barten had had convictions for child sexual abuse and admitted to being near the tent Verstappen slept in at 6 a.m. on 10 August. During the search for Verstappen, he pointed several times in the direction where the body was eventually discovered. A 15-year-old girl who had attended the teenagers' camp on De Heikop a few days earlier suspected that she had been sexually abused by Barten in her sleep. None of the camp staff were officially held as suspects.\u201d\n\nHow in the actual fuck was a man convicted of child sex abuse allowed to start a summer camp for children???",
            "Statute of limitations (SoL) serves a legitimate purpose. It could be limited in its application \u2014 murder, rape, etc could have no limitations. But imagine if I filed a report that you walked in my store 15 years ago and stole something. \n\nIt was 15 years ago so I don\u2019t have any security video anymore. The only other co-worker who witnessed you committing this crime died so can\u2019t testify, but I CLEARLY remember you doing it because I was there. \n\nNow, 15 years later you are arrested\u2014 and you have to defend yourself. You have zero access to evidence to prove your innocence. No recordings from that day to show you weren\u2019t in the store. You can\u2019t talk to the cashier who might have been able to say \u201cno that\u2019s not the thief I saw that day,\u201d etc. \n\nThere\u2019s less opportunity to gather evidence and witnesses become unavailable or even worse could be a witness whose memory has evolved over 15 years \u2014 adding in facts, filling in gaps with biases or false recollections. If there\u2019s no statute of limitations there would be a lot more innocent people in jail. \n\nHowever, there could be exceptions for serious crimes\u2014 or certain types of evidence. If you match DNA in a rape case even after the SoL then put em in jail if the prosecutor thinks they can get a conviction just on the DNA.\n\nSome states have come up with a creative solution when they develop the criminals DNA profile from the crime scene they file an arrest warrant against the DNA profile. The SoL is then satisfied because charges were brought within the timeframe \u2014 but it\u2019s only going to lead to an arrest after they identify the person the DNA belongs to, even if that\u2019s after the SoL would have expired.",
            "yes but u didnt actually answer the question either",
            "I just listened to the 48 Hrs podcast on this! They had her saliva and bite mark and finally matched the DNA to her. It was great how they presented it to her too. She had thought she\u2019d gotten away w/ it. It was sweet to hear her panicking when they told her she was being arrested.",

However, I struggle to understand why some are so opposed to it, I follow a lot of doe and cold crime cases that would easily be solved if a dna database was available.

            "\u2026.Right. Because I don't know anyone who was caught by DNA evidence in a cold case years after the fact within my own personal life, all I could do is mention cases where the information I would post is publicly available.
