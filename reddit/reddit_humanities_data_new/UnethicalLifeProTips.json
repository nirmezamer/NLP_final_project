Could this be done realistically or would they likely extradite me back to my home country? Also if those crimes do not land a large incarceration time, then what other crime could I commit that would land me in a Finnish prison?\n\nAnd this is totally not a cry for help I swear lol.

I also had to sign an agreement that I am not allowed to complain at all or I would face corrective action\n\nI work a specialized technical position in a building which staffs 12 full time management positions, and two technical positions. They tried to shut me up when I brought up an issue, by trying to make me report my hours instead of helping in any way. I had an issue with this, since no other salaried employees were required to prove their hours, and I politely refused. I told them it seemed like they wanted to discourage me from bringing problems up in the future, and felt like they were targeting me. \n\nThis EXPLODED and ended up with me in extremely hot water, in a room with four management staff. I won\u2019t include details, but jealousy/pettiness took it to an ugly and personal place. My effort and attitude is nothing short of A+, and I am very very happy with my work, but they would rather fixate on my hours in the building.\n\n\n\nNow, 10 months later, they hired a supervisor over my head, and my new boss requires me to log my projected schedule at the beginning of the week, AND a log of my hours for the past week. He said this will be indefinite, and I am still the only person expected to do this. I will face corrective action if I refuse.\n\nAs a salaried employee with a robust set of specialized skills, they are taking advantage of me by comparing my hours to theirs and using it against me. I work up to 12 hours a day, sometimes 7+ days a week, and occasionally have very light weeks. My job is rapidly changing every day, with a TON of pressure to do everything right the first time. Also I am not entitled to any overtime in any way (I used to be, but they changed it.)\n\nI\u2019ve been told by the highest authority here that my job is easier than everyone\u2019s, and it\u2019s not fair that sometimes I get shorter weeks, while they have to work Monday-Friday, 8-5. I was told this by 3 other superiors as well in the meeting, and was also called greedy, which I never will get over. It\u2019s clear they will use these hour logs against me. I think they will try to move me to hourly pay, and I want to make it absolutely ridiculous on the timesheet and skew their perception (and to be super passive aggressive. I would rather be terminated than quit)\n\nOn top of my 40 hours, I have added 3 hours to each day to play videogames on my laptop at my desk.

            "So if it were me, I\u2019d go see an employment lawyer. IANAL, but have pretty substantial experience in salary disputes both as an employer and as an employee. \n\nFYI, if you are in the US, just because you are salary, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the company is not liable for overtime. If you are not substantially able to control your own schedule, this might open an avenue to lots and lots of missed back pay the the company has to pay you for. \n\nComplying with their demand to document your time might fuck them over hard. For several reasons. \n\n- It documents the hours that you are working, setting up an airtight argument for how much overtime you are owed. \n- If you don\u2019t have your own records of hours worked before this, a court will often accept evidence like late night emails as proof that this has been your normal schedule for some time. As a result, you might be able to get back pay for the entire time that you have worked in this role, using the hours that you have documented on your timesheet as an average going back to the beginning of the start of your current responsibilities. \n- In some cases, the business may have to pay you a penalty for underpaying you in the first place, which might be as much as an additional 50% of the total. \n- If other workers are working similar hours, but not being required to report time, a labor investigation might mean that the company might be required to pay them back pay with penalties as well. \n\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n- It might be a really good time to make sure that you are working as hard as possible, and documenting it extremely well. It could impact your total payout, if you catch my drift. \n- Find the best employment lawyer you can, and book a consult. If they are interested in taking the case on contingency, you know it\u2019s a solid case. It might cost you a few hundred dollars for the consult, but it\u2019s worth it to know where you stand. \n- Your lawyer might be able to give you a script to follow, or send a letter himself, that sets up a strategy that extracts a sizeable settlement without going to court. \n- If you play your cards right on the settlement agreement, anonymous complaints to the department of labor could be a thing to consider after your check clears. If they are investigated, and then have to pay years of back pay and penalties to multiple employees, it could be a business ending event. \n\nGet a lawyer that has litigation experience, and sharp teeth.
