What I put in the text about the date isn\u2019t even everything that happened. She told me she was looking for something serious and was really into me then discussed trying to decide whether to marry her ex fianc\u00e9 or not several times during the date. Anyway, she ghosted and didn\u2019t contact me again until she realized she lost an instagram follower lol ",

Dude asked me out, we go to dinner and he ordered tequila + Kahlua \ud83e\udd22shots for himself along with a bunch of different sushi rolls.  I had a glass of wine and a smaller sampling with miso soup.\n\nBill comes \u2014 and I\u2019m completely not opposed to going in halfway (or taking care of the tip, at the least) \u2014 he takes it, puts a $20 bill inside and hands it to me, saying nothing.   \n\nI was ~20-21 at the time, nowhere near as assertive as I am nowadays.  I pay the remainder, which was something like $80.  I had a little moment with the waiter throughout that meal and as absurd as this is, I left my number on the check, not exactly expecting him to call, but it was my silent f*k you to the guy next to me.\n\nI don\u2019t even bother following up with the guy post-date, and i did not respond to his \u201clet\u2019s make plans for Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d text.\n\nValentine\u2019s Day comes, I was a cocktail server at the time.  The guy came into the bar/restaurant where I worked, complaining about how \u201cwe had plans\u201d and that I broke said plans, how could I?, the whole bit.\n\nHe then goes to a nearby booth and SULKS with chin in hands, almost to the point of crying.  I told my manager/owner about the situation - he and I were good friends - and he sort of chuckles, asking me how I manage to scramble guy\u2019s brains and/or find the weird ones.\n\nHe walks over to sulking guy in the booth (I\u2019m within earshot), gives him some water and offers him a sandwich.  Guy accepts it, and proceeds to eat this sandwich while wallowing in his misery and rejection, periodically catching my eye with the most pathetic look on his face.  \n I wanted the floor to eat me up; it was such a mortifying shit show \u2014 although nowadays the whole experience is comical to me.\n\nNever heard from him after that, but damn.  He was a strange one.\n\nEdit:  My friend gave the guy the sandwich for free and I asked him why he did that instead of ushering him out or something.  He told me a sandwich was worth watching the shit show unfold.",

I was hyperventilating trying to take my clothes off...

Had to take transit home for about a hour I was the weirdo with his head out the window like a dog.\n\nWhatever it was gave me weird side effects for months I actually had tunnel vision for a long time periodically and extreme headaches, finally months later it stopped it was a fucking  nightmare.

Grabbing the flower off of the mother stem can be heated up and that\u2019s it- no need to grab the flower and melt it, and include all these additives etc to create something else, hash in my opinion is a drug, weed is the basic derivative or hash. \n\nYou can literally make weed tea the exact same way you\u2019d made chamomile tea so how come one is \u201ca drug\u201d and the other isn\u2019t?

Smoked another fat bowl at the end of class before stumbling out into the crowded hallway between class; my gf at the time found me and i was soo fucked up for a few minutes she didnt know what the fuck i was on.  \n\nBut i was fucked up a lot at school so it wasnt all that out of the ordinary for me.

And i was one who actually used to enjoy realling pushing the limits and didn't even really mind having a bad trip or tripping at school/in public and stuff because it was still so exciting, but salvia just isnt enjoyable in any way.  It's not physically enjoyable even while on it, you get a horrible headache afterwards, and you just kinda disassociate but your body doesnt feel good or anything.  If anything it makes you feel super disconnected from the universe and everything unlike something like lsd or mushrooms where even if you're super fucked up you still feel a connection to things and your body feels amazing.  Salvia almost felt like i was out of body like in 3rd person almost.",
            "The point I was making since you insist on missing it, was that weed isn\u2019t a drug because the flower that grows is itself the \u201cdrug\u201d; marijuana isn\u2019t a flower you harvest and then take to the lab and mix with whatever else- the poppy flower that you sorta mentioned is also used as cooking oils salad dressing and even in margarine. Heroin HAS poppy in it, but you can\u2019t grab the poppy flower and inject yourself with it thinking it\u2019s heroin. Cocaine, is a drug made FROM coca leaves and although coca leaves themself have been said to give a \u201chigh\u201d, coca leaves themselves are not what cocaine is, crack is even further than cocaine with all the shit in it. A lot of prescription pain killers have opiates (derived from the poppy plant) but even pain killers themselves doesn\u2019t have poppy as it\u2019s only ingredient. So, you proved my point in that weed isn\u2019t a drug because you can literally pick it up, heat it up, and that\u2019s it because weed itself IS the \u201cdrug\u201d you\u2019re talking about but every drug considered a drug has multiple other ingredients that are required for the drug to exist."

Those two factors may be the reason for the observed negative health effects. For example, people of lower socioeconomic status may have less access to healthcare and therefore more undiagnosed illnesses, such as heart disease, which, in turn, may cause oversleeping.\u201d\n\n\u201cMultiple studies have found that people who sleep nine or more hours a night have significantly higher death rates than people sleeping seven to eight hours a night. No specific reason for this correlation has been determined. But researchers found that depression and low socioeconomic status are also associated with longer sleep.

We literally got lost in each other. Sweet, smart, gorgeous, quirky, had real hobbies/interests. \nBut we only met coincidentally a couple times and never managed to exchange numbers until the second to last time I saw her. \n\nFinally messaged her and we arranged a coffee date. \n\nShe stood me up and ghosted for a week. \nI didn't pester and I didn't leave a message like yours. \n\nShe then messaged me a really sweet apologetic message basically begging me to rearrange. She didn't message me or show up because of some emotional trouble. \n\nRearranged. Ghosted me again. \nI was actually heartbroken but I didn't pester her.\n\nI wont give specifics but it turns out she really was going through some serious mental health stuff. \nSometimes I still think about how things would have gone if she had met with me. I'd have done absolutely anything to support her. But it just didn't work out that way. \n\nI saw her a couple years later. She was out with another girl she introduced as her sister just sat out in a park. When we saw each other I thought she was going to cry. But I didn't hang around. Just said it was good to see she was OK. Trying not to let the words catch in my throat. \n\nMoral being... she was having a crisis. And if I'd been a jerk, who knows what would have happened!",
