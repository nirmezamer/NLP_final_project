            "If you drive long enough, you start to recognize these situations as high risk situations. You have to assume every car you\u2019re around is going to do something stupid. Assume the truck driver doesn\u2019t look over his shoulder and starts moving over. Would he see you if he\u2019s looking forward? Not in his blind spot, no. So you have three options. Accelerate to be in front of him. Coast down so you end up behind him in case he moves over. Or just be ready to hit the brakes if he moves over. After he moved into the first lane, you have to assume he won\u2019t stop. It\u2019s very basic defensive driving. I\u2019ve been driving 15,000 miles a year for about a decade now. Not one accident because at this point these situations are pretty much ingrained in me to stay away from. Part of it is just luck, but I\u2019ve avoided a lot of potential accidents, even if I was completely in the right.

If I'm to the right like you were in this scenario I'm letting off the gas to get this guy fully in front of me.

I'm not saying the merger's behavior is okay, it's just obscenely common and totally predictable - cruising into someone's blind spot when they have their blinker on coming out of a merge lane is asking to get sideswiped, you should not drive in people's blind spots if you can help it.

            "Why was the truck with the load still in the passing lane when being passed by vehicles on the right?  At some point you need to drop your ego, slow up, and move over.",
            "Truck driver towing shit in the left lane who intentionally wouldn\u2019t let somebody in front of him after they clearly showed intention.  Why do people have such fragile egos?  Now you got a fragile truck dummy, feel better than that guy you wouldn\u2019t let pass you?",
            "In many states if either party contributed to the accident, then they are liable for the accident.  The Mercedes driver looks to be the one who caused the accident, but it could be argued the truck driver sped up to prevent the merge and wasn't moving forward in the passing lane.  They both could be deemed at fault and liable for damages.  \n\nIMO both were being dicks and paid an unfortunate price.   Worse, they put others at danger too.",
            "Both of them are being idiots",
            "The truck driver at pretty much every moment of that video. He deliberately rammed the white car after it had already fully occupied the lane. His little landscaping business just came to an end.",
            "hard to judge speeds, but it looks to me like the white car was fully in the left lane, and maintaining a constant speed when the truck tried to accelerate around him. I'd argue the white car made a risky decision, but both legally and ethically the truck caused the accident.",
            "I blame the truck that shouldn't have been in the passing lane in the first place.",
            "Id put both at fault, as has been said by others. Truck with small peepee energy not letting the white car get in front but white car for being aggressive in trying to move over",
            "Obviously the white sedan, even though I personally would have let him through because it was absolutely obvious what would happen. They literally announced they'll do something stupid so let them be stupid in a way that doesn't involve a lot of stress.\n\nThey may get a new truck and trailer but it surely won't be worth the pain and paperwork.",
            "Nooooooo, where is the rest of the video? I wanted to see that truck crash & burn!",
            "The white sedan is at fault. The truck driver was a bigger idiot for playing FAFO while camping in the left lane with a trailer.",
            "Mercedes driver is at fault for initiating a turn lane when it\u2019s unsafe to do. \n\nYes the truck speed up to block but the law is clear you cannot initiate a turn while unless it\u2019s safe to do so and it was unsafe to do so. \n\n\nNow. Insurance companies would dictate liability. Without video Mercedes is 100% at fault. With video the insurance companies would off the Mercedes driver would argue 50% fault.",
            "By the damage alone and no witness, the truck woukd be ruled at fault since he hit the sedan in the back at highway speed.   \n\n Not sure what tge truck thinking he owned the highway, did not let the sedan switchlane and then failed to apply brake. Hitting other in the back would be ruled agaist his favour, and the camera video does not help the truck either.\n\nDickhead deserved the wreck himself made.",
            "It's hard to tell for sure based on the angle.  To me, it looked like there was enough room for the white car to merge in but not enough for them to safely do so.   However, the truck driver saw the car trying to change lanes and sped up to prevent them ultimately causing the accident.   \n\nSo \"technically\" I think the truck caused the accident.  But legally, they're probably both at fault.",
            "White car deliberately brake checks the truck as revenge for blocking it. The truck is an idiot, the white car is criminal. \n\nThe car should be 100% liable, but the truck fucked around and found out. Two idiots, one criminal.",
            "Tiny penis syndrome.",
            "Would be 50/50 for me. Mercedes does a reckless maneuver but the truck has no intention of stopping to avoid an accident, he takes the shoulder and ends up colliding.",
            "Stupid left lane camper.  They are always trucks hauling a trailer too.  If you drive a truck and are hauling something in a trailer and left lane camping you're a freaking moron.",
            "Both are idiots, not sure about fault. Truck was blocking that lane and needs to move over. White car was wrong to try and aggressively pass on the right and force it. Looked like the truck refused to let him though, so there was aggression on both sides.",
            "Just some context for this area...The exit sign they pass just before the accident is actually a left exit. Another mile or 2 after that this highway splits, left lane north, right 2 lanes east. \n\nSo in this area some slower traffic is using the left to exit not the right.",
            "Arrested for trash music",
            "They\u2019re both a pair of knobs. Truck hogging the passing lane, the white car trying to merge when it\u2019s not safe to do so, the truck refusing to make room - two dickheads acting like dickheads and working together to cause an accident.",
            "Probably a 70/30 fault on the Mercedese to truck. Truck was speeding up and not letting the Merc in (probably not wanting to be cut off) and did not do anything to evade the crash. \n\nMerc obviously threw himself into the lane with no regard for the other person just because he wanted to get somewhere a little faster.\n\nLegally, it is the Merc's responsability to merge safely and not knowingly take out other cars.",
            "White car forced its way across. Truck could\u2019ve done something to prevent a collision, but it wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve happened at all if the white car showed a bit of patience",

            "Did they start to accelerate? I can't tell if the truck speeds up or if the car slows down.",
            "Hard to tell, they may have still been accelerating, may have been pissed by the mercedes. If you look at the traffic in front of the truck, they get slower and then faster again. \n\nLegally speaking, if you change the lanes and cause an accident you're usually at fault, so the most the truck could get in my view is partial fault.",
            "because the white car made it slow down (you see it lose contact with the car in front and it) and was trying to recover speed",
            "the white sedan pulled alongside the car to his right."

The GC could be doing exactly what the shitty engineer put on the plans. Or the shitty GC could be cutting corners on safety despite the plans calling for more robust safety measures to be used.\n\nThe exit only thing had me confused until I realized you might might be talking about the EXIT OPEN sign that usually comes after the arrow board that is swapped for EXIT CLOSED if the exit is temporarily closed.  I agree\u2026that is yet another sign that is missing from this traffic control scheme. And yeah\u2026the cone taper is way too short for a full lane closure\u2026these are just more logs to put on the fire.

They will have the official copy of the approved plans, and they will usually send an inspector out to document and determine out how to make the work zone safe for everyone\u2026which I assume is everyone\u2019s goal here.
