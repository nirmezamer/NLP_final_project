        "content": "Hey folks. Mort here with what is going to be the nerdiest game design post you\u2019ll see in a while, but I wanted to share it with you. Generally in all aspects of life, even if you\u2019re confident in something, it\u2019s helpful to double check your biases and make sure you\u2019re actually correct or not. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen posts where a player rolls down 50 gold and doesn\u2019t see the uncontested unit they\u2019re looking for, heck you may have even been on that end yourself (sorry, but wait for the punchline). Sometimes, this experience can be so stark that you\u2019re concerned with the reliability of the system. Could this be bugged? I can\u2019t really be that unlucky\u2014is something wrong with the game? Now, my initial reaction is that this is a common thing called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d where a recent experience is being weighted more heavily. This, in conjunction with negativity bias, where negative experiences are seen to have a higher impact, become the fuel for many \u201cMortdogged\u201d experiences. But even with knowledge of these biases, is everything fine? I mean, TFT has had its share of bugs, so let\u2019s take a deep dive in the design space to make sure everything works as it should.\n\nFor this experiment, I focused on 4 costs. We pulled out 6 copies of nine of the Four Costs (these are our contested units), and left the other three Four costs as our uncontested units, with all 10 copies in the pool. At this point, this means there are 4 copies of the contested units (36 contested units total) and 10 copies of our three uncontested units (30 uncontested units total). If we do a large extensive roll down, we should see uncontested champions (30/66) 45% of the time approximately.\n\nWe ran this experiment for the first time, with Ornn, Ashe, and Kaisa as the three uncontested units (lol, Ornn is uncontested, right?), and here are the results.\n\n* Ornn: 136\n* Ashe: 168\n* Kaisa: 120\n* Lillia: 58\n* Morgana: 52\n* Kayn: 58\n* Lee Sin: 61\n* Syndra: 38\n* Nautilus: 53\n* Galio: 61\n* Annie: 50\n* Sylas: 46\n\nThe total 4 costs seen was 901, and the uncontested ones made up 424. This is (424/901) 47% of the time, which is within expected variance for something of this sample size, and matches our expectations. Good news. But of course, one time isn\u2019t enough, so let\u2019s run the experiment two more times.\u00a0\n\n* Ornn: 154\n* Ashe: 141\n* Kaisa: 178\n* Lillia: 57\n* Morgana: 72\n* Kayn: 48\n* Lee Sin: 53\n* Syndra: 57\n* Nautilus: 52\n* Galio: 62\n* Annie: 52\n* Sylas: 41\n* Total: 473/967 = 48.9%\n\nAnd again\n\n* Ornn: 150\n* Ashe: 140\n* Kaisa: 152\n* Lillia: 63\n* Morgana: 58\n* Kayn: 55\n* Lee Sin: 48\n* Syndra: 54\n* Nautilus: 47\n* Galio: 60\n* Annie: 64\n* Sylas: 55\n* Total: 442/946= 46.7%\n\nSo yeah, generally we\u2019re seeing the results we\u2019d expect with a sample size this big. It\u2019s not EXACTLY 45%, but the law of large numbers shows that this is expected, and if we dramatically increased the sample size, we would likely converge to that expected 45%. From a purely mathematical standpoint, it seems like our shop is working as expected. Huzzah!\n\nSo all is good right, and there\u2019s nothing to be done\u2026right? Well\u2026no actually. Just because it is mathematically correct does NOT mean the design is perfect. If you\u2019ve ever watched my stream, I\u2019ve talked about how good design doesn\u2019t just let RNG take the wheel, and designs around the core player experience. In this case, the player is not rolling down 1000 times and letting the law of large numbers do its job\u2026instead, it\u2019s rolling down 60 gold and expected results that are intuitive, which is that uncontested units show up more.\n\nLet\u2019s repeat the experiment, but instead of 1000 rolls, let\u2019s only do 40 and see what happens. Same thing, with Ornn/Ashe/Kaisa as our uncontested units, and see what happens.\n\n* Ornn: 8\n* Ashe: 6\n* Kaisa: 1\n* Lillia: 6\n* Morgana: 0\n* Kayn: 1\n* Lee Sin: 6\n* Syndra: 2\n* Nautilus: 4\n* Galio: 4\n* Annie: 0\n* Sylas: 2\n* Total: 15/40 = 37.5%\n\nBecause the sample size is so low, the variance expands pretty dramatically. Much like if you flip a coin 10 times and hit heads 7 times, 70% is way higher than 50%, but the reality is when the sample size is lower, the variance is higher. Again, this all lines up from a mathematical sense\u2026but from a game design standpoint it\u2019s pretty rough. Kai\u2019Sa is uncontested here and is seen one time, while Lee Sin has 6 copies out of the pool, and is seen 6 times! These are the experiences people have that feel off, and make them not trust the game.\n\nNintendo games do a lot of fudging behind the scenes I\u2019ve talked about before, to try to make expected outcomes more likely to happen. Famously one of the most basic versions of this is in Fire Emblem, where they double roll odds, so if something says 75%, it\u2019s actually 87.5% so it FEELS more like 75% to people (A 95% chance in Fire Emblem is much closer to 99%!) Based on this, I think there are improvements we can and should make here, so the game behaves closer to what you would EXPECT it to, even if it is within acceptable outcomes.\n\nPersonally, this was awesome for me to confirm and was a good use of time yesterday. I like constantly challenging our game design to see if we can do better, and I think this confirms we can. It won\u2019t be easy, it won\u2019t be overnight, and it may not even be soon\u2026but I think it is worth exploring, and I think we\u2019ll start doing that as soon as possible.\u00a0\n\nThanks for reading all. Hope your roll downs are within expected variance, and take it easy :)\n\n",

Maybe high costs could be less reliable, but lower cost units more so - therefore reducing some of the RNG downsides when finishing off your comp if you decide to play around high rolling a 4 or 5 cost?",

If I see in the tooltip there's actually 1 ashe because 5 of them are randomly sitting in someone's shop, I might wait for 4-3 and the shops to recycle.",

It feels like the game is cheating even if it is in the player's favor, and I've always hated when games like Fire Emblem do this.",

            "Ask a human to write an entire page of random coin flips, and ask a computer to do it. It would be insanely easy for you to be able to tell which is which, because the computer generated list will sometimes contain very long streaks. Humans would never feel comfortable putting H 8 times in a row, but every 8 character string has a 1/256 chance of appearing as one. In a page with 500+ letters it's actually more likely to appear than not.\n\nThe counterpart to the law of large numbers is, well, Murphy's Law. Even something very unlikely will inevitably happen if you repeat an experiment enough times. \n\nI remember a long time ago, Riot Xypherous was working on how critical strikes functioned in Summoner's Rift. This was when a standard crit was 200% damage and people would put in 1% crit runes into their rune pages. A well timed crit could change an early game lane trade into an unexpected kill and snowball from there. It was especially noticeable when, every so often, someone could randomly get multiple crits within a few attacks. Meanwhile, you could invest in early crit (25%) and not crit at all in an 8-attack trade.\n\nSo I think Xypherous made crit chance lie to you, sort of. Each time your attack does not crit, you gain a hidden bonus on your next attacks. When you did crit, it would get reset to something *lower* than your listed crit chance (like half, I would guess). It was mathematically set up that in the very long run your total DPS was unaffected, but the crits would feel more evenly distributed. As far as I know, it still works like this, or if it was changed it was by a rioter less communicative than Xypherous.\n\nYou don't need me to tell you this, but it's definitely okay to lie, as long as people don't know *and* as long as the \"true\" mechanic allows for people's assumptive play to still be viable/optimal. Like would people play any differently if uncontested units were forced to appear more consistently even at small samples? Would anyone ever even notice?",

I know that it is statistical variance, but it still feels horrible to experience as you can feel you got basically \"cheated\" out of any good decision or play you might have done earlier.\n\nAs some people have suggested, I think some sort of \"random playlist\" mechanic could be nice for the game, as true random is usually not very enjoyable. Balancing the odds of the next rolls based on previous rolls would make sense in that case. Maybe you could even have a \"pity\" system where if you haven't rolled one unit at all, it is guaranteed to show up after a certain number of rolls ?\n\nThanks again for checking in with the community, we appreciate it a lot :D",
            "Thank you!",

            "I think it's really good you are putting some thoughts into this.\n\nOf course, TFT is about RNG and that's what keeps it interesting. I just had to think about a [post](https://web.archive.org/web/20200314084825/https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/0RYiPNBI-quick-gameplay-thoughts-december-13) by Meddler on the boards a long time ago, where he talked about input randomness vs. output randomness, and how especially the latter *can* be frustrating. I feel like the shop in TFT can be seen as both simultaneously.\n\nEspecially in the early stages, it's mostly input randomness. You can choose to buy or not to buy the champs you're being offered and you will probably try to build a team around what the shop is offering you.\n\nBut once you start actively *rolling* for specific champs, it basically turns into output randomness. You invest x amount of gold, and either you get the desired champion(s), or you don't. In the later stages of the game, you usually can't really react to what the shop gives you anymore, instead, you rely on the shop giving you what you need.\n\nI would say having good eco and therefore having enough gold to actually roll a lot is one aspect of skill in TFT, so it does feel incredibly frustrating when you do manage to accumulate a lot of Gold and XP and then you get absolutely nothing for playing well because variance wasn't on your side, and someone with less gold (and maybe worse eco management) is just hitting and wins against you.\n\nOf course just having enough eco shouldn't mean you don't need to care about chances anymore and the game gives you everything you want. But I do think there could be improvements to ensure that after playing well for most of the game, you don't suddenly lose everything you built towards just because of bad luck.",
            "Mort you are awesome, I love that we have you as lead dev of the game we love. I recently had one of those Riot Surveys about TFT and not once did I downvote anything dev or balance related because I know you guys care. Mistakes can happen and you do this all with one hand tied behind your back due to patch cycles and PlayStore timings. My only grievance is with the absurd cosmetic prices and gacha rolls which I expect you have less say in. Keep up the fantastic work. I will however keep using 'Mortdogged' because it's too funny to act like you're some diety that influences and checks every single roll that's made",
            "One of the things your missing here is that the variance can also go the other way.  Having a system that lets you sometimes get that 2\\* 4 cost online early feels more fun than having an even system that's predictable.  Great post like love the amount of research you've done!",
            "> It won't be easy, it won't be overnight, and it may not even be soon...\n\nWill you let us know when something is implemented? \n\nAnd if yes, will you share details of the mechanic or not?\n\nThanks for being open to investigate and discuss it!",
            "Hey Mort, I think it's awesome that you're sincerely responding to the community concerns here. I don't have any opinion on whether there's a lingering bug here, but I think it's important to point out that the analysis you've done isn't sufficient evidence to eliminate the possibility.\n\nEven when the overall distribution of outcomes is correct (in this case, how many times each champion shows up in the shop), the system as a whole can be functioning incorrectly in a way to make tail events like not getting any copies of a particular champion significantly more likely than would be expected. This is because there's still possibilities of correlations between rolls, and there are many possible styles of correlations that leave the overall distribution untouched.\n\nI want to post two stories about imperfect RNG that I was directly involved with where this was the case.\n\nThe first is related to Pokemon speedruns circa 2013. The Pokemon Yellow speedrun involved catching a Level 6 Male Nidoran (a 5% chance) just before Viridian Forest to use as the main fighter throughout the run. The runner Gunnermaniac was saying \"When you get a level 6 Female Nidoran, if you get a 3 step encounter it's ALWAYS a level 6 Male Nidoran.\" (The game prevents encounters before taking 3 steps so this is the earliest possible second encounter). I initially dismissed this as confirmation bias, as many people in these threads are doing now.\n\nThe RNG used in the gen 1 Pokemon games doesn't resemble the types of RNG that would be used in games today, but even so the individual RNG values were sufficiently unpredictable that it made sense to treat them as random. But it turned out that the RNG value used to determine whether an encounter happens was correlated with the RNG value used to pick which encounter it was in such a way that only changed slowly over time. The overall encounter rates would always average out, but the distributions for encounters at particular times does not resemble the overall encounter rate at all. Very frequently there are only a few possible encounters after accounting for the timing.\n\nWe took advantage of this in what would be known as \"DSum Manipulation\": http://wiki.pokemonspeedruns.com/index.php?title=Pok%C3%A9mon_Red/Blue/Yellow_DSum_Manipulation (It would later be generally replaced by full RNG manipulation that involves rebooting the console and performing the exact same sequence of buffered inputs to get the same result).\n\nThe second story is about Slay the Spire. There's a relic in the game called Snecko Eye which replaces the energy cost of each card with a random value from 0 to 3. Ever since the game was released, people would post about how they hate Snecko Eye because it seems to screw them over by giving them all high cost cards. Eventually a player decided to record all their energy costs over the course of a run and made this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/7yph7x/snecko_eye_stats/\n\nIf you read through the comments there, you can see a lot of the same patterns that we see on this issue. [People saying the poster is unlucky](https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/7yph7x/snecko_eye_stats/duiaqy5/), [people checking large sample size aggregate statistics and saying it looks fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/7yph7x/snecko_eye_stats/duigd37/), [the dev posting a snippet of code that seems to imply there is no issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/7yph7x/snecko_eye_stats/duihnmc/). But at the same time there were people pointing toward the real problem: [sequences of numbers were repeating more often than expected](https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/7yph7x/snecko_eye_stats/duj3d60/).\n\nI was motivated to dig deeper and [posted a followup thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/7yxcpa/snecko_eye_costs_are_kind_of_predictable/). Even though the RNG itself was OK, the way the devs seeded it for each fight meant that consecutive fights would get nearly identical sequences of random rolls. That meant that if you look at it over a whole run, the chance that you get an unreasonable number of 3 cost cards is significantly higher than it would be had each roll been independent.\n\nMy takeaways from these experiences is to be a lot more skeptical about even the simplest looking implementations of randomness. It's much easier than people expect to accidentally create correlations between random values, and these correlations can meaningfully change the tail probabilities. There are more comprehensive statistical tests like [TestU01](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TestU01) that will probably catch a lot, although I haven't tried using it personally. So I don't like dismissing the people who still believe there's a bug as conspiracy theorists. The nature of randomness makes it difficult to prove that there's a bug and it's easy to dismiss people's intuition as confirmation bias even when there really is a bug.",
            "why don\u2019t you place the number of remaining champ in the pool ? How can we trust that you fix the bug effectively when you failed us at the most fundamental thing in game ?",
            "Thanks for looking into this, but I'm still pained by spending 100+ gold and unable to 3 star a basic unit. That shouldn't happen no matter the luck. It feels, and while you said feeling is different, it feels like it's so hard to get 3 stars this set, and ruins my experience, as my fun is had by having one big gold carry.",
            "Does the percentage change at all depending on how many 1 costs or 2 costs are out of the pool? Say there's a lot of 3 costs out of the pool, will it affect the 4 costs being pulled at all since there are now less 3 costs in the pool? I don't know if I'm getting my question out right.",
            "Was there ever a mechanic in place, where if you got a champion in your shop, but did not buy them, they would be locked from your shop for a set number of turns?\n\nI feel like that would change these stats quite a bit, but it would also make \"fail rolling\" (accidentally skipping your champ) even worse.\n\nAnother idea would be, that if you do not buy a champ for 5+ rolling rounds, the odds of seeing champs you have not seen in these five rolls increases slightly.",
            "Great post, really good info. \n\nThe thing I always remind myself is the story of the statistics professor who asked students to write 100 heads and tails or to flip a coin and copy it down. He could tell 100% who had made it up and who had flipped it. \n\nThe fake ones would alternate heads and tails back and forth. \n\nThe real ones would have heads ten in a row and then ten tails in a row. \n\nAnyone who has played poker can tell you how this works! 99% chance to hit is a 1% chance to miss. \n\nThat said - is all of the RNG actually random? Because I swear I never see anyone play kogmaw reroll but when I try it cause I hit 2 star kog, I notice someone else also hit it. \n\nDoes the game make some traits more available than others or is it just confirmation bias?",

I'm sure both biases are present.",
            "Isn't the magic of TFT that when it is at it's best and the player knows what they are doing it is a game of adaptation to your circumstances? \n\nYeah it sucks not to hit that uncontested Kaisa you might have hoped for but regardless of what items you have slammed I think that roll down should have provided you with enough 4 costs you should be able to build something out of.\n\nTo me at least the game feels best when I do a good job of reacting to what RNGesus has dumped in my lap. That is when I feel like whatever knowledge/skill I have impacted the game. Sure I won't get a first every game but I should be doing well enough to climb.\n\nWhen you start massaging the results that feels like we are just moving further towards forcing stuff because we know it will work out in the end.\n\nIf there were to be tweaks made I think it would be better to look into ways to encourage the flex play.\n\nAs GV8/Goose said \"You always highroll, you just don't always notice what the game gave you\".",

            "Wowowowowowow who do I blame now tho?",
            "This is a really interesting post. \n\nIn reality the changing pool size in TFT makes it incredibly difficult to determine whether a player not hitting an uncontested unit is due to variance or if its the expected outcome.  Being uncontested doesn't necessarily mean that you're likely to hit a unit. \n\nOne example I could think of when this could be the case is if you are the first or the only player to be rolling for a specific tier of champions. Another example could be when most players are dead, and most copies of units have returned back into the pool. These are factors that players may not consider when deciding to roll down.\n\nIf you repeated this experiment where you are searching for the same three 4 cost champions (Ornn, Ashe, Kai'sa), but all champions remain in the pool, on average 25% of 4 cost champions that appears in your shop will be one of the three champions you are looking for. That's almost twice as unlikely compared to an average of 45% in Mortdog's example despite the units being uncontested in both situations.\n\nTo put this into perspective, if you rolled down and saw 40 4 cost champions in your shop, you would on average have 10/40 of the champions to be either Ornn/Ashe/Kai'sa if all units remained in the shop. In Mortdog's example where other units are contested, you would expect 18/40 champions to be what you are looking for.\n\nAnd the thing is that these are static examples, so who knows what the actual odds of you hitting a unit are when multiple people are rolling down at the same time. Statistics can be super unintuitive to understand but overall I think TFT is doing a great job so far with variance all things considered.",
            "Great post, thanks for the transparency Mort! Your point about Nintendo games fudging percentages behind the scenes makes me wonder if Pok\u00e9mon does the same with its RNG, especially with regards to move accuracy and secondary effects.

It would make it harder to 3 star things in general, and dramatically increase the value of champion duplicators to get the final copy of a unit.",

You scout and see ZERO ashe\u2019s out of the pool and have 70 gold to roll with. You roll and hit none???? But in reality other players may have rolled or been rolling, if 4/7 players have an unpurchased Ashe in shop your odds are lower without you actually being aware of this in any way. So rolling becomes more of a gamble the lower the pool size which is much more apparent in a 4 cost meta as opposed to 3-1 cost meta. Much like you can dent a 3 star 5 cost by just locking shop with one copy of the unit as the enemy sells their entire board rolling down thinking they are all in the pool. I don\u2019t think a solution exists for this aside the fact of rolling down when others are to ensure the most reliable odds since people will be more likely to \u201cwait\u201d to roll again with desired units in shop meaning they are less likely to be sitting on your unpurchased desired unit. \n\nP.S.

I'm wondering if these experiments were done with one player rolling down or all 8 (as is typical of 4-1, 4-2) I always feel like I'm missing uncontested units because they show up in someone else's shop right before I roll. I've had many duelist games where I pass up like 6 Annie's in the roll down and see like 1 lee. I just assume some one who's looking for Annie is also missing. I'm not sure how much this stirring the pot effects everything or if it all evens out due to random variables summing together to guassians blah blah blah.\n\nI also have been going back and forth between buying other 4 costs to pull them out of my shops. but this also increases odds of my units showing up in other players shops too. I haven't payed enough attention to know what works better.\n\nBasically it sounds like a giant math problem that can't really be solved analytically. I really enjoy hearing about these experiments though. I've read somewhere that crits in league are handled via markov chain to make 30% crit chance more reliably ensure ~1 of every 3 attacks crit. I'm not sure what more sophisticated models could be/are employed in tft and I get the feeling you don't want to give away the keys to that car but regardless these insights are really fun to hear about.",

Like, am I more likely get offered a Hedge Fund, Dryad Emblem, or Fortune Emblem Augment if I'm running Dryad/Bruiser/Kobuko?\n\nOn that note, if you ever do read these comments, I'm curious what the reception is to the hero augments this set. Because personally *(if you didn't see my recent post about them* [*<here>*](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamfightTactics/comments/1cy8d3n/future_idea_for_hero_augments_when_selected_that/)*)* I absolutely love them, and have loved them since their inception. Specifically, I have always loved Hero Augments for lower-cost units, because there is a satisfying fantasy with turning these low cost, often expendable units into serious power houses as the game goes on.\n\nTo that note about my previous comment, I am curious if there could ever be an implementation of Augment-bias based off user playstyle? As in, If I *am* presented with a hero augment, I am *extremely* likely to pick it, but the issue for me personally is that I hardly ever get offered them. I've easily played over 500 games this set so far, and I've seen Shen's augment 4 times, Garen's 6 times, Kobuko & Yorick's 3 times, and Neeko's only twice. Which is disappointing to say the least! Because when I do get them, but it's just \"*one of those games*\", it sucks to know that it could be literal days or weeks until I get the offer again.\n\nAny chance we'd be able to see carry augments for *all* 1 cost (and maybe even 2 cost) units in future sets as a staple? But have their appearance rate depend on the user playstyle, so people that avoid them like the plague are given the absolute lowest possibility of ever seeing them? I ask this because any time I try turning a 1 cost unit into a proper carry, they typically lose the sauce between wolves and chicken rounds, and it's a bit sad. I also think it makes for a really fun opportunity to, like Nasus' Stacks on stacks, or Galio's Justice Punch from set 8, turn traditionally tank/front line units into hypercarries.\n\nSorry for the long post- I know you're busy! Thanks for this write up. Hoping for more low-cost hero augments next set! They really are what keeps me playing more often! Not a coincidence that for Set 9 and 10 I took a backseat since that had little to no hero augments at all!",

If, after 15 rolls, you still don't see a Kaisa, the odds may start to gradually shift such that you are more likely to see one. Maybe the 16th roll has her at 12% instead.

But the actual string of numbers isn't random, its predetermined and can be used again(this is why in speedrunning you can determine which seed you have and there for know what will \"randomly\" happen) And is often used in computers as its usually good enough.\n\nBut to actually get a random number the computers needs to look at something that is random, as the computer itself can not be random.

            "I would take 100 crystals instead of random useless legend which iam never gonna use. At least crystals will be used for chibi legend",
            "bro its so insane, i was thinking about buying the pass for the pulls, but first i did the free pulls from the event, 90% of it was just 100 realm crystals, so i decided not to xd",
            "Idk man I just got that lit beach arena for 2500 crystals. I'm pretty pleased.",
            "yeah... I spent too much but atleast I was guarenteed the chibi in around 10ish rolls since I had everything else and now all I'm getting is the crummy crystals that are effectively useless to me",
            "It\u2019s always so interesting to me to see whales complain about massively overpriced content, as if the reason companies don\u2019t do this is BECAUSE of whales being willing to spend large amounts of money chasing that gamba high\n\nBut anyway yeah treasure realms and TFT monetization bad",
            "... I'm a TFT whale and I didn't even realize the new system even gave out tacticians anymore, thought it was just a crystal dispenser. And I've already put in a couple hundred to get the poro fluft. Wack. Is that what determines the variance in crystals?\n\nThe reason I've put so much in is from rolling for specific things. In beta, I ended up with all the little legends just trying to get the sugarcone furyhorn at 3*, and same thing for pretty much one in every set since until the pink shards. I'm not a fan of chibis, but keep falling in love with these random legendaries and specific boards. I much prefer being able to buy certain ones from the shop. If I can ever get the Chinese new year board with the poro audience, my whaling can finally stop.",
            "you can gamble. get new thing if not get the new thing to buy it for free... it's win win for you plus you get mythic points to save for new skins",
            "Is it the second time I see this same post?",
            "I enjoy having more agency in the process of choosing rewards. \n\nPersonally I really disliked having only 2 or 3 mythic treasure realm options available at once for long periods of time.\n\nIn regards to wether people get more bang for buck, i got fluft of poros without spending any extra money because of the pengu pass tokens.  And now have 8 mythic tokens again after spending only like $30 nzd and the free tokens. This seems way better than before, but now that I have very limited tokens without buying them (only battle pass left but still deciding whether to buy) the remaining 2 medalions would cost me like $90ish dollars if I only got garenteed medallions. This still seems quite expensive, but more on par with league hextech crafting gems before they made it a dust.\n\nBut also I may have gotten very lucky since i pulled the x4 medallions reward 2 times. And dont know if this is likely since I havent looked at the rewards table yet.",
            "SB Ahri was my last hurrah, this system is bogus.",
            "How about we don\u2019t complain about a cosmetics in a game that is 100% free?",
            "Yeah it's like people would rather spend ***two hundred quid*** gambling than be patient with that they want to actually get. Jesus Christ what am i reading.",
            "why getting all of them if 90% are bad",
            "i mean he still can gamble...",
            "How do you buy the thing you want without spending 200 with the new system",
            "Wait for it to rotate back in? I have like 1900 green things from the pass or whatever. There nothing i require since i have Darkstar Whisker, Malphite Chibi, and a squink of some kind. Eventually I'll have X00 for whatever bullshit tactician i like in the rotating shop and I'll pick it up. Or have x000 for whatever fancy board i like. I use Grotto of Secret Spa anyway, the dragon statue rules. \n\nLike for real, does Child Neglect Bruce Lee Sin or Condescending Morgana or Actually Pretty Cool But Not Necessary Star Guardian Classroom Board require you to spend 200 quid a month?? I understand FOMO, I play Magic the Gathering, but it's a self control thing. Thank god the gambling is less appealing."
