We typically reply with something that he refuses to eat because he\u2019s a very picky eater. \n2. Then he says \u201cI\u2019m hungry now\u201d (it may be an hour before dinner so I don\u2019t want to offer something that will fill him up). I reply with an offer of an apple or some other fruit. He says they\u2019re yucky. \n3. I remind him that we set the menu but he can choose what to eat. He sulks on the couch. \n\nThis is typically combined with a dialogue where he\u2019s bored and any activity suggestion I offer is rejected. \n\nWhat can I do to break this cycle of the \u201cno\u2019s\u201d? I feel like I\u2019m talking to a wall and my son stubbornly shows zero interest in working together.",
            "I have a family member whose 11yo kid hits him. He's been doing it since toddlerhood. The dad won't say no or discipline him. He just holds his hands out to ward off attacks. The punches are hard, like he's trying to hurt his dad, but the dad acts like he thinks the kid is playing. \n\nThis is a big kid. In a couple of years, he will start sprouting, and looking at his size right now, I would not be surprised if he ends up bigger and stronger than Dad. This is a disaster in the making. No one will talk to the dad as he's very sensitive about parenting, but there will be elder abuse coming in a few years (dad is an older parent). I am not close at all to this family member; we actually clash. So, do we just watch this all play out?"

A reason why it couldn't have waited until the baby was awake, and you could take them with you? Why you couldn't wait for your partner to be home, so they could stay with the baby?\n\nLike... yeah, okay, I'll be honest, the odds of something happening are slim. The chances of you getting into a car accident (or getting hit by a car), or someone breaking in while you're gone are unlikely. But for something that's not needed, that's not necessary, that can easily wait a few hours.... why would you run that risk? Especially given that newborns are *notorious* for waking up often, not sleeping soundly, etc. Like... even if you were only gone for fifteen minutes, imagine your baby waking up five minutes after you leave, and crying for ten minutes until you get back.\n\nAnd then ask yourself if the few hours -at most -to wait was worth it.",

Is the milk that important? \n\nAlso, it\u2019s illegal and considered neglect. CPS standard of care is pretty low- it\u2019s the basic lowest level of keeping a baby/child alive.

I had to grab keys to her unit and Fire Dept went in and got baby - and guess who they were required to call? She was gone 10-15mins when this happened. Her unit wasn\u2019t at risk, but you never know how fast something can spread. And it\u2019s just not legal to leave them home alone.",

But reality - people who live in the country leave their babies sleeping in the house while they walk out to feed the goats or clean a horse stall or move the irrigation system\u2026 as far and as much time as a trip to the corner store. I think it seems different because it is on the same property. But something *could* happen to parent or baby. \n\nSomething *could* happen to parent or baby inside a house as well. A baby could choke in its room while you are taking a poop or a shower or just watching a show downstairs.",

But I will either wake baby up, or just not show up for pick up and make him walk (about 7 minutes walk) home. I\u2019d never leave the baby alone even for the 4 minutes it\u2019d take to the bus stop and back. Not going to happen.",

Yet people are SCREAMING at you that it's neglect, yet it's ok to take a baby monitor to your yard and outside. You're literally going like, 2 doors down from your own front door. While I agree it's never okay to leave a baby alone, I'm also confused about why sitting outside for 30+ minutes while the baby is napping is ok, as long as you're still in the yard... But taking a literal 3 minute walk (1 minute to walk there, 1 minute to grab the milk and pay, 1 minute to walk back) is suddenly so absolutely life threatening for the baby because the house just decided in that 3 minutes it wanted to spontaneously combust.",

I would say the reason also has a lot to do with with appropriateness.",

None of his friends discuss this kind of thing, he doesn\u2019t read parenting books or articles. \n\nIt has made me feel slightly crazy over the years to argue for car seats and bike helmets and not letting the toddlers play on the roof. So when the kids were little, he deferred almost 100% to my sense of safety. And now that they are older, I\u2019m letting him do more safe-risky things with them on the condition that we must give a basic understanding of how to assess the risk and how to recover. I do see that it\u2019s good for them NOW. Not back then \u2014 when it could\u2019ve given them a false sense of safety in a dangerous situation.",

That's just how I think about it for me. :)",

I got distracted by some cars starting a race. Slipped in a puddle. Fell flat on my face, and my knee bent entirely the wrong way. I army crawled back to my apartment and went to the hospital and I was in a cast and then a walking boot for months, but I had nightmares for years of my daughter being alone and that happening. Absolutely not, no way in hell. Never ever okay.",

            "I've read a lot of the comments and i agree that there is no valid reason to leave a baby at any amount of time unsupervised. It is not only because what if something happens to you and the baby is left alone. There is also what we call sudden infant death syndrome or SIDS. A baby less than one year old especially less than a month old could suddenly stop breathing for no apparent cause. It happens to perfectly healthy neonates. It could happen anytime. Even when the parents are only in the next room. That is why it is never advisable to leave a newborn out of your sight even for a few minutes. You always check breathing, color and temperature. Even if the baby is asleep. \n\nI think the question you should ask yourself is if you can live for a few hours without milk. If you can't, can you risk living forever without your baby? Which is your priority. It's not an argument of what might happen or how unlikely it could happen. It's if you can live with the consequences if it does.",

Wait till they wake up, give them a bottle or boob, then take them along. Until they're 4 months old or whenever it is that they start having fairly set daytime and nighttime patterns, just take them wherever you go, whenever it is. \n\nI took amazing midnight walks with my infant and had great late dinners at restaurants with the baby in a foldable bassinet right at the table. Amazing. Now he's almost 3 years old and I have to be home by 5:45 or the whole evening routine is shot \ud83d\ude2b But at 3 weeks? Just take them to the corner store at 2am if you want. They give no f's.",

He began to choke on his vomit and had no motor control to turn his head. I was laying on my bed trying to decide what needed to be done first while he was sleeping then It sounded like a small gurgle and I shot up and looked. Sure enough, he was squirming blueish and trying to fight for air. I turned him over and he was fine after a few scary breaths, but I think of that a lot. What if I went pee. What if I got a cup of coffee. Two or three minutes is all it takes. No baby should be left unattended that cannot even control their head or movement. None. Not in a car. Not in a bassinet, not in a car seat or even the floor. Not alone.",

I\u2019d never leave my baby unattended while walking away from the property.\n\nStory time.\n\nWay before I ever got pregnant in our first apartment, one day my husband and our three roommates were hanging out. I was about 21 at the time. I left the room to go pee and suddenly saw my bedroom across the hall was filled with smoke. My dog was on the other side of the room terrified, I had to hold my breath and dive through to drag him out (so much smoke that it didn\u2019t matter how tightly I closed my eyes or held my breath, I still ended up with smoke inhalation.)\n\nWe ran downstairs, woke up our other roommates, my husband called the fire department.\n\nTurns out the dumb fucks next door working on the attached apartment were doing some electrical work (unlicensed) and caused an electrical fire. Instead of, idk, putting it out or knocking on our door, *they sealed the dry wall thinking it would smother the flames and left it.*\n\nLuckily the majority of the damage was next door. The fire fighters and police really laid into the contractors, called their foreman and the landlord. They were all pissed and they got a fine.\n\nWe were all okay. My BIL roommate grabbed the cat and we ran out.\n\nOne second, we were all having a good time. The next our apartment was filled with smoke that you couldn\u2019t even see through. Lots of stairs. Electrical fires are no joke and where this was 100% the fault of under the table unlicensed contractors electrical fires can happen anywhere at anytime. You never know who had their hands on your electrical before you bought your house, and even if you do, appliances become faulty, floods happen, etc etc.\n\nThis is the reason why neither my husband nor I will NEVER leave LO unattended. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s just around the corner. I don\u2019t care. Shit happens fast. It took 0 time for our apartment to be filled. Scary stuff.",

A gust of wind blew the front door shut and LOCKED it, and we had no key. I went into complete panic mode, running around to neighbours to try and get a ladder and climb in over the back wall. Meanwhile my mum climbed up on a big wheelie bin and jumped the wall at the back. It's a 2 metre drop onto concrete so it's a miracle she didn't break a hip or something. The baby was fine, everyone was fine, but since then I've been so paranoid about it! Spare key hidden in the garden, never go out without a key in my pocket, etc etc. (It's so weird it happened in the first place, as I never lock the door when we go out.

Lol. \n\n(Ps the baby's safety probably matters too. <I'm being silly, of course the baby safety matters> But even though a collision and injury are statistically more likely to happen in a car, multiple adults will intervene on the child's behalf in those situations. Allowing the babies to survive, compared to a less statistical accident occurring when leaving the baby home alone. No adults would be able to intervene. )",

Consider driving during times they need to sleep so that they need to readjust less.  If this isn\u2019t an option, the. Consider getting some things for them to play with while you sleep so that they burn energy that way and then sleep in the car.\n\nLastly, if it\u2019s bed time but they have too much energy to fall asleep just compromise and do things to burn their energy.\n\nGood luck!!",
            "This is a tried and true rite of passage for vacationing with kids. I'm really sorry it is happening to you. I have little advice, but the one piece of advice I've got is don't fight with your husband. Pull him aside, have a good vent about the fact that this is some bullshit, and make it you two against the tyranny of these unreasonable children. You'll feel better if you're both in the same boat against unreasonable circumstances instead of against each other. It'll feel better than being pissy to one another.",
            "The beach you are going to must be amazing if you are driving that far to get to it!!! Good luck with the rest of the trip- you\u2019ll have to stop at some scoped out locations (playgrounds, zoos etc. to get them tired out!)",

            "Next time try to drive the whole distance. Having crap sleep when you only have 4 more hours to go isn\u2019t worth it. If you need to stop on the way, tire them out with the hotel pool. They have to get their energy out. My kids always slept badly the first night of a vacation but it improved after a day or two. Traveling with kids isn\u2019t pretty but the important part is arriving to the destination. It may not be pretty getting there but you just need to arrive. The beach will be nice. Enjoy!",

            "When we had small children, we would often drive through the night.  One parent would drive while the other slept. The kids got a pretty good nights sleep. When we arrived, we were still tired, but at least the kids weren\u2019t sleep deprived.",

            "I'm really sorry this happened to you. My daughter learned to climb out of her pack n play at 22mo in a hotel room, so we brought her into bed with us, and she did the same thing as yours! I was her jungle gym until about 4am. Oh yeah, this was the night before my grandmother's funeral. It was awful.  \nI went out the next day and bought her a KidCo PeaPod tent. It's collapsible, so it travels really easily, and we zip her into it.  \nHoping you can salvage the beginning of your vacation and make the rest of it as lovely as possible. Hang in there!!",
            "There are various strategies. We have nobody to watch our kids while adults do solo vacation. So it\u2019s all 5 of us together. Some parents leave at 8pm and drive through the night. That worked well one time for us. We also did two hotel rooms one night as one kid was being good but the other one wouldn\u2019t sleep. So I toughed it out with the difficult kid. So my wife and other kid could sleep. Next time we are driving 14 hours all in same day. You lose a lot of time/energy unpacking for hotel. Flying is another option for folks. Also choose a closer vacation spot is another.",
            "Went on vacation to the Lake of the Ozarks last week. Long drive, 12.5 hours minimum. We took our 2 and 4 year olds. Same deal, great sleepers, super sweet and well behaved kids. \n\nFirst leg down, we got a hotel outside of St. Louis. No problems on the drive, but the hotel wasn\u2019t great. Just kinda dirty and not well kept. \n\nAs I\u2019m bringing stuff in from the truck, the 2 year old throws up on the floor in the hotel room. Linoleum floors, thankfully, though the smell didn\u2019t fully come out. \n\nOvernight the 2 year old slept with mom, that largely went okay other than some giggling early on. (We have never allowed the children to sleep in our bed, outside of sickness or early morning rising)\n\nThe 4 year old slept with me, and she damn-near does cartwheels in her sleep. I got kicked in the balls, head butted in the nose (bloodied), and she kept trying to climb up on my pillow. \n\nBad night sleep, but whatever. Eat the shitty hotel breakfast and hit the road!\n\nAs we near the house rental, the terrain gets very hilly. I mean, like, roller coaster hilly. Big windy up and down roads. Our kids didn\u2019t have motion sickness, until now. \n\nAfter they each threw up a couple of times, we found a pharmacy and got the kids some Dramamine. That helped a little at first, but both kids kept crying, and gagging, and dry-heaving. Just a rough time. Cleaned up on the road as best we could, but as we finally arrived to the house, we were absolutely DONE with that. \n\nVacation was nice, great family time. \n\nThe ride home, we give the kids the Dramamine before we hit the road. Our 2 year old made it just fine, but the 4 year old had a bad time. We decided to drive straight through on the ride home. The first third of the trip took forever. The remaining two thirds weren\u2019t bad, but the trip home took soooo long, lol. \n\nA 12.5 hour car ride took us over 16 hours. Left at 5am in the Ozarks to arrive home at 10:30pm. \n\n\nWe did it. We don\u2019t want to do it again anytime soon.",
            "My hubs and I took our 1 and 5 year old on a 14 hour car trip in March; every 3 hours (if they weren\u2019t asleep) we\u2019d stop, type in \u201cchildren\u2019s park near me\u201d into google and BAM! We visited some really awesome neighborhood parks along the way. I packed snackle boxes for them and pulled them out at the park. We picnicked and they just loved it! Our favorite was one in Brentwood, TN! Absolutely stunning and had NO MULCH so our little one could crawl. \nIf you ask our 5 year old about vacation, she doesn\u2019t mention the beach in Destin (which is where we went) but rather the cool parks and picnics along the way. We embraced that it was part of the vacation. The hotel we stopped at for the halfway point had a pool so we let them swim and play in the water. We just realized that traveling alone and wanting to get there when it was just us was feasible; now with two littles, we had to make it part of the vacation and it became a whole different mindset. Good luck!",

            "We visit my dad 1-2 times a year (Ohio to Florida, 13 hour drive minimum). We have done this since my oldest was one and my youngest was an infant. Now we have 3 kids- ages 5 years, 4 years, and 6 months. Despite what many of these comments say, you aren\u2019t crazy for making this drive. It is hard, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t vacation with kids. Our first trip was horrible, but the kids have gotten way better with practice (and so have we). We\u2019ve learned how to make the drive easier with breaks and way too many snacks. And we\u2019ve learned to exhaust the kids and have zero expectations for a typical bedtime. We\u2019ve already made the trip once since the baby was born and are planning another trip in about a month!",
            "Fighting and being upset about it is a choice. I don\u2019t understand why you have chosen to be pissy about it? You\u2019ve never got a bad nights sleep before? You\u2019re going to punish your husband for it now by starting fights for no reason? This all sounds like a personal problem. \n\nDon\u2019t ruin the vacation for everyone else just because you had a bad nights sleep.",

            "Thank you for the acknowledgment. \n\nYou are an absolute gem. \n\nAnd most importantly you are not alone in this. My oldest eis now 5 and I just experienced 2 vacations that gave me joy. \n\n1 where I decided to to throw everything overboard and just do absolutely nothing. They didn\u2019t have to do jack just be themselves. And well the other one I bribed them with Disney. \n\nSo try to stop a few times more often to do a walk. Or pick a flower. \n\nStay away from phones that show you picture perfect lies. And make sure you keep acknowledging you are tired. And feed your energy and find those markers. Yes your kids will scream but those in between moments when they are cute acknowledge those",
            "14 hour drive with a 2 & 4 year old??? Why didn\u2019t you fly?",
            "Oh yeah no under 10yrs old is just a trip, not a vacation.",
            "I wish you would have asked for advice before this happened because people definitely would have warned you that sleep might be elusive to the kids. They just sat in a car all day and then were put in new, fun environment, and you guys expected them to sleep. Some kids do that but most kids are going to be excitable and giddy. Any time we've done a long drive like that (where we get a hotel halfway), we always make sure the hotel has a pool and make sure the kids get some exercise before settling into the room. You also want to make stops during the drive and get them moving. A good stretch, jog in place, potty breaks, some jumping jacks etc \n\nFor today, take a deep breath, get some caffeine for the adults, get to the beach, and enjoy the time with your family.",
            "I would've turned around and drove back today. You need to start smaller and work your way up.\n\nAlso, I'm in my 30s. I sleep absolutely *terribly* in hotel beds. It either requires being super physically exhausted (25k+ steps a day st Disney) or sleep aids. So they may not really get better at sleeping on hotels",
            "This is the start a memorable vacation! The most memorable aren\u2019t the ones where everything goes off w/o a hitch, it\u2019s always the ones that make you try a little harder. With that said, run a lil whiskey along the gums and your husband will be fine! \n\nI know it\u2019s trying rn but you\u2019ll forget all about it when the kids are running around laughing on the beach. Have fun.",
            "It comes with its own set of cons but I suggest driving through the night if either you or your husband are okay doing that. We drive from Indy to St. George Island, FL every year and it\u2019s about the same length a drive as you\u2019re describing. We give the kids some melatonin (the only time we ever give it to them), jump in the car and leave around 11p. I\u2019m a night owl but try to get a few hours sleep before we go and I usually get us to about 4-5a. My wife, who\u2019s an early bird takes over and gets us to breakfast around 8a then we\u2019ve got a 4-5 hour drive with the kids awake. Sometimes we\u2019ll stop for lunch, or just power through and get to the beach and grab some sandwiches there, crack some beers and wait on the Airbnb to open up.",

            "I'm sorry, that is so hard!! Hotel sleep can be hard, but a few things that help us are to leave early so you can stop early and let them play a lot at a pool or park before bedtime. Also, have a really loud sound machine with you to drown out the weird noises of hotels. Beyond that, even though the 2 is kind of young, talk in the car today about how your body feels different sometimes at a different place and how it may take longer to fall asleep so you all can try a strategy...like laying still and taking deep breaths in and out, to calm your bodies down. Sometimes just laying out the expectations that it's normal not to feel normal helps.\u00a0",

We do a week at the beach every year and it's about a 9 hour drive but can be longer with summer time traffic and having to make pit stops. In order to make it easier on us we scheduled the drive there to be a night time road trip. I'd spent the day outside swimming with the kids and doing little adventures to tire them out and my wife would get some sleep so she could be awake to drive. We'd put the kids in pajamas, load them up, and they'd eventually fall asleep during the drive and would normally wake up around the time we got to our destination.",

Autistic men are particularly vulnerable to it. However much self control a regular man has, they have even less, through no fault of their own. Your son NEEDS therapy, and not just psychotherapy but also occupational therapy. You should probably install some sophisticated content-blocking and keystroke technology on his devices (and let him know about it). He literally can't stop this on his own. Privacy be damned at this point, this could ruin his life. The girls he's paying don't give a damn about him and they will bleed him dry.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is what my parents had to resort to, and things have improved.

What\u2019s the limit? Can he always live with you? What happens when you pass away? These are things he needs to plan for, financially and otherwise. Hopefully through this conversation he can open up to you, or you can offer to go over his finances with him. Conversely, you can make it a requirement to continue live with you rent-free. \n\nAlso, young guys need to know that porn is fake and those people are acting and life doesn\u2019t work that way.

Right now, he's obviously had money to burn and he's been burning it. You can put the money to the side and save it up for a down payment when he needs a newer car, to buy furniture if/when he moves out, or spend it on real costs of him living at home like groceries.",

Many of my clients understood more than they were given credit for so it could be worth a try. But you\u2019re the only one who knows him and what he is capable of understanding. \n    \nI would mention how his mail was accidentally opened and you\u2019re worried for his financial heath because of what you saw. That buying porn isn\u2019t necessarily unhealthy, but the extreme way he\u2019s purchasing/consuming it is. And that if he\u2019s not capable of **at least** cutting back his spending on it then he needs to contribute more to the home and start paying rent. Maybe even have a rental agreement printed out ready to have him sign if he won\u2019t, just to show you\u2019re serious.   \n  \nAssuming the worst thing happens, he doesn\u2019t stop, it continues, it escalates, I would consider talking with a lawyer about arranging some sort of protective arrangement or conservatorship.  \n  \nIf he\u2019s spending so intensely that he\u2019s unable to care for himself, provide for his basic needs like food, sanitation and shelter and won\u2019t work to change it, then he may be in need of a temporary conservatorship. \n\n\n  \nYou mentioned that you were worried about angering him. Does he lash out physically?  \nI would have the conversation with multiple people present to help with safety, like dad or grandma. I know this can be an embarrassing discussion but you should put your safety first if it\u2019s a concern.",

You need to be tactful, and also admit that it was wrong of your mother to do what she did, but you do need to be honest. Do NOT demonize him, be judgmental, or threaten to make him homeless-an addiction involves complex brain chemistry changes that are almost impossible to overcome with sheer force of will alone. It will be doubly so for him, because his autism means his brain chemistry is already changed.

Your son is living at home and working part-time due to autism, so is the goal for him to save up money to live independently or is he going to live with you indefinitely? It sounds like you might need family therapy to have these discussions if you haven't already. \n\nOpening his bank statements behind his back makes it seem like there's resentment or concern over the living arrangements that's not being faced head-on. IMO either end goal it's appropriate to ask him to share his bank statements as a condition of living with you. If he's saving to leave home, he needs to show you that he's making progress. If he's living with you indefinitely, he can contribute to household costs if he has enough money to buy porn.\n\nYour family needs to decide (probably with a professional), if you need to police him as a disabled adult by controlling his finances and online access or if he's functional enough to be treated as an independent adult, in which case your control only extends to conditions for his temporary living situation and giving him advice, one adult to another.",

It's the involvement with one or several girls, buying them gifts, buying their time to talk to them, special private pictures, etc. These girls are very good at making a man feel special. Add the fact that he is autistic which is a social disorder, that makes people often have black and white thinking and be more gullible than others, it can be a huge problem to convince him he doesn't actually have a personal relationship with these girls. Hell, it's hard to convince even grown neurotypical men, lol Never mind the fact that a lot of times, especially if it's a bigger creator, these girls are not even actually talking to these guys, they pay a team to do all the interactions.\n\nThat or he has a very specific taste. Furries are well known to spend thousands of dollars on furry porn. Maybe he is into a certain character or God knows what.",
            "It is dehumanizing to all involved\u2026.  Porn is such a blight on society, and that\u2019s not even saying anything about him living rent free and spending 18 thousand dollars on it",
            "\"might\"",
            "I agree with the sentiment, but not the conclusion. Only because my father ended up half a million dollars in debt and a lot of it was paying for p0rn. So some people never do learn the lesson.",
            "This isn't a financial literacy issue, it's a self control issue.",
            "He has a job and no expenses.",
            "Or into a sock\u2026",
            "The emphasis should absolutely not be solely on financial literacy.. porn addiction is real and very serious. She should absolutely care about it and get him help bc that\u2019s insane. Its no different than if he spent 18,000 on gambling. It\u2019s an addiction and leads you down a dangerous path. Yeah obv financially but also mentally. He\u2019s prob spending hours a day jacking off",
            "But she is paying for it. She is letting him live with her on the contingency that he is building a good life for himself. That plan is failing because he clearly has an addiction. Porn addiction is crippling. It sapps your dopamine and self worth. It turns women into sex objects. I am saying this as a WOMAN who watched porn for 2+ hours DAILY. The pursuit of a numb mind can destroy your life.\u00a0\n\n\nI am not saying he needs to hit \"rock bottom\" but that he needs a reality check.\u00a0",
            "What?!?! He loves in her home and isn't supporting himself. Good grief!",
            "Cam girls/parasocial porn is generally not free.",

            "There was a contestant on Drag Race (a man) who was hired to chat as a woman for Only Fans. These women make so much money that they have employees.",
            "That was a great (but depressing) read - thanks for posting!",
            "what a read! thanks for sharing",
            "omg that article fucking broke me. Its so sad.",
            "I mean it depends on how high his needs are. If his spending is that compulsive then OP needs to get power of attorney/conservatorship so she can control his finances, or care for him financially for the rest of her life.",
            "That\u2019s a pretty big leap? How do you know it\u2019s his only comfort?",
            "Whether he has autism or not, saying this to someone who spent thousands of dollars on porn won't solve anything.  But it still needs to be said . . .",
            "Can't spend money on it if he's made to move out and pay his own rent, bills, groceries etc. Right now all of his money is disposable income from the sounds of it - he lives with mom rent free, she never mentioned him contributing to any household expenses, she gave him a car, and I wouldn't be surprised if she's also paying for his cell phone too.",
            "Sounds just like addiction regardless of autism. Addiction will absolutely do that",
            "Consuming porn isn't an activity that should be treated judgment-free. Loads of porn is full of non-consenual acts being performed on women, feature underage girls, contain rape, etc. Women and girls are exploited in its creation, and we should be stigmatizing the casual consumption of online porn.\n\nThe way you are describing it would be applicable of OP's son were like 13 years old and struggling with exposure to online porn. We're talking about her adult son who's living at home rent free spending thousands of dollars on the stuff.",
            "where did you get that from?",
            "She\u2019s asking how to approach him without him getting angry or her mom getting in trouble for invading his privacy. Where in that did you get that she doesn\u2019t care?",
            "Reaching much?",
            "Seriously. There seems to be a decent amount of info online, but I don't think I've ever seen an actual physical resource, and even the online info can be so contradictory and confusing. You almost have to get a doctoral degree in neurological disorders to have a clue. It's so sad how many parents out there are just flying blind in the dark.\u00a0\n\n\nI think it doesn't help that those who have autistic children who are now adults were raising those children in a time when autism as a whole was so poorly understood, and still being denied as a legitimate disorder by a lot of professionals. Parents who have autistic young kids now have access to better information and resources so they'll be better prepared as those kids age, but my parents' generation is still so uneducated. Even my parents are. I was the one who had to encourage them to take a more hands-on approach with my brother's addictions, and explain to them why it was necessary. Before that, their thinking was just that because he was autistic, there was nothing to be done and he had to be left alone.\u00a0",
            "I don't know about specifically for parents of adult autistic people, but one of the major problems with autism resources in general is that there's such a range of understanding and misinformation and approaches and even the recognition of autistic people as potentially competent individuals that it's hard to know what organization to trust and which resources to work with.",
            "Oh 100% it's just... she typed all this out and doesn't see any of that, so I'm not sure what to say.",
            "This is almost guaranteed to be paying for parasocial relationships.\n\nThe less satisfying his real-world relationships are, the more tempting it's going to be to take the \"easy way\" and pay for \"friends\" and fake affection.\n\nHe doesn't need free porn, he needs activities he enjoys where he can have fulfilling interactions with other people.\n\nLook up HealthGamerGG on YouTube - he has a lot of good content going into the psychological mechanisms at play, potential downsides, and ideas for more healthy alternatives.",
            "I wonder if it could be related with his autism not helping in the love department. Idk, 20yo not able to date because of the worlds view of autistic people could be causing low self esteem. No GFs, internet is easy to find people like that, money to spare? \n\nHe could just be lonely.",
            "You never want to say for certain that something is an addiction with only a Reddit post. OP might be leaving details out for whatever reason.",

            "My father has ruined his and by proxy my mother\u2019s life because he can\u2019t control himself. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had to deal with this too.",

Or fantasy/sci-fi, because those worlds leave room for us to be ourselves without question. Porn is fantasy.\u00a0",

It's like when someone gets some wine at a fancy dinner for celebrating an important wedding anniversary. It's just a nice treat, nothing more. However, the amounts that the son is spending definitely makes me lean more towards addiction.\u00a0\n\n\nIf it is addiction, judgemental behavior will only make it worse.
