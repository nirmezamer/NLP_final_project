            "Thanks for saving me one dollar a month!",
            "Spotify has audiobooks?",
            "I got the email earlier today, it was confusing. So you're raising my price... but then you're also offering me a cheaper plan that's the same price i used to pay, with all of the same functionality i was previously using, but i need to manually select it... the \"tyranny of the default setting\" ladies and gentlemen. Spotify just made hundreds of millions of dollars from people who don't check their email and don't care about audiobooks.\n\n\nIs this a \"dark pattern\"?",
            "Take out everything except music. We golden.",
            "Spotify launched the new audiobooks option and automatically migrated every user to it, in order to claim subscribers were paying for a \u201cbundle.\u201d It was a crass attempt at a workaround to avoid paying songwriters and music publishers a couple hundred million dollars this year. And now songwriters and publishers are suing the bejeezus out of them. Source: I know things. Go back to the music only tier because it\u2019s a buck cheaper, sure, but also because it will ultimately substantially help songwriters.

            "Could we also make one without Joe Rogan, so Spotify can save whatever gazillion dollars? It feels like not paying billions for a single podcaster would help \"to become a profitable\".\n\nI don't know the stats, but i doubt that many people come to Spotify for podcasts or audiobooks.",
            "Where's hifi? Lossless audio..... Still don't have it.\u00a0",
            "I'm not sure if I just haven't been paying attention and am somehow grandfathered in, but I'm still on a Premium Individual plan that seems to come with Hulu - the new plan comparison layout doesn't seem to show hulu on that plan moving forward when the price goes up, and it looks like I'd lose that along with the audiobooks thing if I downgrade to the basic individual. Anyone know what the story is with that?",
            "I get audio books?",
            "Podcasts are coming next",
            "That's one way to put it. Another way is that they increased rates for everyone's current plans.",
            "Glad I\u2019ve seen this. Thank you. Just changed mine to the basic duo. \u00a32 a month cheaper.",
            "I already don\u2019t have access to audiobooks lol were they supposed to be included? I thought we had to pay extra for that shit",
            "I would pay more to remove audiobooks, podcasts, and sponsored recommendations",
            "Now do it with podcasts and I\u2019ll come back",
            "Why the fuck can\u2019t I change my plan in the app",
            "Can they get rid of the podcasts too? That'd be sweet, I'm honestly sick of them recommending me podcasts.",
            "Still a worse deal than Tidal",
            "Wait, spotify had audiobooks?",
            "Hey, just a pro tip in case anyone from spotify reads this. You probably should have offered this tier when you raised prices originally.",
            "That's great. I'd happily pay the same as I already paid if they only added a switch to remove all podcasts/audiobooks from my feed. But now I'll move to the cheaper option, making you lose a dollar a month instead...",
            "Spotify became a greedy company, family plan doesn't work as intended, free plan doesn't work in the app.... It's a shame when companies get to this point to be honest, Netflix Spotify, who will be next?",
            "My market doesn't even have audiobooks. I wish they removed podcasts though.",
            "I was just thinking how pissed I was that it went up when I don't want any of that audio book or pod cast shit at all. I don't want to be paying the fucking Joe Rogan tax. I'd like to opt out of all that in the app itself so it stops cluttering up my music.",
            "Spotify has audiobooks?",
            "This is the last price increase for my family. Going to self host my library from here on out.",
            "Wait it costs 10.99 per month? Happy i never listen music with it so far...",
            "I want a plan without adverts in podcasts, that spotify claim is nothing to do with them despite clearly being coded for their platform and for them to bring back the discover feature.",
            "My techs big version doesnt have audiobooks either. But the app works great and is free n pirated. Come get me officers",
            "my spotify has audiobooks? wtf",
            "I had a friend tell me to get off spotify years ago and damn i am glad to have listened to them. Every single time I have used Spotify since or heard anything else it has become so much worse and only more expensive.",
            "If there was a higher priced plan for more audiobook time I\u2019d take it.",
            "This is a smart move. Music-only for a lower price sounds perfect. Would consider switching to this plan!",
            "spotify has audio books?",
            "I use something called xManager which gives me the same thing",
            "Made the switch to Apple Music after 10 years with Spotify. Wish I\u2019d done it sooner.",
            "Get a library card and you\u2019ll have access to tons of free audiobooks on Hoopla and Libby. :)",
            "Spotify never had audiobooks here in Denmark. Must be too hard to send them all the way from Sweden.",
            "I\u2019m pretty sure I lose my Hulu tie-in subscription if I change my Spotify subscription. So, $12 a year it is.",
            "Spotify are the worst.",
            "Honestly, the 15 hours/month limit is kind of off-putting. There's probably some licensing / anti-piracy reason behind it. And it might be plenty (someone cited it being ~2 books per month). But I use Spotify Premium probably 150 hours or more per month (basically always have music on at work). So 15 hours feels like a drop in the bucket.\n\nAnd if I'm listening to audiobooks, it's usually because I'm on a long car trip that could easily exceed 15 hours round-trip, so it's not even enough for that.\n\nSome opportunity to \"splurge\" to something like 50 hours per month would be nice. Maybe just allow unused hours to accumulate up to some limit?",
            "This may get lost in the shuffle but I don't understand something with the family plans. There's  Premium Family, and Basic Family. The basic one says it doesn't come with audiobooks, which I'm fine with, but it also says that it has 6 \"Basic\" accounts. None of the other options I'm looking at describe what a \"basic\" account is. Can anyone explain? Is this still a \"premium account\" but named \"basic\" so I don't pick it?",
            "F$ck Spotify.\n' And every other ensh$tification based business",
            "Times like this make me really appreciate the streaming app \"Nuclear\".",
            "There are audio books?",
            "Nice since my audiobooks dont work offline anyways",
            "For as long as that shit Ek is in charge and they keep giving money to military drone technology used in warfare...I'll stick with Tidal.",
            "They have audiobooks?",
            "\u2026 there\u2019s audiobooks on Spotify?",
            "Redditors will never be happy all they do is whine and complain about everything. It's beyond toxic. You have all the music in the world at your fingertips for $10 a month and they STILL find something to fucking cry about.",
            "They are so corrupt and greedy \nEven as a casual artist even if I do make their bare minimum streams to earn the payout is still shit \nI hate capitalism",
            "Wait there are audio books on Spotify?",
            "Spotify had audiobooks?",
            "Spotify has audiobooks?!?\n\nHow do I browse through them?",
            "There were audiobooks?",
            "Too late.  Fuck you.\n\nMy sub just lapsed.  I fired up the free version: never again.  It's dead to me.  Two songs then 3 or 4 adverts, and it's the same ads on repeat.\n\nI didn't think I'd go back to the days of \"Napstering\" my music, yet here we are.",
            "But thats 10k in your pocket every 833 years",
            "They actually raised the rate of your current plan; you have to opt for the cheaper plan to get less than what you used to pay for.",
            "I just love I saw people recently expressing they wanted this. I assume they thought it might have a bigger discount though.",
            "This is the reason why gen Z is not able to afford housing. Spending frivolously on an additional dollar a month on audiobook.",
            "But when they make it a dollar more people rage and hell is open.\nNow it is even bad when they make it cheaper. C mon, decide what you want music guys.",
            "Shows you what they actually think of their non-music offerings!",
            "Lol for real? 10.99 a month for completely unlimited music is an absolute steal. Literally the cost of a decent sandwich at a cheaper restaurant and you get unlimited music. They should be charging $20 a month at least. The only criticism is they should be paying artists more",
            "I mean when you put it like that!",
            "Wait, how much you guys paying? I'm paying 3rd world country prices at $2.50 a month. A dollar off would be even more awesome.",
            "And still not paying artists fairly.",
            "I don\u2019t think audiobooks are available globally. I think only a few regions have audiobooks.\n\n>The service is available in several countries including the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand\u00a0",
            "A good selection too. At least for me. They have pretty much all the stephen king and dean koontz audiobooks for example. Also Neil Gaiman. Personally I think it's worth.",
            "IIRC they had the most batshit pricing for it. Instead of getting a book a month like audible, you got 10 \"free\" listening hours per month, which didn't not roll over and you had to buy more hours if you wanted to keep listening without waiting till the next month to give you 10 more \"free\" hours. Had to have been thought up by some exec to whom not just audiobooks but books in general are a very abstract concept.",
            "Yeah, not as many as some other platforms, but I've got through about 40 in the last 8-9 months.",
            "The local public library likely does too, for free",
            "TIL!",
            "Learned it right now as well lol",
            "And you can stream video podcasts. Also, they have tons of music in other languages. These things I didn't know until recently. I thought they just stream US music.",
            "It definitely confused me, I thought the basic family plan was significantly more...basic than the premium. Like I'd loose the ability to download music and set up a que. So glad I read this!",
            "If it was full access to audio books I would be down but 15 hours will take me a couple of months to finish a book",
            "You still have to pay for a lot of the audiobooks. I'm listening to Dune free in dutch. God damn dutch man. I tellyawhat.",
            "The cheaper one had ads, no?",
            "Does anyone know the difference between the new Premium Family and Basic Family?  I currently have Family and I can't tell if Basic Family would still allow local download caching.  We don't care about audiobooks, but they show that we would have 6 Basic accounts instead of 6 Premium accounts.  The term \"Basic\" isn't mentioned anywhere else, other than under that family plan.\n\nhttps://www.spotify.com/us/premium/#plans",
            "Its weird that they did it so quickly. Usually companies let the dust settle before introducing the new cheaper plan that's shittier than the old one.",
            "Btw, it\u2019s preferred to be called a \u2018deceptive pattern\u2019 across the UX industry. In part because \u201cdark\u201d has been moreso adopted for \u2018dark mode\u2019 settings, and the phrase \u2018dark pattern\u2019 deriving from questionable origins in tech culture with racial undertones. Similarly with \u2018whitelist\u2019 and \u2018blacklist\u2019, \u2018master suites\u2019, etc being phased out over time with better alternatives.\n\nAlso helps that \u2018deceptive pattern\u2019 explains what it is a bit better as well.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Upvoting since this is the real story behind these bundles.",
            "I just cancelled.  Two price increases in the same period doesn\u2019t feel very consumer focused.  They also dont have hi-rez audio despite saying they do on the plans page.  Other options are far better at this point.",
            "Hell, I'd pay extra for one without Joe Rogan lol",
            ">\n>I don't know the stats, but i doubt that many people come to Spotify for podcasts or audiobooks. \n\nI was one of those people but then I discovered Egyptian History Podcast and now I am a convert",
            "Seriously! Sign me up for the no Joe Rogan tier, guy is a total buffoon & a plague on society",
            "You know you don't have to listen to Joe Rogan right? \n\nFriendly reminder that Spotify is ten fucking dollars a month to listen and download unlimited music.",
            "I understand Apple Music has it but I genuinely don\u2019t think hifi is worth the file size and spending extra if they want to go that route. And that\u2019s if you can even tell the difference, not everyone can.",
            "It\u2019s coming and it\u2019ll be an extra $4 a month",
            "I got Hulu like a decade ago with Spotify premium and just checked, still grandfathered in!!",
            "I think it depends when you got grandfathered! Lost my student discount in 2019 but still have had Hulu for free in my Spotify bundle since then.",
            "If you're on a student plan and no longer a student, you'll lose Hulu. I did when I graduated.",
            "That is the case, yeah - if you change your plan, you'll lose the free (ad tier) Hulu. We just updated to Duo - a more expensive tier of course - and Hulu was removed. They do tell you you'll lose Hulu if you click to see what will change, at least.",
            "You get 15 hours of listening to audio books a month, which is roughly 1.5-2.5 books on average from the ones I've looked at. I've actually really been enjoying the audio book feature cause spotify has about any book you can think of, and I wanted to try them before, but could never justify paying 20+ dollars for just a single audio book.",
            "God I hope so",
            "I did. Go to settings, then click account. Should take 10s",
            "Because they won't want to pay Apple. Technically you can't subscribe through the iOS app to avoid apple's cut.",
            "Plexamp is great",
            "I quit and went to Apple Music 3 months ago. Haven't missed anything on Spotify.",
            "What a ridiculous entitlement. For the price of a cheap sandwich you're getting completely unlimited music and podcasts for 10.99. That is an absolute steal, and anyone 20-30 years ago would be mind blown by that. We're lucky they aren't charging $30 a month and paying artists more.",
            "Good luck lol",
            "commies getting mad at an option.\n\nyou can still sell your music with every other way before spotify",
            "You go to the search tab in the app.\n\nStart Browsing - Audiobooks",
            "Is it?",
            "One should not neglect to factor in the compounding interest from investing the $1 each month.",
            "Sorry I couldn\u2019t help myself as this is such a good way to show the benefits of compound interest.\n\n$1 invested a month in a 8 percent annual return account (standard S&P 500 return) would net you $10,000 in 53 years.\n\nIt would take 197 years to earn a million.\u00a0",
            "Very true but a dollar is a dollar. Wouldn\u2019t have known without this post!",
            "It's not less stuff because I wasn't using it anyway.\n\nBut also, yeah it's dumb",
            "Hey they gotta give that sweet $350 million to Rogan and also think of the poor shareholders...",
            "Also not that Spotify is the greatest, most ethical company in the world, but they\u2019ve successfully managed to get all of music in one centralized place. They\u2019ve essentially maintained what Netflix used to have, which is create a library of all forms of media that you could possibly want. For the price point equivalent of buying 13 albums, you can get a years subscription to all the music in the world.\n\nArtists complain about streaming screwing them over because by all means this product should cost *more*. I think Spotify should tweak certain ways that they distribute payment to artists, but even other streaming services that really commit to being artist first like Tidal don\u2019t actually manage to pay artists a significant amount of money, because *streaming itself is inherently cheaper than it should be*.",
            "Don't give them ideas with how much they're shafting artists, 10.99 is plenty.",
            "Yeah it\u2019s wild. I don\u2019t think people who grew up after CDs realise we used to spend circa \u00a312 on one album.",
            "Nah, they shouldn't be charging anywhere near that much as long as they have that abomination they call shuffle. Both smart and normal suck. Somehow we managed to figure out shuffle ages ago so I have to assume they prioritize whatever costs them the least.",
            "And only certain books are included too, some are locked away behind another paywall.\n\nYou also only get a certain number of hours per month.",
            "TIL I have audiobooks on Spotify.",
            "But as I just found out while at work yesterday, it's [limited to 15 hours of listening per month](https://i.imgur.com/G25nZEl.png), which isn't close to enough for me.",
            "Is there like a list? I find it so hard to find audiobooks that are \u201cfree\u201d with premium",
            "Yea I started listening to Shogun on it after watching the show. It was rented out at all my local libraries and completely forgot I could just listen to it on Spotify",
            "they got the Andy Serkis LOTR, too",
            "Lol. Spotify isn't even a US company.",
            "And then if you want to top up it\u2019s a pound an hour. Insane pricing",
            "I had no idea there were free audiobooks. Anything good?",
            "Those BIKIN dutch!",
            "Two kinds of people I can't stand: those who are intolerant of other people's cultures... and the Dutch.",
            "1\u20ac more but unlimited audiobooks would be an insane, too good to be true deal honestly.\n\nBut as it stands I think the price hike is unwarranted. You still have to pay more, so what's the point? Paying more so you can pay even more? Hard pass.",
            "No, neither of the premium tier offerings have ads.",

            "\"download\". I don't use Spotify but I guarantee it's encrypted/DRM'd to hell and back. No way they're letting you keep whatever you want if/when you decide to cancel.",
            "Guys getting downvoted for telling the truth",
            "I dont know why you are getting downvoted so much. Why do people hate Joe Rogan so much? I agree that its like 10 bucks a month for unlimited music. I used to pay 20 bucks for an album and most the time 80% of the album sucked ass. I sold all my CDs for a buck a piece and never looked back. Owning music in this day and age is silly.",
            "Yea it\u2019s 100% worth it tbh. I bought into the \u201cyou can\u2019t even tell the difference\u201d camp for a while til I actually tried it out. There\u2019s a big difference. And now everyone\u2019s offering lossless at the same price with Spotify holding out",

Seriously, when folks hate Stephen King it genuinely makes me wonder just how much they read. There's a metric fuck ton of bad books out there, an absolute shit load, and despite that, Stephen King finds a way to write a decent book every year. Yes, some of his books are bad. But some are incredible works of fiction that will be analyzed by college and high school readers for the better part of what I can guess is a century.\n\nI know it's kinda shitty to speak in absolutes but if you unironically think King is a bad writer, then I have to assume you're not much of a reader at all, because even folks that don't care for Kings prose or subject matter typically still consider him fantastic",

            "Eminem trying to go back to the Slim Shady personae would be a major regression for him personally and artistically. Slim Shady rapped about being poor. Eminem has been a millionaire for 20+ years. Slim rapped about drugs. Eminem has been sober for 16 years. Slim rapped about his problems with his mom and Kim. Eminem is 51 years old, his daughter Hailey is almost 30 and she's a married woman now ... he doesn't need to keep beefing with his elderly mom and his ex-wife in 2024. So, what the hell could a 51 year old Slim Shady write about? Rap beefs? Fantasies of violence? Some pop culture references? It just wouldn't hit the same in 2024.\n\nHe wrote most of the songs on the Slim Shady LP before he met Dr Dre, when he was pretty much a nobody. When he was a broke 25 year old rapper with a baby daughter. It made sense that he was angry as fuck. He wrote the Marshall Mathers LP as a response to sudden and unexpected fame. He was still only 28 years old, still had a young daughter, still trying to reconcile his new fame and fortune with his old life and conflicts with Kim and his mom. Again, it made sense that he was still holding on to a lot of anger in response to all the new criticism he was facing as a pop star, as a white rapper, etc. And he continued to milk that successful Slim Shady personae through Eminem Show and Encore. Trying to go back to that old well at 51 would be sad as fuck.",

I\u2019ll try to explain my perspective for you so you can maybe relate:\n\nSSLP and MMLP are classics, no debate. I played them endlessly as a teenager and can still go back and enjoy them now. But Eminem does not rap like that anymore.\n\nHis style started shifting all the way back in \u201802, and by the time he made his comeback with Relapse and Recovery it was as if he was an entirely different artist.\n\nThe smooth, high-pitched raps of Role Model, JDGAF, etc. were replaced with shouty, staccato flows; the effortless/straightforward, shock-value bars of his old stuff gave way to forced rhymes that didn\u2019t feel clever, funny, or shocking (the bornana line comes to mind).\n\nAnything post-\u201809 I just can\u2019t get into at all. Including Houdini, which has an Eminem Show style beat (cool) but the actual rapping just isn\u2019t the same (not for me).\n\nBut that original Slim Shady era is still golden to me, so I can ignore anything he dropped after that period. Unless, of course, he were to dip back into that era and add a new chapter to it\u2026\n\nSo that\u2019s why for me I\u2019d prefer he didn\u2019t bring Shady back. Apologies for the essay - hope that answers your question.",

Eminem still has talent. But he's lost the plot on what to rap about. And that's why they want Slim Shady back, because he was down in the dirt with everyone else trying to get out.",

            "I've only hear Houdini (not sure if there's more) and only once. I liked the Slim Shady era and listened to his stuff quite a bit back in the day. A lot of his older stuff fit right in with the punk music I was mainly listening to as he seemed like some dumb, lost kid trying to make it in a messed up world. He also made fun of a lot of the popular culture at the time, which in the 90s/early 2000s the primary \"villian\" for a lot of the counter culture was the conservative right.\n\nAs someone getting closer to 40 I have the same issue with him that I have with, say, Green Day: do rich popular icons have the same authority to question the popular opinion as some young broke kid? Eminem used to sing against the music industry in a genre that was relatively unpopular, and now he is synonymous with the industry. Same with Green Day not being seen as \"punk\" anymore I struggle to see if Eminem can become Slim Shady again due to his current standing in life.\n\nBack to the counter culture thing. Instead of attempting to rile up conservative views of politicians (yes, I know Clinton was a Democrat, but the conservative views towards music was the main target), he now is making fun...of kids getting participation trophies? How kids are too sensitive these days? I get it but damn, I don't want my Slim Shady to sound like my dad/father in law. But I guess he is right around their age so, maybe I should get ready to complain about them in 10 years.\n\nIt sucks, it's a huge struggle in a lot of music genres. Many love the \"little guy over throwing the corporate giants\" but unfortunately Eminem isn't the little guy anymore. And so it sounds...off putting more than anything. Like if you go to visit your grandpa and he's blasting Eminem. Surreal.",

It just doesn\u2019t work now since Eminem has worked with people like Pink, Beyonc\u00e9, Ed Sheeran, Rihanna, Bruno Mars, Gwen Stefani, Nate Ruess, etc.\u00a0\n\nIn my mind, he is just a Pop artist now. His second half of his catalogue just is way too Poppy for me to consider him a top tier rapper nowadays. His talent is cemented, MMLP is a very iconic album, but I haven\u2019t really thought of him as a Hip-Hop artist in more than a decade, really what has he done that has defined his career since Recovery with Hip-Hop? He\u2019s a rapper but not a Hip-Hop artist, absolutely not a Hip Hop act anymore!\n\nLastly, it\u2019s a Steve Miller sample. From maybe their worst hit, and a specific song that took down the band. And Eminem trying to bring back Slim Shady is almost like watching James Brown trying to score hits in the 80s, it\u2019s not going to work, it\u2019s like dialing back the clock. Slim Shady was a 20 something year old popping pills and being a thug, Eminem in 2024 is 51 years old and has an adult daughter who recently got married. It isn\u2019t the same, and the sample ruins the song.\u00a0",

            "Are people saying this? I've generally only seen positive responses to the new song/video.",
            "Because he\u2019s not that relevant in terms of modern rap culture. The impression I get from people that think Eminem is still hot shit is that they don\u2019t actually make the effort to discover new or independent rappers who are actually good. Most of them just talk shit and say things like \u201call new rap is mumble rap and it\u2019s trash\u201d. It\u2019s just a very boomer mindset where people are stuck in their old ways. Eminem was good at one point in time but he\u2019s very mainstream and for people that grew up appreciating underground and independent stuff it\u2019s just kinda meh. Sure he\u2019s good at rapping but personally his music is just very underwhelming compared to stuff I would normally listen to.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m gonna put a recommendation in here. Go listen to bones. He\u2019s one of the greatest rappers of this generation. If you think Eminem is hardcore(lol) bones makes Eminem seem soft, and he has way more range and probably 1000 more songs.",

He\u2019s a multi-millionaire who could live happily never putting out anything again. He seems to only rap these days about how amazing he is, cringy bars about picking up women and weird exaggerated tracks about his upbringing (which we\u2019ve all heard before, only better).\n\n\nSlim Shady worked because he was so of his time and it felt relevant the way that he criticised pop culture.

            "I think The Force Awakens did as well as it did partly because the prequels disappointed. It promised a fresh start and some of the ideas were pretty cool on paper. But to address your point, there's a fun statistic that The Blair Witch Project is in a sense the most profitable movie ever. The gross wasn't especially high but the costs were so low that they made their money back many times over. So that's my personal response, ROI matters to me more than absolute profit.\n\nBut let's get past me. If ROI is the most tangible but ultimately soulless metric, what are the more interesting ones? I'd offer two. The first is quality. It's hard to explain but you know it when you see it. The question is, did they just make another movie or did they make something special? Did this just distract people and make a buck or did it somehow enrich them? I'd offer my favorite children's movie as an example, \"The Secret of Nimh\". If you haven't seen that, it's a bizarre beautifully animated movie about just how far a mother mouse will go for her sick child. She ventures from what she knows into strange and terrifying circumstances that she's completely incapable of managing, risking her own life because it's the only thing she can do. It's a great movie and I'll always think of it fondly even if I last saw it as a little boy.\n\nThe other less tangible metric is influence or groundwork. Sometimes a movie fails but the failure itself contains something special or exciting. Sometimes the movie is ahead of its time. Maybe they pioneer a new technique. Maybe it failed for circumstances outside the filmmaker's control. The laziest example I can give for this is Citizen Kane. It's all old story now, people think of it as a masterpiece but it underperformed when it came out. William Hearst, an inspiration for Kane, was an exceptionally rich and powerful man. He threw the weight of his empire at the movie and it took time for people to come to appreciate it. Citizen Kane popularized a lot of directing techniques we now take for granted and moved filmmaking forward in a big way. Sure, it turned a profit eventually and that makes it successful. But that's not why it's special.\n\nEdit: here's a scene from \"The Secret of Nimh\". This blew my mind as a kid because Mrs. Brisby, the heroine, isn't some kind of warrior and the scary rat isn't a bad guy. She doesn't gather her courage and overcome him, she runs because he's huge and violent and has a sci-fi lightning spear. She tries to explain things to him and then just books it because he's not listening. A later scene reframes it, he's just the guard. He scares the hell out of trespassers because it's kinder than hurting them. He doesn't get any lines but his boss is a real good guy and goes to great lengths to help her. If anything, he's the hero of the story, the brave warrior. But even if he's the hero, the story isn't about him. This is a story about a mom; the monsters, heroes, mystics and villains are just along for the ride.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SI_DOVqlJA4?feature=shared",

Several critics have noted that Eminem from '99-04 had the luxury of not having to imitate conventional or stereotypical ideas of \"black\" hyper-masculine bravado during rap's first commercial height ([just look at why Otherwize was turned down by Dr. Dre for refusing to \"simplify\" his music and adopt a west coast \"gangster\" persona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0IR1ptOp1M)).\n\nYou can definitely hear stylistic similarities between *Kamikaze*/*Relapse*\\-era Eminem and artists like Tech N9ne, Royce da 5'9\", Logic, Token, Joyner Lucas, NF, etc. You can tell Eminem has tried to \"modernize\" his music on his last few LPs.\n\nIf you look at Eminem's career over the decades, especially from '88-'97, you can see how much he's pulled from other artists like Redman, Pacewon, Percee P, Pharoahe Monch, Proof, Esham, Big Daddy Kane, 2Pac, Big L, etc. Even his more underground peers like R.A. the Rugged Man, Cage, Louis Logic, Slug, Copywrite, Pigeon John, Elzhi, Gift of Gab, Chino XL, and Rhymefest were similar to him in a lot of ways.\n\n>I wish there was new stuff that sounded like them\n\nYou're not looking in the right places. That's the problem.",

The vast majority who'd likely be pretty alright with Nickleback and \"like\" their music well enough. Well enough to fill stadium after stadium?\n\nIt's fine if you hate their music. But your hate isn't going to change the reality that enough people \"like\" Nickleback that the minority of that grouping that \"love\" Nickleback probably outnumber the following of an annoyingly large number of \"better\" bands.",
            "I mean, pulling out another Top 40 band, but a decade earlier, isn't exactly proving you out to be a music nerd either. More old man yells at clouds vibes.\n\nAnd yeah, if someone asked me for cartoon recommendations, I wouldn't start off by saying they should watch this show called The Simpsons. Frankly, The Simpsons doesn't need the help, if someone is asking I can generally assume they've gone through the starter pack shows, and if I'm gonna gush over something, I'd do it over The Thief and The Cobbler, Secret of the Kells, or Don Hertzfeldt.

            "I get the principle. But studios screw up all the time. If Titanic hadn't been a top 5 it could have brought Fox down altogether, so your hypothetical example has probably happened.\n\nWhat throws people off is that studios are incredibly tightfisted about some things and then turn around and spend like crazy on others. People always have stories like, \"I was a prop manager for X years and we accounted for every penny!\" Ok, m8. But someone else on your project lost an entire truck and bought a new one with \"discretionary funds\". It's a chaotic industry.",
            "Aye, I understand that. Like I said, nothing wrong with hating their music.\n\nMy point isn't really about understanding why someone else might like Nickleback.\n\nBut rather that your own hate for Nickleback is coming from a niche interest in music that isn't shared by the majority of people. Which means that you can't really extrapolate your experience to them. Especially in the face of basic knowledge of their popularity (enough to constantly be on tour).\n\nAnd if you try to extrapolate anyways, you end up contorting logic to justify why they must be unpopular (even though they're clearly popular) or why no-one would go out of their way to listen to them (even though they go out of their way to book concerts) and other such logical contortions that will seem obvious to everyone else.\n\nIts further complicated by the fact that hating Nickleback has become a meme now. Like, I too hated Nickleback for many years. Before I realized that I barely knew any Nickleback songs, that I actually kinda liked the ones I knew, and couldn't point to a single one which I thought was outright bad. And people who've fallen for the meme (internet folk mostly) can make it difficult to discern if Nickleback actually *is* popular or not. (which is why a data point like concerts are a good means towards making an informed guess.)"

            "Drake and Kendrick Lamar have had beef under the table with sneak disses for a long ass time. Finally it blew up into real beef and they started releasing tracks explicitly dissing each other. Kendrick is WIDELY considered to have won the beef by releasing better music and having his allegations towards Drake hold up more in the court of public opinions. Drake accused Kendrick of being a wife beater but there was no proof and Kendrick accused drake of being a pedophile and sex trafficker and there are tons of videos and interviews of Drake doing weird shit with minors, has song lyrics talking about how hot high schoolers are, and was weirdly close with a few young teenage celebrities including Millie Bobby Brown. This song is called Not Like Us and was the kill shot of the whole beef and it's a song calling Drake a pedophile that was designed to have summer anthem vibes so it would pop off super hard.",
            "Oh! Oh! Fellow old person here. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve pieced together:\nAt some point, Drake incurred the wrath of Kendrick Lamar. About a month or so ago, there was a trading of diss tracks between them. This song was one of the tracks.\n\nJust adding, I don\u2019t really listen to either, but even I, old person, know that Drake is popular, Kendrick is gifted. I know this simply from having the bare minimum knowledge of pop culture right now. Why Drake got into it with him at all is beyond me.",

I was like \"hey, why the fuck did you say you'd be in that loser's book anyway tho?\" Drake is nothing more than white girl and Armenian rapper boy zeitgeist. That's it... that's Drake's club.\n\nAnyway, I also asked that dude when I still honored his dumbass with my time and breath, if DJ Khaled was joking about how much he likes Drake and he told me it's not an act... that Khaled really does like Drake that much. Snapchat meme rapper taste, I guess. \n\nAlright, y'all, fuck that dude I dated, he was a sniveling little cowardly shit and I dunno if that Drake book came out with the art or whatever...

He got taken to court where they settled the issue about an alleged baby where they didn\u2019t provide a paternity test and REN passed a polygraph. I can\u2019t find where you got this Dre part from, either way yes some of our favorite rappers did fucked up shit, doesn\u2019t make what Drake did any better.\n\nEdit: I found the case https://www.forbes.com/sites/legalentertainment/2016/10/21/surviving-defamation-michelle-dr-dre-the-law/\n\nObviously Dre sent a cease and desist letter claiming defamation, Michelle says she doesn\u2019t have proof of the allegation although she claims to have had plastic surgery on her nose. If I\u2019m being honest I believe Michelle Dre has had similar allegations in the past and he released a statement almost explaining as much \n\n\u201cTwenty-five years ago I was a young man drinking too much and in over my head with no real structure in my life\u2026However, none of this is an excuse for what I did. I\u2019ve been married for 19 years and every day I\u2019m working to be a better man for my family, seeking guidance along the way. I\u2019m doing everything I can so I never resemble that man again.\u201d\n\nLike Kendrick stated before \u201cI am not your savior\u201d these people are painfully human and powerful, the difference I seem to see in the case between Drake and Dre is that the culture has forgiven Dre and Drake obviously needs more time to\u2026. \u201cGrow\u201d. If you\u2019re really concerned about your favorite rapper being perfect paragons of society I suggest you look inwardly to measure yourself. As far as the Drake and Kendrick beef both camps have questionable people representing them (manny Fresh,J Prince) the main difference between them is Kendrick is a better artist and writer in every way possible way. The culture has clearly chosen a winner. Your favorite artists and people are very flawed and you have to choose who and what you\u2019re okay with, the secret is we\u2019re all Hypocrites.",

For example Kendrick was very hard on himself for killing a another black kid when he was sixteen over gang ties whereas most rappers would brag about killing someone. The reason he went so hard at Drake for his faults is because Drake went to fight dirty and Kendrick basically said \u201cI have way more tea to spill on you than you have on me.\u201d For example Drake\u2019s only ammunition was an allegation that Kendrick hit a woman back in 2014 by some random chick and Drake spun it to try and make Kendrick look like a wife beater. Meanwhile, Drake went through the exact same thing except the woman took him to court for raping her and Drake settled outside of court for a few hundred thousand. Kendrick didn\u2019t even use that angle, only hinted at it on euphoria because he had SO MUCH more than that on Drake that was more substantiated like his right hand man Baka being convicted of beating his girlfriend and forcing her into prostitution.",

            "It\u2019s interesting that while your statement is true, the reason for $1000 tickets is still primarily driven by the \u201cdown on their luck would be millionaires\u201d. Aka the middle class income, lower class wealth groups who wants to chase hype.\n\nNot sure if technology or people inability to quickly adjust to technology is to blame. But I came from a family who can not go on vacation for 3 years, and live a decade like that to build wealth. Whereas now people literally live pay check to pay check. And they can\u2019t save $10000 before wanting to reward themselves.",
            "Artists agree to it but misleading to say they set the price. The biggest issue is that there is no real alternative to Ticketmaster and live nation. They have a monopoly on any live music tour outside of small clubs. They also own most of the small clubs.\n\nIt\u2019s not like artists have much of a choice. You either work with Ticketmaster or you try to create an entire new network from scratch and bear the consequence and cost if it goes wrong.",

Don\u2019t act like ticket master/Live nation has their hands off when they are literally in every cookie jar possible when it comes to live entertainment. They make off the initial sale to a bot then again off the resale. Follow the money.",

            "Why shouldn\u2019t artists try to make as much money as they can? Supply and demand. They\u2019re not a charity dude",
            "We can hate the scalpers, but also the promoters, artists, ticket sales and resale vendors for colluding to replace them. But I'd say you're right, even if the ticketmaster/livenation monopoly gets broken up, without specific additional protection, the resale market just moves to someone else. The poor scalpers don't want to talk about that",

In a traditional supply and demand scenario a high demand product or service would result in higher sales and profits for the people providing the product ie: artists and their teams. In this situation thanks to massively increased overheads and a monopoly taking massive cuts in fees etc. artists are making way less while the audience pays way more. All while the biggest monopoly in North America amasses gargantuan profits. It\u2019s a total sham that has little to do with true capitalist markets\u00a0",

            "The complaint is that they are \u201csold out\u201d, yet you can immediately find them being resold for way more than face. Ticketmaster takes another cut of the transaction if the ticket is sold again, so they\u2019re not incentivized to stop scalpers from doing this.",

Ironic that this is also a dating app issue which may affect the same population group.\n\nI say ironic because at the end of the day, it\u2019s either the rich (which they can do w/e) or a bunch of idiot who\u2019s going to screw over their own lives and be in the bottom 50% after their 40s in terms of wealth despite of having an income earlier that could\u2019ve led to a much better life.",

If there are enough whales in your fanbase it makes more money having less people at your show who pay a lot each than more people who pay less each.\n\nThis is also why you see now like 5 tiers of ticket price, because artists dont want to play to empty seats but still want to milk the whales. So theres super mega VIP tickets, VIP tickets, Premium tickets, normal tickets, budget restricted view tickets. Its kind of the best of both world where the people willing to spend outrageous money still pay outrageous money and people with a limited budget still come to fill up a seat that would otherwise be empty",

Scalpers for the most part just exploit the gap between the true market clearing price (where demand and supply meet) and the face value, which is usually below that price. \n\nBut as we\u2019ve seen with several tours this year, and every year, if you don\u2019t have the actual demand, the tickets won\u2019t sell. Neither Ticketmaster nor scalpers can dictate prices\u2026it\u2019s the fans that do that.\n\nFans decided Jennifer Lopez and Black Keys weren\u2019t worth what they (or bots, or scalpers) were charging.\n\nAnd fans decided that Taylor Swift and Olivia Rodrigo tickets were worth *more* than they were charging. \n\nMoney talks.",

            "Neither Ticketmaster nor Live Nation own \u201cmost of the small clubs.\u201d Ticketmaster doesn\u2019t own any clubs as far as I know, but signs exclusive ticketing relationships with venues. And Live Nation ownership is primarily concentrated on amphitheaters. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s misleading at all to say artists set the price. When they agree to platinum ticketing they know exactly what will happen: tickets will sell for the prices that free markets bear out. The one aspect artists can\u2019t control are fees, and those can certainly be excessive. But that\u2019s not what fans were complaining about in this article.",

Live Nation and to a lesser extent AEG offer crazy sums that Indy promoters can\u2019t compete with and of course the artist isn\u2019t going to turn down more money.",
            "What? I don't know who you are trying to protect here but promoters have absolutely NO SAY in ticket prices, the artist does.\n\nAnd that is always the case, ALWAYS.\n\nYou get up votes because people can't possibly conceive their favorite artist is charging that insane amount of money but..they are.",

            "I think both you and the person you are replying to are correct.\n\nA market was created where $1000 tickets are acceptable.\n\nThe market was created by Ticketmaster, a monopoly.\n\nThough the truth is likely in between. Because if you look at the tier 1 cities in China, the concert ticket price to income ratio is also ridiculous. Which simply points to debt and wealth inequality. You have the idiots who don\u2019t own much assets paying 20% of their salary for a concert (then looking for handouts cuz their life is fucked), and the wealth / or their kids to whom $100, $1000, and $5000 are all very acceptable prices.",
            "They still wouldn't be selling for that much if there weren't people willing to pay that price for them. Clearly there are plenty of buyers even at that price.

I am by no means defending Ticketmaster and/or live Nation in the predatory crap they pull but I also think putting the onus on fans to purposely not spend and tell them that they've made difference is naive. The shows will still be packed, the VIP packages will still sell at crazy prices, and those people will still likely enjoy themselves. It needs fixing from the other end",

It's not about what else you could be doing it enjoying your time, it's about whether or not \"voting with your wallet\" has a meaningful and tangible impact on these ticketing companies. My point was that for every one person that OP convinced not to go, there are hundreds of not thousands waiting to spend the same if not more instead\n\nThis is an issue of supply and demand, not an issue of shows being a good time compared to friends or whatever nonsense you're off about",

Ain\u2019t no one wanting to hold the stonk until they die. For scalpers to exist, you still need to want to pay the price. The scalper didn\u2019t take a gun to your head and force the ticket on you.\n\nThis is why no one is going to buy all the vintage products from all the local vintage stores and try to sell it for a higher price.\n\nWhich is also funny because people hate RE agents and supports a more liquid market like Zillow. In a more liquid market, the price will more reflect true supply and demand, and you never want that for an inelastic necessity where supply can be easily constrained in a 3-5 year period.",

            "True, but by your own example it usually involves a lot of fighting by the artist to get any change, and you\u2019d better be a major draw, or else you\u2019re just hurting your own career. \u00a0I recall Pearl Jam led this crusade for many years and while they did fight the good fight, it seemed like one hell of a headache for them.\n\nSo yeah, they\u2019re not completely blameless, but I understand why only a handful of bands have taken up this fight.",
            "Okay, not every artist is going to fight this battle, and if you can sell it out with the dynamic pricing can you explain to me why an artist would lower their price. I decided to wait a week before tickets to a band that had them at $500 I got them from 125 week before. Granted I was risking it, but i still got the seats I wanted however I would have sat anywhere probably.",
            "But when you fight like that and bring down prices, there will absolutely be retaliation. For a pop star who relies on others for beats and lyrics, to have a long career is absolutely about you saying lots of yeses and few nos to people who are making the money.

            "I think his point is that the artists share is only a small proportion, in the older days they would have a promoter book an arena, and they would get a share and it would split the rest, now the promoters book the artist and charge the arena for the service and the arena gets a fee.",
            "While I think defending the artists is idiotic, they are right in pointing out that people are stupid for paying 1k for a concert. Supply and Demand is a key factor here, and when idiots are willing to spend that amount of money for a night it really isn't anyone's fault but the consumer.",

            "The issue that makes them both correct is the fact that Ticketmaster and the insider scalpers are putting their fingers on the scale of supply and demand. Before TM, 20k seats would go for sale all at once. Some would sit for a bit, but the face value would hold until it was a true sellout. Then the scalpers would come in and start selling their tickets for a markup. What Ticketmaster did and the DoJ is alleging is that they would only truly sell like 10k tickets or less for that same venue and let the scalpers buy up the rest. Then they slow drip those tickets on the secondary market, making it seem like there\u2019s way more demand than there is, and collecting fees at every transaction",

I\u2019m not a Ticketmaster apologist \u2014 they have some obvious and egregious practices, particularly around fees, and their sometimes wonky tech stack.

            "I won\u2019t argue your points other than to say others tried to claim the artist has no say. They do. And some do choose to opt out because they too think it\u2019s bullshit. That\u2019s all. Fans solely blaming Ticketmaster are misguided. Rodrigo (or at least her team) deserve some of the vitriol.",

            "Well, they aren\u2019t *wrong*. Frustrating that this happens and stupid to think people spend $1k+ for average tickets to a show, sure. But it is a fact that if the shows are indeed packed, there is enough demand in the market to sell all the tickets at their asking prices. Not to sound like a prick, but that is simple economics. \n\nShould online platforms regulate bot purchasing better? Sure, give normal people a chance to buy the tickets rather than downstream businesses that snatch them up and peddle them at higher prices.",

So if you are going to go with dynamic pricing, let\u2019s say those doing a swifty concert will get a massive bonus. I imagine that money doesn\u2019t go to them now, but if I was any pop artist that\u2019s where I would put my goodwil.

It can mean spending very long periods of time away from family and friends and being surrounded by people who don't have your best interests at heart and will push you way beyond your normal limits, whether it's manipulative corporate yes men, or just other musicians and crew who use peer pressure to normalise outrageous behaviour.\n\nLet's face it, many musicians don't start out perfectly stable and healthy!\n\nMany come have had bad experiences in childhood, tough family lives, and they may be struggling with depression or other mental health issues, and they take all of that and feed it into their music.\n\nAnd we, as listeners, we can hear it, and we relate to it, and it just makes their music even more powerful for us!\n\nBut the downside to all of that is that they often self-medicate.\n\nAnd all too often, the balance of the scales tips too far over, and it overwhelms them, and they are lost to us.\n\nChris Cornell's death was the one that shocked me the most, to be honest. \n\nA few years older than me, I thought he'd made it through the worst years, and he was doing OK.\n\nHe was only seeming to get better as a singer and, frankly, even hotter, as he aged.

I think what the OC is saying is that his death will forever be connected to the lifestyle he lived up to his death.\n\nHell, you can\u2019t watch an Elvis documentary without them talking about how his Memphis Mafia would get him like 12 burgers a day towards the end of his life. He\u2019ll always be The King, but he\u2019ll also always be known for those last few years of his life.",

I was trying to draw a parallel for the sake of conversation about \u201ctarnishing.\u201d I imagine being on a bunch of drugs would be more tarnishing for Elvis\u2019 legacy vs Weiland\u2019s because of society\u2019s view on drugs in those two very different times.",

Death is \"usually rarely\" glamorous, indicating that on a rare occasion, death may be glamorous. Which we know, given context.

But it wasn\u2019t the first time I considered driving while drinking, and a Reddit comment sure as fuck wouldn\u2019t have made me change my mind. Some people need to cut it out entirely. Most people need reminding and a friend in that situation is better than going sober forever. A friend didn\u2019t stop me that night. I convinced them I was ok. I wasn\u2019t. But someone else making a mistake of trying to drive while intoxicated isn\u2019t a permanent show of their character. Repeatedly choosing booze over working through problems. Hiding the amount of drinking from people in your life so they don\u2019t see it as a problem. Being flippant about your own safety due to your disdain for your situation. That\u2019s a problem.
