            "[Nobody knows where they might end up...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksasuf2qals)\n\nOne of the lessons  in my journey of drifting from one IRL community to another and having them all differ greatly, is that nobody can perceive a quality that they don't already possess or were modeled for them by a parental figure. \n\nFor example, I had a friend who trusted everyone because he would never lie. So he assumed everyone to be like him. \n\nAlso, imagine a shoplifter. They got away with stealing, but they would get paranoid as they marched to their car as they imagine everyone is suspicious of them, when in fact, the mall workers are tired and preoccupied with the idea of clocking out. \n\nPicasso once said that art is the lie that reveals the truth; whatever we imagined is unique to the artist, but the viewer or the reader can only extract meanings relevant only to the context and experiences they already have. \n\nThis is why the purpose of an artist or a writer is actually to ask questions, not answer them, even if the work or literature is posed as a statement.\n\nBtw, this concept is called projective identification. People can only perceive others as deep as they can perceive themselves, so if they have difficult emotions that they want to avoid, like feeling shame from being chronically online and not achieving much in life, they may accuse others of doing so in order to avoid looking inward. It's easier to feel angry and attack someone who's doing the same crime you do than reform yourself internally, and you might as well compulsively engage with this person by provoking them to further reinforce the dyadic relationship.",

            "I've seen shampoo refills at Watson. Gf buys them all the time.",
            "I travel a lot and I bought it. Here's some things you should take note of:\n\n* You can only book 14 days in advance to be eligible for zero fare flights.\n* You can only book zero fare flights on specific days that are low peak travel. This usually means unpopular days like Tuesdays or Thursdays.\n* You won't know which days are eligible for zero fare until you are searching for it and they will lead you to a page with a list of dates you can purchase. Unfortunately the page is not available until you have paid for the pass and are actively searching for the route.\n* Free airport ride is only applicable for prebook rides that cost more than RM90.\n* You cannot use it if you skip 3 flights that you purchase via the explorer pass.\n\nHere's why I regret purchasing it:\n\n* As an impulse frequent traveller, I usually book last minute (less than 14 days) flights.\n* Rescheduling flights cost means they will charge you full rate even though the dates are applicable for zero fare. Oh and this counts as you skipping your flight bought on explorer pass.\n* In 1 month, usually there are only 3-5 dates available for zero fare. None of the timing and dates fit my schedule which are usually Thursdays. You need to follow AirAsia's schedule basically.\n* I live the other side of KL from KLIA2\\* yet my airport ride costs RM55-60 on the app. Who's trip costs RM90? Are they going straight to Genting?\n* When I pre-book, 100% of the time, drivers call me to say they cannot accept my time and ask me to reschedule my ride. When I say no (because I have a fucking flight to catch), they cancel. By that time, I am no longer eligible for pre-booking because it's too late to pre-book.\n* Since I purchased the Explorer Pass in April\\* I have only flown a flight under explorer pass once, and rescheduled the other one (which means I have \"skipped\" it). For reference, since April I have flown more than 15 international flights.\n\nTLDR: Overall, not worth it for me.",
            "1. See if signboard has JKR or PBT logo on it first, but its usually a PBT one in housing estates.\n\n2. Trees that are not fruit or food plants tend to be considered PBT property too. \n\nComplaints system depend on PBT.

            "A lot of products can do that but you need to understand your hair type first so try to experiment with different products. Thicker hair type may require stronger hold, but if you have thinner hair type, using a looser hold is just enough so it doesn't weigh your hair down and it looks more natural.\n\n  \nFrom loose hold to strong hold: hair oils, hair clay, hair wax, mousse, pomade, gel, hair spray. Note that stronger hold products can make your curls more prominent depending on the technique you use, which you can use to your advantage if you like your curls. All products you can get at any watsons, guardian and the like. Follow the instructions on the label on how to use.",

For you must always remember and hold fast to this, that the door is open\" \n\n\u2014 Epictetus.\n\nThis is to say that you can take your own life at any time. If the situation requires it, then do it. But if it's not the most urgent thing, you can live another day and see how much worse it can get. You can always kill yourself after that exam, or after you declare bankruptcy, or after you really are old and completely alone. \n\nThere is also:\n\n\u201cIt is not worth the bother of killing yourself, since you always kill yourself too late.\u201d\n\n\u2015 Emil Cioran, The Trouble With Being Born.\n\n**Someone being an asshole is not one of the conditions to consider euthanasia.

            "Hi guys, feel free to ask me anything about Enterpreneurship. add my name lah OP. These are the things that what I have done and are still currently doing for 20+ years:\n\nmusic - first and longest drumline group, most show performed by a music band in msia, teacher  \nmedia - tv and film producer, director, (ex) actor, etc.  \ntech - storage specialist, AI, iot, automation  \nmining - one and only company with a processing factory in msia  \nbus - first (and only?) local branded aircond manufacturer in msia last time (for intrakota, proton waja, etc)\n\n  \nthere are a few more, but just tag my name and I'll probably have an experience in that field- eg. valve, petrochemical complex, taxi/bus, water telemetry). Some of the FAQs that I got over the years:\n\nSo you suck at SPM. game over right?  \nHeck no! a kampung guy in (almost) all sense of life metric a loser, is one of the very, very few expert metallurgist IN ASIA in kuantan - the kind of guy who can tell you the % of Carbon in coal just by looking and feeling.\n\nSo you're nowhere near big cities. game over right?  \na friend who flopped hard on spm, turned his life around by following the tvet road, is now a contract worker doing welding and diving every few months earning 6 digits in a few weeks of work. \n\nHow important are academics to be successful in life?  \nNot related to be honest. Being good academically, or being good in working life, both don't need to be related. Not all successes are measure-worthy, this is the key takeaway point. My grandmother only was in school for a few years, have rm20+ in the bank, but raised 14 kids on her own, and have 6 figure assets in terms of gold and diamond luxury accessories around her body for trading (now), keeps the gold and cash in her room and her bra. doesn't care about politics, doesn't care about causes, doesn't care (too much) about the environment, just care about upbringing. since only us and her buyers know about the gold bangles and necklaces and shit, in all metrics she is a failure in life.\n\nSo what good is SPM then?  \nmy own opinion after 40+ years of living, is that SPM is really good to instill good behaviour, long-term and CONSISTENT learning - consistently doing something over and over and over again to reach a long-term goal that's only measurable in the form of time (makin lama makin near the goal). that's the only metric that you need to evaluate yourself, not the grade. this is the most important life skill that you can have. so if you fail this, now what? you have lots of chances after - college, uni, work, etc. it's not the end of the world.",

            "Can't tell you whether YTP Mara is good or bad. But if you want to know what's Pinjaman Boleh Ubah, I believe it's a form of loan payment reduction. This is a rather unique form of loan repayment whereby the amount of loan that you have to repay depends on your CGPA (or academic performance). The better your academic performance, the smaller the amount you have to pay back. The reason why it's not a scholarship is because, well, you still have to pay back some amount of money that you have loaned. Excerpt:\n\n**Apakah yang dimaksudkan dengan Pinjaman Boleh Ubah?**\n\nPinjaman Boleh Ubah (PBU) bermaksud keseluruhan pinjaman pelajaran yang diterima boleh dipertimbangkan pengurangan bayaran balik berdasarkan prestasi akademik pelajar setelah tamat pengajian, tertakluk kepada dasar yang ditetapkan.\n\nKadar Pengurangan Pinjaman MARA berdasarkan CGPA\\*\n\n\u25fe3.5 - 4.0\u00a0\u00a0 - Bayaran balik 15% dari jumlah pinjaman\n\n\u25fe3.0 - 3.49 - Bayaran balik 20% dari jumlah pinjaman\n\n\u25fe2.5 - 2.99 - Bayaran balik 25% dari jumlah pinjaman\n\n\u25fe2.0 - 2.49 - Bayaran balik 30% dari jumlah pinjaman\n\n\\*Tertakluk kepada perubahan\n\n  \nSee: [https://www.uniassist.my/post/biasiswa2024#viewer-dt3gw62](https://www.uniassist.my/post/biasiswa2024#viewer-dt3gw62)\n\nYou can outright ask the officer from MARA what the latest rates are, and how the scheme works. Just email them or call them.",
            "Yup it's a pinjaman boleh ubah but the repayment is in installment and there is no interest on the principal amount so I believe that it is worth it on itself and I'm sure the repayment could be negotiated for it to be manageable for you.\n\nAs for the experience overseas, it is also worth it. It may changed your perspective towards different parts of life and you can experience things you may not be able to in Malaysia. Down the line when you felt like living overseas is not for you, you can always come back home.",
            "Thanks! Any specific branch?",
            "Remember that there're only 10% of the matrikulasi seats made available to non-bumis. I hope you have a backup plan, and start thinking of alternatives if you didn't manage to get in the first time. It's rather unlikely that your rayuan will succeed, because you're banking on any of the 10% of non-bumis who got in dropping out to give you a \"seat\" (knowing how difficult it is to get into the program for non-bumis, and how easy it is to secure a seat in local university in your program of choice after finishing the course, it is highly unlikely for anyone to drop out).\n\nI don't think there's any reason why you should feel discouraged. Academic achievement is only one of the criteria that matrikulasi looks at for admission, but they also place more emphasis for folks who come from the suburban rural areas, families with poorer background etc. The system is rigged against you, and there's nothing you should feel ashamed or discouraged about.",
            "Am happy to help share some information on studying psychology, feel free to ask if you're having any questions on this.\n\nI do however wish to ask, are you familiar with all the different post-SPM options i.e. STPM, A level, foundation etc.?",
            "There are only 4 paths to get into local public universities if you insist on getting into one. I'm going to call a spade a spade and list the 4 of them from the easiest (in terms of course material) to the hardest. Options:\n\n1. Asasi (foundation), but this route admits almost 100% bumi only. Almost guaranteed to get a spot in public universities (unless you majorly screwed up). \n\n2. Matrikulasi (matriculation), but this route admits almost 90% bumi only. If you're non-bumi and you manage to secure a spot within the 10% of seats in matrikulasi, please take it. You're almost guaranteed a spot to get into local university. Course material is also relatively easy. \n\n3. Politeknik (polytechnique), if you're non-bumi, this is honestly your most realistic shot to get into local university. Course material is also relatively easy. However the odds of you getting into local university is not as high as Matrikulasi or Asasi.\n\n4. STPM (formerly known as HSC), if you're non-bumi, this is an alternative to politeknik. I took STPM, so I can tell you right away, it contains the hardest course material out of all of the alternatives presented to you. At least back in my day, it's harder than Cambridge/Edexcel A-levels, Australian matriculation, IB, Canadian Pre-U etc. Without accounting for the Chinese Gaokao (which is on another difficulty level), STPM is probably on a similar level of difficulty to IIT JEE (India) and Singapore A-levels internationally. The only other pre-university path that has similar difficulty level to STPM in Malaysia is the UEC (Chinese independent exam). Because of the difficulty of STPM, I generally advise against taking it, unless you're absolutely sure you are going to work hard. Otherwise you will suffer. Also, there's no guarantee that you'll get into public university even if you get good grades (unlike Asasi or Matrikulasi). \n\nNow, if you're interested in psychology and public university locally, your best bet is politeknik. I honestly wouldn't even consider STPM an option based on your SPM grades, unless you work really hard. Another option is to go the route of private local university if you're open to it. You'll need to pay, but there's always PTPTN loans.",
            "Have u considered stpm?",
            "First consider what your main interest is.\n\nThen, find out all the possible routes to that interest and quantify the cost for each route. Shortest route is normally the most expensive one.\n\nFinally, find out what's the best possible route that you can afford.",
            "i suggest you to retake maths, because that E is not even credit which most universities requires their students to at least have.",
            "Go to Politeknik. You will only need 3 credits (including Maths) to get in. Fee is RM200 per semester. Hostel is RM2/day.\n\nStudy for 3 years. While there, consider what track you want to specialize in. Tracks may include software engineering, networking, infosec etc.\n\nDo well in it, and use your diploma to enter uni. Will take you longer, but who cares as long you get there in the end.",
            "30 days from the closing date (26th June)",
            "Someone DM'ed me and asked me a similar question. For the benefit of all the other students who want to ask a question like this, there's no such thing as which choice is \"better\". Better in terms of what? There are so many angles that you have to look at in order to say which is \"better\".\n\n  \nRather than asking which one is better I urge all the SPM leavers to think about 3 things when picking a course/career path:\n\n1. Think about what interests you. The last thing you wanna be doing is studying a course that you are not interested in. No matter how good of a student you are, spending 3-4 years studying something you dislike will burn you out.\n\n2. Think about what career do you want to pursue, and if there are prospects. This requires you to look at current market trends, and project out to the future when you graduate. Do you want to go into the industry/market? Do you want to be in academia? What kind of work do you want to be doing?\n\n3. If the career you really want to pursue doesn't have prospects in Malaysia, are you willing to move to anywhere else on earth in order to work in the said field?\n\n  \nLook, do I have friends who picked a course in university/college, but ended up doing something completely different upon graduation? Sure, I have seen many. But is this the ideal way of picking a course/path to tread on, probably not. Everyone is adaptable, but if given a choice, I would say that ideally any individual would want to try to pick a course/career path that would match their interests. Then, you let market forces determine whether you switch careers later.",
            "If u want to go for vet med after matrikulasi u can aim for upm or umk in upu. \n\nWarning tho cause veterinary is a highly competitive course since it's very limited in this country. So u will have to grind hard to even get an iv. Also, make sure u get into sains hayat module (preferably) but i think sains computer module is also able to pursue veterinary but try to check again the requirements",
            "Ask the relevant authorities in the school you want to retake. They would give more useful, specific advice compared to the general advice we can give. But in theory, even if you had full A in every subject you should be able to retake. Grades should not be the problem here.",
            "I can't speak to how the market/industry is in Malaysia. I can tell you in general there are a couple of different paths to get into data science, but most data science positions in companies that I know of usually will require an advanced degree (Masters or PhD), or otherwise will require many years of work experience.\n\nI'm going to give you a run down of different paths to getting into ML related positions/work in general:\n\n1. Computer science degree with a focus in AI/ML. This is probably the common path.\n2. Data science degree. I'm starting to see some universities offering undergraduate data science degrees. Not sure how the market will be like when these folks graduate, but I still think that most companies will hire those with advance degrees only for ML positions. Most data science degrees today are at least Masters level and above.\n3. Applied Math/Statistics degree. Since ML is heavily steeped in statistics, usually folks in stats are extremely well suited to do data science.\n4. Engineering. There are 3 engineering disciplines that tend to come into contact with ML. Industrial Engineering/Financial Engineering/Operations Research is one of them, since they are heavily steeped in quantitative analysis. Biomedical engineering, specifically those who work on bio informatics since it has the most usage of statistics. Finally Electrical Engineering, specifically those who work on Signals and Systems (telecommunication, robotics, computer vision etc. fall under this category), since this is the discipline that uses the most amount of statistics.\n5. Physics/Chemistry/Biology science degree . You may think this is surprising, But usually if you're in one of these 3 sciences and you are working on modelling molecular/atomic or quantum behavior (eg protein folding, drug synthesis etc.), you're very likely to have some knowledge of ML algorithms due to the nature of your work.\n\nHonestly it really depends on what kind of data science job are you into. You can DM me if you want more information about how I use AI/ML in general in my work.",
            "unless you want to go into oil and gas, it isn't really worth it",
            "On top of what another reply said, there are two fields that comes to my mind which need geophysics. One of them is oil and gas (most lucrative), the other one is mining. This is from a private sector side of things. If you want to be in academia then the answer is different, since people go into different fields in academia for purposes beyond monetary gains, and most of them end up in their fields because of passion or an interest to serve a greater purpose.  \n\nThis is more personal, but my advice to students who are interested in fields that are in the niche areas, is to look beyond the boundaries of Malaysia. Unless you have a strong fear of being mobile, you should not restrict yourself to opportunities in Malaysia especially if you're really interested in a particular field. But this is really up to personal choice and preference.",

But if you want to get into the more algorithmic side of things then that would usually require advanced degrees or many years of experience. This is because in order for you to derive meaning out of data, you need insight and experience, which can only come with time.",
            "Okk thank you so much ^^",
            "I see, but when I mention data science, i was more of referring to the finding & communicating results/data part of the job, not sure if it is algorithmic per se.",
            "Finding data usually falls into the area of subject matter experts. If you're talking about marketing data, or business data (like surveys etc.), that would fall under software engineering for data collection and maintaining a database of user feedback. If you're talking about other kinds of ML like obtaining data from simulation of protein folding, satellite data for weather forecasting, or other kinds of data like device (IOT or edge hardware) performance data, these usually require some level of subject matter expertise. There's a reason why being a subject matter expert + having knowledge of ML techniques is a combination of skillset that's heavily sought after in the market. \n\n  \nCommunicating results usually isn't a separate role. The researcher who's involved with designing algorithms to sort and analyze the data usually presents the results/insights. Ask yourself, if I did all the work to design a methodology or visualization of the data to obtain a conclusion or insight, why would I need someone else to present the said results? Wouldn't the person who was involved in the analysis be the best person to communicate the results?"
