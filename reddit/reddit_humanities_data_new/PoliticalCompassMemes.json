If those stories were properly contextualized and had their sources and authors explicitly referenced, it would do a lot to reveal the kind of misinformation that neo-Nazis and other apologist movements today surround themselves in, and understanding this improves our ability to correct and counter false narratives. \n\nUltimately, the real solution to anti-intellectualism is revealing the biases in all perspectives and making readers able to trace every account of events to their sources, therefore making a decision on whether they should trust that information.

A very large amount (I'd estimate around 20-50%) of Wikipedia's admins are Marxists, and make no attempt to hide their ideological bias. There also aren't many of them (for political topics, probably less than 100 admins are frequently active), so most of them know each other and will never hold each other accountable for bad-faith behaviour.\n\nIf you confront them about this ideological bias, their usual response is ''reality has a left-wing bias.'' But this doesn't explain everything - admins choose which sources Wikipedia considers reliable, and they choose to disregard any right-leaning source, while allowing leftist tabloids like The Daily Beast and Buzzfeed to be used as sources in articles.\n\nThe final thing, which is arguably the worst, is that they will launch harassment campaign against you, if they feel threatened by you. They spend almost all day on Wikipedia, and have the time to do this, and know that you probably have others things to do in life and will either get exhausted and leave, or will commit an extremely minor infraction by mistake, allowing them to permanently suspend your account.\n\nI once made a small edit to the page on the Provisional IRA, that an admin did not like, and he proceeded to then follow me around Wikipedia. Almost every time I made an edit, no matter which subject (whether it be physics, history, military warfare etc.) he would revert the edit, claiming my edit went against a Wikipedia rule or that I had made a type (but then proceeded to delete an entire paragraph of text). This was what made Wikipedia tiring and caused me to stop editing.\n\nThere were multiple harassment campaigns I encountered, but this one was the worst since he actually reported me for ''not being here to build an encyclopedia'' to the admins, and had his friends write statements in his support. He failed to actually provide a single example of a rule I had broken, and instead simply sent links to various edits I had made and described what I had done (ex: there was an article where I had changed the caption under an image, and he sent it to the admins and labelled it 'changed sentence under image.'). In spite of this, the admin overseeing the case almost immediately agreed with him, ignored the entirety of the statement I had written in my defence, and gave me a temporary block from Wikipedia.",

If they don't 100% support allowing trans women to compete with cis women entirely because they're concerned with how fair it would be, people accuse them of being bootlickers/self hating/etc (and this isn't the only topic that has resulted in that for them). \n\nIt feels like most discussions about the topic are incredibly extreme and black and white.
