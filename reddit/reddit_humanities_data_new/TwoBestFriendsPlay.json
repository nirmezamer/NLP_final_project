They literally made the little bastard Griffith. I wanted to see Miquella end up being on of those people that has powers incompatible with their goals for a better world. Or that using his powers to make things better in the Lands Between had drastic consequences that made other parts of the world worse. Maybe even have him be one of those \"I've done too much to deviate from my current path\" kinda anti-villains. Hell, even delving into how too much pragmatism in wanting to achieve your goals is sometimes the wrong thing to do. Not that he was just some fuckin' yandere that went too far.!< \n\n>!Then there's that whole thing with the Mother of Fingers and the Greater Will being not involved at all that really fucks with poor Goldmask's ending.

Him fixing the broken code of the GO to be more fair is all for nothing because the whole *concept* is meaningless.!<\n\nRather a bit of a wet fart for me, while also messing with several other characters' motivations in a rather disappointing way.\n\nGotta admit though, this new context makes a quote I saw on reddit during the leaks *funny as fuck*: >!\"Looks like Mohg **is** beating those allegations!\"!<",

Some of the normal enemies have a higher damage scaling, but that's about it. Some of the secret bosses tho, YO. Idk if i'm winning those fights lmao.

            "Leaving this comment since I likely won\u2019t be able to start it until Saturday or Sunday, but can anyone confirm if there are snakes in the dlc? I have a phobia and FROM loves put them in their games. I know one of the main guys has a snake motif but I don\u2019t know to the what extent (like if its just more or less part of his outfit or if it can attack). I hate that I have to check this stuff before playing but it\u2019s genuinely difficult for me to do content involving them without freezing up.\u00a0",

            "I spent an hour about on what I was sure was a jumping puzzle at one of the churches. It wasn't. Still fuckin got up there, though. Should have left a message to screw with the next person who thought the same as me.\n\nAlso, it is really sorta jarring coming to this game from DS3. In that game, the Manual Attack Aim option works properly, which lets you angle the attacks of certain larger weapon classes while locked onto an enemy. You have to stop holding inputs whenever you perform an attack, to prevent any unintentional angling of it, but as a consequence you're able to much better respond to people trying to run around you. If you want to remotely have a chance in PvP with ultras, and just make them feel a lot better in general, you want to be using this option.\n\nIn this game, it's in the options menu but does literally shit all. Like I think I remember asking someone & apparently it's on a tiny handful of attacks. So I've been finding myself locking on & then using attacks that I keep thinking will hit if I input the right direction. Except since I locked on, the game's not gonna let me influence the direction of the attack. So there's been a lot of unlocked camera gaming going down, since you can still properly input directions when unlocked. Which really makes me think this has to be a bug that they somehow haven't noticed, despite people reporting it.",
            "So anyone whose played far enough to know, whats the NPC quest situation like? Are they straight forward or are there some Milicent situations/obtuseness to deal with?\n\nI only just entered the DLC and beelined the Gaol Knight for his sick ass drip(beat him first try by almost literally the skin of my teeth, this DLC FUCKS).",
            "I haven't really found a good place to ask this without being exposed to spoilers, I just have one question: Did they change how powerstancing maces and axes work? Those tend to be the worst power stance moveset cause of how slow the start of the chain is. I knew about the Torrent change to the final boss fight in base game so I thought maybe they adjusted that as well too.",
            "Currently badly lost in the DLC, have successfully defeated two major bosses but still can't handle the fucking Blackgaol Knight. Game's great.\n\nOne thing I dislike: I'm at rune level 166-170, all of the bosses only give half enough runes for a level, so I find myself 'porting over to the Albinauric cliff every time to farm the remainder. It's screwing up the flow. Yes it's my own fault but I'm not about to lose that many runes.\n\nOne thing I really love: no DLC trophies equals no pressure to 100%. I can play and explore the world the way I like. It's a nice change of pace for PS5.",

The first one had me battling the camera more than the boss, and this second one has zero openings and does half my HP (with +5 Scardutree buff thing, that shit makes barely any difference) per hit in its infinite combos.\n\nDark Souls 3 remains the peak of FromSoft\u2019s dodge-based combat games, bosses and all.",

            "There is a thought that has been bubbling in my gut since last year and I must expel it:\n\nGame of Thrones, its terrible ending and the discourse surrounding it has poisoned the Dark Fantasy genre and the perception of it.\n\nDespite, say, Final Fantasy XVI doing what GOT *should have done*, >!it is said to have abandoned the \"GOT vibes\". This is in spite of how the thing with the Blight (Winter) and the Akashic (White Walkers) become among the main threats after the political nonsense falls apart because the people in charge were irresponsible and short sighted *just like the GOT people*. But no. Cersei and Dany facing off is the final boss fight. Not the Night King. Not the existential threat that is an allegory for the climate crisis. Something GRRM wrote to be something everyone needed to put aside to fight.!<\n\nalso, despite the marketing, XVI is more Berserk than GOT.\n\nBut it. It angers me. >!Partly because people spoke about how XVI \"abandons its politics\" (but it doesn't really) and how I consider that a big spoiler to even discuss vaguely that people happily talked about, but how XVI clearly looked at GOT and thought \"Well, this is how it's gonna go, surely.\" Like, XVI is only good because it's about petty nobles arguing and warring when they're ignoring the real problems and I'm just going in circles here cause I'm ranting. Only thing that it doesn't really do is that the final boss fight is just Clive vs Ultima, but even then, symbolically, his friends are helping him, and doing the side quests you see people do come together. Put aside their differences to fight bigger problems. Make new allegiances. Hope for a future now that the political war mongers are vanquished. Because the game makes it clear defeating the Big Bad Ultima won't save the world. Just give it a chance. Like if killing the Night King didn't stop Winter, just stopped the White Walkers. Even if it was Jon Snow or Arya or whomever dealing the final blow, that the real battle would be people fighting the winter, struggling together to survive.!<\n\nI mourn for the next Dark Fantasy that tries to do a good version of Game of Thrones.",

Margit requires not panic rolling, strafing/re-poisitoning to bait out certain attacks, avoid certain attacks, or be in the right place to pull off a charged attacks,  and maintaining aggression to prevent his stance from recovering so you can break it and get a crit off.\n\n\n\n\nTree Sentinel has the same philosophy, but also the importance of jumping as in his second phase, he has a jumping shield bash that slams on the ground in an AOE that's easier to avoid by jumping instead of rolling.",

It made it stand out more when you fought someone like Artorias who'd throw in a couple of somersaults. \n\nIn Elden Ring, even the early bosses can have anime-style moves where they do three flips, hang in the air for a second and then launch themselves at you. It would be more fun if we could knock them out of these elaborate combos, since they have no trouble doing the same to us.",

There's some spells that they won't auto-dodge so you can rack up ranged damage, there's some where you can just get a terrain advantage and cheese them from above, there's some where their AI tends to leave pretty specific openings if you're ready for them (heavy weapon swings timed right when they try for a jump attack often sends them flying), and worst comes to worst there's probably a few Ashes of War that you can shove on almost any weapon and break them with.\n\nOr even Spirit Ashes, if you want, quite a few NPC enemies are in areas where you can summon, and that AI goes straight to the gutter against two opponents because they're busy aimbot dodging one and not the other.  Don't force yourself to be limited to \"No Summons Gotta Solo\" if you're genuinely not having fun, just slap down a Tiche or Mimic Tear or something and go to town.\n\nYou're not wrong that they can totally suck ass though, reminds me of DS2 invaders where they waltz in with 5 times the HP cap and rip off huge chunks of your health bar per hit.",

            "Thursday, the 20th was my dad's birthday! And Sunday the 23rd will be mine. As usual I don't exactly look forward to the vague passage of time, but I can't really deny it's approach all the same. I am wondering if I should get something really dumb and expensive, though. Like, I saw an airsoft lever-action rifle that you put the BB into a cartridge and it'll cycle through and spit them out like a real thing. I don't need it, but... C'mon.\n\nReally, our family's not been much of birthday celebratin' people beyond getting a nice dinner. So instead of a present, I'd love it more if you checked out my novel [The Demon in Shadow.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FmMdrhiW56K291gS1V3EdQ8Oe5SIVM0dgbtbpbCTTRs/edit?usp=sharing) you can even use this [PDF link and read it on the go.](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fw8brtve5pdezq9vl8lmp/TheDemonInShadowBWInserts.pdf?rlkey=qpz48504fh6u7jweomm1modez&e=1&st=7c5shz6h&dl=0) I did that last week when I was travelling for work! And really other than some bad syntax and formatting mistakes I don't hate it. This story is about humans and demons, the latter who are relatively recent additions to the world of Milesain. Human Max and Demon Ayun cross paths and find themselves linked together in a larger journey that will confront their pasts and possibly topple a larger threat to demonkind. There's amazing artwork tucked away in certain spots of the chapters as well as in the back for character profiles and other shenanigans. Actually, speaking of shenanigans [I made my own dumb little four-panel comic](https://i.imgur.com/5ZnY9vW.png) with Ayun, Max and his sister Monika. The joke probably lands better when you read the book. Please!\n\nAnd if you can't get enough of those two or the world, then consider this preview of the sequel, [The Demons of Blood & Bone.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12EY1Olrc8eOw8y6eCTxvuYpb-w1L-ckcDhRkQEZaYSk/edit?usp=sharing) While Max and Ayun continue growing closer, they face a new group of demons that are linked to a mysteriously wicked weapon. It's also got some art, right now just characters, in the back.\n\nI'm glad that I had this guy already shot before I took a trip because I've been barely alive all week thanks to post-trade show mess. It's the [Gyan Revive!](https://imgur.com/a/Y1xkY6n) An interesting kit because despite it being from 2016, was just a few kits shy of dual language. Not that it matters greatly, because this kit transcends language. It's a good suit. Though I'll say maybe it's the rounded shoulders or the coloring, but this feels like a buff suit. I just kept wanting to pose it in Armstrong-esque poses. Gachimuchi aside, there's not much going on though to be fair there wasn't much going on for the Gyan. It's got a saber, it's got a shield that shoots stuff. Not even a gun or a way to cheese a Zaku's rifle in there. They did add a hand with a special wrist to make more stabby motions. Could've used that on the Rune Gods. I still think it's great, and I think it was a tidy 20 bucks or something at my local shop. And it's always good to have more Zeon kits.\n\nHajime No Ippo is on Netflix. I've read it, but I've never actually watched the series proper. And it starts out strong. The animation is really good, although I can see the shortcuts like watching Miyata duck and weave four times or so. There's also an English dub and... It's not too bad. Steve Staley is Ippo (for you Gundam nerds, Banagher from Unicorn and Shiro of 08th) and he does good work at being meek and serious. Everybody else is just fine, nothing standout but also nothing truly vile. They don't give you English CC so the subtitles are translated and the major deviation seems to be tied to lip lock. And maybe it feels like they're trying to tone it down? They swear some in the subtitles but I'm not heard as much as a damn in English. Maybe it was an attempt to get it to air for something like Toonami. Which probably is immediately countered by the dick jokes.",

I've done a lot this week in terms of actionable things -- making great progress on my novel, for instance -- but not a lot in terms of variety, so this one's gonna be a short one.\n\nFirst off, [I finished streaming](https://www.twitch.tv/kkterthelt) **Crow Country** (and you can see the whole stream series [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRPzT1i2o8S4BKj8EPvDKNO9q_G3C-uQi))! Fucking *immaculate* little game. If not for *Signalis* being maybe my favorite game of all time, this would be my favorite survival horror game in years -- and I would say it even does a few things better than *Signalis*, like raw scare factor. It's a compact experience that does exactly what it needs to do, and tells a story that kept me guessing the entire way and paid off like a lightning strike to my brain by the end. >!I had vague inklings in my brain that the Pool might be a portal to somewhere, but the misdirections about the Roots and the gold scam were so effective that I never even scratched at the core truth. It's such a refreshing twist for a horror game, and such a horrifying series of actions from Edward Crow, no matter how contrite he is about it all in the present. And even though I figured out Mara's identity very early, I was still gobsmacked by the health meter reveal and everything that came with it, which they managed to spin into a genuinely emotional and bittersweet hook for the ending even with how nihilistic the big answers were.!<\n\n9/10 game with a 10/10 finish. Some of the puzzles sucked (that mushroom room is truly baffling), but when that's the worst I can level at your game, you knocked it out of the park. Will be keeping an eye on these devs with great interest.\n\nSecond, and the vast majority of the week: my **Elden Ring** prep! I have so many ongoing and new games that I desperately want to get back on, but I couldn't *not* mainline this to clear the impact zone. In the space of the week, I've gotten all the way from Liurnia to the Mountaintops of the Giants, and have gotten a nice reminder of how amazing this game is in the process. I'm torn between leveling up Eleonora's Poleblade to +10 again or continuing with one of my newfound favorites, the Nox Flowing Hammer, which I'm barely specced at all to make great use of but which is so damn fun to smack things around with that I don't care. Once I get through most of Mountaintops and grab the last Bell-Bearings I'm planning on having, I should be good to go for SOTE.\n\nAnd lastly, u/CookieSlut, u/The_Draigg, and I finally finished **Mobile Suit Gundam 00 S2**. Overall, I'd say the first season was a better story, but I enjoyed myself a lot more consistently through this one, even if I was mostly annoyed by the main villain. 00 as a whole struggled to keep my attention consistently the way the UC Gundams did, but the parts that worked were great, and I'm sufficiently hooked for the movie. >!As with the first season, we ended with what looked like a giant cast massacre, only for most of the main characters to be alive with little explanation. At least Tiera's stuck, and I don't have to be annoyed about my favorite character being shot by my least favorite villain because they're a moon computer now. Graham *should* have died last season, because Mr. Bushido was a complete narrative dead end, and he didn't even have the guts to kill himself right so I'll probably be dealing with him in the movie too. And, uh... ALIENS MENTIONED. LET'S GO ALIENS.!<",
            "Somehow managed to get sick again. Could be wildly inaccurate, but it is really starting to feel that June is just a terrible month for me. Hell, I even have the anniversary of my dad's passing coming in a few days.\n\nThat aside, it was interesting seeing the [wide variety of jobs that people on this sub have]1(https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/s/EVUMYYfll8). As for me, apparently, higher education is notorious for taking a while. And that is without it being summertime. \n\nI guess me getting an interview so quickly may have been a supreme stroke of luck, or they tried to push to get at least a few interviews through before people took vacations. What I do know is that the HR department seemed to be a skeleton crew since two of my calls went to voicemail since nobody was around, and another call had the person try to rush me off. \n\nI do customer service, so I had the impression that the person was either swamped or did not have access to anything for one reason or another. Still, they did finally take the listing down from LinkedIn and the site (not that LinkedIn had many applicants in the first place), and my application is still pending. Still praying I get it since I feel I have a decent chance, and I think there are multiple openings.",
            "[Last Week's Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/s/xlySonSoN1)\n\nWeek 16 of hospital. Not much to report in terms of recovery on that front; incremental increases with no major changes. On the other hand, rather excited by a number of reveals from the Nintendo Direct. Also my brother and I started planning for our mother's birthday next month.",
            "[Current Mood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGfyzSM0XSs)\n\nEven on the Northwest coast we're still getting a brief blast of that summer heatwave and *hoo boy* am I feeling it. That and seasonal allergies actually ended with me having to leave work early during one shift due to the heat+pollen combo overwhelming my meds. Guess its back to the masks again *juuuuuuuust* to be safe. At least its payday this week.\n\n**Exalted Essence** made its grand return with what was mainly a very Social session. We ended up escorting our dipshit Dynast kinda-sorta friend back to his wife and then things sorta... *socially escalated* during a sit-down with the two. As it turns out, our God-Blooded/Exigent PC's >!father was also the wife's father, making the two half-siblings and making the PC *way* more involved in Dynastic bullshit than anybody realized!!<, which also sent the wife into Limit Break due to connecting the dots that >!her father probably had been trying to keep her close so she wouldn't accidentally run into her bastard half-sibling!<. Also to cap off the session the Necromancer PC and my PC sent a message to our Lunar friend essentially going \"Hey we got some intel on your Solar friend, *for the love of god do not find us, we will come to you*\" because theres a lot of implication that Solar we (and the >!Infernal!<) are looking for may or may not >!be the Dynast couple's kid!< on top of all the other shit stack on top of that particular task. Shits getting *interesting*.\n\nFinished Season 3 of **Star Trek: Deep Space Nine**! *Holy shit* the back half of this season. After \"Life Support\" I'm all in on the \"*FUCK KAI WINN*\" camp, the B-plot of \"Heart Of Stone\" hit like a fucking truck when >!Nog explained why he wants to join Starfleet!<, the \"Improbable Cause\"/\"The Die Is Cast\" two-parter was basically \"Hey remember The Battle Of Wolf 359? Wanna >!see that happen to the two big antagonist organizations in the show this time?!<\" and *boy oh boy* that Season Finale. \"The Adversary\" was just peak \"oh yeah this is why the Changelings are so fucking dangerous\" wrapped up in a perfect The Thing homage package. Can't wait to continue to see where this all goes.\n\nFinished **LISA The Pointless** with a friend over this week. Not as thorough as I wanted it to be (Didn't get all of Lester's bounties), but for an unmodded non-SOTWS/Infinity Unfolds run, I still think I did pretty good at showing it off. Managed to get the >!high bond \"Joel actually tires shooting the bullet\"!< ending bit at least so I'm satisfied with that. Next up on the docket is **LISA The Hopeful!**. Not sure if I'll do >!all 4 character routes!< for that one, but I'll figure it out once I reach S P O R T S.\n\nSo..... against my better judgement I redownloaded **Borderlands 2**. I have no idea what gripped me to return to Greaseman Randy's Shooty Pit beyond a \"hey there was weird graphics stuff tied to the PC version. Lets see how that looks on the new rig\" and then whoops, I've spent most of the week playing it. Still not really sure how to feel about the franchise nowadays with all the retroactive debate and general.... well, [*gestures at the tire fire that is Gearbox and [Randy Pitchford's reputation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHesnoobl_I) nowadays*]. The game itself is still decently fun and I'll admit theres still some jokes in there I still laugh at. Just a shame that the franchise has been offhand tainted by the assholes within the studio that made it.\n\nMade some more **Assassins Creed 3** progress, by which I mean the >!awkward Father-Son bonding time between Haytham and Connor has come to it's entertaining end!<. Short but definitely an interesting section of the game since >!Connor and Haytham constantly are arguing amongst each other about their organization's philosophies!<. 3 more Sequences (give or take the last few Homestead missions) to go! I'm almost home free!\n\nNew Patch for **Honkai Star Rail** hit and just *really* rubbing it in that I'm not pulling for >!Firefly/Sam!< thanks to last patch's... *horseshoe* luck when it came to the ticket stockpile. I can wait for her rerun in the mean time. Speaking of mean and time (ha), priority right now is Relic/Trace grinding for >!Harmony Trailblazer!< since they just gave us that one free and I've heard they are *super* broken with certain characters like my resident Yee Haw boy (whos also starting to hit viablity once I've leveled his relics a tiny bit more). *I wanna make the numbers funnier*.",
            "**Boops Life:**  Got drunk for the first time and apparently that made me really fun to be around.  Now I've started taking edibles or drinking quite a bit whenever I'm at social gatherings, which probably isn't the healthiest relationship to have.  Maybe I'm just overthinking things, summer tends to bum me out a lot.\n\nAround a month ago, I took up running, but because I hate running when it's warm and because my sister has a +1 membership, I started going to a gym.  I've been going at least 3 times a week, and man, I hate it every time.  I thought I'd feel good eventually about it because people like to tout exercise as a fix all, but it's probably not for me in that sense.\n\nMan, that Direct was pretty good, huh?  Mario and Luigi, MvC, a new Mario Party that'll hopefully be good, Dragon Quest, etc.  Lots of things to be excited for.\n\n**Movies:**  Project Almanac.  I'm a sucker for time travel movies, so I checked this out even though I've heard middling thigs, but yeah, it wasn't very good.  It takes like 40 minutes for any time travel stuff to happen, and while some of it is fun, like going back to win the lottery or acing a quiz, most of it is spent at a concert.  Stuff happens at the end that feels like it was there just to add tension, even if it didn't make much sense.\n\nThe Venture Bros. Movie.  I've been putting this off for a while because it's the last Venture Bros content we'll get and that bums me out, but I finally decided to watch it.  While I thought it was enjoyable, it does very much feel like a season that was edited down to a movie.  There's a lot of things that I wanted to know more about, like the dude that was arching Jonas, but I get they likely didn't have the time they wanted for all of it.  There were characters I wanted to see more of, but again, limited time.\n\n**Games:**  Hi-Fi Rush.  What can I say, it's great and it bums me out we won't get a sequel.  If I had one complaint, it would be the lack of a lock on.  There were quite a few times I ended up grappling an enemy I didn't want to, but it wasn't a huge problem.  I also may have developed a small crush on Korsica.",
            "Well the only big event in my life atm if you can call it that is I won employee of the month at my restaurant job. Apparently all our leadership chefs collectively voted for me cuz these past few weeks have been pretty rough with a lot of changes to the menu and people quitting or getting fired and an entirely new staff that needs training. So between me working a double shift at one point and coming in on my days off and training/supporting new staff pretty much every sous chef ended up getting direct support from me at some point so they all nominated me this month. Our head chef even informed me I'm on her list of getting a raise so that's a plus too.\n\nOther than that I've been watching the latest season of demon slayer. Pretty fun overall. Lots of slow character moments and mainly comedy bits. Mushoku tensei traumatizing you with a very cruel >!episode releasing exactly on Father's day with some traumatic father related content in it!< Like it's been a long time since I've seen an anime episode that legit left me feeling so saddened inside. One of those just turn the TV off and stare at a wall and reflect silently over what just happened moments. Oh and mysterious disappearances is also ok. A little underwhelming if we're being honest tho. I kinda thought the mystery elements would be a bigger focus like anime Scooby Doo investigating mysteries and haunted locations and what not. It's more arc structured so like 2 or 3 episodes revolve around a single supernatural entity. Not bad necessarily but it just makes me wish the show was a little more focused so we could explore more supernatural occurrences.\n\nNothing really new game wise aside from trying to make time with a friend to co op resident evil 5 since she's never played it. She has a huge crush on Chris after playing her first RE game in village so I suggested 5 since it's co op and she can play as him again lol",
            "Well work was fucking tiring today and the month is almost out and still no anti depressants hahaha fuck\u2026 on a bit of a brighter note probably gonna play shadow of the erdtree this weekend so there\u2019s that I guess",
            "This week has been a weird one. I feel like I\u2019ve missed a day. Might be the ramune I\u2019ve been drinking causing this but I dunno. Anyhow!\n\n**Video Games:**\n\nAs such, it has been a weird week for games. I\u2019ve done some **Warframe** and **Monster Hunter: Rise**. I also tried out **Slug Gear**, **Into the Emberlands**, **Angeline Era** and **Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree**.\n\nSo. Warframe has dropped Jade Shadows. A whole quest around the favourite Dread giving Stalker. And uh. >!Guess who is now a father. Yeah. Stalker. It\u2019s a pretty good quest because it\u2019s such a weird one. The idea that Sorren (His actual name) would have a love is neat, but the fact that she is also a Warframe is just interesting. Because it means that he needs the help of the Tenno. Plus the fact the later end of it is just played with Sorren cradling his child is somewhat hilarious. Kicking ass with the Hate whilst keeping his kid safe in the other. And yes. Canonical pregnant warframe. de pls.!<\n\nSo. Whilst I\u2019ve barely done much of Rise, just a single hunt where Fluff, Dizzy and I killed five monsters in rather insane fashion. The major thing is that Fluff has experienced her first interaction with a very special monster. [Khezu](https://i.imgur.com/9ZHuy9I.gif). And lets say that her reactions to it were brilliant. Not helped by [myself](https://i.imgur.com/l5YvH2u.png) going just a little [mad](https://i.imgur.com/KmMJXZX.png) because of it.\n\nIt\u2019s not often that I find a demo just fine. Then the side thing of the dev just showing off stuff being the thing that makes me go \u201cYeah, I\u2019m wishlisting this.\u201d But god damn. I seriously recommend going to play Slug Gear. It\u2019s a pretty basic metroidvania but the combo room? That\u2019s where it showcases its hand.\n\nSo. Into the Emberlands is pretty weird. Because it\u2019s a game about effectively strategising movement and the like. With some minor resource management. But with a cute edge and with rebuilding a town in an almost post-apocalyptic place. It\u2019s weird but neat. I can\u2019t really explain it well but I just find it fun and enjoyable.\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve seen Iron Pineapple\u2019s recent Souls-Like video, you\u2019ve most likely seen this. Which is how I got recommended this and wanted to try it. And is it good? I mean yeah. It\u2019s pretty interesting but a little frustrating on Steam Deck. Mainly because of my sight but one of the main issues, is just readability of some of the stuff.\n\nSo. Shadow of the Erdtree is looking fantastic but uh. So far my time with it has been a weirdly mixed. Some of it my own fault but also just some weird stuff been happening. >!I got stuck on a boss that was in a higher level zone that was effectively accessible in the first zone, has a grab that basically heals them to full using your own health. Plus the damage you deal is like insanely low.!< Plus I also suffered my first blue screen in ages! How? Rolling into some boxes.\n\n**Other Stuff:**\n\nI don\u2019t often read physical manga, mainly as a lot of the stuff I own is stuff I read digitally then purchase after. But when I was out getting my piercings, I managed to get Goodbye, Eri. And well. It\u2019s brilliant. If you haven\u2019t read it, it\u2019s a great read. Trying to really explain it in any sort of my style would spoil a bunch of it. >!But an entire story about recording life and death is interesting and Eri herself is an interesting character. And just... A pinch of fantasy.!<\n\nAnd yeah, I\u2019m now up to 11 piercings now. [Spiderbites](https://i.imgur.com/lXGWGRC.jpg) are currently suffering a bit of swelling but that\u2019s kinda expected.\n\nI\u2019m also suffering a weird thing. Where the fuck do people get casual clothing these days. So, I\u2019ve got like 5 dresses I normally use that are in a more goth/witch sense. But I\u2019m thinking I need more actual like. Casual goth/witch stuff. But I legitimately have no idea where to get them because my usual sites don\u2019t really have the best selection for anything on that nature.\n\nMusic this week is from Shinra-Bansho, [Bye Bye, Rain](https://youtu.be/T5gN7zVSOgY?si=5aSHscTMwmkSdgSM).",

            "Sick of being broke.\n\nAlso sick of not having a job.\n\nBut I know that if I get a job I'll either quit or be fired in a couple months.\n\nah, life.",
            "Not a lot's happened this week. My constant tiredness seems to be mostly over though, so that's nice. Being able to stay awake from morning to evening without feeling like complete shit is definitely an improvement over last week, anyway.\n\nWent through Ace Combat Zero a couple more times, finishing all three paths and unlocking all the planes. I'm gonna need to do a bit more grinding to actually buy them all though.\n\nI finally replayed Devil May Cry 5's story mode. I've played the game a lot in Bloody Palace, and I decided it was time to go back to the story and see if I could get a better rank in some missions, and maybe find a couple of the secret missions I missed. It went surprisingly well, and now I've A-ranked every mission on the normal difficulty and S-ranked about half of them. I might do a run or two on a higher difficulty soon, but I don't feel quite ready for it just yet. There's some bosses I'm still not great at and King Cerberus in particular still gives me a lot of trouble for some reason.\n\nLastly, I've been rewatching the old Dark Souls 2 LP, also known as the adventures of Mild-Mannered Pat and Woolsworth the second, and it's very informative. I'm learning a lot, especially that you should drop your shield. You know what I mean? Seriously, it's crazy how often Pat says it. I remembered it being somewhat common but he doesn't just say it almost every episode, he often says it multiple times in a single episode.",
            "So this week has been mostly awful.\n\nOn Sunday, I came in to find that most of the leftover stuff from last week hadn\u2019t been done because my boss called out on Friday and Saturday. So I tried to get some things out of the way and figured that she would feel better by Monday, but then she called the department during my shift. \n\nShe had a stroke last Thursday and has lost all feeling in one arm and one leg. And yesterday, I learned that she will be out of commission until September, meaning that it\u2019s just me and my incompetent coworker (so it\u2019s mostly just me).\n\nSo I\u2019ve been kinda cursing everyone this week. Cursing myself for getting complacent with this job and not doing anything regarding my capstone for a year and a half, cursing my boss for wanting the lead position when she needs to take a sick day every month due to her poor health, cursing Fred Meyer/Kroger for cutting our hours and potentially preventing us from getting a fourth person so that these types of situations aren\u2019t as stressful, cursing the graduation shoppers who all came on Monday wanting 3-5 fucking bouquets wrapped while I was working the freight all on my own, etc. etc\u2026.\n\nAt the very least, I got to go to my cousin\u2019s high school graduation on Tuesday and see some family I haven\u2019t seen in a while. Got to meet my aunt\u2019s fianc\u00e9, and he suggested I send him my resume and cover letter since he has some connections at Microsoft. So even though I don\u2019t have any personal projects on there, I think I\u2019m just gonna tidy up my resume, write a cover letter, and send them in, because I\u2019m absolutely fucking done with this shitty ass job and I want to start working on my career.",

And it couldn\u2019t have been better timed either, since it\u2019s looking to be like 107 degrees Fahrenheit this weekend. I\u2019d hate to have to have that heat in my house. At least now it should be cooler.\n\nAnyways, for games I\u2019ve played this week, I\u2019ve nearly beaten Warhammer 40k: Boltgun! I\u2019ve just got one level left! So far, the third episode is pretty good and challenging, but I did encounter something that kind of sapped my will to finish it completely this week: I encountered a hard crash bug that I could recreate. Long story short, I completed all the conditions to open the way to grab an ammo refill secret in the middle of a boss fight, but every time I actually touched it, it made the game crash hard to desktop. And while I did play past that level, the amount of time I wasted because of that bug did just bring down my mood enough to make me pretty frustrated with the game as a whole this week. And I figure that if I take another day or two for a breather to clear my head over that annoying bug, I\u2019ll be able to beat it easily. I\u2019ll report in to you all here once it\u2019s finished and beaten!\n\nAlso this week, I\u2019ve started watching The Expanse season 3! Only a few episodes in, but so far, it\u2019s pretty good. >!Farewell Rocinante, and hello Pinus Contorta! Up in the Belt, straight up piloting it. And by it, well, let\u2019s just say my Pinus Contorta!<. Joking aside though, we\u2019ve already got some really good ship on ship action to start out the season, and I\u2019m all for that. Also, man it\u2019s weird that >!Jules-Pierre Mao is somehow the sanest person in the room for 5 minutes, since he said that they should destroy the Hybrids due to the Protomolecule being uncontrollable. A shame that he got convinced otherwise, but I guess Dr. Strickland is just that convincing with his research. I\u2019m feeling that\u2019s a bit of a developing pattern for J.P. now, where he feels utterly horrified at what his company has done, only to the double down on all the evil shit again. Come on buddy, actually stuck with your morals for once already!<. In any case, I\u2019m certainly looking forward to watching more of the season!\n\nAnd finally, in my regular mecha talk season here, /u/Terthelt, /u/CookieSlut, and myself have finished watching all of the Gundam 00 series episodes! Took a while, but both seasons have been completed. Although to be honest, I still prefer season 1 to season 2, if just because it feels more focused and gritty. Not that season 2 is bad, it\u2019s still pretty good, but I liked how the first season was willing to do more different stuff than your traditional Gundam tropes than the second season. That, and I do think the first season handled the characters a bit better. But I will say that the second season has the hyper fight moments and some pretty wild twists in it, so at least it also has some stuff in its favor too. Again not bad, but I feel that it didn\u2019t hit the same peaks as before. Regardless, all we have left to watch now is A Wakening of the Trailblazer to wrap up Gundam 00 completely. The childhood of mankind has ended!",
            "---\n[Last week\u2019s post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1dfhymz/comment/l8jbjv8/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nNothing particular happened, but I\u2019d like to share that I went out to get the \u201c[wolf cut](https://www.tiktok.com/@coolmadsgames/video/6919654706415406341)\u201d hairstyle last week, which I personally consider to look cool and stylish, as well as something that I wanted to have for quite some time now. So, I went to a local hairdresser, discussed a bit and shared pictures, and I received a haircut.\n\nUnfortunately, the result was a different hairstyle. Now to preface this, the hairdresser did a fine job. She\u2019s experienced in her craft and I understand that not everyone knows something popular (hence the \u201csharing pictures\u201d part), with the overall experience being pleasant and enjoyable even. It really helped to alleviate my worries as someone dabbling into the unknown that is trying a new look, besides the occasional trim for my previous, longer hair. There\u2019s always a risk to it, right? The hairstyle that I now have is fine even and some folks can rock it, but it\u2019s just not the one I wanted and it didn\u2019t instill a proud sense of confidence that one may hope for.\n\nI consider myself to have fumbled this. Perhaps I could have showed videos or more pictures. In fact, I also misjudged how short the ends on the back of my hair should be when I was asked about the trimming. Something that I hadn\u2019t fully realized once I went home and spent some time examining everything. Perhaps I experienced a brief \u201choneymoon phase\u201d as I was fairly happy with the result at first, but dang, it was a fairly mild hit to my confidence. During the first three days, a sense of awkwardness crept into my being at times, along with mild disappointment as I looked at the hair length from the back. However, I did find it amusing to be vaguely reminded of Dante from Devil May Cry 3 while looking at the new hair. Not quite the same as we have different-looking bangs, but still, there\u2019s nothing wrong with taking a calculated risk even if it turned out that one is bad at math.\n\nAll that being said, it\u2019s been a curious development of emotions for me since then. I mentioned being happy initially, followed by the mixture of uneasiness and disappointment that loomed over my thoughts, but now? I feel all right with it. My hair is still fairly long and such length can be versatile, and what I did was simply experiment with it. Even style it to look like my previous hairstyle and I found myself liking how it looks. And with shorter hair comes with easier management and combing, which I appreciated.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019m hoping that within the next few months, I can have another attempt at getting a proper wolf cut. Perhaps it\u2019s one of those things that require time to adjust to, but at the very least, I can see my hair reaching the perfect length for [this hairstyle](https://www.tiktok.com/@coolmadsgames/video/7120697193064844550) by then. It\u2019s the same person from the previous link (Coolmadsgames), and I must say, her hair is inspiring to look at.\n\n---\n\n**Sharing Art**\n\nStarting from 49 months [ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/gfmtco/free_talk_friday_may_08_2020/fpv00zb/), I'd like to share drawings of great artists whose works I like or I find inspiring.

            "**Konosuba season 3** ended this week. When a series I like has long gaps between seasons, I find myself thinking \"what was so great about this again?\" Well, in this case I remembered in like the first five minutes of the first episode - it's hilarious in a way few other anime are. I already miss it, hopefully we won't have to wait as long for the next season this time around.\n\nAlso **Hololive** announced a new English generation. 3 days in advance. At this rate the next generation will be revealed the minute the debuts start.",
            "Hey everyone, hope you had a nice week. I played about 13 hours of **Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance** and, surprise, the game that was already good is now even better. I really like the new story and character moments they've put into the new route, and almost all the gameplay changes just make the game feel even better to mess around with. The only gameplay change I'm kinda iffy on is getting rid of the map distortion the abscesses emitted. They designed the original areas around you getting rid of them so you could clear up your map, so they feel pretty hollow now. And I guess *maybe* the reduced level scaling made things a bit too easy on normal mode, but I'll have to finish the game to say for sure. \n\n  \nI also finally started up the Kyokutei Bakin event on **Fate/Grand Order** yesterday, it's pretty neat so far. I'm gonna finish it in these last few days it's up. Shadow of the Erdtree is out now though, so I'm gonna play that for a bit.",

            "Didnt manage to pass my exam on the first try. Im told its rare but you always hope maybe you managed to beat the odds. They are gonna send me some results in the next couple days that shows where I was weak so I can study. I also remember what the questions mostly focused on so should be easier the second time. Mostly bummed about having to pay full price to attempt it again. They asked some really specific questions that were basically impossible without first hand experience or knowing they are gonna be on the test. I dont wanna be conspiratorial but the fact you pay so much for the exam makes me think they make it like that so they can charge you twice for the exam. It didn't seem hard more so you have to specifically know certain things about how WLCs work. Probably not gonna have news on this for a couple weeks need to wait for next paycheck to try again.\n\nElden ring! About to go play the dlc so gonna keep it short. Iron pineapples preview of the game looked really good excited to see for myself",

Haven\u2019t delved to deep into the games but I do like what the show is presenting\n\nHazbin Hotel I put on as background noise expecting a low brow raunchy comedy.

            "I've (hopefully) finalised a new place to move into for when my current lease expires. By sheer luck, it's ended up being literally up the road from where I currently live. The rent is higher, which isn't great, but it's just with a single housemate rather than two. I sadly didn't get along particularly well with my last two housemates, so I'm hoping this will be a fresh start.\n\nI also applied for a promotion and got offered an interview today! A lot of people at work supported me for it, so I'm hoping it will go well.\n\nBetween getting ready to move in a month's time and preparing for a job interview in two weeks, I have a lot of previous anxieties that have been replaced by new ones. So, I'm going to spend my weekend distracting myself from all that with Shadow of the Erdtree.",
            "After an extended hiatus, I finally managed to play through and beat **Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth**. \n\nHonestly, while I do like the game and it left me satisfied overall, I do feel mixed about it as a whole. Not because I think it does anything particularly bad, but more so that I think I'm hitting a major fatigue point with the franchise that I kind of feel like I know exactly what I'm getting into with every entry structurally. I get it, this is very much an annual and extremely iterative franchise, but after 10+ entries of roughly the same core formula, I feel like I need a really huge change to the formula beyond swapping the combat to a Turn-based RPG. I'm just not really sure though what that change up is that I'm looking for.\n\n  \nAside from that, I also dabbled a bit more into the Rhapsody: Marl Kingdom Chronicles and took a break from the second game to try out the first chapter of **Rhapsody III: Memories of Marl Kingdom**. This entry is definitely a major change up from the prior two titles that shared the same basic formula in favor of being an Live-A-Live style anthology, and the change up to the combat again from the more traditional JRPG party members into squads of JRPG characters is pretty insane; by the time I was done with the chapter, I had 16 characters out all throwing attacks at once, with is certainly pretty chaotic to say the least. It does seem like as a result of this anthology approach the world design as been heavily streamlined so far, which is a bit disappointing after the full scale JRPG world of the previous titles, but I'm willing to give the shift a fair shot and appreciate it for the strengths it brings to the table.",

            "**What a week.** A good one, actually. Two days off thanks to holidays. On my days off I've been walking the line of doing nothing so I can rest, and being productive enough to not hate myself. I also made headway with my internal monologue at work; telling myself, \"You belong here, you're making progress in this job\" is enough to keep the spiraling away.\n\n**Trail watch**. Did a trail walk on Tuesday in hopes of starting again, but it's been raining here in town all week since. I can at least put in an hour's walk and do 3 miles a session. I saw the pair of cardinals that hang out in the groves. I'm glad they're doing well, I missed seeing them.\n\n**Books watch**. I put *Left Hand of Darkness* to the side so I can read my overdue library books, lol. I started and finished ***Regarding The Pain Of Others*** **by Susan Sontag**. At the risk of bringing up politics in the fartgas sub, I want to recommend this book to anyone who's had trouble processing what at this point amounts to a lifetime of seeing images of real-life violence, war, and genocide in the news. Sontag does a good job presenting the history and psychology of war photography and the dissemination of genocide imagery, and she challenges the idea that the horror alone will ever be enough to stop war. There's a line from her book that I think is perfect:\n\n>Compassion is an unstable emotion. It needs to be translated into action, or it withers. The question of what to do with the feelings that have been aroused, the knowledge that has been communicated. If one feels that there is nothing 'we' can do -- but who is that 'we'? -- and nothing 'they' can do either -- and who are 'they' -- then one starts to get bored, cynical, apathetic.\n\nI also got back into ***My Year Of Rest and Relaxation*** **by Ottessa Moshfegh.** I'm not done but so far I like it. It's darkly funny, thanks in part to the uncanny way Moshfegh depicts characters like the narrator's self-obsessed friend Reva and the sketchiest psychologist alive Dr. Tuttle; not to mention the way she casts horrific scenes of abuse and cruelty as completely mundane. But I'm also running up against my attention span reading this because the beginning is slow and it's very withholding about where it's going, if anywhere. Am I irrevocably monkey-brained? Possible. But I'll report back next week and let y'all know.\n\n**Video games.** I'm abysmal at ***Mega Man X*** and I will be taking no further questions on the matter.\n\n**Music.** I'm actually spending today cleaning out my backlog, finally. This week, I've enjoyed ***El Mal Querer*** **by Rosal\u00eda,** ***Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix*** **by Phoenix,** and ***Wonderland*** **by Demdike Stare.** I hate to say I finally listened to all of ***Playing Robots In Heaven*** **by James Blake** and felt kinda cold on the second half of it.

Probably going to play Black Mage or Dancer until I unlock Viper and Pictomancer. Started leveling Arcanist with the intent of leveling Scholar so I can finally learn healing. Could use Sage but don\u2019t want to jump straight into the deep end and figure it might be better to level a healing class normally to get a hang for the role.\n\nOther than that\u2026 \n\nWatched two anime movies this week while I was dogsitting. \n\nFirst I watched **Sword of the Stranger**\u2026 Holy fuck, that might be one of the best action anime I\u2019ve seen. I understand why that won a bunch of awards and was submitted for the Academy Awards. Idk why it wasn\u2019t chosen that year since there were only 3 nominations for animated feature film that year, but oh well. Fuck em. Studio Bones fucking nailed it though. Animation was fantastic, and Yutaka Nakamura popped off as usual. Some raw wipeouts in that movie >!like every side character ate it so hard lol!< Music was phenomenal and that main theme got me so emotional, especially >!when Nanashi finally drew the sword!<. Glad I finally watched it.\n\nThen a few hours after that, I watched **The Night is Short, Walk on Girl**, animated by Science Saru and is from the same creator as Tatami Galaxy and Penguin Highway. This one being about a girl out on the town, living it up, having zany adventures, while the guy that likes her is trying to keep up with her antics while having an awful night. Whole movie is a visual feast with constant classic animation techniques. Science Saru always having that classic cartoon style of animation, but with anime characters. Just a super fun time and if you like animation or that creator\u2019s other stuff, then it\u2019s definitely worth a watch.\n\nFinally, I finally picked **Monstress** back up after like two years.

In the past, motivation and lack of long-term planning have been major roadblocks, so my solution has been to set a 12-month goal I can work towards, and one that forces me into situations that are not easy to back out of. Namely: by 6-17-2025, I plan to have completed the 12 sub-5-mile hiking trails in my local region of the Ozarks. This week I got a bunch of advice from various sources, most notably /u/Terthelt hooking me up with a list of gear from a season professional hiker she knows, and I bought/ordered most of the things I will need. This Saturday I'm going to a local hunting store to pick up some bear mace, but otherwise I'm ready...gear-wise at least.\n\nExercise-wise, I'm aware it won't be smart to jump in the deep end first, so I've started taking a 1-mile walk around my local park as of yesterday. I'll be doing it every other day until my legs and core are good enough to go once a day, and then I'll be confident in starting the real hikes.\n\nAs for games, I've played about an hour of Shadow of the Erdtree. >!I went left into a basement and died to what feels like a DS2 player invader, so instead I went to the right and [was ambushed by a Bloodborne NPC.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0mWx8oFMlI)!< Going great so far.\n\nTomorrow/today my final exam for the first of two summer classes takes place, and I only need a 52 to pass with a C, so I'm feeling confident.

Man, what a weird show. It's only six episodes long, but it feels like it blows through multiple seasons worth of plot points, which is both a positive and a negative. I found it to be pretty enjoyable overall, though, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed all the Ubisoft cameos and references. When the show first got announced, I thought it would be a cynical cash grab, but it's not. I'd recommend it, especially since a second season is coming soon to resolve the cliffhanger ending. Also, as an aside, the show seems to acknowledge that Watch Dogs 2 is the only entry in that series worth caring about, which is fair.\n\nAlso, I started playing **The Ascent**. It's pretty good so far, but I only played it for an hour, so I don't have much to say except that it's got an impressively detailed cyberpunk setting.\n\nFinally, are there any **Hi-Fi Rush** fans reading this who are Korsica/Peppermint shippers? I'm looking for a beta reader for a fanfic I wrote. I usually don't ask for a second opinion, but I went with what might be an odd structure for this story, so I'd like to get some feedback on the pacing before I publish it. Also, it's my first time focusing on romance in a story \u2014 I've previously only had romantic subplots \u2014 so I'd generally like to know if it's any good. So, if you want to read roughly 27K words of two high-strung women pining for each other, having a misunderstanding, getting advice from their friends, and eventually working it out, let me know.",

I ended up seeing a comment somewhere off hand calling it the \"lesbian cut\" and sure enough if you Google that it's exactly what I wanted but I felt awkward in calling it that at the salon so I just saved multiple pictures as reference material instead lmao. Technically this was my second attempt because my first one at a different place I didn't have any pictures as reference and again trying to explain the style can be pretty difficult so the first attempt ever ended with the entire length being cut off instead.
