If the next guy wants to wear boat shoes and cargo shorts, cool. Most people on bikes are adults and can make their own adult decisions. We don't need the constant soap box standers. Me? I wear gear.

            "NGL- Above 90 to 95 and especially if it\u2019s sunny, I usually just drive. For part of my life, my only transportation was a motorcycle and I had to ride in rain, low temps, high temps and, hell, even tropical storms. \n\nNow, my bikes are a pleasant pastime and I don\u2019t really feel like sweating my balls off for fun. \n\nIf that makes me less \u201chardcore\u201d in the eyes of other riders,  I don\u2019t give a shit.  \n\nI also have higher low temperature limits.  I used to ride dirt bikes in the western NY snow at temps that would be tough to just be outside in. Now, below 60, I throw the dogs in the truck and drive around.\n\nThe high temperature limits are in place because I only ride in full gear. Gloves, jacket, pants, full face helmet and associated pads.\n\nI will say that the jacket and gloves in this photo look like they flow a lot of air. What brand are they?",
            "Ehhhhh it's all a tradeoff and depends where and what I'm riding. I wore a vest over my t shirt with riding jeans today cruising around town. If I'm gonna go on a real longer ride I'll wear mesh gear. If it's over 100 I'm taking my truck.",

In the case of a slide, you want your body parts to slide with you. Rubberized material will drag rather than slide which can be dangerous.  Keep up the great outlook!",

            "They do make gear for hot climates, I\u2019ve been hit by flying stones while riding without gear on and frankly I\u2019ll keep the gear.  My wife complains about gear too, and yet has a gash scare on her knee from a scooter accident, right in line were knee pads would have been.",
            "I worked in Phoenix, AZ in a level 1 ER. As a rider, one patient that I still remember is the motorcycle accident in August who was wearing a tank top and shorts when a car cut in front of them. They landed on their back and had fractured vertebrae. They then stayed on their back, in the middle of the day until the paramedics could safely transfer them onto the backboard. They ended up with 2nd/3rd degree burns on their back, arms, and legs. \n\nEven in the summer, please dress for the slide.",

Lmfao",
            "Woooooow so brave. Pull your cuffs down. In a slide theyll catctch and roll. Best to get a jacket that fits you. Also, get some actual motorcycle gloves. Those Mechanix gloves won't protect you. Quality gear makes for a quality slide",

Mesh gear is objectively better than no gear. If it is somehow not suitable for a rider, I think they should reconsider riding in that weather. Just like a lot of folks not riding in cold weather.
