I used BF-109G's to substitute since i only had 2 Hvars. \n\nI found out the hard way that a Sirius, Laffey and Helena comp does not work well at all, either you put Laffey as the main tank and get your entire vanguard nuked in about 30-40 seconds and Helena will die before she can get the second radar scan off even if she is placed in the middle slot.\n\nThat is where Anchorage shines, her smoke screen works very well when the META boss constantly prevents your vanguard  from moving.  This allows your vanguard to survive long enough to get off 4 airstrikes.\n\nAlso it seems that large cruisers can survive long enough but just barely",
            "Tried Different comps that re suggested by CN and NGA , However still can't get consistent results My Auto Ball parks is at 900k-1100m Dmg dealt( YKII, Enterprise, Kearsarge, Sirius, Plymouth, Guam). And Manualing nets almost 1200m . Oh well I'll probably wait for some good comps this coming weeks.",

From reading her abilities, she kinda just sounds like a DPS check (kill her before she kills you type of thing)\n\nAdditionally, I see a lot of ppl in the thread using fleets with CVs. Would a triple BB fleet with Helena not be the highest DPS?",

There are some tweaks I could make to the vanguard gear - I didn't bother changing any of their usual gear / stealing any of the unique auxs from my PvP fleet because I'm too lazy to keep doing it every day if I don't need to but I could probably eke out a little bit more / be more reliable with Pearl's Tears and Beaver Badge in the mix and giving Agir an Azuma gun instead of one of the AP CB guns.

            "Currently using a BB fleet (Bis\u00b2, Vanguard, Alsace // Plymouth/Mogador/Hindenburg), which worked well enough, getting a one-shot in level 14 by the skin of their teeth. I'll likely get the aforementioned teeth kicked in once level 15 rolls in, so I'll have to tweak it a bit.\n\nAlso I discovered that Mogador's shooting is enough to trigger Alsace's improved Divine Sanction near instantly, so a second or two of manual play is enough to ensure that her first salvo applies the debuff for the entire fight. It's not game-changing by any means since the backline is in sync anyway but hey, free damage for the vanguard is free damage for the vanguard.",
            "Tried BisZ, Alsace, Soyuz; Ply, LII, Hinden. All BB used +10 Mk7 (BisZ is +13). Gold FP Radar + White Shell.\n\nStill can't one shot, about 90% - 95%. Soyuz damage is quite low, probably need to play around a bit more.",
            "Rather than glitch, it simply means that her skill has higher priority over the enemy's.",
            "It'll be interesting to see how Mogador does in this fight in the long run, considering she's not particularly durable but does have some impressive DPS.  You can also boost Mog's dps a little bit further with the crit boost from Alsace's third skill.",
            "Meta showdowns seem to have always been aimed towards mid-late game players, so progressing campaign to get to chapter 9, then raise a second fleet, then on to chapter 12 is a higher priority if you aren't there already.  Michita should be added to the dossiers a year after her showdown ends, so missing her now isn't the end of the world.\n\nA level 120, or better yet level 125, fleet with a strong tank and Helena retro synced to your back line is where you want to start.  Anchorage is probably the most accessible tank who's competent in this fight, but she still needs to be dev 30.  \n\nThe rest is going to depend on what your dock looks like.  A CV fleet might work well enough, even without optimal anti-light gear, to 3 or 4 shot the boss with Enterprise, Ark Royal retro, and whatever other strong boss-fleet CV you have, but I'd have to test.  You'd probably want either Sirius or Kazagumo in the vanguard for that.\n\nIf you don't have Enterprise, a shelling damage BB fleet that uses the purple 406mm Mk6 main guns might be your best option, but who to use is going to depend on who you have.",
            "For newer players... Make sure to use your support request often. It's quite difficult otherwise, unfortunately.\n\nLater on, you can aim for 4-5 attempts clear in mid-game stages.",
            "Tbh when I was new I spammed world help requests. I don't think you'll be able to build a decent fleet for this fight, yet. It seems kinda hard.",
            "Small updates just to fulfil my curiosity.\n\n(1) Swapped Sirius for Harbin, then rearranged the vanguard to Ply - Laffey II - Harbin while also padding their HP by changing their aux. The chain doesn't do an EVA check, therefore making HP padding > evasion.\n\nOverall DPS is still lower than using Sirius but not that much (50-100k difference on average, I think). Sirius is still a better option though, because her buff is permanent (independent from her survivability) and her damage is quite low anyway, so you can just give her 'bad' equipment (compared to me giving Mog gun for Harbin).\n\n[Formation + Equip](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/788524464445980692/1253986350743687218/fotor_1719043079929.jpg?ex=6677d94b&is=667687cb&hm=386663ecc463325c8439d1feb79b8336c2deb29534c04745afe7becc6764f4fa&).

Swapped HPFCR for Black Shell, then gave LII and Ply +13 550 HP aux. Also tried giving Sirius a better gun. \n\nSirius gun upgrade is useless; just a small increase (10k-20k damage). I'm more confident with the survivability though; making LII survivability more consistent on auto. \n\n[Equip](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/788524464445980692/1253986351758708836/fotor_1719043281676.jpg?ex=6677d94c&is=667687cc&hm=ff4ee0a0a03252d8e2438bca03ed931359b0fbc77986ed59412f3fd86f692aea&).

            "I also tried this fleet and had some good runs with a few one-shots versus level 14, but I'm not feeling too optimistic about level 15. Helena RNG aside, my vanguard ended each fight in tatters. I'm drawing a blank on how to keep them safe on auto.",

            "The top 2 listed on NGA are 4-strike and 3-strike Kearsarge mixed comps and both *require* 2 procs to oneshot assuming everything is up to speed including oaths, reload techs and +13 enhances.\n\nThe 5-rocketcat Kearsarge CV comp after that can kill with 1 scan but is you're at risk of not doing enough damage if you lose Plymouth early and lose her buff on Kearsarge, or just the entire vanguard wiping with about 15s left on the clock (happened to me 1 our of my 5 runs last night).\n\nThese are their \"recommended\" oneshot comps.\n\nThe gist of it is 3-strike comps are actually slightly more reliable because your last strike's timing is going to be earlier so the vanguard is going to need to survive for shorter, but assuming your vanguard somehow makes it you get one less chance to roll Helena.\n\nBy the looks of it we're not going to get significantly better comps, and we're not getting a new UR before the season ends. *Maybe* next event or EN anniversary may bring a ship that somehow helps the fight, but I'm not optimistic.",
            "She is technically a DPS check, with the caveat that she does pretty heavy vanguard damage, and the more damage she takes, the more damage she deals.\n\nProper setup CVs with Hellcat(HVAR) are some of the highest anti-light damage out there. You can still use Helena with that, alongside other CV buffs. I believe CV comps are somewhat preferable this time in the sense it buys your vangaurd slightly more time with screen clears.",
            "Agir doesn't want a HE gun for this one -  if you want to try giving her better anti-light output without losing her dmgred you can give her a drake gun.\n\nSome comps using Brest are giving her unzen gun, unlike the other rainbow CBs she doesn't have much tied to using a large calibre gun.",

            "Well, I've been playing for two years and can do ~1m damage per attempt without Helena (ie no RNG). Shinano is not particularly good for this fight because she doesn't have that many fighters; currently the meta for light ships prefer fighters with rockets, while Shinano prefers torp bomber which is more suited for med/heavy.\n\nOutside of gearing and having the right ship, there are two problems to make a one-shot compo. The first is fleet tech bonuses. You need to Lv120 lot of ships to maximise important points: RLD, HIT, AVI for CV. This one takes time, but everyone can do it (eg my RLD stat for CV and BB is almost maxed).\n\nThe second one is oathing. At 200 affections, your stat will be boosted by 12% (vs 6% at 100 non oath). However, oath rings are expensive. Yes, you'll get 1 for free every anniversary, but you need to oath basically the backliners anyway. So yeah. I'm not oathing for stats too, for the record.",

She doesn't care if she is chained or not, her skill helps with her survival to some degree. She can't live longer than 60 seconds though even on level 14. She deals around 160k-200k damage on Auto on level 14.",
            "The first step is to not use a random-ass collection of ships that do not stand out power-wise nor have any synergy. I'm guessing you're fairly new? In that case you are going to struggle as the META showdowns are end-game content. Make use of those support requests, also focus your resources on leveling some strong ships that work well together.\n\nHere's one run:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1ira3pxxu7d1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9b85f6f38d2b753132c0a868ec034194fd1b612",
