Notice the black end piece on the sharpie? That is a removable stamp, which in this case is a cross. Also on the end is a little sticky putty which allows him to stick it to his finger. During the introduction of the trick he stamps the hand, for example, \u201cput your hands out, a little further apart(while moving the hands.\u201d Next the ink from the sharpie is designed to dissolve with moisture. Typically spit or condensation from a glass which you can get on a finger through the performance. This is a phenomenal trick and worth the purchase.!<",

If anyone wants to know DM me and I'll tell you but otherwise enjoy the mystery of magic...\n\nOk a bunch of people want to know so here's the answer \n:\n\n>!The thing is we didn't see the full trick there. The sharpie he's holding has a stamp with the X on the end of it so before the trick the magician will check or position their hands and while doing it apply the stamp. Then the actual ink from the sharpie (if I recall) rubs off so they do the stamp at the very beginning (he prob did it \"checked her hand\" and then told her to put it behind her back), draws his X, rubs it off with his fingers and then goes through the act to finally have her check her hand. If you look it up it's called the magic X sharpie or something like that. Still wild to see it pulled off but when I saw it live at a wedding I was absolutely mind blown (and drunk)!<",

The sharpie he's holding has a stamp with the X on the end of it so before the trick the magician will check or position their hands and while doing it apply the stamp. Then the actual ink from the sharpie (if I recall) rubs off so they do the stamp at the very beginning (he prob did it \"checked her hand\" and then told her to put it behind her back), draws his X, rubs it off with his fingers and then goes through the act to finally have her check her hand.

That's forced airflow, not the same, and even if this person was \"surprised\" by this, this isn't BLF at all, it's a person messing with combustibles, playing like they didn't know, in front of a camera. \n\nYeah, I'm slightly old, but seriously, we are deviating what is actually amazing, even if it's broken down, \"magic,\" then you have idiots with $6000 worth of electronics with no purpose going, \"Whoa!\"",

            "Exactly. Copper tube beside the flame contains a second wick that goes into the fuel chamber, so it's soaked in lighter fluid. There's a tiny pin hole in the end of the copper tube to create the jet.\n\nA great many of these end up broken because someone tried to clean the pin hole with a needle or pushpin,  which ends up widening the hole and reducing the pressure within. They originally came with a \"jet cleaning probe\" which is just a tiny wire attached to a metal handle. By my best measurement, that probe is .1mm or less - Though my cheap calipers are only accurate to .1mm so I don't fully trust the measurement.",

Half of it flips over to reveal a red card. Magnets would help keep the flap folded.\n\nThe wrinkles of the card is done with strings, then it gets pulled into his shirt.

If I didn't think it was impressive, I wouldn't have studied it for three days. \n\nI have some ideas. I'm on mobile, don't hate too hard. \n\nHis shirt is literally made of pockets. Each pocket has a little \"flap\" which could conveniently conceal a deck of cards. I think the \"card litter\" (CANT GET MY HEAD AROUND THAT LEVEL OF SKILL) was a deck conceal and finger produce. He showed off each deck litter differently, but overall he produced about 300 cards. I think each deck was \"palmed\" out of a pocket and then littered with extreme skill. \n\nI have to admit, the card crush was impressive, but turning it into a rod happened too quickly to appreciate the trick. I have to assume that was a camera trick. \n\nThe moving diamonds and the color changing card were definitely not the same \"trick.\" While the moving diamonds were spectacular to watch, I thing the color change stole the show. That was truly unbelievable. \n\nThe spinning card (extremely impressive, not taking away from that. Just my honest opinion and best guess) was chosen. The moving figures was done (again! I THINK) by verrrrry small strings. The final color change was done my the same mechanism. A full pull on the tiny strings. \n\nIf you've ever seen r/blackmagicfuckery before, you will have seen the woman who changes clothes like 30 times. You also should have seen the masked man doing kibuki theater with new aged nuance. \n\nTl;dr. This is fucking phenomenal skill. Any distinction between this and actual magic is VERY slim.",

            "You don't need a stooge to choose 3 to always land on red- if they choose one, two, or six you count the number of letters instead of the actual number. If they choose four you count starting at the blue gem side. If they choose five you count the letters starting from the blue gem side.",
            "Watch it a few times you can start seeing the rotations. But it took a few watches.",
            "Magick Balay is amazing at sleight of hand. About 12 years ago I was hanging out at a hotel pool in Phoenix and he was staying there. Ended up doing a bunch of tricks for our group right there poolside. Really nice guy as well, had a TV show briefly that was pretty good called Close Up Kings.",
            "That\u2019s fuckin badass!",
            "Get the hell out of here.",

            "What happens if he said 1, 2, 4, 5, or  6 at the beginning? \n\nClearly, one side had all rubies.",

            "They are not rubies, they are mini Infinity Stones",
            "That's a cool ass ring tho",
            "I love this. This is so cool.",
            "What if they choose 12 5 or 6?",
            "If they write #Magick like this you know it's the real deal.",
            "So what if he had said \u201cone\u201c instead of \u201cthree\u201d, which is not a ruby? Or was the first guy in on it?",
            "Flip sticks aren\u2019t magic anymore.",
            "WARLOCK!!!!!",
            " That eye has seen some sh** XD",
            "Okay so one side is red as the other side is different colors? He's just flipping it really fast? \n\nI'm guessing the guy with the camera is in it as well cause if he would have choose a different number instead of 3 it would have landed on a different color and not work?",
            "Black magic cheesery",
            "Watch his thumb. Neato!",
            "I use to have one of these. Lol. Six you say? S-I-X. The ruby!",
            "Good sleight of hand, the stick has rubies on the back from the beginning so the guy when he shows the other side he actually just spin his hand and smoothly show the same side.\n\nFor the choice of rubies out of the 6, he can have the same result with number 3 or 4 but nothing else comes to my mind, he also has red sunglasses maybe it has something to do with it, or just simply the guy filming is working with him.",
            "That is one fast flip...",
            "This motorcyclist has some serious skills!",
            "Slow it down and watch his right thumb roll it",
            "man, I miss when this sub had actual black magic fuckery. This is obviously some elementary level sleight of hand shit",
            "If you go frame by frame you can see him rotate it but yeah that is incredibly smooth slide of hand",
            "It\u2019s cuz he\u2019s real good at covering his fingers as he rotates it. If you check the positioning of his fingers before and after the gems \u201cchange\u201d you can see how he\u2019s doing it but at full speed man it\u2019s hard to catch",
            "How does rotating make it change?",
            "You can see his fingers are holding it in a different spot, but not the flip itself. Sick",
            "yeah, the thumb and pointer finger change",
            "If I said one and the guy said Ahh 3 letters, 1, 2, 3! I would make [a face](https://media1.tenor.com/m/eM1Xep-dE8wAAAAC/wtf-blink.gif) but still be impressed.",
            "I\u2019d just have them pick a color, and tell them \u201cwrong\u201d if they didn\u2019t pick red",
            "Happy cake day",
            "So the real trick is forcing the person to pick three?",
            "I still can't really see the rotations but you can notice his thumb and index finger swapping which one is protruding more, so you can tell he's spinning it. But it took a couple rewatches to notice and it is smooth as hell.",
            "Dude's such a fun magician, he's very charismatic with his patter!\n\nFor anyone who might be interested, [this vid is from his instagram for his store, Don't Blink Magic Shop.](https://www.instagram.com/dbmsnyc) And it seems he's working on making an [online store](https://dontblinknyc.com/) for it. Dude deserves the support.\n\nBit of a thing on why that's important. Like most things, learning magic has become more accessible by being taught online, whether through free tidbits or paid products and tutorials. This, and changes in the economy overall, has generally led to a decline in the structure of older things, such as the mentor/student relationship, some creators not creating/selling *any* new magic for fear of piracy, and physical stores for selling magic. I'm pretty late to the game in terms of interacting and socializing with other magicians, but even in my observation, there have been fewer and fewer magic shops in NYC. Tannen's is the oldest and for a bit was the only magic shop left in NYC (nigh every magician in the area buys their stuff there and hang out there) - I've seen Magick help demo and sell some things there. So for Magick to *start* his own shop is a brave move. He's also making it a space for magicians to buy stuff and hang out. When I visited, I was able to get a few things there I couldn't get at Tannen's. An impulse buy I got there, he actually opened it and demonstrated it for me, and gave me a quick lesson on it. His patter was so different than the others I've seen, I'm working on making my performance of it my own. I haven't had the time recently, but I'd definitely wanna visit again, and definitely would buy some stuff if/when he can start selling online.",

            "You count to the correct color in one of these ways:\n\n1. O-N-E\n2. T-W-O\n3. 1-2-3\n4. 1-2-3-4 (starting from the other end)\n5. F-I-V-E\n6. S-I-X\n\nSo you're always counting either 3 or 4 steps no matter what number is picked. It definitely seems less suspicious if they pick 3 or 4, but it works no matter what. Fortunately people told to pick somewhere in the range between two numbers tend to pick toward the middle. So most people asked for a number 1-6 will give you either 3 or 4 usually anyway.",

At first when he flips it up to show it's different colors on both sides, he actually rolls it over as he lifts it so you're still looking at the same side, but it looks like he's flipping it over. Then when he waves his hand over it to change it to all rubies, he just rolls it to the other side. Then lift/rolls again to make it look like it's ruby in both sides.",
            "At the end when he gives it back the camera man turns the stick there you can see it clearly",
