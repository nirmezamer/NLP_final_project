        "content": "Dear mildlyinterested reader,\n\nWe want to extend our heartfelt gratitude for your patience and unwavering support during the recent turbulence in our community. Our subreddit is a labour of love, and we've weathered this storm together.\n\nRecent events have been confusing for all of us, from the vote, sudden removal of moderators, to conflicting messages from Reddit. As your mod team, we feel it's essential to clarify the situation.\n\nOn June 19, [the poll results favoured partially reopening with changes](https://redd.it/14dmkw1). However, before implementing these changes, Reddit took sweeping actions, removing all 27 moderator accounts without warning. This left us baffled and concerned.\n\nHere's a brief timeline of the events:\n\n1. On June 19, the poll results favoured partially reopening with changes. We announced the vote results and planned changes to the sub, including marking it as NSFW due to the common posts of phallic objects (no explicit content allowed). [CLICK HERE TO VIEW THAT ANNOUNCEMENT WHICH HAS BEEN APPROVED AND LOCKED FOR POSTERITY](https://redd.it/14eox9x).\n\n2. A tug-of-war between the u/ModeratorCodeOfConduct account and the remaining moderators ensued, with the post repeatedly being removed and reinstated. Each mod involved was immediately locked out of Reddit. Subreddit settings were also unilaterally changed by the admin account.\n\n3. Eventually, all moderators were removed and suspended for 7 days, with the vote results deleted and the community set to \u201carchived.\u201d \n\n4. A lot of public outrage ensued, with details posted on r/ModCoord about what happened. At that point, no other subreddit had been targeted yet, leaving the situation uniquely unclear.\n\n5. Admin cited actions as an \"error\" and promised to work with us to solve the situation. For /r/mildlyinteresting posterity, this will henceforth be referred to as The Mistake\u2122.\n\n6. All our accounts were unsuspended and reinstated, but only with very limited permissions (modmail access only). For what it's worth, 'time moderated' for every moderator was reset (e.g. /u/RedSquaree moderated since 11 years ago, reset: currently showing moderated since \"1 day ago\").\n\n7. The awaited discussion never happened. Instead, the admins presented us with an ultimatum: reopen the subreddit and do not mark it as NSFW, or face potential removal again. The inconsistent and arbitrary application of Reddit's policies reveals a possible conflict of interest in maximizing ad revenue at the risk of user safety and community integrity.\n\n8. Finally, our moderation permissions were restored after we \"promised\" to comply with their conditions, but we kept the subreddit restricted while we ponder our next steps..\n\nProblems remain unresolved, and Reddit's approach to policies and communication have been troubling. We believe open communication and partnership between Reddit and its moderators are crucial for the platform's success.\n\nAs a team, we remain dedicated to protesting Reddit's careless policy changes. Removing ourselves or vandalizing the subreddit won\u2019t achieve our goals, but rather hinder our community. We're here to ensure r/mildlyinteresting isn't left unattended.\n\nWe call for the establishment of clear, structured, and reliable communication channels between Reddit admins and moderation teams. Teams should be informed and consulted on decisions affecting their communities to maintain trust and integrity on the platform. We shared this request with the Admin who promised to work with us, so far they have ignored it. \n\nUs mods are still deciding how exactly to reopen, not that we have been given much choice.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe r/mildlyinteresting mods",

            "Let's play a fun game called: remember all the other times Reddit refused to budge and insisted the users and mods were wrong until they eventually backtracked: \n\n\n\n* Banning r/Jailbait (it's exactly what you think it is) after literal years of user and moderator complaints, only once the media finally picked up on the story. Before this, Reddit had even given the creator of the subreddit a unique personalized award for his \"contributions to the website\"\n\n\n* Banning r/beatingwomen and r/picsofdeadkids only after the media picked up on a popular Reddit post from a user\n \n\n* Banning racist and Islamophobic subs because of organized actions from r/AgainstHateSubreddits and media coverage (r/European)\n\n* Reddit \"not knowing\" what to do with the sub r /ni***rs - no, the actual sub name was not censored and it was about exactly what you'd expect it to be about. Took user and media outcry over a period of months for Reddit to ban the sub. \n\n* Taking action against Covid misinformation (on all sides!) after moderator outcry and media coverage\n\n* Reddit CEO protecting r/The_Donald despite countless reports from moderators of politically themed subreddits of it being used for organized harassment and misinformation campaigns  - only reversing its stance after widespread media coverage. **Then**, u/Spez also messing with r/The_Donald by editing people's  comments to make it appear they were harassing the sub moderators instead of himself. Steve literally doesn't care about any of us, no matter our position.\n\n* Using Ellen Pao as a temporary CEO and blaming all unpopular decisions on her, when in reality it was co-founder Alex Ohanian who pushed for those changes aggressively. They then used her as a sacrificial goat for community outrage after which u/Spez was made CEO and presented as a savior. \n\nSources: \n\nhttps://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-r-jailbait-shutdown-controversy/\n\nhttps://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-r-jailbait-teen-pics-problem/\n\nhttps://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-beatingwomen-misogyny-images/\n\nhttps://www.albawaba.com/loop/reddit-bans-racist-and-islamophobic-subreddits-1101936\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/does-anything-go-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-racist-corner-of-reddit/277585/\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-page-calls-on-site-to-combat-covid-19-disinformation-2021-8?r=US&IR=T\n\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/n7jqbx/reddit-cant-quarantine-coronavirus-misinformation\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-38088712\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/29/reddit-bans-pro-trump-forum-in-crackdown-on-hate-speech-344698\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/women-often-put-charge-failing-companies\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3dbwmb/cmv_ellen_pao_was_put_on_a_glass_cliff_by_reddit/",

The only thing I'm protesting now is the continual downward spiral of my experience on Reddit, none of which is at the hands of any admins; it's all the mods.\n\nIf Reddit dies from these api changes, then it dies.

It has truly made this place special.\n\nNowadays, most semi-popular non-serious subs have become so repetitive with endless reposts, or lack of rigid moderation enforcement from mods due to fear of \"losing users\". Lots of once great subs became shit due to this (/r/MapPorn, /r/dataisbeautiful are two that immediately come to my mind). I genuinely appreciate the strict focus on original content (without memes) in this subreddit. I have so much more enjoyment from these authentic posts (even the \"not really that interesting\" ones) compared to reposts.

When it comes down to it, the mods of the sub are being told to go against what they feel is best for the community.  If that's the case, then why would you want to stay in that community at a moderator level?  They've already let you know how replaceable they think you are to this sub; time to move on.",

And it MUST be most mods; they have to be able to prove that they're willing to burn the site down and sacrifice their positions to make this point, and it won't work if only a handful of the biggest subs mark themselves NSFW.\n\nPersonally, I think Reddit is fucked either way, so the thing to do is to burn the site down before Spez can do it and profit from it.",

If you're a small enough sub, mods can literally enforce that the earth is banana-shaped as a rule, or establish their own high-school level promotion channel for a specific American school, even if the sub is ubiquitously named science or philosophy. Or if you have a legal matter sub that has become so hung up in US Democratic narratives that it literally is contradicted by the actual text in the reports (which they then ban you for even pointing out). The content being insane, that the mods are comically fascistic to the point where Eichmann would have been skeptical -- it has no bearing on anything whatsoever. As you point out, even subs dedicated to calling for actual law-breaking are not really a concern until their posts pop up at all or popular.\n\nEven though calls for holding ubiqitous subs (i.e., law, philosophy, science, etc.) to a slightly higher standard, or at the very least purging the mods every year or something like that - has been a long-standing request from - admittedly - a dwindling number of users over time, as they continue to get banned, or just settle in their own 40-people communities. This kind of content-moderation doesn't happen on Reddit in general, and never will. A /law sub that has to do with law rather than worship of the latest Muller-report leaks? Has no bearing on the advertisement revenue. No one is going to say: oy, this humorously insane sub is claiming that the earth is banana-shaped, and are calling on politicians to acknowledge them in the comments. This will stop us from selling hand-cream! Doesn't happen.\n\nWhat does affect Reddit's content policy, on the other hand, is the same that affects all other social platforms: does it negatively affect advertisement revenue. Or /appear/ to have a detrimental effect on it. And lack of clarity on that from Reddit has been a kind of wish to appear idealistic, on trying to be agnostic about it. Instead of them simply declaring - like face, twitterx and so on have - that they're just going to deamplify or bury anything that advertisers, state, CISA, private foundations, EU's twitter-domos, don't like with automated filters running outside the system otherwise. Which frankly is an ok solution, given that you are transparent with what you're doing. Because it really doesn't affect anyone who isn't invested in getting content on all or pop.\n\nYour sub, in that context, runs afoul of reports from brigades, irate former mods, and so on, that want to get the sub marked as sexually explicit. And by trying to do this in some consistent way - you're just creating bad press for Reddit, and getting problems by being in conflict with their content policy from a sheer PR-perspective. \n\nSo what did you actually expect?",

(Individual NSFW **posts** on a normally SFW sub can appear.)\n\nReddit admins have also complained that users who didn't expect to see porn were suddenly either shown porn in their main feed (if they had already [enabled NSFW content](https://i.imgur.com/savyvOS.png)) or were \"being prompted\" to enable it (if they hadn't). (If you are subscribed to an NSFW sub and don't have NSFW content enabled, maybe it shows a placeholder and gives you a convenient way to enable it? I haven't checked.)\n\nThat's the pretense they use for intervening. \n\nI think it's more the money part, personally\n\nAlthough I do have **some** sympathy for people who had previously enabled NSFW and trusted it to not be on their front page, since they hadn't subscribed to any porn subs.

If they had third parties willing and able to host it for them, why not continue with that zero-cost option and reap the benefits?\n\nThe other dumb thing here is that there are plenty of other monetisation options that actually work with how Reddit operates as a platform. They could have introduced additional Reddit premium tiers and included API access in one or more of those. Probably the best thing they could have done is pivoted into a Patreon competitor. There are plenty of content creators and people making physical items (First thing that comes to mind is the TTRPG community with digital maps and physical accessories) that already use Reddit to advertise their products & services, so why not give them a way to make a paid subreddit with multiple tiers that would effectively be a Patreon feed? Not to mention the hordes of posters advertising their Onlyfans or other similar platforms... Give them a good way to sell their stuff on Reddit and they'll probably see a large uptake on that. It's a much easier proposition to have a Reddit user stay on Reddit than to move off-site, and once a user has attached a payment method to purchase content/goods from those creators they're much more likely to use that payment method on Reddit premium and buy coins for awards.",

Pao was already unpopular enough, after the company shut down controversial \"subreddit\" communities like FatPeopleHate, and for many of Reddit's die-hard users, Taylor's dismissal was the last straw.\n\nBut if Wong's story is true, then it was really Ohanian's decision to let her go, not Pao's--something that Ohanian had hinted at in a Reddit post of his own, but never said outright. Meanwhile, Wong holds Ohanian responsible, even though Ohanian was supposed to answer to Pao and not vice versa.\n\n\n\"When the hate-train started up against Pao, Alexis should have been out front and center saying very clearly 'Ellen Pao did not make this decision, I did,'\" wrote Wong. \"Instead, he just sat back and let her take the heat. That's a stunning lack of leadership and an incredibly s***ty thing to do.\"\n\nIn a reply to Wong's post, Ohanian said \"It saddens me to hear you say this, Yishan. I did report to her, we didn't handle it well, and again, I apologize.\"\n\nWong replied saying that the company did \"tremendous amounts of unnecessary damage,\" and defended Pao by saying that she \"handled things very well, and with quite a bit of grace given the prejudices arrayed against her and the situation she was put in.\"\n\nWong himself abruptly quit Reddit late last year over what was apparently a dispute over office space. Pao served in the interim CEO job until last Friday, when she resigned. Steve Huffman, who co-founded Reddit with Ohanian in 2005, got the nod for the CEO job, full-time.\n\n--This story first appeared on Business Insider.",

Send formal citizenship checks to governments based on a screen name or email address? The wording is also extremely vague and not anywhere near as precise as anyone would like.\n\nThe GDPR mostly applies to activity that takes place within the European Union. So it's not so much about the person who is performing that activity, it's about where the data comes from. So citizenship, place of normal residence... doesn't actually matter that much. If you've ever used Reddit in Europe, you're probably covered in practice, because at least *some* of your data originated in the EU and there's no way they can be arsed to split hairs over it.\n\nMost companies that are GDPR-compliant are not going to get into the nitty gritty of where you're currently sitting or where you were sitting when you gave them each piece of your data - that would require time and effort that's just not worth spending, so instead they just have a GDPR request button that they hit to field GDPR enquiries. They don't actually have to give a shit about the validity of the request once the tooling exists to field the request, because what's the value to them in rejecting it?\n\nAll the button will probably do is change which data is included in the dump and Reddit's reporting and analytics (so that if they ever get in trouble over one of these regulations they can go \"look, we provided data to 145,919,258 people, please believe that we're super compliant!\").\n\nThe only companies who do care are probably not actually *really* GDPR-compliant because they're pulling the data manually, which is a huge pain in the ass, and hoping that nobody does it.

This was never about \"making poor old pauper reddit profitable\" by charging for the API, it was 100% designed to kill all other apps to create a monopoly. If that's the case, own it! Just fucking tell the truth about the motivations. And then to basically slander and lie about a 3P app developer to drum up sympathy.

The EU and the US are both massive entities with some considerably different protections. I'm no legal expert on this stuff, but it seems like Reddit skirts around labor laws due to their decentralized model - most mods are hobbyists who manage subs about their passions. Once you get to the major subs, things seem to get a lot murkier, though. \n\nSure, Reddit has a responsibility to police certain content, but their direct meddling in community affairs brings their role into question. Taking charge of communities that are following both Reddit's guidelines and the law, and going as far as replacing mods or shutting down subs, blurs the line between being a community platform and exploiting moderators for free labor. In the past, we've mainly seen this in subs pushing legal boundaries or extreme cases potentially making Reddit liable. But this case is different. This is clearly a response to their policy changes and their bottom line.\n\nYes, they have the authority to regulate their content. There are still limits on what they can demand from unpaid mod and a situation where they are attempting to unilaterally remove entire mod teams and select their replacements, from a labor standpoint, sounds sketchy to me at best. There being plenty of other people being willing to do the job for free doesn't justify it. \n\nThat's likely why the admins chalked up the action as an \"error\".

I've also been considering SMILE for myself. \n\nPros: **No glasses/contacts**, glare may improve \n\nCons: Light sensitivity, account of drops (compliance issues), some glare/halos may not go away, cost\n\nOther notes: Not everyone is a candidate for PRK/LASIK/SMILE. Healing takes a few weeks to a few months. May need a second procedure if the first wasn't enough. Need to make sure you keep a record of your eye info from PRIOR (usually give you a little card for your wallet) as it is vital for later on with cataract surgery - I really cannot stress how many patients that don't have their LASIK info and how surgery after the fact can be inaccurate due to the missing information. Eyes will still adjust as you get older and if you want, you can usually get LASIK repeated later on in life if you need a presbyopic adjustment. \n\nIt's personal preference at what is worth the risk and hassle. If you know you won't put in drops more than once a day, you shouldn't get LASIK as your compliance affects the outcome.

Basically the best the doctor could get your one eye to was 20/40 as opposed to all the way to 20/20. The minus two probably means you got two wrong on the 20/20 line on the chart, but the doctor/refractionist still thought you were better than 20/25 (the next line up on the chart). \n\nSource: used those exact notations during pretesting at work as an optician (not optometrist or ophthalmologist)",
            "20/20-2 is your visual acuity with the glasses on. On the particular line that denotes 20/20 on the chart, you missed 2 numbers (not a biggie) 20/40 means that you couldn\u2019t see the 20/20 line as clearly as you can the 20/40 line with glasses. The 20/40 with glasses on is probably due to your brain not using that eye as much due to 2.75 D of difference between the eyes (your brain is seeing images of different sizes so just doesn\u2019t use one eye)",
            "Eye tech here, there's a number of things to consider with vision and refraction. Cornea, lens, retina, and any refractive elements. The cornea has the most power in the eye ~43D. Shorter eyes typically have less power (need to + power) and longer eyes have more power (need to - power). This is also affected by astigmatism, or how round your eyeball is (think football or soccer ball). Next, the lens in your eye ages. It's why people have issues reading when they hit 45-60 and how a cataract develops. Cataracts can also cause astigmatism depending on how the lens thickens. The retina is like the film of a camera and it captures what we see. If there is an issue with the film, we won't get a good picture (and is very important for screening so get your eye exams). Lastly, any corrective lenses (glasses, contacts) are to sharpen your vision, but they won't help much if there are issues in any of the other areas. \n\nIn your case, the prescription tells me you're farsighted or that your eye is shorter than average. You do not have astigmatism listed (cylinder) which can also affect how clearly you see things. It is less common to have a differing prescription as well, and it's important to be monitored for anisometropia (something I also have) and amblyopia (also known as lazy eye). Knowing what you can see without your glasses provides a starting point, and knowing what you're seeing with your glasses is a helpful comparison. It is also important to note any decline in the vision or pathology.",

            "Myopia is different than just poor focus. It makes all light spread out into a star or halo, so everything looks slightly (or very) blurry no matter what the distance. This means that glasses make your vision sharper when they correct myopia, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily correspond to seeing farther.\n\nIn my case my vision isn\u2019t actually that bad but one eye has worse focus and myopia. As a result I completely avoided wearing glasses until I was 25 because \u201cyeah the whiteboard looks blurry from the back of the room but I can still read it if I TRY\u201d.

This is when you have more than 1.00 between the two eyes. Sometimes if this difference is large enough, as it is in your case, it can cause what is called refractive amblyopia which is a fancy way of saying one eye sees worse than the other. It\u2019s not super uncommon and not a huge concern depending on how well you see. \n\nSource: Me.

So, assuming no down time and using an 8 hour work day with no breaks at 20 minutes per patient, you would get 24 patients done per day.\n\n8hrs x 60min. = 480/20 = 24 patients/day.\n\nThere are 260 working days in a year, assuming no holidays or time off. So that would give you a total of  6,240 patients per year.\n\n260 days x 24 patients/day = 6,240\n140,000/6,240 = 22.43 years\n\nSo, at a rate of 24 patients per day, it would take almost 22.5 years to reach 140,000 procedures.\n\nIf each eye counts as 1 procedure and assuming most people get both eyes done, it would be 11.25 years. A little more realistic, but lasik would still make up approximately 50% of your working career.\n\nAlso, the average cost per eye in the US appears to be $2,000-$2,500. Assuming each patient gets both eyes done at $2,000/eye and each eye counts as its own procedure, that would be $280 million in Lasik.\n\nLike, I said, I'm not a Lasik expert, so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong or made too many assumptions.",
