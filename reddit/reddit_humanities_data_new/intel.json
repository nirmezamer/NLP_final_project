Also ensure your motherboard is compatible with the CPU you have \u2014 many modern Intel motherboards should have BIOS flashback, allowing you to update the BIOS without needing the CPU or RAM installed, please consult your motherboard manual as the BIOS flashback procedure can very depending on the make and model. When utilising BIOS flashback, we recommend using a USB 2.0 drive that is 8GB or less, some implementations of BIOS flashback do not work well with USB 3.0 drives and/or USB drives larger than 8GB\n\n* If you are using a high-end RX 6000, RX 7000, RTX 30 or RTX 40 GPU, please ensure you are using separate 6/8pin PCIe cables and not using daisy-chained or splitter cables, as these might not be able to supply adequate power \u2014 some GPUs have LED indicators by the connector to let you know if the GPU isn't receiving enough or consistent power, please consult your GPU and PSU manual on how to correctly connect your GPU\n\n* Make sure your memory modules (RAM) are installed in the primary DIMM slots, some motherboards will not start if the RAM is installed in the secondary DIMM slots \u2014 the primary slots should be labelled on the motherboard or specified in the motherboard manual\n\n* Make sure your Monitor or TV is plugged into the HDMI or DisplayPort output from your graphics card and not the motherboard \u2014 if this still doesn't work, try a different TV or Monitor and try different HDMI or DisplayPort cables to rule out any problems here\n\n* Make sure you are running the latest updates for your operating system, games and applications: these updates can help resolve many bugs and compatibility issues, especially with newer hardware or software\n\n* Scan your PC for any Viruses or Malware using Windows Defender or other reputable Anti-Virus or Anti-Malware solution \u2014 Malware, Viruses, Adware and other unwanted software can cause security, stability and compatibility issues\n\n* Make sure you are running the latest [Intel drivers](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html) and reinstall them. To reinstall GPU drivers and software, we recommend using [Display Driver Uninstaller](https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-) to perform a clean installation of the drivers, a guide on how to use DDU can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRRx_3r8GgCpBAMuhT9n5kK6Zse_DYKWvjsW0rLcYQ0/edit). To reinstall chipset, ME and other Intel drivers, we recommend letting Windows Update do them or by acquiring the latest from your system/motherboard vendors website\n\n* If a game is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, verify and repair the game files through Steam, Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect, EA App, GOG, Xbox, Battle.net or whichever game client you are using. Instructions can be found online for your respective game client \u2014 corrupt and/or missing files can cause games not to launch, crash and experience other performance and stability issues\n\n* If you are on Windows and are experiencing stuttering or lower than expected performance, make sure you are using the Balanced or High Performance power plan and restore them to their default values.\n\n* If a program is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please reinstall the program or attempt to repair the installation using the program installer/uninstaller \u2014 corrupt or missing files can cause programs to not launch, crash or experience other issues\n\n* Make sure you are running the latest BIOS, Firmware and Drivers for your motherboard, laptop, desktop and any other components and peripherals you have connected to your system. These updates often contain bug fixes, new features and improve compatibility and interoperability\n\n* If you have any overclocks, underclocks, undervolts, custom power curves or similar: **revert everything to stock clocks, timings, voltages and settings**, this includes disabling XMP/EXPO/DOCP \u2014 to do this, go into your BIOS and restore the factory settings \u2014 this is typically labelled 'Restore Default', 'Restore Optimized Defaults', 'Load Optimized Defaults' or similar\n\n* Stability test your system with the utilities linked below if you experience crashes, freezes, system shut-down or just want to check \u2014 just because your system turns on, doesn't make it stable. Many reading this post will have unstable systems and won't even know it\n\n---\n\n[OCCT](https://www.ocbase.com/) \u2014 Ocbase is the home of OCCT, the most popular all-in-one stability / stress testing / benchmarking / monitoring tool available for PC.\n\n[Prime95](https://www.mersenne.org/download/) \u2014 Prime95 has been a popular choice for stress / torture testing a CPU since its introduction, especially with overclockers and system builders. Since the software makes heavy use of the processor's integer and floating point instructions, it feeds the processor a consistent and verifiable workload to test the stability of the CPU and the L1/L2/L3 processor cache. Additionally, it uses all of the cores of a multi-CPU / multi-core system to ensure a high-load stress test environment.\n\n[AIDA64](https://www.aida64.com/downloads/latesta64xe) \u2014 AIDA64 System Stability Test uses a 64-bit multi-threaded stress testing module to drive the computer to its absolute limits. Hard disk, SSD and OpenCL GPGPU video adapter stress testing is also available.\n\n[Furmark](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/) \u2014 FurMark is a lightweight but very intensive graphics card / GPU stress test on Windows platform.\n\n[MSI Kombustor](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/kombustor/) \u2014 MSI Kombustor is MSI's exclusive burn-in benchmarking tool based on the well-known FurMark software. This program is specifically designed to push your graphics card to the limits to test stability and thermal performance.\n\n[MemTest86](https://www.memtest86.com/) \u2014 MemTest86 boots from a USB flash drive and tests the RAM in your computer for faults using a series of comprehensive algorithms and test patterns.\n\n[MemTest86+](https://memtest.org/) \u2014 Memtest86+ is a stand-alone memory tester for x86 and x86-64 architecture computers. It provides a more thorough memory check than that provided by BIOS memory tests.\n\n[SeaTools](https://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/) \u2014 SeaTools - Quick diagnostic tool that checks the health of your drive.\n\nFor more advanced SSD/HDD diagnostic utilities, please check the website of your SSD/HDD manufacturer, as they usually offer specialised software to test the drive and update firmware, some examples include Samsung Magician, Western Digital Dashboard and the Crucial Storage Executive.\n\nSome motherboards, laptops and desktops may also have built-in BIOS diagnostic utilities to stress test test certain components or the entire system. Please consult your motherboard or system manual for more information.\n\nA truly stable system should be able to run any of these utilities or built-in diagnostics without any crashes, freezes, errors or other issues. These utilities can help you narrow down which component(s) in your system are faulty, aren't installed correctly or have unstable overclocks/undervolts. \n\nIf you require help using any of these programs, please read the help sections on each website or use Google and YouTube, as there are a plethora of guides and tutorials available.\n\n---\n\n* If you have a custom built PC, recently upgraded, started overclocking or want to know if your current or future PSU will support a hardware upgrade, please use one of the below PSU calculator and make sure the PSU you have can output enough power when your system is under a full load \u2014 If your PSU isn't able to supply enough power, you are likely to have issues starting your system and may experience system crashes when under load.\n\n* PSU Calculators: [FSP](https://www.fsplifestyle.com/landing/calculator.html), [OuterVision](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator), [Cooler Master](https://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/), [Seasonic](https://seasonic.com/wattage-calculator), [Newegg](https://www.newegg.com/tools/power-supply-calculator/), [be quiet!](https://www.bequiet.com/en/psucalculator), [MSI](https://www.msi.com/power-supply-calculator), you can also add all your components into [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) and it will provide an estimate wattage\n\n* If you are using Windows 10 or Windows 11, use the built-in System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) commands to check for any corrupt or missing operating system files and attempt to repair them, a guide is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y7HOS6UiOBXAWtNFBJ0w70f14izRQcBYD9puuSw6Ghs/edit)\n\n* Try and apply common sense to an issue, for example if you have flickering on your TV or Monitor, try simple things like changing the HDMI or DisplayPort cable and port on the GPU and display you are using. If you've recently installed a mod and that game now crashes, uninstall that mod. If one of your memory modules is no longer being detected, is there any physical damage to the memory module, DIMM slot on the motherboard or pins, have you tried reseating it etc...\n\n* If you've tried all of the above and are still facing the same issue, please backup any important data and completely reinstall your operating system \u2014 we recommend using the latest official ISO image available. **The use of utilities which modify Windows or using 3rd party, custom or slimmed Windows ISO images can cause stability, security and compatibility issues**. For this reason, please use an official Windows 10 or Windows 11 ISO image direct from Microsoft. We would also recommend performing a clean install with a USB. Windows 10 and Windows 11 ISO images can be downloaded from the [Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download)\n\nIf you have done all the above steps and are still facing an issue, please follow the below template for submitting a request, the more detail you can include the better. **If you post something like 'cod crashes', don't list your PC specifications, what you've tried to resolve the issue or don't provide any helpful information, then don't expect a response, as there's not enough information to go on.**\n\n*Below is an example template you could use...*\n\n---\n\n**Summary of issue**: Graphical glitches when playing 'Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora' on 31.0.101.4972 if you have V-Sync enabled. This can be resolved if you revert to 31.0.101.4953.\n\n**What I have tried**: I have reinstalled 31.0.101.4972 with DDU, reset my in-game graphics settings, verified game files in Ubisoft Connect and confirmed issues is still present.\n\n**System Specifications:**\n\n* Operating System: Windows 11 22H2, OS Build 22631.2715 (to find OS build version, press the Windows Key + R and type *winver*)\n* CPU: Intel Core\u2122 i5-13400F\n* CPU Cooler: DeepCool AK620 with included paste and both fans\n* GPU: Intel Arc A750 8GB Limited Edition\n* Motherboard: MPG B760M EDGE TI WIFI with 7E11v12 BIOS\n* RAM: Corsair DOMINATOR Titanium 32GB DDR5-6000 CL30 w/ XMP \n* Storage: 4TB Seagate FireCuda 530 with Heatsink\n* PSU: MSI MPG A850G 850W ATX 3.0\n* Display: 27\" Samsung Odyssey G32A 1080p 165Hz with included DisplayPort cable\n\nFeel free to include any log files, dump files, videos, screenshots or images to assist others in understanding the issue.\n\n---",

            "**Summary of issue:** Intel Rapid Storage Technology app on Win 7 does not begin a rebuild of RAID\n\n**What I have tried:** I've got a ten year old machine with RAID 1 set up using Intel Smart Response Technology. Lately after several power cuts it started acting up in a way that suggests a drive issue, so I've decided to migrate from the 1 TB HDDs (by now 8 years old) to 2 TB SSDs.\n\nReplaced one of the HDDs in the RAID with one of the new SSDs. RAID shows as degraded, which is expected. According to what I can find and what I recall from the last time I did it 8 years ago, I should be able to begin a rebuild from the Rapid Storage Technology app.\n\nThe app prompts me to rebuild the RAID and offers to select the new SSD as a rebuild target. However, when I choose it as a rebuild target and click on the button to rebuild it, the SSD is marked as a spare and the RAID is still shown as degraded. After waiting a couple hours and refreshing the view in the app, there is no change from that state, and no indication that a rebuild was initiated. \n\n**System Specifications:** \n\n* MSI Z87-G43\n\n* 16 GB RAM\n\n* Core i5...

I installed the cpu and it is working at stock clocks, I can push it slightly to 5.7 all core in R24 and it is stable. but as soon as I try to push beyond that I get stability issues that are not consistent. I purchased the rocketcool ihs and while installing it noticed that the SMD that is circled in the picture (linked below) is missing. The pads are perfect, like they were cleaned. Im 100% certain I did not knock it off Ive delided several cpus and am very careful when handling delicate components. I am assuming the guy who sold it to me scamed me... I dont really want to try to get ebay to help me out, Id rather just replaced the SMD but I can not, for the life of me, find out the specifics of that cap.

That I'm hearing people say that CEP\u00a0*increases*\u00a0temperatures supports the notion that it is increasing the voltage. My personal experience (with an IA AC of 0.01) is that it decreases the temperature, but my sample size is very small (I only enabled it this morning).",
            "Why for the new Intel Ultra, the \"Memory Latency\" benchmarking are so low on User Benchmark website?",
            "I enabled CEP in the BIOS of my ASUS motherboard. This change alone was enough to reduce both single- and multi-threaded performance by between 50 and 60%. I knew there would be a performance penalty, but I didn't expect it to be this bad. I also knew there was something funky going on with my E-cores since they don't boost past 2.15 GHz under load now, but that shouldn't effect single-threaded benchmarks when my P-cores are still boosting up as expected. It's so bad that my old E-core only benchmarks exceed the performance of my whole CPU now (this is a 14900k, so there are a lot of E-cores).\n\n\\~\\~What's going on and what can I do to fix this?\\~\\~\n\nedit: Since CEP effects power, and \"current\" is in the name, I decided to tweak the power settings downward. I reclaimed most of the lost single core performance by reducing amps down to 220A and power down to 180W, but the multi-threaded performance still suffers as much as before.\n\nedit2: Further test show little change in performance by varying power settings. I think CEP is triggering really early as the result of a heavy undervolt. Under load, the CPU seems to draw 33W which is well below what I've set. Also, looking into this further, it seems CEP is to protect stability, not the CPU itself. I performed extensive stability testing and then backed off from those settings, so stability isn't a concern assuming the chip doesn't degrade.\n\nDoes CEP protect the CPU? If not, it seems I should just disable CEP.",

Intel recommends using these settings. If the BIOS update done by your pre-built computer manufacturer contains this Intel Default Settings, and you are not experiencing any of the constant crashes anymore then for now that is the fix for those kinds of issues. Please continue to monitor your system though and if you experience the same problems again, then you can always reach out to your system manufacturer again. \n\nIntel though is actively investigating the root cause of this issue, including manufacturing, design, and other potential factors.

But on these they only do 4K 60Hz. I also tried a bunch of other adapters and they all do 4K 60Hz and sometimes they even get a black screen. I contacted Cable Matters and they said it is an incompatibility on Intel\u2019s side and they cannot do anything on their side.

Are the features of the Killer Card (as in prioritizing bandwith for games etc.) active ONLY when I chose to download the \u201eKiller Control Center\u201c at the end of the installation of the \u201ePerformance suite driver package\u201c \nor are the features anyway active?\nOr are they already active after downloading the suite: ;https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19779/intel-killer-performance-suite.html) and installing it WITHOUT downloading the control center at the end?\n\n2. In case of the features being active even without the control center: When uninstalling the performance suite package via the windows uninstall tool, -> does that then lose the bandwith priorization functionality?\n\n3. Bonus question: why isnt the control center simply included in the original download of the suite?\u2026 to be honest the whole installation process is very complicated and confusiong understanding what is and does what ans whats necessary and whats a bonus etc.\n\n4. as a feedback also: Even though I chose manual installation of the killer performance suite and chose to only install the drivers without the software: \u2026. it simply installed the software anyways\u2026 just so you know, maybe that is a bug!? \n\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f Thank you so much",

            "[deleted]",
            ">It seems that there is something going on with your processor... are you also experiencing random crashes on your processor?\n\nNo, it's quite stable. Because of that, I'm more inclined to blame the motherboard than the CPU. But I do think something strange is going on. I read reports that enabling the Intel Basline Profile dropped performance by around 8% to 13% (depending on the reviewer), and that's down from using crazy power limits. For the sake of protecting my CPU, I've never run the thing at full power, even during my testing and for normal use set PL1 = 125W, PL2 = 180W, and Max current to 250A. With those settings, Geekbench6 gives a single-core score around 3200 and multicore of 19k+.\n\nFor some more concrete numbers please compare the following:\n\n[https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/5832156](https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/5832156)\n\n[https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/5843502](https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/5843502)\n\nThe first is with CEP enabled with the aforementioned power settings of 125W, 180W, 250A. The second result is with CEP disabled, but with PL1 = PL2 = 50W. That's not a typo, that's two digits. What's more, the first result was with no background load. For the second I ran just now, I have Discord and Emacs running and several Chromium tabs open. (For those unaware, Emacs is a terrible resource hog.)\n\nHere is a link to some Linpack results: [https://gist.github.com/nstgc/2128d757fc584c40fb3365a0fa635529](https://gist.github.com/nstgc/2128d757fc584c40fb3365a0fa635529)\n\nBoth were created using half the cores to prevent thermal throttling. The first is with my usual power settings. The second is with PL1 = PL2 = 250W and current set to 300A, but with CEP enabled.\n\nSo yes, I think something strange is going on.\n\n>Have you already tried the latest BIOS for your board, the one that gives you the \"Intel Baseline Profile\" option? Have you also tried to change SVID Behavior to Intel Fail safe?\n\nI am using the latest BIOS and I did use that as a starting point. Intel Fail Safe seems to mandate a lot more voltage than I need.\n\n>yes the CEP protects CPU\n\nHmm, I see. After having two CPU's get fried, I'm determined to not make this one #3. Still, this kind of performance loss is not something I can easily accept.",

            "In response to concerns regarding undervolting, it's important to note that undervolt protection is currently active within XTU as a precautionary measure following the Plundervolt issue. This issue previously allowed users to undervolt their processors to levels that could compromise system security. As a result, undervolt protection was introduced to safeguard the CPU's integrity. Due to this protection, undervolting capabilities are constrained by the BIOS voltage limits, which may vary between motherboards and users. Consequently, undervolting via XTU may not be possible unless BIOS values have been adjusted to permit it.\n\nIntel's stance is to refrain from recommending undervolting. Should users wish to undervolt in real-time, they would need to disable Undervolt Protection in the BIOS, which could potentially expose them to Plundervolt attacks. From a legal perspective, we cannot endorse such actions. This is the primary reason for the limited information available on undervolting. Nonetheless, users retain the option to undervolt through the BIOS settings, even with the protection enabled.",

            "https://www.reddit.com/r/spectrex360/s/sO8IUAaCI1\n\nI would like an explanation for this then. I have tried so many adapters yet a random one (USB-C to HDMI adapter) from AliExpress was the only one I could find to support 4K 120Hz on Core Ultra Arc iGPU through USB-C. I DO believe Arc iGPUs support 4K 120Hz and I would like a formal investigation on this to resolve this incompatibility issue with every other adapter. Because it is either up to Intel to resolve this, or to speak with known brands to find a resolution for this.\n\nI have been able to get 4K 120Hz working on an i7-1165G7, i9-12900H, and i9-13900H with Cable Matters adapters with 4K 120 and VRR with no issue. I don\u2019t understand why Core Ultra\u2019s are the only ones that \u201capparently\u201d don\u2019t support 4K 120Hz yet only one random adapter has been able to work for me. There\u2019s no reason why an upgrade in generation of iGPU\u2019s should reduce the resolution Hz performance on it. \n\nThank you for reading.",

            "I can't give a definive number, but I rarely see temperatures exceed 70C, and BIOS set to throttle at 80C. I have a 360mm AIO. Even MPrime (Prime95 for Linux) doesn't get it up all that high due to power throttling. The only thing that really pushes the temperatures is Linpack, but only if I let it, which is why I don't run it on the whole chip, nor on consecutive cores. The highest temperature I saw ever was 95C with the previous CPU because I thought it would be a good idea to run Linpack on just the E-cores or just the P-cores. I don't remember which it was, my plan was to do both, but I ended up canceling the test and not running it on the other set.\n\nAnd yes, ICCMax.\n\nedit: for what it's worth, the only time I ran this at stock power without CEP was for testing, and that phase of tested lasting less than an hour. I remember lifting the thermal throttle limit up to 90C for that, but it didn't hit it.\n\nIf you would like, I can turn the power back up and increase the clock speeds (I have those capped low too) and run something light such as a gaming benchmark, but I feel very uncomfortable with running MPrime or Linpack without strict limits imposed. Even compiling the Linux kernel would makes me uncomfortable. And when I say I'd turn the speeds back up, I would still rather keep them at or below 5.8 GHz, as that's the highest I tested. I know I could have pushed it higher, but again, I'm far more concerned about chip degredation than I am a little extra speed. This is CPU #3; I don't intend on there being a #4 any time soon.",
            "Why set the current so high? Is that solely to prevent throttling?",

The specifications we state on our website are theoretical values based on our testing, and we can only advise following the specifications as listed. Although there are ways to achieve 120Hz, since the bandwidth of the USB-C port allows it, as you have discovered, it would depend on the system configuration and build whether it will support that resolution without adverse effects on the hardware. Therefore, we can only suggest using the resolution listed as supported by your operating system. Any other setups are considered overclocking and running the system outside of specifications, which can pose risks to the system's longevity.",
            "To answer your question, the CPU was designed to spike to 4.7 GHZ when an application demands it and if thermal and power conditions allow for it to run at 4.7 GHZ. It would not stay boosted to 4.7 GHZ.",

            "Thank you for looking into the issue. I can understand where the overclock concept comes from in this case, but it stands out that every adapter or cable that I\u2019ve tried on Arc iGPUs, they all default to 4K 120Hz at an OS level. Meaning the Arc iGPU is communicating it does support 4K 120Hz, but it can\u2019t display it properly on all but one adapter for some reason. Why would the Arc iGPU not instead cap the Hz manually to 60Hz and gray out 120Hz instead? A lot of users will face this black screen bug, which is one me and my friend faced with the other adapters. Only using a second display allows to switch back the Hz to 60Hz. It\u2019s still just weird Iris Xe can do 4K 120Hz without issue, but its successor with double the performance in quite a few areas defaults to 4K 120Hz but with a black screen without a hardware logical explanation on why the regression in Hz spec. I hope some type of fix can be done somewhere for all adapters to \u201coverclock\u201d it right then, or for Arc to just refuse this resolution if 4K 120Hz is truly impossible without it, so the end user can benefit from one option or the other. In an ideal world 4K 120Hz on Arc iGPU would work, hope one day another solution would pop up for it. Cheers, and thanks again.",

            "Yes, I've used PL1 = PL2 = 250W with ICCMax = 300A without CEP. My motherboard has toggles for IA and SA CEP. Both were disabled. WIthout CEP, performance is great.\n\nOnly two died, and they were both 14700k's. When considering a replacement, I figured my luck would be better if I opted for a better binned model. (I don't really need the kind of performance an i9 offers over a 14th gen i7, but I, seemingly correctly, assumed I'd have better chances of not getting a bad chip.) For the first one, it was kind of wonky out of the box, but I also let my motherboard \"optimize\" my BIOS. I didn't use their AI Overclocking feature, nor overclocked in general, but I'm still pretty confident the board's default settings fried it. I was more careful with the second, and stuck to PL1 = PL2 = 253W and ICCMax = 307A... at least at first. The chip was acting increasingly poorly, requiring I continuously pump more power into it. Within a month and a half, I had increased that to 400W and 450A. Then I tried a severe underclock of 5.2 Ghz on the P-cores and something like 3.5 GHz on the E-cores, but it just wouldn't stay stable. I figured at that point, I'd be constantly chasing an ever more elusive island of stability, and so gave up on that chip and bought the current one.\n\nOh, and prior to recent reports recommending enabling CEP, I never used it. My board defaults those settings to disabled and I never really thought anything of them.\n\nI'm going to be kind of frank, I'm a bit sour about having to repurchase a CPU, especially since I don't have any use for this burnt out i7, even if I were to RMA it.\n\nI should also mention that I tried RMA'ing the motherboard. I got the same behavior. Since this CPU has been working reasonably well (read: not becoming increasingly unstable) I figure it was indeed the CPUs and not the motherboard. Mostly.\n\n  \nedit: I realize I didn't answer the first question fully.\n\nRegarding temperatures, with PL1 = PL2 = 250W and ICCMax = 300A, the temperature was something under 90C for certain, even during MPrime and Linpack. I can't say much beyond that without retesting, but those power settings scare me so I'd very much rather not.",
            "Try this instead, if you have not done this yet:\n\nIn Windows, open the Settings app.\n\nChoose Apps and Select the Startup navigation option.\n\nLook for Intel Driver And Support Assistant Try.  Toggle the switch to off. \n\nLet me know if you cannot find that app still.",

We recognize that the performance on default settings may not meet your preferences; however, since you are using an unlocked processor, you have the option to modify settings to optimize your unit's performance.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are getting crashes even after changing SVID on your Asus Board to Intel Fail Safe, please contact[ Intel Customer Support](https://supporttickets.intel.com/s/?language=en_US) for a possible RMA."

        "content": "If you are using a laptop with Intel 12th generation and later processors, especially i9 processors, you can try installing [GamePP](https://www.gamepp.com/index/index/download/)(If you don't trust this Chinese software, you can use Intel XTU or HWInfo to see the throttling reason) and then play any game for a while and then exit the game to check the performance report, there is a throttling report in the upper right corner of the performance report, open it and if you see a lot of red parts and the reason for the throttling is written as \"IA: Electrical Design Point/Other\", then it is because of the current limit/PL4 power limit that caused the CPU to throttle.\n\nFirst of all, it is important to know that IA: Electrical Design Point/Other is not just about hitting the current limit, it is also about triggering the Peak Power Consumption (PL4) limit. I don't intend to talk much about current limits. Perhaps your laptop is throttling due to current limit, which might be triggered because the manufacturer intentionally locked the maximum current limit in the EC (Embedded Controller) and BIOS to restrict performance and extend the product's lifespan. In this case, flashing a modded BIOS and EC might resolve the issue. It could also be due to the laptop's insufficient power delivery units. Unless you physically add more power delivery units, the problem of frequently triggering the current limit cannot be resolved.\n\nI am planning to talk more about PL4 power limit. Before discussing PL4, it's important to understand the concept of Potential Peak Power (PPP). PPP is the theoretically highest power consumption calculated by Intel\u2018s algorithm. When the CPU starts turbo boosting, it estimates the PPP. Since PPP is an estimated value, it doesn't actually represent that much power consumption; it seems more like a prediction of the potential instantaneous power consumption of the system. When the PPP exceeds the PL4 limit, the CPU frequency is forcibly reduced to prevent \"overload\".\n\nIntel's PPP algorithm appears to have issues similar to the recent eTVB problems in desktop chips that have gone unnoticed for a long time. Even when the CPU's current power consumption is very low, like around 20-30 watts, PPP may estimate the upcoming peak power consumption to be over several hundred watts. If the estimated value exceeds the PL4 limit, then CPU will be throttled.\n\nMicro-Star International has conducted some tests, and using the 13980HX as an example, they found that only setting PL4 to at least 400 watts can prevent throttling due to EDP/Other. The suspected underlying reason is that the PPP algorithm predicts that when one core triggers turbo boost, all other cores will also reach their maximum turbo frequencies. This causes the estimated peak power consumption to become extremely high, and if this estimated value exceeds the PL4 limit, throttling occurs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u5odl193gu7d1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=58ea1e8bacce1541ab969eb40554f82e17bdfe81\n\nTranslated from Chinese by ChatGPT & DeepL, I'm not a native English speaker",

            "it might be working as intended. power delivery is not perfect, and software is giving your CPU hints/have queues that can allow you to accurately predict power overshoot. Alderlake-based cores can already use as much power as you're willing to throw at them, and it's not rare to spike 50%+ above your power target when attempting to boost quickly. \n\nPL4 is meant to a complete cutoff point, even if the cutoff is only for a 10 millisecond power spike. So you might be seeing 20~30w at the time, but the next boost ramp may demand a huge amount of power for a tiny period of time over multiple cores to hit the boost target at the latency required, making PL4 preemptively throttle to protect the chip and keep power draw stable.
