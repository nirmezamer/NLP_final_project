            "The biggest difference is that ramps don\u2019t help with wheel-off jobs. So if you\u2019re diying brakes/suspension, ramps are a luxury to get sometime after a jack and jack stands. \n\nThey\u2019re mainly useful for saving some time and being more secure for fluid changes.",
            "Ramps for everything that doesn't involve taking the wheels off, stands for everything else.",
            "I have both. \n\nThe ramps are quicker for an oil change but you need the stands to rotatate tires or change brakes, etc.\n\nSo if I had to choose one, the stands are the best. But, still, both is the way to go imo",
            "Ramps are also great for lowered cars where you can\u2019t get a jack under it easily. When I was freelancing in my driveway I used both pretty regularly",
            "I prefer ramps for anything besides wheels and suspension work. Far more stable, I get claustrophobic and shit when I use jack stands. and I can\u2019t use them where I currently live, driveway is a slope as well as the street. And I don\u2019t think O\u2019Reilly would take kindly to me, putting it on jackstands in the parking lot \ud83d\ude05",
            "Tire ramps work for some basic shit. But you can\u2019t take your wheels off with ramps. You also can\u2019t fully lift the car with ramps. \n\nJack stands let you do more. I got esco stands",
            "Jack stands I enjoy more for brake jobs, tire rotations, etc. \n\nIf you use the ramps, you really cannot do that.  They are good for oil changes.",

            "I prefer jack stands. 6 ton ones is what I use. I never trusted ramps, especially plastic ones. But that's just my opinion.",

            "Jack stands. My car is high enough for any job that would work with ramps",
            "Just get yourself a set of Harbor Freight jack stands and you'll be all set.",
            "If tires need to be off, stands, but if they don't, both. I don't trust stands, or trust ramps, so I use both. Depending on the vehicle, I'll even use a jack as well as a 3rd safety wall. Cons, limits certain areas or access to angles. Pros: If one fails, I have another. If the second fails, I have a third. If the third fails, then I guess I deserve to die.",
            "I still shutter when I think about only using a crappy little hydraulic jack as the only means of supporting a car when I was a kid. These days I use jack stands, wheel chocks, and I\u2019ll even reposition my jack not quite touching the frame as another back up. For life threatening situations, use the rule of redundancy: two is one and one is none.",
            "I work on cars for a living. I don't use ramps, *ever*. It's *always* a floor jack and jackstands. The reason: ramps like to move when you're moving a vehicle onto or off them, and when they do, they tend to move in bad (read: dangerous) ways. Plus, ramps don't offer the positional flexibility of jackstands, e.g., you can't use ramps for brake and suspension work.\n\nNow, that said, terrain may slightly favor ramps, as ramps are better on dirt than jackstands. The \"however\" for this, however, is that you really shouldn't be trying to lift a vehicle on any ground that can move or shift or that your lifting/support apparatus can sink into because a ramp or a jackstand cocking sideways is also a recipe for disaster.",
            "I don\u2019t fuck with ramps anymore, not after the pair I had failed under a friend\u2019s sedan (thankfully wasn\u2019t under it).",
            "Depends on what I\u2019m doing. Sometimes, ramps are all that are needed; other times, need those jackstands. No absolute answer here.",
            "With the risk over overshooting the ramps, or those things launching themselves into orbit when trying to drive up, I avoid them at all cost.",
            "Both",
            "I started with ramps but ended up not liking them. I was always afraid I would overshoot them and mess them up. Usually you can't do a slow roll up them and need to give it some gas. \n\nConsidering buying some ramps, jacking the car up. And placing the ramp underneath. A little more work but less stressful to me.",
            "Ramps are convenient for a quick driveway oil change.",
            "Depends. As others have said ramps are great for fluid changes and similar maintenance. Anything where you don't remove the wheel.\n\nHowever, jackstands can do everything a ramp can, and do any wheel-off repairs too.\n\nAlso, I heard you mention you can use the emergency jack. You can, but only if you also use jack stands. \nBut trust me, buy yourself a good jack. There is a 3 ton low profile jack sold as a Husky at Home Depot or as a Pittsburgh at Harbor Freight, just get whichever one is cheaper, it is 110% worth it and I wish I'd gotten one earlier. It lifts the car much higher and it's way easier to use and probably safer too.",
            "Do you think people 'lift' using jack stands?\n\nThis is a confusing wording/question for people who actually use these tools...if you're just changing oil- ramps are fine to help give clearance but never really used for lifting a vehicle to work on wheels/tires/brakes or anything like you use a jack for...but you lift with the jack and then use the stands to hold for long periods...you can't/don't use jack stands to lift.",
            "Ramps for simple fluid exchanges.  Four (4) jackstands for everything else, especially tires off.",
            "I have both. Oil changes on ramps. Wheel off jobs with jack stands. If your not needing to take the tires off, ramps are less work.",
            "Ramps when it doesn't involve the wheels or drive line.",
            "I use both depending on the job. Mostly use jack and jack stands since I rotate tires with each oil change. Ramps are way easier but you're limited with access and what you can or can't do. If you have a car which you don't rotate tires on, then ramps are a good option",
            "Quickjack is the answer. I bought one a few years ago. No turning back.",

            "I do ramps for quick oil/fluid changes and then jack stands for brakes and suspension work.",
            "Had a metal version of one of those ramps collapse while I was under a car. Barely made it out with my skin, so never again. Those plastic ones look way sketchier than the old metal versions.",
            "I use a 2 post hydraulic lift?",
            "A scissor jack \ud83d\ude02. \n\nI want the smoke",
            "I don't under stand the appeal of tire ramps, it's almost the same setup time honestly. you are maybe saving 2 minutes and you can't do tire off jobs. I'd also argue they are slightly less safe than jackstands",
            "I use Esco Jack stands. Nothing else I would trust my life with. I don\u2019t see the reason in cheaping out on Jack stands. I can fix stuff with shit tools, but nothing I know will make an unstable jack stand stable, nor a poor quality controlled steel magically turn to good steel.\n\nEsco uses a hardened steel dowel in double shear with a large base. It\u2019s bullet proof. Made in USA so they take their QC seriously cause if they don\u2019t they would get sued to the moon.",
            "You would have to be pretty damn strong to lift with those jack stands. I always need to use a jack to lift mine.",
            "Can anyone recommend good ramps for lower cars? I currently have to drive onto some wooden boards to fit a jack under the front, the jack stands sit a bit sketchy too so I'd much prefer a ramp when working under the engine.",
            "Ramos for oil/transmission/coolant changes only. Everything else goes on stands for me.",
            "I use ramps for Oil changes , coolant flushes, and transmissions fluids changes when there is a dip stick... I use 4 jack stands for brake fluid changes when sequence of bleeding is different like Subaru... when CVT/eCVT fluid changes need level ground...Differential fluid when need level ground.  and 2 jacks when working on other things...",
            "Definitely go with [car display ramps](https://mbrmarketing.com/promotional-products/vehicle-display-ramps). You don't want to cheap-out on something as important as your public image.",
            "Why pick 1. I use both simultaneously.",
            "Hi-lift and no safety measures. I like my car two feet off the ground and wobbly as all get-out.",
            "Use both. Problem solved.",
            "My 90 year old driveway has so many cracks, you have to really use care placing stands; I've put a stand on the corner of a crack and watched the crack crumble away, learned my lesson. I should really get a couple steel plates to put under the things. I do prefer a ramp if the wheels are staying on.",
            "Don't forget wheel cradles.\nI made some wheel cradles out of wood. Jack up the car and place wheels on them. Gives me more height and access than ramps when needed. \n\nOf course, a good set of 2 piece (detachable) ramps would do the same. I'm just too cheap to pay the money",
            "I recently did both at once, due to janky ramps.  Mind you, the car wasn't resting on the jack stands, and had the ramps taken a crap, it probably would have moved in such a way to make the jack stands worthless, but...\n\n...honestly there's no \"but\", that was dumb.",
            "I use the 16k Rhino ramps with medium duty delivery vehicles, and have pretty much daily for five years now.  They are awesome for oil changes, underside inspections, and the like.  I use wheel chocks behind the tires on the ground, and make sure to let the vehicle settle on the ramps before putting it in park and the parking brake on.\n\nJack stands and jack only come out if I need to unload suspension or remove tires, like doing brake jobs and the like.  Always always use jack stands.",
            "Jack stands. Half the time I'm putting a car up I need the wheels to come off anyway.",
            "jack stands because my bumper doesn\u2019t clear the ramp without a piece of wood at the bottom",
            "Wheel lifts, ramps, jacks, jack stands. All the good stuff for lifting. \nI have a bus sitting on jack stand right now. Whole thing is in the air. \nBuy quality lifting equipment. Your life depends on it. This isn\u2019t somewhere you wanna go for the sale or the cheap items. \nYou wanna get something rated for over the weight of your vehicle. \nRamps work fine but block the wheels. \nMy dad had one pop out of gear and roll back while his arm was up in the frame it twisted him like a pretzel broke his arm in 5 places. This was years ago but he\u2019s always told me to block the wheels. Make sure you\u2019re safe before crawling under.",
            "the difference is can cause serious pain and the other will save your life.",
            "save ur money on ramps. just roll it up on a tallish curb like the rest of us hillbillies do",
            "One is for mainly for easy oil changes, the other is for brakes, suspension components or other jobs that require wheels off.",
            "I use all three if I can.",
            "Jack stands for any work where you have to pull a wheel, ramps for normal maintenance. \nBe cautious. Both are becoming cheaper, constructed and less safe, made to be used much closer to their rated capacity now than they were 2 years ago even. \n\nThe set of plastic rhino ramps I have that are about 15 years old and about twice the weight of the identical model number I bought 2 weeks ago because I needed a second set to leave the truck sit on overnight while I was changing the clutch.\n\nThe old ones I could leave my pickup sitting on overnight and there was no evidence that anything had even driven on them. The new ones have significantly deformed in shape from the same truck sitting on them for about 3 hours. \nSame plastic ramps same model number. Same manufacturer both made in China but in comparison the new ones are garbage strength wise.",
            "not a mechanic but I use ramps for oil changes, jack and stands for anything that's wheels off.\n\nI try to use ramps when I can, since i'm working on a gravel driveway and a floor jack is kinda sketchy on gravel where it cannot move.",
            "Usually with my back\u2026",
            "Ramps anytime I can, it\u2019s so much easier and quicker, it\u2019s a little scary when you start using them as to not roll off the front, but once you get used to it, it\u2019s no problem. I still use chicks and jack stands with ramps too.",
            "1.oilchange helpers and you have to drive up. Helps with oilchange. \n\n2.security so you can get home to family after tinkering with whatever you have to have tinkered at the moment.",
            "You really need a spotter to get the car on the ramps properly. Sure you can do it by yourself but you run a much higher risk of overshooting and coming off the ramps. \n\nJack stands you can easily do by yourself no issues.",
            "Why not both ?? Ramps to lift the car and the stands to hold the car up??",
            "You have to use both for different jobs. I use both at the same time for jobs that require the entire car in the air.\n\nWheel-off jobs, ramps aren't going to help, unless you're using the ramps to save time jacking, then you just have to lift the car off of the ramps a bit and use a jack stand and you're good, that is, if your jack goes that high.",
            "Ramps for wheel on, jack and stands for wheel off.\n\nLift = GOAT though.",
            "I have the jack. I wish I have the ramps.",
            "Apples and oranges.  Depends on the job.\n\nIf you need to take off the tires, for example brake jobs, you need a jack/jack stands.  If doing stuff like oil changes, ramps are fine.",
            "I\u2019m using both right now. I\u2019m pulling the rear end out of my car so the front is on ramps and the back is being held up by stands so I can slide my fat ass under the car. Ironic that I have a huge garage but no money for a lift. Or a thick enough pad for a 2 post.",
            "if I\u2019m need to lift the whole vehicle I just use both, drive up on ramps, lift from the back or front",
            "Not a mechanic, but do work here and there on our personal vehicles. If the job can be done with ramps, I'll use ramps. Feels safer to me and easier to set up. One of my cars is quite low and I just drive up on some blocks of wood first.\n\nIf I need additional height or if the wheels need to come off, especially for a prolonged period of time, I'll use the jack stands. If I just need to pop one wheel off for something real quick and don't need to go under the car, I'll floor jack one end up and leave it on the jack and slide either a wheel or ramp under the jack point where the it'd normally rest on a jack stand for safety. The minimum height on the jack stands I have currently is higher than I really need, causing me to have to jack the car up higher than I'd prefer to, so I only use them when I have to. Shorter ones would be nice especially for cars that are low.",
            "It depends on what I\u2019m doing. If it requires pulling wheels off, jack + stands. If it doesn\u2019t, ramps.",
            "I don't even see these as having the same purpose most of the time. The ramps are good for low cars to get a jack under, but rarely make anything high enough to do real work underneath. They're nice for getting a bumper off a car and not having to roll around on the ground as much though.",
            "Both. My car is low so I need the ramps just to jack it up",
            "I hate the ramps. They are unnecessarily annoying",

            "I can get under my truck without jacking it up so I only have a nice jack for when I pull wheels off",
            "Never buy more than one tool that can do multiple jobs. I'll never have a need for a ramp to clutter my garage",
            "When on gravel then ramps for oil changes or exhaust work. Otherwise jack stands if im not at the garage where i have a lift\u2026",
            "I think the ramps are kinda pointless. There are very few jobs where the wheels don\u2019t come off for whatever reason. Just easier to just always use a jack and jack stand.",
            "I used Pro-Lift jacks similar to the ones on the right and got really tired of jacking the car up...so for Christmas 2 years ago I get some Quick Jacks. I added some roller wheels to em (the two they give you suck balls) and it's SO easy to lift my '11 M56x and '16 QX60.",

            "You need jack stands and a floor jack if you plan to actually work on your car, if I'm doing an oil change I use the ramp to make it nice and quick, but anytime I have to do an actual repair I lift the entire vehicle up to get me as much room as I can have",
            "I\u2019ve got a low profile rapid lift jack and axle stands.",
            "Seen guys use something called a tilt lift at the track. Keeps 2 of the wheels on the ground most of the time, operated by a drill. Saw someone change a clutch on a 911 using one",

            "I always preferred to go cut some nice thick sections of the right height from a good wood tree. (think Oak as an example, and think very large diameter so you maintain a height-to-width relationship of not more than about 1.5 to 1).   It is both that I an exceptionally paranoid and that I often worked under bull dozers.  Have have seen pretty substantial jack stands flattened.",

        "content": "I have a 2005 Corolla. I (regretfully) agreed to have sway bar links replaced at a local Midas. Later in the week (unrelated), I took it to a Jiffy Lube for coolant issues and asked to check the brakes too. The Jiffy Lube guy noticed that these bolts were loose and could not be tightened. He recommended that I report the Midas work bc the car is in \"dangerous\" condition.\n\nObviously, this was alarming to me. Car seems to drive fine but I keep worrying the front end might collapse or fall off. Finally get the Corolla back to Midas and they say it's not that serious and that, to tighten the bolts, they would have to make holes in the frame. Nobody seems to know what the bolts do exactly but ofc they're there for a reason. Couldn't find any specs on Google so now I'm hoping you Redditors can help. \n\nIs this really dangerous? What should I do? I have about 2 weeks to decide whether to make Midas warranty their work. Jiffy Lube guy thinks I should have them buy and replace the whole subframe. I honestly feel lucky that I got away with a car intact the first time (turns out Midas messed up my brakes when they did the sway bar). Do I really want to press the Midas for free work that might open an even bigger can of worms for this old car? Or if they end up cutting holes to fix the bolts, would that create other problems I'd want to avoid?\n\nNot sure which sub to post this in, so I'm trying a few. Ideally I can continue driving the Corolla for another year, at least (as I pay off the sway bar work in installments). The car is very reliable otherwise with great pick up. Thanks in advance for your comments and advice.  ",

            "Those bolts are holding the subframe to the unibody structure of the car, so yeah, kinda dangerous. But also, these bolts shouldn\u2019t have been touched and have nothing to do with replacing sway bar end links. Did they possibly replace the sway bar itself?",
            "Go. Back. To. Midas.\n\nSombody fucked up and thought it would be overlooked long enough for it not to be linked back to them. If they say it was like that before, then they 100% would/ should have told you about it",
            "Doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re stripped. Looks like the nut they thread into which is usually spotwelded inside the frame or whatever has broken apart when they undid them for whatever reason, causing it to be loose and not able to tighten up, the whole thing just spins.",
            "So after doing some digging, I think your bolt size is M16x1.5. Not 100% on the pitch, but it\u2019s a 19mm socket = m16 bolt. Other models with compatible also use m16\u2019s on the subframe, and those are 1.5 pitch. \n\nAre you sure they just replaced the links and not the bar as well? Removing the bar would cause the mechanic to loosen those bolts. From what I\u2019ve seen, this is a fairly common issue. Toyota used a threaded sleeve instead of a nut, and it\u2019s apparently pretty easy to strip/gall the threads when using a pneumatic/electric gun.\n\nAs far as safety, there are probably worse cars on the road. It is still not great. Looking at it, there\u2019s 4 bolts holding your front suspension and front half on your powertrain to the car, and you\u2019re rolling around without 2 of them. Depending the condition of the two bolts you have left, a big pothole could be a very bad day for you. I would go back to Midas as soon as possible, and try to sort things out.",
            "Here's another picture of the bolt placement:\u00a0[https://imgur.com/a/Jwth7Il](https://imgur.com/a/Jwth7Il)\n\nBoth sides are loose",
            "Everyone is saying go back to midas. But i dont see a reason they would have touched those bolts, incidentally or otherwise. The sway bar link procedure for sure doesn\u2019t call for dropping the subframe so not sure how you could prove they caused it",

Started my test drive and something felt a bit off but not brutal dangerous.  Notice a heavy clunk under acceleration, gave it a bit more and out of nowhere I am over the curb onto the sidewalk.  Would have hit someone for sure if they were there.  Brought it back to the shop and found the front sub frame completely loose.

            "Here on the coast that is near mint condition my boy",
            "That\u2019s pretty normal, just surface rust. In 20 years maybe it will become a problem",

            "Looks close to my old 03 4runner from Chicago.",
            "Doesn\u2019t hurt to change it sooner so I say go for it. Does the drain plug have a copper/aluminium crush washer? Make sure you change that with a new one. Doesn\u2019t need to go very tight, can\u2019t tell you a torque spec tho",
            "You don't gotta change the difference fluid. It usually lasts 200k and when you tighten it it needs to be done with an impact",
            "This is why I live in Colorado.",
            "Been there, you from south of the rust belt? Up here in the north I cut the spare tire cross member out of a trailblazer about 6 months ago. Surprisingly It stayed on the road till about May. He would have drove it longer if he didn't hit a deer and drive it for another 20 miles. Funny part was it just needed a head gasket.",
            "If you live somewhere they use salt when it snows, get it undercoated with fluid film yearly just before winter starts. Don\u2019t get any of the rubberised coatings, they can cause more damage than nothing",
            "My '21 ford is way worse than that already \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f that's extremely normal pretty much anywhere in the northwest \u00bc of America.",
            "Ok thanks alot bro",
            "Should still be OK without torque or should I probably get one?",
            "Once it starts to resist you, thats the washer getting crushed as it should. Torque it till it gets to that point and then 1/8 of a turn (or a quarter of a quarter if that gives you a better visual).",
            "Pleaaaaaase don't tighten it with an impact wrench, OP!",
            "Lol",
            "Have you ever changed oil and know roughly how tight the drain plug goes? Similar to that. Like the other commenter said, Do it by hand all the way, and then with your ratchet/wrench go about 1/8 turn after it gets tight.",
            "You can rent one from autozone/oreillys for free which is nice",
            "Half of a quarter. Quarter of a quarter is is 1/16.",
            "Exactly what I was thinking was reading others on older ones said drain and fill were different but can't find any info on that.. thanks for the advice!",
            "Gotta figure out the torque or go snug",
            "What he said! If I were good at math I'd be an engineer \ud83e\udd23 sorry"

It might change sound if you pull out the dipstick as well. If it ends up being the Pcv you replace the valve cover. Easy to do. There is another one in your intake manifold, which is the reason the valve cover Pcv fails. Again got to replace the whole manifold. It's pretty easy to do. I had a Cruze 1.4 and this would happen often. They make a bypass kit for the engine if you Google for it, chevy 1.4 Pcv bypass. Another failure point is the plastic coolant outlet. There is an aluminum one available if you Google for it. That outlet is what killed my Cruze. It busted 4 times on me on the highway, resulting in overheating.

Turbo no longer spun, sensors went offline and had to drive with a scanner plugged in.\n\nIn that time, the pcv fix worked for five minutes, after that the clicking came back, and was the same loudness as before within 50 miles. So pcv ticking is there for good.\n\nInjectors we\u2019re also somewhat loud on mine, could be those as well. \n\nWhile you have the spark plugs out like others mentioned, could check the piston tops for possible cavitations, if you do actually have a knock issue.",
