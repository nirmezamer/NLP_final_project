        "content": "Hello friends,\n\nThere has been a particularly nasty influx of repost spam bots and we\u2019re asking for your help to send them back into the void. \n\nIf a post seems a bit off, you\u2019re just _certain_ you have seen that post at the top of Wholesome Memes before, maybe the post seems oddly out of place like it was made by a lost Redditor or otherwise definitely isn\u2019t a meme yet alone a wholesome one, or the top comments all seem to be by accounts with some pretty obvious patterns, **please report them!**\n\nReporting is the fastest and most effective way to get them into not only our queue, but malicious bot spam reports will help ensure admins can get eyes on them, too, at an account level.\n\nWe are working diligently to swat them down as they pop up, but as we\u2019re all volunteers who do this as we can when we can, there will always be periods in which we cannot have eyes on every single post and comment. Reports by our amazing community do a great job of helping us make sure the bots get handled as quickly as we can and it is always appreciated knowing others are passionate about taking out a bit of garbage in order to keep this place tidy and nice.\n\nWe are also looking at a few different ways to help identify malicious reposting and karma farming bots and bot-like accounts sooner and more effectively so rest assured we\u2019re aware of the issue and are seeking the best options for handling it.\n\nOn a definitely, totally unrelated note, mod apps may be coming pretty soon too. \n\nIn the meantime, thank you to all of you who have already been so helpful in that regard and for everyone reading this we hope you have an especially lovely day.",

            "This is always so dumb to me. I'm a devout Christian, and in the Bible God literally sends ravens to feed Elijah. The Christian God...  where there is blatant conflict between Satan and God, God, rather than Satan, sends so labelled \" evil \" birds to feed His people. How do they get evil from this? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14",

            "I heard the reason that that is is because in older times (like in crusades) ravens would show up because they knew that their would be a tasty snack",
            "Crows are symbols of death because they eat corpses. Not because they are black. So they show up after a big battle or plague or whatever.",

            "Still love crows though they are so metal ! Ca-caw, CAW!",
