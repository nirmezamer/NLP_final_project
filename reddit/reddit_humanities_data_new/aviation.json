It is a helicopter essentially.

            "No one\u2019s saying we need to pillory the pilots, but we also shouldn\u2019t just dismiss/brush off what could have been a fatal mistake. At my home airport of SJC being at 500ft 9nm out could easily put you into the side of the Santa Cruz mountains. All people are saying is we should figure out what happened and correct it.\n\nYour dismissiveness is very much against a safety first culture, so I\u2019d hate to fly with you",
            "Woooosh",
            "Lol who said I represent Boeing? Wtf dude you seriously have no clue what you are even talking about. It\u2019s not common at all. Go to an airport and ask every pilot you see if it\u2019s common and they will all say no! Simple as that.",
            "This kind of thing is almost a catastrophic accident, so your sentiment is unwarranted.\u00a0",
            "Yeah I figured That\u2019s because you have exactly no past incidents at all that prove that it\u2019s very common.",
            "Are you a pilot?",
            "It\u2019s the *second* sentence too. He couldn\u2019t make it past the headline and a single sentence.",
            "They\u2019ll pull parts off it until it\u2019s light enough to take off",
            "\u201cWe\u201d should absolutely dismiss it. Because \u201cwe\u201d here on reddit can\u2019t do jack shit about it. SWA has access to the real FOQA and CVR data, they can handle it. You on the other hand have access to foreflight and news/media. There isn\u2019t a lot you can do with that.",
            "Actually I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t represent Boeing. But it is funny how you made their logo your avatar. I just pointed it out because you\u2019re either a kid playing a game, or like I said you ought to know how the system works.",
            "Kinda reminds me how people say \u201cI almost died today.\u201d Everything is alive, don\u2019t worry.",
            "Accountability comes from everyone my dude, else you just normalize near misses until they become accidents",
            "What the fuck does my profile picture have to do with anything. What the fuck? Lmao like how\u2019s that even funny? You must realize that you were wrong about your original point though that\u2019s the only explanation for you changing the conversation the way you did by bringing up my Reddit name and profile picture for some weird ass reason. Lol",
            "If you almost died then it\u2019s definitely worth going into exhaustive detail what you did wrong to almost die. You don\u2019t think you should ever have to answer any questions about that?\n\nI hope you\u2019re not a pilot. Because your attitude toward dangerous mistakes is not something a pilot should have. Mistakes get talked about. **In detail**. That\u2019s why the safety record is what it is. Theres no such thing as \u201cnobody died. Let it go.\u201d",
            "I guess tike to boycott SWA? Complain doesn\u2019t change shit, spending your money differently does. Don\u2019t know what else to tell you.",
            "Damn lol, you get offended easily. Relax buddy. All is well.",
            "I\u2019m tired to having the same damn conversation with every one of you. Go read my other posts on this topic.",
            "Well I already do so yeah \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
            "Lol yeah so offended right. I don\u2019t think you know what the word offended means lmao. Btw your first comment is up to 45 downvotes lmao. I sincerely hope you aren\u2019t a pilot. If you are you probably land at the wrong airport all the time and than tell yourself it\u2019s normal afterwards lmao"

Obviously TWA as such failed in a deregulated aviation market and despite a well established brand just like Pan Am both had no chance of survival, also as Germany was unified and flights from and to Berlin no longer an advantage or niche.",
