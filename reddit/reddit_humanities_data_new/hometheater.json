Not enough to justify a $4k cable over the $20 version, but there was some genuine benefit in the resulting quality. It was a rip off, but not an outright scam\n\nWith digital cables, though, the benefit is minimal and very situational. HDMI either works or it doesn\u2019t, for the most part - so a $4k cable and $20 cable are doing the EXACT same job with the EXACT same results\n\nThere are a few edge cases over very long runs where a higher quality cable and connectors could mean the expensive cable works when the cheap one would not or could glitch, but it\u2019s vanishingly rare to be in that small window where it would be relevant and even then, really not worth $4k (a $50 repeater will do the same thing\u2026)\n\nBut the companies know some idiot will buy it and thus they keep making \u201csuper premium\u201d cables",

            "Maybe supposed to be $44.95? That's still pricey to me lol, but then again I buy monoprice and it's never done me wrong. \n\nWhat you have to remember is, analog cables back in the day were affected a great deal more with interference from other cables, longer runs, unshielded or untwisted, etc. so much caused a bad signal even over 6-10ft. Even being zinc, nickel, tin, aluminum or gold all came into play. \n\nSo Monster cables, I remember buying a shielded, twisted, nylon braided sheathing set of component video cables for $40 which was a lot in the early 00s, and I used those up until I finally got rid of my HK DVD player in 2015 or so. I still have them just not used. But I never had a signal quality issue or interference.\n\nI digress... So back to digital... Pretty simply put, digital, you either have signal or you don't. There's not any real static, fuzz, or \"noise\" like you used to get. But audioquest is banking on you not knowing any better. *IF* you have a bad cable, you *might* get artifacting or black flickers/\"loss of signal\" for a second or two.\n\nI only know bc back when I bought HDMI cables on eBay rated for 1.2a I believe (tested to that standard anyway). I finally had issues when still using those cables on my Xbox One X. If I tried to run 4K resolution on Forza 7, occasionally, every 30 seconds I'd have the screen go out. Sort of like maxing out your bandwidth, this cable couldn't handle it and once bottlenecked, would drop video until it \"refreshed\" and came back on. Anyway, my point is the cables nowadays could be tested only to a certain standard, but that doesn't mean they can't go beyond (no new standard yet). I certainly got my use out of those since I was a huge 3D TV fan and my cables worked just fine. Even 4K at 30Hz for 1.4a was fine. But I think the higher frame rate mixed with HDR was too much.",

Should I mark the price up a reasonable amount and sell a bunch of them, or should I jack the price up like crazy and only sell a few?  Most of the time, I'd only have a few items to sell so I didn't have to worry about moving thousands of them.  I had to move 4.  Finding 4 people who have the money and desire for really rare and high-end stuff is a lot easier than you'd think \n\nI'd imagine these cables are the same way.  They know they'll never sell a bunch of those.  There just aren't that many people out there who would ever pay that much for a cable.  The thing is, they don't care.  At that price and that markup, you don't need to see that many to make a whole lot of money.  You can go buy a decent BMW if you sell 20.

And the best part, it can build up over time.\u00a0\n\n\nSay you have a projector room and have seen the sparkle issue, you bring out an AV tech to diagnose the issue. He's there 30 minutes \"everything is fine you're crazy\" charges $500 and leaves.\u00a0\n\n\n1 hour later the sparkles return!\u00a0\n\n\nWhile HDMI is digital and using 1s and 0s, that's a gross oversimplification of what's happening in the cable. The main data lines actually sending the video data use multiple twisted pairs with data broken out into chunks based on RGB colour space and a clock signal that's used to recombine them at the far end.\u00a0\n\n\nIf one of those twisted pairs has a slight issue the signals can't be recombined properly and you get the sparkles.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever the display or projector will have error correcting working overtime to fix incoming signal. In my experience with just the right level of errors, it will keep the sparkles at bay for a good chunk of time before it overheats and can't handle the sheer number of errors and then bam, sparkles everywhere.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDon't forget there are other pins (19 in total) that can be as important as the raw data pins. Think hot plug detection not working (why do I have to fully restart my tv before I get a signal??) or the ones used for CEC. The worst can be the EDID malfunctioning and many consumer devices not allowing you to manually specify a resolution leaving that Blu ray player stuck outputting 1080p to your new 4k display (you'd be amazed how many people don't even notice.)",
