They don\u2019t exist in Asia.\n\nOn top of that, it wasn\u2019t until the 1847 that the existence of Gorillas was widely accepted by people outside of Africa in Europe and Asia. American physician and missionary Thomas Staughton Savage and naturalist Jeffries Wyman first described the western gorilla in 1847 from specimens obtained in Liberia. Prior to that, Gorillas were considered almost legendary creatures like Bigfoot by Europeans, only heard of in stories though of course Africans themselves knew they exist.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla\n\nBasically, Gorillas don\u2019t exist in Asian culture so how can they be used in traditional Chinese medicine?\n\nYou know who uses Gorilla body parts in medicine? \n\nTraditional African medicine!!\n\nIn addition to using their body parts for medicine, Africans are also using them as magical charms and hunting their meat for bushmeat.\n\nYou can read about the United Nations report on the threat to Gorilla conservation here:\n\nhttps://www.cms.int/gorilla/es/node/4398\n\nThat is the reason why Africans themselves are poaching Gorillas. Combine that with habitat loss due to human development encroaching on their lands and western hunters hunting them and now you know why Gorillas are endangered.\n\nIt has nothing to do with Asia at all.\n\nBut that is not going stop you from being racist towards Asians, is it?\n\nAnd look how many upvotes you got for spouting racist bullshit?\n\nFuck you, Fuzzy-Numbers, and fuck everyone who upvotes you.",

The less time/space they give to each animal, the more animals they can have and the more money they can make. It honestly isn't more complex than that. Every single farmer every single year is trying their hardest to make a way bigger profit than last year. \n\nIt would be literally impossible (I'll concede lab grown mean may work) to tackle animal cruelty from a demand perspective. There will always be a demand. But you can influence the supply. Once supply is lower, even the meatiest mean eatin' carnivore American couldn't stop the food culture from changing (different recipes becoming popular, substitutions are found, it could even spur more funding into the lab grown meat I mentioned). Which would reduce demand a little. The farm industry grew demand by influencing culture with mega popular/false advertising campaigns for the past 70 years so it's demonstrably possible to change it back. (Also by \"being too big to fail\" in the case of cow farming -- the government would rather have cheese caves than actually let those fucks lose a profit; excess product, excess profit, and the government just keeps saying \"yeah go ahead and stuff more cows in there! get your bag king!\").\n\nIf I'm brutally honest: you're wasting your energy doing anything but trying to get the corporations or government to change. I realize that is significantly more difficult than targeting individuals and thus you will understandably ignore this and continue to target individuals purely out of a desire to feel like you're doing *something*.
