        "content": "Hi r/developersIndia,\n\nI'm Sathyajith Bhat, but most call me Sathya (or SathyaBhat).\n\nI currently work as a Staff Software Engineer at The Trade Desk in Sydney, Australia. I was born and completed my education from the small city of Mangalore, Karnataka. I started tinkering with computers back in 1997 when my dad purchased my first computer featuring a blazing-fast Pentium 100 MHz Processor, a whopping 16MB of RAM and a 1GB hard disk.\n\nAs with most folks, I completed my grudation as an Electronics Engineer (because it had more \"scope\") and got my first job at 3i Infotech Ltd, a former subsidiary of ICICI Bank via off-campus interview (because my overall GPA low enough that I couldn't sit in placements). In my first job, I worked as a release engineer, preparing release/patch notes (back then CI/CD etc weren't a thing). I picked up a knack for finding out the root cause of problems and weird bugs, a challenge that I enjoyed very much leading to my eventual transition to DevOps with StyleTag back in 2015 and then to SRE at Adobe in 2017. Over my 17 years of experience, I've worked in a variety of roles from development, manual testing, client liaison, and of late SRE.\n\nIn my free time, I used to spend a lot of time working with different communities, organizing events and meetups such as AWS Community Day, CDK Day, and Barcamp Bangalore. I was one of the early private beta user of Stack Overflow, and eventually became a Community Moderator at [Super User](https://superuser.com). For my contributions to the AWS Community, I'm recognized as an [AWS Container Hero](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/sathyajith-bhat/).\n\nI'm also an author, having written two editions of Practical Docker with Python and a co-author of The CDK Book. In my free time, I play a lot of games (usually ARPGs) and have some [minor sideprojects](https://github.com/sathyabhat). I used to blog quite a bit but has reduced a lot but you can follow my blogs:\n\n* Tech blog at https://sathyasays.com\n* Personal blog at https://sathyabh.at\n\nFor a detailed  write up of my career you can read this you can read this interview transcript on SRE Stories - https://www.srestories.dev/p/sre-story-with-sathya-bhat.\n\nHere's [my post on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sathyabhat_devops-sre-cloud-activity-7209924423817076737-bw-6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) to verify my handle.\n\n\ud83d\udcac Ask me about AWS, Cloud Computing, Containers, DevOps, Technical Writing or anything else - I will try my best to answer.\n\n----\n\nOk I'm going to take a break for the day as it's getting late and dinner time. Thanks for having me, and if there's some questions I haven't answered, I will reply tomorrow. You can reach me on Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord or email - I will try my best to answer. Contact details are at https://sathyabh.at/about/\n\nThank you everyone!\n\n",

I finished my graduation in 2023 Jun and it has been 1 year and I have done nothing but hop from one interest to another like Animation, Video Editing, Game development and now settled down on DevOps. I am preparing for certifications. My CV is as empty as white paper. I don't even know what to answer if an interviewer asks me to introduce myself.

Current tech stack is C++, Python, AWS, Docker and a little of ReactJS. \n\nI keep seeing many posts /  online articles stating that semiconductor industry is going to boom in India.

Is there any topic in those fields worth researching, so that I can have an awesome research paper.",
            "Hi Sathyajith! \nA 3rd year college student here. I've generally heard people on the internet saying that there is saturation in the market nowadays and how there is lack of good software engineers.

I am able to answer interviews with topics related to all these, but most of the time they rejected me because of lack of coding. My question is let's say I have learned k8s, I have an idea what questions I should expect (k8s storage, networking ,fundamentals , use case ), but how should I prepare for coding round with respect to devops . I have learnt coding but I am not a developer , so every time a company asks me to write any logic related to python and I fail.

I'm unsure about the future of SRE or maybe I'm unaware.

            "> you've worked in bengaluru, romania, and are now in australia. how easy or difficult have you found settling into different regional cultures.\n\nIt takes a while to get used to regional cultures but it's a learning experience. Australia is pretty easy going as there are people from many different countries and is quite multi-cultural. \n\nRomania is far more mono-cultural and people are a lot more blunt - that can be misconstrued as them being rude, esepcially if you're listening to them just on audio.",
            "> the most critical skills aspiring developers should focus on to stay relevant in the rapidly evolving tech industry?\n\nI think having a really good grasp on fundamentals goes a long way in understanding and adapting to new technology. With that you also need to keep up with what's up and coming  being part of meetups, conferences, reading blogs, Reddit/Hacker News goes a long way in helping bridge this gap\n\n> Also, how do you balance the technical depth needed for development with the creative aspects of writing and content creation?\n\nYou need to understand your audience - are you doing for beginners, or intermediate/advanced folks? Quite so happens that a lot of content is targetted at beginners because they're the ones who're searching for it the most. The more intermediate/advanced your content goes, the smaller is the target audience. And if you can make peace with that, then you try to go for what you like the most - teach new folks, or go into incredibly deep dives that you will not get much of a response :)",

From this, here's what I think you should do: \n* learn a programming language. Any will do, python is good to start. You need to know enough to write small scripts, not just hello world\n* learn to live in terminal: practice how to create files/directories, understand unix permission model (if I ask what does 644 or rwx-w--w- means you should be able to tell me)\n* shell scripting is good to have\n* learn about managing servers: how to install an OS, how to install software (pick any distro, I would recommend Ubuntu. Others the commands will differ, the principles will be the same)\n* learn about how build, run software. Pick any open source software, or build your own, and learn how to package it to deploy. Write small shell scripts to make the 5 things you have to do always in to a script executable script\n* learn about containers (\"docker\" is a tool, containers is the principle). Learn how to package this app you built into a container\n* learn about CI/CD principles. Understand the principles. Tools like Jenkins/Gitlab/Github actions will come naturally. Practice how to build your app using CI principles. Then practice how to deploy them using CD.\n* Understand how networking works. You don't have to go deep into the kernel level. At the minimum, you need to know about Subnets, routing, interfaces, ports\n* Understand OS concepts: understand the Linux folder hierarchy. if someone asks you where the logs are, or how to get a app to run on startup, you should be able to explain these \n* If you're going to pick up Cloud Skills: pick a Cloud,  any cloud. Principle matters, implementation will come from reading the docs\n* Understand fundamental pillars of cloud: IAM, Virtual networking\n* build something in the cloud. Maybe a manually deploy that app you built onto a cloud VM\n* learn some infra as code to automatically do these.",

Career trajectories depend on a lot of factors - whether you like the job, whether you're supported by your managers, what kind of work you get etc. \n\nYou can have all the plans in the world for the most ideal career and have them messed up due to something you can't control.\n\nHaving said that, I think its fair to say - try to stay in for atleast couple of years to get a good hold on what the role entitles, and then switch later, staying for longer as you get more experienced",

Keep writing a rough outline of what you want to write. \n2. Keep updating the post with the notes whenever you can, of whatever you did.\n3. Try to keep a dedicated time to go through these, refine it and publish it. \n\nI have been publishing my weekly notes on my personal blog since about a year and half now, and I usually write the posts on Sunday afternoon and now it's become a habit.",

            "> Please elaborate on \"network actively\". How exactly should I?\n\nThere's different ways of networking - the more common would be to start showing up at meetups. As you attend more, some people will become more familiar as they are repeat folks. Talk to them, find out what they are doing. \n\nFor online communities, hanging around in telegram/slack groups interact with people, answer their questions, ask questions and become familiar among people.\n\n> Like should I help them with their family matter and all?\n\nNot at all. \n\n> What will I achieve irl if I know many people and many people know me?\n\nit opens up connections - my move to DevOps was possible because a friend who I met at a conference told his friend that I'm looking for a change. My current job is via another firend who I met online, and asked me if I am interested in the job. \n\nThe world is small and knowing people IRL can be the difference between \"I have seen the person online\" vs \"I've seen the person at x, y, z meetups and they are interested in x technology and seems like an interesting person\".",
            "> How are the career prospects for Devops compared to SDE?\n\nDevOps is still quite a broad and nascent field, so you can expect it have lots opportunites. My take is that DevOps is still a specialized field/role and you should focus on building your career as an SDE, especially given that you like it more. Folks with SDE backgrounds are quite in demand, especially in platform engineering and in SRE, and prior dev knowledge in SRE/DevOps can be invaluable.",
            "> Will DevOps focus primarily on existing infrastructure maintenance, potentially hindering innovation?\n\nIdeally, DevOps should be a philosophy, but that ship has sailed so far long now, it's kinda sad. There's no need that DevOps should focus on existing infra maintenance - the focus should be about breaking barriers and improving performance of teams by removing bottlenecks. \n\n> To navigate the next decade DevOps or operational roles , what skillsets do you consider essential?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, a decade is a long time in tech. I'd consider debugging/problem solving and trying to understand the business problem that a tech solution aims to fix as some of the essential skillsets for good DevOps/SRE",

            "> but hop from one interest to another \n\nMy suggest is to find a niche and stick to it. Keep building stuff.

Ignore the part about certification, do everything end to end. \n\n> I don't even know what to answer if an interviewer asks me to introduce myself.\n\nWell, you can say what you said - you were trying out different things and finally stuck to x because of y reasons.

        "content": "So I had a really bad interview experience... it was a walk-in interview and other candidates were there too. They were coming out in like 10 minutes and said they got asked easy stuff about their core skills and tech stack or whatever was on their resume. So I thought, 'Cool, this will be easy.'\n\nBut when it was my turn, there were two guys, and one asked for my resume. I accidentally handed him two because I panicked, and he said, 'Did I ask for two?' It was so rude, and from then on he seemed annoyed. I could tell from his face that I was in trouble.\n\nThis guy asked me WAY TOO MUCH in detail... too many niche topics. I'd say out of 30 questions I knew like 22. Then he made me solve three LeetCode medium questions on paper. I solved them because I knew those as I had already solved them before. But then he told me to write a whole machine learning code from preprocessing, to make a model and plot a graph - really deep stuff, ALL ON PAPER. I messed up there because he only gave me like 5-10 minutes for something that would've taken at least 20 or more.\n\nHe asked so much that I was like, 'Is this Google?' It didn't feel like an entry-level interview. While I was writing code, these guys were saying stuff to each other like, 'He doesn't know what he's doing' and 'It's wrong.' I admit I'm new to machine learning and I messed up a few syntaxes because Python is not great, and it was hard to focus on writing code when they were constantly criticizing. I don't know why they were only upset with me.\n\nAfter 40 minutes, they told me to wait for the HR round. In the HR round, the HR person was just talking and asking others questions, but in mine, the annoyed guy came and teamed up with HR to lecture me about small stuff that doesn't even matter.\n\nThis was my first ever tech interview and I'm really discouraged. They also asked a lot of stuff like 'How is this your first interview? Your college doesn't have placements?' I'm from a tier 3 college and you know how bad the market is. The only companies that came to my college were some digital marketing and no tech-related ones, so I never got a chance to interview before. Off-campus, it's really hard to stand out from the crowd.\n\nWhatever it was, it showed me I need to work on myself a lot, but I'm kind of sad because this company was my top priority and I messed up. It will be hard to get an opportunity like this because as a fresher it's hard to even get shortlisted. But at least now I know how much I fumble under stress and panic and have to work on that a lot",

Some of the ECE/CSE folk did MS from US universities and I see them working in similar roles in similar companies (FAANG) vis-a-vis the ones who stayed in India, difference obviously is that one set earns in USD while other set earns in INR.\n\nI did MBA from a college that you would know as an IIM and as I look back, it still looks sense for me to have done that - because I was in a low growth, low salary paying core job in a well known company prior to that.\n\nPeople who did CSE/IT from Tier 2/3 colleges and upskilled well while being in Tech have managed to reach similar monetary outcomes as folks from IIMs - I know such cases personally.\n\nSimple way to look at things - Geography+Industry>>Individual. There's nothing much you can do as an individual to overcome the impact of being in a high growth industry or high growth company. So, do not only work hard, also optimise that hard work to be in the right companies. Industry wise, you are already in the right place being in Tech. The job market is increasingly becoming like the stock market I guess!\n\nI would advise you to do some learning around Data Science and Machine Learning as well if you find interest in that field. And it is not only about Python - it is also about understanding the Maths and Stats that work under the hood. Else, DS could have been as easy as importing a package and using it. \n\nIn the overall Data and Analytics space, demand for Data Engineers will be higher in number than Data Analyst/Scientist simply because of the reason that Data Engineers help in building the foundation of a building in which Data Science and Analytics work can be done thereafter.",

So creative jobs are gonna be fked in next 5 to 10 years completely.\n\nNew jobs for making and training AI are going to come-Making them more efficient.\n\nSo freshers will slowly become unfavorable candidates for job and those with actual knowledges and management skills will be Hired.   \n\n\nEven people with research level will earn good at this. Talented people and Skilled people to stay and bootcamp people and sake of doing people will slowing be left behind.",

Unlike a BTech degree from a top college, the outcome in a b school has strong linkage with the profile and CV a person has before joining the IIM."

Have been working in the current company for last 4 years.\n\n>If you're interviewing backend devs and the reason for not asking DSA is because it is not used frequently, you shouldn't ask OS / networking as well\n\nI did mention I ask DSA but not the extreme hard kind.\n\n>Ask questions like multi threading, internals of SQL and nosql db, give them a scenario which involves using a design pattern and see if they can figure it out, if they're experienced ask them how will they handle the same at large scale, if they can figure out which part of the flow can be done in async fashion using MQs etc.\n\nI generally do this but a bit more easier questions. Here is the full pattern:\n\n1. Simple/Medium DSA\n2. Some theory(OS, Network, DB etc)  from core which is used in daily life or has relation to what we use, Like i will ask whats a mutex then if they have coded in python ask GIL next and see if they correlate the two.\n3. Some LLD - Ask them to design me an abstract car/house etc  api  and walk through the components.\n4. Some questions to check their daily utility skills if they aware of basic skills like using linux command line , database skills on the ones they have listed or we have asked in job profile,  git command etc.\n5. I rarely ask HLD because i am not going to allow any freshers hands on them, when i think they are ready I will start preparing them by giving some tasks related. If they have mentioned it explicitly in resume then I will ask some question to check if it is true or not.\n6. If they are little experience I will ask them some debugging scenario and ask them to walk me through the process they follow in their current work place.\n\nThe company I work generally pays 5-10 L for freshers and the guys I have recruited are very productive and I have low attrition rate in my team. Few guys who have jumped ships have easily made 50-200%  easily when they wanted to after couple of years with my team. I see that my process is working and I am able to filter and select effectively !!",

I see that my process is working and I am able to filter and select effectively !!\n\nThis is not a relevant metric lol. Once you join a company, what was asked in an interview is not at all relevant. If an employee works hard and grows his skills, he will realise that he can earn more and if he doesn't get a hike that meets his expectations, he'll switch.",
            "what was the compensation offered for those roles?",

            "Dude its already taught in college and it is more relevant to job than you think(at least that is what my experience tells me),  other wise we would have just asked people to read DSA and not go through four years of engineering.    \n  \nI think you have very very strong opinion on this and it is pointless to continue further , best wishes !!"
