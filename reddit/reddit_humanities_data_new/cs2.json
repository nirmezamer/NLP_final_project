            "I\u2019m a huge fan of both CS and TF2. However, I started playing both games long after content drops stopped being consistent. I\u2019ll be getting my 5 year coin next week, so that\u2019s my benchmark. \n\nI wish I was around to play those games back when valve cared about them. \n\nI wish I could go back and be excited that a new operation was going to drop in a week or two, while i spent my time waiting for the new operation by playing with the new weapons that valve, my favorite game company, added to team fortress 2. Valve, the company that cared, that made half life, that had all the cool game sales on their all-in-one launcher, that had so many collabs with other games and brands, that had Gaben, who were the \u201ccool guys\u201d of the gaming industry, with the new flashy gun skins and new maps and missions and cases and such. To keep ranking up with a matchmaking system that wasn\u2019t completely broken and unclimbable, to do that while still getting to play my favorite maps. And when I got too impatient for competitive CS, I could go to TF2 and press one button and queue into a fun, working server where I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about cheater bots. All the while not having the experience get at all stale because I knew that new content was always going to keep coming so I\u2019d never get bored.\n\nI yearn to go back to a time I never was a part of, but I miss nonetheless. I know it existed, and I missed out on it. I know that Valve used to be the company that cared. I know they can be that company again, but how do we get them to?",

They should just allow us to look at the map, select the 10 reinforcements and where to put them. It's just a waste of time and nobody knows what they're doing because most ppl don't know the maps by heart. Rounds need to be quicker, more shooting, and more rounds. Game feels so slow it's unbearable with only 4 rounds...  I could give less shit about new operators, I want the game to be playable in the 1st place",

            "i have a lot of hate for post-panorama shitty money-grubbing operations, but honestly shattered web at least got mission design done well. competitive missions don't ask for any funny business or any specific strategies that might hurt your team, they just say \"hey, try to win on this new map\". but also, they have secondary requirements that just ask you to play at all in case you have trouble winning.\n\nthey're not super deep or anything, but its by far the best way of implementing challenges that don't derail the point of competitive mode.",

            "I still play from time to time, but for months i didnt have normal game. Sad where it ended up. And a lot of issues are like 2-3 of work max to fix. Clearly not a single dev is playing the game and devs only listen to some small group of fpl/pro players that never touched premier or mms. Just sad.",

            "How is it obvious when they use a completely different word? You're jumping through mental hoops like crazy to assume that.",

            "Find something else to care about then, because Valve doesn't give a shit.",
            "Yeah they were always a huge grind, but at least the missions were really cool. Wildfire was the first operation I bought and the mission book was so fucking cool, I\u2019m hoping they just didn\u2019t have time in the more recent operations to make missions because they were working on CS2. Imma be sad if they never come back",
            "ya u had to play only casual for it i only got silver cause of that",

            "In game event. Lasts a few months usually. The details have varied over the years but the last few have been a new case, maps, at one point the added the agent skins.

I forget what they were but it's like go here and do X, get x number of kills in this mode, get 10 flashbangs, stuff like that.\u00a0\n\nSome of the elaborate ones have included like story mode missions with entirely new maps built just for like a rescue mission or something. Lots of fun with friends.\u00a0",

Companies are so incompetent at managing the situation, letting hackers use a spoofer or smthing to just get back into the game while shadow banning legit players who has to wait out days to a week. Even cs low trust is basically a shadow ban. We are just relying on systems that function off of stats and report volume rather than actually finding new ways to detect cheating software.",

            "If I was you I'd get me second acc and try to rank it. I feel like the ranking matches are the most fun ones. After that its just +200 -400 for me",
            "Riot actually gives you some respect as a customer. Valve on the other hand. Wew.",
            "Clearly Valve is risking the billions they make through cases and keys every year by going rogue and selling cheats for a few hundred grand.\n\nOf course they aren\u2019t. They are just dead set on making a non-intrusive anti-cheat and this is what costs them (at the moment).",
            "or...hear me out....or you format your drive and forget about it",
            "It's good to not focus only on one game and rather have a few to switch around.",
            "this is so true that there is nothing to add",
            "Exactly thats also a point i care about. I have 3000 matches and also face Accounts that have like 100-500 matches super weird winrates k/d's... Sometimes they are even verified.",
            "Personally haven\u2019t had anything like that. Prob DMA or smthing. They won\u2019t last and are very expensive. Feel better knowing that dude tossed like 2 grand to cheat against u just to get banned soon.",
            "There are almost as many cheater on faceit as there are on premiere,the difference is that they get banned usually.\n\n+more toxicity and trolls compared to premiere(even with premium)\n\n+smurfs with brand new accounts at least 1/3 of the matches you play at level 7 and under(on premium is the same)\n\nAt this point we need a better 3rd party platform cause valve for sure won\u2019t do shit to improve premiere unless the gambling addict retards stop giving this shitty company their money.",
            "I'm one of the top players on faceit both in csgo and now cs2. You're just facing account boosting smurfs. There are very close to 0 cheaters on faceit. It currently has the best ac to ever be made and only very expensive hardware stuff works there. You need to realise 4k elo guy smurfing will look like a cheater in your eyes, that's it.",
            "Same",
            "I did play on ECL a long time which you also needed to pay for. They closed some months ago because of the lack of players. I cant find any free hub.",
            "No shot you lose 7k rating in 4 days without team killing yourself into -1000 several times",
            "It take a bit to understand abilities but once you are setup it is easy to understand. What is more annoying to me is the lack of willingness to play as a team, a lot of players do not communicate, setting up a simple flash and smokes for a site execute is very difficult, even more for more complex strats. But in the end, when you consider the lack of cheaters and nice content updates, I think it is worth it",
            "I alrdy hit top 1000 in the leaderboard without cheating. I dont think it will get higher than that. The funny thing is that i only played premiere when it came out. I played to top 2000. Then it became unplayable because of cheaters. Since that i played like 5 matches in total always with cheaters in my team or in the enemy team. I always get placed same rank as i deranked cuz of inactivity. Suddenly next day i get pop up that im in top 1000. I guess bann wave. I played 1 single match in like 2 months and got in top 1000 lmao",
            "Their Anticheat is a huge as security risk (like any ring0 anticheat). I wouldn't Install that shit on my PC even if I could. But I guess it all depends on everyone's personal priorities. If you use your PC only for gaming there is probably not much harm to be done.",
            "Depends. Riot is Chinese, and their anti cheat is basically a virus. They will prolly sell ur info to the government.",
            "Lol not entirely. They just released a $500 commemorative league skin for the GOAT player Faker, yet he himself doesn't even use skins \ud83e\udd23",
            "That's not true at all",
            "They care so much about the billions that we haven't ever had a proper anticheat essentially ever, how is that even possible?\n\nBut I agree ain't no way they would risk it for the little money cheats would generate for them",
            "Why would you format your drive when you can just click uninstall?",
            "USB cheats, popular since October, faceit is unable to detect it, so u have to make movies about cheaters for them to take any action, and even then, they will ban the cheater for smurfing not for cheating.",
            "Yesterday a play a match vs a stack of 5, all verify, all less than 100 matchs, all with brand new steam accounts.\n\nStupid kids still lose the match xD",
            "Indian verified id accounts i saw them somewhere around 40-50$. Also there is some exploit where u can switch accounts i saw multiple 100 hour accs with like 200 matches.",
            "Imo lots of smurfs. Which is true",
            "DMA is almost completely unbannable I wouldn\u2019t hold out for the idea that many of these people will get banned",
            "That's bs. Search for faceit cheats on Google and you'll see. There are a lot of closet cheaters on that platform. They are stuck at around 1800 ELO bc they are so trash.",
            "That's unfortunate ://. I don't have any more ideas.",
            "Sell isn't the right word, mr pooh can just approach them, say 'hey, we want this and that' and they'll let 'em have it"
