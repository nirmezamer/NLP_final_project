If it is just an extremely violent video for the sake of violence it will be removed. There will be no videos with footage of someone dying in it from here on out as well. Violators will be banned.\n\n2 - Locked & removed posts. We do get questions about why we lock or remove posts and the answer is pretty simple, if the comments are a shit show where people are being racist, homophobic, transphobic, misogynistic and overall toxic it will get shut down. We don't have time to babysit childish/ignorant people. The mods and automod remove a lot of comments so you may not always see what occurred.\n\n3 - You cannot threaten violence at anyone, you will be banned and it happens a lot. Holy shit how do people not know that?\n\n4 - Racist comments, we can see the gist of what your comment implies so just keep it to yourself or expect a ban when you post it. You are not as clever as you think you are & playing dumb/lying about it in your appeal will get you nowhere.\n\n5 - Please use the report button to aid us in removing rule violations, it helps us tremendously.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you to all that enjoy freakouts and woohoo on hitting 600k members!",
