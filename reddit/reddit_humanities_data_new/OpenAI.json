            "How will you know if you have access to 4o yet? In the demo it looked like the voice button was different, that\u2019s all I could tell from a glance",
            "So, Siri will most likely be a more fine-tuned-for-siri-purposes and a downsized version of GPT4o. \n\nThe demo where they had it switch up the tone was absolutely insane to me. The fact that we're at a point where a model can reason with voice, can identify breathing, gender and emotion with voice, and have a model that can modify it's own output voice is INSANE. \n\nFor context, open source is nowhere close to this level of capability. You currently need different utilities to do this, and it does not work as seamlessly and as well as the demos. This makes making assistants significantly easier. I think we may be headed towards an economy of assistants.",
            "I dont understand what people were expecting? i went in with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised, this is a very good step in the right direction for AGI, i do feel it seems to retain some feel of emotions and wittyness in the tone, i believe once things are ironed out and advanced it will be amazing. i'm actually more so impressed with the live viewing thing.",

Detailed text in images.\n\nI don't know about the rendering quality, but in terms of composition, doesn't this crush every other image-gen service?",
            "I loved the announcements today but am disappointed to learn that the app for computers is only for MacOS. Such a shame... I was so excited to run it on my windows PC.\n\nEdit: Don't want to be responsible for bad info.\n\nAs pointed out below, just saw on the news page its MacOS first and Windows is coming later this year: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/22u2kmfbj80d1.png?width=729&format=png&auto=webp&s=305ee8f334598c53fe900abe17fb5c8fe90a2000",

            "Prior to GPT-4o, free users got ChatGPT with GPT-3.5, which is not very impressive. The quality of responses was obviously low.\n\nHowever, now when the free tier has 10-16 messages of GPT-4o every 3 hours, there's a much greater incentive for users to upgrade. Free users get a small taste of how good GPT-4o is, then are thrown back to GPT-3.5; this happens quickly due to the message limit being so low.\n\nAfter seeing how capable GPT-4o is, there is a great incentive on the user's end to upgrade to Plus - much more so than before, when they only saw GPT-3.5.\n\nI hit the limit today after only 10 messages on GPT-4o, and then could only keep chatiing with GPT-3.5. Seeing the stark difference between them seems to be more motivating to upgrade than before - so it seems like this move by OpenAI is very, very smart for them, financially speaking.",

Is this correct?\n\nIf this is true, is this the first time OpenAI has released a non Dalle model for image generation? and I am wondering what would the differences be between DAlle3 and GPT-4o model generation?\n\nThanks",

How did nobody at OpenAI foresee this? Or is that being too charitable?",
            "I'd wish they finally get rid of the \"chat-bot\" approach. Instead of getting a bloated \"smal talk\" responses, I would pay the full subscription price for a factually correct precise SHORT answers. Then it could become a useful tool instead of a toy.",

            "So is GPT-4/Turbo better than GPT-4o in any ways? The comparison between the 2 on the OpenAI website seems to show that GPT-4o is better than 4-Turbo in every aspect. Would there be any cases you\u2019d use 4-Turbo over 4o?",
            "I got access it seems, I tried it and it seems way faster than the normal 4 model. I've been a paying user for a long time, and I wonder if the plus sub is worth anymore? \n\nPersonally I don't care about the speed as much as it's actual output and context window etc. so it's a bit of a let down for me",

            "So, quick question, I think i have GPT-4o but there is no \"screen share\" (like with Khan Academy example) or a way to have it access my camera while the voice assistant is on. Is that being rolled out or is it device specific (I'm on android or PC)?",

Intelligence (the ability to archieve goals, without help (means, also without the help of all the dead people your feet stand upon to make you look larger)\n\nKnowledge can fake intelligence and wisdom both because you could have learned the solution or you just repeat the wisdom like a parrot.\n\nits also problematic to measure intelligence if the person is well educated. Because, a educated person can cheese a way through the test, with its knowledge.\n\nthe same is true for LLM.\n\nthey pass as \"kinda intelligent\" because.... they have a lot of knowledge. They learned the right answeres on all the tests you test their intelligence with. The second you ask them a brand new intelligence test they never heard the answere for, they fail and by this show they are less intelligent than even a dog.\n\nIntelligence is independant to knowledge.\n\nWhat we created so far are mashines that have knowledge. No mashine was ever created yet, that has intelligence. (But I believe that mashines CAN have intelligence. But not yet).\n\nEDIT:\n\nOr say, an ape getrs the banana hanging from the ceiling, by stack several boxes and climb up.\n\nif that ape has never seen someone do this, then its intelligence.
