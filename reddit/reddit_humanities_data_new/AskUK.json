            "By brother aged 18 was in a drunk pub fight, three 18 year olds fighting. The other two pulled knives and then the fight abruptly paused, at that moment police arrived and all three were arrested, whole thing on cctv and everyone watching.\n\n\nThree separate charges of drunk and disorderly and weapons or whatever, my brother gets told to plead guilty with such obvious evidence - on thr cctv he is involved, but doesn't have a knife, nobody got hurt. Two years of banned from all pubs and clubs, wearing an electronic anklet with a night time curfew and a criminal record.\n\n\n\u00a0The other two pleaded innocent, CP didn't want a court case, their cases dropped and got off with nothing even though they brought out knives in a pub fight.",

            "I was in a relationship from 17-35, we had two kids together, she left me for a bloke I\u2019d been working with who I thought was a mate. I went to confront him, things went badly, I chopped up his work van with an axe I had in the back of my truck (I was working in forestry at the time). Like completely obliterated it\n\nThe police were called and turned up just after I\u2019d eaten the eighth of hash I had in my pocket. They arrested me and took me into the station, I got chatting with the young PC who\u2019d arrested me on the way in. Once we got to the station, he interviewed me, wanting to know all the ins and outs of what had happened. I was absolutely straight with him, fully expecting to be punished to the full extent of the law and told him exactly what had happened. He took my statement then went off to talk to his sergeant\n\nHe came back a couple of hours later and told me he\u2019d managed to get me off with a caution as the person whose van I\u2019d destroyed wasn\u2019t wanting to press charges ( I\u2019d told the copper that I knew the van was being used with no MOT and there was red diesel in the tank, when the police asked him about this, he declined to press charges). He also said he was waiting for an answer from his sergeant about whether he could let me have the axe back\n\nUnfortunately, the sergeant decided that was a step too far and they confiscated the axe but I got off with a caution for criminal damage when I fully expected a court case and possible prison time. At one point the PC told me that he\u2019d been divorced under similar circumstances a couple of years previously and he\u2019d love to have been able to do what I did. This was twenty odd years ago now and I still can\u2019t quite believe how lightly I got off",

He was always hanging around, drunk no matter what time of the day it was when you saw him. Everyone just considered him harmless until he began getting aggressive toward some people, eventually exposing himself at Sainsbury's.\n\nUpon further research, my friends and I found out that he's got a rap sheet a mile long, with charges ranging from public drunkenness to kidnapping. After he was run in for the Sainsbury's incident, many of the people that he had abused and threatened were contacted by police to share their stories, because at this time, a lot of people, especially those with children, were scared.\n\nThe aggressive and exhibitionist pisshead was *encouraged* to go to rehab in lieu of a proper punishment.

            "Me and my mate once stole a pedalo and went from Spain to Africa.\n\nImmigration didn\u2019t care.",
            "Maybe not the right thread for this, but I used to work for probation in a court (the team who writes the sentencing reports) and in the legal system it happens a lot less than people think; there are usually reasons for seemingly \u201clax\u201d decisions. Can\u2019t share specific examples obviously, but will provide my experience.\n\nWhat a lot of people don\u2019t realise about prison vs. Community sentences is that short prison sentences actually can\u2019t do anything to tackle problems behaviour, whereas the equivalent community sentence can be made much longer and onerous in order to do so (you can get a three year CO or 2 year suspended sentence for crimes that only allow a few months of imprisonment). Otherwise people just come out and fall straight back into their old patterns as they\u2019ve basically spent a few months in a shit hotel at our expense. Sometimes criminals will state a preference for prison for this reason. The only real good a short prison sentence can do is to prevent contact between someone who is going to commit violence and their potential victim(s). So the only real cases of someone getting a slap on the wrist I can remember as being particularly egregious were domestic violence cases, where the prosecutor couldn\u2019t prove how serious the violence was and someone who clearly was a danger to their partner and/or the public was given a completely inappropriate community sentence or even a fine on the basis of a common assault rather than GBH/wounding etc. Probation staff would on these occasions try to lead the court to harsher sentences by saying someone \u201cwas unable to be managed in the community\u201d but courts don\u2019t have to take their advice and if you\u2019re convincing and have a good lawyer the you might get a token punishment. Another one that was weird was some sexual offences, where sentencing honestly seems a bit fucked up, either because some crimes aren\u2019t taken seriously enough (flashing is a lot more of a serious as a warning sign of future serious offences than we treat it, sometimes rapes aren\u2019t prosecuted as rapes but as lesser offences to get a conviction leading to absurdly low sentences etc.) or because older/disabled sex offenders can\u2019t be accommodated in our prisons, so they get fairly meaningless orders. The only other example is that sometimes women are treated more leniently because their kids would otherwise need to go into care, which makes sense for the kids, but never quite sat right with me.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting too who doesn\u2019t get any benefit of the doubt. Immigrants and refugees don\u2019t because they have fewer interpersonal links that could prevent them from future offending (and prison makes them easier to deport), young men with behavioural problems don\u2019t because they\u2019re annoying/obnoxious, homeless people, especially those with substance misuse problems don\u2019t for both of the reasons above. Rule number one if you\u2019re in court is \u201cdon\u2019t be a dick\u201d because people in court talk and if your lawyer hates you, the CPS lawyer hates you, the clerk hates you, and the probation officer hates you, things can be framed in a way to get you a much more severe sentence than you otherwise might. To try and get a slap on the wrist id say be contrite, polite and hire the best lawyer.",

He was stealing hundreds of pounds a week by pretending the ticket machine had jammed, not issuing the ticket and keeping the fare for himself. \n\nThe company had had suspicions for months because his takings were always just a little bit less than the other drivers. He got sacked on the spot one day, but because the managers were inept they\u2019d cocked up whatever procedures they were supposed to follow and had no hard evidence, just suspicions, so he managed to get his job back on appeal thanks to his union rep. \n\nManagement didn\u2019t want to admit they\u2019d messed up so badly, and I guess they didn\u2019t want the bad press that would come with reporting it to the police, so the whole thing just\u2026. went away.

At that point I lost it\u2026 took a sledgehammer to his front door, gained entry to his flat and gave him \u201ca slap\u201d. He was hospitalised for a short period with a couple of broken bones, nothing remotely life threatening. I was arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault and battery with a weapon (there was no weapon involved) and aggravated burglary. Both prison sentences. I was told 8-10 years. In the police interview I declined a solicitor and told the absolute truth. Told them everything that had gone on previously and how the police and housing association had ignored what was going on etc. The charges got dropped to much lesser ones and I did 120 hours community service and had to pay \u00a3400 for a new front door\u2026 I feel I \u201cgot off\u201d extremely lightly. No I\u2019m really not proud of it and I wish it could have been dealt with a better way. 3 months later he was evicted, a week after that he threatened a woman with a knife and went to prison for several weeks, 2 months after that he threatened a bouncer with a knife and went to prison for several months, a few months after that he stabbed a woman and went to prison for 6 months. He\u2019s now dead from a drugs overdose. Crazy part of my life that\u2019s for sure",

This would\u2019ve been from July 1990 to July 1992. \n\nBack then stores didn\u2019t open on Sundays every week but the Government allowed them to apply for special Sunday trading in the build up to Christmas (which effectively meant being open for 2 or 3 Sundays in December, for 6 hours).\n\nMy normal pay was initially \u00a35.25 an hour with London weighting, so I\u2019d get about \u00a380 cash in hand (\u00a340 for each Saturday shift, after National Insurance payments) every two weeks (yes, we got cash in a little brown envelope with a payslip that we had to collect from a special window instore).\n\nBut for Sundays, as they were both unusual and not popular with staff, we were offered double pay, so \u00a310.50 an hour plus time off in lieu (pro rated for part timers like me).\n\nBy the time I left ASDA in 1992 to go to uni, I was getting \u00a36.50 an hour on the tills for a normal day, and \u00a313.00 an hour for a Sunday.\n\nNo chance of that happening nowadays when you adjust for 32 years of inflation.\n\nThe Bank of England inflation calculator says that \u00a313 in 1992 is now \u00a327.81 adjusted for inflation. \n\nWow.",

I used to work there during the earlier WalMart years and it still had the old Asda ethos. Family friendly employer, quite well staffed.\n\nThen slowly but surely it got worse and worse. Do more with less. Do more with less. The overhaul in 2013(ish) of the management structure saw a mass promotion of colleagues to Section Leaders (for base rate of pay plus \u00a31.00 per hour), replacing a lot of managers who were salaried. Turnover of said section leaders got just as bad as it was at colleague level.\nThere was also a change in stocking policy.\n\nThey used to have constant stock in the warehouse with the majority worked/shelved overnight and then supplemented with multiple deliveries a day.\nThen they reduced all the warehouse space and introduced 'top stocking', so those cases above the shelves became the warehouse space instead. Everything now sells outs quicker leaving empty shelves everywhere.\n\nI was lucky, I saw the writing on the wall and got out a few years ago and have never looked back.\n\nSince the Issa brothers took over, even going in for shopping now it feels like a cheap discount pound store.",

            "I worked there for 9 years. Albeit in the Walmart. Home shopping was genuinely the start of the downfall for me. \n\nSo each department is assigned a number of hours, this is also driven by sales. So a department can be over or under on wages depending on how sales go. \n\nThe cycle goes like this and until home shopping I recall it held up alright. So, sales are a little off forecast, hours are over, you send people home and cut overtime. Theres stock in the back unworked, there\u2019s people queuing for a Pizza or a piece of Salmon and they don\u2019t get service. Vicious cycle. They send people home early doors and the rest of shift never catches up, departments lose sales due to barren shelves. \n\nNow when home shopping came in, some bright spark decided to implement this as an in store venture. This really didn\u2019t help. Firstly, the aisles are littered with home shopping carts and their assigned employee. Secondly, the cost to employ these people is devastatingly high and the requirement far exceeds the increase in assigned wage budget. And lastly, because Asda are constantly in the aforementioned vicious cycle, the shelves are now even more barren than before and because of this sales are less, so there\u2019s even less staff to get things back up to speed. \n\nHome shopping became the priority over the in person customer.",

It was the closest thing to what they had in the states, which was a shopping experience to behold in itself - half a day wandering around a massive shop (with wide aisles) that sold just about everything. Fancy a gun or motorbike alongside your milk and sliced loaf, type of place. Anyway, I digress....... \n\nThe past year or so, Asda has turned into a sorry state of affairs. It often looks like a plague of locusts have been through.......with whole sections of the fruit and veg aisles totally empty. I couldn't get tomatoes, celery, onions or potatoes today. I went round to the cheese chiller (you know the bit, 2 packs of sliced cheese for a fiver and blocks of Cathedral City etc).  There was nothing, (apart from the very expensive cheeses), just dozens of empty boxes in the chiller. They can't even be arsed to take the empty boxes away to make it look a bit tidier. On to the deli section - cooked meats etc, again, rows of empty boxes. \n\n  \nThere are always dozens of personal shoppers running around with their carts, fulfilling online orders (or trying to), whatever do they use to 'substitute' in the orders that can't be fulfilled? No wonder you hear stories of people getting chocolate moussse in place of toothpaste..........................\n\nMany years ago, before I met her, Mrs Nedd use to work in Asda while at college, she says each section was allocated a worker, who's job was to mantain and stock *only* that section (hers was toiletries), thereby assuring it was always clean, tidy and well stocked. Looks like that idea went out of the window some time ago.\n\nSo, OP, yep, it's a shithole.",

They've already increased the number of departments a manager is expected to cover. The cuts aren't coming from them, it's coming from higher up than store level. They're expecting even more cuts next quarter, it's not going to get better. \n\nA couple of years ago they got rid of the earned bonus a store could get for hourly colleagues with the promise of competitive hourly rates.

A days filming can produce as little as 3 mins of screen time (actually that's quite a lot for some productions). \n\nAs such, whatever foodstuff is seen on screen is seldom what it appears and in the case of drinks, non transparent cups are the favoured choice as maintaining continuity on liquid levels is a nightmare when it comes to the edit.  \n\n(This is the reason the infamous empty cup\u2122 is often held by actors)\n\nIn the case of clear glasses though, obviously the rules had to be different.\n\nGiven the actor might have to have done the take 20+ times (mainly for the purposes of getting multiple camera angles, rather than faulty acting),  drinks are never alcoholic in nature on TV/film, drugs are never real (sorry fans of the Wolf of Wallstreet who think they were) and most of the food and drink is spat back out again at the end of the scene.\n\nNotice I said \"had\". Thanks to the wonders of CGI, now it is possible to fake liquid in clear glass very easily (and cheaply) and a lot (might even be most) of film and television now has entirely fictitious liquid swirling around which eliminates continuity error which frees up the editing room from this evil restriction.\n\nSo learn to appreciate that Ribena looking substance. That actor had to drink gallons of the stuff and the editor had sleepless nights cutting the scene so the drink level remained non distracting. These people suffered for your amusement.

At Waitrose, there's something called 'the Waitrose stone', which is the amount of weight most people put on when they first join as newbies dive into the free food.
