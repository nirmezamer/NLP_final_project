What is the logic of this? Is there a trick to remembering this?\n\nAlso, I see so many guitar fretboard maps online and they\u2019re all inverted from what you see when you actually hold the guitar.

            "Apologies if I don't really know how to describe this very well. I'm still relatively new to playing guitar, and still very new at learning about recording and putting songs together. I notice in the music I listen to (mostly hard rock, and some light metal), the sound of the guitars is always very sharp and crisp and has a high level of clarity.\n\nAdmittedly, I'm just a \"bedroom guitarist\" with a $500 guitar using NeuralDSP plugins on a laptop, so I'm sure I'm limited with how good I can get the final output to sound. But I notice my sound always lacks that sharpness or that clarity. It always kinda sounds grainy or blown out no matter what I do.\n\nSo, I guess my first question is, what is the actual difference that I'm hearing? Is that a matter of better gear? Better recording space? Is it just a matter of post production stuff (like EQ, etc.)?\n\nAnd follow up question, then; is that attainable for a \"bedroom guitarist\" with a $500 guitar using NeuralDSP plugins on a laptop?",

I press the bottom pad of my palm against the bridge when I can. Unfortunately I think this causes my wrist to be in a state of always being bent up, which is wearing on my upper forearm, causing the same type of burn as if you were using a mouse with your arm elevated high off the desk.\n\nDoes this sound like something I need to address, or will a better practice regiment take care of this?",

Are there any better-known artists who play in a similar style that I could study to try to learn?  Specifically what I'm looking for is like \"Youth\" (opening track) and \"Celluloid\" (second-to-last):\n\n* upbeat rhythm\n* emphasis on upper strings\n* jazzy harmony\n* also really like the kinda staccato/\"scratchy\" muted articulation on \"Youth\"",
            "I find my luck in getting replies is less when I post in these types of threads.  Prove me wrong, r/guitar!\n\nI'm a long-time bassist transitioning over to guitar.  I stuck with it mostly out of need and because I initially found pedals and amps confusing, so I just plugged in and played.  I recently just joined a punk/pop-punk style band in the vein of Ramones, Misfits, NoFX, etc.  I'm the second guitar player in the band; my co-guitarist plays a Mesa Boogie Dual Rectifier 100W head through a 4x12 speaker cab (also Mesa).  The pedalboard is very basic; just a wireless guitar, tuning pedal, boost for leads, and noise suppressor.  Guitarwise, he's playing a Jim Root signature Fender Tele with dual humbuckers.  I'm rocking an Epiphone Les Paul Standard, and I also own a 40th anniversary Squier Strat model with the standard 3 single coil pickups.  I also own a Headrush MX5 guitar amp modeler that I will probably have to end up using strictly as a pedal.\n\nI'm trying to get in the weeds of tone, amps, pedals, etc a lot more.  I have several questions that I'm curious about:\n\n* Watched some production videos about how NoFX uses single coil Fenders to get their sound much tighter/less bassy.  Saw a life video of El Hefe playing a Tele from about 4-5 years ago and started to think that maybe it might sound cooler if I played single coils while my other guitarist played his humbuckers.  He plays more of the leads primarily, so this may not make too much sense.  I also watched a video on how to get a pop punk sound out of the Gojira plug-in.  Tried it both on my Squier and Epiphone and the Epiphone sounded way bassier and ballsier (duh).  I really just want a ELI5 explanation of why that is, what to mess around with on my head, pedals, etc when I plug in.\n* Other guitarist isn't a huge fan of the digital stuff, or solid-state amps really.  I've done a little research and it seems like tube amps are more preferable for what we play, but both styles serve their purposes.  However, I would rather just use the Headrush as my pedalboard since the pedalboard will be basic and I have some variation of the pedals he has.  Would the best way to achieve this be to basically create a board with only the pedals needed (boost, noise suppressor), set the \"Global Settings\" to AMP to bypass any modeling, plug into the FX loop, and just run through the cab's distortion?\n* Piggybacking on the above, what are my best in-Headrush options for a noise suppressor and a boost for leads?  I'm assuming it needs to be in the \"dynamics\" section when selecting pedals.  I see a lot of compression pedals, does that do what I need it to?",

            "It seems insane to me that people actually memorize scales on the entire fretboard. I'm really trying to learn how to improvise, I'm doing this using CAGED system and the different positions corresponding to the chords, but it doesn't really connect.\u00a0\n\n\nI've only learned 2 positions so far, and I'm trying to include both when I'm improvising, but it feels like I'm manually switching positions instead of just flowing with it. How do people go from being robotic as I am to flying on the fretboard without actually thinking about it? It sounds even crazier to me when you have 5 different positions and then 12 keys so you'd have to memorize where everything is for each key. How do people do this so flowlessly",

I recently joined a cover band because I felt I had plateaued for long enough, and as a result I've been playing songs I never would have before and can hear my improvement. I'm fairly certain that my solos sound...uniformly amateurish, really like scale runs, maybe skippy little things that resolve to the root.

The strings are old but i've had this issue since the guitar setup, at the time i blamed it on my little 5w yamaha amp.\n\nI've got a 2000s fender standard telecaster that has had a really strange tone issue which I have trouble and am embarassed to try to describe: I bought it online and took it to a local big box store for setup - my first electric in over a decade. Brought it home, plugged into a yamaha desktop amp and the b string sounded blown out, even on a clean channel (amp model). To put it into words.. I'm not sure. Harsh, bright, distorted, then phases out like someone is rolling down the tone knob.\n\nI assumed it was an issue with this amp and I eventually upgraded, but I'm noticing the same thing with my new one (a spark 40). Most noticeable when I have my amp set close to breakup, both the g and b strings, most on the G. But this doesn't sound like breakup when it happens - it sounds **nasty**. Fretting or open doesn't seem to matter. Pickup selector doesn't seem to matter. There's some minor fret noise on the open g string, but it doesn't affect the tone and the b is clean. The setup has both pickups angled slanty, closer to the strings higher up, but the high e seems fine. The action on these strings is already higher at the bridge relative to the others, but they are closer to the middle.\n\nSometimes I can detect some rattle/buzzing that seems like it is coming from the pick guard (i can silence it by pressing on the neck pickup). But doing so doesn't seem to fix the issue.\n\nI feel like i have eliminated\n\n* amp\n* pickups\n* string noise against frets/neck relief\n\nI'm due to change the strings and don't want to waste a set if after my basic setup it's still there.

Probably want the ability to add a couple effects pedals.\n\n3) Lunchbox / Micro amp and a small cab. Joyo BanTamp, Orange Micro Dark, etc. or an amp pedal like a quilter superblock or Orange terror stamp.\n\n4) All-in-one pedal like a Line6 HX Stomp, or maybe a DAW plugin like NAM or Amplitube into an FRFR or Studio Monitors.

I'm a pretty solid intermediate acoustic player, been playing for the better part of twenty years, used to play a few gigs and stuff. I'm a good vocalist, and I've leant on that for a long time so my playing has been very stagnant. I've just left the military after ten years, during which it was rarely practical to play with others, so I was pretty happy to learn how get good at finger picking chords in first position down the neck and hum away for myself.

My issue is this: I have no idea where to start. To narrow it down, I'm nervous about getting on vampr or whatever to put myself out there because, even though I have a decent understanding of music theory from classical singing, I have no idea for to translate that to the guitar. If someone says 'it's C, D, Em and G on standard tuning, capo 2' I can pluck away a nice rhythm accompaniment no problem. But if I'm asked to 'play along, key of D' in any other style or with the rhythm slot taken, I'm lost.

            "I want to buy an acoustic guitar.  \n\n1. Should I?  I have been learning on my daughter\u2019s Luna with a scale length of 22.5\u201d.  I had a luthier do a pro setup on it, and it plays great.   I do have very small hands for a man.  I don\u2019t have too many issues with the 22.5\u201d feeling too small right now, but I played a full size dreadnaught Yamaha the other day in a store and I was surprised it didn\u2019t really feel too big at all for the basic chords I know (most of the major and the minors).   Sounded really great to me.  Full barre version of F chord was fine.  The A chord was significantly easier for me to pull off without messing up, compared to the Luna, but I am getting better every day at the A chord on the Luna.  Would it be beneficial for me to keep learning on this smaller scale for any reason?  I am playing the ukulele as well, so I do get plenty of practice on smaller scales, albeit with wider space between the strings.  \n\n2. If I should get a full size, what should I get?

            "Hello! I wanted to ask about a couple of recommendations and a general nudge in the right direction regarding rhythm playing.\n\nI really like acoustic flatpicking rhythm guitar that involves picking out individual melody notes while strumming chords. Maybelle Carter is a great example of someone who does this well (Wildwood Flower being a prime example of this sort of style) even though she technically doesn't really use a flatpick. Neil Young's acoustic playing is a more contemporary example. Recently I found out that this kind of thing is very common in bluegrass too and so I started going down that rabbit hole a bit and getting really into the likes of Tony Rice and Norman Blake. I find both Rice and Blake (a lot of the famous bluegrass players) a bit too shreddy and fast for my taste so I didn't want to learn their songs all that much.\n\nSo then I started learning a bunch of Maybelle songs because I find she really strikes a good balance between simple melody and still providing rhythm. I've learnt 5 of them now and I love this style of playing, the problem is that she tends to play essentially always in the C position and so I'm getting quite bored of that. So this all boils down to my question: Does anyone have recommendations of songs or players who don't play in a super fast or fancy style who don't always play out of the C position and instead use the E, D, A positions? I know quite a few already in G so I've covered that.",

            " Hey so I\u2019ve played guitar for 5 years and I mostly do fingerstyle and I\u2019m 40% self taught 60% professionally taught. My teacher back in the day was super loose with his takes on guitar style and never really commented on this but I like to pluck the high e with my pinky. Getting back into it after a couple months my muscle memory for plucking with my pinky is still there but I can totally try to break it and use my ring finger instead. Should I do it? I\u2019ve never really heard of anyone who\u2019s used their pinky in this way it just kinda made sense to me and became natural for my hands. I can play songs through just fine as long as there isn\u2019t too many rapid high e notes but songs that require that force me to start alternating different fingers (index and middle) on the high e instead. Which isn\u2019t too awkward, I switch \u201ccontrols\u201d just fine when I know I have too but I do wonder if this is proper.\n\nSo basically to give a visual I use \n\n6 - thumb\n\n5 - thumb\n\n4 - Index/thumb\n\n3 - Middle/thumb\n\n2 - Ring/thumb\n\n1 - Pinky\n\nIt sounds cursed but I play just fine for the most part. To give a general idea, I can do fingerstyle versions of River Flows in you or Stitches by Shawn Mendes just fine. Move to things like Unravel or This Game (For all my anime guitarists out here) and I start to crack a bit due to the amount of notes on the higher strings. Forcing to me to alternate, which isn't that possible on the pinky generally speaking. I can unlearn this and do something more typical but it never really sat right with my plucking hand. I currently just \"shift gears\" and start alternating using the \"better fingers\" on parts that require it and then shift back.",

I used to learn the basic strumming/rhythm part as one of the very first things I ever learned well, but the solo is cool and really not that easy but it's doable with my increased ability. It's got hammer ons, pulls offs, slides, doublestops and bends/prebends in one small package and it sounds nice when you hit it.\n\nI also often go back to working on being able to play pentatonic across the fretboard from the thickest to the thinnest string positions.",

            "Solos are a broad topic simply because everyone has their own opinion on what constitutes as a good solo.  I would advise to not cement it in your head that a solo HAS to be fast or is only shredding, etc.  Some of the most famous solos of all time aren't even super technically demanding, but they DO fit the context of the song, which IMO is the more important part.  For example, you can easily hear a mechanical difference between the Sweet Child Of Mine solo versus Through The Fire And Flames, but they both have solos.  \n\nThat being said, there ARE some general concepts and things you can learn (which I'll get into later) to help you at least get the building blocks of making sense of WHAT you are playing/hearing/reading from tabs, etc.  A lot of it has its basis in music theory, but that doesn't mean you have to be a complete musical scholar to understand and apply them.   There's a decent degree of improvisation involved, but that comes with understanding these general concepts first.\n\nIf your preferred genre DOES have these types of fast solos, (or if you want to try to incorporate them in a genre traditionally not known to have them), I've found they are often primarily mechanical exercises and extensions of most of these topics.  But some things you can look into and search info up with:\n\n* Scales - One of the most common tools in any solo, these let you understand what notes are generally available to use and build familiarity in your fingers.  These apply to any genre, and you'll find them to be a valuable asset to carrying your melodies to different notes.  Also, not always a hard-and-fast rule, but a decent starting point in most cases.\n   * I'd recommend learning at least the minor and major pentatonic (5-note) scales to start.  These are very common repeatable lead shapes that you can use anywhere on the fretboard once you've learned the pattern, and you'll find that a lot of scales are simply added notes within these shapes.\n* Chord Progressions - Yes, this is a rhythm concept, but this is still very helpful for lead players to understand.  Why?  Because your solo is going to be supported by this!  This lets you know what general type of scale will work in that portion of the song.  For example, play the chords D > C > G > D a few times through.  Now try Em > G > D > Em.  Hear a different general tone/theme out of them?  They'll require different bases for solos since they evoke a different general sound.\n   * Also, as you start learning more solo parts, you're going to find out that often times solos usually have a lot of the same notes as the current chord (and can even be arpeggios (or broken out notes of the same chord) of the current chord.  This can help you tonally understand whether your notes \"fit\" or are tonally deviating (which isn't always a bad thing).\n* Modes - This is a more advanced concept that will make more sense as you look more into the previous two and you may not need to know this right away.  But if you were ever curious as to why sometimes the same notes can sound \"happy\" in a certain scale (major) or \"angry\" in another scale (minor), this goes into depth in explaining that.\n   * Super oversimplified explanation: The same notes in a scale produce a different sound depending on where you start playing from.  For example, the key of C (8th fret on low E, for example) is no sharps/flats: (C,D,E,F,G,A,B,c).  If you start this two notes (three frets, in this case) lower, you'll get the Am scale (a,b,C,D,E,F,G,A).  Notice how the notes are the same (no sharps/flats), but simply starting at a different point produced a different scale.  Each starting note produces a different scale, which will produce a different \"sound/tone\" overall.\n\nDon't worry so much about speed right now.  If you want to learn a faster solo, slow that tempo way down and get your hands accustomed to it first.  Once the solo pattern becomes familiar in your hands and you're not checking/thinking about them too much, start gradually increasing the speed.  This is literally how anyone who plays fast GETS to that point.  And that will take time.",

            "Probably a combination of all those issues, it's normal if you literally just started. First off you should aim to use the tip of your finger to fret the note and not have your finger lay flat against the other strings.

            "Either or. They both combine to make sound, so they're both as important as each other. Having said that, an okay instrument with an amazing amp is more likely to sound better than an amazing instrument with an okay amp. When you are able to pick up smaller details and nuances in sound, you probably will already know what is holding you back, the amp or the instrument itself.\n\nAs for which amp to choose, the following is highly subjective and personal opinion.\n\nI have the Boss Katana MkII and I really like it. It is really an emulator and not an amp by itself (if that makes sense) - with everything set to clean, all dials at mid, etc. it is really nothing special. What makes it shine is the different \"modelled\" amps you can dial in, with the overdrive sound you are probably being after being digitally re-created.\n\nBecause of this, I'd recommend looking different types of amps up on YouTube: solid-state digital, solid-state analogue, and valve. For the price range you're looking at, a good comparison might be comparing the overdrive sounds on a fully analogue solid state (such as an Orange Crush), a digital modelling solid state (such as the Katana 50 MkII), to a fully valve overdrive (such as a Marshall DSL5C). That will push you in the right direction for what you are really looking for. I was happy enough with solid state, however if I had money and the space to play loudly and not annoy neighbours, I'd probably throw a valve amp or two in the collection.\n\nIt really comes down to if you don't mind the digital / solid-state sound or if you are really after that purist valve sound you're used to hearing on (pretty much all) of your favourite recordings.",

That's something for when she's doing some serious gigging and even then, it's a bit much. That's basically a relic from a time when people needed big, bulky amps.

            "I use HX Stomp when playing or Helix Native when recording. Both are mainly used for amp simulation. I have various dirt/overdrive/distortion pedals, a multi-reverb pedal, and a Zoia for everything else in between like delays or modulation or some weird effects.\n\nIt's not overkill to get the Quad Cortex just for the amp simulation. The HX Stomp is not as powerful as the Quad Cortex or Kempers but I already find it amazingly flexible. On top of all the pedals you have, you can simulate pre-amp-power amp-speaker combinations with multiple signal chains and multiple pre-sets at once. You can put your pedals in the effects loop, or in front of the amps by tweaking knobs or using the display. You can put your pedals in parallel or put them sequentially. Or you can put the \"amps\" and/or \"speakers\" in parallel or sequentially.\n\nI'm a convert - I've sold all my amps save one some years ago and never looked back.\n\nYou can start with dedicated Amp Sim pedals like Boss's IR-2 or Strymon Iridium or Walrus Audio ACS-1.

I currently have an Arturia Minifuse 2 that has 2 studio/XLR channels - I plan on using that for either the 2 guitars or 1 guitar and the bass. I also have a PreSonus AudioBox GO which looks like it also has 2 channels, but I haven't really used it much. I also have several RockSmith cables, which show up in Ableton as their own interface. The keyboard is connected by USB.\n\nAll of the instruments are hooked up and I can use them in Ableton, but I can only arm one instrument at a time, so I haven't been able to find a way to monitor more than one instrument at the same time. It's entirely possible that I'm just missing a button that is pretty obvious, but I'm just getting started learning how to use DAWs and there's a lot to learn! LOL",

            "Here\u2019s another way, this is a \u201cghetto\u201d option: do you have a mixer or pa? If so, route everything into those channels then take the stereo outs and put em in channel 1 and 2 of your interface. Pan 1 far left, and pan 2 far right. Boom!",
            "Yup, it was my own naivety. In Ableton, I CAN multi-arm tracks, I just have to hold down the CTRL button while clicking on the arm icons.

Great to see all the fantastic submissions and comments.\n\n**The Concept**\n\nThere are two ways you can participate in this thread, and they are not mutually exclusive!\n\n1. **Record a take**\u00a0of yourself improvising over the backing track provided. The idea is not to achieve perfection - record a real, live, raw and unedited solo. It can be a video or just a recording. Upload your take to YouTube or Soundcloud and share it in the comments.\u00a0*Tip: keep your take short and sweet. If you record a 10 minute take, think about chopping it down and submitting just the first few minutes.*\n2. **Give feedback**\u00a0on someone else's take. We're looking for supportive, constructive comments - putting yourself out there for everyone to listen to is scary, and everyone is at a different stage in their guitar journey. Critiques are welcomed, but don't just criticise - offer suggestions on how to improve, and highlight the things you did like too.\n\n**This week\u2019s track:**\n\n[Funky Blues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwzywATXGFU)\n\nIf you have any feedback on the concept as a whole, please let me know in the comments/DM me.\n\n*Check out previous weeks* [*here*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/wiki/index/#wiki_weekly_one_takes)",

            "One of my favorites! Really love all the chordal stuff you\u2019re doing, the embellishing is really beautiful and adds a different tonal character to the track. Great phrasing, I really enjoyed the little R&B/gospel style little tricks thrown in there. \n\nIf you want me to be nitpicky, I would have really enjoyed in a 4 min interval to hear the flow of things rise. With the way you started, I was sort of waiting for you to pick up a pick to vary it up \u2014 keeping my the same feel to blend it over with a pick but then change it up. Besides that, that\u2019s about the only critique I really have. I thoroughly enjoyed your take, thank you for sharing! And next time, it\u2019s cool to just show us the very first take even if you feel wonky about it. Forcing yourself to do it in the first take will generate some great practice.",
            "nice take. it definitely deserves better recording. congrats.",
            "nice, but i was a bit surprised by the abrupt ending.",
            "I liked the chill vibes here! I think you could further add some oomph to it by maybe adding a bit more breaks in your lines, so that the impact of what you play will be felt more?\n\nAnyway, good stuff!",
            "This is a cool take! I like that you decided to speed up the track a bit and have it be more upbeat. I\u2019m having trouble deciphering if your take is also sped up along with it or if you\u2019re really just playing that fast which either way, is fine. To me, it does sound like the track was recorded at original tempo and then the whole thing was sped up, I don\u2019t have a problem with it. \n\nI like some of the ideas you used here and kept it interesting!",
            "Dude, you ripped it!!!! Super fun take, can tell you were feeling it, really love the mixture and variety!",
            "You have a great timing and picking good notes at right times. Perhaps you could try to challenge yourself by venturing beyond the main penta position to explore other things.",
            "Sounded good! Very melodic.",
            "Nice! Like the jazzy lines.",
            "Appreciate a fellow Tele player! I did mine with a Tele too, would appreciate you giving it a listen and any feedback on mine (just submitted in this thread). \n\nAs for feedback for you, since guitar isn't your main instrument I'd say keep at it and try to learn some blues vocabulary. Just sit down and play along with blues artists you enjoy and you'll pick up on vocab in no time! You definitely have potential to go far.",
            "Beautiful guitar. The composition was very listenable, and I liked the extended features you put in the scale. Very nice.  If I had to critique I would say incorporating more elements from the tracks in the backing track. Try to mirror/reflect the concepts and arrangements not just the notes. In the beginning, I think you need to break up the frequency of the notes and give the extended scale elements more time to breath like you do later on in the video. I have a similar finger-picking style to yours and I am trying to develop a habit of parking my thumb on the sting about the strings I'm playing. But instead of resting the side of my thumbnail area I put the pad of my thumb so that the string runs down the middle of my thumb's pad. And it keeps it from muting on the big string bends. Where normally I would bend the string until it hit the thumb of my picking hand.",
            "Love the outside sound in blues. I tried to throw a LITTLE of that in by ear on mine but mine was much more straight ahead traditional electric blues. Would love your feedback on my submission that I just posted.",
            "Nice take! To make some critic, I can give a couple of pointers:\n\n- When trying to play \"in\", try to follow the notes of the chord you're in. For the Am and Dm, it's mainly the corresponding minor pentatonic. That way you have more movement in your soloing.\n\n- For the F-E, you can keep playing more outside as they have tensions. For this, I'd recommend getting some note of tension (e.g., F over E7 that would be the 2b) and getting used to it. You have to \"own\" the tensions if that makes sense, and play them just as you would a normal note and not as if you fell there by mistake. As a teacher once told me, you can play anything if it's on the beat!",
            "My favorite one here some great phrasing and matches the vibe of the track perfectly. What\u2019s your tone setup?",
            "Thanks! Growing up on metal it is difficult to not embrace the shred :DD",
            "Thanks for listening! I cut it before getting into trouble!",
            "Thanks! My rig's crushing that 5x5 lately.",
            "Haha thank you dude! The funny thing? I cut it right before you hear the 8 bars I took to figure out what to do next and just started playing whatever \ud83d\ude02the full 8 minutes or so started to get out there and interesting though!",
            "Thank you man!!! I've been waiting to see you and Strat put up a take!",
            "thanks for the kind words! i was thinking the same thing when i listened back like \u201cthis is kinda boring cuz it feels like it doesn\u2019t really pick up at all, i should\u2019ve used the pick at some point\u2026..\u201d. good to hear someone else say that too so it\u2019ll reinforce that idea for me. i will definitely use a pick in next week\u2019s track when i wanna pick things up/up the intensity. thank you for that ^^\n\n(also i will show the first take next time along w the better one but it\u2019s probably going to be awful lmao)",
            "thank you :) i tried using a DAW at one point but couldn\u2019t get it to work + i don\u2019t like my playing enough yet to want to make a good quality recording of it so the focus is just to improve my playing first then move on to that stuff haha",
            "Thanks - I agree it's abrupt, but it's better than what happened after that moment. :)",
            "Thanks- I bet what happened is that I had warp on (likely to 120bpm) in Ableton but usually that just speeds up the backing track- but who knows, I\u2019ll check when I get home! Funny that I didn\u2019t even notice. I definitely didn\u2019t try to speed anything up on purpose (backing track or my playing- I just suck at using software) EDIT: yep, warp was on, but just the background was sped up, accidentally.",
            "I really appreciate you, man - that means a lot coming from you.",
            "Thanks for your feedback. I ran out of ideas quickly on this one maybe thats why I was stuck there.",
            "Thanks",
            "Thank you for the detailed feedback! Yeah, I know overplaying is something I tend to do quite a lot, it's a good reminder to throw a bit more space between lines. \n\nI've just been playing for a couple of months with fingerstyle on the electric and I'm still figuring it out. I usually park the side of the thumb as I can also mute the upper strings with the thenar eminence (as you usually do when you play with a pick). But this leads to a more angled attack that I'm not so fond of. I'll try your approach to see how I like it!",
            "Thanks for the comment! I just gave you a couple of ideas for your take.",
            "Cheers! Was just straight into my computer using Helix Native for modelling. Can\u2019t remember the exact amp/pedal combo but something along the lines of a dumbleish amp with a boost/OD in front and some reverb and delay, nothing too fancy.",
            " Not an issue at all man!! Just something I noticed, good stuff!",
            "Dude it\u2019s been a while, I can definitely tell you\u2019ve been putting in the work man. Keep it up!",
            "Just got home- had warp on, so the background was playing to 120, but it looks like just the background was sped up-definitely playing pretty close to my limits though speed wise!",
            "Very clean dude!!! What I will say that for me, why I was having trouble figuring out whether it was sped up or not was probably because you have a tendency to pick everything like a classical player would. It sounds incredibly articulate and clean, I like it a lot! I like 1:15 onward a lot because I could sense like you found your rhythm there, great stuff man",
            "your speed is amazing, I thought both were sped up",
            "Thanks- I\u2019ll try to post a video next time!"

Mahogany top is a bit firm for solid protection but has a bit more highs and lows that make fingerpicking really good. And the cutaway at the top of the neck makes you able to play anything.\n\nIf this has electricity (it can plug into an amp) you almost never need another acoustic unless you want to go for specialization.

I recently did this with a $300 Yamaha and had the luthier match my string spacing and change the plastic out to wood for like the bridegrooms, nut, and bridge, and it match it to my Martin.  It made a huge difference in playability and comfort for me.  $120 and 100% worth every penny!",
