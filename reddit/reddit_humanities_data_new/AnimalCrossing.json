            "Just a heads up, I came across a user by the name of anvvsu on Nookazon. I canceled our transaction for a Royal Crown when I noticed just minutes before they received a review from another user claiming that they were scammed out of their crown. This person took the item and then left. I decided not to risk it so I declined. This person then proceeded to message me cursing in my DMs. I already reported them but just beware and keep yourselves safe. People like this really ruin it for everyone and I feel awful for the person who got scammed.",

            "[Closed! Thanks so much everyone! Will definitely do again!] \n\nFREE GIVEAWAY/SCAVENGER HUNT!\n\n\nHey friends! \n\nIn honor of completing my fossils I'm hosting a scavenger hunt giveaway (aka my storage is full please take all the things!)\n\nThere are SIX locations on my island with different kinds of items (Materials, Recipes/food, Gyroids, Clothing, Items, DIY). The scavenger part is you have to explore to find them! They're not super hard to find but I wanted a way where people can actually play and explore rather than filling pockets and leaving, ya know? Leif is also here and I Time traveled to morning so everyone can see. \n\nNo entry fee but if anyone has an extra Log Bed DIY lmk! Also donations/tips are accepted in the box as you enter. \n\nRules:\n1. Leave through the airport! (If you don't it's \"quiet leaving\" and bugs the whole game\n\n2. No picking Flowers, moss, or vines. \n*Shells, fruit, crops, weeds, branches, fishing, shopping, talking to villagers, visiting the museum, and bug catching is welcome!*\nBut please don't pick the flowers, moss or vines. \n\n3. Because of some of the content in my house/island, this island is 18+! It's very much in good humor but if you aren't comfortable with NSFW jokes it's not for you! \n\n4. This island was created in honor of my father who passed suddenly before Christmas. I have a memorial zone- please be super careful to not run over flowers there. \n\nThat's it!!\n\nDodo Code [closed!]\n\nI'll be open until 11pm EST and on intermittently. If you need something message me on reddit- my character will probably be sitting somewhere quietly while I clean my house \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc97",

            "Hello everyone!! I made this post, but it was taken down because the mods said it was better suited for this thread, so that's what I'll do. Here's the post:\nI've been working on my island a lot this past month and it's honestly got me thinking about my inspiration for my island in the first place. Isle Fluff is a love letter to my real life pets. They all have a little spot on the island dedicated to them and built with them in mind. It has brought me so much joy to do so and as of late, has made me think of all the pets I've ever had, of course including the ones I've lost. Every single day, I am so grateful for the love and joy they have brought me and I wanted to make a spot on the island to honor them as well. \nSo, I've built this very expansive marina and, although it may be a bit of a downer, I'd like to invite anyone who would feel so inclined, to come over to my island and plant one flower you love for a pet you might've lost. It would mean a lot to me to visit the marina and see all your beautiful flowers and think of the love that pets bring to our lives. I hope you will read this and come on over.\nIf you want to come and plant a flower, the code is 9Q429",

            "I wanted to share a little tidbit/tip I discovered regarding villager Move Out Thought Bubbles!\n\nIf a villager \\[that you don\u2019t want to move\\] has a move out bubble, you don\u2019t have to ignore them all day!  You can instead go talk to Tom Nook and tell him that you want to relocate that villager\u2019s house.  Villagers that you have the house relocation kit for cannot ask to move, and so this will remove the flag from them and you can continue to talk to them as normal. :3\n\nYou can then talk to all the villagers you want that have thought bubbles, and none of them should be about moving out.  BUT if you reload the game\\*, the move out flag will move to a different villager!  So you can also use this to re-assign who wants to move out without having to TT to a different day.\n\n\\*when I reloaded the game I had also set back the clock by a few hours because I was decorating and it was getting a little too dark.  So I don\u2019t technically know if setting the clock back was important or if it was JUST the reload step.  I had been decorating for hours and talking to every single villager that had a thought bubble the whole time and none of them were about moving out; but immediately upon reloading the first villager with a bubble was about moving out, which is why I\u2019m guessing all bubbles before a reload are safe.\n\n Other bonus tip: you can save on-demand by opening up the Online Custom Designs Portal on your Nookphone!  Useful if you don\u2019t want to risk losing 3-4 minutes of decorating and don\u2019t know if a villager bubble is about move out or not.

My broken window, fixable; work laptop, company will scrub it; the miscellaneous things in my car, replaceable. But the most devastating thing to me was losing my switch. My island, Bean. And because my dumbass never did a manual save, Nintendo doesn't have a backup on file in my account. I'm grateful to be unharmed, and I spent the last 2 days fixing my car and dealing with the aftermath, so I'm relieved to be safe on the roads now. This might be dramatic and I could be overreacting, but it definitely feels like a little piece of me is missing. I spent so much of my time on Bean, and it was my safe haven during Covid. I miss my villagers, my design of Bean, and just all of it. And because I saved all my screenshots to my switch, all I have are the ones on my Reddit that I've posted in the past. I hate it so much and I am no where ready to say goodbye to Bean. I know that starting over will be another adventure though, so hopefully that will be soon since it's all snowy and adorable.

It would be insane of Nintendo to use their resources and time on making the new AC game for a console that will be replaced in like a year of the game coming out, assuming that the game would even be ready before the new console. At best we'd get a shared release for Switch and the new console when it comes out, but even that is a small chance imo.",

You also get 1 wasp and 1 piece of furniture in trees on every NMT mystery island you travel to through the airport if that island has non-fruit trees on it. Your villagers will be crafting in their homes up to 3x per day and will teach you a diy. And the rest will come from balloons, return gifts from your villagers, and random stuff like that.\n\nIf you're into trading and you have an online account, check out the code sharing thread linked somewhere up above, there are also tons of communities like r/NoFeeAC that do requests and giveaways. And Nookazon is still thriving. \n\nIf you want to find treasure islands, you can head to Twitch, Youtube and Discord. There are tons to choose from, just read their disclaimers and be patient.",
            "A lot of the complaints about Easter stem from people who played the game in 2020 - the Easter event happened shortly after the game was released, so people had a hard time getting basic materials needed to move forward in the game like rocks and wood because they kept getting the Easter eggs. Also the Easter event lasted for 12 days, which is a long time for an event in Animal Crossing. After 2020 they changed it to 7 days.

Whether you want to replace some of your native fruit trees or just add more fruit trees in general is entirely up to you.  \n\nWay down the road, when you're trying to get a 5-star island, Isabelle will complain if you have more than 220 trees. Anything below that is entirely up to you and your personal preferences. \n\nNon-fruit hardwood trees are the only trees that will be cherry blossom trees during cherry blossom season and egg trees during easter. Pine/cedar trees become decorated trees around christmas and they'll be the only trees that give pine cones in the fall. So it can be a good idea to keep a mix of different kinds of trees around to help you with resources during certain seasons. \n\nBamboo also counts as trees for your island rating, so don't forget to factor those in. \n\nI recommend keeping a lot of trees if you can just until you reach 3 stars because they're great for island rating points. But you can also make a fantastic island with no trees at all. It's all about your personal preferences and what you like. And if you need wood later you can always use mystery islands to get resources or plant more trees down the road (I always keep a stack of every fruit in storage just in case I have a burning need to plant more fruit trees, hardwood and cedar saplings you can always get from the shop, coconuts are easy to get from mystery islands if you need more later)",

            "There are a few ways to find villagers:\n\n- They comes to your campsite and you invite them\n- You use Nook Mile tickets to go to mystery islands to try to find them (when doing this you must have an empty plot or no villagers will show on mystery islands)\n- See if you can purchase their amiibo (or see if you can find someone that has it and is willing to do what they gotta do so you can come adopt them)\n- Find someone online who currently has them in boxes (for free or for a few)\n- Ask around on subs like r/BuddyCrossing and r/NoFeeAC\n- Try Nookazon (I dunno how that works, never used it because I think it's outrageous) but there's that too\n\nFor the sub NoFeeAC : read their sub rules carefully and set your flair correctly (your comments won't show if no flair, etc). Don't post a post asking for said villager you need to post on the daily request / looking for thread.\n\nGood luck !",
            "The cheapest and easiest option is a wrapped stack of 3 **non**-native fruit.\n\n- It hits the bell cap for the highest friendship increase\n- It doesn't take up villager storage \n- It doesn't use precious materials (like iron)\n\nI've never once had an issue with this method and it's the only I've ever used (as do a lot of people). Seems like you're just having bad luck. Marina was stubborn for me as she took like 5x's longer for a photo than anyone else, not sure why.",
            "Iron wall lamps still work. It sounds like you've hit a streak of bad luck.",
            "You have to trade with other people.",
            "Yes. You need to have an open plot for someone to appear.",
            "Kick them around until you can roll them, once they're both big enough to roll push one into the other. You need to make sure there's space around you for the snowboy to sort of jump and form together so if they're just pushing off each other they either aren't big enough yet or there's not enough empty space.\n\nFor a perfect snowboy, there's a path method and a 6-3-1 method (there's also a counting method and an eyeball method checking against your character's ears but neither of those have worked for me).",
            ">Can I catch them\n\nYes, you can catch the snowflakes (use a net). You will need them to craft certain items\n\n>can I make a snowman with the snowballs?\n\nYes, but they have to be done \"perfectly\", which isn't easy for most. I suggest looking online (Google or Youtube) to read tips/tricks on how to do it right. You only get one shot so if they aren't right you'll have to try again the next day. If they are done right, they will give you a large snowflake (which are also needed to craft certain items). Note that if they are done right, talk to them each day until they fully melt to receive additional large snowflakes.",
            "Read up on the FAQ posted above :)",
            "Yes. On the second page of your nook phone there's an app for the tips, Island Life 101 or something. You can turn them off there",
            "I don't think so :( The 2021 and 2022 ones were available starting December 22nd of those years. We're past that day and still nothing.",
            "https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/animal-crossing-cooking-recipes-how-to-cook-in-new-horizons-full-cooking-recipes-list\n\nI think you need to have completed Projrct K.K. to get access to the cooking recipe app. So it'd be a little while away for you.\n\nBut I think you can already buy vegetables. A sloth named Leif sells them on his cart. You just need to buy the vegetable starts, dig a hole and plant them.\nIf you water them every day, you get more vegetables. You can then pick them, and use them to grow more by planting the veggie in a hole",
            "Since you haven't donated any artwork, Blathers won't get the thought bubble about Brewster (as you have to donate one thing from each category). Redd should have been wandering around your island early on after the museum opened. What I would suggest is go to Harv's and open his stall to see if you can trigger him/get a work to donate.",
            "You can only buy the orderable items when it is unlocked by one of the villagers whose vacation home you've designed. You need to have designed homes for Chief, Filbert, Henry, Kitty, Rasher, Ren\u00e9e, Sheldon, Shep, Simon, or Tex.",
            "You don't need to replant all the flowers to get hybrid colours. The natural flowers can produce them too. For example, mums are my native flower, and I have all the colours without buying any new ones. You just need to plant them in the correct combos that can produce the hybrids (ie. red and white mum next to each other for pinks). But getting hybrids from native flowers can be more difficult for certain colours, mainly the blue rose because it requires very specific combinations. But in general you should be completely fine.",
            "Theres an app for ACNH that I downloaded called Nook Guide. It\u2019s helpful to catalog things so that you know what you\u2019re missing (critters and art for museum), how to breed flowers and it even has a little guide to all residents so that you can gift them more effectively. Pretty nerdy, but it\u2019s super helpful.",
            "No, they nerfed the spawn rates on that method a long time ago",
            "you can still do it but the water bugs screw you up and the spawn rates aren't as high. Farming crops is a good way to make money that wasn't available back in the day.",
            "The holiday events still happen. They are just no new things.",
            "The holiday events will repeat. But like, year 1 there were certain recipes for Halloween. Year 2 they added more. There will be no more added. For example.",
            "nope, you need to build new house for the camper",
            "They will re-appear next Dec 15th. Yes you can time travel to different seasons but I can't remember if they made the events only take place on teh real day (e.g., the Toy Day Reindeer only shows up if its really Dec 24th). But if you TT back to Dec 15th or any day between then and now, there will be ornaments",
            "The ultimate \"end goal\" of HHP is to create a vacation home for every single villager (and NPC if you have Amiibos). Obviously each person can play however they want, and I doubt many people have actually made 400+ homes, but that is essentially why HHP was created.",
            "You can play the dlc if your Resident services has been upgraded, so yes, I'd say it's worth. It can even help you get to 3 stars since you get access to more items through it. But you can also wait to play it at your own pace. You don't need to start it right away.",
            "I would recommend using the different types of furniture. What I mean by that is use some wall decorations, some ceiling ornaments, some rugs can really spice up a place. Try to find small and unnecessary seeming things. I have a vacuum for instance. Does it clean my floors? No. But it adds a layer of humanity to your home. I also really recommend Happy Home Paradise, once you progress in it you can buy almost anything you want for furniture, it\u2019s a handy tool. Hope this helps!",
            "If you choose to what I did was 1. Make sure I get a layout I like, 2. build all my buildings on teh beach from the very beginning, so when I unlocked terraforming they were already out of the way",
            "You have to catch them yourself. I learned this the hard way when my husband used his profile to catch the sea pig for me on the last day it was available. I happily donated it to Blathers only to later learn that it didn't add to my critterpedia!",
