            "Does anyone have some good examples of the Sororitas Exorcist vehicle redressed for Chaos? It would look so good for Word Bearers and the old Chaos Rhino is shows quite a lot of age in comparison.",

Right now I have a Chaos Lord with a mark of Slaanesh leading a 5 man Chosen with a mark of Khorn.\n\nIf I use the Torpefying Refrain stratagem on this unit. Does only the chaos lord get the \"If youer unit is a slaanesh unit, until the end of turn, your unit is eligible to shoot and declare a charge in a turn in which it Advanced or fell back\" bonus?\n\nI would obviously like if having two different marks on a single unit, thanks to having a leader, got me benefits they otherwise couldn't get, but I also understand how that may not be the rules are written.",
            "When I'm rerolling dice (specifically with Oath of Movement or Command Reroll), do I have to reroll all the dice that failed, all the dice in general or only 1 die?",
            "Does the Core rule Change also applys for Combat Patrol?\n\nFor example the New rule that you can use reinforcement Stratagems only once per Game would be a huge Nerf on the Astra Militarum Combat Patrol that very much rely on this Stratagems.",
            "Question about a 9th edition rule, \n\nDo named characters always have their specified warlord traits, regardless of whether they are a warlord or not?  \n\nI'm confused because most sources say that they need to be nominated for warlord first, except for this one definition here. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0wsoflmfet7d1.png?width=742&format=png&auto=webp&s=e38d8bf6246991adaaf69f17406cd266a5556b7e",
            "I'm done my first pass at narrowing down which two factions to start WH40K with, and would appreciate your input to help me narrow it down. Obviously I don't yet own any codices for specific unit info, and only have 10th Ed indices to look through.\n\n* Experienced tabletop gamer / playtester who's new to wargames\n* Johnny+Spike. Will definitely attend local Strikeforce tournaments. I'd see the game as a challenge vs myself more than anything else.\n\nWhat I enjoy and am looking for in descending order of importance:\n\n1. Adaptability\n2. Certainty and consistency in achieving results of \"at least x\", at the expense of power if need be\n   * Flat bonuses\n   * Re-Rolls\n   * Not relying on crits\n   * Crit fail impact reduction\n   * Faction's fave strategems are those that are used on my turns, as opposed to defensively\n   * My high mobility gives me more options to make the right decision\n3. Increasing opponent uncertainty by non-strategem means\n   * Flat negative modifiers\n   * High mobility / deepstrike encourages the opponent to make contingencies\n4. I don't want to retire my minis anytime soon, and I have no idea which minis are new vs due to be made into 'Legends'.\n\nGiven those criteria, the rest of the focus would be on points and winning. That is to say I'd rather the above criteria be met and lose games due to my decisions and bad meta than regularly win through a 50% coin toss.\n\nI like pretty much all the lore. If I have 'gotcha' abilities, I always remind opponents about them. I can have fun with hordes, or just a few units. I care more about depth than complexity, if that makes any sense.",
            "Last year when they made making army lists free on the gw app I made like 6 lists and I\u2019m still able to view and edit them if I sign into my gw app with my account now will it delete those armies? Also if I pay for premium make a bunch of armies then when I cancel the membership do I keep all the army lists I made?",
            "So outside of asking a TO to overule it, is it still correct that non-codex Chapter unique marine units (e.g crusade squad, proteus killteam) can't have an Apothecary/Lt+(Captain/Chapter master) as although they would normally both be allowed to attach, the unique units aren't in the \"above list\" called out in the ability of the Apoth/Lt?",
            "Question on a combo before I commit to it.\n\nWith the Repulsor update I believe 6 Eradicators and an attached Gravis Captain will fit in a 14 capacity Repulsor.\n\nCan the Vanguard Spearhead stratagem \"calculated feint\" allowing you to \"make a normal move up to d6 inches\" in the charge phase allow you to re-embark into the repulsor if charged and the repulsor isn't in engagement range?\n\nTo my understanding the only restriction would be that you can't disembark and embark in the same phase. Meaning disembarking during movement and re-embarking if charged should work.",
            "With the new indirect fire making 1 2 3 always miss can voice of command overwrite that and make them hit on threes?",
            "\nNew to the hobby. \nSo with the new balance changes\u2026 is there a new physical codex book coming out? \nAnd how do balance changes in general work as far as already having the printed codexes. Are you just supposed to scribble in the changes with a marker or what?",
            "Is it worth it to use a land raider crusader to transport calgar, 6 aggressors, and a biologis? Or should I build the land raider as a redeemer, and have the calgar squad travel on foot?",

            "Can new Custodes be made anymore? I remember reading somewhere that they are each personally made by the emperor, and with him being stuck on the golden throne, does that mean Custodes are a finite faction with no possibility of replenishing losses while the emperor is seated on Terra?",
            "I\u2019m new to the game, trying to build a 1k point kist for Space Marines.  I want to build an infantry focused infiltration force, with light mechanized support. So far I have assault intercessors with lieutenant as my main infantry to go up the middle. I have eliminators with bolt rifles to provide support to my infantry and character sniping, with a Phobos captain for shoot/move/survivability, and infiltrators to work as infantry and provide control abilities. I think I\u2019m going to use hell blasters for heavy/armor support, and use some kind of transport to move them. \n\nWould anyone be able to tell me if what I\u2019m doing makes any sense, or what other units would compliment this play style? I was thinking a whirlwind for indirect fire support, maybe scouts for more infiltration and generally good stats for the price, maybe a repulsive for transport and infantry support when disembarked, maybe Marnius Calgar to go with the assault intercessors for better melee support. \n\nIdk if this makes sense or if I\u2019m dumb.",
            "How old is the land raider model? I\u2019m building it and can tell it\u2019s an old model. Just how old is it?",
            "Are there any rules on what edition of miniatures are allowed or accepted in most cases? The reason am asking is because I played 40k way back in the 90s and have a bunch of old Eldar minis that I don't know if I can use anymore. Some are ancient, like Howling Banshees with las pistols, but the ones I'm mostly wondering about are Wraithguard ( the old metal ones with a head you stuck on ) and some weapon platforms ( the version where the guardian is standing on the platform, not sitting like the new ones look ).",
            "Do you mean a Pactbound Zealot list?\n\nBecause you can't do what you're suggesting:\n\n> a CHARACTER can only be attached to a unit if both units share the same keyword from the above list.\n\nA SLAANESH Character can't lead a KHORNE unit unless it also has the KHORNE keyword, and the Marks rule doesn't allow you to pick multiple MARKS.",
            "Well, you're giving two wildly different examples that have different answers.\n\nOath of Moment permits you to you reroll the hit roll ***each time you make an attack***.  Note that even if you are Fast Dice Rolling, your 20 attacks you make with your Hellblasters (for instance) don't turn into \"one attack\".  You're simply rolling 20 attack's Hit and Wound rolls, simultaneously.  They are still 20 ***separate*** attacks.  \n\nBecause it says \"each time you make an attack that targets the Oath of Moment target, you ***can*** reroll the hit roll\" (paraphrasing), you can reroll just the misses, or you can reroll the hits as well (such as if you are fishing for Lethal Hits).  Assuming the example Hellblasters are targeting the OoM selection, EACH attack can trigger the reroll, because the rule kicks in EACH time you make an attack.\n\nCommand Reroll is different: you use it after you have made one of the types of rolls it says it allows.  If a rule tells you to reroll a specific \"Roll\", you roll the same number of dice you normally would for that roll.  So, for example, if you had a weapon that does 2d3 shots, you would roll 2d3 dice if you reroll the random number of attacks via Command Roll.  But you'd only get a single Hit roll reroll, even if you have other attacks, for exanple",
            "Probably not as Combat Patrol is balanced independently. Aeldari still get 12 fate dice in Combat Patrol, even though it's been nerfed to 6 in tabletop.",
            "It's hard to tell what hyperlink you are hovering over in what rules section.  For example, I'm 9e Crusade rules, Named Characters receive the predetermined Warlord trait automatically.  If you're on the Crusade Rules page (which I believe you might be), these games have different rules than the core rules of 9e",
            "Reading 10th Ed Indices, I've only narrowed it down to 10 factions:\n\nSpace Marines\n\n* Grey Knights (Teleport Strike Force) - Teleportation is bar none my favourite form of movement in pretty much any game I've ever played, and these guys do it more than Deathwatch. These guys seem glassy, and I'm not sure if they're cannon-y, but I'm a SUCKER for teleportation. I heard its more than likely GN are getting model updates this year?\n* Space Wolves (Champions of Russ) - Though vikings aren't the first aesthetic I gravitate to, the Sagas and enhancements look like a TON of fun with flexibility. The wolves they can ride give lots of mobility! They seem like a blast to play.\n* Deathwatch (Black Spear Task Force) - Seem pretty simple if not a bit boring. I really like the different ammunitions, as well as teleportarium obviously. Maybe just seems too combat focused? \n\nImperium\n\n* Adepta Sororitas (Hallowed Martyrs) - I guess this one is obvious; The mechanic Acts of Faith gives, like in Castles of Burgundy, is one I LOVE in games. Blood of Martyrs, Light of the emperor, rejoice the fallen all seem like a lot of fun! Flexibility/adaptability from Triumph of St Catherine.  Even with today's nerf they look like a blast with consistent outcomes.\n\nChaos\n\n* Chaos Daemons (Daemonic Incursion) - I think this is in my top 3 so far. Warp rifts sing to me. The strategic ploy strategems may be my fave out of those I can remember. Tzeentch Legiones Daemonica seem like perfect units, especially w/ Everstave. The Army rules of Daemonic Manifestation and Daemonic Terror are the kind of things I like in that they increase my 'moat' of safety\n* Thousand Sons (Cult of Magic) \u2013I really like the adaptability that comes with Cabal Points. Likely with some Tzeentch Legiones Daemonica, even if they lose out on Kindred Sorcery. An auto-save may be my fave kind of defensive ability, assuming its for a clutch model. The strategems which add range, ignore cover/indirect fire, and especially Ensorcelled Infusion, seem to allow for fun/interesting combos.\n\nXenos\n\n* Aeldari (Battle Host) \u2013 Fate Dice, obviously. Exactly what I\u2019m looking for. Possible combos with Drukhari or Harlequins seem like a LOT of fun. Matchless Agility, Fire & Fade, and Feigned Retreat are way up my alley. Amazing mobile unit options!\n* Drukhari (Realspace Raiders) \u2013 Super fast units. I wish there was at least one more option for ways to spend pain tokens though.\n* Necrons (Canoptek Court, despite today\u2019s nerfs) \u2013 Those re-rolls are my dream, man. Though seems like Necron are a bit of a meme right now?\n* T\u2019Au (Kauyon) \u2013 Today\u2019s buffs/changes hugely increase their variability. Super high range and high mobility make this one another strong contender for having a playstyle I\u2019d really enjoy. I like the Strike and Fade stratagem. The observer mechanic seems really cool if not a lot of work for what it brings in return. I have a feeling they\u2019d get smoked by objective-grabbing hordes though. This one has the bonus of being a faction my spouse would want to play. These guys appeal to me so much more than Knights and I can\u2019t figure out why.\n\nI guess since I've listed so many, maybe cost should be a factor as well, haha.  \n  \nI\u2019m likely overvaluing some here, and ignoring others I might really prefer. Please send help!",
            "Rules as written, that is correct, though many people get their panties in a twist arguing that that isn't correct somehow, such as arguing that the rules say to treat a Crusader Squad as one of the units on the list (even though nothing says that).",
            ">With the Repulsor update I believe 6 Eradicators and an attached Gravis Captain will fit in a 14 capacity Repulsor.\n\nCorrect.\n\n>Can the Vanguard Spearhead stratagem \"calculated feint\" allowing you to \"make a normal move up to d6 inches\" in the charge phase allow you to re-embark into the repulsor if charged and the repulsor isn't in engagement range?\n\nCorrect, and this is even addressed in the Transport section of the Rules Commentary/FAQ document released yesterday, page 11, Transports section, bottom of the page.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w65uwxjirx7d1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=46e60c682863d071df3e213852483a88c1b31333",
            "Exact opposite of an expert here, but the way they wrote that change makes it sound like you should treat a 3- in that situation as if it were an unmodified 1, i.e., always fails every time.",
            "Nope.  \"unmodified 1-3 always fails\" means it doesn't matter what bonuses you have, either to your BS, or hit rolls.",
            "\"Codex\" means \"rule book specifically for a single army faction\".  GW has never reprinted codices nor the core rulebook within an edition just to include balance changes, as the balance changes are considered optional, and despite what you see on Reddit, there is a very large number of players who will literally have no idea anything happened yesterday for months.\n\n>And how do balance changes in general work as far as already having the printed codexes. Are you just supposed to scribble in the changes with a marker or what?\n\nIf you use a physical codex for some reason, you can either print out the single page of rules from the Balance Dataslate that handles your faction's rule changes, or whatever you feel you need to do.  The vast majority will use the 40k app if they have the physical codex because that gets updated automatically, you get a code for it when you buy a physical codex and frankly works faster than people flipping through 30+ pages of datasheets that are irrelevant to the army they are playing.  \n\nI know that sounds crass but every single game Ive played in 10e that has gone 3+ hours while not getting to round 5, has been with people who insist on using the physical books to look up their rules, or are flipping through 18+ page Battlescribe printouts because they don't configure the printout to not repeat army rules on every datasheet, etc.",
            "I like having Calgar on foot, Redeemer is great if you plan on bringing in an Erad + biologist combo instead.   \nHaving Calgar with the dudes outside frees up some points to add another threat that your opponent will have to deal with in the table.",
            "I don't use the magnifying ring - I have a pair of glasses and use several other lights (I find it helps with shadows a bit better, and there's a smaller area of vision magnified, so less effort needed to get out of the magnified view.  It also has different levels of magnification I can switch to. \n\nBut totally, yes, trying to paint without it would drive me crazy, now that I've got it!",
            "They make new Custodes in his stead, but they might not be as stable/potent.",
            "Yes, more can be made.  While the Emperor was involved personally with the creation of the original custodes, the \"personally made by the emperor\" has been a \"he personally created the process that creates custodes\" and not \"literally he made each and every single one from start to finish.",
            "It's at least from 2009, as I've been able to find a Chaos Land Raider unboxing from then, and it's the same kit with Chaos weapons sprue swapped.",
            "When using old models in tournament settings, there are a few things you should think about:\n- Is the model around the same size as the current model?\n- Is the model on the same base size that the current model is sold with?\n- Does the model have a legal loadout for the current rules?\n\nTaking Howling Banshees as an example, the model's height doesn't seem to have changed much, and laspistols look very similar to shuriken pistols so that shouldn't be an issue. The kit is currently sold with 28.5mm bases, so you may need to rebase them if yours are on smaller bases.\n\nOutside of tournament play, just ask your opponent. For me personally, if someone said, \"Hey, I have some old Howling Banshees I wanna play with, but they're only on 25mm bases, is that okay?\" then I'd have zero issues.",
            "Right, got too excited about what I wanted to do, and forgot to check if it was possible in the first place.",
            "Sorry for the different examples, I played my first game yesterday and had this instance occurred, anyway thanks for the explenation, basically OoM is for each attack, CR is for the whole roll",
            "Yes but from my understanding if not specified the core rules still apply for Combat patrol.\n\nSo unless in the Combat patrol rules it specifies that this Stratagem can still be used multiple times the core rule limitation should apply.\n\nOther changes like for example the change to the Tank Shock Stratagem will also apply and have a Impact for example on my Space Wolves as the tank shock is now a lot weaker ( 8 Dice instead of 16 so basically only half the damage output).",
            "Aah! The app. I always forget everything is on there. Thanks! This helped me out",
            "When I first got it, I rarely used it.   It was hard to.    Now I can\u2019t live without magnification",
            "The size thing was the item most concerning about the Wrathguard. Everything is HUGE now. I've got the old Avatar of Khain model and that thing is barely bigger than a Terminator now.\n\nFrom what you're saying, base sizes are very important. Is the 28.5 base the standard for an average trooper? I recently painted up a small horde of Rangers and Banshees ( I think they're the 2nd version where they actually have shuriken pistols ) but I didn't do anything with the bases. If they're the smaller bases could I just glue them, base and all,  onto the bigger size instead of having to completely remove the bases they're on and redo them?",
            "Yes, and note that \"whole roll\" does not mean \"20 attack rolls I rolled simultaneously\" but \"ONE of the 20 attack rolls I rolled simultaneously\".",
            ">Is the 28.5 base the standard for an average trooper?\n\nFor Aeldari, yes, it looks like all the new infantry sculpts are on 28.5mm bases. Notably, some aspects like Fire Dragons and Warp Spiders haven't received new models yet, and they're still on 25mm. If you go to the Warhammer webstore listing for a unit, scroll down and expand the description, it should tell you the base size, but some don't.\n\n>Could I just glue them, base and all, onto the bigger size?\n\nYou could, although I can't say I've seen this before. The \"double-step\" it would give you might look a bit strange. It shouldn't be too hard to slide a hobby knife underneath the feet and separate from the base. Alternatively, if you google something like \"40k bases 25 to 28\" you can find plastic rings designed to slide on top of the tapered base edge and expand them to the correct size.\n\n>The size thing was the item most concerning about the Wraithguard\n\nLooks like the new ones are on 40mm bases, and they're a little taller. It will be very rare that you'll play a game and your Wraithguard will end up behind a terrain feature that is only just tall enough to conceal the old model, but not the new model. If you do find yourself in this situation, be aware that the models should be a little taller than they appear. For casual games I wouldn't worry.",
            "https://preview.redd.it/fyksf2l2er7d1.jpeg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68822f2d143b8df430d4119573ac9bd5dc1aa210",
            "That's the reason why I'm having such issues trying to see if my minis are still usable because some are updated, some aren't, and finding information on what model goes on what base is so random. I found a few different resources on the interwebs but I never know what is official and what isn't. I'm not interested in playing tournies because this is just a fun little game ( woo, mean screamy elf lady go brrrr! ) to me but I wanna make sure that I'm conforming to the rules.\n\nJust the fact that Warp Spiders ( the unit that got me into Warhammer when I saw a game being played back in like, 1994 or so ) are fairly chunky models but are on a smaller base than a standard guardian is so weird to me. I've also got the original Jain Zar and Maugan Ra which are TIIIINY compared to their new models. It's like \"Don't talk to me or my son/daughter ever again\".\n\nThanks for the head's up on the base slider thingies. I really don't want to remove my painted models because they're on decorated bases and would really not want to redo it.\n\nThank you for the information. Was very helpful. Much appreciated. Now if GW would figure out if they're removing Slaanesh or not!"
