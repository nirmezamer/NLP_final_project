            "Hey! I hope this message finds you in great spirits. I\u2019m reaching out to you today to share that I\u2019m on the lookout for a Loyal, Dedicated and Honest accountability partner to join me on my MCAT preparation journey. I'm specifically seeking someone who is genuinely enthusiastic towards learning \u2013 and someone who's not just willing to study,  but is also a little excited about the chance to dive into this MCAT process and improve slowly but gradually, with me alongside them learning and encouraging them along the way - and vice versa. I envision a collaborative environment where we can motivate each other to Grow -  keeping each other accountable and celebrating our small successes together as we work towards achieving our 2024 MCAT study goals. If you're passionate about helping each other grow and succeed, I'd love to connect and explore how we can support each other on this challenging yet incredibly rewarding path to medical school. Let's make this journey memorable and impactful together! Below is all my info: \n* Location: Delaware, United States.  \n* Test Date (Anticipated): Initially 4/13/2024 but rescheduling to 9/14/2024. \n* MCAT Prep Material: e.g. all Kaplan books with all AAMC online material, I also do about 30 Q-Bank questions a day on Kaplan\u2019s website, and try to follow their schedule. Currently saving up for U-World. Also currently enrolled in a MCAT class and recently just downloaded Anki. \n* Online/In-Person/Both/No-Preference: Online, preferably FaceTime or Zoom. \n* Stage of studying/study plan: Recently took a Practice FL, or a diagnostic rather, and did decently on it considering I haven\u2019t finished taking Biochemistry at my university, nor have I finished the Physics 2 course. I am currently challenging myself to sit down and study for at least 6h daily on weekdays outside of class, and 2x that time on weekend days. I also have that MCAT prep class pretty much daily for 3h, but I have mandatory classes on Sundays for 4h. I have a google calendar that I follow rigidly and that is essentially my life. I can share that with you to create a feasible study plan for both of us. \n* Goal of a Study Buddy: My biggest goal is for us to keep each other accountable and ACTUALLY meet on a weekly basis based on our schedules in order to actively learn together via practice quizzes, test modes, debating content review ideas that we come across in order to learn via teaching, and share overall tips and mnemonics that we learned as we individually studied. If you are okay with it, I am cool with keeping an organized draft of google docs via email, this way, we we can use spreadsheets to keep track of hours studied and content reviewed daily \u2014 as a added accountability and extra resource guide where we combine notes, etc. These are all just ideas,  though. Tbh, I can help a lot with the organization part. The biggest thing for me is finding someone who is willing and ready to just SHOW UP CONSISTENTLY, and is diligent because they want to be, and not because I\u2019m forcing them to be. Keeping each other accountable can only work if both parties are ready to put in the work. I\u2019m ready to hold you accountable but you have to reciprocate. I\u2019m also ready to get a great score. Are you serious about getting a great score too? \n* Goal Score and Realistic Score: 520+ dream score, 517 target score.\n* Other obligations: I\u2019m currently a full time Neuroscience student, but like I said, I have a very strict schedule that I truly live by. Within this schedule, I have budgeted over 45 hours of study time outside of class time. This is for my core class that I\u2019m taking in school right now. However, I have an additional 28-35 Targeted hours of MCAT practice and studies outside of class as well. Most of my classes are Biochem and Physics oriented, so I am flexible with which content to review and study on which days. I also have other obligations, but these can be worked around. I prefer if you have a google calendar that is already organized and set, or something of a list of sorts, so that we can compare schedules easily. Thanks! \n* Random Information: I\u2019m a 26F, non-traditional senior with degrees in interpersonal communication and neuroscience. I am a \u2018foreigner\u2019 as I immigrated here from an african country about 10 years ago, but I consider myself very much american. i graduate in may. I do research at a bio-chem lab. I used to be a night owl until end of 2023 when I totally adjusted my goals and mindset, and now I wake up by 6am daily but I want to start waking up at 5am because that is when my cortisol levels are the highest and I can maybe get some studying In before the day starts ? But thats a work in progress. I\u2019m super precise and well known for my daily fashion choices haha and this is a fun part of me that has become my \"niche\"! What about you ?

I need someone who can text me and say, \"Did you do your anki today?\". I am also looking for someone who can relate to this and have an idea of what it is like to go through the studying! I had no one to really empathize with the first time, and I think that did not help my well-being.

I work with doctors, residents, and medical students every day, and they are such an inspiration to me! It also rubs off a bit to be in the ED.

        "content": "I just wanted to come back to this thread and say that anything is possible. I got rude comments on my post excited about being accepted into medical school 2 years ago where I mentioned I got into medical school w a 490. While some were positive others were disgusting and really negative. Saying I won\u2019t make it past boards, I\u2019ll fail out of school etc etc etc. Honestly I laughed at some then others I was just thought to myself you know what? A SCORE DOES NOT DEFINE YOU! I\u2019m not telling anyone to apply w low MCAT scores whatsoever. I\u2019m just saying that if you do get into medical school with a low score do not let it define you because your medical school didn\u2019t let it define you. \n\nI didn\u2019t have the right balance nor did I have the resources to take the exam MCAT. I come from a low income family who could not support me (even though they tried their best) and I just tried my best to study with what I had. When coming into medical school I had to let go of what I did previously to get in and grinded like I knew I could. With refunds and school resources I was able to afford and get resources to help support me through school like ALL other students. I was able to use them to level up my study habits as well as use different techniques w/o worrying about $! I just say this to say don\u2019t let a score define you and keep grinding to reach your dream. I\u2019m done w didactics and honored in some of my courses (\ud83d\udd95to the naysayers that said I couldn\u2019t). I love winning and proving haters wrong. Now I am a M3 and ready to take on Clinicals! If you\u2019re reading this know you are good enough and will. Reach your dreams!\n\n- The Person with the 490",

My old test didn\u2019t have a code on it to be distributed to schools electronically so I took the mcat again 1/26/24. I got a 490. I am applying to Aacomas with that score. I am also studying to take it again soon. I have a few waiver because of my student loan debt. But if someone gave me an A I would be thrilled. I keep wondering how this below average score might correlate to a P/ Fail? I think I would pass step 1 ; I did that in 2004. But the comlex? Is that score pass/ fail or is scored?",

I hope that you\u2019ll be a great doctor.\n\nBut we do have to recognize that there is a trend with higher gpa and mcat scores with higher chances of acceptance. Hope is good to have, but we all have to be realistic about our chances because some schools do screen scores. \n\nI think it\u2019s getting more and more competitive to even get a spot even with great scores ngl as years go by.",

            "Thank You!! It\u2019ll all work out! Make sure to take practice exams and fill in your weak areas w free resources like Kahn Academy & YouTube! If you have the funds get UWorld and learn from those questions to also fill in gaps. Use Anki if you can for the psych/soc and understanding. As for bio write out pathways and understand the underlying physio of what\u2019s going on. After you know the physiology you can use it to your advantage of being able to answer questions. After studying for boards I know for a fact I went about studying for MCAT totally wrong which showed in my MCAT score but not in intellect. You got this just keep pushing! I believe in you!",

            "I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re going off your username to be this way but I promise the MCAT is just a weed out tool because when it comes to actual course work and passing exams some of the ppl with 520s are failing while others who made lower scores are top of the class.

            "You\u2019re actually contributing to a false sense of security and misguiding people by sharing your 1 in 10,000 story (essentially bullshit). Especially while conveniently ignoring every other aspect of your app, especially your school.",
            "Spot on about the sarcasm.\n\nJokes aside, at the same time, there's no denying the MCAT gives an indication of how strong your foundation is. You mentioned reinventing yourself during medical school, which was an extra hill to climb but you managed to pull it off. Meanwhile, most people who got your score would have flunked out of medical school by now. I know a guy who got a 502 and is on the verge of flunking out.",
            "That\u2019s not the reality in all honestly. Classmates who did not make it to 3rd year were the ones w 500+. I think people get complacent and think that what they had coming in will make them ok for coursework and keep their same habits when it doesn\u2019t. You have to revamp your skills to study in medical school and some are resistant to change. I was all for it and it worked. Like I also said in my post I\u2019m sure there are some who took the MCAT like myself and just were fucked bec they couldn\u2019t afford the resources but are excelling now bec of a leveled playing field w having access to get more resources.",
            "\"Classmates who did not make it to 3rd year were the ones w 500+\" Try to remember very few people get into medical school with a sub-500 score, especially MD schools, so that's not really a valid statement. Let me ask you this: if there was one year where where 50% of matriculants had a 500+ and the other had a sub-500, do you think the sub-500 group would not see a substantially higher rate of flunking out?",
            "lol @ the 490 kid also not understanding what anecdotal evidence is. \n\nMy school decided to ignore the MCAT as a metric of importance to level the playing field for people with low scores. Guess who\u2019s failing at my school? Not the 520s. So I guess by your logic, my story cancels yours out?",
            "That's not what I'm arguing! I'm saying in my personal experience at my school. My opinion is not reflective of every medical school in the US! Also l've only loss less than 10 ppl in my class and some boasted abt their mcats and others didn't. They could have also left because of health/other issues unrelated to course work. My post is for those who didn\u2019t do as well as you did. They need to know that they can do this and to start school with a plan because the MCAT does not define what type of physican you'll be.",
            "Proper statistical evidence>>>> anecdotal evidence by a wide margin. I think we can end it here.",
            "You came on my post. You didn\u2019t have to engage but you did. At the end of the day the day still has to end!"

Do practice problems and utilize them and derive them and by practicing that not only will you build intuition to solve these types of problems but you will also memorize the equations."
