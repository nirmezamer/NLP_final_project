            "2024 is probably going to be the best year for superhero animation *ever*. \n\n*Invincible* season 2, *X-Men \u201897*, *My Adventures with Superman* season 2, *Suicide Squad Isekai*, *Batman: Caped Crusader*, *Creature Commandos*, *Eyes of Wakanda* and possibly even *Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man* as well.",
            "[Don\u2019t fuel my \u201cGiancarlo is playing Paladin\u201d theory anymore, the gods are pointing at it](https://x.com/classicmarvel_/status/1804188381376553066?s=46&t=zYcgLaa5LZGq3IgzlBR_wg)",
            "I feel like Avengers 5 is going to be a lot like Infinity War with everything going on. Sam will probably have his earth based team set up at that point (no I do not believe that Alex Perez tweet about Wong coming in to recruit Sam considering it was pretty clear in hindsight that AtlantaFilming was just speculating because Benedict was in Atlanta at the time), with Strange being confirmed his side is coming in as well, Wong has his team with Shang-Chi, Katy, Hulk and Carol.",
            "This might sound weird, but I feel like X-Men \u201897 portrayed Magento too favorably. Done get me wrong, it\u2019s a good portrayal, because a lot of people haven\u2019t watched the original series or read the comics, they\u2019re  forgetting that this man openly calls for genocide on people he deems genetically inferior. He is in no ways a good guy. He\u2019s Hitler if Hitler was created by Hitler and used that as a justification for his genocide. \n\nThe worst thing he does in \u201897 (disabling the power grid) is almost danced over. They don\u2019t deal with the fact that he almost certainly killed millions of innocent people. Every car in the world crashed; every plane fell out of the sky; everybody on life support immediately flatlined; and they just ignore it. So people spout unironically \u201cMagento was right\u201d as if he isn\u2019t completely insane.",
            "Reading Claremont/Cockrum's Uncanny X-Men run for the first time (really loving it). I'm surprised how much I like Banshee. He's the team's glass cannon: easy to take out in a fight, but his sonic blasts have more raw force than any other power on the team (until Phoenix appears).\n\nBanshee also acts as an older, world-weary rogue with a heart-of-gold: unafraid to call out Xavier/Cyclops' bullshit, but willing to die for his friends. This is normally Wolverine's role, but right now he's a trigger-happy psycho everyone hates. I'm guessing Banshee will eventually be written out of the book so Wolverine can grow into his role.\n\nI waffle a lot about wishcasting the MCU X-Men. But I wouldn't be disappointed if they just copied the Uncanny team: Cyclops, Storm, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Banshee, and Wolverine. Really fun dynamic.",
            "I\u2019m sad about Blade no longer being set in the 1920\u2019s. Aside from being a cool aesthetic alongside the alternate universe 60\u2019s of the F4, since seeing the flashback in Eternals, I\u2019ve been very intrigued by the past of the MCU. \n\nHaving Blade set in the 1920\u2019s gave me the impression that they not only set up stuff for the future moving forward but also are building the historical past of the universe.\n\nIt would\u2019ve been cool to see an Eternal or 2 pop up in Blade, a crossover happening before we followed the MCU in the modern world. There was that tidbit about the Eternals having helped the previous Avatar of Khonshu take down Ammit\u2019s last avatar in the past but the idea was scrapped due to budget for Moon Knight. Which imho is unfortunate.",

            "While I enjoyed this season of *Doctor Who*, I can\u2019t help but feel it was too short. 9 episodes (counting the Christmas special) just isn\u2019t enough to get to know this Doctor and Ruby Sunday, compared to past seasons with ~13 episodes. That\u2019s an almost 3 hour difference. \n\nSo is it wrong for me to say that for some shows, I\u2019d rather have ~20 episodes seasons with lots of filler than 8, good episodes? For serialized shows (like Stranger Things) 8 episodes is plenty, but for episodic television like *Doctor Who* and *Star Trek*, 8-10 just isn\u2019t enough.",
            "I hope, with Benedict confirming Strange is in Avengers 5, that Clea also has a decent sized role in the movie. Always liked Clea as a character from the comics, think she\u2019s super cool, and there\u2019s a lot they could do with her. Also Charlize Theron is a great actress and one of the best action stars out there, and it would be weird if we didn\u2019t see her again after the MoM post credit scene.\u00a0",

            "Tough look for Alex Perez, he\u2019s been saying forever that Strange won\u2019t be in Avengers 5 cuz he\u2019ll be off world with Clea. As if Marvel wasn\u2019t gonna have one of, if not their biggest, remaining stars in the next Avengers movie. His credibility drops by the day.\u00a0",
            "If we ever *do* get Harry in the MCU, I think the route they\u2019re going w/ him in the new Ultimate Comics would be perfect for him and Peter.\n\nThe Goblin starting off as a vigilante is a cool way to differentiate him from Dafoe\u2019s version and there could be some great tension from Peter dealing with and potentially befriending a heroic (yet semi-shady) variant of his biggest enemy. It could be a bit like Clark and Lex\u2019s dynamic in *Smallville*.",

            "I do believe that Ali is frustrated with the production of Blade (mainly because a trade literally said he's frustrated with the production of Blade) But I maintain that people saying that the fact he accepted a role in a Jurassic Park movie is a sign that an announcement of him stepping down from the role is an any-day-now thing are wrong.\n\n\nThat'd be like saying that because Chris Pratt got more roles (funnily enough , one of them being another Jurassic Park movie) and did them while they were waiting in that time when they had fired Gunn is a sign that he was ready to step down in solidarity,",

            "One of the dumbest things about post Endgame Marvel is saving the Avengers movies for the end of sagas. I get wanting to get people a break and time to miss those movies, but movies are inevitably delayed and that just turns into multiple years without an Avengers movie. We were supposed to get more Civil War like movies, but since 2018 the only one we got was Spider-Man No Way Home and that was just Dr Strange, so that didn\u2019t happen. A Young Avengers movie would\u2019ve been great. Just something to show there\u2019s a new team or anything before we get to what\u2019s going to be whatever Kang Dynasty is going to become. For me, it\u2019s just really disagreeable planning all around on that front",

            "I wonder how much of characters not showing up as much as RDJ and Evans is due to the actors literally wanting to do/having other projects outside of just the MCU. Not that they don\u2019t like it just to avoid burn out. I know most of it is them for some reason not committing to a core cast but just a thought.",
            "Modern Spider-Man adaptations keep winding up at Ultimate's door, imo is because:\n\n* The OG Ultimate was made when a Marvel under Avi Arad was asking the question: Is it easy to adapt? I don't think 616 was easy to adapt beat for beat, so the cinematic nature of Ultimate lends itself better to being turned into scripts.\n* Whatever came after that aren't exactly up to par given that they were, and are still being made under the \"Is it easy to adapt **for me**?\" mentality adopted by a Marvel led by David Maisel. The for me part is very important.\n* I can't really think of a standout Spider-Man story that is just him and his supporting cast first and foremost in modern day other than Life Story. That's pretty much the trickle down effect caused by Marvel's shifting priorities.",

            "What do y'all think of [this BGR speculation](https://bgr.com/entertainment/im-convinced-that-i-know-when-marvel-will-release-spider-man-4/) that Spider-Man 4 could replace Blade as a Fall 2025 slot?\n\nI remember hearing awhile back that the Spidey 4 script should be getting close to ready, and I can see Sony's push for a quicker release date being a part of negotiations with Marvel. But I also have no idea how reliable BGR is and I haven't been following all this terribly closely",
            "I have a theory for how Cyclops\u2019 Role (played by James Marsden) will be in Deadpool and Wolverine. I actually think he will have a role similar to Lylla in Guardians 3. \n\nSo it was MTTSH (yes I know she\u2019s full of shit but a broken clock can be right twice a day) that said that Cyclops bugs Logan to wear the yellow spandex and Logan does so after Cyclops and the X-Men presumably die.\n\nSimilar to Lylla, I feel like Cyclops will only appear in flashbacks as an emotional core to Logan\u2019s character and, just like Guardians 3, I think we will get flashbacks in the middle of the movie, where it\u2019s with Logan hanging out with Scott and some other X-Men, with Scott having the biggest role out of the X-Men NOT named Wolverine. Well, one flashback shows the aftermath where Wolverine is controlled (probably by Cassandra Nova) to kill all the X-Men (which is where he let his world down) where Scott is like the last one standing. He tells Logan to stop and remember, with maybe an action fight between the two. After the fight and a quick talk with Scott, Logan thinks about it for a second but kills Scott (afterwards he realizes what he\u2019s done cause he\u2019s now free from Cassandra as he has now killed every single X-Men in his universe)",

Just because they aren\u2019t gonna be hanging out at the Avengers Mansion doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t Avengers. The team shouldn\u2019t be this exclusive. \n\n\nYou should be able to be apart of multiple teams Moon Knight can be apart of the Midnight Suns and be an Avenger, Luke Cage can be a Defender as well as an Avenger. Dr Strange while doing shit alone can still be a damn Avenger. Young Avengers, Midnight Suns, Thunderbolts, Defenerds, etc can she their own teams while still being apart of The Avengers. \n\nI guess there can still be a core group if you really want to have that AOU feel but there is simply too many characters now I don\u2019t they will be doing that much if at all.  Everyone will probably be doing their own thing with their own issues until shit really hits the fan. \n\nIt\u2019s all of Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes connected through Earth, Cosmic Side, Supernatural, Street, etc",
            "That Cumberbatch Avengers 5 post already starts with a comment trashing on the current characters \ud83d\ude44",
            "Thinking about Spider-Man 4, one element that has been getting tossed around by scoopers is that Sony wants some multiversal aspect to the film. And a lot of fans want something a bit more street level, with Daredevil and Kingpin etc. Devil's Reign gets brought up a lot. And as others have pointed out, Devil's Reign does have a multiversal element. With Doc Ock summoning alternate versions of himself through the multiverse. \n\nI think they could replicate this aspect with Liz Allan. Not Liz summoning alternate versions of herself through the multiverse. But Liz working for Kingpin on a multiversal gateway. Kingpin wants it for his own uses (maybe he fucks over his family in BA and wants to get them back, idk). But Liz wants it to bring her father back. Hence we get Liz bringing Vulture back into the MCU, and maybe a few other villains. \n\nThe majority of the movie is still about Fisk's mayoral reign and sending his Thunderbolts after vigilantes in the city. But there is still that multiversal element and a machine that can send people through the multiverse, which leads to Avengers 5.",

I'm not sure how to feel about it though with all the allegations surrounding him. I was also surprised Ryan would want to work with him again.",

And what do you think a merged 616 and ultimate X-men, taking the best of both worlds, would be like?

Love the worldbuilding and how they got the look, feel, and esthetic down to a tea, and it actually felt like watching the video game come to live. The characters are also actually very likable. Lucy, especially, is probably my favorite so far, with the Ghoul as a close second. Don't really care much for Maximus and his story though. At least for now anyways, the Brotherhood of Steel stuff is cool, it's just his story I don't find that investing but that's okay. Though the teaser at the end seems to imply all three of there stories will converge at some point, since it seems like there all going after the same thing.\n\nAlso, the opening was honestly extremely well done. So yeah, overall, absolutely love the first episode. Can't wait to watch more.",

            "With F4 being set on a completely separate Earth from the main MCU, I wanted to ask, are there any movies you think should've been set in their own continuity from the main MCU timeline?\n\nPersonally, I always thought it would've been cool and interesting if Eternals was set on its own Earth separate from the 616. With this Earth also consisting of Werewolf By Night, Blade, and maybe even Moonknight. It be good way to explain why those projects feel so disconnected from everything else in the MCU, and Jack, Teddy, Blade, Merc/Steven, Elsa (no, not that Elsa, Bloodstone Elsa),  Lylla (not the otter, the other lylla), and Whitman are already a pretty stellar Midnight Suns lineup on its own, so why not? All that's missing is Johnny Blaze Ghost Rider, played by Nic Cage (not the same one from his movies, though), and we're set.\n\nI also had a pitch for a Nova that was set within a different continuity, mainly the one Defender Strange from MOM comes from. With the movies, basically a Top Gun Maverick inspired story about an older Richard Rider training a young Sam Alexander, with flashbacks that are essentially an origin story for Young Richard Rider. The reason for this is because there are no hints that any Nova Corps survived the Xander attack or if Richard Rider even exists in 616, and much like with F4, it be nice worldbuilding for the Multiverse.\n\nFinally, I'd love to see a D+ that's essentially a The Boys inspired loose adaptation of the Ultimates. Now, that would be epic. But, what do you all think?",

The new writer for the movie is Pearson, a Marvel in-house writer who has worked on a ton of their recent projects. Thats all stuff confirmed by trades. Meanwhile, some rumors suggest Green, who was writing the script, is now writing Midnight Sons for Marvel, which is supposedly connected to Blade. \n\nTo me, it looks like a decision has been made NOT to make Blade a standalone movie and to connect it to other projects going forward. If Ali leaves, I don't think it actually impacts the project that much. It's not like the creatives are there because of him. Ali's handpicked director is gone, and Marvel's new favorite is working on the script. If Ali walks away, Marvel probably forges ahead with the team they have.

If everyone present in Endgame, for instance, is an Avenger now, then what\u2019s the point?\n\nAlso, like another person said, Marvel already has a tendency to homogenize characters to make them fit. Up to this point, the MCU is actually the Avengers Cinematic Universe and Marvel has so much more and different to offer than make every character fit that bill, even if just by name\n\n>I guess there can still be a core group if you really want to have that AOU feel but there is simply too many characters now I don\u2019t they will be doing that much if at all.\n\nI don\u2019t know man; for me, this is the entire appeal of a team dynamic, especially the Avengers. Unlike the other Marvel teams these people come together from damn near their own universes and part of the point of that is to see how they bounce off each other. \n\n\nMaking Avengers movies exclusively \u201clook at how many fucking actors we have!!!\u201d is only going to go so far when it comes to satisfying interactions",

At the same time, having just a ton of different characters and perspectives, exploring all corners of the MCU in one movie sounds insanely cool too. I think a balance of both would be perfect. Although for Avengers 5 it's definitely far to late to have this core team.",
            "I think it's a bad idea. A very common criticism when it comes to the MCU adapting characters who aren't associated with the Avengers is that they're forcing them to fit that Avengers-shaped mould. For many, it's a \"square peg in a round hole\" kind of situation. Fans of other characters/teams/corners also don't like it when Marvel indicates the Avengers are higher priority than their favorites. In the comics, there's no hierarchy and it's a very loose, decentralized universe. There's room for alternate continuities like Ultimates or out-of-continuity stuff like MAX and Epic.\n\nSo far, this is not the case with the MCU.\n\nSo, going back to your *Justice League: Unlimited* example, imagine if DC said, \"Justice League is the *only* DC you will ever get.\" No Vertigo, no *Watchmen*, nothing like that. Yes, I realize DC has hamfistedly forced *Watchmen* into its regular superhero line and Vertigo has always had some overlap, but there's still some *very* out-of-continuity, out-of-the-mainstream stuff there.\n\nI think, if Marvel were to double-down on the Avengers being the end-all-be-all, it would feel less like a universe full of exciting possibilities and more like one of frustrating limitations.\n\nEDIT: Actually, that point about DC forcing *Watchmen* into its regular line is EXACTLY the same concern people have with Marvel and its Avengers.",

I read that one and immediately exited out.\n\nUsing She Hulk and Carol as examples of characters people don\u2019t care about seems a little unfair considering the hate campaigns against them that often dominate online discussions.

            "I\u2019m considering watching this. After my X-Men 97 high, I was wrestling with the fact that I hadn\u2019t seen the last few Fox X-Men movies.\u00a0\n\nMe? A lifelong X-Men fan has skipped several live-action films? How could I truly let this be? Sure, the reviews had turned me away but I love the X-Men and have to see for myself.\u00a0\n\n15 minutes into Dark Phoenix, I was rudely reminded of why I had abandoned the Fox X-Men universe, with few exceptions. There\u2019s a lot that feels off but the way Mystique takes center stage is just bizarre as a longtime fan. Primarily because it doesn\u2019t feel natural to the story, rather you can tell it\u2019s a star power thing.\n\nSo is Apocalypse better?",
            "Some action scenes were really cool (especially the Quicksilver scene) and some of the performances were pretty strong, Fassbender\u2019s being my favorite.\n\nMy big issue that the movie felt unfocused. I like when the X-Men don\u2019t have a *sole* lead, but it felt like many of the arcs didn\u2019t get much time to cook or get enough focus to feel satisfying. A lot of the time it feels like they\u2019re fighting for screentime (still think the Weapon X plot was unneeded).\n\nI will say though, there were some neat brief character moments like Kurt praying for Alex or Peter joking with the others on the plane or the deleted scenes with the young cast at the mall.",
            "The action scenes where amazing in this movie especially the magneto awakening one",
            "EVERYTHING THEY BUILT WILL FALL!",
            "- Wolverine should\u2019ve been one of the Horsemen and that\u2019s how he gets the adamantium and comic suit/ mask in the new timeline.\nMaking him the product of the Stryker\u2019s Weapon X program again fucks the significance of Stryker not being Stryker at the end of DoFP.\n\n- Giving the X-Men black armor that they randomly found at Alkali Lake was a braindead move. The movie was made in fucking 2016. They conveniently found a fancy black jet to go along with them too. \nThey should\u2019ve found a way to have them wear the comic suits from the end earlier in the film.\n\n- Apocalypse was too big a threat for newbie X-Men in the 1980s. \n\n- I love that we got back to back X-Men films with musical continuity.\n\n- This was somehow a better Mummy movie than the one that came the following year staring tom cruise",
            "This movie had so much potential and they fucked it up. The way Wolverine was included really pissed me the fuck off. Why even bother with the little tease of Mystique as Stryker at the end of DOFP? Obviously, the implication was new timeline, new rules. \n\nApocalypse should\u2019ve been the one that gave him the adamantium in this timeline. He didn\u2019t even need to be a major character, just a horseman, handled with meticulous care to ensure he\u2019s respected, but ensuring that the new characters get a chance to shine.",
            "This movie is rubbish, but has a couple of aspects that bring it up from F tier for me. \n\nMichael Fassbender is incredible, even if his story feels recycled. \n\nThe Quicksilver scene is fun but suffers from crazy tonal whiplash given that Havok dies in that scene. \n\nApocalypse is bad, though not as bad as Vuk. No villain is as bad as Vuk. \n\nThe best scene is the Wolverine scene, but it doesn\u2019t make any sense with the ending of DOFP and that whole section of the movie feels inconsequential and out of no where.",
            "the horsemen should have been first class members so basically magneto, mystique, beast and alex summers\n\nI get angel is a known horseman but he's barely developed here I'd rather have him join the team",
            "There's a scene in this where magneto psychically talks to Charles and in the background Apocalypse is using his powers to put armor on archangel, full body, while psylocke stands next to him without pants. The movie has the worst costuming in the franchise the biggest issue of course being Apocalypse himself.\u00a0 Sort of an ugly sonic situation:\u00a0 everyone told them it was bad when it was revealed but they went ahead with it any way. The movie continues the worst I clinations of the franchise which is to include X-Men characters as like a checklist but without actually including anything meaningful about their characters or personalities.\u00a0 It's especially sad when it comes to nightcrawler, who actually does look great in this, but can't come close to matching the heart alan cumming brought to the role.",
            "Uh. Jean uses the whole Phoenix thing against Apocalypse at the end, but in the next film, she dosen't seem have any of that going on until the incident with the space shuttle? Uh, ok.",
            "The biggest injustice this movie does to Apocalypse is that it makes him the first major villain a bunch of novice X-Men successfully fight back and win against. Apocalypse is literally the kind of villain that would bring together the mutant community regardless of perspective against due to his sheer power and influence. He has the ability to essentially transmute every atom in his body at will to give himself basically any ability he can imagine, he converts vulnerable mutants into his underlings in order to exercise his \"the strong willed will survive\" philosophy, and he can also interface with practically any piece of technology at his disposal with technopathy that's way stronger than the likes of Cable or Bastion\n\nThe fact that a bunch of teenagers are able to just punch him to death on their first try is such a criminal disservice to the prominence his comics counterpart would command to mutants. He is their Thanos in a lot of ways, arguably even more imposing\n\nAnd that's only one problem with this movie. It's actually baffling they took the time to use First Class as a way to address a lot of the character building and interpersonal dynamics of X-Men stories that were left out of the initial trilogy, only to hire back the guy responsible for doing away with that very personally-driven drama aspect of the books and essentally regress the films back to being a very surface level political drama with extreme emphasis on one or two characters over an ensemble, in this case Xavier and Mystique. X-Men just didn't mature in a time where all of its contemporaries learned not to treat their audience like they were too inept to understand comics and their complexities. There was one potentially really good scene on the table with Cyclops, Jean and Jubilee going to the movie theater and the arcade, establishing a really cool character moment of mutants just having fun doing things that teens do, and of course THAT was what they chose to scrap",
            "Oh man this movie is wack, Apocalypse is a boring villain, the writing is not that great, so many recognizable Mutants gets wasted especially Psylocke, and the story is so cookie cutter.\nHeck I don\u2019t even liked the casting of Jean since it just the actress didn\u2019t feel right for the role.",
            "This movie is the second worst thing associated with Bryan Singer.",
            "it still bothers me that quiksilver didnt tell magneto he is his son",
            "Evan Peters is thr 1 thing I enjoyed.",
            "[deleted]",
            "I liked two things:  \n1) Xavier accepting Jean's powers instead of blocking them.  \n2) Jean going full Phoenix with fiery raptor.  \nEverything else was average.",
            "Erik turning in as a good guy first in \"Days of Future Past\" then retconning it in the same movie, then saying he turned in again as a good guy just to get his family killed off so he could then be manipulated into joining Apocalypse. What did he even do alongside Apocalypse? The only thing I remember was when Apocalypse went way out of line and out of nowhere he suddenly becomes the good guy again. THAT IS THE ONLY SEQUENCE WHERE HE'S SHOWN PLAYING HIS CHARACTER.   \nNot much of an appealing movie for me.",
            "This is such an average movie, the pacing and the action scenes make it a fun watch and the third act is really entertaining but script and the whole storytelling itself is just bad imo.",
            "I didn't like how horsemans got beaten, I think they got beaten very easily. Just look at the black order in infinity war, they had very good fight scenes and didn't get easily beat after a few minutes.",
            "You had ONE JOB, Fox.\n\nSaoirse Ronan and Elle Fanning were presented on a silver platter, and you cast Sophie Turner.\n\nSuch a shame that now Ronan apparently has closed the door forever for Marvel.",
            "This is a weird movie. It has some truly brilliant moments. I mean like peak Fox X Men stuff. Quicksilver scenes, the absolutely incredible Magneto in the forest scene, the concentration camp scene, Archangel\u2019s birth, the opening action scene, the Weapon X scene, etc. It\u2019s all absolutely incredible stuff\u2026.\n\nbut the movie is just\u2026. not great. it\u2019s like a collection of S-Tier scenes wrapped up in a D or C-tier movie.",
            "This movie has some truly brilliant moments and standout performances, especially from characters like Quicksilver and Magneto. However, it leans heavily on powers, CGI, and action, overshadowing the elements that make X-Men comics compelling\u2014character depth, personal relationships, and drama. The casting choices were generally strong and added depth to the film. However, Bryan Singer's approach to the source material was questionable; he seemed to disregard established character arcs in favor of his own vision, likely in an attempt to appeal to a wider audience. There are multitudes of iconic panels from the comics they could have lifted to adapt into iconic scenes, but they chose to ignore them all. While certain elements, like the swift dispatch of Apocalypse, felt rushed and unsatisfying, there were still memorable moments such as Quicksilver's slomo rescues, Archangel's transformation, Wolverine's cameo, and Magneto's revenge. I also appreciated Psylocke's moment and the great casting choice of Olivia Munn, who was invested in the character's backstory from the comics. However, I wished she had a larger role and joined the team, leaving her feeling underdeveloped and underutilized. Additionally, Jean Grey's transformation into the Phoenix offered a tantalizing glimpse into her power, but the buildup in 'Apocalypse' was undermined by the subsequent 'Dark Phoenix' film. Overall, while 'X-Men: Apocalypse' had its highlights, it fell short of fully honoring the rich source material, resulting in an average superhero film that lacked substance and left me feeling indifferent, and Singer's legacy tarnishes it heavily.",
            "This movie feels like a parody of the Avengers, down to the cheesy \"next time on...\" ending that is meant to make you leave happy, except the movie is so overly long that it is more like a \"THANK GOD\"",
            "Lol! The costumes at the end have a very \"assembled in a day, use once and throw away\" look to them.\u00a0",
            "This was the first one with the new cast in which they all looked like they would rather be somewhere else.   Jennifer Lawrence didn't even stay in character in the last act.",
            "Ive always thought if they actually launched even 1 or 2 of the nukes, it would be so much easier to connect Logan and Deadpool movies and create an actual AoA cinematic universe.",
            "Absolutely the most atrocious in a series of atrocious movies. Here's hoping the MCU can fix what Fox broke.",
            "I left the theater so angry.",
            "It's fun this sub is doing a rewatch but why the Fox films? This is a Marvel Studios subreddit.",
            "It's disgustingly bad, it misunderstands pretty much everything about the source material and everything about these characters we've established over the last chunk of films\n\nI'm trying to think of if it has anything good in it. The best scene in the movie is just a rehash of something great about the last film so I can't even count that. I think the only thing I actively enjoy in that film is this portrayal of Nightcrawler. I think he was cast well, even though he got nothing to do. \n\nAtleast the next movie has that anim\u00e9 ass fight scene on the train where they just wreck SHIT up.",
            "If you watch the Fox X-Men movies in chronological order beginning with First Class, the emphasis on Mystique makes sense. They chose to highlight her and build her character early on. Whether they should have gone down that road is up for debate. But I would think if you watch them then you would understand her character in Dark Phoenix.\n\n\nApocalypse was better to me because the big bad was closer to the comics than the random alien species villains in Dark Phoenix. Dark Phoenix was also originally planned to be two films, but the acquisition by Disney forced them to push it out. It hurt the storyline from the villains, to Quicksilver being sidelined due to scheduling conflicts. Behind the scenes Dark Phoenix was a shit show. The only likeable part of the film for me was the train scene.\n\n\nAll that to say, still don't expect Apocalypse being much better. It's basically passable when compared to other entries in the series.\n\n\nStill nowhere close to X2 or Days of Future Past or the Wolverine movies (excluding Origins of course).",
            "First class is quite good. Days of Future past is my favorite X-Men movie. Apocalypse had some cool scenes (especially the Quicksilver one) but they dropped the ball on the titular vilain and his costume design was fuckin\u2019 awful. He looked like Ivan Ooze from the Power Rangers movies. \n\nI don\u2019t even wanna talk about Dark Phoenix.\n\nEdit: Apocalypse should be at least Thanos Size and built in live action.",
            "the focus on Mystique reeks of studio pseudo-science with focus groups and graphs that say having star power is more important than a good movie; Jennifer Lawrence was massively popular, so this was an attempt to jump on that train.\n\n  \nLike these movies have fantastic casts, but are so terribly written.",
            "Apocalypse isn\u2019t the best but it\u2019s way better than Dark Phoenix imo.",
            "I honestly think Dark Phoenix is \"better\" than Apocalypse (not counting the Quicksilver scene)",
            "AND FROM THE ASHES OF THEIR WORLD... WE'LL BUILD A BETTER ONE!",
            "Big UP on the Wolverine comment. That legit pissed me off from the beginning. That tease of mystique as Stryker is meaningless and amounted to fuck all happening. \n\nI guess it does circle back to Beast\u2019s comment about time and how it ripples, but that was a big implication that Wolverine would not be going through Weapon X.",
            "That would have made a much more interesting conflict because we already know these characters, and it would be harder for Charles and Scott to go against them since they're all people they care about, instead of only having Charles (once again) torn about Erik's choices.",
            "Does he have any lines of dialogue at all?",
            "That was explained to be psychic energy from Jean's mutation, not the Phoenix Force. Jean in the comics was also doing that before becoming Phoenix (shown in Classic X-Men #42).",
            "100% agreed. I only like specific scenes (Archangel's transformation, Wolverine cameo, Quicksilver moments and Magneto's revenge) but outside of them it's the most tasteless and lazily made film of them all",
            "Magneto was commanded to drill to China or something. You don't remember all the brown CGI smearing across the screen for 5 minutes?",
            "[deleted]",
            "Lead-up to Deadpool & Wolverine basically.",
            "We often use the Rewatches to allow the community to engage in related film discussions prior to a film release (almost like a \"catch up\"). In this case, it's Deadpool & Wolverine, so the ones we are focusing on right now are the X-Men and Deadpool Fox films now that they've established they're part of a greater Multiverse within the MCU.   \n  \nPerhaps we should add a list of the upcoming films we have scheduled whenever we do these Rewatches? I can list the reasoning for the films we've selected in the future, as well.",
            ">\u00a0If you watch the Fox X-Men movies in chronological order beginning with First Class, the emphasis on Mystique makes sense\n\n\nRespectfully disagree. It makes *more* sense but it never really comes together. The post-First Class movies treat her like she's bordering on the level of Xavier/Magneto in terms of being a mutant leader/icon/symbol and challenges their authority, but the movies don't come close to justifying that in the narrative. Outside of maybe the 15 minute assassination sequence in DOFP, where she does almost seem unstoppable in a way that other mutants could be in awe of.\u00a0\n\n\nThematically she's basically a stand in for comic Cyclops right? Xavier's oldest \"student,\" they have an adopted family relationship, Mystique even briefly leads the team in battle in DP, they both eventually become disillusioned with Xavier, grow out of Xavier's shadow, become mutant icons, and find a place between Xavier and Magneto's ideologies to inspire others...\n\n\nBut the thing they're missing is, Cyclops earned that in the comics after decades of earning other X-Men's respect as their team leader in battle and in Xavier's absence their leader overall. He literally was doing Xavier's job, better than Xavier, since Second Genesis. So when he levels up in importance in the 00's it's a natural progression of how things had already been going.\u00a0\n\n\nThat's what makes that story work. Not necessarily the \"decades\" part, but the integral step of seeing this character functionally be the leader everyone relies on, with a skillset (leadership) that truly can rival Xavier and Magneto.\u00a0\n\n\nIn this franchise Mystique isn't shown to be powerful enough to physically rival Xavier/Magneto, or enough of a team leader to make sense that everyone raises her on a pedestal. She spends most of her screentime being a loner and squabbling with people. So her continued (growing over time) prominence does come off as very forced, imo.",
            ">but the acquisition by Disney forced them to push it out.\n\nThat wasn't exactly the reason why the sequel was canned from what I've read. According to Josh Boone (director of New Mutants), the new studio head didn't want to make more prequel films after Apocalypse's reception.",
            "Idk how fake the rumor is but I think The Rock would actually make a good apocalypse. Still needs some effects but even so.\n\nI mean it\u2019s not like we\u2019re gonna get Daniel Day Lewis to play him so I think that\u2019s actually promising.\u00a0",
            "I\u2019d love to see Apocalypse played by Shaq",
            ">Apocalypse should be at least Thanos Size and built in live action.\n\nHe never anywhere near as bad as Thanos in the comics though. He was at best Marvel's version of Vandal Savage.",
            "the challenge is a lot more tougher since they are going up against a previous xmen team, this would force the rookies to come up strategies on how to beat their predecessors since they have clearly for experience than them.",
            "Agree. Personally, I didn't care for the direction they went with her character, and there was no consistent character building with her from movie to movie. It's almost like the writers just chose her to be bad or good based on how it best shoe horned into the movie. But because they did make her essentially 3rd in the character pecking order in the reboot films behind Professor X and Magneto, the role she has in Dark Phoenix isn't surprising.",
            "> Mystique\n\n\"Mutant and proud\" then goes back into human form for the majority of the prequel movies..",
            "Why? Cuz he\u2019s big? The Rock is not a solid enough actor (read;bad) to be a villain that significant with potential to appear in multiple films.",
            "They should've gotten Christopher Judge (Teal'c on Stargate SG1) to play Apocalypse",
            "Being big is part of it. It\u2019d be nice if we could have scenes and shots that don\u2019t rely on effects.  Close up shots where we can actually see a real physically intimidating version of the character. \n\nAnd if you want that, there aren\u2019t many guys with arguably legit acting experience out there. \n\nI suppose I\u2019m also not counting on Apocalypse having as much range as someone like Magneto. I\u2019m hoping he\u2019s written well but being physically imposing has always been one of his defining elements. He\u2019s pretty \u201cstone faced\u201d often. He\u2019s a force of nature in a sense. \n\nMaybe there is a stronger vision for Apocalypse out there. I mean I\u2019d choose Javier Bardem, personally. \nThen again, can Javier play Magneto instead?",
            "I think Benny Safdie's \"Smashing Mashing\" will be a good litmus test for Dwayne's dramatic acting potential.",
            "I personally think by the time they get around to live action apocalypse again, the technology should be good enough to do a cgi or mostly cgi character and can make it a voice role.",
            "They should get someone who can actually act. There are plenty of big guys who can act. And again you dont have to be big anyway to be shown big. I never once thought of Apocalypse as stone faced as he has some pretty machiavellian moments."

            "I'm curious to see how they end up balancing things out here. I could see them shooting stuff with Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart - for this and what comes after - right now or in the near future, due to both of them being up there in terms of age.\n\nI guess this also indicates that they have a handle on the screenplay for whatever the movie ends up being.",

Can\u2019t see hype building around Falcon, Carol, She-Hulk and anyone other than Strange and Spidey.\n\nOntop of that, I wonder how close in filming dates this will be to the inevitable Spider-Man 4 and Doctor Strange 3, since they are both heavily rumored to release before Secret Wars. Same for Shang-Chi 2.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of filming Benedict, Tom, and Simu are going to be doing.",

            "Tbh I thought that Dr.Strange and Thor wouldn't have been in Avengers 5 because off world. I imagined Dr.Strange3 and Thor5 released between Avengers5 and 6, but maybe it's not the case. \n\nThey originally said that Kang Dynasty was more grounded so I imagined a smaller team such as Cap, BP, Carol, Hulk and Shang-Chi, but maybe they want a bigger team now. \n\nRemember that this movie changed the writer, from Loveness to Waldron (who will write SW), so this movie could be more Multiversal than before.",

            "I think they're afraid of doing a small scale Avengers film again after Endgame's box office, which is such a shame. Avengers 1 and 2 have aspects that you just don't get in something like Infinity War and Endgame. Now its looking like they want to reserve Avengers movies for big cross over events where mostly everyone is there. I don't think we'll be getting a smaller, more focused Avengers film again. At least not during this saga.",
            "_Avengers: Secret Invasion_, then _Captain Marvel and the Marvels_ is how they should've done that.\n\nIntro her as the team leader alongside Sam Wilson.

            "Star Lord? Pratt is one of the biggest draws Marvel still has and Vol.3 said he would return.",
            "Am I the only one that thinks this could be an awesome idea if executed correctly? The world needs the Avengers, none of the existing heroes know what to do, and the pressure to not only save the world but also to collaborate with conflicting personalities and live up to the legacy of the first incarnation is super cool in my opinion.",
            "I'm not sold on Doctor Strange 3 coming out before Secret Wars, tbh. We haven't heard any reputable reports about it in a long time, and given how chaotic Marvel's production schedule is right now with other projects, I don't see them secretly developing an entire Doctor Strange sequel before 2026. The Strange-Clea-Incursion stuff will just lead into the opening for Avengers 5, and Strange will have his own subplot dealing with that.",
            "At this point, I see this movie being the _Avengers: Age of Ultron_ of this Saga and they do a two-part take on _Secret Wars_ that's kinda/sorta related to this but it's more of its own thing than a direct sequel. They **need** to establish an Avengers team and they should've done it sooner, but they can kinda make up for lost time if this one is a winner.",
            "The 5 leads will probably end up as: Wolverine. Spider-Man. Deadpool. Dr Strange. Wanda.\n\nWith Thor, Captain America, Captain Marvel, Hulk, Ant-Man, Shuri, Clea, and Shang Chi rounding up the roster but not as prominently featured. Their screentime would be equivalent to Bucky or Drax in Infinity War: bigger than a cameo but not a main character.\n\nWasp dies offscreen or onscreen with a fully helmeted Wasp. I wouldn't bet on the Disney Plus characters (Moon Knight, She-Hulk, Ms Marvel, Hawkeye 2) to have major roles.",
            "They just need an interesting enough story. Like world war hulk with some multiverse stuff thrown in",
            "There was that report about 5 being a take on Avengers Forever.  That could be the one off movie that brings back Chris Evans, Scarlett Johanson and RDJ.",
            "Daredevil would be a smart one to throw on the team too people love him",
            "Still can\u2019t believe they didn\u2019t do a smaller low stakes Avengers movie between this and Endgame, it\u2019s genuinely insane that we have no Avengers team heading into a massive event film",
            "Hype around them *alone* wouldn\u2019t be there, true. Now, hype around them fighting the X-Men\u2026\ud83d\udc40",
            "I think Falcon/Captain America could definitely build up hype. He is a beloved character. Captain Marvel probably not, though. Her last movie proved that both casual audiences and die-hard Marvel fans are pretty much done with her. I think if they center it on Spidey, Strange, Cap, Hawkeye, and Hulk, they have a good shot at getting people really excited",
            "Very true",
            "How the mcu is doing right now? You mean on the back of xmen 97 and Deadpool/wolverine about to break records? \n\nThis sub hates marvel more than anyone I\u2019ve ever known it\u2019s so wild",
            "Lol if the avengers line up was Falcon, She Hulk, Carol and Strange I have 0 interest.\u00a0",
            "I actually think most of the MCU actors enjoy playing their characters. While I think some performers have express some trepidation about being in the MCU at times, I do believe a lot of actors like their characters and enjoy getting a big fat check alongside it.\n\nIt just that most actors want to do stuff besides the MCU, which is why it's important for Marvel to give these actors breaks and let them do other projects.",
            "Yah after infinity war I felt his character had great potential then they f it up by sidelining him in his own movie. wish they went with Scott\u2019s version of doctor strange 2 with the villain nightmare and strange dealing with the death of his sister.",
            "I doubt that they retire any character permanently. The entire point of the multiverse is that anyone can do anything with this franchise going forward.",
            "Benedict already said this before: he'll do avengers before going back to DS3 so definitely option 2. There's no way he'll be saying this stuff if he's just there in post credit scene.",
            "It's definitely option 2",
            "Or the Clea tease won\u2019t pay off until after Avengers 5",
            "I feel like Wolverine or Deadpool would fit better as leads in Secret Wars instead of Avengers 5. And if the Young Avengers movie ever happens, I'm sure Ms. Marvel would be one of the main leads of that alongside Kate Bishop.\n\nHere's the most likely roster of the New Avengers:\n- Spider-Man\n- Dr. Strange\n- Captain America\n- Black Panther\n- Shang-Chi\n- Captain Marvel\n\nHere are some possible bonus members:\n- Ant-Man & Wasp\n- Thor\n- War Machine\n- Vision?\n- Hulk and/or She-Hulk?\n- Star Lord?\n- Yelena Black Widow?\n\n\nOn another note, I really hope we get to see the establishment of the Avengers Mansion in Avengers 5 as well as some connection to the Thunderbolts and the Young Avengers.",
            "Scoopers know jackshit about Dr Strange, let's be real. None of them knew anything when back in 2023 he said he'll be in a new marvel movie, they also didn't even try to include him in avengers movie roster.",
            "Scoopers know nothing now, its best to ignore them",
            "For one thing, we\u2019ve known about this movie for about two years now. We know it\u2019s slated for 2026. We all figured Doctor Strange would be in this. Not necessarily exciting news\n\nFor another, Marvel has done a piss-poor job getting people excited for this movie. Can\u2019t be mad at people not\u2026 being excited",
            "This might be after that",
            "Probably happening at some point. My guess is that they use it to directly set up _Avengers: Secret Wars_ with the _Time Runs Out_ plot (kinda making it the _Captain America: Civil War_ of this story) instead of _Avengers 5_ doing that like it was originally going to. They'll give themselves a little more time, and maybe two movies for _Secret Wars_, to compensate.",
            "Why does that obviously have to come before Avengers 5?",
            "They have everything to do with Jonathan Hickman's _Secret Wars_, and the _Avengers_ comics that he wrote leading up to them.",
            "I feel like Wong fits more of a Nick Fury role so far than Dr. Strange. And speaking of Fury, I hope we get to see him again in either Avengers 5 or the Young Avengers.",
            "About the multiverse.\n\nAs I said earlier: _Avengers 5_ will be a realistic, down-to-earth movie that's completely off the wall and swarming with magic robots.",
            "Emmy-Nominated Actor Don Cheadle?",
            "No we don't. Not every character needs to be an Avenger.",
            "I would make him thee Main character.  \nBeing seriously, he is too popular to be not  used right now, but being as a temporal allly is good enough. We could see more potential interactions with spiderman.",
            "Probably November 2026 cause the article that said that Shawn Levy was in early talks said Marvel pushed the film back.",
            "They prolly thought of it as one project initially (like i choose to believe there are brilliant minds in Marvel that thought of this) but decided to split it into 2 separate things to fulfill the D+ mandate. You can picture them concluding it as a good idea to do CM2 as The Marvels instead cz then they can have Kamala go from her D+ show and straight into the movies to pair up with Carol in it, vice versa with Monica from Wandavision.\n\nBoth can still appear if CM2 was Secret Invasion too.",
            "The series already showed us why Secret Invasion would never work within the MCU. A Secret Invasion Avengers movie as the next thing after Endgame would've been a disaster.",
            "I see the vision but let\u2019s say go with Marvel being adamant about not doing an avengers movie until Avengers 5 - they could totally have a Civil War situation where its a lowkey avengers movie with Captain Marvel : Secret Invasion in Phase 4 featuring a prelim New Avengers team to assist in the big fight and then do it again with Captain America : Brave New World in Phase 5. That\u2019d be seeing the New Avengers team twice before Avengers 5. \n\nAs a Carol Danvers fan I am completely fine with The Marvels never happening. If they do CM3 and it features the expo dump in the Marvels as a plotline they can totally feature other characters in the story. I get needing to pair up Kamala with her the soonest they could but Carol needs to be on earth beyond Endgame first for Kamala\u2019s massive fandom to be believeable in the first place, having Kamala be part of the prelim new avengers team in  CM2:SI and CA4:BNW helps with that.",
            "In all seriousness, I really hope Feige doesn\u2019t commit elder abuse on them.\n\nI haven\u2019t been getting good vibes from Feige in a long time personally.",
            "Yeah but the first act of IW was really well executed. There was 5 months in between the two movies and the story picked up at the same place than the post credit of Ragnarok. I think that not showing the Dimension and just have Clea and Strange pop out of nowhere nearly 5 years (in real time) after MoM post credit would not have the same impact. A Dr Strange 3 movie with their adventures just before A5 would be awesome.",
            "This sounds awesome. Give him a Thor-like journey and have him return in Act 3 changed and ready to turn the tide.",
            "Or third cz Secret Invasion totally should\u2019ve been Carol\u2019s second movie which then sees her leaving Earth at the end to deal with Dar Benn and the collapse of the Kree because of her past actions.",
            "I mean I welcome it totally. Charlize Theron with the Avengers? Im not complaining",
            "They do like to do that.  I hope not. That would be worse than the Captain Marvel treatment in EG. She literally has appeared on screen for 5 seconds and delivered a line of dialogue, it would be ridiculous to have her appear in any major way in A5",
            "It\u2019s usually more a Captain Marvel situation ngl",
            "Pratt is the least interesting person in Guardians 2 or 3, and his movies that don't have a loved Marvel *team*, dinosaurs, or Mario to lean on underperform, just look at shit like Passengers or Garfield that were really relying on his star power alone. He isn't the draw.",
            "I personally think that we're gonna get two _Secret Wars_ movies at this point, with _Doctor Strange 3_ bridging those and _Avengers 5_. I feel like that makes more sense than doing it all in one movie when they've changed what _Avengers 5_ even is so much from what they initially had planned.",

I don\u2019t think so.\n\nI\u2019d imagine they\u2019d be involved like Black Panther in Infinity War or Ant-Man in Endgame where they\u2019re not in the movie from the start but show up and take up a prominent supporting role later, especially considering they are likely coming from another Universe and are not established in the 616 as the Fantastic Four yet.\n\nAs for Cap and Ironman, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be in it, but what versions of them and them leading from the start again, I\u2019m not so sure about; 616 Tony Stark is dead, 616 Captain America is old and retired or also dead(we don\u2019t know), whatever version of these characters we get will be a variant, he will not have the same relationship with the rest of the characters we know, or possibly even the same experiences.\n\nPersonally I hope they do something different with them, nothing crazy but give us versions of IronMan and Captain America that are distinguishable from the 616\u2019s.\n\nTobey Spider-Man I have no issue with and think would be cool but I don\u2019t know what that means for Holland\u2019s Spider-Man who is very much still around and considered an Avenger, having both of them on screen all the time in a non-Spider movie seems a bit much.\n\nAlso for what it\u2019s worth I\u2019m pretty sure Secret Wars is reportedly being split into 2 movies and likely be a two parter like Infinity War/Endgame kind of are, so we will have 3 Avengers movies in the Multiverse Saga.\n\nAs for Secret Wars I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s been said that it would adapt elements of both Hickmans and Shooters Secret Wars but like the rest of the MCU it will be its own thing.",

You have a lost and alone Peter Parker struggling with his identity, it\u2019s like the most perfect silver platter thing ever to introduce miles with this version of Peter, you can\u2019t ask for better circumstances",
            "That makes perfect sense, I agree 100%.",
            "Cope.\n\nThe SSU is more successful than the entire MCU.\n\nMorbius was SO successful that he was released TWICE in theaters !\n\n![gif](giphy|QREPIcqvIxCZ76VHxY)",
            "I agree with all these points except I do think Secret Invasion is pretty much on par with the SSU in terms of writing/editing etc",
            "I agree but Secret Invasion came way too close for my liking. That series is the X-Men Origins: Wolverine of the MCU for me. (Which is still better than Morbius and Madame Web.)",
            "![gif](giphy|y6Inkaz7omxAk)",
            "Definitely",
            "Only thing that elevated it from being on par was the performances, imo."
