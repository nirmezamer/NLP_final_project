We love your sub and would like to rev up another giveaway with the permission of the mod team.\n\n\nThe prize is: one 16TB IronWolf Pro Hard Disk Drive\n\n**How to enter:**\n\n**Just reply to this post once with a top-level comment response on the following topic:**\n\n**What kind of loyalty program matters to you for a company? Is drive capacity, price point, excellent customer service, etc. the highest priority for you?

New accounts created after this post went live are not eligible. Entries are open until June 27, 2024 at 23:59 UTC. We will use a random raffler utility to filter out top level comments (that is, top-level replies to this post, and not to another comment, and not on any cross-posts). The tool will remove duplicate usernames, sort the list, and grab the randomly chosen username, at which point the winner will be contacted within a day or so of the giveaway ending. Winners will have 48 hrs to get us their physical address and contact details for shipping (no PO boxes). Any person who does not reply in time loses their spot and everyone moves up a tier. For example: the 1st place person does not respond, so the 2nd place person gets contacted. Seagate will use the information strictly for shipping purposes only and will ship the drive directly. We reserve the right to edit this post including this process and these rules without notice.

            "A lot of posts are saying that price is king, but that's how we get lousy service and things like the WD SMR fiasco.  Price per TB is definitely a factor, but even more important, to me, is transparency about specs, features, and performance.  The more technically detailed the datasheet the better.  That and good customer service are FAR more likely to bring me back more than saving $10.  I'm a big believer (from experience) in the \"buy cheap, buy twice\" motto and avoid \"budget\" brands for the \"quality/service\" brands.  RunWithIronWolf Seagate",
            "The first thing I look is price point, however that's just the first filter, excellent quality and customer support are very important and I'd argue that I define a base of quality and support first then decide looking at the price after. **RunWithIronWolf and Seagate**",

            "**What kind of loyalty program matters to you for a company?**\n\nNone.  The idea is, Seagate makes hard drives that don't suck, and I buy hard drives that don't suck for my servers.  Loyalty doesn't factor into it.  Making and selling products (in this case, hard drives) that work well and last does.\n\nStorage capacity per drive and price point aren't actually a loyalty program, they're two of a number of factors that go into deciding what to buy and who to buy it from.  For whatever it might be worth I look for a stable price point per drive of a certain capacity when I spec out hardware and stock up on replacements because it makes budgeting easier.\n\nI guess the \"RunWithIronWolf\" thing is supposed to make for a good hashtag, which Reddit doesn't use.  But, okay, there you go.",

            "Just because drive failures over time follow a bathtub curve, it doesn\u2019t mean that customer service should take the same approach. We\u2019ve all experienced companies working hard to get new customers, ignoring them once they\u2019ve made a purchase, and then bending over backwards to get them back when they finally get fed up enough to leave. The most blatant example being an ISP/TV/Phone provider that offers a sweetheart deal, immediately raises the rate as soon as the deal ends, then drops the price back down after you go through the hassle of cancelling.\n\nDon\u2019t do that. You don\u2019t have to flatten the curve, but it should at least be more of a vanity sink than a bathtub. Do more for your established customers and give them a reason to stay. For example, it\u2019s frustrating when a company\u2019s communication slows down or disappears once you\u2019ve purchased their product. Loyalty programs can be great, as long as they\u2019re transparent. Most seem to be just another way to obtain customer data. Solid warranties and tech-support are also important.\n\nPrice point is most important to me. It doesn\u2019t have to be the cheapest, but I consider all the factors when choosing the best value.  I will also add the phrases \u201cRunWithIronWolf\u201d and \u201cSeagate,\u201d because you asked so politely. You\u2019re welcome.",

Loyalty rewards that include price reductions or exclusive deals on products can make a significant difference.\n\n- **Excellent Service:** Outstanding customer service enhances the overall experience. A program that provides dedicated support lines, faster response times, or extended warranties is highly appealing.\n\nIn summary, a loyalty program that balances drive capacity, competitive pricing, and excellent service is the most appealing. For example, Seagate's program, possibly branded as RunWithIronWolf, would be particularly attractive if it provided these benefits.",

There was one band I _loved_ from the 00's, a tiny metal band called Erg Noor where it was just a Ukranian guy that released a half dozen albums on a webpage, no advertising or anything, just some bedroom recorded music for fun, and as far as I can tell those albums are completely lost to time outside a few songs on youtube. And once those songs are gone from youtube, the music will be gone forever.\n\nMakes me so damn sad.",

            "One thing to learn from Reddit and Discord is that people are more likely to engage if they can be anonymous. I am much more likely to be authentic with people when I know it won't show up during a job interview. I'm much less active and engaged on Facebook or LinkedIn and assume any info I get there is sanitized to the point of ambiguity.",
            "I have a love/hate relationship with reddit.\n\nI love that it has so many active subs, but I really despise the management of it.",
            "Another thing that not even nearly enough people talk about is \"Fandom\", formerly Wikia.\n\nInstead of hosting their own instance of MediaWiki or similar, far too many people make their \"own\" wiki about their interest on fandom.com. And a huge chunk of pre-established big fan wikis of the past (previously running on MediaWiki or some similar engine) migrated there, too.\n\nThe obvious problem, just like with Reddit or Discord, is that it's centralized, and that Fandom outright owns the website and all of your Wikias.\n\nIt gets to dictate what the page layout will be like, and Fandom's pages are *ATROCIOUS* nowadays. There's a metric ton of unrelated banners for whatever brain goo hype-content-of-the-day, autoplaying videos about those unrelated topics and more shit like that. The page layout/design is a horrible ADHD mess. And you can't even browse image galleries normally anymore because someone at Fandom decided that the website should behave like an app. Every direct link to an image page is forcefully redirected to the main article page, so instead of clicking previews to open in a new tab, you're forced to view images in a pop-up thing on the original page. Also, a while ago they forcibly converted all pre-existing JPGs into WEBPs, which is *maybe* not necessarily a \"worse\" format on its own, but lossy->lossy conversion, especially of stuff that was already rare and probably in low resolution, is a crime.\n\nIt gets to dictate the content, too. The GTA wiki had an issue with transcripts of missions and dialogues from San Andreas because (naturally) they had the dreaded \"N-word\" which is somehow 100x worse than \"fuck\". Today Fandom doesn't like this, tomorrow it doesn't like anything that mentions celebrities / well-known people in any form, and your wikia about some movie series is suddenly gone.\n\nIf you and the hoster of your website start to disagree about some things, you can always pack up all your files and migrate to a different hoster. But you can't pack up a Fandom-hosted wikia, or a Reddit-hosted subreddit, with all of their accumulated content.",

            "I cannot stress enough that one of the most significant factors that play into the death of internet forums in substitution for one or two platforms like Reddit and Discord is that 90%, maybe even 95% of Gen Z simply won't engage in something if it doesn't have a mobile app. As someone who didn't have a smartphone until I was 16, I HATE it when my peers or those younger to me go about as if WEBSITES dont exist anymore, a looot of people don't even use their computers to browse the web anymore. If they can't have access to a service via their phones that are with them 24/7, they are not going to care about it. It's why, for example, Musicboard is more often suggested than Rateyourmusic by and for zoomers who are into music, despite the former having both a smaller database and userbase, and the latter being arguably the definitive archive of the world's music and discussion about songs, albums and artists. Musicboard has an app where you can search up your music, rate or review it, and leave comments on them for others to reply to. RYM does not have an app, but has literally everything Musicboard offers with 50x more contributions, ratings, reviews and comments in their database. It all gets overlooked by the fact that you need to log into a website on your computer to properly use it.",

It replicates the function of a message board, but it is able to cover such a vast array of topics that it overcame one of the main hurdles of message boards.  You used to have a separate message board for each fandom or interest you had.  Now it's just all in one.  There are tradeoffs to that, but people voted with their feet, and some of us held out longer than others.  It was years between Digg falling apart, and me finally migrating here.  \n  \nWhen I used to google questions about tech support, I would find myself browsing random forums.  Now, top google results all point to relevant Reddit threads.  \n\nAs for Discord, I don't really get it.  IRC, but with pictures and videos as options?  Is that it?  That's all it took to get kids to jump into chatrooms?  I don't get the appeal.  It's just a giant, never-ending wall of text.

Long, boring story goes here (involving a large cast of emotionally damaged geeks) that ends with me at long last putting my mental health needs above my dedication to my favorite anime and leaving for good.\n\nWhile I do not regret my choice, it does, regrettably, put me completely out of the loop where it regards the almost inevitable eventual tragedy of those who stayed behind finally deciding to pull the plug. The forum traces back to 2004, with some manually backed-up threads from an older forum that go back even further, so regardless of how you feel about Evangelion or me and my former coworkers, it's an invaluable archive.

            "I think discord addresses an entirely different problem. Since the beginning we've had messaging services like IRC to AIM to Google Messenger (the web one), and most traffic has always went through closed networks. While they used open protocols for a whole, they weren't replacements for forums, but a different method of communication where everything is instant and most were large rooms with smaller conversations spinning off into smaller groups or chats. \n\nForums on the other hand are much slower and open for others to join in at any point in the conversation over a longer period of time. Conversations stay up for long stretches of time and can get revived with new information or interest. It's a fundamentally different paradigm to instant messaging which is much more ephemeral but quick to respond (assuming the person with the answer to your question is on). \n\nReddit definitely replaced forums for the sole reason that finding a subreddit for your interest is significantly easier than finding a random internet forum based around your interest that is active. That has been the long struggle for forums and the reason so many of them banded  together to create community networks to cross pollinate posts. Not to mention more the more niche forums remained in obscurity since users were never exposed to that niche in the first place. Reddit made that all easier and you easily hop from one broad topic to smaller topics to more and more niche subreddits. Similar case can be made for Discord in finding different communities to join and providing comparable voice and video chat to boot.\n\nI grew up on forums and spinning up a few of my own back in the day so I have that nostalgia for them, but I think Reddit really took that model and perfected it. Obviously the site has it's issues, but it's the evolution of the format and the only thing we can do is look out for the next evolution of the format and hope it's an open framework.",

We had to close shop because the dwindling user count and the rising costs. we did end launching GTA Encyclopaedia before closing for good tho, the precursor of the modern GTA wiki.\n\nThe other point of contention is the \"private\" part of Discord. forums were no better, most if not all locked content behind registration which also hampered indexing. or even having content tiers locked behind paywalls.",

And as copyright trolls have shown in the last 20+ years, sometimes all it takes is the *threat* of a lawsuit.\n\nThere's one former employer of mine that is a fortune 500 company in the telecomm industry and a well-known household name in the US. I worked there for over a decade. Some groups weren't bad and I guess I didn't hate the company itself.. but I absolutely hated the upper management, the way they disregarded their tech employees, the way one of the executive directors micromanaged the shit out of department / over-committed us without getting any buy-in from his people on time-lines or strategies while allowing other departments to jump the queue and bypass normal process / only hired people of his same nationality to positions of management (he was Indian and while I have worked with plenty of Indians and other ethnicity and have no beef with anybody as a group, this guy as an individual was an asshole and always struck me as a bit racist - you know it's bad when even other *Indian* co-workers point it out lol). \n\n*Point being that despite all this, I won't mention the company name (at least not directly and not publicly) - even with an anonymous account - bc I don't want to ever find myself in a position where I could potentially have to payback even a portion of my severance if I ever got doxxed etc.*\n\nAnd that's aside from less official stuff.. if your next potential employer can find your name online bad-mouthing a former employer, it's not wrong of them to assume that you could do the same to them (leaving aside the ethics of them spying on your online life or if the former employer actually *deserved* the bad-mouthing they got).",

I know a lot of guys that switched over to it bc they had issues with Steam's built-in voice chat back in the day. Not saying their text chat is bad per se but most people I know that use discord are either users who initially flocked to it due to the superior voice chat quality or people that use it because of the network effort that it's developed since then. I don't know anybody who loves its UI entirely.",

I mean in old school forums with old school mods, if someone said something you didn't like but it was within the rules and the mods were decent, your choices were pretty much to respond (begin flame wars) or ignore it and move on... Plus reddit has kinda pushed out large swathes of people by banning certain communities and topic so there is a *definite* political lean here that was a lot more balanced on old school forums\n\n> But the bigger problem I have with reddit is the downvote system - things that are completely innocuous can be downvoted to oblivion, which can lead to those who would otherwise try to write thoughtful replies being punished and end up just doing low-effort comments.\n\nAbsolutely agree with you here. The voting system is garbage. IMHO the old school forum way of things (assuming you had decent and fair mods) much more often led to *actual discussion* compared to on reddit it often leads to people who do what I call \"drive-by downvoting\". If someone says 4 or 5 things in a comment, they might not even understand which thing it is they are being downvoted for. Plus the voting system is kinda random on things..

            "Be warned with tapes - if the drive goes bad, you're in for some expensive repairs. They're enough of a niche market that repair companies usually charge 4 figures as a minimum.\n\nThere's only really two players in the field - IBM and Tandberg. I have drives from both, but mostly IBM (10 IBM, 2 Tandberg). I have 3 of their LTO-6s - one standalone and two for my TL2000 autoloader. One of the latter is faulty. The other two are fully functional. Because of how finicky tape drives can be, and the fact that you need basically the same generation drive to read its tapes, I make sure I always have two drives capable of reading any given tape.\n\nThe magnets don't wear out (they're electromagnets). What tend to wear out are the other mechanical parts - the internals of a tape drive are roughly watch-making (many, many tiny parts all moving in sequence). I've found there's a weakness in the IBM 3580 leader pin grabber (the arm that pulls the leader pin out of the tape cartridge) - two of my drives have this piece broken. I'm looking to 3D-print some replacements. There are other failure modes though - I have an LTO-4 that loads a tape but then gives a generic failure message that it doesn't recognise the tape, and an LTO-3 that won't load tapes, period. I'm keeping those for spares. I also have an LTO-7 that displays an infuriating SCSI error that I can't seem to find any information on - the drive starts writing fine, but then crashes.\n\nI have a Tandberg LTO-3 and an LTO-5. The latter just flat out doesn't work (diagnostics return failure). The former works fine. However, I haven't used the former drive for long enough to know how it'll behave.\n\nSo I have:\n\n10x IBM 3580s - 5 are functional, 5 are faulty.\n\n2x Tandbergs - 1 is functional, 1 is faulty.\n\nGiving me a nice 50% problem rate with both manufacturers! Even so, I prefer the IBM drives as their diagnostic tool, ITDT, is very comprehensive and runs on any platform.\n\nNote that tape drives will use a SAS interface so you will need a SAS HBA. And you will also need disks fast enough to drive them - often you want a RAID behind them because the tape will stop moving if the data isn't flowing, and that increases wear on it, so you need something able to throw data at the tape continuously without stopping to seek.\n\nTake this as fair warning that tapes are a difficult field to get into! My setup is starting to come together with Bacula as my backup software - it'll push data to tape as fast as the mechanism will allow (160MB/s for LTO-6). I have lots of different generations of tape I've collected over the years, about 200TB total. The different sizes actually make for convenient backups because I can choose to write entire tapes at once, which they're best at.",
