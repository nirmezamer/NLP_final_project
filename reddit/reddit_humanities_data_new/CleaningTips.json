            "Dear OP,\n\nLots of people on this post are trying to help. Under the first comments some people commenting about neglect. It\u2019s worth reading what they wrote if you missed it. \n\nNow for the practicalities. Unfortunately this level of mould is not healthy. This goes beyond \u201cwhat a wet winter we\u2019ve had\u201d. It can be dangerous to clean, but if you really, really want to do a little: get a mask (remember from covid? Boots still sells some), bags to throw things out, disposable gloves, kitchen roll [paper towel], and the Dettol Mould and Mildew spray (I think it\u2019s in a green bottle) works well. You should be able to get all of that at Tesco or a regular size supermarket. Move anything you can away from the walls. Open all the windows. Spray the area. Wear clothes that won\u2019t be ruined if a drop gets on them and don\u2019t touch your eyes. It will smell strong of chemicals. Leave the room and shut the door. In 30min go back in, wipe the walls and throw out the kitchen roll as you do. Keep the windows open. Leave the room for as long as you can so it can air out. This is not your fault. Not ever. \n\nBEFORE you start. Take more photos. Email them to a gmail account or something in case you lose your phone/your phone is taken. \n\nAlso: make an appointment at your GP. Tell them \u201cI have been struggling with breathing. It has been getting worse over the last ___ months. Could it be because of the black mould in my home?\u201d Then they should start a conversation and report this up the chain. Try to not feel embarrassed. They have seen it all. If you\u2019re in an area with long GP waits, if you get a crusty receptionist who is trying to not give you an appointment say \u201cI think I have a lung infection\u201d that should get you seen and they can\u2019t listen to your chest over the phone. \n\nYou mentioned siblings. On Monday try to go with sibling to their school. Find a teacher. The more senior the better. Say \u201cI\u2019m concerned about Sibling\u2019s health because we have so much black mould at home.\u201d Then a student at the school having something said about them should trigger the school reporting/doing something. \n\nFinally, Google your local council and try to find \u201cenvironmental health\u201d and ask them for advice on \u201cchildren and black mould\u201d. They should do their jobs. \n\n\u201cFailure to safeguard\u201d and \u201cchild\u201d are really good buzzwords to have ready. \n\nYour parents probably love you. Like you, they might not know where to start. I\u2019m so sorry this situation has gotten this out of hand. Please keep us posted if you can. Good luck. Please tell your GP, teachers, etc.",
            "Hi mate I work for a damp and mould specialist. Mould is usually caused by condensation, so you need to improve ventilation in your room. To do this try to leave your window open for several hours a day, leave a gap between furniture and the wall and if you have a passive vent or trickle vents on your windows make sure they're open.\n\nNext thing I would suggest would be to buy a dehumidifier, electric ones are great but can be a little noisy, but chemical degmhumidiefier will do the job and will be much cheaper. Something like a unibond 360 will do the trick \n\nFinally to clean the mould use strong bleach or mould killer. Ideally wear a mask. Fill a bucket with clean warm water, get a clean sponge. Spray the mould killer directly onto the mould liberally, like really cover it, don't be shy at all, you need to kill all the spores. Wipe it off with the clean dry sponge then rinse the sponge in the water, ring it out and repeat. You don't want to be wiping that dirty water all over your walls because if the spores aren't dead you'll spread them around.",
            "Your parents should be the ones to clean it. But since they won\u2019t and you\u2019re looking for a quick fix, go to a discount store (in the US we have walmart, not sure what the equivalent is there). \n\nIn the cleaning sprays section, there should be something for mold and mildew, usually near the bathroom sprays. Get that, a couple of those cheap yellow sponges with the rough green side, a roll or two of paper towels, and a face mask (if you have one left over from covid, that\u2019s one less thing to buy!). \n\nIf you have some money left over, get a small can of kilz paint (or whatever the UK equivalent is) and a brush! Kilz has paint that is made to seal in mold, stains, odors, etc. There\u2019s also other brands that should do this, look up paint specifically for mold. If you can\u2019t get it now, try to save up for it, this is important!\n\nOpen your door and windows since you\u2019re using a strong chemical spray. Put the face mask on. Rip the rest of that wallpaper that\u2019s covering the mold off so you can get as close to the source as possible. Spray the mold spray on the spots, let it sit for a few minutes, then scrub it with the rough side of the sponge. Repeat until the mold is gone. Then spray it a final time and wipe clean with the paper towels. \n\nIf you bought the paint, wait until the wall is dry and paint a few layers of it over the mold spots. It might not look pretty, but it should help prevent the mold from coming back. \n\nHaving your parents handle it or a professional would obviously be ideal, but that should be an easy solution for now at least. There\u2019s probably also youtube videos about getting rid of mold, youtube is great for learning things!\n\nEdit: I forgot to add, for the bugs, you can get some glue traps or fly tape, they\u2019re pretty cheap!",

If there is still a leak /water getting into the wall then you can\u2019t permanently fix it with bleach.

            "Hi friend, \n\nLet\u2019s have a serious talk real quick. There are two main kinds of abuse:\n- the first is mental/physical/sexual abuse\n- the second is neglect \n\nWhat is happening to you is neglect. Your parents are failing to provide you a safe and clean environment. They are failing to do anything to fix this situation and move you to a safe space in the home. \n\nThere is water getting into your walls and has now resulted in mold filling your room and most likely your house. This is a dangerous health situation. I want to give you an idea of how serious this is. If you were renting, your landlord would be required to find you a safe apartment immediately! I just went through this with our old apartment and had mushrooms growing out of windows in our \u201cluxury\u201d apartment. \n\nDo you have a family member or friend that is safe to stay with? \n\nSigned, \nYour Reddit Older Sister",
            "What does that say about the healthfulness of the conditions. There\u2019s a lot of information online about treating black mold.\nApparently no one is going to save you, so you are all you have, right now.\u00a0",
            "Oh it's gonna cost hundreds if not thousands. You really shouldn't be expected to deal with this if you're a minor and living with your parents.",
            "OP, it sounds like you're in the UK.\u00a0\n\n\nDo your parents own the house, or do they rent? If they're tenants (renters) the law is very clear about the responsibility landlords have to maintain properties, including dealing with mould.\u00a0\n\n\nIf your parents own the house, it's up to them if they decide to have the mould treated or not.\u00a0\n\n\nIf your parents are hoarders and the mould is a consequence of hoarding/ not cleaning/ not maintaining the property, you could talk to someone at school or college about it, and they can look into getting some help for your family.\u00a0\n\n\nThis would most likely be family support or children's services- it's called different things in different areas, and is what used to be called 'social services'. Some people find this really frightening because they think it means the children will be taken away and put into care.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat is most likely to happen if your family is referred for family support is that a worker will come to the house, ask some questions about how everyone is doing, how your parents are managing, and then they'll talk about practical ways to get your house sorted out. They might help with other things like making sure your parents are getting the right benefits, any issues with school or college, making sure everyone is getting any health issues sorted etc.\n\n\nI'd really encourage you to talk to someone who is in a position to get your family some proper help.",
            "Are you in the UK? Call social services / the council and ask for a wellbeing visit. You cant live like this, its not cleanable by an average person, and if this is your room I worry about how habitable your house is.\n\nYou can raise it anonymously so you have plausable deniability with your parents, but at the end of the day this would be considered child abuse / endangerment and need resolving at a deeper level, not just cleaning",

They are the ones who should look at this situation and see that they are at fault, and see that this is not okay by ANY means. This situation, which they have not fixed, is 100% their fault. And is 100% neglect. It is your right as a human on this earth to deserve a safe and comfortable living space in your own home (which they should be providing now, but that statement stands indefinitely).\n\nIt hurts me to read your comment that you \"should've cleaned more early on.\" I see you trying to accept blame here which is not yours to take on \ud83d\udc94. \n\nAs someone who is working through my childhood neglect now at 31 years old; I understand very well how much this hurts.

No, it\u2019s not your fault. \n\nPeople here are alarmed because from the outside this looks like a very unhealthy living situation, and your parents allowing you to live in a situation like this seems to indicate abuse/neglect or possibly mental health/addiction issues.

You may be able to use oven cleaner on that surface too, but I'm not sure so don't take my word for it.
