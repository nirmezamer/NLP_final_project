        "content": "My friend and I are on vacation in Turkey. Everything was going great. Then yesterday we had an horse riding excursion on the beach. We'd had a couple of drinks beforehand and was joking around. My friend suddenly started acting strange and started snapping at everything I said. I carried on joking with her thinking nothing of it and then she suddenly shouted at me, got up and walked off. I did the excursion on my own. When I finished, I got back to the place and looked for her but she was nowhere to be found. She then started sending me messages saying I'd annoyed her and then continued to do the horse riding without following her and we got in a massive argument via text. When I went up to the room, we both had a big row and said some really nasty things to each other and she packed her case and left. Her mum has contacted me to say she is staying in a different hotel and is in a really low mood. I've tried reaching out to her but she's blocked me in everything and I can't contact her. We have four days left before we go home. Has something like this happened to anyone else and did it get resolved?",

            "Yeah, it's happened to me once, just over ten years ago. A friend and I were travelling and he was doing things that were pissing me off and I was doing things that were pissing him off. After trying to talk about it, I realised that we saw things so differently that talking about it wasn't helping, in fact it was making things worse. I decided that getting some space between us would be a good idea so I moved to different accommodation thinking it would only be for a few days. I was surprised by what happened over the next few days but I felt so much better not being in my friend's presence. I met some amazing people, forgot about all the shit that was going on with my friend and just enjoyed my time in a foreign country. \n\nA few days passed and I was having lunch in a cafe by myself looking out onto the street watching the world go by. My friend walked past and as we noticed each other he stopped. I asked how he was and he said he was okay. He asked me the same and I told him that I was also okay. It was a very brief encounter and he carried on his way. It was at that moment that I realised I was having more fun doing things without him than I was with him. I continued to travel on my own and I guess he did the same. We've never seen or spoken to each other since.",
            "Reach out to her mother and confirm she is ok; tell the mom she has blocked you and you just want to confirm for safety. If you feel ok with it, tell the mom you are open to your friend reaching out if she needs help or wants to talk before going home.\n\nThen do your thing. \n\nThe way you described what happened your friend may have had some anxiety/low mood that started or flared with the travel. Or, something you may have said joking/innocently hit very wrong but you did not realize (possible based on school+joking+suddenly snappish). Can\u2019t know more unless you share what she shouted at you before walking away. \n\nYou know your friend better to know if they would have wanted you to come after them immediately to hash it out. Only you and she know what microfrustrations/pet peeves got aired out when back at the hotel.\n\nHowever, all you can do now is confirm she is safe and accept that this might need to be worked out back home. \n\nSome people just don\u2019t travel well together. I have friends that are very good ones, but I would never travel with. I have friends I am not as consistently close with/as long as friends with who travel great.\n\nFinal though - if this is a friend who has previously emotionally manipulated you (hot/cold suddenly, pouts off if not getting their way, etc) in the past\u2026might be best to let this be the end.",

            "Yes! It's actually quite normal to fall out as you're both out of your comfort zone and travelling is stressful. She does seem to have overreacted big time but that may be because her expectations of travelling were very different.... Just give yourself some time alone to calm down and then try to have a chat without putting blame on anyone. My friend and I ended up having the best night out after falling out.",
            "Enjoy having the hotel room to yourself, book on a tour, maybe chat to some other tourists round the pool/at the bar. If she's blocked you, then there's not much you can do until she stops sulking, so at least try to enjoy what's left of your trip.",

            "So... we were diving as a trio, my wife, our friend and me. I'm the most experienced diver with about 250+ dives, divemaster, rescue diver, etc. They both had *maybe* 10 dives each. We're diving in Bonaire where they don't really regulate anything. There's no guides, you just pick up your tanks, drive yourself to a site, then enter the water. So I'm in charge.\n\nAnyway, we spend about an hour diving, see some cool shit and suddenly he signals \"Low on air, I'm going deeper\" and decides to head out on his own. This is... incredible. Like jaw droppingly the stupidest thing I've ever seen. He swims off without looking back, he's not narced we're too shallow for that, he's just fucking stupid. My wife has plenty of air and signals \"Should I go after him,\" and I write on my slate ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOT because I'm low on air and then we'd have two divers who are operating independently without any means of coordination.\n\nWife and I surface and I'm thinking 'shit, who do we contact, can we ask other divers around for help,' and about five minutes later he surfaces and says \"Hey, that was great.\" We're not done with the holiday, we've got three or four days together and he's primarily my wife's friend. I'm trying to think of all the ways I can communicate just how bad this was without using every fucking curseword in the book, but I lose it on him.\n\nAfter being upset with the words I've chosen to elucidate the absolute stupidity of his actions he apologizes, buys us drinks, and we're all good.\n\nNever diving with that dude again, holy shit.",
            "Yes, I did a week away with a friend, we had a huge argument on the first day just after arriving in destination. I had insisted on separate rooms as I had travelled with her before and knew I needed some space as she loved to control every minute. She sent me a long text pointing out all of my shortcomings and how she expected me to act. I blocked her , switched my room to the other side of the resort, changed my seat location for the flight home and enjoyed my week away. It's been more than 3 years and we have not spoken another word to each other.",
            "It sounds like there are other things going on above and beyond the specific argument you guys had. I'm guessing there is more to the story than acting strange and then having a blow up fight over text. So start with considering what might have gone on that caused you to fall out.\n\nAsk her mom to let her know that you'd like to work things out and sorry for any offense you called. Don't talk over text, and definitely don't talk when you've been drinking.\n\nIf you're good friends you'll work it out",

            "One of my friends was sulking all day because we didn't visit a place at a certain time, which I must say he also failed to bring up at any point during the trip, this happened a couple of other times during the same trip and it really brought the vibes down. But it ended well we've gone on more trips since then also, I don't get the need to find something to be mad about when you're on vacation but I guess not everyone can control their emotions well while dealing with the added stress of planning etc..",
            "I had something similar like that happen while on a 3 month overseas trip with my best friend at the time... but it never got resolved.\n\nIn my case we had agreed the following day to go on a 2 hour trip to a special surf location in NZ and we had arranged to get picked up by someone at 7am. Except he got up before me, but didn't nudge me awake or say anything and left without me. When he got back later that day, we had a massive argument at the guesthouse (the only serious argument we'd ever had in 10 years of f/ship). We went our separate ways after that. I continued the rest of the trip on my own, going to the Hawaiian islands. It actually turned out to be a good thing, because at the time I was very shy and it brought me out of my shell and I learned to meet people and do things on my own.\n\nEffectively it was the end of the friendship. I did visit see them again about 10 years later but though I didn't hold a grudge, it wasn't the same. The magic of the friendship had gone.",
            "I've seen/heard of/experienced stuff like this a few times while travelling. \n\nThey say if you can travel with your partner, you're meant for each other (maybe). \nTravelling is a bit of a stress test and puts people out of their comfort zones, it's like being under the influence of an outside force, much like people might argue when they're drinking its best to sober up and then try to sort it out when heads are cooler.\n\nGive it a bit of time, prepare yourself yo be your most empathetic, and then try to have an honest conversation.\n\nI've done this with my friends and we are still friends to this day!",

I kept the friendships because they were parts of important periods (concert-going days) or had an important role (fellow solo woman I could go on hikes, to the movies or travel with).\nI broke off contact. With one shortly after with the second about 4 years later, after she sent me a really abusive email.\n\nI now go to concerts alone or with other people or meet people there... And I found other solo/childfree/childless friends that are living powerful forces in my life! \n\nAnd still: I now always travel with a separate room and with the agreement that we do stuff together we both want to do and do things separately in between, if we don't feel like tagging along! \n\nMy annual spa vacation where I also visit friends I do on my own, 50% of the time.\n\nI cannot recommend this  kind of setup enough!\n\n@OP: tell your friend's mother you're blocked, ask if your friend is OK and that you're ok talking, or also doing the vacation separately and then meet up again on the flight.",

Travel can be stressful, people have different expectations, usually more alcohol involved, being with someone 24/7 alone can lead to arguments.\n\nI know you\u2019re blocked but I\u2019d try to reach out to her and start to make up at least.  Have her mom send a message from you saying you would like to talk.  Or you can leave a message at the front desk if you know her new hotel.  \n\nAt the very least I hope you can both talk it out by the time you\u2019re heading home.

It\u2019s perfectly okay to go and do you own things when you feel stress is building. But the essential aspect is to communicate effectively with one another. And just say, \u2018hey, you know what? I need some space\u2019. And that should be okay. Texting is never effective communication. If the friendship is good enough it will survive.\u00a0",

I'm guessing something she wanted to communicate to you but couldn't so frustration and anxiety took over and made a mess of thing.\n\nI recommend you give her and yourself some space to think this over.

            "Yes, on a week trip to Dubai, basically 2 close friends ditched for an hour and we are not friends anymore.\n\nwe were in a mall shopping we initially started out together but they didn't like staying in a shop I liked while I was trying on clothes so we split up. We met up again to leave, but I found out I left something in the shop and went back to look for it, which took 5 minutes. \n\nThey resumed shopping. I texted them to let them know that I'm done and asked if we were leaving or staying longer they said they're coming so we can go (we had plans afterwards that were time sensitive)\n\nso I waited for them in cafe next to the parking .. waited for 45 minutes all the while texting them that if they need more time it's OK just let me know so I can go do something instead of sitting waiting next to the parking and they keep texting back that they're almost done and will come.\n\nEventually i text them to let them know that they kept me waiting an hour and they cant be serious. \n\none of them comes to get me and tells me that I'm lying and haven't been waiting for an hour and shows me my texts and the time. I'm like, no look at the first text I sent. It's been an hour. Why would I lie about that?\n\nI was extremely offended, especially when the other friend was saying it's not a big deal instead of apologizing.\n\nI let it go without arguing, but they can tell I'm pissed off and the atmosphere is tense in the car. We forgo our initial plan since we were late and just head to dinner instead. At dinner everything is somewhat back to normal but there is distance.\n\nThe days after they start acting weird (taking too much time getting ready - refuse to split food bills - walk away when I'm looking at something with them) but not doing anything confrontational as I am the one who planned the trip and have all the itinerary.\n\nwhen we got back home we stayed in contact until I texted them the photos I have of them from the trip and we settled any payments.\n\nSince then they have basically ignored my existence and hangout together without me, they occasionally text me for holidays greeting and if there's something going on with a mutual friend.\n\nI don't mind at all as the feeling is mutual.",

OP didn't fall for her crap so she doubled down and changed accommodation,  yet OP is not running after her so she gets her mum involved. \n\nYou know what? She's so immature, she should stay home not travel abroad. \n\n@ OP: go on and enjoy the rest of your vacation,  it will be awkward as fuck on the plane home but that's the last you have to put up with her. You don't have to cuddle her mood swings.",

I've made this mistake before, and it's unfortunate but not unfixable with a conversation. \n\nthis being said, blocking her like that was probably too much- going somewhere else for a night or two, and then meeting her in a few days for a meal could have probably sorted things out.",

I'm ashamed to confess that. \n\nShe was badly hurt and didn't speak to me again. That I was extremely insecure having moved to a new place, started a new course and not fitting in very well, and completely inexperienced at those things, may explain why I did it. But what about how I was able to do it! Being someone who would direct that at someone that was kind, simply tells you what kind of person I was (and am, because while we can change, people also retain much of the same capabilities).\n\nFeel sorry for people like me and know that not accepting that kind of treatment is the BEST thing for you to do for yourself, and is also about the only thing that can help them change. It is a brick wall boundary that will cause them to reflect (assuming they are capable) and realize the way they acted didn't work, it couldn't be undone, it wasn't just accepted, they have lost that friendship, no one is going to accept blame, it's their problem if they want to address having it on their conscience. I had to accept a lot about myself through that and other experiences. In every case because people set boundaries that were non-negotiable. Not good enough, not going through that again, bye bye.",
            "I would do this.  Don't let one person ruin your trip",
            "She's 30 and I'm 35. Known her for 5 years. She's had many friends come and go over the years as they all end up doing a runner sooner rather than later. I'm her longest friend and the only one who sticks around because she can be fun to be with. We've never really argued before, but I do know when she has argued with other people she always gets her mum involved - whether that is for her mum to have a go at them on her behalf or to try and resolve things (which hardly ever happens). That was one of the comments I made in the heat of the moment last night when I said, \"There's a reason all your friends run from you and it's not them, it's you, because you're a psycho and I see it now myself. Get some help instead of spitting out your dummy and running to tell your mum everything\". \n\nAll this just because she was nervous about the horse riding and I was reassuring her she would be ok and made a light-hearted joke of saying unless I slapped the horse on the ass and watched it take off with her on its back like she was a jockey in the grand national.",
            "She was nervous of the horse riding. I'd kept saying leading up to it did she want to do it and she said yeah and she was up for anything but nervous. When we got there I was reassuring her she would be ok but started joking saying I might slap the horse on the ass and watch it bolt while she was on its back and that would get rid of her nerves quickly. She started snapping at me afterwards telling me to shut up and she didn't find me funny, she actually found me to be a nasty person for saying that to her. I told her to lighten up and that I was joking and continued saying things like by the end of this, we'll be able to do the grand national and she stood up, said she wasn't doing it, that I had annoyed het with my jokes and she was done with me for the day and stormed off. That made me a bit angry but I got over it quickly as I did the horse riding solo. Next time she messaged me she was asking why I hadn't gone after her and I'd left her alone in a foreign country where anything could have happened while I went horse riding and that I had basically ruined the day. Things just escalated from there and I said some really horrible things in retaliation. I know my words can sometimes be very hurtful as I don't hold back when I'm angry so I fuelled things even more by telling her to grow up and that nobody wants to be around her because she's a mardy cow.",
            "Haha me and my buddy travelling got into a bit of a tiff, we were pissed off for about 2 days and spent some alone time during those 2 days but same accommodation, we reconciled before moving onto the next stop of the trip and all was good",
            "> OP claims that they were joking around- chances are they said something, without malicious intentions, which offended the other person. \n\nWe only have OP's side and it could totally be unintended offense. And like you said, the kind that can be fixed with honest conversation. \n\n But there's folks (\"it's just a joke\" and \"she's just being sensitive\")  - who are relentless in their needling or their jokes crossed a line.  We don't know the kind of joking and the subject.  Sometimes when traveling with a person, that person reveals their \"true self\" and that their true self is a horrible person.      \n\nAnyway, I'm assuming OP is being honest and it was good natured joking.  I just wanted to comment on the possibility that the joking was toxic.",
            "I knew what she was like and never would have travelled with her again but her mom had just passed and she \"needed it\". I though the separate rooms would save us but didn't even make through the first evening. It was hilarious boarding the flight, she was her assigned window seat with her whole body turned to the side ready to give me the biggest  cold shoulder she could. Of course I had switched my seat and spent the flight happily chatting with someone I had met on the resort while shot me dirty looks from across the plane. \n\nWe got to our connection city and I was kinda keeping an eye on her to make sure she was going in the right direction, I have travelled a LOT , her not quite as much but I still felt a bit responsible until I saw there people she was chatting with shoot me dirty looks too. That's when I decided she was on her own.\n\nFunnily enough our flight home got diverted to another province. I am pretty savvy dealing with delays and rebooking so me and the people I was sitting close to on the plane hit one of the kiosks and I got us rebooked on the next flight while she was still in the lineup with lots of other people. I did get on the first flight out, my ex friend did not. I gave her a big smile as I was boarding. The next flight was about 6 hours later, not sure if she got on that or a later one.",
            "I thought she just had a strong personality which I am ok with as I have one myself. What clinched it for me was her selfishness , I want, I need, you have to. Nope, I am not your date, you didn't pay for me, I was crystal clear about the trip you just chose to ignore what I said and start making demands. She isn't insecure, she is used to bullying people into doing exactly what she wants.",

She had a right to be mad, but she also overreacted to some degree. You two need to talk, but you need to be less patronizing about her fear."

        "content": "I went through a TSA check yesterday before a flight, and my MacBook Air was missing when I went to retrieve it from a bin. There was a different unaccounted for laptop, so it may have been that someone mistakenly took it. I immediately told TSA and filed a police report. After exhausting my other options, I remembered to check Find My, but my flight was leaving, and I didn\u2019t have time to search the area where it was showing up in the airport. Police did very little even when I told them the area where it was in the airport, though I suspect that\u2019s for good legal reasons.\n\nAnyway, the laptop now is in the Philippines. It is now somewhere near Carmen in the Davao del Norte Province. Is there anything I can do to get TSA, DOT, or police to review footage to determine who took the laptop? Is there anything I can do to try to get my laptop back other than relying on the person with it to text my number? (I\u2019ve placed the laptop on lost mode.)\n\nThank you.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve appreciated reading a bunch of your responses. Even when writing this post, I don\u2019t think that I expected to be able to find a way to retrieve my laptop, but at least thinking about possible solutions and reading what everyone has said has helped me process a lot of the anger I was feeling and find peace.

We had intended to visit the Sugar Dunes and also went off-roading with a guide on the sand at Wahiba Sands, where we camped. In both cases, a 4WD was unquestionably required. Regarding Jebel Shams, I did see 2WD cars there, so you don't need a 4WD to access the camping areas in and around the balcony walk.",

It wasn't difficult at all, although to be fair it would have been trickier in the wet and I do have a little bit of practice driving on those types of rough roads. Just take it easy on the slopes and big bumps and know how to use the low gears and engine braking on an auto transmission and you'll be fine.\n\nAlso, you can visit the Wahiba Sands even if you don't have a 4WD. Mamy desert campsites will offer to pick you up on the outskirts of Al Wasil or Bidiyah for free or a small fee.",
