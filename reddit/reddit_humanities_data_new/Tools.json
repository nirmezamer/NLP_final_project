It's a bigger set that comes with a precision bit driver and bit extension, but that same mini ratchet. It's a great little set that bails me out of some tough spots.",

There are so many tools I've passed over because they don't come with Robbies. Yes, I know I could just swap some in, but half the point of buying Wiha or PB Swiss drivers is the excellence of their bits.",

I understand it's supposed to be a smaller ratchet but it is still too short to provide any decent leverage. The locking bit holder is pretty sweet though I just wish the magnetic strength was a bit more to actually be able to pick up screws with the tip of the bit in the locking bit holder.  I'm much prefer the icon bit set  at harbor freight",

Ended up taking it apart and lost the tiny pin for the selector. \n\nWasn't really usable out the box though. On most screws it wouldn't ratchet past 1/4 turn or so after breaking loose.",

            "Not today, Satan.",
            "Oh crap, they're right there! How did I miss that? Thank you Jeebus. That's actually a really nice set of bits, then. I'd prefer a couple smaller sizes of Torx rather than so many hex sizes, and maybe one more slotted, but that's nitpicking. Nice set.",
            "Ah, but unless I'm mistaken your profile suggests you are Dutch. Here in North America, square drives are very common especially in electrical and carpentry. \n\nI like them about as well as Torx\u2014Torx works a little better, but there are too many sizes and it's sometimes hard to know which one is right just by looking. You can also end up using a size that's slightly too small if you're not careful, in which case it works, kinda, but will often strip.\n\nRobertson comes in three obviously-different sizes, and in practice it's almost always the medium #2 size that is used. A #1 will not drive a #2, it'll just spin. Very simple, and drives nearly as well as Torx does.",

            "That's a good comparison. The ones I have I tend to like but I don't have that many. As much as I enjoy getting new tools most of the Icon line would be a duplicate for tools I already have assuming I actually need them. They make quite a few things I'll never need. I noticed a 1 inch drive torque wrench for sale there a few days ago that had to be at least 5 ft long, I'll never need that...lol",
            "I picked it up because I have to maintain a lot of weird conveyors with awkwardly placed stops, and automated screwdrivers/screw feeders.\n\nKnipex, Wiha, and Wera have been taking over my toolbox since I took this job",
            "Funny because there was a post recently in the Harbor Freight sub where some folks were complaining about the security bits included in the meme tool kit because some are mangling them.",
            "Those aren't Robertson though, they're just regular Square without the taper and they suck. If you use them long enough a taper will eventually wear in making them more usable.",
            "Electrical Robertson strip every time. I hate those things. Went with the combo #1 and #2s (ecx) so much more reliable. \n\nRobertson is fine for hard screws like decking and anything hardened but honestly torx is superior in every way to almost any faster type imo.",
            "I have a slightly larger wiha set I use.  Love the versatility.  It came in a fold out pouch that has a Velcro strip. I stuck it to the inside of my locker door so it's easy to get to. I'm in maintenance in a factory weld shop with many conveyors too and other areas this has made so much easier.",
            "Interesting, I had no idea they weren't synonyms! If Wikipedia is to be believed, most square-drive screws actually are squares, not Robertsons.",
            "Are you sure? [If you look at the bits from the side they have a pretty defined taper](https://assets.rs-online.com/f_auto,q_auto,c_scale,w_400/73641040.jpg). I'm not particularly well versed in square and Robertson bits, but I would've thought Wiha would make their stuff to work with Robertson",
            "People use the terms interchangeably all the time but a real Robertson has a slight taper on the bit and in the screw head. It's what causes the screw to stick to the bit so well. Same as the old \"stick a beer bottle to the wall trick\".\n\nA non-tapered bit will not slide all the way into a Robertson screw and won't make full contact with the walls of the screw head, causing one or the other to round off. Which is usually where most of the hate for Robbies comes from. They're using the wrong bit."
