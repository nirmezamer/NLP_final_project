It's also worth check your front panel connectors to make sure they are connected properly and trying a different outlet.\n\n* If you have any power related issues, like your system not starting, shutting down, sleeping, restarting or waking from sleep, try to test with another power supply, as unstable voltages (such as on the 12V, 5V, 5VSB and 3.3V rails) can cause a variety of issues that can be inconsistent and hard to diagnose.\n\n* Make sure your memory modules (RAM) are installed in the primary DIMM slots, some motherboards will not POST (Power-on self-test) if the RAM is installed in the secondary DIMM slots. The primary slots should be labelled on the motherboard or specified in the motherboard manual.\n\n* If your system does power on, but won't get past the POST screen, please ensure your CPU, RAM and GPU are installed correctly and try clearing the CMOS \u2014 this can normally be done by disconnecting the motherboard from power and removing the CMOS battery for a few minutes. Many motherboards also have clear CMOS reset jumpers or buttons you can use, please consult your motherboard or system manual on how to clear the CMOS.\n\n* If your system still won't POST, check if your motherboard has a Debug LED and consult your motherboard manual to check what step it's stuck on. Make your motherboard is compatible with the CPU you have \u2014 most AM4 and AM5 motherboards should have BIOS flashback, allowing you to update the BIOS without needing the CPU or RAM installed. Consult your motherboard manual as the BIOS flashback procedure will very depending on the make and model. When using BIOS flashback, we recommend using a USB 2.0 drive that is 8GB or less and formatted as FAT32, as some implementations of BIOS flashback don't work reliably with USB 3.0 drives and/or USB drives larger than 8GB.\n\n* If you are using an AMD Radeon RX 6000, AMD Radeon RX 7000 or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 GPU, please ensure you are using separate 6-8pin PCIe cables and not using daisy-chained or splitter cables, as these may not be able to supply sufficient power \u2014 some GPUs may have LED indicators by the connector to let you know if the GPU isn't receiving adequate power, please consult your GPU and PSU manual for more information on how to correctly power your GPU.\n\n* Make sure your Monitor/TV is plugged into the HDMI or DisplayPort output from your graphics card and not the motherboard. If this still doesn't work, try a different Monitor/TV, if you are using any HDMI or DisplayPort adapters, converters or splitters, remove these and use a direct connection, try switching between HDMI and DisplayPort and try different HDMI or DisplayPort cables to rule out any problems here. For best results, always use certified HDMI or DisplayPort cables.\n\n* Make sure you are running the latest software updates for your operating system, games and applications.\n\n* Scan your PC for any viruses or malware using Windows Security (formerly Windows Defender) or other reputable Anti-Virus or Anti-Malware solution, as malware, viruses, adware and other unwanted software can cause crashes, freezes, hangs and other performance, security, stability and compatibility issues.\n\n* Make sure you are running the latest [AMD chipset and/or graphics drivers](https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html), note that some devices, such as laptops, desktops and handhelds, may have custom hardware IDs or other manufacturer changes, in which case, you may have to download drivers from the manufacturer of your device.\n\n* If you need to reinstall GPU drivers, we recommend using the [AMD Cleanup Utility](https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/faqs/GPU-601.html) or [Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU)](https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-) to perform a clean installation of the GPU drivers, a guide on how to use DDU can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRRx_3r8GgCpBAMuhT9n5kK6Zse_DYKWvjsW0rLcYQ0/edit)\n\n* If you have installed GPU drivers after using the AMD Cleanup Utility or DDU, you may experience stutter in some games while the shaders are cached again.\n\n* If Windows Update is replacing your GPU drivers (example of what that looks like [here](https://imgur.com/a/DLLMZ3L)) please [view the following](https://drive.proton.me/urls/QHH65SVJ9M#Q25EPyELVdrT) on the steps you can take.\n\n* If you are on Windows 10 or Windows 11 and experience flickering, stuttering or brightness issues during gaming or video playback with hardware acceleration enabled, try disabling Multiplane Overlay (MPO), as some users have reported this has resolved their issues \u2014 more information on disabling MPO is available in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/yvyqc7/disabling_multiplane_overlay_mpo_fixed_all/)\n\n* If a game is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please verify and repair the game files through Steam, Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect, EA App, GOG Galaxy, Xbox App, Battle.net or whichever game client you are using.\n\n* If a program is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please reinstall the program or attempt to repair the installation using the program installer/uninstaller.\n\n* If you are on Windows and are experiencing stuttering or lower than expected performance, make sure you are using the Balanced or High Performance power plan and restore them to their default values, this can be checked under Control Panel > System and Security > Power Options.\n\n* Make sure you are using the latest BIOS, Firmware and Drivers for your motherboard, laptop, desktop and any other components and peripherals you have connected to your system. These updates often contain bug fixes, new features and improve compatibility and interoperability.\n\n* If you have any overclocks, underclocks, overvolts, undervolts, custom power curves or similar: **revert everything to stock clocks, timings, voltages and settings**, this includes disabling XMP/EXPO/DOCP \u2014 to do this, go into your BIOS and restore the factory settings \u2014 this is typically labelled 'Restore Default', 'Restore Optimized Defaults', 'Load Optimized Defaults' or some similar variation. If you are using other utilities like MSI Afterburner or Ryzen Master, you may also have to restore default settings in those utilities as well.\n\n* If you experience crashes, freezes, unexpected shutdown or just want to check if your system is stable, you can stability test your system with the utilities linked below. Please remember that just because your system turns on, doesn't make it stable and that overclocking is not guaranteed and can vary depending on the setup you have and the silicon lottery of your CPU/GPU/RAM, you should always thoroughly stability test your system \u2014 many reading this post will have unstable systems and won't even know it.\n\n---\n\n[OCCT](https://www.ocbase.com/) \u2014 Ocbase is the home of OCCT, the most popular all-in-one stability / stress testing / benchmarking / monitoring tool available for PC.\n\n[Prime95](https://www.mersenne.org/download/) \u2014 Prime95 has been a popular choice for stress / torture testing a CPU since its introduction, especially with overclockers and system builders. Since the software makes heavy use of the processor's integer and floating point instructions, it feeds the processor a consistent and verifiable workload to test the stability of the CPU and the L1/L2/L3 processor cache. Additionally, it uses all of the cores of a multi-CPU / multi-core system to ensure a high-load stress test environment.\n\n[AIDA64 Extreme](https://www.aida64.com/downloads/latesta64xe) \u2014 AIDA64 Extreme is an industry-leading system information tool, loved by PC enthusiasts around the world, which not only provides extremely detailed information about both hardware and installed software, but also helps users diagnose issues and offers benchmarks to measure the performance of the computer.\n\n[Furmark 2](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/) \u2014 FurMark 2 is the successor of the venerable FurMark 1 and is a very intensive GPU stress test on Windows (32-bit and 64-bit) and Linux (32-bit and 64-bit) platforms. It's also a quick OpenGL and Vulkan graphics benchmark with online scores.\n\n[MSI Kombustor](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/kombustor/) \u2014 MSI Kombustor is MSI's exclusive burn-in benchmarking tool based on the well-known FurMark software. This program is specifically designed to push your graphics card to the limits to test stability and thermal performance. Kombustor supports cutting edge 3D APIs such as OpenGL or Vulkan.\n\n[MemTest86](https://www.memtest86.com/) \u2014 MemTest86 boots from a USB flash drive and tests the RAM in your computer for faults using a series of comprehensive algorithms and test patterns. Bad RAM is one of the most frustrating computer problems to have as symptoms are often random and hard to pin down. MemTest86 can help diagnose faulty RAM (or rule it out as a cause of system instability). As such it is often used by system builders, PC repair stores, overclockers & PC manufacturers.\n\n[MemTest86+](https://memtest.org/) \u2014 Memtest86+ is a stand-alone memory tester for x86 and x86-64 architecture computers. It provides a more thorough memory check than that provided by BIOS memory tests. Memtest86+ can be loaded and run either directly by a PC BIOS (legacy or UEFI) or via an intermediate bootloader that supports the Linux 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, or EFI handover boot protocol. It should work on any Pentium class or later 32-bit or 64-bit x86 CPU.\n\n[SeaTools](https://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/) \u2014 SeaTools - Quick diagnostic tool that checks the health of your drive.\n\nFor more advanced SSD and HDD diagnostic utilities, please check the website of your SSD or HDD manufacturer, as they usually offer specialised software to test the drive and update firmware, some examples include Samsung Magician, Western Digital Dashboard and the Crucial Storage Executive.\n\nSome motherboards, laptops and desktops may also have built-in BIOS diagnostic utilities to stress test certain components or the entire system. Please consult your motherboard or system manual for more information.\n\nA truly stable system should be able to run any of these utilities or built-in diagnostics without any crashes, freezes, errors or other issues. These utilities can help you narrow down which component(s) in your system are faulty, aren't installed correctly or have unstable overclocks, underclocks, overvolts, undervolts, custom power curves etc...\n\nIf you require help using any of these programs, please read the help sections on each website or use Google and YouTube, as there are a plethora of guides and tutorials available.\n\n---\n\n* If you have a custom built PC, recently upgraded, started overclocking or want to know if your current PSU will support a hardware upgrade, please use one of the below PSU calculator and make sure the PSU you have can supply enough power when your system is under full load \u2014 If your PSU isn't able to supply enough power, you are likely to have issues starting your system and may experience system shutdown when under load.\n\n* PSU Calculators: [FSP](https://www.fsplifestyle.com/landing/calculator.html), [OuterVision](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator), [Cooler Master](https://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/), [Seasonic](https://seasonic.com/wattage-calculator), [Newegg](https://www.newegg.com/tools/power-supply-calculator/), [be quiet!](https://www.bequiet.com/en/psucalculator), [MSI](https://www.msi.com/power-supply-calculator), you can also add all your components into [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) and it will provide an estimate wattage.\n\n* If you are using Windows 10 or Windows 11, use the built-in System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) commands to check for any corrupt or missing operating system files and attempt to repair them, a guide is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y7HOS6UiOBXAWtNFBJ0w70f14izRQcBYD9puuSw6Ghs/edit)\n\n* Try and apply common sense to an issue, for example if you have flickering on your TV or Monitor, try simple things like changing the HDMI or DisplayPort cable and port on the GPU and display you are using. If you've recently installed a mod and that game now crashes, uninstall that mod. If one of your memory modules is no longer being detected, is there any physical damage to the memory module, DIMM slot on the motherboard or pins, have you tried reseating it etc...\n\n---\n\nIf you have tried all of the above and are still facing the same issue, please **backup any important files/data** and completely reinstall your operating system using a USB drive.\n\n**Only use official Windows 10 or Windows 11 ISO images that come direct from Microsoft.**\n\nThe latest Windows 10 and Windows 11 ISO images can be downloaded from the [Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/) using the Media Creation Tool.\n\nIt's not recommended to use utilities or programs which modify Windows or to use 3rd party, custom or slimmed Windows ISO images, as these are non-standard ISO images, they could have viruses, malware and may cause stability and compatibility issues.\n\nIf you have done all the above steps and are still facing an issue, please follow the below template for submitting a request, the more detail you can include the better. **If you post something like 'pc crashes', don't list your PC specifications, what you've tried to resolve the issue or don't provide any helpful information, then don't expect a response, as there's not enough useful information to go on and it will be assumed you haven't read this post or tried any of the steps outlined above.**\n\n*Below is an example template you could use...*\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the issue**: The Invincible will crash with Adrenalin 24.3.1 if you have Radeon Chill enabled and try to open the in-game overlay , this is not an issue if you revert to Adrenalin 24.2.1.\n\n**What I have tried to resolve the issue**: I have reinstalled 24.3.1 with the AMD Cleanup Utility, reset my in-game graphics settings, verified game files in the Epic Games Store and confirmed the issue is still present if Radeon Chill is enabled.\n\n**System specifications:**\n\n* Operating System: Windows 11 23H2, OS Build 22631.3374 (to find OS build version, press the Windows Key + R and type *winver*)\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7700, cooled by a be quiet!

            "Hey everyone, I'm planning to build a PC for 1080p gaming and need some advice. I have two builds in mind:\n\n* Ryzen 5 7600x with RX 7900 GRE\n* Ryzen 7 7800x3D with RX 7700 XT\n\nI know both are a bit overkill for 1080p, but I'm set on it. Which setup would be better for hitting 144fps on high graphics settings in games like R6, cs2, Minecraft, and simulations like Assetto Corsa? I mostly play games like R6, cs2, Minecraft, and simulations, so I think the Ryzen 7 7800x3D with RX 7700 XT combo might be better for me. However, I'm also looking forward to GTA VI on PC and will have a Series S as a backup. I believe I can achieve +144fps in games like cs2, PUBG, or R6 even with the R5 7600x and RX 7900 GRE combo.",

I mean as i understand, Ryzen 9 7950X3D is perhaps the best they offer right now but what is the difference between that and non 3D models? I mean where i live that 3D model costs a bit over 110\u20ac more than 7950X. Is there really some benefit for that bigger 3D cache or is it just some few FPS more in games? Really worth for over 100\u20ac difference? In future more useful?\n\nI don't plan going 4K (playing 1440p) atleast for now, but does that 3D cache bring more benefit on 4K?\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "Adrenaline causing issues with Windows again.\n\nA little over a month ago (end of February), I had issues after updating Adrenalin from 23.12.1 to 24.2.1. Today, it happened again, when I tried updating to 24.3.1.\n\nHere's the problem: after updating driver through Adrenalin app, upon boot it effectively locks up on me. The only 2 things I was able to do the first time around were open file explorer and open the run prompt with WIN + R, though either option was limited in what I could do with them. Today, I wasn't able to do either.\n\nThe fix is to boot into safe mode (use the restart button on the front of the case, then on the lock screen, hold shift while clicking restart) and run DDU to wipe Radeon drivers, then PC returns to normal on the default Windows VGA drivers. But as soon as I reinstall any version of Adrenalin starting with 24 it returns to the broken state. Reinstalling 23.12.1 works though. The only thing that doesn't work is that Forza Horizon throws an error \"Unable to detect graphics driver version\" (code: FH302). Game seems to run fine, it just stops the game from loading until I select \"ignore warning.\"\n\nMy original suspicion was that my boot drive could be failing, so I bought a new one and installed Windows 10 fresh on it, but the exact same thing happens again as soon as I installed newer versions of Adrenalin (24.1.1, 24.2.1, and 24.3.1).\n\nThe weird thing this time around was that I updated drivers a week ago and all seemed fine until I restarted my PC today, then the exact same behavior as last time, so I repeated my troubleshooting steps from last time around, and that fixed it. Again, Forza still throws error FH302.\n\nI bought the card in April of 2023, and in the 10 months between purchase and the first time it happened, I had no other issues with the card.\n\nSpecs:  \nRyzen 7 5700G  \nASRock X470 Gaming K4  \nRadeon RX 6900XT (reference card)  \n32GB (4x8) Trident Z RGB DDR4 3200MHz CL16  \nXPG SX8200 Pro 512GB (original)/Crucial T500 1TB (updated)  \nCorsair RM1000X",

            "6950xt for 370$ ? Hey everyone, im traveling back to my home country from canada and i have the chance to buy a brand new 6950XT reference model for 370$ American all in. Issue is that im gonna use it for 4k and i mostly play dota 2 and single player games with all the eye canady possible.\n\n I know that its a good card for raster performance but its horrible for ray tracing and it doesn't have dlss and i use SVP project for motion interpolation so i can get 60 fps playback on my video content. Its has a new RIFE AI interpolation  model thats optimized for nvidia tensor RT. It still works with other gpu's but not as fast as with nvidia cards.\n\nSo i need peoples help who have this card and use it for 4k and maybe also svp what are ur impressions ? I can also buy a used 3080 TI for arroud the same price but that one has 12 gb of ram thats a bit iffy for 4k gaming plus its used. I dont really wanna spend more than 400$ do u think i should go for it ?  I could save up for a 4070 super but that over my budget especially with taxes and everything and i dont think its that good of a card. \n\nSo should i just suck it up cuz im too cheap and cant afford a 4090 like the peasant that i am or is there something else that u would recommend for that price point ? Honestly i think i just need people to sell me the card so i buy it without remorse but not having the nvidia features really sucks and i cant make myself buy it. should i just go for the used 3080 ti ?",

I have paused Windows Updates to give the PC enough time to run uninterrupted without rebooting.

I did all the basic troubleshooting/diagnostics like installing older drivers, disabling cpu graphics, and reinstalling the adrenaline software. Nothing seemed to work. However, just recently, I disabled the cpu graphics and un-installed adrenaline software. After that, my screen started to flicker, then eventually ended up black with the flashing taskbar. I'm able to pull up tsk manager but trying to type anything is impossible since it keeps trying to load something. (Pin wheel by cursor)\nI've tried resetting the pc and reinstalling windows, but it always ends up failing during the process. Would anyone be able to help? Anything would be appreciated, thank you. I was able to reinstall the software, which took an unbelievably amount of time and effort, LOL. But nothing changed unfortunately.",

Started with troubleshooting the CPU, saw temps in the 70ish. Tried to find the temperature alerts in the BIOS, no dice and doesn't seem to exist. So ended up reseating the CPU, then applied the Honeywell paste then upgraded to the TR Peerless Assassin, then upgrading the fans to Noctuas, then a new case (the Lancool 216), then added multiple 140mm fans. Beeping continues throughout.\n\nWondered then if it was the GPU because the memory junction temperatures were above 90C. Repasted the GPU with Honeywell and the memory with U6Pro. Still... beeping.\n\nTried popping out the CMOS battery for five minutes at a time multiple times to no effect. Tried tuning the fans to be much more aggressive and loud for both the GPU and the CPU and no dice. Noticed that setting a super aggressive fan curve for the GPU seemed to 'delay' the beeping but even after the upgrade to a new case with two 200mm fans and five 140mm fans tuned aggressively it'll still beep even though the temps are all well within spec.\n\nOnly started recently after being able to regularly game on this build in a smaller crappier less heat-efficient case at 1200p playing Cyberpunk 2077 for hours on end with RT on.\n\n**System specifications:**\n\n* Operating System: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro Version10.0.22631 Build 22631\n* CPU: AMD 5800X3D cooled with the Peerless Assassin sporting two NF-A12x25 PWMs and PTM7950 paste.\n* GPU: Stock AMD 7900XT with fans tuned for high performance, repasted with PTM7950 for the chip and Upsiren U6Pro for the memory.\n* Motherboard: ASRock B550M Pro SE\n* RAM: G.Skill Trident Z F4-3600C16D-32GTZNC\n* Storage: Western Digital 1TB SN770 sporting a Thermalright M.2 Pro 2280 heatsink with stock pad.\n* PSU: Rosewill CAPSTONE-1000-M 1000W 80+ Gold\n* Display: Monoprice 27\" Dark Matter 1440p 144hz monitor via USB-C\n* Case: Lancool 216 with four additional be quiet!

I spend most of my time coding, photoshop and gaming. 20%/20%/60% split I'd say.\n\nGames varies. BG3, Total War, Crusader Kings, Escape from Tarkov. I don't particularly see the promise of DLSS or RTX. I've had terrible experiences (in Control, CP2077, Tomb Raider, BG3.) and prefer to play native resolution and adjust settings before DLSS until the AI upscaling is at a level I can tolerate. I currently utilise Process Lasso for certain games to gain that little extra.\n\nI play on my UW, and realistically I strive for 60-80 where available. One can dream of 120fps+ on UW but seemingly not possible on my 3090.\n\nMy priority is to get more stable and higher low fps. I don't want to decrease my workflow too much though, I'm happy to give up, 5-10% speed in that department if I gain it in minimum lower fps and potential higher fps.\n\nI am not opposed to spending money, though I don't want to frivolously spend. I do plan on upgrading in late 2024/2025. AM5, 7800X3D or 7950X3D with a 5090 or more likely the highest VRAM capable AMD alternative if there are no huge upgrade to RTX games or DLSS. Though I am somewhat intrigued with frame gen. Obviously I will have to upgrade almost everything (AM5/RAM architecture)\n\nWill 5800X3D satiate me until next gen GPUs where I will upgrade whole system or is it purely a waste of money. I've seen benchmarks, I've read up it looks noticeable to be honest at the resolution I'm playing on. I just want confirmation outside myself and graphs.\n\nI hear that the OS is less snappy and quick from other written reviews. Is this true?

Had clicked on one of the three HDD's and\u00a0 gone no further when the PC crashed again with a note that no boot device found. Think it crashed as many as four times before it became unbootable.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs I had lots of programs on my C drive (2 tb SD SN850x) I had recently cloned its contents (at the time not enough to fill the 500 gb SSD that I used). However that /SSD has a damaged SATA port pin and isn't recognized. So, now I'm having to start over with a windows 11 iso\u00a0 and want to install W11 temporarily on a HDD in a USB device, \\\\so that I will be able to regain all the programs on the original C drive and any other data.... and eventually\u00a0 format it and start over with it as the boot drive.A pain in the butt and should never have happened.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nI have no idea what happened or why, but I for \\*\\*bleep\\*\\* sure will never install StoreMI again. (I think I had installed it before on one of my 3 Ryzen powered PC's, found it to be of no use and uninstalled it.. but I don't recall when or on which PC-other two are x470/3700x and X570/5800x.)\n\nI've opened a support ticket at AMD and also posted in the AMD community, I think.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAgain, I'm am extremely unhappy!!

My temporary solution is to place a deck of cards in one corner of the GPU to prevent it from sagging, but this is a terrible permanent solution. If i remove the support after post, i get massive ammounts of artifacts. Asrock does not provide a support bracket for this GPU, something that all the other manufacturers do. I have had this card for 3 days, and a I feel like this happened way too soon for my liking. Is there a known easy fix to this, or should I just RMA it right away? The only quick solution in terms of RMA is to \"regret the purchase\", get my money back and pick another model as they are out of stock on Asrock. ASUS is the only 7900 xtx manufaturer which is similarly priced, although i would very much like to not support ASUS any further, given the ammount of crap comming from their direction. The other 7900 xtx cards are 250-400$ more expensive, so those options are out of the question. It is also worth noting that i tried to put pressure on my old GPU while posting and it posted just fine, so this is likely and internal malfuntion in the Asrock GPU.

If it is just gaming, with \"normal\" productivity workloads (ie, anything outside of video editing, blender, AI/ML, etc), there really is no reason to get a 7950x. Unless you absolutely need the extra cores that come with the complexity of a dual-CCD die, it's probably best to stick with a single die 8 core CPU. For gaming, the clear winner is 7800x3D, which can handle \"normal\" productivity workloads just fine and is also basically the fastest gaming chip available today. Another note, that at 1440p most games are GPU bound more than CPU bound, so it actually won't matter a whole lot if you are picking a modern CPU anyway. Plenty of people pair the 5800X3D with the 7900XT with great results.\n\nIf you aren't planning on going 4k, the 7900xtx is plenty overkill.

            "NVIDIA hasn't gated DLSS versioning to specific hardware in the past (in the \"turing cannot run DLSS 3.0\" sense), there is little reason to think they'll do so in the future given they just sold Nintendo on Ampere era hardware that they will need to support anyway.\n\nlike that meme is literally the diametric opposite of reality, NVIDIA differentiates on their software and broader/longer support than AMD or other competitors.  NVIDIA basically hasn't segmented CUDA at all, official support for newer features will need newer hardware (potentially even when a less-ideal version can be implemented without it) but software is the moat, and you don't benefit from putting another moat around the ability for customers to access the thing that gives you a moat.\n\nIn graphics drivers, NVIDIA is still supporting Maxwell and AMD has already deprecated everything pre-RDNA, including products they're literally still selling (5700G is being sold today despite being on security-only legacy status, which they did less than 2 years after launching it).  They did a shit job on supporting Terascale too, that was deprecated ages before the competing NVIDIA architectures.\n\nmeanwhile turing is moving closer and closer to a 50% uplift at native-TAA equivalent visual quality lol, it's already well above 30% uplift, that's some sweet fine wine right there.",
            "Hopefully with reduced artifact generation.",
            ">I have no idea\n\nThat's OK.",
            "Likewise, but on a 7800xt oc'd. I don't understand the 4000 series hype, especially their midranges. I'm waiting on fsr3.1 upscaler. I'm getting pretty much similar RT performance to the 4070, even beating it at higher resolution because I don't run out of vram when FG gets enabled. Every RT game over 100 FPS with fsr3 frame generation Mod. Apart from the forest area in chapter 2  Alan wake I can enable path tracing. I just use 1200p quality mode internal resolution, then enable RSR in adrenaline which outputs it to my 4k display. I can get a very good experience if I choose to. I still prefer RT off.",
            "Lets just say I've been in the room with Sony, and numbers like \"32gb and \"48gb\" were bandied about. (which should be normal/standard in 2028 and beyond given 32gb is the current PC meta and cheap now).\n\nIt won't be less than 24gb. It probably won't be 64gb+\n\n(all numbers being unified memory)",
            "They were joking about DLSS3's frame gen only working on Ada Lovelace and not on Turing and Ampere.",
            "I'm going to level with you:\n\nFirst, AMD doesn't view RT as a gimmick like you. Why are they increasing RT performance gen over gen? Why are they working on FSR 3/3.1 with the express goal of generating frames in those workloads? Your views are misaligned with theirs. \n\nSecond, you *chose* to get an AMD card. AMD is significantly behind Nvidia on this front. Its a con for their current cards. You have no basis to call RT/PT a gimmick because you can't genuinely experience games with those features. \n\nThere's zero reason to spout nonsense simply to justify the lack of said features for the card you purchased. You don't need to be hyperbolic because of this. It's ignorant.",
            "I prefer native resolution with RT, I'm not a fan of all the *ss*. If I can't hit 60+fps I just turn off RT shadows and keep the rest of the RT options on. No path tracing, though.",
            "Interesting. Is there any reason why they've decided to start doing massive jumps in their development after years of not so impressive gains?\n\nHas the tech just matured for massive deployment or are they afraid of the PC market moving to ahead?",
            "7800xt gigabyte oc model, manual overclocked, cyberpunk ultra RT 1440p quality mode +fsr3 fg, 108 FPS avg. psycho RT 104 AVG. Path tracing is the only issue at 1440p, so I have to go to 1200p quality mode around 80 AVG. \nAlan wake 2, the forest area is the only issue with path tracing, just like it is with the Nvidia GPUs like the 4070. Everywhere else zero issues with enabling Path tracing.\nWitcher 3, 1440p maxed settings over 100 FPS AVG. \nI still say with a good enough experience with RT, it is a gimmick and definitely not ready as yet. \nOf course AMD will improve on all things, why would they not?, you make no sense whatsoever. \nMore than 90% of pc gamers use a non 4000 series GPU, so that means the majority of gamers think RT is a gimmick. \nAnd why do Nvidia fanboys only run to Nvidia sponsored titles when trying to flex about Ray tracing?.. cyberpunk is literally altered for Nvidia hardware. \nI think the 7000 series does a fairly good job with RT, considering it's using it's Raw power without dedicated hardware.",
            "Don't bother using facts and logic to argue with AMD fanboys. Like you said yourself, they will say absolutely anything to justify buying a much inferior GPU, despite being only slightly cheaper than Nvidia's.   \n  \nI would totally understand being paid to defend multibillion companies, but doing it for free is just depressing.",
            ">Why are they increasing RT performance gen over gen?\n\nAs with tesselation, The Filthy Green has convinced plebs it is an absolutely must have superamazing technology that will work ONE DAY so they gotta react.\n\nThe funny part is the reaction itself.\n\nAs The Filthy Green, AMD just, cough, sponsors games.\n\nI mean, that \"Control\" game that without RT gimmick locks like it was made in 2005, ain't it cool that it even used A DIFFERENT CODEPATH for different GPUs, cough.\n\n>AMD is significantly behind Nvidia on this front\n\nWhat year is it, FFS... The greenboi are terrible...",
            "Where is the facts and logic?...A new generation is literally about to launch, and more than 90% of pc gamers still don't use a 4000 series GPU. So the facts is that majority of gamers couldn't care less about RT. \nYou are also literally defending a multi trillion company for FREE in your comment. Make it make sense.",
            "> The Filthy Green\n\nYeah I'm just gonna block this nonsense.",
            "Wow this is honestly a really delusional comment. I understand being a fan of something but this is extreme lol",
            "That is a leap of logic. There has to be reason for Nvidia market domination and non rtx performance is not normally in Nvidia\u2019s favor for the price",
            "[removed]",
            "Nvidias market dominance is primarily down to their upscaling technology. Great marketing also plays a part. It's definitely not down to the ray tracing capabilities, because 90% or more of their consumers are using a 3000 series and older GPU. \nOnly 2 games with \"heavy\" RT is in steam top 100 most played games.  Even the games with weak RT like elden ring and The Finals, gamers are turning the RT off, because it makes zero difference to the experience.",
