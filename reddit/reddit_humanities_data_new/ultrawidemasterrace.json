            "A travesty that it is not officially supported.",
            "it should be a crime to play Elden Ring in anything less than 21:9. When you get to the Cerulean Fields it's just \\*chefs kiss\\*.",
            "I started ER yesterday on 5120x1440 and to my surprise it ran in full resolution for like 3 minutes. Then, stuttering and BAM, black bars back again...",
            "did you encounter and issues using flawless ultra wide? I\u2019ve heard people have trouble after the update",
            "Is there a guide in how to play this in ultrawide and offline mode?",
            "Do you play this in offline / are you already banned for this?",
            "Do you still have to deactivate anticheat for ultrawide fixes to work? It is legitimately the one thing holding me back from a purchase.",
            "Just from small clips I\u2019ve seen the environment looks all the same and not very appealing at all.",
            "The amount of passes this game gets for its technical shortcomings is staggering.  I get it\u2019s a stellar game but the PC port left lots to be desired on the tech side of the table.",
            "I had really hoped that with AC6 natively supporting at least 21:9 that by now Elden Ring (which already *renders* the full 21:9 anyways) would have native ultrawide support, but *noooo*.",
            "100%. Walking over the hill was the dlc's siofra river moment! \u00a0I had to stop and just look around.\u00a0",
            "I had the exact same experience, for a minute there I actually thought they removed those stupid black bars lol",
            "They actually render the full scene, and add the black bars on top of it.  Seriously.  You can Google it if you don't believe me.  You're still taking the performance hit (minimal as it is for most of us) for those bits you aren't seeing too.",
            "There was a lighting issue which was fixed by just toggling flawless ultra wide on and off once or twice",
            "Flawless Widescreen works.\n\nBut the mod \"Ultrawide UI Fixes\" needs an update. It adjusts UI elements to properly fill in the screen.",
            "Google elden ring flawless widescreen",
            "This guy's video walks you through it pretty quickly   \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8Y24o1q6ew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8Y24o1q6ew)",
            "Yes, I\u2019d like to know this",
            "There's a mod to toggle EAC off, and then you just play offline.",
            "From small clips I have seen Porsche 911s look all the same not very appealing at all. That\u2019s a typical internet pick opinion.\n\nSeriously you feeling ok under the hud ?",
            "I didn't know this! It's finally time for me to play!!!",
            "Yeah it was definitely the Siofra River moment for me too lol",
            "The worst is that they actually do render the full scene in those resolutions.  Then, put black bars on top of it.",
            "Is the lighting issue you\u2019re talking about related to flickering shadows? Flawless Widescreen is working just fine for me but I\u2019m seeing flickering shadows every now and then.",
            "I saw that there were a lot of bugs and the guides are almost 3 year old",
            "Sorry my opinion offended you",
            "In case you\u2019re confused ER still does not support 21:9 natively",
            "Yeah that's what I noticed, it's a fucking stupid decision and makes no sense",
            "Yeah but not a fast flicker, more like someone turning a light switch on and off every now and then",
            "copy eldenring.exe into the same folder. rename start\\_protected\\_game to something else. rename the copied exe to start\\_protected\\_game. If you did that right you shouldn't get the EAC popup when starting the game. The main menu will tell you something about activity detected and go offline, that's fine. if it doesn't go offline then just go offline manually. Oh, make sure flawless widescreen is started and open before starting elden ring.",
            "It\u2019s a stupid opinion and not based on experience or facts",
            "You should game in 4:3 then eh.\n\nSeeing more of the game is a feature, a bonusl, that's not an opinion. It doesn't change anything it looks the same, just more of it.",
            "Oh I know ER doesn't. I've been playing on an LG 45.",
            "As soon as seamless coop works again i will play through ER again with a friend and with Flawless Widescreen.",
            "What? I\u2019m talking about the game not the aspect ratio.",
            "Haha I had the exact same plan",
            "Same. How long do you think it\u2019ll be?"

And OLED was something I really wanted to try, I can say the HDR and pure blacks vs the VA panel on the G9, the upgrade was indeed worth it. I know the word upgrade is kind of subjective as I indeed did lose screen real estate and the higher refresh rate, the oled feels just as fast if not faster even with the lower 175hz. ",
