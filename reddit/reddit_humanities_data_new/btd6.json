            "Tell us what the 7th milestone rewards were....",
            "i got one pop, can i also get an avatar that says \"participation trofy\" in comic sans ms font",
            "I feel like having this be a reddit-only thing was a significant misplay. Not only did a lot of active players certainly miss out (many will find out later and likely be annoyed). \n\nIts also poor design. If players in game got the announcement there'd be more hype. If there wasn't a nearly 3-day gap towards the finish line where we had no idea what our progress was we'd have pushed harder. Particularly if there was an in-game meter that showed progress...that would have been awesome and so much more fun.\n\nThe event was better than nothing but not by much.",
            "I think the game needs to do a slightly better job in game of advertising the events tbh. Without Reddit I would have had no idea just game it was happening.",
            "19 random powers... can you please add one more to make it 20? Please?",
            "I have no idea if I participated or not, because it was unclear. I did the birthday BAD event already so it said it was completed and it gave me a extra reward the other day but there wasn't any note that there was a special event going on with it?",
            "The fact that I only found out about this event after it had gotten to milestone 3 AND it wasn\u2019t clear how to actually enter and submit scores makes this pretty annoying. I had even gone back to major announcements to see if anything had been made clear and found very little information.",
            "Respect to everyone who grinded the quest out, I got way too bored to do it after a bit",
            "Why was there not an in game notice for this? I didn\u2019t even know it existed until seeing this post and only who participated get rewarded :( I don\u2019t even know if I participated or how to participate",
            "Was there even a popup in game about this? I only found this event because of the discord pings. I had to dig back through the event quests to find it too, and it said \"already completed\", so if I didn't know better I wouldn't have even done it.",
            "Will there ever be an event that has a chance of getting Tiers 5?  \nThe Collection ones have a too low probability, could you increase them a little bit?",
            "i helped and got nothin :(......",
            "When and how are we gonna get the rewards?",
            "I did not see this event in the game. I was actively looking for it, but neither was it in quests and nor was it showing up as an event. Last night, I saw the birthday party props in the game but not the event itself. Was it not available to all players?",
            "A misstep in my eyes. Literally nothing identified the event in any way if you didn't catch it on social media. Did you gain anything from this? This is your 6 years. Make it a recognizable milestone in game.   \n  \nAn in game notification telling people to visit reddit, facebook, whatever for all the details could have driven people to your social media presence if that's what this was about. As is, I 'do' follow the subreddit and nearly missed it entirely because I just wasn't really on reddit for a few days. \n\nBy the time I realized an event was even happening it was practically over. By the responses here, some people are finding out right now as it's already over. It stands to reason you have thousands and thousands of active players who literally never had a clue an event was happening.",
            "So do they take a while to be delivered? I have no way of knowing whether I did participate or not (I did see the posts, and I did play the event twice and popped the BAD about 300 times total). I entered the game and didn't receive anything automatically. Do I have to do something specific?",
            "Did anyone get the rewards yet or did my stuff not count for some reason?",
            "I received mine just now, but no race passes. Is the descrtiption wrong?",
            "I didn't get my race passes :(",
            "This was trash. Very badly advertised. No ingame signposts and so many people didn't know about it even those who frequent reddit. If I didn't know any better I'd think it was done intentionally so NK didn't have to give out more valuable rewards.",
            "I glanced the reddit post announcing this, but didn't know what it was or when it started. I was waiting for the in-game announcement/popup but I guess there just never was one. \ud83e\udd37\n\nEven more confusing because the main menu only changed to birthday decorations today/yesterday. Was it some kind of pre-party thing? Guess I'll have nothing.",
            "Have the rewards been sent out yet, if so how do you claim them? I participated and haven\u2019t recovered anything",
            "ninjakiwi i love your game but this event was insultingly bad in it\u2019s management. The update didnt even roll out until milestone 4 on some devices and the complete lack of in game discoverability in a game many kids play is astounding lack of awareness. would have loved to felt like i participated but you guys didnt give it enough effort and thought for everyone to have that opportunity\u00a0",
            "you guys did a great job at making sure this event had as little hype as possible only posting it to reddit. Most people either didn't know about the event or didn't know how to participate in it which is a very poor design choice. \"But it was just to test how active the reddit community was!\" is not a very good excuse as there were rewards (albeit very mediocre rewards minus the racepasses) that a lot of people missed out on because of this.",
            "Where do we go to recieve the rewards?",
            "How many pops were needed for the last milestone?",
            "what was the last O\\_O",
            "Got chommed",
            "I'm glad to have played this game 1 year after it's released. Principally that I recorded it, good times.",
            "yay we did it",
            "Damn, I missed it :'c",
            "What event?",
            "Man, really wish I had known about this! I've played every day but didn't know that there was an event at all. I've just been black bordering beginner maps like a CHIMPS chump and missed out on the sweet rewards",
            "When will the rewards be sent out?",
            "Finally got the rewards and I got the last banana farm insta I needed to gold border it! Best anniversary ever",
            "How do you participate?",
            "Well, I didn't realize it was already over. Oops",
            "We're the rewards distributioted, because I haven't received them yet?",
            "Is this why there was a birthday cake instead of the daily chest? I even checked events tab in game and there was nothing. I'm so confused.",
            "I just saw the cake appear yesterday, I have not seen any event in game to participate in. Just discovering this page while looking for information on what if anything is happening for an event during the anniversary.",
            "I had a lot of fun doing this.  I averaged 17 BAD kills for most games but I somehow got 38 one time.  No idea what I did differently and never came close to that again.\n\nCant wait for next year!",
            "I popped the party BAD 20 or so times does that mean I get rewards",
            "huh",
            ":3",
            "How did we play in the event? I couldn\u2019t figure out how to play it.",
            "how were we supposed to sign up?",
            "I didn't even know how to get onto this",
            "Wait, there was a community event?",
            "When do I get the rewards? I participated but I still didn\u2019t get anything when do I get them aaaa",
            "I didn\u2019t even know this was happening until I came to Reddit. So how do we get all the prizes?",
            "when should i end up getting my rewards bc i haven\\`t gotten anything yet and if people have already got their rewards can someone tell me how to get them",
            "Oops I missed it. Sorry guys",
            "I do not understand how to do that",
            "Next event should be at least 1k MM per milestone. Do you finish it all give 10k. Help noobs that are into this sort of thing get their MK and heroes.\u00a0\n\nAlso, no secret codes through the event??!!",
            "Why was this Reddit exclusive\u2026 finding out now sucks.",

            "If you look at the image, there's 7 T5 instas and 4 monkey knowledge points, wich weren't included in the rewards list, not saying that's the exact quantity that was going to be added, but it's likely that both mk points and T5 instas were the reward",
            "Also even people on Reddit being confused. There are comments every post saying they can't find the quest, not realizing it was the birthday BAD quest they added a while ago",
            "Pretty sure it being a reddit only thing was the whole point. I imagine they are trying to get advertising analytics.",

            "Didn't even know this was happening, kinda sad that I missed it",
            "It was more of a reddit community event than an ingame thing. I get what they were trying to do with getting this place involved but it does mean that less people will know/participate and it's kinda weird to do it for an anniversary.",
            "Here I am on Reddit no idea what the event was, great.",

            "Aw damn, I didn't know there was an event going on until I saw the cake, didn't know I had to do anything or get rewards (no I didn't read any pop-ups that may have appeared when I opened the app so this is entirely my fault)",
            "Really? The way it was stated in the third milestone announcement, it made it sound like we had to manually submit the info. At least, that is how I interpreted it.",
