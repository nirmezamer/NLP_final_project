That could be an interesting storyline, and its one that I feel like Oda is trying to set up.\n\nOne random thought I had too is that this arc is turning out to be a great training arc for Gear 5.  He's had to go in and out of G5, fight, take multiple hits, and refuel multiple times.  He's pulling new moves out of nowhere, learning to conserve and refill his stamina and also finding out what his awakening can actually do.

Seeing how much the story is about parallels, it wouldn't be unlikely for Joy Boy's pirate crew to mirror Luffy's. \n\nThis chapter confirms that the giant is a thinking being with what seems to be individuality. What if he was Franky's equivalent in Joy Boy's crew ? Someone who has gone full machine with the help of the advanced Void Century tech, allowing him to survive on low power mode until today.",

            "I firmly believe that Nika is the origin of all Devil Fruits, and that Joyboy's ability to bring whatever he imagined to reality (sortof) ended up being manifested into the devil fruits after his death. The Devil Fruit Encyclopedia was probably made by World Government so they could track down, record, and counter any devil fruit they came across reminiscent of Nika's powers during the Void Century, only leaving out the Gomu Gomu No Mi specifically so readers who would pursue the devil fruits would never know or go after the Gomu Gomu No Mi.\n\nThe only common factor that actually ties them together to their origin with Nika isn't exactly the \"rejection by Nature\" stated by Vegapunk, but from the fact that he couldn't swim due to his body being rubber, the only thing that translated into every devil fruit.\n\nTwo examples off the top of my head would be Bonney and Kaido's DFs, Bonney's is pretty explanatory as we see as she is capable of replicating rubber attacks. But with Kaido, there's really only one hint... how he moves. Very specifically, when he imitates Jet Culverin, just like how he states that rubber shouldn't be able to work in the way Luffy uses it, a body like that can't make such sharp movements identical to rubber.\n\nTransforming the body, affecting the environment, and the only limit is their own imagination? What greater turmoil would such power unleashed on the world for anyone to use be?  What greater threat to the divine presence of the Imu, the Gorosei, the Celestial Dragons, and the World Government, than an entire people with powers like Nika? And what better name to give a food that threatens the heavens, than the ***Devil Fruit?***",

Doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll have rubber abilities or be able to \u201ccopy\u201d Luffy in fighting style or anything; she\u2019s effectively just a giant.

I literally don't understand how people don't like this, especially as the limitless potential of her devil fruit has been showcased and hinted at several times now.\n\nAlso the \"countdown\" of Vegapunks feels very death-flaggy. I'd be shocked if both the Satellites survived. I think only one will make it out, and it'll be their trump to countering York on the WG's side. I bet it'll be Lilith, considering she's the one we met first and has the most rapport with the crew - but I could see it potentially being Atlas!",

There's also Tonjit's explanation of how Long Ring Long Land works, with the creatures naturally stretching (as well as Chopper and Usopp in a goofy scene).\n\nI had been throwing around the idea in my head that Luffy will eventually be able to grant that level of freedom to other people for a few weeks now, and I believe it fully now. I think that by the end we are going to see all of the Straw Hats in a \"Nika-ish\" form and that its actually the form humanity was always supposed to have before some unknown event with the void century and the world government.\n\nI can foresee Luffy doing something like  (Naruto Ending and Black Clover Manga Spoilers)>!How Naruto shares his Chakra with all of his friends or how Asta in Black Clover grants the Black Bulls Anti-Magic Power!<.",

Here's my thoughts and reading of it.\n\nThematically this chapter is perfect cause it shatters the \"luffy is a chosen one\" narrative. In my reading, this is a visual representation of how all of us and everyone in the OP world has it in us to be nikas. To be warriors of liberation. Just cause luffy has the fruit doesnt make him any more special than anyone else. He just happens to be freedom and the striving for freedom personified, and in philosophical terms this chapter signifies bonneys journey from childish romanticism to existentialist freedom. She goes from losing her innocence and being unable to transform as saturn brings her down from romantic innocence and transcendance to grim reality. In this chapter, shes spiralling towards nihilism, believing theres no point and she cannot be free, she cannot be nika. Luffy is a nietzsche-esque figure bringing the proclamation that \"life is meaningless, Rejoice!\" . In other words, hes informing her that there is nothing essential about being free. Its not a matter of whether you can or cannot do it. Everyone is and always has been free to make their own meaning and decide for themselves who and what they are. All core ideas of existentialism.\n\nShe decides and is responsible for herself. If she wants to be nika, the embodiment of freedom, then she can.

            "One reason imo is that the truth to who holds the strongest minds/creativity/imagination are children. Because Bonney is still a child, despite all the trauma she's gone through, the will hasn't been completely beaten out of her. Even when it happens, children bounce back again and again and again until they just can't anymore.... by the time they reach teen years and adulthood years, if all they experienced was disappointments, it's much harder to bounce back from that. \n\nRobin is a good example of this because it took like 28 years of existence before she met the Straw Hats, and building and recovering that trust and inner-world was much harder then. Same can be applied for Nami who was I think 18? As well as Sanji who went through so much as a child, survived it, and then went through yet again another traumatic experience with Zeff, and then ignored all that until he had to face his past in WCI. It heavily affected his mental state and his ability to make healthier decisions because trauma by adulthood is not functionable.\n\n  \nIt isn't functionable for children either of course, but I've seen this with children and when I was a kid, how much I'd bounce back and restore my faith in humanity/myself by myself, for no good reason at all, other than to hold onto hope. Anyway, to me this is why Bonney is able to back bounce so quick and suddenly gain that confidence and ability to transform into Nika (because children have limitless potential and imagination). Even when she told Luffy she couldn't keep up with him in that form, there were no sweat marks that usually indicate a nervousness/insecurity/etc (this emoji \ud83d\ude05 lol). Usually someone would have some level of insecurity and express that emoji when acknowledging there's no way they could keep up with Nika form let alone against literally demons lol. Children can feel that sense of comparing oneself to others of course, but again I hope you get my point. Children rule. It's both amazing and incredibly tragic that Bonney is currently TWELVE \ud83d\udc80\n\n  \nI also think Oda is aware that we the individuals living here on hell-like earth, need genuine hope right about now and the messaging with Bonney and the iron giant is pure gold for that. The concept that \"there's Luffy who can save us and that's it\" is instantly rewritten with \"you can be Nika too\" which is the whole point of Nika- to inspire confidence and freedom to everyone, to empower others. Bonney, a 12-year-old character who deserves to show the world what is possible when you tap into a potential future that WASN'T fked up by dystopia, further unrecoverable trauma and abuse, and corruption, is the perfect way to represent that. I often wish I had a different upbringing. I can see exactly how, when, and where my childhood stripped any bit of potential I had and did everything in their power to kill it. The gorosei successfully did this to Bonney's entire life and her family. It's incredible she gets to finally get a brighter future and I'd like to believe she's going to either stay with Luffy, or find somewhere safe to live with Kuma (if that's even possible with his current state) much like Rebecca+Kyros. I'd love to see her stick with Luffy between those two ideas though.",

            "Remember, there was no flashback before Vegapunk \"died\". \ud83d\ude02",
            "Thematically, this chapter perfectly encapsulates what One Piece is about, and especially what is being built since the reveal of G5.\n\nMy personal theory: The reason the elders and the WG want to get rid of the fruit so badly is not only because of what it symbolizes or the power it gives to the user, but because it can also power up other people around it. The drums of liberation not only inspire people, they give them the tools to free themselves.\n\nI am **not** saying that Luffy has the power to give anyone G5. However, I do think his awakened form can power up people in multiple ways if they are inspired enough by it.\n\nBonney's fruit for example. She can tap into potential futures, unless she learns the truth and cannot believe it will happen. She turns into a Nika form multiple times, although she only takes the rubber characteristics, because that is all she knows about him at that point. Once Saturn tries to break her spirit and tell her Nika isnt real, she conjures a very weak form, because she doesnt fully believe a \"Nika future\" is possible.\n\nHowever, now that she **sees** right in front of her that Nika is very much real, and that liberation is possible, she manages to come up with a fully \"free\" future of herself, which copies the physical characteristics of G5.\n\nThat, I believe, is Nika's true power. Luffy isnt simply metaphorically freeing people, he inspires freedom to the point that they get powered up as well. I dont know how this would interact with other devil fruits, or with those who have no devil fruits at all, but I believe this wont be the last time someone seeing G5 will gain themselves a new form as a result.",
            "Bonney is starting to really seem like the last crew member under the title of \"luffy's protege\" \n\nShe's the youngest person there and luffy seems keenly interested in teaching her how to stand up for herself and be free.  He was showing her how to throw a punch a few chapters back and now he coached her into being a nika herself.",
            "Everyone is too busy on Bonney but what about the last bit of vegabunk recording saying among u there are\u2026.and their names are\u2026. And the recording cuts off\nDoes that mean there is sort of other major figures besides joy boy that the D clan members inherits their will.",
            "The real question is: does Bonney just appear as Nika or have Nika powers",
            "I love how amongst all the tradegy \u00a06 years old bonney faced, she has the power of becoming whatever future she envisions herself. This is poetic.",
            "This chapter just proves, just like back in Wano, that a lot of OP fans can't read.\n\nWe literally dee Bonney turn Luffy into his old man self from the bad timeline.\nWe see her use a weaker version of the Muscle Muscle form in her \"Nika-like future\".\nWe literally see Bonney turn into a giant, an entirely different race.\n\nHow the hell some people are acting as if this came out of nowhere?\n\nBtw, each time, her power lasted for a very short time, far shorter than Luffy's so calm your panties powerscalers\n\n\n\nAlso, this moment isn't about a power up for Bonney. If you were actually paying attention, you'd see how connected Nika is to Bonney's family. How the idea of Nika finally setting them free was around from Kuma's childhood.\n\nBonney becoming Nika for a moment isn't a power up to day \"Bonney is top 5!!!\". It's a cathartic moment for her whole family and them finally being free from being slaves and victims of the WG.\n\nThat's why this is Bonney at her most free (and there is no one freer than Joyboy/Nika), why the flashback to Kuma talking to Ginny exists, and why Bonney heavily resembles her mother in her Nika form.",
            "How I see the \"Is Bonney OP and can she literally do anything and copy any fruit\" debate:\n\nBonney's distorted future is based on if she believes that future is possible. As she learns more about how things work her distorted transformations become more limited as she will no longer believe them to be possible. E.g. if she knew for a fact and she believed people couldn't grow an extra arm later in life, she wouldn't be able to distorted future where she had 3 arms.\n\nCan she copy any devil fruit power? This is unclear because we don't know if she knows people can only eat one devil fruit. If she knew this then she cannot believe in any future where she is using someone else's devil fruit powers (unless she also knows blackbeard has two).\n\n\"But what about Nika transformation, she is copying Luffy's DF powers\" Yes, we as readers know this, but Bonney would have to know this too. The only people we have seen talk about the fruit are the elders who know its the nika fruit and Vega Punk who said the gum gum fruit isn't in the old devil fruit books.\n\nLuffy isn't telling her \"This is just my gum gum fruit gear 5 form\", he is saying \"this is how i look when i am totally free\". It is entirely possibly in Bonney's child mind that there is a disconnect between this transformation and his fruit.\n\nNow back to the blackbeard thing I mentioned earlier: If she knows about Blackbeard having two powers then all bets are off. Nobody knows how he did this. Is it special to him because of his body, is it special to him because of his fruit or can anyone potentially do this? Without knowing the how but knowing someone has done it, this would open her back up to seeing a possible future where she has another power.\n\n\nSo to all the people saying \"can she just say give me a magma future and get lava powers\" I would say possibly but it's unclear, depending on what she actually knows about DF.\n\n And I wouldn't be shocked if an elder literally tries to tell her during the fight that she cannot be nika because of XYZ and possibly breaking that belief and forcing her to de-transform.",
            "People are missing the thematic nature of Bonney transforming into Nika. Her powers limit is her belief a future event could have ever happened. So with Luffy telling her that anything is possible she believed she could trully become free. In doing so she turned herself into the person who is the most free, turning herself into Nika. We have seen Bonney use her powers in similar fashion but she lacked the conviction to go all in until Luffy encouraged her. Now that she trully believes she can be Free she is able to become Nika. Powerscallers themselves put limits on characters which is the opposite of what Nika is about. He is the God of Liberation, the one who will free all the people's of the One Piece world from the yoke of the World Government. Bonney turning into Nika is but the first step towards a Liberated future.",

My money is on him doing some sort of sacrifice that allows everyone to escape. \n\nMaybe finally time for logia awakening? If logia awakening is what Akainu and Aokiji used during their battle on Punk Hazard, then something that bathes Egghead in light would also be symbolic of the Sun God's victory. At a minimum, Kizaru has to do something else this arc given how much characterization and flashback he's gotten at Egghead.",

            "Been seeing Bonney using her fruit to spread G5 theories and I think it's extremely plausible. While it makes more sense for Bonney to simply be able to force Gear 5 on people with insufficient haki to resist, it's possible that a Nika distorted future requires someone to be in the right state of mind to access. If this is the case, then Bonney could end up with the Revolutionaries, since Belo Betty could use her fruit to get people in the correct Nika-ish mindset. The Revo's being able to instantly create an army of Yonko-tier combatants at any kingdom they visit would dissolve the WG in no time, especially if they can get Kuma active again, which might be why the CD's have the drastic measure of destroying all life on the planet. We've already seen Cross Guild give the marines trouble; the Revo's might very well defeat every Admiral and demolish the entirety of the Marines as an institution before tackling Mary Geosse.",

I doubt Mars is going to kill her seeing as how Luffy and Bonney are probably going to beat the crap out of him next chapter.\n\nI'm more concerned about Lilith. She's currently grouped with some of the weaker Straw Hats while Zoro and Jinbe are away from them. Assuming Zoro can deal with Nusjuro by himself, that means 3/5 Elders are probably going to be gunning for Lilith, Nami, Robin, Usopp, Chopper, Brook, and debatably Jinbe if he shows. That's more than Lilith's side can handle. Hell even if Lucci, Kaku, and Stussy decide to help them out, 3 Elders still feels like way too much for them.",

Bonney at the Reverie then Stussy getting her first moment hinting at what we were doing recently with her in the Kuma flashback. \n\nI still think we'll get back to some of that as the broadcast finally fades out. Because this chapter has the stuff floating around that ties it altogether. You're not entirely wrong to think this is kinda silly and gratuitous, our first lesson of Zoan awakenings is there's a danger of losing yourself to them and you have the Giants playing with that idea right before the big climax. To me it's one of those things were you maybe can't see the full ending just yet but you can see the type of twist it's setting up, the big mystery is still what happened last night and the stuff around that.",

The bulk of her character was introduced this arc, and most of that coming in the last 20ish chapters, and now she's suddenly a massive piece of the puzzle. And most of the stuff we know about her is from the flashback that's from *Kumas* perspective, we only got like 1-2 chapters of Bonneys perspective \n\n2) lackluster buildup in this chapter, the actual transformation happens kinda suddenly in a situation where it felt like the strawhats had the upper hand anyways. All it takes is basically two simple sentences and boom the transformation happens\n\nI expected some type of Bonney -Nika stuff coming, but this just kinda feels off because it feels so soon and kinda like overkill given the situation.

            "For anyone curious, I posted an objective analysis using Color Law that will explain why Bonney is as powerful as she is. Observing Color Law allows you to understand literally any story, and you will come to an absolute understanding of how and why characters act they way they do because of it. The simple answer for Bonney is, it's because of the colors she was given, which represent the objective story roles a character has and will undoubtedly follow no matter what. Here's the analysis for her colors.\n\n\nBonney's pink hair gives her the proactive story role of being dedicated towards something and someone. Hair color also dictates the type of origin story that character has, and the origin of one with pink hair is also one where the dedication of that character is based on the opposite of their origin, which we know for Bonney is by being born from the celestial dragons, but Bonney herself absolutely opposes them. Bonney's personal dedication is, as you guessed, Kuma. (side note, think about Big mom's origins and you'll see what I mean.)\n\n\nThe type of power pink gets in a story is considered open ended, as pink is the story role and color adjacent to blue (who has a similar type of power, but the rules behind it are different). the potential of that said power is based entirely on how motivated that character is at that moment (think about Koby with his Honest Impact earlier this arc). The color that determines how motivated that character can be and how they use their power is based on their eye color.\n\n\nBonney has purple eyes, which gives her the reactive story role of causing conflict, but also being the the one to resolve them, and hiding a secret (purple eyes means that the character reveal the secret themselves, in this case it's the fact that Kuma is Bonney's father). if purple was the hair color, then the type of power purple has is considered one that is overwhelmingly strong, but also hard to control. So when purple is an eye color, it uses their hair's power in an overwhelmingly strong way, but it can be hard to control, but based on the hair color, some stability can be possible.\n\n(side note, a character with silver hair with purple eyes is an example of a character being able to control their power and can go overboard with it freely, though initial training is usually involved beforehand. Examples would be Noelle Silva from black clover and Enrico Pucci from JoJo.)\n\n\nIn Bonney's case, she needed a clear idea on the type of future that can give her one that resembles Nika. The fact that all she needs to do is think of something a certain way is certainly representative of an open ended power based on being dedicated towards something, so to have an very emotional color like purple who can utilize that power in an overwhelmingly strong way, we get the result we see here, ANOTHER FREAKING NIKA like damn I felt like I Should've seen this coming but I didn't think it would go this far and I'm super excited to see what Bonney ends up doing in her new form.\n\n\nMaybe only day I'll find the time to objectively explain why Luffy acts the way he does in gear 5th (obvious hint, its due to his colors and hairstyle changing). someday the time will be right.",

Is Vegapunk actually deserving to die, for his \"sins\"? \n\n\"Unclear justice\", indeed.\n\nI've long thought of the admirals as a very nicely crafted themeatic element that they are \"forces of nature\". In one sense that dovetails with the way Logia powers were introduced to the story, and though they don't have a monopoly on them, they do take the concept one step further when it comes to just how daunting it is to face them. Earlier in the story, an admiral being in play was a sign that the situation is truly hopeless. The theme also extends to drive home just how much of a beast Garp is, that he was considered for promotion but refused for ethical reasons, and it's also nicely fleshed out with the addition of Fujitora with his on-theme paramecia.\n\nNow that the story has reached a point where that thematic wall has been passed, I'm very interested in how Kizaru ends up. Kizaru feels to me like he's due for a retirement, and I expect it to happen on his terms. Earlier in the arc I was imagining he'd end up sort of breaking off to go be the \"don't bother us\" factor for the \"Vegapunk family\", but now it feels like that group is going to be more a few scattered individuals.\n\nI wonder if he could end up awakening and in the process just sort of ascending to a level that's like, scarier that admirals currently are, but also in a zen-like way just becoming a presence, rather than a player. Like, anywhere the sun is shining he's \"present\", but maybe he's just kind of screwing off, doing the Nika dance, casting shadows in that likeness and in theory able to manifest and wreck things, but... will he? Unclear.",

But I don't think that your explanation answers the questions you attempted to answer. \n\nYou just talked about her story arc and character growth story beats, that wouldn't actually explain WHY she CAN become nika. It justifies why from a writing perspective it makes sense that she would.  It doesn't explain Why she has the ability to do so. \n\nThe explanation for why she can become nika, is because her devil fruit has the pretty crazy ability to let her age herself  and not just into an older version of the current Bonney, but into any future version of herself that she has the ability to believe in. That's why when Nika-Luffy had that moment with her, she could then become a version of herself like that too.",

            "> How come Bonney can become Gear 5. Could her Devil Fruit pull from different timelines? One where she eats the Nika Nika no mi instead of Luffy?\n\nHer fruit operates on belief in potential futures. Nika inspires her to believe in a future where she has the powers of Nika. She borrows from that future, and a form where she is Nika manifests. If she truly believed that one day she'll have Kizaru's fruit, she might be able to manifest a lightspeed punch.",

Its possible the legend of joyboy and nika were created around the fruit and possibly not the other way around. What made the fruit special is that the only two known users of said fruit were warriors of liberation, Luffy and Joyboy. Although i admit this thought has its flaws esp with how weve seen G5 with the clouds on his back unlike doffy/law/kidd with their awakened paramecia\n\nedit: also bonney being able to access this nika form is funny because when she thought of a nikaish future, she did not look like nika(probably because she did not realise G5 was how it looked like). Could lend more to the fact that truly This awakening form is not neccessarily that of the sun god nika but what joyboy and now luffy make of it, their ideas of absolute freedom.

            "Personally I don't see them as cornered at all, especially when Luffy alone is enough to handle Mars and Sanji is there too but he's not doing anything. I think they were actually cornered earlier in the arc when all 5 gorosei pulled up, or when it was Saturn and Kizaru against them. This feels like they're almost home free and they need one last push.",
            "What's wrong with G5?",
            "Yea but thing is with Bonney is that the anime has her with purple eyes and her reactive story role follows the story role of purple exactly. It's the same with how Araki will color his characters any way he likes on cover pages and the like, but he has to give the anime producers certain colors that actually represent the objective story roles that character was given. It is interesting that Oda changes up the colors for some of his characters, like he did for Law by changing his hair iirc but just like Bonney, the colors that Law has in the anime are the ones that represent his objective story roles. \n\nAs much as I feel like I should be following the manga's colors, by observing Color Law over time I've come to understand that the story is actually bigger than the author themselves.\n\nSo for your examples, I know for a fact that Natsu and Itadori share the same story roles when it comes the combination of their hair color (the proactive story role that the story gives the character and the character themselves are aware of it) and their eye color (the reactive story role that represents the characters own personal arc and growth). Since storytelling is a subjective act, they clearly won't act the same way since that is entirely dependent on the author (and the hairstyle of the character but I won't go into that for now) but these characters do follow the same objective path and will hit similar crossroads, but it will just be told in a different way. \n\n\nBrown is a special color in storytelling since it is the representation of realism, whereas the colors on the typical color wheel represent idealism. When brown interacts with an idealistic color, it \"hinders\" the role of that color, making it act outside of its objective purpose. This means that with pink's role of dedication, a character with pink hair and brown eyes would be one who doesn't stick to being dedicated to one thing, but would rather take on multiple things or people to dedicate themselves to. This also causes that character to lose motivation easily, as ideally the story role of pink sticks to one thing and person to be dedicated to and they will put their absolute all into it. Pretty idealistic outlook, right? This is what makes brown such a fun color to observe in storytelling because it forces every color it interacts with to act outside of its objective, idealistic role.\n\nWith Kakyoin though, he does have pink hair, but his eyes are considered burnt orange, so he would have the reactive story role of desire and naivety, which are the objective story roles of orange. I don't recall Kakyoin doing anything where his reactions would be considered part of the role of brown.\n\nAnd for Madoka, she seems to be someone with both pink hair and pink eyes and from what I remember from watching it years ago, yea Madoka would definitely have to have pink eyes in order to pull off what she did in that anime and movie.",

Personally, the second we first saw distorted future, I saw this coming, and when it was revealed by Saturn that Bonnie's perception of reality affected her powers, it 100% cemented that when she saw luffy in action she would mimic G5. I thought this was well developed storytelling and really completes Bonnie's growth in the arc in a way that complements Kuma's backstory in a really satisfying way. These are the kind of stories I've enjoyed in one piece since I started reading in 2006, and the reason I am still reading (I took a 3 year hiatus I hated punk hazard so much mind you lol so I can't judge anyone reacting). Different enjoyment reasons are why people are reacting, just like when G5 was revealed or when Luffy and Lucci fought on egghead or when Greenbull was spooked by shanks. Weekly reading as opposed to reading in bulk changes the way we take things in as well. I first caught up in Marine Ford and mentioned I got so fed up by Punk Hazard I quit for years, lol.

I feel like VP's message just meant it more broadly, as in \"fighting\" against Ds and cause the other 2 ancient weapons are still around ready to be awakened/born), Enel with weatherian/Birkans technology since he's from there, defeating Urouge, them coming back to relevance in Elbaf those are things that I've considered extremely plausible for a long time and wouldn't be surprised if they turned out to be true",

What is this name never heard of this\" I guess it's a wrong theory.\n\nBut hey..

Clearly, a \"god\" like himself would live in such a sacred place.  \n\nAnother thing about the shadows Cricket talks about is about the sky islands which have existed for a long, long time.  While the all but confirmed Uranus, sacred treasure of Marijoa, does produce the same shadow as sky islands two things can do the same thing.

            "I think the biggest problem with Level 6 is its execution. The overall idea is that when all physical torture doesn't work, you go with psychological. Level 6 would have made much more sense if it was complete sensory deprivation. No light. No sound. No contact. No food. You just waste away with nothing. The fact that they're all kept in cells within eyeshot of each other or in many cases, with cell mates, really negates the impact of Level 6. I guess it was tough to convey, but it definitely feels like a let down after all the previous levels.",

Being stuck with nothing but themselves and no worldly possessions, no friends, no one to really talk to. They can only contemplate their actions. Can accept make peace and possibly reach a stage where won't need the world and the world won't need them. Having Sengoku as head of marines might have been part of why I am thinking that. \n\nBasically each layer is a condition they use to temper the body and  to extremes. Physical discomfort, fear, hunger, heat, cold, Tolerate extreme conditions physically so body is a peak condition and all that is left is the mind which is given nothing but itself to work on.",

So what\u2019s so bad about this level?  \n\nNothing. \n\nIt\u2019s literally nothing. The most they would get is food, just to keep them going at minimum energy. The ultimate torture for the ultimate criminals.\n\nBoredom.",

It\u2019s possibly he \u201cjumped the line\u201d so to speak since he was an important prisoner, but it feels very much like the WG to have a backlogged and unorganized death row.\n\nWe see Roger in some sort of cell as well talking to Garp, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s impale down or not, but we do know they tend to lock you up before killing.",

Imagine the prisoners knowing some sort of secret and it gets released on the execution platform.. WG won't want that.\n\nCroc knew about Pluton while Doffy knew about Mary Geoise's secret. Even WB's death led to an increase in piracy due to his last words.\n\nIn the OP world, there will always be people who follow you and the ideologies you leave behind\n\nEven secret executions can make you question the truth behind it which other factions can use to their advantage against the WG",

To the extent that the WG can control it, your notoreity is erased when you\u2019re jailed in that level.

            "not even a prisoner necessarily. Its likely he was just under arrest until after the execution. Sengoku still considered him a warlord when they arrived at marinefort.",
            "then they SHOULD execute those people, have multiple fruit around and use those powers to strenghten the marines.\n\nWhy are people so sure that it workls exactly that way, even if it was only shown ONCE during a controlled experiment?",
            "Ah, right, forgot about him\n\n\nStill, the point stands that DF respawns probably aren't the main reason to keep'em alive in level 6, given the majority of BBs crew",

            "Because we also know Blackbeard was somehow able to take whitebeards fruit power and is actively hunting down and taking them, so presumably he also has a way to make it respawn nearby",
            "Jesus also tried to kill them with a knife, just like Teach killed Thatch.\n\nDoesn't mean a lot, yet.",
            "true, but then again, if that is indeed how it works and its common knowledge the marines would definitly abuse that system",
