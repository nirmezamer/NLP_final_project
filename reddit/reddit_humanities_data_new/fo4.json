            ">Vault 76 is also mentioned in the mothership zeta expansion for FO3.\n\nTo give some potential credibility to people hoping/expecting 5 to feature San Francisco, the equivalent of this would possibly be Nuka World featuring the Hubologists.\n\nHubologists was an opposing faction for the Shi in Fallout 2. The Shi are in San Francisco and mentioned by Kellogg. Additionally, although less noteworthy, there's a Shi skin for some items in 76.\n\nI say it's likely but far from a guarantee.",

Like after 10 missions doing the Lord's work for the BOS, maybe he starts to lighten up some. Then once I take Bunker Hill with them he's even cooler, might even like me some. Then when. I bring down the prydwyn and kill everyone in the faction he's back to square one",

            "He\u2019s helped thousands reduce stress and should be thanked for it. Having a bad day! Start of course with the fat man but then get creative. Junk jet, drug him with the syringes, flame on, baseball launcher. Go for the legs, five grenades. The fun never ends. Get a new weapon? Fast travel quick save try it on Rhys.",
            "Honestly though, unless you side with the brotherhood in the end. He's not exactly wrong about you, in his defence",
            "Can't you just \"eliminate\" the rudeness once all his missions are done?",

            "lol i just quicksave and shoot the shit out of him whenever he says something rude, but i might do this next time",
            "So is he just always a dick? Or does he eventually warm up",
            "He is rude!  He gives you this half-assed apology after you're promoted to Sentinel and then goes right back to giving you missions with snark and attitude attached.  Grrrrr Rhys",
            "Fair",
            "I sometimes wish I could jail him like Clarke for Insubordination. \n\nIs there a mod for that?",
            "I do this for the Prydwen. Every visit nets me 3 new PA suits, around 4-6 cores, a dozen lasers and respective ammo.\n\nExcept I stealth kill every unnamed person instead of pickpocketing them.",

            "He is nasty, I think everyone will agree, In FO3 you could sneak up on someone, put a live grenade into their inventory & blow them to bits.  Don't know you can in FO4 but it would be fun.",
            "Slip a grenade into his pocket (preferably nuclear)",
            "I believe you can punch him once or twice without him becoming hostile, if you are unarmed. But better save first, just in case. :)",

            "I hate Scribe Haylen more. When i 1st talk to her that dialog I say Suits me fine, she says, You dont sound so sure. WTF? So hes a cocky Knight, I like that in a guy. And then I take a mission, and Haylen immediatly sandbox into me and bitch about me still being there. Its been only a split second since i got my orders. With Ryse I can take it, but from Haylen it cat fighting time. lol",

            "They are radiant quests, they repeat forever.\n\nHe does change after you become a sentinel and talk to him... but right after that conversation he goes back to his usual behaviour.",
