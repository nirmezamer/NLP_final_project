As the goal of this post is to increase the community's knowledge, the thought process matters as much as the answer!

            "I started playing about a month ago and just hit legend for the first time, what are some tips on how to improve more? I feel like playing ranked will only get me so far as I am surely making lots of mistakes but don't know how to identify them",
            "Hi there i have three questions :)\n\nAfter you get all the minisets as a new player which packs should you get the one from the expansion you like or from the latest set.\n\nSecondly after the recent update my shop seems to be closed does anything know how to fix this i play on pc.\n\nLastly how do i get a reddit avatar.",
            "Hi, just started the game and I was reading that u get a legendary for the first 10 packs you buy.\n\nI opened a legendary from one of the free packs from the apprentice track, does it count? Or do I still get a confirmed legendary if I buy 10 packs from the store?",
            "Hi just got into Hearthstone the other week, for some reason I was under the impression that a new expansion is released every year. But we have an upcoming expansion this July, so just wondering how often do expansions release? Would also like to ask how often seasons refresh as well. Thanks! :D",
            "Would it be better to save the standard red packs for a chance of getting cards from future expansion?",
            "Does anyone know how long buddies will be in battlegrounds?",
            "How should I start building a collection and making somewhat decent deck as a returning player? Seems hard at the moment to figure out what to pick or be able to get good cards",
            "I recently started playing hearthstone again, just battlegrounds for now \n\nIs there no way for me to get older bartenders? Is the only way to get new ones is by buying the battle pass? Same goes for the strike animations?",
            "How long is Genn and Baku in standard?",
            "Came back to the game about 2 months ago after a few years break. Just wanted to say. As a f2p player that only plays one class. I dust all of the cards from other ones to keep up with new stuff. This new expansion literally kills the game for me. Sad times, It's been fun while it lasted. Gonna miss this community.",
            "Is there a way to reset my MMR? I'm a returning player after many years and can't win a single game at the 9 star bonus. I am not good at this game, but keep being thrown against players that are.",
            "What loaner deck to choose? I liked the DK one, but someone told me the warrior one is the closest to a meta deck. So, what deck has the best value?",
            "Hi, i made an account about a week or so ago, maybe ten days ago. \n\nToday i was playing, got to high diamond then went on to do some IRL stuff.\n\nWhen i came back i found my account banned and a mail from blizzard saying i have been botting. \n\nThe only thing that i can conceive being the reason is that i installed firestone: i thought it was safe since they say so on their website and i saw some popular streamers use it.\n\nIs this the reason i got banned?\n\nIf it can't be this, what can i do to get my account back? In the mail they say they don't even look at appeals.",
            "why are my end of season rewards the new expansion packs instead of whiz bang packs*?* Is that a visual bug ? or do I just recieve new expansion packs 20+ days in advance and not be able to open them?",
            "I\u2019m a completely new player, i understand the mechanics of the game like spells/minions and stuff and kinda understand what every class do, but i\u2019m really lost at building or finding some good deck, or how to get good cards where should i spend gold (completely F2P) and i want to have at least some brief instructions on how to start and what should i do or what i shouldn\u2019t do. I like to play Paladin around that divine shields and i also find Druid interesting. I will be very thankful for ANY tips\ud83d\ude04",
            "[deleted]",
            "Is there some reason people in duo battlegrounds will just take the demons that damage on refresh or the blood money spell over and over with an otherwise blank board other than trolling?\n\nI've had 3 random people do it in the last few days.",
            "Some of the things that have helped me: slow down your decisions. It\u2019s easy to just toss cards out on curve, but if you take your time and consider alternatives you might start to see other lines you hadn\u2019t considered. Maybe the best play is to play no cards at all, or to float mana for a more optimal turn later. Or maybe there\u2019s a better order to play the cards in that will change your thinking, like drawing first in-case you draw a better play. Maybe your opponent is playing a certain kind of deck that always likes to do something on their next turn and you can disrupt it by playing your turn a different way.\n\nWatch streamers who are high on the ladder and try to play their turns out in your head. If they do something differently than you would, ask yourself why they made the play and if it\u2019s better than what you wanted to do. You can also ask them questions in chat and, depending on the streamer, some of them will be very responsive and explain why they made the play they did.\n\nAlso, after each game, win or lose, reflect on if you could have played the game any differently. Did you greed a particular turn and the tempo loss snowballed the game out of control? Did you waste an answer early that you needed later in the game and should have held for later? Did you misplay the order on any turns? Did you go face or trade and got punished for choosing wrong?\n\nThis is a lot of over simplification but a lot of it is I think learning to recognize the many different decisions you can make each game, and then reflecting on how you could do better next time. Best of luck! Congrats on hitting legend!",
            "You should open up 10 packs of each set so you can get the guaranteed legendary.\n\nIt's a known bug, sorry\n\nYou can change your appearance by clicking on your avatar. Or you can upload a custom image by going into profile settings",
            "It\u2019s in the first 10 packs of each type. So it depends on which type of pack(s) you opened.",
            "it doesn't matter how you get packs",
            "We get an expansion every 4 months, with a mini set two months into each expansion. The oldest 3 expansions rotate out around March/April every year. The ranked season refreshes every month on the 1st. The reward track refreshes every 4 months when the new expansions release.",
            "if you have the most cards of all current sets, this makes sense",
            "First of all focus on gaining exp -> gold. So, just play hearthstone.\n\n\n\u00a0You can try out battlegrounds, by the time you learn the ropes of that game mode you will have extra 1-2k gold.\n\n\n\u00a0With gained gold try out arena. You will lose a lot before getting good at it but you will be earning packs+dust+exp ether way.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Grind standard with spell mage deck, its one of the cheapest atm. It uses 0 legendaries or epic cards.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Next expansion launches after 1 month so I would avoid crafting expensive decks.(saving up some amount of gold before its launch is a good idea too)",
            "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way to get the old strike animations currently, but the old bartenders rotate though the shop so I think you should see them eventually. Yes, the new bartenders and strike animations generally come from the BGs pass or the shop and you have to spend money/runestones.",
            "Until the new expansion releases on July 23rd.",
            "It\u2019s only a few cards from one class, from only this expansion. I really don\u2019t think the tourist mechanic should kill the game for you, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at. We haven\u2019t seen many cards yet so maybe your favorite class won\u2019t even want to use the tourist cards.",
            "Just losing until your mmr drops enough or starting a new account. Not much else you can do.\n\nYour mmr might also be lower in another mode (wild, twist, etc.), so you could switch to another mode while you\u2019re learning.",
            "I went with the warlock one. Bought a few packs with the gold i had, dusted the legendaries and epics that aren't played in high tier decks and had enough dust to build fatigue warlock. I copied the list from Thijs's stream. Currently at 77.5% WR, high diamond in 43 games. Of the 9 games i lost 6 of them were th first few before i got a hang of the deck.",
            "Firestone won't get you banned. As you say there are many people and streamers using it, and it's totally safe to use.",
            "Yes, this is made especially for players. getting packs of a newer expansion is always better than getting an older one",
            "even 6 years ago, 95% of players reached legend rank without spending a penny. Paywall never existed.",
            "Opened 1 from whizbang and 1 from the standard red pack. So I won\u2019t get a confirmed legendary from buying another 10 from the store right",
            "Thanks!",
            "Thanks for replying! When does standard cards rotate out? Just dont want to build a deck and realize that cards I've used are actually gonna get rotated out like next month or something xD",
            "That\u2019s a good idea about trying another mode. I\u2019ve never played twist or wild, so if MMR doesn\u2019t carry across modes that might work great.",
            "Can you give a link or code to the warlock deck\n\n?",
            "Thank you for the information.\n\nIf i may ask, do you have any knowledge of what could possibly be happening?\n\nI find your app pretty great btw. Checking the match history in firestone, i can see that the games the app tracked are legit so i feel like my account has probably not been hacked. \n\nIs there anything i can do to find out what could be going on? I am pretty clueless",
            "Correct. But you would be guaranteed a legendary in the first 10 from other packs if you haven\u2019t opened a legendary from those sets yet. Like from Festival, Titans, and Showdown. It also works for gold packs which have a separate counter, but that probably isn\u2019t worth it for you because they\u2019re more expensive.",
            "In around March/April the oldest 3 expansions will rotate out, so Festival, Titans, and Showdown, will rotate out in around 9 months or so.",
            "I know it didn\u2019t used to, or at least not 1 to 1. I had a very high standard MMR and only a couple of stars in wild maybe a year ago.",
            "You can copy the list from the stream here:\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/2173403048\n\nThe time to see the full list is at 4:55:46 (4 hours 55 minutes and 46 seconds in the vod).\n\nThe deck has a very high floor high ceiling. Easy to pilot for quick wins just curving out as a zoo deck leveraging the fatigue 2 drop into trolley problem into crazed conductor. \n\nAgainst control decks like warrior if you don't have a perfect start or they have the parfect answer you need to be able to setup the combo win condition which means collecting crescendo, pop'gar, encroaching insanity and fizzle. Take a picture of at least 1 crescendo and 1 insanity (possibly pop gar and a void caller). Play the rest of the game pretending to care about the board state so that opponent need to answer it, then after you scaled up your fatigue you can burn them for 30+ in one turn using void caller, insanity, pop gar crescendo and 1 sludge. The third crescendo you play will burn them for 11 damage, crescendo should be roughly 12 and sludge is another 4. You can go higher damage if you have both crescendo or burn them in 2 turns, but it's all dependant on how the game went.",
            "I see, thanks a lot! In your opinion is it worth it to buy packs from the previous sets, they are the first to be rotated out at the next rotation right",
            "oh i see! thank you! :D",
            "That\u2019s true, they will rotate out in about 9 months. But that\u2019s still a long time, and the guaranteed legendary in the first 10 packs is high value. It\u2019s up to you of course, but you\u2019re going to need some of those cards in the next 9 months unless you\u2019re really picky about which decks you play. Minisets are also high value and a good thing to prioritize.",
            "Thanks a lot for the info and advice! Much appreciated"
