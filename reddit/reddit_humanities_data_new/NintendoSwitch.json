            "I have read the guides and googled and I\u2019m still confused, if not more. \nI have a Lite. Yesterday I got an OLED. I gave my daughter my Lite. She\u2019s playing Barbie on the Lite and I\u2019m trying to play a different game on the OLED and I can\u2019t. It kicks one of us off. We can\u2019t even play different games on each switch? And I can\u2019t transfer her games (Bluey, Peppa, and Barbie) to a new Nintendo user account, I\u2019d have to rebuy, correct? Either way we can\u2019t both play two different games at the same time unless I want to be out another $100+? Thanks!",
            "Oh boy did I get scared earlier today. I was playing Monster Hunter Rise, ranked up and talked to NPCs who had quests for me (keep in mind the game autosaves after each interaction), created custom food buff sets and took pictures with the ingame camera feature for one of these quests. I then proceeded to go on a quest and had to put my Nintendo Switch in sleep mode to do some chores.\n\n\n\nOnce I was able to play again I tried to wake up my Switch but nothing happened. The screen didn't brighten, plugging in the charger didn't cause any reaction and the only thing that helped was forcing the console to turn off and on my staying pressed on the power button for a while. Everything seemed normal, I did expect the game to be closed since the console restarted so I launched it again.\n\n\nThen I realized something was wrong. Loading up my save brought me back right before I talked to the NPCs, created my custom stuff ect. but it shouldn't be possible since the game autosaves after you do basically anything. What's weird is that I still had the pictures I took in the ingame gallery ! So I lost progress on what I did but still retained the pictures ? That's just weird.\n\n\nBecause I like to understand I tried to just close the game without going back to the main menu and see if indeed the autosave feature was just bugged and only completing quests saves the game but no, launched the game again after doing what I did previously and that time the progress didn't reset. This weird sleep crash my Switch experienced had this weird time-travel effect on my game I cannot comprehend.\n\n\nDoes the Switch have many different saves it keeps and in case the latest one corrupts an older one is used ? Please Nintendo Tech Bros, I need an answer for my sanity"

            "As a game designer, how do you feel out how hard to go on graphics? It looks like you put a lot of work into these environments which sometimes are just a background players walk past. Obviously the game looks very cool, but how do you balance the time and money it takes to get here? I assume this was planned and built into the game design documents?",
            "Are there any plans to bring Ravenlok to the Switch? I absolutely loved it. I also enjoyed Riverbond. Echo Generation is on my list to play!",
            "Congrats! The collectibles and pets sound like fun.\n\nAny particular inspirations? I\u2019m gonna guess Scooby Doo maybe \ud83e\udd14 \n\nWhat kind of pets are there in the game? \ud83d\ude0d",
            "Of all of the enemies in the game which one is a personal favourite of the dev team? Btw the game looks really good and I bet people would love to own it physical.",
            "I like the blocky but 3d style. What inspired this look, versus a full 3d (smooth) look?",
            "I love the art direction! Do you all have any plans for a physical release?",
            "I see here what some of what I assume are bosses look like, but what is the actual combat like? How's it work?",
            "What was the inspiration behind the diverse visual themes?\nI never played or even Heard of the original and when the midnight edition trailer popped on the Direct,me and my gf ( we both do art,my gf works profesionally -candela kerze ig-)thought the art and design looked great,but were kinda confused about the themes ,since we saw giant mechs,skeletons,werewolves,creatures,aliens,all sorts of stuff under these 80s goony like adventure lens.",
            "How long did the game take to develop? Also, how long is the game in length?\n\nLooks great, btw!",
            "What was the biggest development challenge your team faced, and how did you get around that?",
            "Since the game is set in the 90s and i'm a 90s kid i have to ask, what made you choose such a glorious decade?",
            "Thanks for putting out such a great game, happy to support Canadian devs! And the release timing with fathers day when one of the theme of the game is to find the main character's father fits so well. Can the raccoon be a party member? Also, were you inspired by Stranger Things? Would also love to know more about the storyboard process of the game if possible, who came up with the initial idea?",
            "What was the most difficult mechanic to program?",
            "Hey there, loving the art style of what I have seen so far\n\nMy question is, as a Switch player who also enjoys achievements but also the Switch I rely on devs having their Steam/Console achievements in-game in a menu some such.  Would I find the 50 achievements somewhere in this Switch port?\n\nFailing that, any thoughts towards adding them postlaunch through an update as others have done (Blasphemous, Dead Cells)?\n\nEither way, thanks for doing this AMA and best of luck with your release",
            "This looks freakin awesome! There's a nostalgia factor that I can't wait to enjoy! That giant worm battle instantly hooked me (immediately thought of FF7).  \n  \nYou mentioned that Echo Generation is is part of your voxel trilogy, so now I'm curious: what's next? Where do you plan to take Cococucumber?",
            "Any inspiration taken from the show \u201cAre you afraid of the dark\u201d?",
            "Art style looks great!",
            "Can the Raccoons be a party member?",
            "I love the music in the trailer, reminds me of Zombies ate my neighbors. I haven't played the 1st games, but am willing to because this looks fun. Is it a continuation of the story or same world kind of trilogy?",
            "Such a nostalgic feeling, looks great. Good luck to everyone and take care!",
            "This looks interesting,  will I be at a disadvantage for not having played the earlier game?",
            "Looks like a fun game! Congrats on the release. \n\nIf you could develop any Nintendo IP, which one would you choose? What kind of game would you make?",
            "Very cool looking game! I\u2019ve had nightmares of monster moose like that\u2026. What were your inspirations for the bosses/monsters?",
            "It looks so cool, definitely adding it to my wishlist! What was the most difficult part of the development?",
            "What is something cool about the game that was hard to fit into the trailer",
            "How often did you need to scrap ideas or rework them to fit within your core pillars or time constraints? For some games I've worked on in the past, me and my teams would usually need to rework a bunch of ideas even if we thought they would work well at first. I'm curious if this has happened in other games you guys have developed and how often you would spend reworking the ideas.",
            "Love the art style and animations!",
            "Mom, can we have Baldur's Gate 3 on Switch?\n\nBut you already have Baldur's Gate 3 at home!\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 at home: Echo Generation\n\n\nI really hope you don't mind, this was a pitiful joke, just take it as is.\n\nAs for a question: I almost always don't like to read about movies or games I would like to play, because I don't like spoilers. of course, I try to take some info to see if the game is something I would enjoy, sometimes this would be very hard to find out from a trailer, and you have to start digging into reviews or community, who may or may not spoil the game for you, but that's the risk you'll have to take. I tried doing this with your game, as I never heard of it before, and it was hard to find if I would like it or not. of course, I like RPG's, but you know what I mean. \nleaving that aside, I enjoyed the trailer, because it showed actual gameplay, and what the graphics would look like. and I found it to be very pleasing for the eyes, not everything has to be unreal 5 level [and imo very few devs should try to insist on making games look like real life graphics, but that personal bias]. \nwithout playing, I could not rate the gameplay or story, as I tend to find these the most important aspects of any game.\nreturning to graphics now, what would inspire a game developer to choose the aesthetic and color palette so it can deliver the final product? were you already set on something or reached it through trial and error?\n\n and secondly, can you name 3 games that are your favorites because of beautiful graphics [and you get to choose what beautiful means to you, be it realistic or artistic].\n\nthank you and sorry if it's hard to understand my English. good luck with your game!",
            "Don't have a question, just wanted to say I love the look of the game. Turned based games are also my preference so looking forward to try this out at some point.",
            "Most effective way to generate an echo?",
            "Looks super interesting, definitely need to add to my wishlist.",
            "Congrats!!",
            "How long did the game's development take?",
            "How long would you say the game",
            "Your game seems to have a sort of 80s nostalgia aesthetic. Did you draw inspiration from modern throwbacks to the era like It and Stranger Things or more so actual media from the era?",
            "Hey devs, just wanna say I loved your games and wishes you all a lot more years of success.",
            "Was there any particular reason you chose to set the game in the 90s besides the 90s being pure chaos?",
            "What inspired the name?",
            "this looks awesome, excited to see more! can you befriend the townsfolk? are there skill points / trees? i do love a skill point system",
            "Aw man, I missed the AMA. I loved seeing this trailer the other day and look forward to playing it.\n\nMy question is going to be the most important one someone could possibly ask\u2026 \n\nRain. Yes or no? And how much of it?",
            "How long did the game take to develop? Also, how long is the game in length?\n\nLooks great, btw!",
            "PS5 release?",
            "This game caught my eye! Thanks for doing the ama and giveaway",
            "Sounds really fun, how did you guys come up with this concept",
            "Bad at questions, but I love the look of your game.  It looks like you made something really unique!",
            "What is the best Canadian band and why is it Rush?",
            "This would have been such a sweet inclusion in the Indies Direct a few weeks ago!",
            "This looks like really cool game, as Q&A in IT I wonder. Have you guys playtested a lot? Where unit tests used a lot in the development ot maybe automation? \n\nSecond question: Are there partivular areas / battles you guys are most proud of?",
            "Looks good",
            "Vanessa: Great question! Since most of the team come from some sort of visual arts / creative background, this graphics has always been a priority for us. However, when building a scene, the initial starting point is more about what needs to happen at that location and how this fits into the story. Echo Generation is in essence a mystery, so we want to pace things out and reveal the story in a satisfying way and the elements that go into that - the graphics, music, dialog, enemy encounters, etc - all have to work together. A lot of the levels and characters have been through multiple iterations throughout development, and for Midnight Edition in particular, we chose to spend more time polishing the areas that are seen the most such as the main characters and the suburb area.",
            "Martin: Thanks, we appreciate your support! Actually, we are working on Ravenlok at the moment and should have more to share later this year\u2026",
            "Simone: There\u2019s a cat (Meowsy), dog (Doggo), robot (BLOPO-11), raccoon (Rex), and an alien jackalope (Noupy). Doggo\u2019s personality shares some similarities to Scooby Doo!",
            "Vicky: I love the entire raccoon population infesting the Suburb area. They\u2019re adorable and can\u2019t stop picking fights with people\n\nSimone: One of my favorites is the Prom Ghost. I love watching players/streamers getting jump-scared haha.\n\nLeona: I like the critters because some of them hide in random areas, and it\u2019s funny how the baby critter calls for backup!\n\nEdgar: The mutated aliens. Their designs are really cool and they were fun to animate!",
            "Vanessa: Glad that you like the blocky look! We\u2019ve been developing a trilogy of games in this 3D pixel art style which we call the \u2018Voxel Trilogy\u2019 and it includes Riverbond, Echo Generation, and Ravenlok. There is something charming, retro and so nostalgic about using pixels / voxels, and in a game like Echo Generation, it really makes a lot of sense. In fact, all three games have this tone in common so you should check them out if you\u2019re interested in seeing the evolution of our voxel art style.",
            "Vanessa: Wouldn\u2019t that be great? We\u2019d love to release a physical for Echo Generation: Midnight Edition once we have fixed all the bugs and ported to all digital platforms.",
            "Vicky: Basically, it\u2019s a combination of turn-based combat with minigames associated with each skill. When you succeed in a mini game, you will do bonus damage and apply various status effects depending on the skill. There are comic books around the world you can collect in order to gain more powerful moves.",
            "Martin: The idea was to create a big mashup and pay homage to different films, TV shows, books, and video games such as The X-Files, Metal Gear Solid, Tremors, Pet Sematary, Fright Night, and LucasArts adventure games. Some locations, like the suburb, ditch trail, abandoned house, repair shop, cornfield, downtown, and high school are also inspired by real places from my childhood.",
            "Martin: Thanks! Echo Generation can take between 8 to 10 hours to complete. We started prototyping in the summer of 2018, and production began in early 2020. In total, it took about 2 years of full-time development for the core team, including the Midnight Edition.",
            "Martin: In terms of coding, one of the biggest challenges was to make everything using voxels as it\u2019s not a usual way to create games. We had to create our own custom tools and art pipeline to make it work. When it came to optimizing for the Switch, the hardware limitation was another added challenge. Voxels in particular aren't well suited for the optimization needed for Switch, so we had to problem solve around that while keeping the charm of voxels.",
            "Martin: Ah the 90s, such a great decade with just the \\*right\\* amount of technology. We love the games from that time like the LucasArts adventure games and Final Fantasy VII. I remember when the first 3D console came out and it was revolutionary. All this makes for a very vibrant and fun decade that matches the tone and visuals for what we had in mind for Echo Generation.",
            "Vanessa: Thank you! We love to hear from our Canadian fans, especially for Echo Generation :) The father\u2019s day launch timing was actually a good coincidence but we definitely leaned into that for the launch trailer once we locked on the release date for Midnight Edition.\u00a0\n\nCan the raccoon be a party member? - Yes\n\nAlso, were you inspired by Stranger Things? - Also yes\n\nAs for the initial idea, the story for Echo Generation came from Martin (Game Director) who introduced the team to all these really cool and obscure 80s and 90s references and said \"let's make a game about this.\u201d Some of the location, scenes and dialog were also inspired by Martin\u2019s childhood, which you'll have to ask him about!",
            "Justin: For me, the most difficult mechanic to code was the minigame attack system. Each minigame has its own unique mechanic and visual differences, so with over 30 minigames, the sheer quantity alone made it quite a challenge.",
            "Martin: There\u2019s currently no internal custom achievements on the Switch version for Midnight Edition, but it's a great suggestion! Perhaps it's something we could consider in the future.",
            "Vanessa: That is a good question. One thing we would love to do is to expand the story and rich world of Echo Generation in a sequel or prequel. Some other possible areas to explore include switching up some of the gameplay and maybe even the art style (though we\u2019ve come to realize that after completing a self-styled voxel trilogy, some fans may want more voxels!) Either way, we\u2019re excited to share what\u2019s next when ready.",
            "Vicky: Not intentionally! A lot of our inspirations came from the same time period and genre, and it's Canadian to boot, so I definitely see how they relate. The Goonies is one of our narrative inspirations alongside other 80s / 90s kids movies; we wanted to invoke the way they touched on scary and sometimes bizarre stories and myths in combination with comedy and adventure.",
            "Vicky: Rex the Raccoon will happily join your party, but he\u2019s in a bit of a bind and you\u2019ll have to help him out of his predicament first though\u2026",
            "Zombies Ate My Neighbors was such a gem! But scary as hell and impossible to beat!\n\nThis game looks fun too, but in more of an Earthbound way.",
            "Vanessa: Thanks! Echo Generation is a standalone and you don\u2019t need to have played the other games in our voxel trilogy to get into this one; the connection between the three games is through the art style.",
            "Simone: You definitely don\u2019t need to have played the earlier release to enjoy playing the Midnight Edition! The general story and gameplay is very similar but with added fixes, improvements and quality of life features. It\u2019s great for new players and those who have played previously.",
            "Vanessa: Thank you! Since Tears of the Kingdom is one of my most played games on Switch, I would love to work on the Zelda IP. Not even to make a new game, just to work with the TotK devs be like \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d\n\nJustin: If I had the chance to work on any Nintendo IP I would pick the Legend of Zelda series. Ocarina of Time and Wind Waker were my first impressions of Nintendo and was what made me a fan of their games till this day! As for the type of game I would like to work on, I would like to make something more aligned with their older Zelda games.\n\nEdgar: I would love to work on Zelda. Wind Waker and Twilight Princess were some of my favorite games growing up.\n\nLeona: I would choose Xenoblade Chronicles because I enjoy playing JRPGs and it was one of the games I played the most on the Wii.",
            "Simone: The monster moose/Wendageddon was inspired by Wendigo folklore, werewolves and of course, the Canadian moose. Prom Ghost was inspired by ghosts from Japanese horror like The Ring. The Worm Boss was inspired by Tremors and the Crittants were based on Gremlins.",
            "Thanks for the question! Answered in another reply: [https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1dl65pi/comment/l9nj4t1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1dl65pi/comment/l9nj4t1/)",
            "Vanessa: Since Echo Generation has a lot going on story-wise, it\u2019s challenging to choose what to highlight in the trailer. It\u2019s a balance of trying to spark curiosity but at the same time not give too much away. Also, text dialog in a trailer format is harder to work with since it tends to slow down the pacing - which is tough because we want it to be high energy and exciting, especially for a launch trailer. That said, we found that some things like trying to get the humor of the game works well when we do a sequence like the ghost cat lady asking \u201cAre you here to mourn for your pet?\u201d followed by a combat shot of Doggo piling dirt on her.",
            "Vanessa: Great question. There\u2019s actually a pretty big area close to the end of the game that did not make it into the final game because of time constraints so it definitely happens to us too! As for reworking sections of the game, there\u2019s constant iterations happening throughout production but especially at the polish stage since everything is mapped out by then and we can dedicate time towards the areas that have the most impact.",
            "Thank you!",
            "Vicky: To answer the last part of your question, Red Dead Redemption 2 for the art direction - the realistic graphic is very carefully curated to create an emotional feeling for the North American wilderness. I\u2019m very impressed by the nuance they managed to pull off in that. Disco Elysium for the smudgy, almost ethereal painterly graphic that's also incredibly detailed in places. It's very surreal and fits perfectly with the story. And finally, Journey for its minimalistic and yet impressive composition.",
            "Vicky: There are a lot of different kinds of considerations for choosing an aesthetic and color palette and a part of it is ensuring that the art style enhances the theme of the game. In the case of Echo Generation, the voxel style evokes a similar kind of charm and nostalgia that the 80s / 90s theme echoes.\u00a0\n\nThe decision process is a combination of the initial idea and lots of trial and error. Most artistic processes go through a lot of iterations, and through that process many decisions are made that can sometimes change the initial vision quite drastically!",
            "Thanks for the kind words! We hope you have a chance to play it.",
            "Amazing! Wishing you all nothing but success",

The exploration, the puzzles, it was all so\u2026 perfect. The visuals scratched that itch in my art-loving brain, the gameplay was fun, engaging, and sometimes difficult, and the character interactions were lively, and energetic (don\u2019t mind the fact that they moan when they speak to you). I put off the ending for TWO YEARS and finally got to it, and\u2026 I was so disappointed. Everything up until then had been amazing. But the true \u201cfinal boss\u201d was just shoot a couple arrows with an otherwise unobtainable bow.

Once I started adapting that playstyle  (over 2 decades ago) I now play 90% of my gaming like that. \n\nBut in my case I don't think it's about anxiety.  I play games for the mechanics and gameplay. Not the story or the cutscenes. And I don't care about the \"sense of accomplishment\".\n\nSo I just say \"eh.  I played the whole game except this last fight?  I guess I experienced EVERYTHING (gameplay and mechanism), huh?... Alright cool. I don't need to strain my way through this part. I'm done\"\n\nThe exceptions are notable because the game itself is conducive to unique gameplay. Like Shadow of the Collosus.  Or the end boss is so fucking unique (in terms of the rest of the game) that I need to experience it, like Lavos (Chrono trigger) or Metal Gear (MGS).  Or I'm just having so much fun playing the game I didn't notice it ended until the credits rolled (the new Tomb Raider games)\n\nIt's a weird playstyle habit of mine.  But I'm OK w it.

That will be easier to finish than the 40+ hour RPG, I just need to de-rust and readjust to the game feel, but I still feel so dumb for doing that.",

I call it \"Ni no Kuni-ing it,\" because Ni no Kuni 1 was the first game I did it to that I remember it enough to be noteworthy.\n\n> I think it\u2019s a combo of not wanting it to end and anxiety about the final fight.\n\nThis would definitely be a good explanation for me, especially for the example above. That game was awesome. The final dungeon was also brutal, so I probably had some anxiety about the final fight caused by it.",

And if I ever decide to go back to ACNH, I\u2019ll have to start all over again because it\u2019s been too long. \ud83d\ude05",
            "I think this is the first time I have consciously stopped playing a game because I love it so much. I also haven\u2019t usually gone into a game knowing its length. But I heard Tavern Talk is a shorter one so, yes, I want to manage my gameplay and spread out the dopamine. \ud83d\ude0a",

            "I love that. I need to check out Mario Wonder!",

            "That\u2019s the game that got me into this state! I accidentally finished it without realizing it in just one short sitting. I was so distraught. I would have done more side quests and exploration first. I will go back to it!",

            "I get this feeling like I don\u2019t ever want to be in a position that I couldn\u2019t go play TOTK if I want to.  Kind of trying to avoid the inevitable hole that beating breath of the wild gave me lol",
            "P5R doesn't really end for me. You can replay it with different choice (which, yes, don't change anything overall but still make the game feel differently). And if you need a new one play P4G. It's about the same, just in a rural setting but equally great.",

            "I\u2019ve gotten to the end of several Final Fantasy games and have never finished a single one for the same reason. And I think it\u2019s partially that my interest in playing a game can only last so long and big RPGs take a long time and often have some ridiculously hard or time consuming side quests at the end, but I like to 100% games, so my will runs out before I\u2019m done.",
            "That\u2019s so funny. Same with me. Same game. I got burned out and never finished it so I watched the final battle and ending on YouTube.",
            "I got to the end boss of FFX and went back played through the entire thing all over again before finishing it back in the day. Some games are so impactful you don\u2019t mind experiencing them twice over the first time around",
            "Playing the same game right now and have the same feelings. I didn\u2019t know this was a \u201cthing\u201d for people other than me tbh. \ud83d\ude02",
            "I feel like early RPGs taught us final boss fights are horrendous.",
            "Same here! And I\u2019m a die hard Metroid fan!",

            "I done the demo for Spiritfarer and loved it. It recently went on sale so I purchased it, briefly played it the other day but have since abandoned it for Cult of the Lamb",
            "My subjective opinion is that it's worth playing both, in the released order BOTW -> TOTK. There's really no story spoilers to worry about because that's not really the focus of the games. But you only get one \"first exploration\" of the surface world and I really enjoyed the zen, natural feeling of BOTW. The climbing. The strategic gliding. Seeing wild horses and sneaking up to catch them. Crossing bodies of water strategically. The traversal is really enjoyable in BOTW. Challenging enough to be engaging but peaceful enough to be relaxing.\n\nTOTK exploration is enjoyable too but it's a different feeling. I did a lot more vehicle building and sky island diving. \n\nMy recommendation is explore BOTW, then play TOTK and focus on sky islands and depth exploration.\n\nCan't really go wrong though. Both games are phenomenal. BOTW is my favorite game of all time.",
            "Both are phenomenal games but the first playthrough of BotW is just magic",
            "Same here, I haven't played it in months and now I'm like a noob",
            "I stopped  playing after the great sky island tutorial and a bit of roaming. I felt so overwhelmed for some reason...like I knew this was going to be a 1000+ hours game. I should probably give it another try soon :P \n\nNever had that problem with botw...",
            "I did this but got really far, just have the spirit temple left to do. The problem is I never want to go back and do a temple so I usually just end up wandering around hoping to find the shrines I missed but there's so few left I end up turning it off lmao.",
            "I haven\u2019t in like 3 weeks I better get on it",
            "Never have I felt more visible. Wanted to drag it out, then spent too long away and now have no idea how to play the game",
            "I loved Tears of the Kingdom. I loved it even more playing through again after a year.\n\nThe second time around it felt a lot less overwhelming knowing what to expect. I rode my horse from stable to stable just helping Penn, escorting Koroks, helping Addison, exploring caves and anything interesting.",
            "Samesies for both. I was really expecting a DLC so I could jump back into the game when it was released. Then it wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s summer break for me, once I get my sad, dead, release day switch back from Nintendo, TOTK is what I\u2019m going to do!",
            "Did this with TOTK yeah. Played it almost day after work for at least a little bit. Loved it so much. Got all the shrines, all the lightroots, did almost all quests. Felt like it was just time, but legit missed the game after it was done. Hell I still do sometimes, but don\u2019t know if I want to invest all that time again for Round 2. It\u2019ll never be the same as Round 1.",
            "Nah just go back to grinding!",
            "Same exact problem, won't even try BOTW because I know I'll get sucked in.",

            "My brother did this to me growing up with Super Mario 64\u2026so many stars\u2026poofed",
            "Nooooo! I think it\u2019s time to revisit game. I never played it on GameCube. It\u2019s been so fun!",
            "Extremely well. The loading times used to be crazy but a recent-ish patch sped them up to like 3-4 seconds instead of 20+",
            "It has to be the only reason or else why would we never finish games we loved? Interesting to think about. I really need to finish some of these games because I still think about them to this day lol.",
            "I am a bit uncertan about the term but I certantly do like anthropomothic animal characters.",
            "My favorite Videogame is \"Fuga Melodies of Steel\".\n\nIts a 20 houer long turn based JRPG about a groupe of anthropomothic animal children that go on a quest to save there families. They live inside a giant ancient mysterious powerful fortress like Tank. Its a bit like Howls Moving castle but based on technology instead of magic.\n\nIf you are interested in trying it out: It has a free demo which is just straight up the first 3 chapters of the game.",
            "I personaly enjoy replaying games becuse on subsequent playthroughs I know better how to play the game well and sometimes characters grow on me more and more over time.",

They live inside a giant ancient mysterious powerful fortress like Tank. Its a bit like Howls Moving castle but based on technology instead of magic. \n\nShould someone be interested in trying Fuga out: \n\nIts available on PC and most modern consoles like Switch, PS4, PS5 and so on.\n\nFuga has a free demo which is just straight up the first 3 chapters of the game. I highly recommend that demo.\n\nIt has a direct sequel: \"Fuga Melodies of Steel 2\" which released in May 2023. I played through that ine 8 times so far. But I advice against playing the second game before the first game unless you do not care about the story and characters.",
            "The game is excellent. I swear the name is why it wasn\u2019t an instant hit.",
            "Physical copy has been on sale lately if you get lucky. I just got it. I love the style. I wanted physical cos my card is getting full and I figured it was a big game.",
            "I have two playthrough's that are basically at the beginning of act 3 and one with the aforementioned maybe halfway.\n\nDame Aylin's reveal hits so hard every time lol.",
            "Different motivation but same outcome: played Metroid prime remastered a few weeks ago. I died 2 frames before the Endboss went down. Did not go for it again because the was a jumping passage with respawning enemies.\n\nIt was not hard but annoying AF. Could not bring myself to do it again.",
            "I thought Animal Crossing was a really easy game to get back to.",
            "Oh yeah especially when I know it'll be a short game, I really restrict how much I play daily!",
            "Yes this is a great one! I finished it after about 3 days but towards the end I didn\u2019t want it to end yet so I had to slow myself down. \n\nAlso check out Superliminal if you haven\u2019t already.",
            "I\u2019ve kinda learned to live with it - if it brings me joy in the moment and I start losing it, that\u2019s ok; there are always more games to play. And if I come back to it and it\u2019s been a long time\u2026.oh no guess I have to start over again \ud83d\ude43 there are a couple games I\u2019ve played the first like half multiple times because I keep stopping before the end \ud83d\ude06",
            "cant possibly enter the final bossfight without a full inventory. ganondorf will understand",
            "Yes. I did beat all of these games, some several times (Currently running through SMT5V) and they still hit just as hard. Chrono Trigger I've done almost 5 times.",
            "My thought was, \u201cYeah, my old ass hands just can\u2019t do stuff like that anymore. I\u2019ll pass.\u201d And I loved the game and am I die-hard fan of the series. But I noped out on that.",

            "I love FF, played since SNES days. That said 15 was the first one I actually beat lol",
            "Same, I think? I don't remember doing it when I was younger, but it started, to my recollection, 25ish years ago with Final Fantasy 7.",
            "Oh I love Spiritfarer but could not get into Cult of the Lamb. I have to go back and try it again.",
            "If you could only buy one?",
            "Same",
            "I did the final boss on TotK after not playing at all for months and basically forgot all the controls. However, it turn out 300+ hours of gameplay gets you really OP and I managed to beat the boss first.",
            "Feel just like you. It is such an open space that it is overwhelming and I get distracted a lot when trying to reach a place on the map. I just started again on the same save file, but I can only go for some minutes before I leave it, as I can't remember where I'm at. I'm thinking of starting all over.",
            "Same sort of. I got like 75% of the way through and got distracted. I think by baldurs gate, which I played through half of act 2 and got distracted. Seems like a pattern.\n\nI only just recently finished Elden Ring since the DLC was coming out. Started NG+, so who knows when I\u2019ll actually get to play the dlc. I\u2019ve been distracted by slay the spire",
            "Unless you're exploring literally everything... its like 40-60 hours lol",
            "I finished the game and did all of the shrines, I still turn it on to wander around the world, I find it really peaceful. \n\nSometimes I find caves I never noticed before, or random NPC interactions I missed. This and just swinging around in Spider-Man 2 are my favorite things to play when I just want to wind down for the day",
            "Right? Sometimes you just know and have to make the responsible decision.",
            "That's so strange to me.. you won't play something because you'll enjoy it too much... So you play games that aren't as good?",
            "OMG please tell me why I bought BOTW at the end of the Wii U's life and then never played it. And then I got it again on my Switch when the Switch released, then never played that version either. And I played EVERY Zelda growing up and beat them all, but I have never played BOTW despite owning it twice on two different consoles!",
            "These situations qualify as video game crimes against humanity",
            "Star Fox 64. I had spent so much time on that game and was one medal away from unlocking the jetpack mode on multiplayer. Countless hours practicing to get perfect runs. I was SO close to getting the score I needed for that last medal. \n\nMy little sister was playing and wanted to know the date for some weird reason. So she clocked on \"Date\". The game asked her, \"Do you really want to know the date?\" And she said yes.\n\nData. That menu item was Data.",
            "Yes you are right - Now that the Switch version is out, its definitely time to actually finish TTYD this time around! No best friend's little brothers to ruin things for me",
            "Absolutely! Time to revisit our friends\u2026 and enemies!",
            "I love that! You\u2019ve sold me on replaying games! Thanks!",
            "Oh wow, I've never even heard of this before, but it sounds right up my alley. Definitely downloading this demo now. \n\nThanks for sharing!",
            "You do different play throughs at the same time? Thats cool!",
            "Ahhhh!! I hate that. It\u2019s just as bad as a too-easy final boss battle. I need to work for it, but also don\u2019t make it impossible.",
            "It should be, but I have a terrible memory and just felt so discombobulated.",
            "I have accidentally played a game in one go and felt so distraught when I didn\u2019t see it coming to an end. So I want to be careful with this one bc it\u2019s so cute and comforting.",
            "Thanks for the rec! I will check that out too!",
            "I\u2019ve never replayed a game with a storyline but someone else mentioned they do the same and it low key blew my mind. I had the feeling like \u201cwell I already know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d but I reread books and rewatch TV. I\u2019m going to replay some games!",
            "I played Cult of the Lamb for hours for a few days, then I just stopped lol. I really enjoy it though and will revisit it soon. But I have just started Disney dreamlight valley which I purchased on sale",
            "I loved spiritfarer and now love cult of the lamb. They aren't alike, but give it another go!",
            "If you could buy only one, I would personally recommend BOTW. You can't really go wrong though, if you already bought TOTK you will love that too. Others might even recommend TOTK over BOTW. \n\nYou asked for subjective opinions though, my personal experience was that BOTW is like a 9.9/10 and TOTK is like a 9.6/10. Both incredible games. Wish I could forget I played them and play them again haha",
            "I haven\u2019t played either and got a Switch for Xmas last year.  My friend keeps egging me on to get one of them but I can never remember which one is recommended to get.  From what I remember him telling me they are basically the same game",
            "Exactly the same",
            "I'd say that I decided to finish it (main quest) just to stop (or most probably pause) playing it. But as many said, 70% that I'll launch a new save instead of continuing, just to accommodate when coming back.",
            "Ah good point and allow to add my reasoning. While I love gaming, I want to spend my time doing so many things. For myself, I know a game like this is tough to put down. I now tend to focus on games I can learn in a few hours of playing, then can pick up and play for 20-30 minutes without having to remember/keep track of much in terms of progressing through the game. Maybe one day the timing will feel right for BOTW.",
            "ADHD moment",
            "I mean, only you can tell us why you did that... Why not just play it",
            "Damn kids! I hope you have fun!!!",
            "Can you tell me your first impresion after you cleared chapter 1? \n\nThose first impresions can be fun.",
            "For RPG's I often do multi playthrough's at once. I'm impatient and like to see all aspects of choices in the moment and paths that result. I'm also a completionist. BG3 is a bit of a nightmare for someone like that lol.",
            "The boss was not the problem. It was that freaking jumping passage with respawning Metroids. I like to work for a boss to a certain degree.",
            "The exact same thing happened to me, I got a game before spring break once and was really excited to play it but then I cleared the whole thing halfway through break because I played nonstop and I couldn't afford a other game for at least another month or so and it traumatized me",
            "Cult of the Lamb had me hard focused on building up the actual cult in the beginning\u2026didn\u2019t start digging into the dungeons until my cult was basically completed",
            "I saw that you went back to Spiritfarer after a long break and you motivated me to do that same. And I will give Cult of the Lambs another go. Thanks! \u263a\ufe0f",
            "Thank you",
            "They're both great, but I liked TOTK more and definitely got more hooked on it. \n\nBut if you play TOTK first, I could see it being difficult to fully enjoy BOTW if you want to play it after.\n\nSo I'd recommend BOTW first and then TOTK if you can.",
            "People say both I only have totk but I heard they both good",
            "Obviously, only I know why I make my own decisions. Thanks.",
            "I will definitely update this comment once I've cleared it. Not sure I'll be able to get to it tonight, but it's definitely next on my queue.",
            "Yes! Exactly.",
            "Yeah it can be easy to do that, it's all about balance!",
            "Have fun crying for spiritfarer! \ud83d\ude05 My favourite game that makes me ugly cry haha. They are both great games. I am not far in cult of the lamb but I am enjoying it.",
            "Yeah. I cried after playing A Short Hike. I know Spiritfarer is going to have me in my big feels at the end. (Which is probably why I\u2019m avoiding it.)"

            "I haven\u2019t played a Mario & Luigi game since partners in time. I\u2019m exited to play a new one. I\u2019m sure I missed a lot in between then and now though.",
            "A lot of them really:\n\n**Mario & Luigi: Brothership:** Mario RPGs are back in full force and I can't be more happy. I have been waiting more than a decade (Because Paper Jam sucked) for a truly new Mario & Luigi.\n\n**The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom:** 2D Zelda finally comes back eleven years after ALBW with a twist that makes it as creative as TOTK is. Can't wait to try it out and see how I solve some of those puzzles in the most absurd ways.\n\n- **Dragon Quest III: HD-2D Remake:** It's... it's beautiful. Also more information that has came out hinted at new story beats, new classes and even physical skills being added. And then they drop the bombshell of 1 and 2 also getting remade. Day 1 Purchase.\n\n**Super Mario Party Jamboree:** Finally a game that feels like a true sequel to MP1-8. Super Mario Party was so underwhelming while Superstars had amazing gameplay but lacked in new content. This has both and I can't wait to make new frenemies that want to punch me thanks to this game.\n\n**Ace Attorney Investigations Collection:** Beyond hyped to finally get AAI2 localized, because that game is such a masterpiece and the new HD sprites look so amazing and smooth. This got my biggest scream out of the Direct.\n\n**Donkey Kong Country Returns HD:** It feels dissapointing to get yet another release of this game instead of a new DK... but then I realized that for Returns we have either a jaggy SD version with wiimote waggle to roll at 60 fps, or a portable version that looks way worse at 30 fps but uses buttons and has new levels. Now we have the best of both worlds, the Definitive version. Excited to replay Returns more often now thanks to this.\n\n**Metroid Prime 4 Beyond:** After 7 years of waiting... it's finally here. The hypest part of the trailer was that forest area shown at the very end. I'm so eager to explore it. Maybe I should replay 2 and 3 before it comes out (Welp, it's time to dust off the Trilogy disc and get AA Batteries for the Wiimote).\n\nAlso I'm not really a Fighting game fan but the **Marvel vs Capcom games** (Especially MvC2) getting re-released is such a huge deal, no one thought I'd ever happen again.\n\nWhat a banger of a Direct.

[Their last attempt was Vicarious Visions, but Activision cancelled the project and then put that team to work on Call of Duty.](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/05/details-emerge-of-a-cancelled-donkey-kong-project-from-vicarious-visions)",

            "People swear by the original mainly for the original soundtrack and artstyle, as well as the remake having some performance issues at moments and 30 fps. The original is my favorite DS game of all time, but I also think the remake is alright overall. I also like both the original/DS artstyle and the newer/3DS artstyle, but opinions on the artstyle are very dependent on the person. It's really not terrible, but it does have some rough issues.",
            "Imo (as someone who actually rlly likes the Superstar Saga remake), the BiS remake artstyle looks a lot worse, it takes so much longer to get into a battle, and the frame rate is 30fps compared to the original\u2019s 60fps, and you can rlly feel it. At its core it\u2019s still a good game just bc the original is, but I see no reason to play it over the original and no reason it should\u2019ve been remade to begin with.",
            "It's worthless. The 3DS could already play Bowser's Inside Story and it didn't need any fixing like Partners in Time needed with a remake that it never got because of this damn thing.\n\nThe added content is awful, just like it was back in the Superstar Saga remake (but at least that one could justify its own existence), they made the game more ugly with the \"updated\" artstyle for no reason other than cha-ching (which didn't even work, the game flopped. Hard. So hard it's considered one of the biggest failures in the entire Mario franchise and killed the studio behind it.)",

Metroid and Donkey Kong excluding each other has been a thing since the birth of both franchises.\n\n**1981-1983:** Donkey Kong Arcade trilogy gets made and catapults Nintendo into making videogames. Metroid doesn't exist yet.\n\n**1986-1994:** 2D Metroid trilogy gets made and ends in March 1994 with the masterpiece called Super Metroid. Donkey Kong has become non-existent and totally overshadowed by Mario.\n\n**1994-2002:** Donkey Kong under Rare gets into its Golden Age with the Country Trilogy, the Land games, Diddy Kong Racing and DK64, it becomes one of the biggest IPs ever, on par with Mario. Meanwhile, Metroid is in hiatus and skips the whole generation.\n\n**2002-2010:** After Rare gets bought by Microsoft. Donkey Kong Racing, Diddy Kong Pilot and more games get cancelled and in the following years, it only gets ports of Rare's games and some spin offs of dubious quality. Meanwhile, Metroid enters its Golden Age with the Prime Trilogy, 2D gets Fusion and Zero Mission, also spin offs like Prime Hunters (The online community was big back then) and even a great Pinball game.\n\n**2010-2017:** Metroid Other M happens, then Metroid enters a second hiatus and gets nothing for years (Federation Force was basically what DK was getting the whole past decade). At the same time Retro moves on to make DKC Returns  and Tropical Freeze. The latter might be the best game in the series and the best 2D platformer I've played (On par with DKC2).\n\n**2017-Now:** Metroid Prime 4 gets announced and it's finally up to release next year, Samus Returns gets announced the same day, Metroid Dread in 2021, which continues the canon after 19 years. DK is.... missing in action again.... at least we got ports of Returns and Tropical Freeze.... yay.\n\nI shall call this the Metroid Kong curse.",
            "Retro is phenomenal. They really knock it out of the park every time.\n\n\nI'd love to see them handle an original IP backed by the same TLC Nintendo gives to their first party titles like they do with MP and DKC.",

            "Nah\n\nIt was better and more creative overall I find it\n\nBut I know my opinion is unpopular lol\n\nBut you will never be able to conveice me that BiS is better.\n\nThe writting were about equal I would say, it's not better nor worse in DT."
