Is that overblown? Well, we catch plenty in some Reddit filters, but we aren't seeing many reports from users on this stuff.\n\nWe do casually browse the sub but if you report rule breaking posts and comments, it's a lot faster than waiting for us to stumble upon it.\n\n* Post links to images, memes, and gifs that **make wrestling fun.** -- that was literally the whole reason the sub was created.\n* Don't be an asshole. Taunting and belittling other wrestling fans is not **making wrestling fun**.\n\nY'all produce some absolute banger memes most of the time and I can not tell you how much I appreciate a great shitpost. We can be that sub 100% of the time if the community helps by letting us know that we've got someone trying to ruin the party before they've already punched 5 holes in the wall.\n\nAppreciate everyone's support on this.

The matches have been good but storyline wise, the top baby face on Raw was Jey Uso lol, and as much as i appreciate Jey he\u2019s no Seth in terms of credibility and star power. The biggest indicator of this is, currently on the Raw roster it feels like an inevitability that Gunther will win the WHC at Summerslam whether it\u2019s against DP, or whether someone else won it along the way like a Jey or maybe even Drew. It\u2019s only really Seth who has the credibility to beat Gunther, clean, 1 on 1. \n\nThe main title scene, while the matches have been fantastic, have kind of been angles that lack heat due to it being Heel vs Heel or just not having the proper build but Seth is always incredible at convincing you he deserves to be there and it\u2019s always possible he wins.",

It was good too as Punk's title win was inevitable and Punk had gone up against similar barbs when he faced Eddie Kingston. \n\nPunk took umbrage with it however as ~~1. He wasn't present in the building during the aforementioned promo~~, 2. He hadn't personally cleared it and 3. Convinced himself that Hangman was going to work uber stiff and hurt him.\n\nEverything could have been easily sorted out by sitting down and taking to each other.\n\n*Edit* As mentioned by someone below, he did the promo to Punks face, it was Punk who responded eventually by doing a promo without Page in the building.",

It's more like the bully in the class getting the confidence to be a nuisance repeatedly cause the teacher turned a blind eye. Then the unbothered kid one day decides he has enough, takes that bully down with a single punch, and the principal comes in,  and does a Pikachu, suspending the one that actually stood up for what's right.\n\nTony should've known better after the whole locker room brawl incident.",

There was no need at all for it, and it wasn't entertaining or something any fans wanted. The difference between the kind of shoots Punk did, and what Hangman did, is huge. A shoot promo done well serves the fans desire to hear that reality spill out, and engage people in the product, this wasn't of any value to anyone. Punk's Pipe Bomb elevated WWE and re-engaged lapsed fans. Hangman shot a hole in AEW's own hull.\n\nPunk was taking AEW to a new level and helping people. He wasn't ruining anything. He was fucking helping. He helped Darby, Ricky Starks, FTR, Joe and MJF, he took their best stars even higher. He was doing his job perfectly. \n\nThe Bucks and Hangman haven't been in a professional environment for a long time and it started to show last year.",

He asked them to mend ways, they didn't...yet continue to milk the topic every now and then...if Tony passively agrees with that...then 1) he's immature, 2) he's bitter abt losing Punk, 3) he's convinced AEWians would appreciate. \n\nAll of those could be true but imo what he fails to realise, by doing so, his vast company is being fragmented...those that want to pander to the crowd, those who don't, those without spotlight, those in only for the money....all of these people in it for their own interest. Fine, every company has those, but, in every company the staff knows that I must not piss off the boss, and stay in line.
