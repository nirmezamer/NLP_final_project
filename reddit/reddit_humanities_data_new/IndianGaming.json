            "I'm thinking of buying a gaming PC and wanted to know any PCs I can get at a rate of something close to 70-80k, yes, like all people I decided to go with a system I would construct myself but that would prove too much of a fuss for me and the prices for all the specs of the PC on Elitehubs is pretty much the same. I am not so stingy with my money so if it is worth it I can go a bit beyond the budget. My current system's score on UserBenchmark is an 11% in gaming and 11% in workstation making it an effective Tree Trunk in their classification system. I am seeing a lot of combos in pre-built and some PC ideas I came up with on PC building sites of using the following build. I will change a few things in the pre build such as adding a 2 TB SSD and something like 32 GB of RAM so I have no problems in the future, and I have gotten a 12 GB VRAM GPU to go forward in it. This system seems to be something that can handle 4k 60 FPS gaming but I'll stick to 1440p for the higher FPS. I'm buying the PC from Elite Hub since they seem to be pretty trusted among the community and have some solid deals. In my opinion if I add a 2 TB SDD, 2 more sticks of RAM, it should prove to be a good build for my use. Also please let me know whether windows and drivers are pre-installed or I am going to have to purchase and install them as required.\n\nI used some other components since I couldn't find what was in the system on UserBench however it should be pretty much the same.\n\nhttps://elitehubs.com/collections/prebuilt-gaming-pc/products/eternalx-e510-intel-core-i5-14500-nvidia-rtx-3050-8-gb-16gb-ram-500gb-m-2-nvme-gen4-ssd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4sizfnbml8zc1.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=241977ea2848b48b9333cd6bf302731df8f47bea",

            "TLDR Version First- I have TCL 55t6g/c645 tv which supports HDMI v2.1, currently I'm using a dirt cheap HDMI cable(it was INR200 ig, don't know the HDMI version) which I found lying at my home no one was using. I was facing ghosting and bandwith issues with my tv when playing games and sometimes the tv would blankout for a second when turning on/off ceiling fan. Went to Google and found out using high quality HDMI cable would solve the issue, should I buy one??\n\nNOW The Long Version With Details -\n\nI bought the TCL 55T6G/C645 TV in winters for gaming purpose, I also own a monitor which supports 1080p@165hz using dp1.2, I didn't had enough budget to buy a new cable and also at the same moment found an old cable lying around collecting dust so I decided to plug it in, don't even know the HDMI version. From the start I was facing problems while gaming, using the 2k 120z hz mode on my tv I was facing ghosting issues, I thought it was my tv so went to reddit for a solution, turns out it's really a problem but very few people have it, the solution I found was to turn of vrr and the ghosting was reduced but stil noticed. I gave up and used the normal 60hz mode on 2k(my gpu is weak so I can't game on 4k). Now, here comes summer and I have to use ceiling fan, turns out I have a new problem where turning on/off fan blankouts the tv for a few seconds. Went to Google again and found using high quality cable would solve the issue, and while researching this topic I found out a blog explaining cheap vs expensive HDMI cables that it doesn't matter and only the HDMI version matters. Like a dirt cheap HDMI 2.1 would work as good as an expensive HDMI 2.1, the only difference would be life and not picture quality.\n\nThe thing now is I'm in confusion wether the cable I'm using is good or not, it doesn't even support vrr or allm, ig that's why I was facing ghosting issues earlier, I mean i saw on Google that if a cable can't do a resolution or hz it would not show that resolution on windows, but the thing is this is a tv and I don't think like windows we can set a specific hz, like it automatically switches to 120hz whether the cable supports it or not, I'm saying this because I once tried a HDMI 1.4 which can only go upto 1080p@120hz but the tv was still showing 2k 120hz and 4k 60hz, even if the cable can't do that.\n\nThe cable which I'm using now is exobyte awm style 20276 80\u00b0c 30v, i don't have the packaging, I'm typing what is written on the cable. Should I buy a new HDMI 2.1 cable, like would that solve my problems?? Pls guide someone and also link some good and budget friendly 2.1 hdmi cables.\n\nI REQUEST ALL TO READ BOTH TLDR AND LONG VERSION.",

            "Looking to buy a Legion Slim 5 ( Ryzen 8845HS ) with 4060. And I was looking into warranty. Generally people seems to have good opinion about their warranty service. So here are my questions and doubts. I know there are other alternatives at same price point but I checked and they basically have 1080p display, NTSC 45%, or Low brightness. ASUS's warranty is a scam. And Intel variants have poor thermals.\n\n\\* I do need battery life even though 70% of the time I'll be plugged in \\*\n\n* Checked the price and I could get a \\*\\*Legion Slim 5 with maxed out RAM\\*\\* or \\*\\*Legion 5 Pro ( 7745HX ) at basically same price with half RAM\\*\\*, Is it better? Or is the HX model as power hungry as i7 14th Gen?\n* What does the MUX & Advanced Optimus here actually mean? Like If I use iGPU only, will it turn off Nvidia completely? I have an Acer laptop with an MX150 and it shuts down the dGPU completely but same generation 1050Ti laptops still had dGPUs running in idle at lower power state.\n* About warranty on Lenovo, It says 1 year warranty and the choice in upgrading warranty seems expensive but at \\*Buyalenovo\\* shows that I could get warranty at 2999/- ( 2yr standard + 3 yr accidental ). Does that mean it'll stack up and become 3 year standard & 3 year accidental ? Is it from the date of purchase of the laptop or purchase date of the warranty?\n* How's the overall Linux support? I am the type that needs Linux as a daily driver and only use Windows for Gaming and tends to dual boot. Legion is said to have most options available in Vantage software also in BIOS so is the BIOS options reliable?\n* If you own a Legion Slim 5 or any Legion 5 series. How's your experience so far? Any complaints or quality issues?\n\nPS: First time purchasing something expensive like this. Upgrading from a dying Acer Aspire with i5 8250U & MX150 and hoping warranty would be a safe guard in case any heavy repair had to be made considering it's Liquid Metal compound so they'll only do Board replacement and not chip level fixing.

            "You cannot game in 2k with the specs in any game whatsoever. But buying 27 inch 2k is a viable option. It would give you more room for coding and viewing content in 2k is noticeably better than 1080p. You can obviously game in 1080p though.

My friend bought this and I assure you there weren't any problems. But do make sure that your unit doesn't come with deadpixels.

The Lid wobbles a lot and is often too thin with nothing to support or reinforce it. So if you accidentally put your laptop in a bag and place it on the floor or any hard surface vertically, it's own weight will break the panel. ( The spare parts are expensive than other brands & warranty is way expensive than other brands ). ASUS would flat out reject such cases with lame excuses but you're less likely to break their panel just by placing in wrong angle. That's what happened to my HP. And the laptop's keyboard dies quick for no reason? Random keys will stop working. ( Both mine & my cousin's keyboard keys stopped working in random keys ).\n\nAcer was the savior in my case, Got an Aspire 15 and it's served me well for 5 years. Still keyboard works fine. Back-lit keyboard's all keys are well lit. 1080p helped me well during my college and work. But it's now old and battery is not the same as before, and randomly shuts down. But a laptop surviving 5 years in my hands without any major issues under use of an average 12 hour every day is a great feat.\n\nAnything not Hp, Chinese phone brands, Colorful (brand) would be more reliable.

It's chess in fps form.\n\nNfs:mw 2005, forza horizon series\n\nBest racing games, nfs if you want story and gameplay. Forza of you prefer newer graphics.\n\nSekiro\n\nBest Parkour assassination souls like game. You can also try assassin creed series.

I'm confident that you will have a great time with Alan Wake 2 if you haven't played the original. Remedy has designed it to be sort of standalone, in that Saga Anderson \u2013 one of two playable protagonists \u2013 arrives in the Pacific Northwest to investigate a series of ritualistic murders with little knowledge of the events which occurred when Bright Falls was dragged into a horror story back in 2010. Anderson offers a new perspective on the Alan Wake mythos, not to mention the wider Remedy Connected Universe, and is able to effectively introduce you to the weird plotlines, characters, and otherworldly action that occurs across the adventure.\u201d",

Plenty of games have divisive communities. It just comes down to personal preference. AW2 isn't an objectively bad game.

Alan lost his wife, was chased as a fugitive and went through hell to beat the dark presence back into the lake, sacrificing himself to save his wife, who still died in the end without his knowledge. He was trapped in the dark, forced to write constantly in a state of near madness for over a decade and is constantly going through periods of instability. Saga on the other hand, over the course of a few days, fought a few cultists, was unable to contact her family (the incident was completely localised to bright falls for the entirety of the game) and found her absent grandfather and patched her relationship with him. Don't give me shit about saga suffering enough compared to Alan. The fact of the matter is Alan is a piece of shit who cares not for anyone but himself. Sacrificing himself for a goddamn stranger is the most out of character thing he could have done. In fact, the more heroic character was Saga, which is why her not facing ANY lasting consequences sits badly with me. She is far more the type to sacrifice themselves for \"the greater good\" than Alan. !<",

Don't talk to me about \"have you not played Alan wake??\"\n\n\nI know all about how Alan has suffered, I even relate to a lot of his struggles.\n\n\n>!Did you miss the part about where Alan thought that he had NOTHING to lose because he thought his wife was dead? Alice faked her death to bring Alan to that point, mentally. so that he'd be willing to do whatever it takes to defeat the Dark Presence. And it works. Together, Saga and Alan dispell the Dark Presence from Casey and, when it attaches itself to him, Alan. It is defeated (Alan's doppelganger is dead), and Alan is free. Saga, Alan, and Casey are all still in that writer's room, but Alice is in the dark place now.!<\n\n\n>!yes, while the Logan incident was localized to Bright Falls... It was CLEARLY growing. It was becoming more and more real. Or did you miss David's call when he tells Saga to fuck off?!<\n\n\n>!\"Stop. For once, you need to listen. You left me. You took my daughter away from me. Then you let her... She's dead because of you, and I don't ever want to hear your voice again. Stop calling me.\" Oh and fun fact: David DOESN'T live in Bright Falls. Saga came quite close to losing her daughter!<\n\n\n>!Not once did I deny Alan's suffering or say it was greater or lesswe than Saga's. I just simply said that Saga had been through enough stress, especially considering the fact that she AND HER FAMILY was dragged into this by the story. And I completely fail to see why she should suffer any real consequences, like her daughter dying or whatever. The idea of balance and \"paying the price\" is something that has existed since the first game, it is not a new concept. So one hero pays the price (driven to that state by losing EVERYTHING and not having anything to live for), and the other one who also suffered in the story gets to save her loved ones.!<\n\n\n>!Luckily for Alan, he still has Alice. Her suicide was just a ruse played by her in order to get Alan to a place where he would basically have the character motivation to not care anymore and just go for anything. Alan WAS a selfish, hotheaded jerk. But going through these events, living in the dark place for 13 years has clearly changed him. And ofc, at the end of the final draft ending, Alan wakes up and sees Saga and Casey there with him, and he is okay. He has even become the Master of Many Worlds. They pretty much defeated the horror story, but it implied that Alice is now trapped in the Dark Place, cuz she jumped into Cauldron Lake and called Saga when she was there!<\n\n\nAlso, please, for the love of God use paragraph breaks so your entire argument is a lengthy BLOCK of text lol.",
            "The story is written in such a way that it's much better as a playable experience rather than a movie or show",
            "They VERY much invested in Max Payne 3. It was an incredibly expensive game to make and it is VERY polished. It has their best combat system.\n\n\nWhat you're talking about, re: milking a game for all it's worth, has only been a thing since the days of GTA Online, which came out AFTER MP3 did. Before GTA Online, Rockstar has always been focused on making single player, story focused games.",
            "It\u2019s an obvious nod to the character, besides Sam Lake can\u2019t say it publicly anyways as Remedy doesn\u2019t own the IP, same goes for Alex Casey..\n\nYou can watch Gaming University for more context on this..",
            "yes since gta 5 they have been more focused on just two games and cancelled other titles like Agent etc. But yes, we gotta give them their flowers for Red Dead Redemtion 2 and Gta 5 too",
            "When the AWE expansion for Control launched, Remedy officially announced their Connected Universe. At this point, Alan Wake Remastered, Alan Wake's American Nightmare, Control, and Alan Wake 2 are all in the same continuity. Quantum break may share the same canon but that doesn't mean that it's part of the remedy universe. Even more so because Microsoft owns the ip. So unless remedy gets it back, it's still not part of the remedy universe."
