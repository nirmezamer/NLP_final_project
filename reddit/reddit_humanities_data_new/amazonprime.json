            "With two-day shipping taking two weeks, I\u2019m seriously wondering why I\u2019m still paying for Amazon Prime.",
            "What the actual fuck is going on?  I thought maybe it was just a fluke, but I'm noticing all kinds showing as 4-5 day shipping.  For example, right now, I was looking at something, and it won't arrive until Thursday.  Wasn't 2-day shipping part of the deal when we signed up for Prime?  Also, Amazon just raked in billions during this \"pandemic\", while other businesses failed, and this is the shit we get??",
            "Prime orders from the middle of last week that say on the order page:  Due to Arrive Today:  4\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOrders that have actually shipped: 0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSupport representatives giving me the runaround, blaming me for not understanding what 'Prime' means, saying that the estimate isn't a guarantee (what did you base 'Today' on when you estimated if you hadn't shipped?)  and otherwise making excuses for being unreliable?  More than I can count.",
            "Can we talk about the round Robin of chat support reps coming in and out of your chat window?",
            "Something clearly has changed in the past month or so. 2 of the 6 items I've ordered in the past few weeks have literally arrived late even after shipping out and every order I place sits in limbo for 4-5 days before it even ships out.\n\nThis is how you lose your number one spot. Someone else will come along and claim the throne if this is how its gonna be from now on.",
            "Something has certainly changed the past 3-4 weeks. I have been using Amazon prime for oh geez, I dunno, like 10 years? It was usually pretty awesome, up until about a month ago. I started noticing that literally NO items were available with 2 day shipping. Most items took 3-7 days to arrive from the day I would order them.\n\nActually looking back even further, they pretty much silently removed 1 day shipping back when covid was getting bad. But this new issue has nothing to do with Covid, there's no way.\n\nI don't need some Amazon shill or CS rep telling me \"Oh, well, the shipping still only takes 2 days! It's just the fulfillment that might not be, which isn't technically part of Prime!\". I don't give a fuck. It was 2 day shipping AND fulfillment (unless it was a sunday) for YEARS up until a month ago.\n\nFucking Amazon. Cancelling my prime right now. They already banned my original Amazon prime account of 9 years because it got hacked and the CS rep wanted screenshots of all my bank info to get my account back. Yeah, no. I don't need to give a CS rep all my banking information because MY ACCOUNT WAS HACKED.",
            "I came here to see if I was the only one who has seen their delivery dates extended in the past few weeks suddenly. Looks like I\u2019m not alone. \n\nI do want to mention that I saw a comment posted on a thread on the Pittsburg subreddit regarding Prime delivery delays about 9-10 days ago. The post is supposedly from an Amazon delivery driver. They mentioned Amazon implemented a nationwide change recently in how they deliver. I guess prior they had two rounds of deliveries daily (one during regular 7-5 hours and one later round). Apparently Amazon wanted just one round of deliveries daily, so they put everybody on something like an 11 am-9 pm work schedule and as a result, tons of drivers have quit. This individual seems to think this is why we are suddenly seeing these delays.",
            "I will be not renewing my prime. It\u2019s taking way too long to get my orders to justify the price. Back when it was true 2 day shipping I loved having it . Plus last time I had an issue with an order I was not treated very well. I will use other sources to order stuff or Amazon free $35 shipping when I have to.",
            "I joined this sub just for this thread. I am nailed to the wall here because I dont have the option for brick and mortar shopping for everything anymore. I am taking care of elderly immunocompromised family members who have not gotten the shot. So all their shopping or things they want/need I need to go out and get. So I dont want to go out and hit many stores, for fear of bringing something to them. The only store I actively go to is a grocery store. Anything else, i order from Amazon, and paying for prime as well. \nWhile I do use the other prime benefits as well, the main reason for me buying prime was the two day shipping.  Prior to this duplicitous act, with Amazon's third party delivery people, the delivery update said to expect things to arrive between say 12-2, then 2-4, then 6-1015, then we are sorry things are running late, then would appear at night or around 2 thr next day. And now, I would be lucky to see my orders in 5 days if not a week. And I live less than 10 miles from both an international airport and an Amazon distribution hub. And even after complaints to amazon I still have no answers.",
            "This is an example of what is happening. Same item .. two different zip codes in same city.\nThis is all items in the site.  One  zip will be delivered tomorrow, the other would be delivered next Thursday. Same post office, ups and fedex distribution center for both zips. \n\n\n[estimates](https://imgur.com/a/HKcEN6i)",
            "Every prime item I put in my cart is giving me delivery times of 5-6 days. Seems like that started happening over the last 3 weeks or so. I am in the Denver area by the way.",
            "This is honestly getting ridiculous. Pay for \"2 day shipping\" and it takes 5 days before Amazon even ships the item out, let alone the actual delivery time. Kind of crazy I can order some of my products from a store that is across the country from me and receive them in 2-3 days reliably, yet it my last 3 things ordered from Amazon took 7, 7 and 6 days to arrive when I live just a hair over 1 hour from my regions main distribution hub (and the origin location listed on all the packages shipping).",
            "This is crazy.  A week ago I ordered a couple of Prime items at same-day delivery and got them the same day (as often.)  A few days later, EVERY item across the site is minimum 3, usually 4 days.  Customer \"service\" just plays head games and lectures about \"well it's two days to get it shipped!\"  Then why was I paying for prime to get the same shipping as everyone else?  That's why I, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE, to CANCEL AMAZON PRIME ASAP to send a message to these greedy megalomaniacs that they can't just get away with ripping us off and playing games when it's like, hello idiots you're already richer than god, so what is your problem to begin with?",
            "Order placed May 1. \"Now expected May 13 - May 18\"\n\nOrder placed May 11. \"Now expected May 16 - May 18\"\n\nOrder placed April 23rd. Absolutely zero updates through May 15th. Then suddenly on May 16th, the tracking updated to say it was delivered on April 27th.\n\nThis past month has been the worst I've ever seen.",
            "I was gonna order some prime stuff today (a Monday) and they say it's not gonna get here till Sunday. \n\nWhat gives??",
            "Some orders have taken up 2 weeks to be delivered even though they are Prime items. What's the point of me paying for prime if it takes so long for my stuff to get to me? I live in Toronto! It's not like I live in the middle of nowhere.",
            "Yes, they are pulling that BS here now. If I ordered anything today (Thursday), with a Prime account and ordering direct from Amazon on an item labeled \"Prime\", I won't get it until Monday. They do the BS of \"one to two days delivery _AFTER SHIPPING_\" But it can sit in limbo and not move and that will satisfy the Amazon lawyers. \n\nJust last month they would ship it the day I ordered it and it would get here the next day. Those days are gone. Why am I paying for Prime? Free shipping option would have gotten it here also on Monday. So WTF, Amazon?",
            "I spoke to a representative through their Live Chat option. I've been waiting on my keyboard and mouse for over a week, then received an email that said the purchase has been rescheduled and added an additional two days for delivery.\n\nI basically told the rep we only pay for Prime because of the supposed convenience of fast shipping time and for the benefits I received when I was a student. I kept the membership active for shipping benefits and because we watch a decent amount of Prime video.\n\nThey automatically sent me a canned response saying not to worry, that I'm a \"valuable customer\" and they will refund me for the price difference. Basically making it sound like I was getting some kind of special waiver from the price increase if I kept the membership.\n\nThe rep said they are not responsible for delays in shipping after the order leaves their warehouse. So they offer this misleading \"special shipping deal\" and then turn around and throw UPS or USPS under the bus. You'd think that a company that's on track to make 2 TRILLION in profit could figure this s*** out. They should look into hiring their own delivery drivers rather than spending so much on the drone program (which is not really an option for rural customers) or being dependant on third party delivery service.\n\nMaybe Amazon should be more clear in what they are promising.. Maybe compensate their employees with a fair wage and offer better benefits... Maybe they could keep the warehouse robots going (great business decision, but imo is bordering on unethical behaviors). There aren't any consequences for their shady practices because it's legal. Amazon offers several services, so technically, there's competition for those services. Legally the FTC does not consider them a monopoly at this time.\n\nThe saddest part is that Amazon will continue to profit even if there was a boycott. Which will never happen. I feel that they are taking advantage of the pandemic, knowing full well some folks depend on home delivery and some have no choice.",
            "After reading a few of these posts, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not the only one having serious issues with them (as horrible as that sounds).\n\nHad a huge Amazon warehouse open in my city finally. After a year of it being open and placing numerous orders, one of my orders FINALLY shipped out from the local facility (about 8 miles from where I live). Got the shipping notification Thursday at 1630 (430) that the package had shipped out from the local facility and was in transit to the PO (USPS). I figured cool, itl be here tomorrow then.\n\nCheck the next day in the AM and what do I see? My package is all the way on the opposite side of the state!!! How does that make any sense at all?! To ship it out locally, and then end up across the damn state only to have the package come back to the same place of origin for delivery???!",
            "I just sent this email to Jeff Bezos' email address (which is public.)  It's highly unlikely it'll actually make it to him (his team reads them unless he gets curious) but it'll make it to somebody (who will probably offer me a $10 gift card to 'fix it'.)  But it still needed said, and I think it's worth saying to others.\n\n------------------------------\n\nMr. Bezos\n\nThis is not about a single order.  It is about a pattern.\nI spoke with you earlier this week about problems I've had with Amazon lately.  That was about four orders that were overdue and hadn't actually been shipped, and a rep that insisted that I just didn't understand how dates work.  Later, Amazon realized that it was actually their mistake.  They then packaged that order with one other order (so it hadn't even been packed on the delivery date) and then promptly lost all five.  I received a tracking number that UPS had no record of. I contacted Amazon support again and reported the problem.  They told me that there was no problem, didn't check the tracking number issue, and told me to wait it out, absolutely promising that it would arrive today.  \n\nTwo days later - today - I contacted support again about it, and this time the rep checked, and sure enough, the package was lost.  It had been lost ever since I'd reported it the first time and they hadn't checked.  They offered me a replacement for four of the five orders - the last was no longer available.  Some of the items are for preserving perishables (also bought from Amazon), so the only thing I asked for after all the hassle, delay, and runaround was expedited shipping to get those perishables safe.  I was promised that would happen with the careful phrasing, \"fastest shipping speed.\"\n\nI was misled.  There *is* no expedited shipping, and the replacement items aren't expected for five days, on the exact same date they would have arrived if I'd just ordered them off the page.  The representative misled me to mollify me.\n\nDuring this same week, I received a box of tea I'd ordered.  It arrived in a thin paper bag, completely smashed, the bags ruptured.  I reported it.  I received a refund.  I was guaranteed that it would never happen again.  The thing is, this is *fifth* order of tea I'd received damaged or destroyed because the fragile box was packed in a paper or plastic sack.  Four of those orders were reported.  Every single one resulted in a promise to forward it to the packaging department and guarantee that it would never happen again.  I have the chat records.  I have four guarantees of the same thing.  Again, this is a pattern.  I've had heavy tools packed with small items arrive with the packages torn and the small items missing.  I've had 8x10 soft back books packed in a large box with cases of water.  \n\nBut it isn't just that.  In the past two or three years I've received misrepresented products, items that were completely different from what the seller led me to believe.  Absolute junk knock-offs that have hijacked ratings from other products to trick people into giving up their money.  Weights that were less than a third of the advertised weight.  Adult shirts printed on material as thin as a plastic grocery bag sized for a toddler.  One item was straight up dangerous and had several reviews of people who had been injured because of it.  I reported it - and it is still there, still for sale, and still described as something other than what it is.\n\nTwice I've ordered items from companies that ended up being scams, companies that never actually had products.  Want an example?  Search for \"ice dice\" on Amazon. See the blue and white ice molds?  That's a product from a Kickstarter that hasn't even been manufactured yet. I know the guys who are making it.  That product doesn't actually exist.  None of those shops are capable of having that product; every one of them is a scammer looking for victims.  And this is just one that I know of personally, and an obscure product at that.  There are tens of thousands of these items on Amazon.\n\nI've been with Amazon for almost 19 years. I was a Prime 'early adopter.'  I convinced friends and family to join Prime.  But now I'm doing my best to avoid shopping at Amazon.  I am ending up the victim of scammers and of con artists, I'm ordering what I need and getting it destroyed, I'm getting items so late that the need for them has passed, even if I ordered them early.  And now Amazon is refusing to acknowledge reported problems, leaving dangerous items up for sale, and their representatives are straight up lying to me to make me happy. As much as I can, I am going to have to start looking for products elsewhere.  I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere, and there are no stores that sell specialty items.  Amazon, with Prime, was the answer.  But it isn't anymore.  It's not reliable anymore.  I'm spending so much time dealing with problems with orders that paying for shipping elsewhere ends up costing less, is faster, and will actually result in me getting the items I need.  \n\nThe subject of my last email included, \"You can do better.\"  You can.  I hope you do.  And if you do, I'll be back.  But until then Amazon will be the last place I check for what I need, and only if it is a low-priority item. It just too risky.",
            "promise a date to get you to buy.  \n ship it whenever the fuck they feel like it. That's how amazon works. Their dates are about as trustworthy as their reviews.",
            "I to have been having the same issues as everyone else and am getting the run around. Live in Central Ohio with 4 distro centers and cannot find a single item anymore that has 2 day shipping.\n\nHas anyone actually been able to find any? The Amazon CSR rep says if it's coming from a distro center by me it should be 2 days. Find it hard to believe that all of the distro centers by me are now empty....",
            "[deleted]",
            "I'm in the Denver area and have run into this delayed shipping issue starting about 2-3 weeks ago.  Just got off the phone with CS and I received the same run-around that 2 day delivery is from time of shipment and not time of order.  Couldn't give me a straight answer when I asked about same day delivery, and 1 day delivery being guaranteed from time of order.  If this doesn't resolve itself shortly, I will not be renewing my membership after 10+ years.",
            "I'm done with Amazon. I went out to a couple local shops and best buy for everything and took it home after an hour of shopping and grabbed some beer too. Now I have a 40 core dual xeon in an awesome case with 128 GB of RAM 4TB SSD and another 80TB of WD red HDs. Going to go pick up a powerware UPS this afternoon after some math. Dealing with real people vs some order screen with incomplete specs and trying to find guidance with reviews and people who don't understand my needs because they built their gaming PC so they can nit pick. I'm not mining nor am I gaming. I just need a lot of VMs using different VPNs at the same time on my workstation. I'm hunting and mapping this bitch out and it might take a few years. And every week counts. Amazon is out. Bye bye Jeff.",
            "The reason I'm a Prime member is solely for fast shipping. Since this is no longer the case, what's the point. After I finally get my last two orders, I'm canceling. I never used any of the other benefits with Prime.",
            "I just canceled my prime membership due to delayed shipping and the sorry your package is delayed message. You can also add and the reason that put me over the edge to cancel is not leaving package where asked (chatted several times with customer support), I live in an apartment building with 34 other units in my building and leaving it at the front stoop instead of at my door is not acceptable. The resident across from me and several others from this and other buildings have had packages disappear when they are delivered to the front stoop. Add on that most items ordered are now days away, I used Amazon to get things next day and now that is gone for most items I order. The other reason and what is no longer true was the good price for items. Last of the complaints are all the crappy items and fake reviews. Add all these together and I realize I can use New Egg, Walmart, Etc... and not pay a membership fee.",
            "Found this article today about Prime not being two day any more for lots of people. Interesting to see this getting some press but no real solutions: [https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/9/7/23333406/amazon-prime-2-day-shipping-delays-taking-long](https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/9/7/23333406/amazon-prime-2-day-shipping-delays-taking-long)",
            "Clearly something is very wrong with Prime nowdays, cancelled my membership today also and will buy from shops in the future. They are defo not worth the \u201cprime\u201d title anymore, nothing is prime about them.",
            "I\u2019ll order a product on Amazon because it\u2019s advertising free 1-day shipping - as long as I buy it within a time limit. When my order finally ships, it changes to 2-day shipping.\n\nNot the biggest deal to wait another day, but it keeps happening. Amazon should own up to it. I\u2019ll complain to CS and just get the runaround about shipping times, etc.",
            "Is anyone getting prime 2-day shipping on Amazon? EVERYTHING I\u2019ve searched for the past 2 weeks shows at least 5 days. I\u2019m not talking random items from 3rd party sellers. This is common things like eye drops that show sold and shipped by Amazon. If i select \u201cget it by tomorrow\u201d then the earliest delivery date is Thursday and it\u2019s for things like rifle scopes ((because those are definitely related to eye drops)). I live within 40 miles of TWO Amazon distribution centers, how can there be nothing with 2-day shipping?\n\nI\u2019ve contacted them and they keep sending me to this generic website that explains shipment times as if I don\u2019t know how shipping works.",
            "All Prime products are showing 3 day delivery for me, with an 11:59 pm cutoff. So for example, to get something by Friday, you have to order by Tuesday night. I don't even see an option to upgrade to faster delivery. This has been going on for like a month or two now. This is really frustrating and not what I was promised for $119/year.",
            "We just finished some research on this by test ordering identical items from Amazon, some with Prime accounts, others without. Amazon used to slow down processing non Prime orders and still claims lengthier delivery for non Prime customers. But in every instance, we found this was no longer true. Prime/non Prime orders arrived on the same day in every instance. Amazon dispatched emails to non Prime customers telling them their packages were arriving earlier than estimated. It is now clear Amazon is using the same fulfillment regardless of membership. Two day shipping is long gone and Amazon booked a major boost in profits. There is no reason to keep Prime unless you want their video streaming.",
            "Just cancelled my membership. It felt very good. When I started prime it was $90 a year then it increased to $119. When I started using prime I received shipped packages in 2 days now they average 2 weeks. Hope more people do the same. Amazon Bezos Prime has became to big for their own business.",
            "Seriously considering getting rid of Prime. It's September 5th and all the Prime shipping dates for anything are for fucking SEPTEMBER 17TH. This is getting majorly out of hand. I never use any of their other services. \n\nI used to order from Amazon 2-3 times a week. Now I barely order once a month.",
            "6pm today: Your package is 10 stops away\n\n10:30pm tonight: It's still coming, but it's been delayed\n\nLast time this happened they delivered my textbook to a woman in a completely different town at night in the pouring rain. Luckily she was nice enough to bring it to me the next day (soaking wet) but wtf. Fingers crossed I actually get my books this time \ud83d\ude11\n\n**Update: It just got delivered!**",
            "> Amazon Canada here. They're not even trying to do anything close to 2-day shipping any more. Now it says they will just email you when they have a delivery date. The item is IN STOCK, it's sold and delivered by Amazon, but they just won't give any delivery date promise. I get that there are logistics issues right now, so I don't want to be unreasonable. But when your business model is all about getting you fast shipping, at what point are they obliged to give you a refund on your premium subscription?",
            "I'm dumping Prime as well. It used to be good but now with the shipping delays and the price increase it's just not worth it.",
            "Gotta love this BS....my package left Tulsa, OK yesterday which is 2 hours away (about 124 miles) and now when I look it's in Lowell, MA instead of Lowell, AR which is almost 1600 miles away....",
            "Canceled prime today. My phone case was supposed to arrive yesterday, it was lost in transit. I move across the country tomorrow. Delays have been happening regularly, and they are raising the price to $140/yr when you can't even get 2 day shipping anymore. Got my refund and dropped them.",
            "\u00a0I'm curious why a package that shows as being one stop away, literally four  \n to five blocks away, will turn into \"running late\", \"now expected tomorrow\"   \nand then \"you can ask for a refund if not delivered today\" ?\n\n When I get a notification that the driver is 5 stops away, they are already   \nin my immediate area. Why would a delivery get so close and then stop?",
            "6 days to a week shipping for everything lately. I see I\u2019m not the only one experiencing this\u2026",
            "I guess this is something that has been going on for a long time. I am in south eastern Michigan and we had 2 day delivery up until a week ago. We had this storm and thats when the deliveries started saying a week out. I thought it was because of the storm. But I thought it'd be fixed by now. But it is still shitty. I used prime because I have kids and we homeschool. I run a business out of my house. I need thing quick and Amazon is the place I can just about anything. So this really sucks. When I messaged them, they said that its \"always\" been 2 day shipping. Which is a lie!! They know its a lie. But that is what they're going with. This is all new to me. So its very upsetting. But after reading lots of comments, I see this is something thats been going on for a year at least in other places. I guess we were one of the last ones to get this new update in services. Because its evident that is what they're pulling here.",
            "I had a \"guaranteed\" business delivery yesterday. It even said it was out for delivery and would arrive by10pm. It was a very time sensitive order, and I ordered this particular one to get it on time. Now I am out lots of potential sales. (They're seeds, I run a growing microgreens business, and our sales have done a sudden increase) Sure enough it did not come. I reached out this morning and encountered the rudest customer support person ever. I then received an email from him saying he wanted to help, and that he tried to call (he did not) and to contact them back, because he wanted to help me, but needed me to do a small favor.  I proceeded to contact them back via chat and kept getting disconnected and getting new reps when I was arguing my point that it's totally wrong to guarantee something and not fulfill it, and then not even try to do right by the customer. I actually had one tell me that they were putting out a priority shipment, and that it would be here in the next 3 hours, only to get disconnected from him and have another member tell me 5 minutes later that it was arriving tomorrow. I then got disconnected from him. And the last woman I spoke to said she was going to issue a report to her specialist support team, and that was that. I didn't even get a damn gift card, despite being out potentially hundreds in sales. Any idea what else I can do?",
            "Switched to Walmart, Target and Lowes. Prime claims 2 days to DELIVER \"guaranteed\" at checkout, then doesn't ship for five days or more, ships via ground and I'm lucky to get my items in 9 days, usually takes 14+ because Amazon isn't using 2 day shipping, and then, when I complain, blames UPS for not delivering the thing that Amazon shipped, ground, within 2 days. Nuh-uh that's not how shipping agreements work. If Amazon makes a promise and then doesn't pay UPS to keep that promise the blame rests with Amazon, not UPS.\n\nMeanwhile my Walmart and Target orders get here in 2-3 days. Lowes takes 4-5 but their main selling point isn't fast shipping, its that they're delivering stuff I'd otherwise have to drive 2 hours to get and that I can't get elsewhere affordable. So no complaints there either.\n\nI have complained to the BBB, the Washington state AG and to the FTC about the fact that amazon expressly promises 2 day shipping in its prime agreement and no longer gives 2 day shipping. Which is a breach of contract. No one cares. Amazon customer service expressly doesn't care so don't waste your time with them, just switch to another store if speed matters to you.\n\nOh, for reference, I'm in Eastern WA, about an hour away from the guy who wrote the Vox article.",
            "Advertised shipping timeframes are a complete lie. Amazon is apparently saying that 2 day prime shipping is from the time the order is actually shipped, not from the time the order is placed. So when it says, \"order with the next 2 hours to get your item in 2 days,\" it's completely meaningless. \n\nI ordered an item on October 8th - prime 2 day shipping. It's currently the 10th and being \"prepared\". It's estimated arrival date is the 15th.\n\nAnd because the item is being \"prepared\" I can't even cancel the order. I just have to deal with 7 day shipping, despite paying for 2 day shipping.\n\nHow is this false advertising legal? If you want to check it for yourself, this is a recorded message from Amazon customer service.",
            "It's fucking hilarious that Amazon expected everyone to stay on Prime just for their TV and Music.\n\nlooooooooool. They fucked around and they're gonna find out.",
            "I cancelled Prime last week, no way in hell am I going to pay the yearly price increase come January for this pathetically slow shipping.",
            "How does Amazon mess this up?\n\nDelivery was supposed to take place on the 1st by 10pm. Green bar under the map was mere PIXELS away from being on \"delivered\", and it doesn't get there. It's the 2nd and I'm writing this at 11:30pm, delivery was now supposed to take place an hour and a half ago but is still \"running late\". Just tell me you lost it or it hasn't left the fulfillment center yet. The green bar really set me off, why the hell do I let these Amazon people cuck me.",

I got a notification that a delivery was attempted but failed. Thought it was strange since no other delivery has failed for where I live, there\u2019s not gate or anything confusing. I decided I would just order the same thing again while I waited since it is a product I use regularly. Well the same thing happened with this package as well (meanwhile still getting other Amazon shipments.). I assume it is because it does not fit into the mailbox? I called the number usps left and rescheduled delivery and it specifically asked where it should be left but nothing. Finally just reached out to Amazon for a refund since it\u2019s clearly not getting delivered. I think that they just down want to carry the 40 lb box to the second story..which is why I ordered it online for that convenience. Do they mark it as an attempted delivery if they don\u2019t want to your door?",

Thursday evening (the day they were to be delivered), all three orders suddenly are updated as shipped and delayed in transit. It's now Sunday evening and no update since Thursday. I've chatted with representatives who can't shed light on why this is happening, and have also talked with a rep in Logistics who can't say anything other than they are sorry and will make a note on the account.

They also used to deliver items themselves earlier in the year, but lately it\u2019s been only USPS. Wonder if that has something to do with it.\n\nHonestly the only things I like about Prime right now are the Visa card and Prime Video. The 5% back on Amazon is nice, plus the targeted offers are usually pretty good, and Amazon Video does have a decent amount of free content.

The customer service person just stated the 2 day shipping and not 2 day delivery and that the item was on back order until the 11th.  I asked why I was now being told the 11th but my order is saying expected delivery on the 3rd.  The person replayed I hope your day is well and it ends with a smile and left the chat. \n\nI understand the supply chain issues, the work force issues but be up front and honest about them.

I work from home and order things on a daily basis.  Most of my projects are time-sensitive so this pattern of packages being delayed is completely unacceptable.  When I reach out to Amazon the best they can do is offer me a free month of Prime.\n\nI don't want a free month.  I want you to live up to your SLA.  Not the BS SLA you just made up last month, but the one that is in your literature and the one I signed up for all of those years ago.  Don't give me the COVID excuse either.  I could completely understand when it was a few months in, but we are now over a year since the outbreak and the world is starting to recover yet your delivery times are progressively getting worse.\n\nI know your trillion dollar company won't miss my paltry 1k-2k I spend a year, but hopefully enough of us peons will cancel where you do care.

But then it doesn't come today and now they say it will come by the 5th. But they are like you can cancel delivery and get a refund why isn't that satisfactory?  I could have gone to the store and gotten an external hardrive there.

I could count on 2-day shipping on most everything and didn't mind the occasional extra day or two for some Prime items.  \n\n\nFor the last few months, shipping times have gone to 2 weeks or more. My last two orders were estimated to ship in over 11 days so I canceled them and made other arrangements. Out of frustration, I used to chat to ask about the situation. The first rep told me that I had simply failed to request 2-day shipping! I told him that there was no option to do so and he told me I just wasn't paying attention. When I offered to send screenshots of what the order page looked like, he dropped from the chat. Someone else came on and was fixated on the very last item I ordered and then told me that all I had to do was choose the 2-day option. Again I offered to send a screenshot of what was on my screen with the soonest shipping offered being 11 days away and asked exactly what I was getting for my Prime membership - he ghosted me, too. I was willing to cut them some slack if they'd just been honest and said they were struggling and hoped things would get better soon.

            "Been a Prime member for a few years now.  Originally I'd have 1 package every few months that would arrive a day later than originally noted.  Fast-forward to today, nearly every package arrives a day or even 2 later than noted.  The thing that gets me is the have enough packages being routed to know where delays are likely, so use that data to let me know in advanced that my package originally promised for Wednesday is arriving Thursday.  \n\nTruth be told, my reason for subscribing to Prime wasn't based on 2-day shipping, but rather that I could order any item and ship it \"free\" and not worry about getting to a minimum.  That is to say, I wouldn't be as bothered if Amazon simply said *the item you're ordering will arrive in 5 days, not 2*.  Having this information early on would subside any annoyance because Amazon is sticking to the date they promised.  \n\nMy most recent annoyance occurred when I ordered an item specified that it would arrive Wednesday.  This was important because I was hopping on a plane Thursday and I needed to bring the item with me.  Well Wednesday came and no item.   It wasn't until 10pm that I received an email that my item was delayed -- well, no shit!  It was too late to cancel, so I asked a neighbor to grab the package that would be left at my front door while I was away.  Thankfully I trust my neighbors.  \n\nBut the worst part was that Amazon had to have known well before this point that the package would be delayed, yet they didn't send any notification of a late delivery until well after the delivery timeframe. \n\nHonestly, with the price increase, I was wary about signing up for another year eventhough I did it just before the price increase.  But at this point, it's very unlikely that I'll be renewing my subscription once it ends.  I'm not a fan of Walmart, but the few orders I've done with them have been flawless in every way and there's no subscription needed.  The fact that this sub-reddit has a dedicated rant section only goes to show that my thoughts are confirmed as well as I might have over-stayed my welcome with Prime.",

I go to the site, check, they tell me it's good now. On the second evening I add a credit card.

I clip the 20% off coupon and put the item back in my cart intending to reorder and cancel the original since it hasn't shipped yet. I go to checkout, but the discount does not auto-apply. I try manually entering the 20% off code but it says it's not applicable. I try the $5 code, also not applicable. WTF. \n\nSo I chat in and immediately get the run-around. First they insist there are NO offers on this item even though I'm literally looking at the two offers as I type. Then they tell me I have to clip the coupons first to get the discount.

Every time Amazon does good for a while- deliveries on time, smooth returns, products meeting expectations- they pull some petty shit and piss me off all over again. I guess I jinxed myself by defending them yesterday. I don't understand though, why lie and argue with a 12 year customer when *your* site is glitching?

            "Just here to rant...  Planned on doing some computer upgrades over the weekend, ordered some stuff at Microcenter but saw could save some money ordering power supplies from Amazon and a CPU cooler MC didn't have in store.   The power supplies were eligible for same day delivery on Friday and the cooler next day delivery.  Wasn't going to do upgrade on Friday so just checked box to have power supplies delivered Saturday with the cooler.    \n\nChecked status Sat. morning and nothing besides order was picked up.   4p.m. Sat afternoon the order arrives at a carrier facility in Delaware (i'm in Maryland),   Despite Amazon still saying it will arrive that evening, I know unless the truck drives directly to my house that isn't happening.   Then later that night my order goes to ANOTHER facility in Delaware (Can't even get out of the smallest state.)    Oh well, i'll get it Sunday right ?  Wrong.     After going to Philadelphia it finally got to Maryland facility this afternoon and hasn't moved since.  Get notification it *should* be delivered tomorrow.   So much for my upgrade plans for the weekend.\n\nSo items that were marked as Same Day and Next Day shipping are at least 3 days.... and Amazon had note on my order that I had to wait until after Thursday to request a refund if they weren't delivered by then.\n\nLesson learned...Amazon is not dependable for time planned activates anymore.",

If you don\u2019t have it by that day you may cancel for a refund.\u201d \n\nSo that next Wednesday approaches, and you notice that the app does not show any updated tracking info for this tardy package.

The supplement, which is just pills in a bottle, was scheduled to arrive today (Friday).  so I checked on the shipping status this AM.  At roughly 3 AM this morning, it arrived in my city (we have at least one distribution center here, and i think they are building a 2nd one) At 5 AM, it arrived in a city on the other side of town, and around noon, it went out for delivery, from the same city, which is under ideal driving conditions a good half hour away.  I checked just after noon and had a WTF thought, which I shared with my husband, because i can't imagine they'd send someone this far from that city when there are multiiple distro centers on my side of town.   So I just checked again, and that part of my order was cancelled,  the specific actions were \"Stop and Return Request Received\" and then \"Customer Refused Delivery\" which I most certainly did not.   Anyone else have a similar experience?   Now I'm not sure if I should reorder the pills or just go to the local health food store, which I almost did in the first place so I could get them 2 days earlier . . . .  The stand is supposed to arrive Sunday, I hope it comes directly here",

I end up talking to CS again to see if they could get any filament at all to me in a reasonable amount of time since I'm on a rush project, which resulted in a simple \"no\" after a half dozen links to the wrong kind of filament, the wrong size of filament, filament with expected delivery dates a week or longer out, and even one link to a product listed as \"currently unavailable\".  I next asked if I could can get at least a partial refund for this year of Prime since they're not delivering on the promised benefits, to which I received another \"no\" in return. I then asked if they would refund me the cost of expedited shipping to get filament from anther retailer since they've been screwing me over anyways on Prime charges and I really need filament ASAP, which was also a \"no\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis company sucks.",

            "Thursday: Ordered a bunch of camera equipment (almost $5000) and everything was listed as \"Prime\" and in stock at the time of amazon payment.  Wasn't paying much attention when I pressed the buy button but wasn't worried since I am a Prime Member.  I was anticipating the 2 Day Delivery and given everything was in stock I figured I'd have it by Monday (Thursday to Monday is 3 days).  To my surprise, when I checked the delivery dates Amazon reported a 7 day delivery.  One part of the order actually shipped on Friday but still said it would be delivered on Friday.  If Prime says delivery in two days then whats going on here?  Seven days to deliver goods that are in stock? What am I paying Prime for.\n\nSo I called Amazon customer service and talked with a lady who was very understanding but had no real answers but did apologize.  I pressed her further until she had to go talk with her manager. She came back to me and said that the manager told her to tell me that they have no control over shipping and that there suppliers ship based on availability.   I told her that was not acceptable.   As a major online reseller, Amazon has the ability, especially as big as they are to require from their suppliers that if they add the PRIME label to their products then they must ship to the customer within two days.  \n\nI'm thinking of cancelling my PRIME and just ordering the standard way.  I think I will get it just as fast.  In some cases I am beginning to source my shopping needs from other places.  A lot of places now are offering free shipping anyway.   In some cases the reseller on Amazon marks the price up in order to cover their shipping costs.  I did buy the camera body from another supplier because Amazon has too many sketchy resellers trying to make a buck on used or international product.  I found out that if you buy international model of a camera body, it won't be supported in the US by Canon or other repair shop.  Come on Amazon, its like a slight of hand.\n\nI think Bezos is distracted and Amazon is suffering. Stop the space ship stuff and focus on your core competency.  Otherwise Amazon will be another Giant that falls to poor leadership and loss of integrity with customers.\n\nAnybody else agree?\n\nAnyway off to talk to the wife about cancelling PRIME....",

I have delivery instructions to bring items to my door, but the last person who actually did that said their instructions say to leave things in the lockers, but it was the weekend and it one of those delivery people who don\u2019t actually work for Amazon and use their own car, so she couldn\u2019t get to the lockers. \n\nAnywho, packages say delivered.

I got confirmation of refunds on two of the cases, but I don\u2019t see the promotional credit.

            "Had an overnight delivery that was supposed to be delivered yesterday.  Driver said he couldn't get to my front door, I live in a 2 story apartment building.  The amazon delivery drivers always just drop the package on the front porch, if whoever it's for isn't home to buzz them into the building.  This is fine.This driver decided not to do what they always do.  I got a message \"Unfortunately we couldn\u2019t enter your building but we will try again. Was expected Wednesday, October 5\" That was at 8:30ish in the morning yesterday.  It's 9:31am now and this package isn't even marked as out for delivery.  It's the same message I just copy and pasted.So we're on day 2 of overnight delivery and it doesn't even look like it's going to be out for delivery today. When I go to the support thing for shipping I can't talk to anybody.  I just have a series of \"where would you like this delivered\" options.  Like front door, back door, garage door, and so on.  I complained on twitter and the amazon support account asked me to go to a link, which was just the support shipping I'd already been to.I just love spending extra for over night and then playing the \"when will it actually be delivered\" game.  I really wish we could choose who we want shipping to go through.  Every time I see TBA at the front of a tracking number I just shudder cause I know it's going to be a shit show of an experience.  I'd rather it just come through USPS if it's a lighter package or UPS if it's a larger package.  At least with UPS I can say \"Deliver it to the UPS store and I'll pick it up.\"  I have no options for Amazon's delivery people./Rant\n\nUpdate:  Package wasn't even attempted yesterday.  They lost the package.  \"Apologies your package was lost in transit, we'll send a replacement overnight.\"  So I guess we'll see if the driver tomorrow decides they need what I ordered more than I do, say they attempted to deliver it, and then oops it got lost in transit. I'll update tomorrow when/if I actually get what I ordered for overnight delivery 2 days ago.  \nUpdate 2: The replacement was delivered.  Driver didn't knock, ring door bell, or anything.  Tossed package on the porch and took a picture as he was running off.  I know this cause I watched him do it.",

Really great sales tactic for compulsive shoppers though. \n* The Prime movie selection is 99% garbage for my viewing tastes.  I wouldn't buy these movies at 10 for $1 at a flea market.\n* The Prime music is atrocious in its ever-limiting selection of freebies, endless advertising for Music Unlimited, upgrading to \"pro sounds,\" or replaying the same shuffle music over and over, ignoring thumbs down, and on and on.

            "I've been a prime member since 2011 but I'm getting really fed up with Amazon. Last year they randomly banned me from leaving reviews and deleted all my reviews going all the way back to 2011. No explanation besides some generic message that I broke some rule, and no response from CS when I ask what rule I broke. Yeah, I did not break any rules. 99% of my reviews were positive with lots of 'helpful' votes, and any negative reviews were honest and polite. \n\nI've had two packages disappear into the aether just this week. Monday- I was the next stop, the van was one street over, but it started going the other way and the message changed to \"the driver still has to make a few more deliveries first\". I assumed they just reordered their stops but 10pm came and went with no package. I waited all week and it never arrived. Thursday, different order- I was again the next stop with the van one street over. This time, the van just sat in the same spot for a while so I thought maybe the driver took their lunch or something, but then it started driving away again. \"You're the next stop\" all the way back to the hub. Never got that package either. \n\nAnd last month I got the dreaded \"package delivered to a safe place\" with no delivery photo and no package. CS wanted me to go knock on my neighbors' doors to find it but sorry, I'm not doing that. I'm happy to check my mailbox and look around my house, but it's not my job to hike around my neighborhood in the snow bothering my neighbors because your driver didn't do their job. That one at least showed up the next day(crammed into my mailbox). \n\nI never used to have this much trouble. I've gotten many deliveries to this address before so it's not like they can't find my house. And any time I have a delivery issue, CS does refund me but marks the order as a return. I have to chat back in and make them change it to cancelled so I don't get double charged for not returning something I never received. \n\nIt's really the lack of transparency that pisses me off. I know that shit happens, I've worked in logistics before. It's no biggie if something went wrong, but *tell me*. I won't get mad if they just admit the package got lost and they have to reship it, the driver ran out of time that day, the van broke down, the hub forgot to load my package on the van, etc. I appreciate honesty and will happily wait a bit longer if they just level with me.

First, every shipment now automatically defaults to my \u201cdelivery day\u201d THE FOLLOWING WEEK.  If I order on a Monday, delivery defaults to the following Thursday (my delivery day)\u2026.10 days from now!!!! And if you choose the buy it now feature, it automatically chooses this.  Sure you can change it, but sometimes I forget!  \n\nNow I go in to order my weekly groceries and see a delivery fee! First they do it with Whole Foods now regular groceries.\n\nThe thing that irks me more than anything is there was no notice.  It just seems like they are trying to be sneaky.  This is not what I paid for!\n\nI see a massive class action lawsuit in their future and I am taking screen shots of EVERYTHING.  I\u2019ll be the star witness!",

If I order something that is \"shipped and sold by Amazon\" and it says it can be delivered on X day (no matter if X is 1, 2, 5 days out) then dammit, meet that obligation. You are a multi billion, if not trillion, dollar company. FIGURE IT OUT.\n\nIt's not just that, its the fact that some years ago they did away with email customer service and now you can only call or chat. I dont have time for that. I want to shoot and email off and I dont care if someone replies 12 hours later so long as I get a reply and a resolution. Nope, now we got to talk to bots or call someone we can barely understand through their accent. No apologies there - I want to speak to someone I can understand when I am having a problem.\n\nSo, Amazon, if you ever read this - it was nice but its over.

It sucks because the fast shipping was the only real benefit of Prime that I thought was worth paying for.\n\nThe most annoying part is that the orders aren't even being fulfilled for 4-5 days and then they are shipped 2-day.\n\nCustomers in the Boston area are able to get 2, 1, or even same day shipping from the same warehouses (assumption).\n\nThis makes it seem like it is a conscious choice to unfavoribly treat the customers in my area.\n\nThis is mostly a rant but also a question.

            "Really strange thing happened a week ago. I've been a heavy Amazon shopper and Prime member for 15 years.  Recently moved so was ordering a bunch of things the past few weeks, everything was fine. Around March 19, all my deliveries suddenly went from 1-3 days to April 2 (two weeks). Every single item that is shipped by Amazon showed that (3rd party shippers have various, shorter delivery times).  Talked to Amazon a bunch of times.  It looks like it's my whole zip code; any delivery address in that zip code shows Apr. 2 for all deliveries.  Any other zip code (e.g., the next block over) shows normal Prime deliveries (1-3 days). No rep had any idea what was happening, but they seem to be aware this an ongoing issue. I asked for a full refund of my Prime membership, and they gave it to me without any further discussion. Very strange. Would just love to know what is actually happening. And curious to see what happens on Apr. 2 onwards.\n\nEDIT: Further interactions with reps have been extremely frustrating. Lots of lies. \"It will ship soon\", \"it's in the advanced stages of shipping\", \"it's out of stock\", etc., etc.  Lots of denials that there is even a problem. Finally one said this:  \n\"We have been experiencing some unforeseen complications lately with shipping and/or delivery delays due to the constantly evolving workforce for both Amazon and our carriers due to these trying times.\"\n\nCould just be a generic BS statement to get rid of me, who knows.\n\nFINAL EDIT: All my Amazon packages did arrive today. Also spoke to people in my building and other buildings and it was indeed our entire zip code (which has over 50,000 people in it). Despite all this, four different Amazon reps insisted nothing was wrong, lied, made up fake excuses, and fought with me. I don't know what's going on at Amazon but it seems like it's falling apart. After I canceled my Prime membership, I started shopping heavily at Target online. It's not bad and some stuff is even cheaper than Amazon. I was there biggest fan for 15+ years but Amazon has lost me as a loyal customer.",

They do, tell me they will look into it and get back to me. They never did. Prime expired last month. I'm not going to re-up it.

The website looks like it was designed by a child, who was not exactly best in class, in 1997.  Hey Amazon, go check out the B&H website to see how it is done.  Once again, the stuff I need for a job is coming late.  \n\nAfter seeing so damn many posts on this issue.  It may be long past incompetence and poorly treated workers.  I think this is deceptive trade practice plain and simple.  Knowing you can't deliver what you promise, and still offering it.  I can't see any other way to look at it.",

I received my package every time and it was never a guess.\u00a0\n\nWhat is happening is Amazon is pushing ppl towards other retailers instead because they use actual well established shippers and the packages arrive when they say they will. If Prime didn\u2019t also come with the Prime video content I would have dropped it years ago. I may still.\u00a0",

So now I have to read a PIN to the driver - never had to do that. Never had an issue with theft here and never complained to Amazon something was stolen. Considering Amazon said they could get it to me overnight, it must have been local and not shipped from out of state. And why the new delivery time of \"before 6pm\"? Shouldn't I be prioritized since you already missed a deadline? You expect me to wait all day on a Saturday because you f\\*\\*ked up the day before? If they can't deliver on their accelerated delivery dates, then what is the point of Amazon?\n\nAmazon's whole thing is being  able to get items to you faster and at a good price, or better price. That hasn't been true in the last couple of years for me. \n\n* I buy fewer and fewer things on Amazon now because the price difference isn't as compelling.  Looking at the last 5-10 things I got on Amazon, or thought about getting, I realize I can get those things elsewhere for the same price, albeit slower shipping (which isn't a plus for Amazon anymore) or I can get them for a better price altogether.\n* There are more, and better, sites for bargain items like [Greenspot.com](http://Greenspot.com) and Swappa and even Target and Best Buy, who have several stores near me where I can get something myself.\n* They have their own fleet of planes and trucks and drivers, but shipping is worse than ever. I've cancelled lots of things that I could have sworn were supposed to be 2-3 days, but after the order it's suddenly a week away. For months I used to complain that the drivers were too lazy to come up my driveway; they routinely go out of their way to walk across the grass. Know who never walks across my grass?

It's been 15 days. I'm so mad. I want to cancel prime for that money back but how long will that take? Will I even get the full refund? Probably not. CFPB needs to sue them for more than the Prime bs. They need to be sued for giving people misinformation and making people wait for and fight for a refund for items not delivered properly or returned.

The map shows he is still in my area but unless he stopped for a long siesta I don't believe it. Honestly ever since Amazon went to Next Day (which rarely happens) and using their own delivery the service level has greatly deteriorated. I have told customer service that but always get the same response, we understand and are sorry. It is so frustrating and I never see any comments about this outside of forums like this.

            "I know this is gonna get lost in the mix and probably no one will read it, but I have come to the conclusion Amazon prime is a compete scam\u2026 why you may ask\u2026 well let me tell you \n\nOn Thursday July 8th my 3 year old decided to throw one of our Peugeot salt/pepper shakers down a flight of stairs and it broke. Well as a quality conscious individual I decided not to spend the 160$ to replace it on the spot, and research other items that may be more child friendly.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the following day July 9th I realized we had no other way to grind pepper while making breakfast, so I decided to just order the grinder via Amazon prime guaranteed 2 day shipping with a guarantee the item will be delivered Monday July 12th.\n\nOn the other hand my fianc\u00e9 decided to surprise me and ordered a complete new set without me knowing on Saturday July 10th (I guess we should communicate more) not even being a prime member from the same seller. And this is how I found out. \n\nAnxiously awaiting for my package that shows it hasn\u2019t even shipped yet, a package arrives earlier yesterday\u2026 well damn!!! What did she order now lol. To my surprise I  open the package and see 2 grinders, some gourmet salt and pepper and a nifty table tray holder and mini table shakers. sweet action!!\u2026\u2026 I called her and she let me know what was up and yes I was happy but wtf\u2026. I\u2019m a prime member and ordered a prime package guaranteed to be here over a day ago and nothing. \n\nI check my Amazon account and the item still hasn\u2019t even shipped yet and the updated delivery date is now Wednesday the 24th\u2026.. how the fuck is that possible????\n\nThis is where I am completely bewildered on how a non prime member can order something and get it 72 hours later but a person who has paid for prime has to wait almost 2 weeks for an item that stated it would be here on the 12th \n\nSo to test something we both placed the same order for the same item one with prime on my account and one without prime on her account for a prime item at the same time. (It was a 3$ baby\u2019s shark sticker set nothing special). Low and behold her item is scheduled to be here Friday the 16th and mine is scheduled Tuesday the 20th \n\nIt\u2019s clear prime doesn\u2019t matter and it\u2019s complete scam. \n\nWe don\u2019t use prime video or prime music as we get YouTube and Apple Music for free along with Netflix and Hulu etc\u2026 I only paid for prime cause we have spent over 400k through Amazon in the last 2 years (because of Covid mainly) and I thought it was beneficial to my impatience on receiving items, but it clearly isn\u2019t. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t even call it delayed shipping.\n\n it\u2019s more like let\u2019s take peoples money for a service we refuse to honor and fuck them over in the process while we cater towards non members to swindle them into paying for a membership so we can screw them later and still get money. \n\nIm completely vexed with Amazon at this point and would  rather spend my money anywhere else but there. \n\nI have canceled my membership and don\u2019t plan on ever supporting Amazon ever again.",

Can you tell me why or let me know when it might change?\n\n\rAmazon: We're still fast because shipping is two days (even though our total turnaround time is comparable to mailing in an order to Sears in the 90s).

It would make sense if all of our rural area was impacted but for it to take a week for us, when we are in between the fulfillment centers and the further locations, it makes no sense to me.

Do I refuse the UPS delivery? Do I accept it and wait to see what Amazon does with the order? I\u2019d like to avoid any possibility of getting my account flagged for their screwup.

I can choose a residential address 15 miles away and have an estimated delivery of tomorrow or 2 days every time. Then switch to my address, and the estimate becomes 3-6 days.\n\nI've even tested ordering the same item to my address and a nearby Amazon locker. The one to my address didn't even leave the warehouse for 3 days, while the one to the locker arrived the day after purchase.\n\nI have a theory that Amazon significantly prioritizes deliveries that can be made via their own trucks. That seems to be a difference in my address area and the others I've checked, and the time they were introduced here roughly lines up with when delays started happening. \n\nI hit up Amazon support chat now and then when I get frustrated enough.

I live 8 hrs north of Vancouver.  Canada Post is doing fine as well, even with international shipments.  I have only had one or two Amazon shipments go awry in the past year, so this was kind of shocking.\n\n**This is wild**:  two PC cases I ordered **Nov 24, 2021**, that were supposed to take a *week* for delivery, are now set for a delivery date of **March 4, 2022.**  A six-pack of PC case fans ordered on **Nov 29, 2021** is now set for a **March 11, 2022** delivery.  Other items have just been changed by weeks, which I am fine with.  But **3 months** is very odd.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Another oddity:**  I ordered the same two PC cases a week later **Nov 29, 2021.**  Those are set for a **Dec 20, 2021**  delivery.  A couple weeks, despite Amazon Prime shipping promising a week for delivery.  Not a huge deal, but **why is the exact same item coming 3 months earlier.**\n\nAmazon chat support was a loop of scripted answers.  I don't fault the support worker, it's a job and I would imagine they are doing what they are asked to do.  Though, I do question the existence of a poor customer support system.  Waiting game for items commences.  \n\n\nEDIT:  I received the two PC cases today, which was a day later than originally promised.  These were the **March 4, 2022** cases.  I have no idea . .",
            "So I just discovered a new scam. Any subscribe and save users out there? I currently have approximately 29 items that I subscribe to. Lately every order will be missing 4 to 7 items. They initially label them as delayed, and eventually unavailable. Here's the kicker. If you go on Amazon and want to purchase any of those items individually they are always in stock. However, what happens is you lose your subscribe and save discount, which can be significant when you're dealing with as many items as I do. And I have chatted and called Amazon so many times to ask why they don't apply my subscribe and save price to my subscribe and save items when they fail to deliver them on time and force me to repurchase. You can imagine what Rajiv said. \"Oh, we do not have the capability at this time. I cannot do that from my workstation.\" So basically Amazon ends up getting an additional $12 to $20 from me on my subscribe and save items every one to two  months. I'm slowly transitioning to Costco since we have a house and more storage now.",
            "does anyone know what has suddenly happened with amazon?  Anything I want to order says it is at least 2 weeks before shipping (I live 30miles from a pretty big fulfillment center).  I understand things are crazy now in terms of supply chains, but a simple explanation from amazon about what the issue is and what the likely timeline on it will be, would go a long way from keeping me from canceling my prime membership.",
            "There is literally nothing available to order from Amazon.ca that will arrive before Xmas. Not a single thing. Wtf is the point of paying for prime if I can't use it to do Xmas shopping 2 weeks before Xmas?\n\nMeanwhile, there's still stuff I can order from Costco and best buy that will arrive in time.",
            "My package is arriving today after a day delay, I'm genuinely surprised considering it came from the other side of the country and all the tornadoes and shit. On that note, rest in peace to the workers that died recently. I think all facilities need to revamp their disaster protocols.",
            "I cut Amazon Prime, but continued to buy on Amazon.  I noticed that Prime does not get anything to you faster, as advertised.  I use non-Prime free shipping and everything still arrives in a week, just like Prime.  I also noticed that if you complain to Amazon chat about a shipment \"hanging,\" with no updates, they will get the product to you in 1 to 2 days.  This has happened to me twice.  Just some advice for users.  Cut the Prime and complain to chat.  If there is a \"hang\" and no updates, no matter what chat says, there is probably an issue.  Someone dropped the ball somewhere and Amazon didn't notice it and they won't acknowledge it.  Paying for Prime is really just giving Amazon free money for doing nothing extra, as advertised.  Sure you get access to free movies, but they don't cycle in movies fast enough for the money.  You can get free movies through other legitimate apps, that cycle in free movies faster.",
            "I have packages that were supposed to be delivered today but I received the \u201con the way but running late\u201d message\u201d but my mom who lives less than 5 minutes away got hers today.",
            "Well Amazon have totally botched my deliveries this morning. Expecting two packages. Tracking shows both are together and expected at the same time. Delivery man hands one over I ask him about the other one and he says he doesn\u2019t have it. I guess it\u2019s gone missing.",
            "1. On December 9, 2021 Order (114-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx) was placed  \n\"Ships from Amazon AND Sold by Amazon\"\n2.  December 11, 2021, I wanted a piece of information on the product, so I clicked on the link for the product\u2019s Amazon Page. Upon opening the product page, I noticed that up in the top right-hand corner of the product page it stated **\u201cFREE delivery Thursday, December 16. Order within X hrs XX mins\u201d**. I thought \u201cThat\u2019s unusual\u201d and asked myself \u201cWhen was mine to be delivered?\u201d. I reviewed my order and saw that it was to be delivered December 21st and at that time had not shipped yet. I thought \u201cSurely my order will ship quickly then. Either today or at the very least on Monday, December 13th\u201d. At this point, I had two options. Option 1, Let the initial order continue and trust Amazon to ship my order quickly OR Option 2, Cancel my initial order, re-order with the quicker delivery date, and wait up to 10 days for Amazon to refund the initial purchase. I decided to trust Amazon and put my thoughts to rest feeling assured that Amazon would be on top of the order.\n3. December 13, 2021, I logged in to review my order hopeful that it had shipped or that there would be at least some update. **Especially since it was evident they had enough in stock to make delivery based on their product page.** Alas, this was not to be the case. Upon logging in, I saw that my product was not shipped yet. I reached out to Amazon via the online chat at this time. I was not rude or ugly to the Representative, but I did ask a few pointed questions that directly reflected how I felt about the situation. Exert from Chat below  \n\u201c1:58 PM ME  \nso Amazon is fulfilling those orders from Dec 11th before mine which was ordered on Dec 9th  \n1:59 PM Mohammad Xxxxxx| Customer Service  \nYes  \n1:59 PM ME  \nGee... that seems wrong...there is defintely something wrong with that pcture  \n2:00 PM Mohammad Xxxxxx| Customer Service  \nExpected delivery: Tuesday, December 21, 2021\u201d  \n\u00a0\u00a0 I am very aware that the representatives have extremely limited influence or access to the fulfillment side of the house in such a large company. In the limited capacity, the representative answered my questions as per the script they are to work from. It still did not resolve my issue and was extremely frustrating to learn that Amazon would act in such a manner. I felt like Amazon was putting me to the back of the line. The first thought that went through my head and has popped into my head several times since this issue began, was \u201cWhy am I paying $120 USD per year for a Prime Membership if Amazon is going to simply shove me to the back of the line?\u201d. I began looking for a way to send an email to Amazon Headquarters in order that they might review and possibly improve fulfillment processes to prevent this type of occurrence to other customers. As I dug deeper into Amazon site pages, I began to realize that Amazon has done just about everything in its power to prevent customers from reaching out to them. Amazon has created such a convoluted process for an average user to reach out for assistance that it is almost impossible.I finally received an email address to be able to send a message to with a brief synopsis of my issue after I reached out to Customer Service yet again ([CS-reply@amazon.com](mailto:CS-reply@amazon.com)).\n4. December 14, 2021, Order still has not shipped. I typed up a message and sent it from my account to the provided email address. I immediately got a reply from  \"nobody@bounces.amazon.com\u201d stating \u201cYou've written to an address that does not accept incoming direct e-mails\u201d. I reached out again via Chat as it seemed to be the only way I could reach anyone. It turned out that the email address provided does receive messages. The email address simply shunts incoming messages to a different queue for \u201cpossible review\u201d. The Customer Representative in Chat was able to bring up the email I sent and review it. Whether it was forwarded to any management personnel, I am unsure. I still wanted some way to contact Amazon Headquarters though.\n5. December 15/16, 2021, Order still not shipped. I was provided with a phone number for Amazon Headquarters (1-206-266-1000). This turned out to be, yet another contact point specifically designed to prevent communication to Amazon Headquarters as it provided nothing but an automated menu to listen to prerecorded information with phone numbers back to the very Customer Representatives I had already been in contact with. Needless to say, I contacted the Customer Representatives yet again and asked to be transferred to a manager. When the manager representative came on the line, I once again explained what I was going through. **The manager brought up the product page and even she questioned why my order had not shipped as she could see the message \u201cdelivery Sunday, December 19. Order within X hrs XX mins\u201d on the product page.** (Granted, the date was different at this time but to be expected since a few days had passed since the beginning of my questions) I decided to take a different tack this time. I asked for and received the physical mailing address for Amazon Corporate. Hence, this letter pf my experience and dissatisfaction which will detail my full experience from initial order to receipt of product.\n6. December 17, 2021, Order still not shipped.(Scheduled to ship December 18, 2021 as per what I am told at least twice over the past week)\n7. December 18, 2021, Order still not shipped...  yep... that's right...\n8. December 19, 2021, Order still has not shipped. Contacted Customer support via chat. I was told that the order was still on track for delivery December 21, 2021 and that Amazon may be shipping from a distribution site that is close enough to allow one day or overnight shipping. Beginning to wonder if Amazon is retaliating against me for complaining as the entire debacle of this order just does not add up to me from the perspective of a customer.|  \nOrder \u201c114-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx\u201d was scheduled to be shipped out on Saturday, December 18, 2021. It wasn't. Maybe it will arrive on the scheduled delivery date of December 21, 2021. With the Holiday shipping along with other circumstances, I am of the opinion, \u201cI will believe it when I see it\u201d and \"I am not holding my breath\". I have severe doubts that it will arrive as scheduled. Maybe it will... There is always a possibility... Then there is the question of \u201cIf it does arrive, will it be damaged?\u201d due to the \u201crush of having the product shipped at the very last second?\u201d.  \nI will just have to wait and see.  \nSimply put, my faith in Amazon Fulfillment has collapsed.",
            "So my shipment was ordered Tuesday, supposed to arrive Friday. Says out for delivery, never arrived, next thing I know it says Package Delayed in Transit. Ok, whatever, says I'll get it by the 21st. So now it has just been showing \"Package is Being Relabelled and Forwarded with a Different Tracking ID.\" What? It doesn't even show up with the rest of my orders, I have to search for it and it still just says Running Late. Any chance I'm getting this shipment before Christmas?",

            "Hey everyone,\n\nI bought a GOXLR for $299 on Black Friday and as it turns out, the purchase went to a 3rd party seller rather than Amazon Prime like usual. Since the 3rd party seller seemed to be moving very slowly to ship the item, I messaged them via Amazon yesterday for a shipping update and got the a message sent to my e-mail saying:\n\n>*The seller your order was fulfilled by has left the marketplace or is no longer eligible to receive any further email communications.* \n\nI immediately contacted Amazon's customer service on the phone right after this and they didn't even know that the 3rd party seller was a fraud until I told them about this e-mail message I received. They said that sometimes 3rd party sellers get caught selling expensive inventory that they don't even have  at low prices and end up getting banned from Amazon like in this situation. I asked if I could buy the item at the original Amazon price (which would have been $399) and they said no. The item is now $549 which is a huge increase when compared to what Amazon's Black Friday price was. They offered me a $5 gift card.  \n\n\nWhat should I do? Is there a way I can convince Amazon to sell my this item at the Black Friday price that they had of $399?\n\nI've used Amazon for 9 years and nothing this wild has ever happened to me...",

We are wasting our hard earned money making the high ups in this company richer and they still can't get their shit together and honor their commitments to both customers and their mission statement. Not only do I pay the monthly prime fee but often I will order a certain amount for \"rushed\" shipping...one thing is perfectly clear...they don't care. You can spend thousands on products and you will get it when and if they feel like processing it. For a billion dollar company you would think they would have higher respect for loyal customers but nope....\nMore and more shit comes late and or damaged because of terrible employees and the fact they don't care, but one thing is for sure they are quick to take their monthly fees and payment for everything you order!",
            "Listen, I understand that shit happens, but after today I'm on 5 late items in a row. As someone who neither uses Prime Music nor really watches Prime Video, the only real reason I have Prime is to have my orders show up... well... on the date they're supposed to.\n\nI remember they used to offer digital credits or something of that nature, but couldn't dig up whether or not they still do; and trying to talk to a human at this point is a bit of a pain in the ass to do. So if I'm going to bother navigating the waters, I'd love to know whether or not they still offer anything.",

I've had five orders do this and not one was ever delivered.  The tracking gives a \"Package delayed in transit\" and never changes.  Waste of time.\n\nThen if I decide on a replacement instead of a refund.  Which I did three times of the five.  All three times they sent me an email to return the original or I'll get charged again.  The original never arrived.  I have to contact support each time to fix that too.",

It has a tracking number for this site called YunExpress and it already says it's already gone through the sorting facilities, arrived at international airport to abroad and now has departed from airport of origin.\n\nDoes it sound like I may be getting it much earlier than July 12-August 2?

But, if you call Amazon's customer service, they'll try to trick you into believing they are doing their part when they are not. Most associates and supervisors will simply pretend you are complaining about one delivery that got delayed, which obviously doesn't address the problem itself. I've tried to contact Amazon multiple times and they were always up to their \"you mean SHIPPING\" bullshit. It's been almost two weeks now, no reasonable explanation as to why One-, Two-, and Same-Day deliveries simply vanished from my Amazon page. And now everything is taking a minimum of 4 days, with items shipping the day before the delivery, so that Amazon can maliciously claim they are fulfilling the One-Day delivery or what not.",

What is going on? That's the same or worse than most other retailers. I just cancelled my Prime membership and got a prorated refund. I was happy to pay before, but what's the point now? The frustrating thing is that none of their customer service people have a clue about why this service just disappeared. Ridiculous. Time to short AMZN??",

            "And now I know why.  They just shipped all of the items due today with items I ordered later in the week.\n\n  \nIn other words, it really looks like they held on to my items for extra time after they were supposed to ship in order to save money by combining shipping.  I would be OK with that (as long as the items weren't late as a result)  from a store where I wasn't paying a premium for prioritized shipping.",
            "I\u2019ve noticed they\u2019ve changed a lot of \u201cguaranteed delivery dates\u201d to \u201cestimated delivery dates\u201d on my end. \n\nAnd I\u2019m considering changing my \u201cguaranteed yearly payment\u201d to an \u201cestimated yearly payment\u201d for prime.",
            "What changed is Amazon switched the majority of their delivery stations to a \"megacycle\" which resulted in massive numbers of warehouse workers and drivers quitting.\n\nFor example as a driver I used to work 8 to 6:30pm, under the megacycle it's now 11:30 to 10pm.  For the warehouse workers they are now scheduled to start at 2am instead of a day shift and a night shift that started at 8pm.\n\nMy friend works for a delivery company that lost about 80% of their drivers within 2 weeks of the megacycle starting. Mine lost about 50%\n\nI'm not as familiar with fulfillment centers but it's probably the same",

There are hundreds of trucks leaving, so I do think this is their first (and only) departure for the day. \n\nSo I don't have any inside information, but I can say my observations line up with your information.",

However, if I had sent it to my sister's house 50 miles away, it would have been delivered in 3 days. I do not believe for a second that a 50-mile difference would account for an additional 10 days of transit time. If Walmart can deliver to me in 3 days, why can't Amazon? And why on earth am I still paying for Prime?",
            "Something has fallen apart with their logistics recently.  Amazon really isn't amazing for prices these days, so the fast delivery with Prime is their major differentiator in my mind.  Without it more of my business will move elsewhere.",

            "yes- this has been going on for us in a midsize midwest city for probably about a month. i saw ONE item have a next-day delivery option yesterday. other than that, every \"prime\" item is 4-5 days+ delivery. it's disappointing to say the least. we got veryyyy used to the whole next day or 2 day delivery (from order --> door) from amazon over the last decade.\n\ndefinitely thinking of canceling prime when our subscription is up in June if this doesn't improve, but researching alternatives first. i refuse to switch over to Walmart because they treat their workers even worse than Amazon. \n\ni don't need every item i order in 2 days of course, but not having hardly any items fall into this option, while other major stores still are offering this delivery option for free right now....i just don't know why we'd keep prime (except maybe for prime streaming, which we only occasionally use).",
            "I've been getting delivery dates 7 days out, even for Amazon's own products! I used to see Prime trucks (a good 4-5 different trucks) driving all around my town every day, but over the last 3-4 weeks, I've stopped seeing them. Everything is now being shipped via USPS and next day/two day delivery is long out the window.\n\nHell, I've even noticed the Prime badge no longer shows up on the website or app, it just says \"FREE Delivery by \\[date one week later\\] for Prime members\". No badge, no \"two-day\" mention or anything. I've also received the same garbage from both their Twitter team and customer service chat.",
            ">I just unsubscribed from prime. My situation seems to differ from many of you in that I still get promised two days, but it gets marked delivered on the promised day without actually being delivered. At first, I thought it was theft, but I've been home when it's been marked delivered without ever seeing anyone. Whenever I talk to customer service, they always say it was a glitch or it was mistakenly marked delivered too early and to wait two days. Sometimes it shows up two days later, sometimes it doesn't. But it's happened at least ten times now. Part of the service I was paying for was convenience and having no idea where it is or when it's coming after it's marked delivered, and no longer trusting the tracking in general takes away that aspect entirely.\n\nbut yes he found a way to take his butt out of space though -\\_- but he cant our stuff here on time",

If they would just email me and say they are having logistics issues in my area and they are working on fixing it, I wouldn't be as ticked. Or if this is going to be the new normal for them, let me know that too so I could decide whether or not to renew prime. Instead, all I get from customer support is that there is no problem, or they don't know why the shipping is delayed, but will find out and call me back; but never do.",

I looked at the same exact listing and it said \"free prime delivery by Wednesday\" ????? I literally had to cancel the original order, reorder it again (for full price) for it to arrive today, and then I had to go full Karen on customer service to get the price difference credited to my account as I was promised... just makes no sense.",

Just today, I received a \"Shipping Delayed\" notice on a Prime 1 day delivery purchase. It said I could cancel the order, but provided no means online to do so. They need to get their sh*t together or this 15 year Prime customer will be gone.",

If I switch it to the zip code right next to mine, it will deliver Friday.\n\nAmazon is throttling the service by flipping a switch for certain zip codes.

There is NO excuse for the way they allow customer service to play dumb that it\u2019s not being systematically forced or the way they pretend that people in the unfortunate zip codes are getting the same service they did before.  \n\nCS will not escalate the issue.

Up until Thursday everything was normal 1-2 day delivery, after that it has all be next Sunday Nov 14th. Yet if I put in a zipcode about 5 miles away it will be delivered within 2 days (Wednesday) and if I put in my brother's zipcode (20 min away) which in the middle of nowhere it will be delivered tomorrow. If I put in the zipcode two miles on the other side of mine it will actually take even 3 days longer to be delivered. It's crazy! I don't get it.

If they can't hold up their end of the deal, they should be refunding the Prime membership fees. And it's the same problem here....2, 3, one day, etc., don't even show up on my checkout page, no matter what type of item I'm ordering from them, but I always make sure to order stuff that Amazon ships and allegedly qualifies for Prime.",

I order something on a Friday, and it said it would be delivered that evening!!  Wow, that was a surprise.  I thought it must be from the local warehouse.  Well, nothing that night except excuses  -- running late but still coming, etc. etc.  Last message said by 8 am next day.\n\nSo, next morning got up and looked for it all morning.  Nothing.  On line said - running late.  so, NEXT day, looked at tracking and said - running late, contact Amazon. \n\nOkay, I contacted Amazon -- which is NOT easy anymore.  Finally got past the bot and chatted with someone.  Tried the \"call me\" first , hard to even find that option any more.  They used to call back right away (tho a \"hold\" of course) but I waited for 10 min and didn't even get a call back at all!).  Evidently my package was Lost.  Lost in Phoenix.  I think I saw the movie.  And it was a delivery 30 min away!  \n\nAnyway, got the refund of course, but am more and more considering cancelling AP.",

            "and all we read about, is how much money they are making.",
            "This is true.  I just used BBB for the first time to get a refund and policy change from a restaurant that was committing open fraud.  Nothing.  Nothing from BBB in weeks and no response from the restaurant.  BBB is just making money, doing nothing.  With some of these bad businesses, you literally have to get the case to the Supreme Court before changes will be made.  Good luck with the lawyers, counter-suits, and money on that one!  The USA, unfortunately, is fraud friendly and has been for years.  After all, we are the country of \"faith healers\" and \"disease curing oils.\"  Some of our lawmakers still believe in that stuff and actively peddle it.  \"Free enterprise,\" they say.  LOL.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all about free and open business, but fraud should never be a part of that.  And fraudsters should be fined/sued out of business and in prison much quicker than they are now.  If you can't deliver, DON'T ADVERTISE IT AND DON'T TAKE MONEY FOR IT.  Pretty simple.  DOJ cares nothing about that though.",
            "Same here, my boyfriend and I contacted the BBB to report someone who literally took over $900 to provide a few voice lessons and help him create a \"killer\" voice over demo with \"custom scripts created and written by an award-winning VO producer\" (the award-winning part is unverifiable). After taking the money, he then did nothing.. provided no recording, no studio time, no training, no demo. We're lucky he didn't get us for the rest of the money, which was to be paid in installments. The only thing the BBB did was ask the guy for a few responses (back and forth and back and forth), to which he basically just kept insisting \"NO REFUNDS.\"     \n\nOur point was that a \"No Refunds\" policy is there to protect businesses from being taken advantage of AFTER they've provided a product or service. This guy literally took the money and did nothing. It seems pretty clear to me that that should be considered theft. If you hire someone to remodel your bathroom, pay them, and they never even touch your bathroom.. they shouldn't just be able to say \"NO REFUNDS.\"    \n\nThat was a bit of a rant, but yeah.. our experience with the BBB was extremely frustrating. The conclusion was essentially that we'd need to take him to small-claims court. Wtf does the BBB even do, other than log complaints? I thought they were meant to actually DO something... guess not.",
            "Why would you go to the BBB to resolve such a grievance?  They are a business with non stake in the dispute and no legal authority over anyone.  You should take the offending party to small claims court, which has the authority to hold the other party accountable and enforce the contract.  No attorneys are needed."
