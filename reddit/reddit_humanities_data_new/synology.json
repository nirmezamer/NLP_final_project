            "I can't help you directly, but if you suspect that it's RAM related (hence why you are posting in this thread) I may have some useful information for you.\n\nI bought a 16GB crucial stick listed as compatible with my DS920+ and installed it about 2 months ago. Worked flawlessly.\n\nThen I (stupidly) last week decided to upgrade the DSM version on the NAS to the latest. I believe from 7.1 to 7.2. Notably the screens said 'once updated the NAS cannot be downgraded to a previous firmware version' or similar.\n\nUpdated it to 7.2. Worked great for a few days. Then I had to power cycle the NAS at which point I got the behavior you described-- blinks for a minute and shuts down.\n\nTake out the crucial RAM stick on a hunch and... boom, works perfectly again.\n\nMy suspicion is that they have been allowing non-Synology RAM sticks to work for some time and with the latest DSM they are locking them out. Which is really too bad because I paid $43 for my 16GB crucial stick that worked just fine and... Synology wants $326 for theirs. Ugh.\n\nHopefully I'm wrong, and hopefully there are other sticks that are still working post this latest DSM update. I'm obviously not spending half the cost on a new NAS just for a RAM upgrade.",

            "I think DS224+ has an 'official' limit of 6 GB of total ram ( 2 + 4).\n\nJust go through the Ram spreadsheet and search for your model.

            "I think the pre-installed Ram is soldered to the NAS and unless you know what you're doing, I wouldn't recommend messing with it. There is usually only one slot that's available to the users (check with your model though). \n\nA NAS isn't doing that many parallel tasks so dual channel RAM probably isn't worth messing with a soldered memory. Getting an 8 or 16 GB stick depending upon your requirements should be more than enough",

So you\u2019ll have to replace those much sooner than 10 years.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to calculate your total cost of ownership, assume the worst case: a NAS lasting perhaps 7 years, HDDs 5 years. And don\u2019t forget to calculate cost of electricity. Depending on where you live in the world, that could be the biggest cost over its lifespan.\n\nCloud storage might not seem so expensive after all.
