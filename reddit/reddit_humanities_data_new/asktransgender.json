I'm always updating this map.**\n\nAre you thinking of starting HRT, but are worried about:\n\n- Finding a clinic\n- Having to do a year of therapy\n- Having to do \"real life experience\"\n- Getting gatekept\n- Spending money and not getting treatment\n\nWell... that is why **informed consent** exists. With informed consent, you require **no letters from therapists.** You simply attest your gender identity, say that you understand the risks and benefits of hormone therapy, and they begin prescribing and monitoring your hormone levels.\n\nSo... For too long, this information has been scattered around Reddit, Susans place, twitter, various out of date guides from different regional organizations, so...\n\nI laid my eyes on every single clinic website and doctor profile listed in this map. You should be able to call up any of them to confirm, and then start your HRT as soon as possible.\n\nPLEASE let me know if any of these are out of date or if I am missing some.\n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1DxyOTw8dI8n96BHFF2JVUMK7bXsRKtzA&ll=42.47025816653199%2C-97.03854516744877&z=4",

There are resources out there if it\u2019s seen as costly and that should never be used as an excuse. There are LGBT-friendly therapists as well. Doctors and therapists are not out there trying to stop us from transitioning. I promise.

It's next to impossible to become a new patient there because they never answer their phones, they do not return voicemails, and they are very rude to you when you go there in person.  I've tried multiple times (including calling them at least a dozen times) in the last two years to set up my HRT there and I've had to give up because I couldn't get past the desk staffs' laziness and never actually managed to get an appointment set despite all those attempts. And if you miraculously manage to get hormones from them, you cannot count on getting refills in time. The actual doctors will do it right then and there if you've got an appointment and speak to them in person. But if the staff need to pass a message to your doctor from you or a pharmacy to submit a refill for you? Probably not. At least not without making you wait for a few weeks without any of your medications.\n\nYou might want to take them off the list. I highly recommend any trans person in the Las Vegas area avoid that place like the plague. I do know of two more in Vegas that are not on your list though. One is doctor Haydee Docasar. She's been providing informed consent HRT to trans patients for over a decade. I used to go to her until I had an insurance issue causing her to not be covered anymore. I'm trying the other one I know right now, doctor Quang Nguyen at Las Vegas Endocrinology. A lot of people at my local trans support group go to him and are much happier than they are with Huntridge. These places will still likely ask for a therapist letter though, they say it's for insurance issues. But they don't have any of the rest of that nonsense gatekeeping. So it's informed consent with an asterisk. You still have one annoying hoop to jump through. I wouldn't bring these places up at all because of that if there actually were other options in Vegas.

Once, maybe twice a year if there are irregularities I can understand, but every 3 months in perpetuity is excessive. \n\nAnd while there *isn't* a therapist letter needed, part of their intake requires that you meet with their social worker. \n\nStarting hormones at Mazzoni takes at least 3 appointments; your first intake appointment, your second appointment to meet the doctor and get lab work, and the third appointment to meet the doctor again to review your labs and get a script.  This process itself can take weeks to months *after* you've already been on a - in some cases - year long waiting list.",

            "My PP also talked a big game and was subpar. They didn't say anywhere on their website that they did it. They showed up at Pride in 2019 and told people at Pride that yes, they do! So I gave them a shot. I used the online appointment form, and they didn't have anything LGBTQ or trans-related on there as \"reason for visit\" so I said birth control. When given a forced binary gender selection (I'm nonbinary and this wasn't a great sign) I selected male. I thought that maybe \"male + birth control\" was enough of a clue, but no.\n\nWhen I get there, I get an intake form with a lot of gender options, not that anyone notices or respects them, I'm treated as my AGAB, which is female. I'm told that even though they do HRT, they refuse to talk to me about HRT, that I have to go through some special intake process to get HRT, and that since I said birth control I can only have birth control. I try to explain that there wasn't a trans option on their online form and I have anxiety about phone calls (and about being overheard, I'm not completely out yet) and try to ask what kind of special phone call this is to arrange this or what the special meeting about Gender Issues is that they can't do now, and they're extremely vague and won't tell me what kind of gatekeeping there is, but make it sound huge and scary.\n\nEventually I get seen by this one nonbinary nurse who works there who is actually awesome. Still doesn't give me HRT, but we make an appointment to go over it in 2 weeks without the weird phone thing. I leave feeling more hopeful, even though that poor nonbinary nurse seemed to be dealing with constant transphobia in the workplace tbh.\n\nThen COVID hits. My appointment gets delayed, canceled, delayed, canceled. I'm told that they still do appointments for more birth control if I want some more of that, but trans people--sorry, trans services, are non-essential.\n\nI get a weird letter in the mail that my insurance declined to pay for my first visit, claiming it was out-of-network. I don't understand this and even though I'm not being charged money, feel anxious about sorting this out with my insurance so I can go back. I found out over a year later that PP filed a second time and my insurance paid it, it honestly feels like my insurance was dicking around because they don't like PP, probably to punish them for giving people abortion access.\n\nMy nonbinary nurse was furloughed during COVID, and eventually laid off.\n\nWhen I tried to make an appointment for HRT later, PP told me they no longer take new patients for HRT, saying it was because of COVID.\n\nI don't think any of this was because of COVID, I think they used the shock doctrine of COVID to get rid of the transtrenders they'd always secretly hated. Same as all the abuse of asylum seekers at the border is pure xenophobia and not about COVID.\n\nThrough every interaction with them, I've constantly felt like they were scorning me for being trans, seeing me as a whiny narcissistic gender-traitor who should just GTFO if I don't have a REAL problem like needing an abortion or something. (They did tell me multiple times I could come in if I needed an abortion, but not for trans stuff. I'm not pregnant and never have been.) And that they felt the same way about the one person who worked there who got me.\n\nI've honestly been real sad about it because as someone with a uterus I actually do care a lot about abortion access, but this kind of exclusionist feminism is part of the divide-and-conquer strategy that's leaving Roe v. Wade on its knees at the moment legally. It's so destructive both to trans people and to people who do need abortions and I'm so frustrated with it.\n\nI hate that PP is so often the best we have.\n\nThey're the only thing on that map within 100 miles of me, too. I excitedly clicked on it as well. And they're not taking new patients, indefinitely, because of \"COVID.\"",

I went to LabCorp locations.\n\nAlso I know at least where I live now (Montana), that for example if they need blood tests and you wanna have them at planned Parenthood then you can go to any PP and get that done even if that PP doesn't provide HRT. They can at least do a blood test there and send it where its supposed to go. Here the closest PP that does hormones is like 4 hours away.

That transgender people experience in healthcare and government every day is far more common then we realize.

Because if women stand up, if people of color stand up, if lgbt+ people stand up, if transgender people stand up, if disabled people stand up, if poor people stand up if all the marginalized people in the world stand up and stand individually and together. They won't stand a chance.\n\nOf course that's just my opinion, please do your own research. Dont just read things written about other people.

Unlike Spiro, it has virtually no side effects, and as an added bonus, it indirectly induces an increase in estradiol, causing some degree of feminization all by itself. The main thing preventing its widespread usage for MtF HRT is a low chance of abnormal liver function (~2% iirc, with around 0.1% being serious).

            "About 13 years ago, I took up a post as a mod on /r/transgender and from there moved to /r/asktransgender and several other trans subs. Over the years, my role has changed from knocking out the queue every night to keeping an eye out for threats against our community and speaking on our behalf when I can.\n\nThis has also meant there are plenty of times when I haven't been as active as I could have been or times when I've been burnt out just from all the stuff I've been juggling.  \n\nBut through it all, Java's been there. Steadfast and reliable. Year in, year out. I can't say we've always agreed on everything, and Java's also been right there to let me know when I'm doing something foolish, too, which fortunately hasn't been *too* often. I'm human, too, and I've had my share of moments where I've been bullheaded because I believed I was doing the right thing.  \n\nIt's a hard thing sometimes to stand up for what you believe in, but it's harder still to step up and tell a friend when they're being an ass, and Java's helped keep me on track there more than once.  \n\nJava's also been an absolute monster on our modqueue for *ages*. I know I can step away and do more things for the community as a whole because I know each subreddit has good people to tend to it and pick up the slack while my eyes and ears are elsewhere. Java's one of those people whom I trust; Java's got rock solid trust because Java *is* a rock solid person.  \n\nIf our mod team was a person, was a single body composed of different parts, I'd say Java was our spine. Moving us, supporting us, responding to new threats, keeping us flexible, helping us navigate the shifting political landscape.

She's too reliable, too valuable to him, and so he leans on her more and depends on her more. He expects her to get the job done, and she does, even though it means she's carrying more weight than her fellow teammates. Ender only realizes his mistake *after* he's done so, and Petra's units are reassigned to Bean to salvage the situation.  \n\nI remember that moment in the story, how human it was, how unusual, how realistic it was to see our team of plucky protagonists have a moment of weakness, a moment where they might fail simply because they've been pushed so hard, pushed to breaking.  \n\nI never meant to put you in that position - I know I did, more than once, and I am deeply sorry for it. I keep my eyes on a lot of things and a lot of people, and sometimes I too forget to check up on those who are closest to me.  \n\nI'm not some brilliant commander or epic leader; I see myself more like Bean, resourceful and ready to adapt on the fly as needed.

You gave me a solid foundation on which to stand and hold our shield. I could do that because I *know* you had my back.  \n\nYou deserved better, and I wish you all the best I can offer.  \n\nWe all owe you a huge debt of gratitude for years of dedication and hard work.

You've done so much more than anyone  could have expected to be called upon to do.  \n\nThere have been so many times, so many nights, when /r/asktransgender would almost fall off my modqueue entirely, simply because you were busy on the queues that night. I'd get a report and I'd go check it out and I'd see that you'd beaten me to it, sometimes by mere minutes.  \n\nI remember thinking, early on, that your username was well chosen because you must have had coffee on an IV drip or you were powered by espresso because how else could you power on through our queues and beat me to stuff so consistently?  \n\nAnd there were just as many nights when I'd see that happening and I'd go to bed happy, secure and confident in the knowledge that no matter what was happening, no matter what sort of trolls were battering our communities, I could take comfort because 'Ah, Java's got it.' or 'It's okay, Drewie's on it.'  \n\n*That's* what I'm talking about when I say you're dedicated and reliable. The knowledge, certain as a sunrise, that we're all safer because you were here, and I thank you for that. We all thank you for that.  \n\n#\ud835\udce3\ud835\udcf1\ud835\udcea\ud835\udcf7\ud835\udcf4 \ud835\udd02\ud835\udcf8\ud835\udcfe.",

It can be like treating trans men as less than men, insulting phalloplasties/surgeries/trans men's bodies in general, calling trans men confused girls or butch lesbians, being aggressive to or dismissive of stealth/passing/masculine/straight trans men for perceived \"privilege\", making assumptions about trans men, dismissing the struggles trans men experience, denying the existence of trans men, treating trans men like they don't exist, calling trans men female terms, fetishizing trans men's natal anatomy.

            "As stated elsewhere in the thread, transandrophobia/transmisandry is real. It's a lived experience for trans men and transmasc folks, particularly in more \"feminist\" spaces where masculinity in general is demonized, but in the wider world as well. \n\nSome people consider the term transmisandry problematic because they believe that it suggests misandry is a thing, rather than realizing it's termed such because it's trans-andry, not because misandry is a thing. Similar vibes for transandrophobia. \n\nSome people consider the concept problematic because they believe that any bigotry transmasc (as an umbrella term) folks face is simple transphobia (or, rarely, misdirected transmisogyny, though many claim that there's no such thing as misdirected transmisogyny). Because men and masculinity are valued in a patriarchal society, clearly there's no bigotry that transmasc folks face *because* they're specifically transmasc. The bigotry they face is because they're trans, instead. However, when trying to talk about transmasc-specific issues, folks were also written off for claiming it as transphobia, as transfemmes folks didn't face such issues. It became a catch-22 where transmasc folks were essentially forced to sit down and shut up (ironically, a form of transmisandry, I would argue). \n\nThe argument flares up on internet spaces on occasion, primarily, but has begun bleeding into offline spaces as well. It's a vicious cycle where transmasc folks are rarely allowed to talk about our struggles in a serious and specific fashion, and then people tell us that we're not really facing true bigotry because they never hear about our struggles. Rinse and repeat.",

            "Other people have explained the definitions / discourse better in the comments here than I could, but it's generally meant to be a word to describe the specific experiences of transphobia for trans men and transmasculine people.\n\nI've seen a lot of transmisogyny in online spaces that are big on using the word, focusing all of their energy into complaining about transfem people being maybe shitty to transmascs on Twitter rather than anything more substantial (obviously it's not good if someone's shitty about us, but it's also gross to spend all your time complaining about transfem people specifically - a lot of them act like transfems are uniquely bigoted against us which isn't true lol). I stay out of spaces that are big into using the word because of that. It's real Twitter / Tumblr discourse brainrot.\n\nHaving said that, I think there's value in having a word for bigotry against transmasc people specifically rather than it just being transphobia. I can say I experience biphobia, which is a unique experience from experiencing homophobia and lesbiphobia, and I can say that I experience enbyphobia or exorsexism as a non-binary person that's a specific form of transphobia - I have experiences unique to being a trans man and it'd be useful to have a word that can encapsulate that, rather than just 'transphobia directed at transmasculine people'.",
            "It seems like a lot of the objecting to transandrophobia is based on unneccessary pedantry. \n\ntransmisogyny is about the intersection of transphobia and misogyny, which no one really questions (except transphobes who deny the existence of trans people atogether).\n\nTransandropbia, say the pedants, must be the intersection and transphobia and the male equivalent of transphobia. But there is no systemic prejudice against men, so there can be no intersection of transphobia with something that does not exist, therefore transandrophobia cannot exist.\n\nExcept that's not what transandrophobia is, and thats not how words work. Here's what happened:\n\nPeople noticed there was prejudice against trans men - a type of transphobia that targets trans men, or elements of transphobia that have a specific effect on trans men. People wanted a word to describe that so they could talk about it and address it, and since it was targetted at men, they chose transandrophobia. This seemed like a reasonable choice.\n\nBut the discourse!\n\nThat should be largely ignored. Transandrophobia is a real thing. It might not be exactly the mirror of transmisogyny but it is a thing that exists, it needs to be talked about and addressed, and transandrophhobia is a fine word for it.",

            "Misogyny is the systematic oppression of women. Transmisogyny is the intersection of transphobia and misogyny, which effects trans women and some other transfeminine people in a variety of specific ways. A parallel can be drawn with misogynynoir - the intersection of misogyny and anti-black racism. \n\nMen, as a class, are not systematically oppressed as men (many men are oppressed for other reasons than being men - eg because of their race, their queerness, or their disability). Therefore androphobia or misandry do not exist, and so transandrophobia/transmisandry definitionally cannot exist - because there is no systematic oppression for the transphobia to intersect with in this case.\n\nThis does not mean that trans men and trans masculine people don't face particular forms of oppression that other trans people are less likely to experience. Black men experience a unique kind of discrimination that black women normally don't, but we don't call it \"androphobianoir\" or anything similar because it is the manifestation of anti-black racism towards men, _not_ the intersection of two kinds of systemic oppression.

But if you're a woman there simply is no way to win, under the patriarchy a woman who is identical to a man in every way except for their gender will be considered lesser. \n\nIf someone perceived as a man is being discriminated against due to the patriarchy it's because they are failing to meet some kind of patriarchal standard. If that happens this person will probably have the negative flipside of masculine stereotypes applied to them: the capacity to protect becomes danger, confidence becomes aggression, being the active party in a sexual interaction becomes aggression and sexual perversion, and so on. \n\nBut that's selective discrimination instead of the universality of misogyny.",

You'd rather they get stepped on so you can feel validated in your identity, despite also being at risk of being misgendered by someone else because they assumed incorrectly? \n\nI am a passing trans woman. My identity isn't dependant upon my gender expression. And if my default pronouns, by some random stranger who doesn't know me, is they/them, since they're not familiar with my pronouns, my identity hasn't been invalidated by that. If they proceed to use they/them after knowing my pronouns, *now* they're doing so to invalidate me. People aren't mind readers. Even if your expression aligns with gender norms, people will still make mistakes with assumptions. I don't know about you, but assuming every person is trying to invalidate you results in a lot of hurt feelings and a lot of alienation, particularly by potentially well-meaning allies and other queer folks. \n\nRather than act like you're being invalidated, consider who you're invalidating so you can feel valid by expecting every person to assume your gender.",

I significantly prefer if people don\u2019t assume my pronouns based on how I look, as do many other trans people, since the pronouns people almost always assume for me are incorrect.

I'm sorry for the length. I started drafting this response 2 minutes after you commented. \ud83d\ude05\n\nFirst and foremost: You're not wrong that degendering someone can hurt them.\n\nThe gender-neutral default for people we don't know approach, at least amongst my peer group, is specifically used because a person's physical appearance and outward expression aren't necessarily reliable indicators of their gender.\n\nPlenty of folks, cis and trans, don't fit neatly in to stereotypical gender characteristics.\n\nThird person pronouns aren't generally used for someone who is part of a conversation, either.\n\nSo, either the person to whom I am speaking knows and can inform me,    \nE.G.: I'm picking up a friend from work and see them speaking to a coworker.    \nMe: They seem nice!    \nFriend: Amir? Yeah, he's the new guy I mentioned I was training.    \nMe: Oh yeah! I see what you meant when you said he's stylish!\n\nOr it's said in reference to someone where neither of us knows,    \nE.G.: \"Sorry I'm late. The pharmacy had an issue with the prescription for the person who was ahead of me and had to call their doctor to get it sorted.\"\n\nThat all said, contextual clues can inform us to an extent and I will try to use them to the best of my abilty when appropriate.    \n\nLike, whether or not someone seems stereotypically \"feminine\", if I interacted with them in the women's changing room or a women's therapy group, etc. I could assume they are more likely than not to at least be o-kay with she/her pronouns. But I will still clarify with them if I can and err on the side of caution if I can't. ^(see: neutrality until I am informed)\n\nAnd if we're in group situation where we may refer to someone present in the third person, we're probably already aware of each other's pronouns.\n\nE.G.: Cameron(she), Alex(he) and I are chatting.    \nMe: [to Cameron] So Alex and I were hanging out the other day and his roommate said the funniest thing! [To Alex] Do you want to tell her, or can I?    \nAlex: Nah, you tell her.\n\nIt's not perfect, and there is admittedly still potential to upset people for sure. It's about mitigating that risk, I guess? \n\n^(And, of course, I'm not going to refer to someone as \"they/them\" if I am aware that they use different pronouns and I *will* inform/correct people when I know they're using the wrong pronouns.)",

I would say that is less harmful than assuming, because presentation doesn't always match. Being early in transition feels like the best example here. Even if the overall percentage of times where that happens may be low, I'd rather someone not feel singled out, especially in a group, and be the only person to correct me. That pressure can lead to someone not speaking up.\n\nIf I use they for everyone, then it isn't malicious, and being corrected by everyone makes the field even. I'm not sharing this to change your mind. You can want whatever you want, and do whatever you want. But I'm going to do the same. But now you my intention to use they.

You broke free from those norms to be who you are, be cognizant of the fact that you're now attempting to put those same shakles back on again by trying to fit yourself into the norms. If that's your expression for yourself, great! Express yourself to your fullest! But if you're doing it so society sees you for the man you are, you're holding yourself back.

            "Radical feminism is defined by overcoming male oppression of female people. A huge part of the oppression of female people is based in gender roles and gendered socialization. A huge part of radical feminism is completely ending the concept of sex distinction having any importance socially, culturally or politically, and a lot of radical feminism is based in resisting and ultimately overthrowing gender. So people having sex/gender identities that don\u2019t fit the most simplistic radical feminist narratives was seen as an issue. The solution was to call us fuck ups, perverts, and insane people, which was easy because that\u2019s what cis people had already been doing for decades in the name of psychiatry.\n\nSo, all this is happening in the late 1960s to the late 1970s. You have all that going on at the same time transsexual women began existing in society and refusing to be seen as crossdressers or drag queens. Some of these transsexual women were accepted into radical feminism, and did amazing work. Some of these transsexual women wanted medical treatment. Transsexual medicine was pretty fucked up at this time. Cishet white male doctors were weird and had weird ideas. One of the loud ones, Dr. John Money, was super fucking creepy, like mad scientist level creepy. Transsexual medicine was very gatekept, with women having to live as very stereotypical women for (a) year(s), they had to be straight, and they pretty much had to be white.    \n\nSo, all this intersects with Janice Raymond, a radical feminist, who decided the absolutely most disgusting thing she could imagine is transsexual women, and she wrote a book that is just absolutely full of hate and dehumanization of transsexual women. Mostly it is based on these ideas: (1) there is something inherently wrong with male human beings that they cannot escape (this is biological essentialism and is counter to radical feminism); (b) the cis white male doctors who are helping transsexual women are creating replacements for cis women based on the worst gender stereotypes; and (c) a lot of really mean shit about trans medicine as it existed at the time.    \n\nRaymond\u2019s book came out and transsexual women who were part of any feminist movement were subject to violence toward not only them but any women who would let them be part of radical feminist separatist spaces and orgs. It\u2019s little wonder that happened since Raymond directly accused trans women, **by name**, of \u201cr*ping\u201d cis women by just existing as post-op transsexuals.    \n\nWhere are trans men in all this? Dismissed as female, pitied for mutilating their amazing bodies that they could easily come to love, and erased by inclusion in radical feminism by radical feminists, just like gender critical does still. In fact, the surprising part for me, in reading Raymond\u2019s book, was that it\u2019s the exact template for cissexism and transmisogyny still used by Joanne and friends.    \n\nA few notes if you\u2019re interested in reading more. Raymond\u2019s book is radioactive. I read it early transition and sobbed in the library. So don\u2019t go wading into that shit unless you\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019re ready. Sandy Stone is a goddess who was one of the women named in Raymond\u2019s book and 8 years later she responded. Raymond\u2019s book was called The Transsexual Empire (1979), so Sandy\u2019s essay was called The Empire Strikes Back: A Posttransexual Manifesto (1987). Essentially Sandy said \u201cyeah, transsexual women behaved in line with gender stereotypes because that\u2019s what got us medical treatment.\u201d More importantly, in my opinion, she humanized transsexual women and asked other transsexuals to discuss their experiences so pigs like Raymond would have a harder time making up weird shit about us.\n\nThis interview is probably the best short way to learn a lot of early history between transsexual women and exclusionary radical feminists:    \nSandy Stone on Living Among Lesbian Separatists as a Trans Woman in the 70s    \nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/zmd5k5/sandy-stone-biography-transgender-history",
            "Because a key tenet of most radical feminism is that men are inherently, biologically evil. It forces them to come to a lot of objectively silly conclusions.

This keeps coming up, so I\u2019m going to quote a comment I made for a previous post on this topic:\n\n>\u201cRadfem\u201d is the modern, lay, pop-feminist movement among young women that apes the historical second wave Radical Feminism. Both are inherently bio-essentialist and inherently transphobic.\n\n>There\u2019s a lot of misinformation in these comments. Many commenters are not understanding the difference between \u2018radical\u2019 as an abstract construct and the specific historical movement known as \u201cRadical Feminism\u201d. There is no such thing as \u201cTERFs vs actual radical feminists\u201d\u2014TERFs **ARE** radical feminists. **Radical Feminism was a specific movement of Second Wave Feminism in 1960s through mid 1980s that took the racist bio-essentialism of the First Wave and applied it to gender.** It gave rise to Political Lesbianism and Lesbian Separatism. Intersectional Feminism and Womanism developed in opposition to this during the Third Wave in the late 1980s and 1990s.\n\n>**Radical Feminism is and always has been bio-essentialist and transphobic. TERFs and radfems are one and the same. They have a specific ideology, and that ideology is inherently bio-essentialist.**\n\n>Just because something is labeled \u2018feminism\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean it is good. Saying TERFs aren\u2019t real feminists is a No True Scotsman fallacy. Feminism isn\u2019t an idea, it is a movement of people, and people can be fallible. Feminism and feminists must still be scrutinized and held to account.\n\n>**TERFs are not conservative. There are conservative transphobes, but TERFs are by definition and have always been politically liberal.**\n\n>Many of you are young and have only known the term \u2018TERF\u2019 as associated with J.K. Rowling, Posie Parker, and other prominent women who are classical liberals and who have recently started appealing to the transphobia among conservatives to galvanize support for their cause. These are NOT historical TERFs, but are politically classical liberal, non-academic lay people that have only recently adopted TERF talking points.\n\n>TERFs emerged as Second Wave Radical Feminists with a specific focus on trans people in the late 1970s and grew in predominance through the 1990s, with Janice Raymond\u2019s *Transsexual Empire* and later J. Michael Bailey\u2019s *The Man Who Would Be Queen*.\n\n>\u201cTERF\u201d was a term coined by TERFs for TERFs. When intersectional feminism and womanism called them out on their bio-essentialism, they re-branded as \u201cGender Critical\u201d, and made a push starting in the 2000s with the advent of wide, publicly available internet access to make appeal to young girls and women with the term \u201cradfem\u201d\u2014which has been very successful for them, as evidenced by the many young trans women and non-binary people even here who don\u2019t know what historical Radical Feminism actually is, think \u201cradical feminism\u201d is a good thing, and even adopt radfem ideology on a surface level without really understanding it.\n\n>J.K. Rowling isn\u2019t a TERF, she is a lay \u2018liberal\u2019 (in the classical liberal sense) who has been radicalized by TERFs. Rowling and many like her have become a popular face for TERF talking points, but she and they are not the progenitors of TERF/GC/Radfem ideology, but products of it.\n\n>This bears repeating: \u2018Feminism\u2019 isn\u2019t an idea, it is a movement composed of people, and that movement developed from various historical roots, was always diverse and never uni-vocal, and has since developed and still is developing in many disparate streams. There is no such thing as a \u2018true feminist\u2019 or \u2018actual feminism\u2019;  rather, there are many streams of feminist thought, ideology, and political orientations. Some of those streams are deeply rooted in bio-essentialism that goes all the way back to the First Wave. TERFs are not new, and they are not and never have been politically conservative or right wing. Popular contemporary classical liberal figures radicalized (\u201cpeaked\u201d, as they call it) by TERFs are not the academics and activists who radicalized them and do not define the movement.\n\n>Feminism is not a monolithic concept that is \u2018good\u2019 in opposition to the \u2018bad\u2019, but a complex, striated movement among people with various ideological, philosophical, and political positions. Feminism itself must still always be examined, critiqued, and held to account. Intersectional Feminism is what will move us forward.

Males are corrupted mutants (the y chromosome is a mutilated x chromosome, you see, one of the deep reasons for the chromosome obsession) who have 'necrophilic' energy which drains the 'biophilic' energy of females.

She's a far-right reactionary.\n\n>\u201cTERF\u201d was a term coined by TERFs for TERFs.\n\nI'm fairly positive the term TERF was coined by Viv Smythe, who selected the label as a way to differentiate between trans inclusive and trans exclusive radical feminists.

            "I think you misunderstood my point too.\n\n\nI don't mean that there aren't feminists in the CG movement - or that TERFs lost their feminism - but that the CG movement is no longer a feminist one in the way that the TERF movement was only a short while ago. It is self admittedly a big tend with both feminists and non-feminists - and while it has some broadly feminist talking points, it isn't committted to any broader feminist ideology.\n\n\nHence how you can have J.K (who I think considers herself a feminist, but not really a radfem) and Posie Parker (who doesn't consider herself a feminist) at the head of the movement.",

Like those dark sci-fi movies where everyone dress and act the same\n\nI\u2019m definitely all for gender non-conformity, and full acceptance of all expressions no matter where they fall on the gender spectrum, but getting rid of the spectrum altogether would give me no way of actually expressing my gender.

            "Fair! I guess what I was trying to say is that I would like to abolish all these harmful gendered expectations, if that makes sense? Like, for example: men have to be strong and cannot show emotion. I struggle immensely with this as a trans man, and I imagine many cis men suffer subconsciously from this as well, because there's this expectation to be emotionally rigid to the point of repression. Again, there's nothing wrong with traditional masculinity or feminity, per se, but I do think men should be able to feel fully and to express their feelings without fear of social stigma. Am I making sense xD ?",
