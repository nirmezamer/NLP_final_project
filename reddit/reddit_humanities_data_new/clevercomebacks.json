Could you link me to your sources?\n\nAs to why the \u00abcomeback\u00bb in question is incorrect, I don\u2019t know what the other commenter was hinting at, but I can try to explain it myself:\n\nGod didn\u2019t \u00abcancel\u00bb two people because they ate from a fruit, it was only a separation between God and mankind (not a \u00abcancellation\u00bb). In fact, God didn\u2019t even want this separation. This is made clear throughout the rest of the Bible, and is in fact the reason that NT even exists. When you read the rest of the Bible, you\u2019ll see that God actually does almost anything to rectify the \u00abmistake\u00bb of Adam and Eve eating from the fruit.\n\nAs to why them eating from the fruit created such a separation? In layman\u2019s terms, it\u2019s pretty simple. God is pure. God cannot endure sin (in this context, let\u2019s define sin as \u00aban act that\u2019s against God\u2019s word\u00bb). When God asks Adam and Eve to not eat said fruit, and they still do, they\u2019ve commited a sin. Because God is pure, it is impossible for God to have any direct contact with Adam and Eve anymore. This is what creates this separation. As mentioned earlier, God doesn\u2019t want this separation, and does what He can to rectify it.\n\nHope that clears up any confusion :-)\nI\u2019d be happy to answer any questions you may have.

Just replacing the word \u201ccancelation\u201d with something else doesn\u2019t refute the spirit of the sentiment here. I know you know that. Adam was cursed to toil, they were given mortality for their disobedience, and the \u201cseparation\u201d, however you would like to phrase or describe it, is what they mean by cancelation. This was the birth of original sin for mankind. Acting like you can\u2019t comprehend what they mean or what we\u2019re talking about, and just getting extra words on the screen, describing exactly what they\u2019re talking about, isn\u2019t a refutation to the point being made here. You\u2019re being obtuse and masturbatory. \n\n\u201cGod didn\u2019t literally cancel them the way we use the word exactly in modern day. They didn\u2019t get fired from their jobs and flamed on the internet. So there. Obviously he just cursed them and punished the rest of mankind for eternity\u201d \u201cgod didn\u2019t cancel them. Here is a long diatribe that is essentially a synonym for cancel in this context\u201d lol jesus dude stop it this is insane \n\n> As to why them eating from the fruit created such a separation? In layman\u2019s terms, it\u2019s pretty simple. God is pure. God cannot endure sin (in this context, let\u2019s define sin as \u00aban act that\u2019s against God\u2019s word\u00bb). When God asks Adam and Eve to not eat said fruit, and they still do, they\u2019ve commited a sin. Because God is pure, it is impossible for God to have any direct contact with Adam and Eve anymore. This is what creates this separation. As mentioned earlier, God doesn\u2019t want this separation, and does what He can to rectify it.\n\n\nRefer to previous paragraph. Holy shit dude what are you doing \n\n> Hope that clears up any confusion :-) I\u2019d be happy to answer any questions you may have. Cheers!\n\nI haven\u2019t cringed this hard in a while.

This is human nature, it's something one needs to learn to overcome when studying really any text, be it a religious text or not, so this is not necessarily a criticism of your comment.\n\nIn this story, yes, what the daughters of Lot did was not in accordance with God's law. If you read the story, you can hear the daughters justifying their actions by saying (forgive my bad translation from my native language to english): \"And then Lot came out of Segor and lived on that mountain, and both of his daughters with him, because they feared to live in Segor. And he lived with both his daughters in a cave. And one daughter said to another: Our father is already old, and \\*there is not a man on earth, that is around here to give us children\\* as is the custom all over the earth. Let's get our father drunk with wine, so that we may keep his seed.\n\nAs you can see, this was not God commanding the daughters to have intercourse with their father, it was their own free will. That doesn't mean it's good. When you murder someone because you think you're doing good to the world, that doesn't mean that that action is good.\n\n>Absolutely unimaginable why an all-powerful being thought it necessary to degrade one of his prophets this way and tell us the story.\n\nNot sure what prophets you're talking about\n\n>The mental gymnastics Christians have to perform to be able to read their Bible without throwing it out the window is crazy to me.\n\nYes, religion and philosophy alike are not easy subjects.

Why did Sodom and Gomorrah become destroyed because of \"sexual immorality\", but when Lot's daughters get their grieving father drunk and rape him, those children get to become kings?\n\nSo you say that being a king is somehow magically a \"good\" thing, like, why is that a good thing on your world view? And even if thats somehow \"good\" or you see it as a \"reward\", you would have to take into account that there aren't that many kings/leaders in history that were good in God's sight. King solomon in the old testament was at first wise and good, but then sexual sin got to him and he became wicked. If God had to condemn anyone for anything bad they do in their life, he would have to do another flood, but he speciffically said he won't do that anymore.\n\n>And let's not forget when Moses attacked the Midianites (Numbers 31). 15,000 soldiers got to divide 32,000 virgin \"women children\" as the spoils of war, a war that was fought in part because of the \"sexual immorality\" of the Midianite women, with the little girls being taken as revenge. Nothing happened to Moses or his soldiers. That's pedophilia being allowed in the bible.\n\nok i dont remember entire numbers right now, but yeah bad things happen in wars, and in wars people go haywire. In the crusades the crusaders raped women even though they said they are faithful to the covenant. That doesnt mean that any of that was okay.

That passage refers to the time when the Israel came back from the war against Balak and brought black the people mentioned. But it was a war of Vengeance, because of the death of the Israel a few chapters prior. Thus Moise was angry when they didn't bring utter destruction to the land of Moab.",

It's about time that this myth of dresses being modest be revealed as just as flimsy as said dresses blowing in the wind. \n\nIf you ask me, *dresses and skirts* sexualize the wearer. \n\nTake a skirt, for example. A skirt just creates an open \"hole\" around the legs that you can imagine reaching up. \nThink of women dancing the can can or that famous picture of Marylin Monroe with an air vent blowing up her skirt. \n\nNot like pants, which preserves the shape of the human body while creating the impression that said shape has no genitalia and you can't even imagine reaching said genitalia without the garment essentially being removed.\n\nNow, a long and sweeping dress . . . yes. \n\nBecause sex is also about touching and intimacy, and what could makes someone's personal space feel more intimate than a dress that sweeps and brushes anything that comes close enough, with rippling folds that your hand can disappear right into as it envelops you. With a dress, the entire length of someone's body below the waist can give the subconscious impression of being a \"hole\" or something you can nestle/cuddle into as it wraps around part of your body. \n\nEverything can be sexual. Because sexuality is in the dirty mind of the beholder. If I see some Islamic extremist in a robe at one of those ISIS training camps on one knee with a big gun nestled near his crotch, in some part of my mind he is fucking that gun. \n\nI don't find pants sexual at all.

            "This sounds like you are going to send me a pic, please refrain from doing so.",
            "I definitely also worry that making people think they need to censor words like period and suicide is going to do some real harm for people\u2019s ability and willingness to talk about important things that need to be talked about. That has a real ugly 1984 feel, and the fact that it\u2019d all be due to some dumb company\u2019s policy is even more disheartening.\u00a0",
            "Not the entirety of gen z is on Tik tok, nor are they the only generation on it, and nor does everyone on Tik tok censor words, so I think your fear is a complete non issue",
            "I wrote specifically that I didn\u2019t share the views of the original poster. \n\nYeah, good for you. You have internalized the zeitgeist to the comma and aren\u2019t able to have a thought of your own.",
            "Btw who said there wasn\u2019t free agency? I didn\u2019t even talk about that. \n\nBut since you brought it up: how far is that free agency of yours supposed to go? Indecent exposure doesn\u2019t exist for you at all or does it only apply to men? \n\nJust to understand the boundaries you\u2018re setting here for me. (Even if you didn\u2019t understand what I was saying and probably won\u2019t understand my reply, should there be one.)",
            "Still it doesn't make the comeback clever.",
            "Hahahah \u201cdon\u2019t yuck my yum\u201d",
            ">Don't yuck my yum.\n\nThis is my motto! I said it twice earlier today!",
            "TBF, if you sort by Top even the 7-10 year old posts are like that.",
            "I think they think a bodycon or bandage dress is a sundress. That\u2019s like the complete opposite.",
            "It really is.",

            "If you had sex with a new partner everyday for 8 years you're up to about 2920, just to give perspective.\n\nSeems a bit extreme.",
            "I'm a little into triple digits and 3000 seems completely impossible if you're not like, doing it for work. I'm in the lifestyle and even the most long-term, active swingers I know can't touch that.\n\nSeriously, when the fuck did he work?",

            "Eh that\u2019s kinda my fault - I\u2019m the one started with the sweeping statement about \u201ca generation growing up on TikTok\u201d and that\u2019s an overly broad generalization and I know it.\u00a0\n\nHowever, the overly-cautious censoring phenomenon is more widespread among TikTok users than people who primarily use other platforms, and the user base of TikTok skews more gen Z / alpha than older generations compared to other social media platforms, so - as best as I can tell - the overly-cautious censoring phenomenon is probably more widespread among younger people than older ones. I was just trying to write that in a shorthand way.\n\nAnd nobody needs to internalize a habit or be surrounded by a zeitgeist that makes it look or feel like periods, sex,\u00a0or suicide are things you shouldn\u2019t talk about, but I\u2019d wish that pattern on younger people least of all. They\u2019d probably benefit from being encouraged to talk freely about that stuff more than most people would.\u00a0",
            "Wow, you really want to sound smart...but you have to actually say smart things, not just string words together and pray nobody notices. Oof.",
            "I'll reply to this garbled mess as well. You conflated sexualization with feminism, both accepting the premise that pants are more than pants, and that feminism is about anything other than letting women dress themselves.\n\nThe funniest thing is that you truly are not following any of this, while both thinking you are a genius and chastising me for not having original thought. Why not just call me an \"NPC\"? Because it's a lot shorter than \"internalized the zeitgeist\", sounds a lot less ridiculous, and it's obviously what you meant.  I am choking on the irony.\n\nOK. I need to stop engaging with mental illness on the internet. Sorry bro. Muting replies, have a good one.",
            "It's almost like I was responding to the absurd idea that OP is getting attacked for merely saying something \"more conservative than Karl Marx\", when he literally sounds like somebody who would happily stone women for showing a bare ankle.\n\nThe insult is weak, but it didn't happen because of an anti-Woke Marxist crusader. It happened because OP guy is gross as hell.",
            "Weird, I said it twice yesterday!",
