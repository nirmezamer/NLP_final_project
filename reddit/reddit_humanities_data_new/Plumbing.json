Live in a single story house with a crawl space where I put two heaters and turned the main water valve off.  I\u2019m just wondering how long it normally takes I have had the heaters going for about 3 hours and still nothing has changed I felt the copper pipes and thought I found where the freeze was but nothing has moved.  When should I expect some movement?",

            "Have been trying to be proactive to avoid pipes freezing but unfortunately I think our hot water to kitchen sink has (no water comes out when set to hot) in spite of keeping on a (cold water) drip all night. Cold water comes through fine. I tried to run dishwasher and while it heats up I also don't think hot water is going to it either.\n\nHot water and cold water works everywhere else in the house including clothes washer. I've tried turning hot water to all the faucets/showerheads and placed a space heater directly pointed at the kitchen sink cabinet to warm things up, but getting nothing. Basement, utility room and crawl space are all at good ambient temp. I suspect a part of the water line on the perimeter of the house froze (as it faces an open field where we've been getting really cold wind). We have copper.\n\nSo the issue is I travel tomorrow and I'm at a loss what to do. It's supposed to dramatically warm up here over the coming days and I fear coming back to a mess. Should I turn off the water main before traveling? I haven't done that before, would i just turn the valve off and drain all the water from the faucets?",

Called a local plumber, they gave me some tips and told me to wait it out. We kept the house hot, wrapped an electric blanket around the mains and opened the taps a little. Husband turned off the mains while we slept overnight, turned them back on this morning, heard a clunk as an ice chunk flowed through and, alleluia!, water is flowing! Hot and cold both are working as normal in all sinks and tubs, toilets are flushing (thank goodness, we were melting snow to fill the tanks!) and we can't see any evidence of obvious leaks in the walls, basement or outdoors. We've had a single tap going for about an hour now just to keep water moving.\n\nI guess my question is ... are we good? I'm dying for a shower and have a dishwasher full of dirty dishes I'd love to get done. I tried to call the plumbing office for advice but they're closed until Monday (understandable). I think I will call them Monday and see if I can have someone come out, though I don't know what they'd be looking for.",

Over night I left a thermometer in each cupboard; one reached 32\u00b0F the other 22\u00b0F so it seems like a safe bet that the wall is not insulated.

The other bathrooms and appliances are all getting water no problem.\n\nOne tenant used a hairdryer to thaw the drain and now they are \u201cfine\u201d but the other side is still not draining even with the help of a hairdryer and the connections are starting to drip after the p-trap before the wall.\n\nMy take away is that I need to insulate the walls in the cabinets to prevent the drain from freezing in the future but I\u2019m not sure what caused the cold water line to stop, assuming it froze but I\u2019m not sure where since it\u2019s a slab house.\n\nMy temporary solution is space heaters in the kitchen with the cabinets left open.\n\nHow would you handle this?

I've always just turned off my basement main and ran my fixtures dry and so on, just to play it safe in the event i lose power and/or get stranded at work.

            "Not a plumber. Live in the northeast, it dropped down to negatives two nights ago and it's just now getting above freezing.\n\nMaster bedroom and bath are upstairs. I have two outdoor hose spigots and I only remembered to turn off the line for one of them. The other is in the corner of my basement near where I expect the lines run up to the master bathroom. I'm not sure if the hose line freezing contributed to the issues but I expect it probably played a role.\n\nAll faucets in the house were running both hot and cold water fine except the master shower and the cold water line for one of our double vanities. Kind of weird, but okay. It's all flexible lines and a new build, so I wasn't too worried about bursting but valves are a possibility. The lines either run up the outer wall by the garage or through the ceiling of the garage. They aren't exposed, but the garage isn't heated so that could also probably a contributing factor.\n\nAnyway, the single cold water line was totally frozen and the shower was trickling. I turned the shower on but kept it to cold to keep water running through the line. I also turned every faucet and shower on in the house to just a light trickle to keep as much movement in the water lines as I could. Then I cranked up my heat to 80. After about 2.5 hours the shower was showing clear pipe and full function. The cold line to the sink was fully blocked so it didn't come on right away but that line and the shower line must be very close or connected because it started flowing a couple minutes after the shower was good.\n\nSo if you don't have to worry about broken pipes and water damage, keeping the water running and turning your heat up can definitely help to clear some pipes some of the time, even if you can't access or find the specific frozen part.\n\nGood luck out there, and don't forget to take precautions!",

            "bathroom addition over an unheated, and inaccessible, crawl space in an old home that we recently purchased.  Had -26F (-32C) overnight.  Had sink and tub taps running, but didn't have the toilet running at all (didn't think of a good approach to that until after the fact ... and also realized after the fact that I could/should have just drained the water from that bathroom entirely ... will know better next time).\n\nToilet supply is frozen, with no access to the line once it leaves basement on way to addition.  Figured out a way to run hot water through the cold water line to the addition and it flows well to sink/tub, and have been hoping it will help thaw the frozen toilet supply line.  Have also been directing hairdryer at the stub of waterline where it enters the wall.  And, have a spaceheater up fairly high in the space.  No luck after hours of this.

They have a copper water supply pipe that goes from inside the building, to outside to a water chiller unit for the HVAC system. \n\nDespite the pipe being insulated it still froze and broke. \n\nNow I replaced the break in the pipe and at the closest part you the part that goes into the building I installed a 3 way connecting to a ball valve to drain out the pipe.\n\nNow to further describe there's about 6 inches of pipe coming out from the building, then the ball valve, then about another 6 inches above going to a 90 degree elbow. It goes over 5 feet, then another 90 degree elbow and up about 4 or 5 feet and one final elbow going into the machine. So with about 10ft of pipe that would be empty, should I be concerned about the part of the pipe that goes into the building freezing and causing a break?\n\nMy thought was the ice would take the path of least resistance and just fill in the empty space which while ice expands I don't think it could expand from 6 inches outside through 10ft of pipe.\n\nDo I make sense though or am I crazy?

            "I've received some conflicting input and I'm trying to resolve it:\n\nIn this case we're talking about an interior kitchen sink on an exterior wall. My understanding is that in freezing weather, one should leave their faucets slightly open to allow water flow as flowing water is less likely to freeze, and the water flow brings up warmer water into the potential freeze zone.\n\n**The issue here is when the pipe has already frozen.**\u00a0All my life I've thought you just left the faucet slightly ajar.\u00a0*I've recently been told that doing so is actually more harmful due to some explanation of air pressure. If a faucet is closed on an already frozen pipe, it should actually be kept closed to prevent bursting.*\n\nIs this advice valid, and does anyone know where it comes from? My cursory internet search seems to indicate most everyone agrees on treatment of pipes that aren't yet frozen, but the answer is less clear on pipes that have already frozen.

            "Who is right and who is wrong\n\nHousemate/owner of home left yesterday/today for work, came back tonight. Day before leaving wrapped outside pipes(front/back gardenhose pipe) and opened cabinet doors under sinks in kitchen/bathroom.\n\nThey leave for work, I stay at home in case we lose electricity/water pressure. Freeze comes, we never lose power, we never lose water pressure. At some point the next day they call me end of the world 'someone in the neighborhood/down the street lost water pressure run and cut the water main off by the street.' Meanwhile we have water pressure. We have electricity. 'Sure okay whatever' after all that, I finally inform them, for the third time, we still have both water and electricity. They respond good.\n\nCome back tonight. 'When did you turn water back on?' 'Never turned it off, we had electricity/power constantly. Central Heat on 24/7 in the house.'\n\nIncoming conniption fit 'omg I can't believe you I TOLD you to cut the water off' 'I told you we had power and water pressure the whole time why would I cut it off' etc etc blah blah back and forth.\n\nShe's convinced we won't know for days/weeks if the pipes in the attic are broke or not(see: the pipes that still have water pressure and have had for days and are inside the roof of a house being heated by central heat, with faucets open and dripping 24/7), and also claims the outside pipes(front/back yard) were in danger despite being wrapped.\n\nWho is right, and who is wrong, with reasoning.\n\nMy argument, 'If you c ared that much you would have turned off the water entirely before you left.' 'We never lost power/heat/water pressure'\n\nHer argument, 'None of that matters, you should have unwrapped the wrapped pipes, turned the water off and drained them.'\n\nMaybe this question is petty but fuck me if I can't wrap my head around their side at all. Attic pipes should be fine with house heated at 70 24/7, other pipes should have been fine because they were 1) wrapped, and 2) any remaining water would have(in theory) been drained out of those pipes regardless from toilet flushing as the toilet pipes are lower than the outside pipes(?) which lowest pipes drain water out of closed higher pipes from what I understand.",

Place a submersible water pump in a five-gallon bucket of water.\n2. Attach 1/4-inch plastic ice maker tubing to the pump with the appropriate fitting.\n3. Attach a four-foot piece of flexible PEX tubing to the pipe in question.\n4. Feed the ice maker tubing into the PEX tubing until it reaches the blockage.\n5. Plug the pump into a GFCI outlet to pump a steady stream of water directly at the blockage. As the water hits the ice, it simply trickles back down the pipe and into the five-gallon bucket.\n6. Once the blockage is clear, pull the tubing back out, turn the main water supply back on, and you\u2019re back in business!",

A lot easier to get the water above 32\u00b0 when you're going from 20\u00b0 instead of 5\u00b0. \n\nPlease note that I'm not a plumber nor do have any technical training in this area, so this was mostly dumb luck. But maybe it could help someone else? Regardless, do what you can to stay safe and stay warm.",

The tankless was supposed to be able to detect low temps and heat itself to keep from freezing but so much for that.",

            "You'll be fine, heating the pipes isn't going to do anything to hurt the water heater. As long as there is power going to the TWH, you'll be okay- those Rinnai units have ceramic heaters inside the unit to help counteract freezing, and indoor units are rated to -20.",
            "It's tough to say but given that you have neighbors with a heat running, I imagine you're going to be able to keep the system above freezing temperatures even if yours is off",
            "Shut off the water main in your house and leave a faucet or two open to relieve any pressure in the system. If the system is frozen, there's nothing you can do beyond throw a space heater or two in the area and wait for the pipes to thaw before inspecting for damage",

            "Well, I've been pointing space heaters at the wall and my sink cabinet all day and still haven't thawed out the hot water line to my kitchen sink. Maybe that was too much to hope for; it was a high of 23 degrees today, with wind chill that took it down about another 10 degrees.\n\nTo avoid major damage while I sleep, I cut the intake to the hot water heater and drained some of the hot water from the lines. I've got the kitchen faucet set to drip both cold and hot (though only cold is dripping at the moment) and cracked open the hot water faucets in the other sinks in the house. I thought about shutting off the hot water heater, but it's only overnight, so I figure it will be fine.\n\nIt's supposed to get up to 35 degrees tomorrow, so maybe it'll thaw and there won't be a leak. That would be a Christmas miracle, for sure. Here's hoping that all those others of you with frozen pipes get your miracles, too.",
            "Merry Christmas! I thought I'd give a quick update, because I like it when other people give updates. The hot water pipe still has not thawed, though I have been running those space heaters for nearly 24 hours now. Based on where the lines run and where I can get to with my space heaters, I'm guessing that puts the freeze near an elbow, which increases my odds of a burst pipe when it thaws. Who knows, maybe I'll get lucky? I had the sink handle in between hot and cold and a slow drip when it froze, so maybe that relieved enough pressure.\n\nTemperature says a high of 34 today, so maybe it'll thaw. 38 tomorrow, if not. I turned the hot water back on for now, but I guess I'll be in the habit of turning it off whenever I leave the house or sleep until the pipe thaws.",
            ">GMabbo\n\nUpdate: the hot water line appears to be working again! Pressure seems good and I don't hear anything behind the wall. Looks good so far! Thanks, Christmas!\n\nI did have one thought. I have been periodically checking for leaks using an inspection camera on either side of the cabinet that stands in front of where I think the freeze was. However, if there is a leak, it's probably going to be directly behind the cabinet. Any thoughts on whether or not I should drill a small hole in the base of the cabinet so that I send my inspection camera through? Then I could check the floor and the bottom of the drywall below the potential leak. I think the head of the camera is only about a quarter of an inch, so it wouldn't have to be a big hole.\n\nI don't really know much about burst pipes, but is it possible that they create a slow leak and not a flood?",
            "Got lucky and blew a seal???  I don't know but it'll take need a eye and some mending for sure.",
            "Alpharetta Georgia here.\nI believe my main line is frozen too. No water at all. Plumber told me there\u2019s not much they can do and I\u2019ll just need to wait it out until the weather warms up.",
            "I'm not a plumber, but I'll say the obvious that you or your brother has probably already figured out. It sounds like there may be two problems. If hot water is running generally and cold is not, there is probably a freeze in the line after it feeds into the line that goes the hot water heater and before it starts branching out to various parts of the house. This is probably somewhere near the water cutoff. Just follow the line from the cutoff until it starts splitting into a bunch of other lines, figure out which goes to the water heater, then go from there. In my house, this is all fairly easy to see, but I can't say in your brother's. If this happens to be somewhere near where the hot line runs up to the upstairs sink, there's your likely target. Otherwise, there's probably a second freeze somewhere. Again, I'm not a plumber, but there are just so many unanswered questions here, so I thought that I would respond to at least one. Best of luck.",
            "Update to my situation. As soon as the sun hit the side of my house where the pipes are located, I set my house thermostat to 80 and ran a space heater in my bathroom and closed the door. Within 2 hours, the water began to flow.",
            "Well, turns out I was just being too cautious on the quarter turn shutoff valve. Put a little more finger leverage behind it and it closed easily enough.",
            "PEX is one of the best pipes you can have although they are not freeze proof. It does better because it can expand and contract to a degree. The problem with freezing in pipes is it exerts around 20,000 PSI and that\u2019s what causes breaks in water pipes during a freeze.",
            "We don't talk pricing here. If the pipe froze, you still have the issue that you had before he showed up. If you did nothing to address why the pipe froze, it's going to freeze again",
            "Open the wall and insulate the pipe or open the wall and run some heat trace along the pipe",
            "Just because you turned the water off and \"drained\" the lines doesnt mean you got all the water out. You'd be better off leaving a sink dripping. Most likely you had a spot that could t be gravity drained in the lines that froze",

            "Is the water supply running up through an exterior wall? I have the same thing happening but just with my cold water. It\u2019s frozen because a 3 foot section runs in the exterior wall. It\u2019s thankfully pex. I turned off the main water supply and drained the house of all water. I turned up the heat and will check tomorrow if it thawed. I\u2019m also in Colorado.

            "Similar situation here: Chicagoland, new homeowner, copper pipes, hot water is only semi-functional (full bathroom works, half bath and kitchen sink are no bueno). I spoke with a plumber who gave me a lot of what I think is good information:\n\n* his prediction is that tomorrow/Friday is D-day for him working busted pipes\u2014he said stuff usually starts thawing around here once the temperature is consistently above 10F\n* space heaters are fine, but hair dryers and heat guns are not\u2014he recommended gentle, gradual heating of pipes we're trying to thaw (so putting the house at a warmer temperature, opening cabinets & the crawlspace for circulation, that kind of thing)\n* leave the drains open for now to allow water and gas a route to escape\n* if we spot a leak, turn off the water at the main valve\u2014he recommended turning it off on the house-side (AFTER the meter) rather than the street-side (but either will do the trick!)\n* shut off the water main if we're both leaving the house (or if we just don't want to deal with monitoring & the stress)\n* for monitoring: obviously keep an eye on the open taps in case things resolve happily, otherwise keep an ear open for water running and this one is my current favorite stress tick\u2014check the water meter compulsively! Ours is right next to our crawlspace entry so I spent today working in a chair close to both and just looking over every once in awhile\n* so yeah, if things go south and we do discover there's a busted pipe, then TURN OFF THE WATER AT THE MAIN VALVE AND CALL A PLUMBER\n* extra stuff: I was worried about how that works since gas heater=bad vibes, but he said if we turn off the main water valve we don't need to do anything with the water heater since it works by displacement and not direct water pressure from the pipes\n* however, if we do turn off the water, we should also turn off the ice maker in our fridge!\n* we live in a 1-story, so we don't have to deal with draining water if we shut things down (it'll most likely flood our crawlspace, still vvvv bad obviously, but better than other scenarios), but if you live in a multi-story that's a consideration\n* to end on a happy note: he said the vast majority of pipes will thaw just fine, but if it does blow, just visualize your steps: main valve, fridge, call!\n* and a note from my mom who had a pipe burst 20 years ago: it will sound like your kids broke something a room over\n\nSo those are the notes I took from the call.

You may need to buy a pipe wrench too to remove the cut pipe connected to that red pipe  valve.. install the adapter to pex (solid to pex adapter). shut your water near your meter\u2026 by twisting it clockwise (form T shape to shut water).  Then cut the white pex where the red pipe crosses (path) - then insert the T connector then connect a new pex and connect it to the newly installed pipe adapter (red pipe).",
