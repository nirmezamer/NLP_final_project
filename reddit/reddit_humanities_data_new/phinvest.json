        "content": "# Welcome to PH Invest!\n\n**If you have no clue about investing and would like to learn:**\n\nPlease start by reading the [FAQ](https://reddit.com/r/phinvest/wiki/faq). It's written by awesome contributors of the sub. You can also try reading previous posts, particularly ones with the [\"Investment/Financial Advice\" flair](/r/phinvest/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Investment%2FFinancial%20Advice%22&restrict_sr=1). If you still want to ask questions, there's a sticky \"Random Discussion\" post and a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/AxFw5Pb). If you prefer to create a new post, it helps to add details like your current financial situation, your time horizon, your goals, etc., as much details you're comfortable sharing.\n\n**If you're interested in funds and would like to compare their performance:**\n\nThis [webpage](https://r-phinvest.github.io/returns.html) shows the returns of mutual funds and unit investment trust funds on each year as well as compound annual returns. You can click on the fund names to go to their PIFA or UITF web pages. You can also graph their historical returns. Try playing with it by adding other funds, indexes and other data sets so you can visually compare them. The returns are also available in a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12m0HBYB5dmVicUp9gHJ1tdSsMefaMYfWH2Mh1UIrAVc/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n**If you're interested in the financials of companies listed in The Philippine Stock Exchange:**\n\nI also maintain a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mj38XJrBChSAtK9vJNmrCjySV0EHbQClo-r6C8UQYfg/edit?usp=sharing) with quarterly and annual figures. I update all the data every weekend.\n\n**For other posters:**\n\nIf you're selling something, consider if it's more appropriate to post in a sub like r/phclassifieds. Here, at least create a substantial post about what you're selling that may spark a discussion. If it's just an ad, it'll be removed.\n\nPlease keep the posts relevant to investing in the Philippines or products and services readily available to Filipinos.\n\nThat's pretty much it. As long as Reddit's rules aren't violated, I'd rather not censor posts.\n\n# Good luck and happy investing!",

            "Just wanna share insights on living in Rizal.. I live in Cainta, Rizal along Ortigas extension and it was a pain in the ass to travel to Ortigas center when I used to work there. I quit on-site work last Feb due to exhaustion kasi kahit umalis ako ng 5am for a 6 or 7am shift, arrival on time for said shift is not guaranteed due to really terrible traffic. Going home, if I leave ng 4pm sa office 30 mins lang sya. Pero I used to have to offset my late arrival to work and minsan 430pm ako umalis, 1hr sure aabutin ko on the road unless schools are on break. Some areas din bahain, even the ones na mukhang fancy so you gotta do your due diligence in asking around sa residents if binabaha ba yung area na gusto nyo. Kung di bahain, malamang the routes you\u2019ll need to take on rainy days will be. Siguro look sa Antipolo/Tanay area para elevated pero that will put you further away from the business districts.",

But if you said you both work in NCR, it\u2019s just not practical to move to a home that would require you long commutes to work, especially with our traffic situation here. Spare yourselves from that stress. Well, going to Makati from Cavite, for example, is much better now than when coming from Pasay, as a commuter. :) But going to Ortigas is a different story.\n\nBuying a property in NCR, if you can, as it would be much more expensive, might be a better option for you.

Buying their own property talaga was possible but would put us in a very very tight spot. Ayaw nila ma forsake education namin. \n\nWhen we finished studying, they suddenly had lots of money to spare. Dito sila naging matapang and started buying properties in QC and provinces. They are confident na to loan in banks and focus their income sa properties kasi wala na kami sa equation haha. Ang dali pa nila nakaka kuha ng loans na may magandang terms kasi they were (and still) smart with their money when they were still a young couple. \n\nMy point is, don't pressure yourselves into buying a house. Buying one entails a large sum of money and would oblige you to maintain this. Kahit na hindi sa amin yung bahay na nirerentahan, pinapaganda ng parents ko, pininturahan nila and made the garden pretty. Even though it wasn't ours, it was HOME. Hindi namin naisip na malungkot na bagay yon yung hindi sa amin yung tinitirahan namin, kasi ginawa naman naming masaya yung bahay. \n\nThe perfect time will come. Kapag confident na kayo and alam mong may extra kayo in case of anything, mafi-feel nyo yan and makakabili din kayo ng property. \n\nWala naman po masama sa renting. Wag kayo ma pressure sa socmed.

There is no easy way around it but get tied up with huge loans for the rest of your productive life just to own a 150sqm property. That's how wide the gap between the so-called middle class and the rich. \n\nLand is the most reliable in terms of assets to see growth in the medium and long term. Sadly the ordinary workers will not be part of this if they don't inherit land (of value) from their parents in the first place. Hope is thin for this generation unfortunately unless you're amongst the lucky few who earn a couple hundred grand a month and can afford to buy with little effort. \n\nThe only good news is you can buy land now and let your children inherit it so that they will not be in the same predicament as you are now. From hereon my only interest in acquiring additional land is no longer for myself but for my kids.",
