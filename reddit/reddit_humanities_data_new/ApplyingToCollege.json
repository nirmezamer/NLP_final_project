",

        "comments": [
            "Relax. College juniors can't get internships. The idea that you would is a little silly. Just go lifeguard somewhere and have a good summer.",
            "You do not 'need to round out' your application--colleges do not expect you to do a milion things, and in fact throwing a bunch of ECs at the wall to look good is incredibly obvious to AOs and makes it difficult to see what you \\*actually care about\\* and will bring to your college class.\n\nAOs want a balanced \\*class\\* not balanced individuals--they want individuals who have a passion they've excelled in and bring something interesting to the class.\n\nI'd focus much more on taking what you're already involved in and making sure you are an active participant--are there more responsibilities you can take on? a leadership position? \n\nCome application time, it's much more important that you can show how you made a difference in the things you do--whether that's what you list on your resume or your ability to describe problems you tackled in your supplemental essays--then another line item that an AO can't make heads or tails of if you actually made a meaningful contribution.",
            "It's great to see all the diverse activities you're involved in! Since you have a startup invited to a national showcase, you could highlight this experience on your college applications as it demonstrates entrepreneurship and initiative. Additionally, consider reaching out to local businesses or organizations for short-term internships or volunteer opportunities. Even if it's late in the summer, I think there are still good chances to get something. Good luck!",
            "First off, props on the startup gig - thats awesome and is definitely gonna impress admissions. Make sure u milk that for all its worth in your essays.\n\nAs for finding more opps, its never too late to reach out. Heres what Id do:\n\n1. Hit up profs at local colleges/unis. Theyre always lookin for extra hands in the lab, even if its not a formal internship. Shoot them an email introducing urself and express ur interest in their work. Worst they can say is no.\n2. Tap into ur network. Talk to fam, friends, mentors - anyone who might have connections in fields ur interested in. U never know what doors they could open.\n3. Get creative with self-driven projects. Start a blog, build an app, conduct ur own research. Admissions loves seeing initiative and passion.\n\nGood luck and let me know if you have any questions!",
            "Please don\u2019t stress. Colleges do like to see that you are busy, active, and benefitting from some kind of growth, new experience, or challenge.  But that experience or challenge need not involve academic or pre-professional activities.  One option is to lean into and complement activities you already enjoy.  You are a soccer referee, so perhaps you could look into being an assistant coach for a youth team.  You volunteer for a local religious organization, but perhaps you\u2019d also enjoy tutoring underprivileged kids, socializing shelter pups, or teaching seniors how to engage on social media.   In terms of academics, you could sign up for a summer online class that aligns with your current interests. \n\nOr you could seek out some new experiences and interests. Get a PT job working retail, food services, or the like and demonstrate your soft skills.  Seek out a new hobby by taking classes at an indoor climbing gym, learn to play the guitar, or try improv or sketch comedy.  Join a summer sports league.  Or take an online class that you feel you might enjoy but that doesn\u2019t reflect your current academic pursuits: film studies, short story writing, or political theory and the MCU. \n\nYou have many options. Enjoy!",

You're doing interesting and creative things.

            "based on what you are interested in, there's this new organization that's starting this summer that sounds rly good for you and you could reach out to them even for this summer for like an internship during development stages or start a chapter yourself for leadership, i have a bunch of friends kind of similar to you that are starting chapters. it's a business based organization, and there's a bunch of programs within it but from what i understood one program specifcially assigns a small business to a chapter or an indiviudal or a group and hten based on this curriculum that they have you grow the small business over the course of a year, another one is about teaching digital literacy and financial literacy to like underpriveleged and elementary schools: not to ramble, but overall seems like a good extracurricualr to highlight your passion and more importantly, impact on community.",
            "Do some online courses if you have to. Some colleges take those certificates. But you do a lot already. I did much less when I applied and got into berkeley",
            "don't sweat it! Startups & ref job are cool! Summer programs might be tight, but research? Reach out to local profs ASAP, see if they need a summer research assistant",
            "Students underestimate the impact of a summer job! Admissions officers know that jobs teach important skills: responsibility, interpersonal skills, problem-solving, partnering with others, thinking on your feet, resilience, punctuality....Doesn't have to be a \"fancy\" job. A former student worked at Dunkin' and it taught him a lot - and he got a great essay out of the experience ;)",
            "This is going to sound patronizing or dumb, but honestly, colleges are way more impressed if you go out of your way to create your own opportunities. I work with students and most don't get internships unless their parent works in the place. I get the kids I work with to think about the things they love, and combine it with whatever they are good at. Your interest in Soccer means you could complete a passion project that combines soccer with things you are good at. This doesn't need to be the most successful thing in the world either. I had a student plan and host a volleyball tournament for girls to promote the sport in her area - They LOVED it, and it didn't hurt her CV either.",

            "Hi! I used to intern at SparkPrintz, a custom-apparel start-up company, and I thought it helped me with my resume. I did sales & marketing and it was a paid remote position. I highly recommend because I feel like i learned a lot even though I didn't come from a business background, and I'm telling my younger friends to do it now that I'm in college. I recommend checking their website ASAP since they are recruiting summer interns.\n\nGood luck! This summer wouldn't be make a break; just make sure to take care of yourself",
            "As someone going to Stanford this year to major in CS, I can assure you you don't need to stress about doing 15 million extracurriculars. I basically just worked and volunteered last summer.",

            "i read through your post, and noticed how much you valued seeing unique extracurricular activities over impressive yet common activities. a question that i would like to ask is how exactly you can verify these activities and how you measure impact. aside from doing these activities that have been detailed in my post above, i have many generic ecs but a couple of unique ones too, specifically an art hobby that i started. how exactly can you measure this success and dedication when a student is submitting an activity that is so unique? quoting your post, you can easily verify whether a student was a debate champion or a top varsity tennis player, but how could you tell if they transposed metal songs on a ukelele, and further measure the impact that that activity has had on their community?",

I hosted one last summer that raised over $300 before even imagining it on my college application, and I would love to host another not as part of a specific organization or nonprofit but rather just for fun to promote the sport and raise awareness. thoughts?",

What you have to remember is that AO's are looking for something that shows you are forward thinking and are going to contribute to their school in a positive way, this kind of thing can help show that. If you're really struggling to list your achievements maybe look at talking to a college admissions consultant to help you figure out what you have already and what you could add to your academic CV. \n\nIf you want one piece of free advice from a college admissions consultant its this: \n\nMake sure you can REALLY link why it was great that YOU specifically did this. Talk about what skills you brought to the event, and what you got to work on, and explain why that was so important. \n\nAt the end of the day, there are only so many NASA internships, so the school isn't going to reject you for that, if they did, they would only admit like 20 students a year!",

Not all of these land-grant schools are \u201c___ state;\u201d this is how UWisconsin was founded, and Delaware used the funds to designate UDel their land-grant school to essentially resuscitate it from financial downfall. But other schools, like (the) Ohio State, Michigan State, and Penn State were named that way because, well, Ohio University, UMich, and UPenn already existed. \n\nIt\u2019s also how a lot of HBCUs were founded, especially in the 1890s! Morrill Act of 1890 specifically targeted southern states to either show that race was not a factor in admission to land-grant universities or to establish a separate land-grant school for Black/African-American students.

If you are really feeling shitty, do what many people do, including myself, and turn down the damn school to go to community college, then transfer to Harvard. Easy Peasy. \n\n\"now I'm going to continue to waste their money over the next four years and continue to disappoint them.\"\n\nGet over yourself.",
            "Ok, let's talk PERSPECTIVE.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nI wrote the book on disappointing my parents regarding college admissions. I REALLY wanted to go to Yale or Brown, and as an undergraduate, I got wait-listed, deferred and rejected by both Universities. I just wasn't \"Ivy League ready\" yet as an undergraduate.\u00a0 I instead went to my first-choice college: Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0My parents were graduates of Columbia and The University of Chicago, and they were COMPLETELY baffled and confused by my choice. They felt I was making a critical mistake by choosing Hampshire. They would have been happier had I chosen Sarah Lawrence, Bard, Bennington or NYU, which were some of my other choices. However, I WOULDN'T have been at all happy if I'd chosen to attend those schools.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd don't get me wrong: I \u2764\ufe0f'd Sarah\u00a0 Lawrence & Bard; I liked NYU (I'd gotten into Tisch & Gallatin) but none of those places were like Hampshire. Bennington came the closest to being most like it, but I just personally overall preferred Hampshire. It just \"fit me\" as an individual.\u00a0\n\n\nI think what you have to ask yourself is: \"What do you REALLY want?\" NOT even factoring in what your parents want. It's YOUR choice. True, they are footing the bill, and I get that, BUT you're the one who's attending, NOT your parents. YOU have to be happy where you choose to go.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0That's the choice I made -- despite what my parents thought, I HAD to choose for myself where I'd be happiest attending college; and I was fortunate enough to get a couple of Scholarships and Hampshire gave me a decent financial aid package.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThey eventually got more on board when they realized that Hampshire was part of the Five College Consortium, so I'd also be taking courses at Amherst, Smith & Mt. Holyoke Colleges & the University of Massachusetts/Amherst, which are all highly prestigious institutions that are WELL-KNOWN within the Ivy League.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0They were also impressed by Hampshire graduates graduate school entrance stats. And so, they realized what I was doing. I was using the Consortium to gain admittance to Yale & Brown for graduate school + I was attending my first choice college so I'd also be happy while I was pursuing that.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTherefore, that increased their understanding of what I was doing, and they let the issue go. It wasn't easy at first, they were EXTREMELY skeptical about Hampshire as my top choice and they thought I would NEVER be able to achieve the kind of professional career or have access to excellent professional resources (which wasn't true, Hampshire has good resources) coming from an \"alternative\" small liberal arts college, even though the Academic Programs I was studying in there were small (as it's a small college), they were still also EXCELLENT programs.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd I did reapply to Yale & Brown for graduate school, and I got into BOTH this time. And I went to Yale for my MFA. ANYTHING can be possible if YOU want it to be. Your parents ultimately won't be living YOUR life either, so you have to chart your own course in life, and making the right college choice for YOURSELF is what starts you on that journey.\u00a0\n\n\nBest of luck. \ud83d\udc4d",
