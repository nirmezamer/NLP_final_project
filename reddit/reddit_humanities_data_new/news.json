            "\"A shooting outside a grocery store in\u00a0[Fordyce, Arkansas](https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/arkansas), on Friday around 11:30 a.m., left three people dead and eight others wounded, Arkansas State Police Secretary of Public Safety and Director Mike Hagar said in a Friday afternoon press conference.\u00a0 Two law enforcement officers were among the wounded, but their wounds are non-life-threatening, Hager said.\u00a0\n\n[The shooter is in custody](https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime)\u00a0after exchanging gunfire with state police.\u00a0\n\nHager said the victims' wounds range from non-life-threatening to critical.\u00a0\n\n\"It\u2019s tragic, our hearts are broken,\" Hager told reporters.\u00a0\n\nA witness, who works at Holt Builder's Supply across the street from the shooting at the Mad Butcher grocery store, told Fox News Digital he heard \"several rounds\" and saw victims being medevaced from the scene.\u00a0  \nThe employee said, \"multiple agencies were down here trying to figure out what was going on. We saw policemen running around the pharmacy, which is right next door to the Mad Butcher.\"\n\nHe added, \"It was pretty hectic around here between 11:30 and noon\" and that he saw a medevac land at the local hospital's helipad.\u00a0\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee-Sanders said on social media that she had been \"briefed on the tragic shooting in Fordyce, and I\u2019m in constant contact with State Police at the scene. I am thankful to law enforcement and first responders for their quick and heroic action to save lives. My prayers are with the victims and all those impacted by this horrific incident.\"\n\nA witness named Odis Allen told FOX 16 he has lived in Fordyce for 60 years and was completely \"shocked\" by the shooting.\u00a0\n\n\"I never saw something like this happen in Fordyce, Arkansas,\" he told the station, adding he was scared for his children and grandchildren.\u00a0\n\nAnother witness told FOX 16 that the shooter had \"destroyed a community today.\"\n\n\"I wish people would spread more love instead of hate,\" he added.\u00a0\n\nDavid Rodriguez, who was getting gas nearby, told the Associated Press he at first thought he had heard fireworks.\n\nRodriguez said he then saw people running from the Mad Butcher grocery store into the parking lot, and one person lying on the ground.\u00a0\"",

The aftermath of that fall saw the House of Saud (who had had a longstanding alliance with Wahabbi leaders and ruled an Emirate in eastern Arabia) emerge as the rulers of an Arabian state that covered most of the peninsula (with a lot of Western backing). \n\nBut that created a tenuous position. Even as the royal family has expanded and used oil money to modernize Saudi Arabia, enough of their population is in favour of one of the most aggressively reactionary Islamic movements ever to pose a serious threat. This has created a constant threat where any effort to reform which is too liberal might well result in them being thrown from power at best and massacred at worst. [There have been acts of terror against their rule for that very reason in the past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Mosque_seizure). \n\nNow that isn't to defend them\u2014they made their bed, they probably deserve to die in it\u2014but it is the main reason why they are so incredibly tepid in their response to powerful and prominent Saudi's backing terrorism around the globe. Because if they piss off the wrong cleric, they have another ISIS springing up right under their feet. \n\nThis is also, incidentally, a major reason why the US also has little interest in fucking with the Saudis\u2014because if they toppled the monarchy, the most likely result is another Iranian revolution, just Sunni this time and much, much closer to Israel.",
