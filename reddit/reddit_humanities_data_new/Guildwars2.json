            "This looks like Tempest on steroids put into a weapon.  \nAnd I mean that in the most positive way possible because I love it.\n\nI really like the idea of etching out this massive spell and then powering it up. It looks very dramatic (and I will 100% forgive the Etching symbol being the same in all elements aside from the color) and feels like a big spellcasting fantasy, the feeling is 100% on point.\n\nThis weapon is what Tempest and staff should be and not only condenses both in the skillset, but seems to do a better job than both, at the very least when it comes to delivering on this particular mage fantasy.\n\nTiny nitpicks I have for now:  \nEtchings last only 5 seconds. I wonder if that is long enough or if you will be forced to jam other skills without thinking into it to get the big pay-off. I remember the original Catalyst Hammer orbs having a similar issue for the non-benchmark-tier eles among us, so testing might reveal the need for a longer duration on the etching. Just to give us lesser Gods some breathing room.\n\nIn an ideal world I would also ask for a little more dramatic effects on some of the charged Etching spells. The Earth and Water one for example felt a bit underwhelming for such a massive build-up to me. Maybe we can borrow some of the effects from Ai in the Sunqua fractal?\n\nAnd balancewise: If this is going to become our glasscannon power DPS weapon, what will then happen to Staff (redesign into support maybe), Hammer (I have not seen it in ages) or Sword/X (which each power ele build now runs, typically with Warhorn. Will that not lose its niche if Spear is better?)\n\nBut all in all an S-tier first look when it comes to class fantasy, it is wild that Ele Pistol and this Spear Design are from the same team, the difference is massive.",
            "Is the spear update live? Does it come with an expansion or its free update?",

            "Can someone with fewer years translate this for me?",
            "I feel like adding new mechanics to old weapons would overclutter the game and make things needlessly complicated. Like yes i am also a fun of these interactions, i kinda liked pistol eventually and i am insanely hyped for spear (especially due to being a power weapon). But it is also ok to have simplicity in the other weapons. So as they apply to the general more casual audience",
            "I wouldn't mind if they added a bit of themed mechanics to older weapons, but I could also see it being a bit much when layered on top of other mechanics. If every weapon tried to do something like etchings it might go against the weapon-swapping sort of toolbox functionality that most classes tend to use. But smaller within weapon combos like Mesmer spear or such could probably be added onto more existing weapons without being as big of a shift.\n\nI'd also say just having a cohesive theme or role can be good enough without involving special mechanics. Like Ele Staff could do with being a bit more cohesive, but I'd say having AoE/AoE fields could be enough of an identity and don't think it really needs some other thing to keep track of on top of that.",

Skill 5 is the ground circle which once completed gives you the ability to cast 2 new skills. You probably will only care about the normal skill, not the lesser one.

That is 4x Abyssal Raze. Versus a single target not enough to trigger Crushing's secondary effect to trigger another Raze upon weaponswapping (which would have to be paired with legendswap anway it seems, as you are at such low energy at this point you can't do shit).\n\n\nThat feels like quite an energy-hungry weapon that leaves little room for Renegade Legends or Mallyx shenanigans.  \n\nI take it you will pretty HAVE to run the trait that gives additional energy when legendswapping below X amount of energy with this.\n\nAlso wondering how this will stack up vs the condi options Rev already has. It does not seem to beat Shortbow, so can it beat Mace/Axe? It it doesn't, it is mainly a flavour weapon. It it does, Mace/Axe suddenly has no niche anymore.\n\nAnd with just torment, I feel it could use a cover condition of sorts (as well as some speed-buffs, it looked quite slow).\n\nI will 100% keep an open mind until I test this, but I see some bumps on the road ahead.",

            "I was afraid the spear will be a ranged weapon that will do more damage up close, which would be kinda stupid, but range from target only seems to effect aoe effect of some abilities, not the main target damage, which is actually a cool mechanic",
            "You're an actual saint for this",
            "Very straightforward weapon designwise.  \nMaybe not what warriors hoped for, but that is somewhat consistent with how Anet designs warrior weapons.\n\nNow it is obviously a power weapon.  \nFlavourwise I suppose is a matter of taste, but where is this weapon going to land?\n\nBladesworn is married to off-hand pistol and cannot use the burst (where a big part of the power budget sits) that one is out.\n\nI don't think this can compete damage or cc-wise with the Spellbreaker Hammer+Dagger/Axe kit, so that one is also 90% sure to be out.\n\nThat leaves Power Berserker.  \nOnce again, it won't beat Axe/Axe, so the question remains is if it is more powerful than Greatsword.\n\nIf it is, then Greatsword has now officially no purpose left in any PvE setup whatsoever. If it isn't, Spear has no real PvE usecase and will most likely end up as a PvP weapon if it can thrive there.\n\nAnd considering its range components, Spear will also push out whatever usage is left for Rifle, making that weapon absolete as well (aside from maybe WvW Gunflame memes).\n\nFor PvE I also see a design-flaw in Spear Swipe that we also saw back when Ele Catalyst got revealed, where the spec wanted to be in melee but its air CC skill catapulted the ele backwards.  \nThis warrior skill does the same. It wants to be in melee, but with this skill catapults itself back and also pushes foes away from it.\n\nSo warrior either gets a very straightforward (meaning it will get old relatively quick in terms of 'new gameplay excitement') niche weapon for Power Berserker only, or it gets something that is somewhat meh aside from flavour.\n\nFeel free to correct me if you do not share this view, but I am a bit worried.",
            "I know everyone is assessing this from a \u201cwhere does it fit in the meta\u201d PoV; but I really like these from an open world perspective. Being at range doesn\u2019t feel punishing, especially for single target; but you do feel rewarded for being in melee. Because of that, rifle could eventually find a niche as ranged aoe; and you can continue attacking even when you have to retreat, and let your passive heals top you off. \n\nI know it\u2019s hard to not assess it from a meta perspective, but flavor-wise, this is exactly what I want from warrior.",

If it had some non-standard boon share or special utility on one or two of its attacks, it could have made offensive support roles *(qDPS Berserker and aDPS Bladesworn)* at least a bit more interesting.",

I seem to remember that the fury was one of the reasons for Healbrand to run their Axe, so maybe it can compete with that slot (albeit you lose some off-hand goods in the process).\n\nNoticable condi clear on 4, not sure if it scales with shards or is a fixed value.

Using it twice in a row could let us travel 600 units with the first use and then 900 units with second. \n\n**Gleaming Disc**\n\n1. That's a really interesting skills. We have to get up close to get the initial hit. The shockwave though is more forgiving as it has higher radius. \n\n2. A lot of boons can be applied with a proper positioning. But it all relies on allies and enemies being tightly packed together as the radius is only 300. It will work well as a self sustain if you pick Altruistic healing.\n\n3. It is a whirl combo finisher. Which means additional condition cleanse for most elite specs. Firebrand can play with it more as depending on which tome we use it with it can also apply burning or healing.\n\n4. Overall it feels like a more offensive rework of staff #4. It applies half the might but does a lot of damage, blinds and most importantly doesn't lock us in place. \n\n5. I think its illuminated version is also weak.\n\n**Solar Storm**\n\n1. It is an amazing skill. It's great to initiate the fight with.\n\n2. Condition cleanse doesn't fit this skill. I would rather have this effect swapped with the previous skill - Gleaming Disc. As I said this skill is great for initiating combat so it would be better if it granted us and our allies might and fury and for Gleaming Disc to cleanse conditions.\n\n3. Illuminated version is actually good. I quite like the condition we have to fulfill for the next attack to be illuminated. It works well with the theme of Guardian's spear to constantly keep enemies and allies in close range but not full on melee.\n\n4. It has a lot of synergy with disabling effects: cripple, immobilize, chill, slow, wards. Interestingly Dragonhunter can utilize it greatly with Hunter's Ward, Dragon's Maw and Soaring Devastation or even when using Solar Storm on ourselves and pulling the enemy in with the Spear of Justice. \n\n**Symbol of Luminance**\n\n1. It is weakness overload and I love it. It allows Guardians to counter bursts of power damage coming from close range. It is also weakness which will be constantly reapplied. \n\n2. It's good even without using Writ of Persistence. I think the symbol's radius is more important than its duration. Slotting in Writ of Persistance will allow Guardians and especially Firebrands to negate power damage not only from close range but also from mid range.\n\n3. It's a knockback that can interrupt but doesn't push the enemies off the symbol.\n\n4. It can have a lot of synergy with Glacial Heart, Weighty Terms, Stoic Demeanor, Mantra of Truth. A build which buffs allies by blinding, chilling, immobilizing, weakening etc. enemies can be interesing. But also it is easily countered by condition builds.\n\n5. As for the illuminated version. I have mixed feelings. On the one hand it kinda breaks the idea of chaining skills to empower them. On the other it enables spear on non-stationary Guardian elite specs - Willbender. And it also requires you to have it illuminated first. The value of the illuminated Symbol of Luminance will vary greatly on the elite spec used.\n\n**Summary**\n\nIn short I look forward to Guardian's spear. I can see it being used more in competitive game modes. But depending on the damage scaling it may have a place in endgame PvE as well. \n\nAfter looking at all of the spear skills I can see similarities to the Thief and Ranger in terms of mechanics - using a certain skill will flip others into a more powerful versions of themselves. It looks like Guardian's empowered spear skills though can be easily accessed and thus are balanced to be weak (unlike Ranger for example who has to fulfill additional condition to empower spear skills). \n\nIt worries me that spear gameplay will rely on placing Symbol of Luminance and then spamming all other skills in their illuminated version followed by weapon swap. I hope that ANet will make a revision on illuminated versions of spear skills.\n\nTell me what you think about Guardian's spear.",
            "This looks really solid but I feel like it's gonna be tough for WvW guardians to decide when to use it. Mace/shield/staff is such a solid support kit that I can't see myself giving up blocks/aegis, or the utility that staff provides. Guardian truly is the choice paralysis class",
            "Lack of symbols is disappointing. 5 is the only one that does and it's on a 20s cooldown with a 6s duration when traited. It'll limit build since some strong traits turn symbols into healing and debuffing moves.\n\nI suppose you could pair it with, say hammer, but I'm not sure what that rotation would look like.\n\nStill looking forward to it but I'm not sure how it's going to compete with other support weapons. At least in PvE.",
            "Auto hits just 3 targets while ranged warrior spear hits 4 and old staff hit 5. Smaller cone than old staff. Symbol is way smaller than ele edgings although symbols are guard's thing. Forced movement garbage on 2. Thanks for nothing. Dogshit weapon.\n\nFun how you designed ele spear to be as broken as possible and then designed guard spear like it may not even exist. You gave eles their broken dps staff back and guards can't even have their lootstick again. No favoritism at all.\n\nThe effects aren't even blue. It's also an ugly yellow weapon.",
            "I can see this replacing staff, depending how the healing coefficients are (*and* if the cc-value of staff 5 isn't that big or needed). With the recent buffs to the might application via tome 1 on firebrand the 6 might on spear 3 might be enough to cap it, in addition to fury. Empower on staff has a nice healing attached to it but to max might you are always spamming it, so you aren't getting everything out of that healing in a lot of cases. With healing on autoattacks and helio rush i don't see a lot of reasons to run staff, except you have a lot of downtime in you personal dps and can't connect the gleaming disc.\n\nThe axe/shield set offers fury, a bit of cc and especially additional protection for 100% prot uptime. Not sure how easy it is to reach that without shield (maybe on cooldown tome 3 - skill 5 + traited symbol on heal ?), but shield 5 is hard to beat for fights with projectiles. Not sure when you would want to go staff/spear in that case.",
            "> so lootstick is back with this yeah?\n\nSo it would seem! Slightly changed but reasonable:\n\n[**OLD LOOTSTICK**](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Wave_of_Wrath)|**NEW LOOTSTICK**\n--:|:--\n1s cast time|**0.5s cast time**\n**5 enemy targets**|3 enemy targets\nN/A|**3 ally targets**\nN/A|**Ally heals**\n300 range|**350 range**\n110\u00b0 Angle|_(currently unknown)_\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe new ''loostick'' hits fewer enemies but definitely has enhanced effects - faster, wider range, can also heal allies",
            "> Forced movement garbage on 2. \n\nWhat the hell is a charge-type attack supposed to do if not move the player? There's also a flipover to cancel it early too.\n\nAs a mostly PvE player that does some WvW roaming here and there, I'm a little disappointed, but I could see this being a great weapon for WvW zerging.",
            "You can upkeep 100% prot without Shield, but you have to play Tome 3 more.  \nAnd you can also provide 100% 25 Might without Staff, but need Tome 1 a lot more for that.  \nAlso for either Scenario you have to adjust your Trait Choices a bit, but it works ezpz.\n\nThe Problem is that the Utility on Axe/Mace + Shield and Staff is just sooo much better then what the Spear has atm. Resolution it not a Thing you desperately need as a Guardian. Might and Fury are covered anyway...different Boons would be a better pick for Spear 3. and having a Symbol on a long CD is just sadge =(\n\nThey should make it a longer pulsing Symbol (bc looooong cd), but give it a different Boon (maybe Resolution even) and put rly short Resistance on the Spear 2 instead. Also I'd like to see a small Heal at the End of Spear 2 Movement so you can zoom into the Group (similar to a bit of alac at the end of WB F2)",
            "You can make it a ground-target leap or blink. No one needs shitty forced movement dash attacks."
