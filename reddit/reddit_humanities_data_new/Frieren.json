            "Is it a human hiatus or an elven hiatus?",
            "> Frieren is on indefinite hiatus\n\nAll I hope is that both author and artist are in good health and in good spirits. But \u201cindefinite hiatus\u201d is certainly news worth ringing alarm bells for, even if we know this manga is one to take long gaps between chapters.",
            "I'm kinda worried by the fact Frieren woke up early, seems like she is worried by the whole situation.\nAlso I'm glad we are not finished with Denken he is  one of my favorites character",
            "So happy for the unexpected reappearance of Gl\u00fcck, Macht and Denken! Such top-tier characters, all of them.\n\nIn a country with one of the world's highest life expectancies, *mangakas* only have an expected lifespan of under 65 years. This is with *only* natural deaths concerned, and not acts of violence&harm of any kind. \n\nIf a hiatus is needed, so be it. Whether it's awesome planning for Season 2 of the anime, or just more rest and time for better health, let us all hope that the creatives get the most out of it!",
            "What an incredible chapter.\n\nIt felt like a long time since we got a chapter like this, with no action and (just a little) funny scenes but a long and deep narration about the political situation of the characters into play.\n\nFirst of all, we get to see Gl\u00fcck and Denken back in action: people have speculated about their return because of their involvement with the Empire, and now it is clear how the \u201chidden forces\u201d of the Empire wants to act: using Gl\u00fcck to restrain Denken from acting, and counting on the fact that the influence of Denken within the Empire causes the CMA to distrust him.\n\nUnfortunately, they both are such chads that these tactics are useless; I wonder how Denken will act; it seems like he can only do some side-work, but who knows\u2026\n\nAnother important piece of information is the identity of the Captain of the Special Forces of Magic, Phrase. A mage powerful enough to be acknowledged by Macht is surely going to be a pain to handle, and lead to interesting fights. Maybe she even grew more powerful in the last 50 years, up to the level of Lernen.\n\nThe pieces are converging into place; I think the real action will start when the Empire plans begin, so during the Foundation Festival when Serie arrives; unfortunately we will have to wait for the hiatus to end.",
            "When the author return, we\u2019ll all be acting like Himmel when Frieren returned to the city after their adventure lmao",
            "\"Frieren-sama woke up early.\" \"...is that supposed to be incredible?\" \"It's absolutely earthshattering. There will surely be a cataclysm tomorrow.\" \n\nAlmost right Stark, although the hiatus already hit us today.",
            "Frieren waking up early and preparing herself\u2026 She definitely sensed something but doesn\u2019t want to say it to Stark and Fern. \n\nHope that the hiatus is not too long and only for logistical reasons, I have been through too many hiatus that ends with the artist never coming back and I don\u2019t want that for Frieren",
            "One interesting detail I noticed is that Gluck had always let Macht lighting his cigarette, ever since their first encounter to their final goodbye. However, here, Gluck refused to let the officer light his cigar (most likely stem from her habit with the captain), instead chose to light it himself. I wonder if this is a sign of Gluck's trust to someone.",
            "Nobody here seems to be worried about an indefinite hiatus. From my experience with those, they end with\u2026 nothing. I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s a reason not to worry with Frieren\u2019s creator specifically?",

            "To have such mana and evil vibe that the strongest demon wants you dead right then and there is quite a feat.\n\nThis chapter kinda has me retracts my accusation on the empire being scummy. In the end, it was really about who is in charge and control of political influences.",

            "I hope that the author and the artist get a lot of rest. Now it's time for Frieren: Beyond Lobotomy's End",
            "Seems like Phrase is the one who barged in on Land's grandma. Wonder what the old lady did to get such a high ranking official on her tail. More mystery with Land's background...\n\nGluck is a real one. Guy commited himself to all of his sins with Macht and continues to honor that even now.\n\nAs for the hiatus we went crazy with a month. I fear what kinda loony bin this place becomes with an indefinite return.",
            "Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear oh dear. This is not good. With that sort of hint, there's a damn good chance that a demon is collaborating with the Empire. With all the political finesse thing going on, another damn good chance Grausam has poked his face out to meddle with the world again. \n\n...Wait, what am I worried about? Grausam, another batch of Frimmel fanfiction, please. Oh, and a dish of Ubeland, a side of Stern, and maybe even an appetizer of Seriekraft as well. I eagerly await your cooking.",
            "Gluck Macht crumbs I am LIVING. Best dubious duo. Did not expect to see them again, at least in this way, so soon.\n\nMan, so many interesting implications being set up about demons and humans narratives of them here. Especially tied with a character that had such a heavy emphasis on words and their meanings, to be sat across a character asking him to say something that isn't true. Macht saying he wants to vanquish Weise's enemies was weirdly touching. Lots and lots of things that have been woven throughout the story coming to a head here. I'm a huge fan of political intrigue and, tbh, never expected to be so fully invested in Frieren's take on it (or expected Frieren to have political intrigue of this scale). Also, Frieren woke up early, so we must praise her when she does well making a reappearance was such a funny way to end it.\n\nAs a fan of Noragami, I loathe to see \"indefinite hiatus\", but if I could make it through the 14 month one I can make it through this. If I had two nickles or something. I optimistic that Frieren will make a return more quickly than that, but with a story this meticulous, I just want the writer and artist to remain healthy and full of creative juice to be able to tell their story.",
            "I hope they\u2019re doing well and can come back to Frieren in a good place",
            "Frieren said that the manga will come back soon.\n\nA mere 10 year hiatus.",

            "Sad about the hiatus, let\u2019s hope it\u2019s a hiatus for them to organise the second season of the anime/cook an amazing arc.\n\nNot much happened in this chapter but kinda glad it was this way since I don\u2019t think I could endure it if it ended in a cliffhanger.\n\nThe emperor seems to be a wise person and very lenient towards Gl\u00fcck and favours Denken quite a lot since he didn\u2019t force Denken to choose a side, just sent him away.\n\nStill it didn\u2019t answer the question of why is serie and frieren on the kill list and it doesn\u2019t seem like the shadow warriors are working with the Special Forces so far.\n\n\nSense multitasking was cute, will reread the chapter more times to see if I missed anything else.",
            "Falsce in an apron. Hmm. That works for me.\n\nI wonder if the other First Class Mages who do missions with Sense have to play den mother for her? She seems to have the same kind of morning uselessness Frieren usually has?  \ud83e\udd2d",
            "Whelp. Time to look for other mangas to read....\n\n\n*Cries in a corner*",
            "Last chapter before hiatus was a callback to Gluck, Denken, and Macht? Could the author be hinting at working on season 2.",
            "Some of my thoughts this chapter:\n\nWe got some more named characters of the Magic Special Forces, so I think all named MSF characters are:\n\n* Frase, the Captain (Phrase in fan-translation)\n* Kanone, the Vice-Captain\n* Neu\n* Weg\n\nI might be over thinking it but the part where Kanone was talking about \"conspiring with demons\" made me think she didn't think it was such a strange thought, like something else like that had happened before?\n\nThey were more lenient with Gluck then I thought they would be.\n\nI'm happy to see Denken, but it looks like he might be pushed to the side this arc since no one trusts him. I wouldn't be surprised if he played some kind of support role at one point though.\n\nLol that ending. How chill Falsch was in the background was funny. Sense was great too, how she was wondering what was so great about Frieren getting up early haha.\n\n..However, the implication of Frieren being worried is less funny, especially if you look back at the first page.\n\n*^(Edit: Added Weg since she was mentioned briefly in chapter 128.)*",
            "Just to clarify the hiatus announcement, it's:  \n\u6b21\u53f7\u3088\u308a\u4f11\u8f09\u3067\u3059\n\nWhich roughly translated is:  \nThere will be a hiatus starting from the next issue.\n\nIf I'm reading it correctly, this means that we'll be getting another chapter, then the hiatus starts with no specified end date.\n\nEdit to add some context: The announcement was included at the end of chapter 130 in the original Japanese publication last Sunday.  The use of the word \"indefinite\" is, while technically correct since no end was defined, a bit hyperbolic imo, but I see it often used in these cases even when the hiatus is simply temporary but open-ended.",
            "Hiatus sucks, but if thay is what it takes to write a masterpiece like this manga, let them have their break.\n\nThis arc is crazy, very specific style of antagonist and pretty scary. Demons feel like you understand, but humans are complex to narrow down, especially for Frieren",
            "Bed head Sense tho",
            "\"Something terrible is going to happen tomorrow\" ... **indefinite hiatus** set up a giant cliffhanger and then dissappear, that's unfortunate. \n\nI really like that Denken is getting his proper position in all of this. He's both a first class mage who has seen firsthand how overwhelmingly powerful serie is, and he's a very high ranking imperial mage who is very familiar with the top brass there. \n\nI now feel more confident that what's going on is the Imperial Mages trying to sieze dominance over the CMA through their trained assassins, the shadow warriors. Probably only the very top people in the special forces of magic are even aware of the shadow warriors, and clearly most of the shadow warriors have no idea why they're even doing what they're doing. But it makes perfect sense that the imperial mages would resent Serie and her CMA and would seek to enforce their dominance over the world's magic.\n\nIt's also interesting to think about, given the emphasis in this chapter, that it was the CMA that contained Weiss, rather than the Empire, despite Weiss being part of the Empire's territory. Especially especially since the Empire sent their top psycopath mage to sniff out what was going on before Weiss was turned into El Dorado.",
            "Well damn I guess Frieren waking up early really did cause a catastrophe after all",
            "Surprised to see Denken! I honestly thought they were gonna say he retired after El Dorado and was in a beach somewhere with Laufen and Richter and that's why he wouldn't show up (since his position made it impossible for him to not be at least mentioned in this arc). But it seems like neither side trusts him and that's why he'll probably be mostly on the bench this time lol (I think that's fine, he already got the spotlight in El Dorado, gotta give the others panel time too). The Empire seems to be trying to gently kick him out of the capital and keep him in Weiss while the Serie situation happens, but maybe he'll do something before leaving/leave something for the CMA? Idk",
            "\"Frieren is on an indefinite hiatus.\"\n\nWhat, WHAT.",
            "Frieren woke up early because the hiatus announcement \ud83d\ude1e",
            "Jeez, Phrase instantly put Macht at Defcon 1. And that was 50 years ago if I understand correctly. It sounds like she's going to be a problem and a half",
            "So Phrase is the one that raided Land home huh?",
            "The way the author weaves the story and characters together so perfectly and in such easy to understand, yet unpredictable ways is incredible.",
            "Dang the months with the lobotomy would be freaking long man",
            "Can i ask usually how long do these hiatuses (idk the plural) last? im new to manga and havenot read many so this is sth new for me, also is there a reason for the hiatus because i would nvr expect this after the massive successs it had with the anime",
            "Sleepy-head Sense my beloved. Looks like Denken still has a part to play!\n\n\n\n\nI like how people are treating Denken as though he has split loyalties, even though he himself knows exactly where he stands\u00a0",
            "Sorry serie, I think you gonna die, frieren did the impossible and woke up early",
            "So from what I understand, the Empire technically sympathizes with Gluck, and wants him to remain the lord of Weise, which is why Kanone was trying to get him to confess that Macht was manipulating him. But Gluck still wanted to be punished for his crimes in disposing of the problematic nobility in Weise, even if it meant prosperity for the city. And the Empire is likely aware that Denken is a 1st class mage, so they want to get him out of the way so he doesn't try anything?\n\nAlso, it's kind of insane to think that even Macht, the strongest of the Seven Sages, was spooked by Phrase *50 years ago*. Imagine how much stronger she is now.",
            "\"I'm not at that point yet. Feed me!\" With the smug face and all. \n\nI'm gonna miss this manga's updates. I really hope the author is doing well health-wise.",
            "Interesting to see Denken so soon! I thought he might go on the bench for a long time after Macht arc.\n\nKanone is a very interesting character, considering that she also seems to be the undercover first-class mage from the Continental Magic Association (which Denken hints at in this chapter). She's in quite a tough spot! I'm curious to learn more about the \"real\" her, as opposed to the persona we've been seeing. \n\nSeems like Frase will probably be Frieren's opponent for this arc, and we will get to see a human mage challenging Frieren in ways that only Frieren herself and Solitar have challenged Frieren so far. Pretty exciting! Hope that the break isn't too long and (more importantly) that the creative team are doing OK.",
            "that foreshadowing from Stark lol\n\n..... I hope \"tomorrow\" comes soon",
            "So sad, I hope frieren doesn't go the way of berserk and hunter x hunter. \n\nI am holding hope for the manga coming back about the same time as a season 2 anime in a year or so.",
            "And Stark was right, there will be a cataclysm for an indefinite length.",
            "Sousou no Hiatus",
            "With each panel Sense appears in, I love her a little bit more. She's pure, undiluted, morning before coffee mood.\n\n\n\n\n\nI see that Kanone is pretty crafty, finding ways to convey information to Gl\u00fcck and Denken without compromising himself at all. He shows the Special Forces of Magic are not a monolith (much less the Empire itself), despite how much loyalty and discipline they have, and that may be where the whole situation is coming from.\n\n\n\nWe'll have to wait to see what's up. But Macht showing concern about Phrase's power is telling.\n\n\n\nI loved Frieren's \"Feed me\" face. And Starks deadpan face while forecasting a cataclysm, which is probably true.",
            "I hope it's a normal hiatus and not because of health problems, the lack of info is worrying",
            "Sense is mad cute at the end there. How much higher can her cuteness go? Bedhair Sense was so freaking cute at the end. Sense grabbing the tea with her hair too. Idk why but I want 1000 fanarts based on that one panel of her eating bread. I need her to eat cake, pizza, hamburgers, babies, grass, rocks, lasagna, dumplings, chicken, and spaghetti at least. Oh you know that one panel of Fami from CSM stuffing her face with spaghetti? I need that.  \n  \nALSO OMG WHAT FRIEREN WAKING UP EARLY? AND SHE\"S DRESSED? AND HER HAIR IS TIED WHAT IS THIS? Holy shit ok things must really be going down soon then. Are we going to get a nuclear apocalypse or something? Everything is wrong. Even an indefinite hiatus. I'm scared.  \n  \nAnyway, we get to see Chad Denken again so maybe things can't be that bad right?",

He usually present at events of the CMA, apologizes to Serie, lectures to Sense about not fighting with Linear, chides her for bad habits while eating and even goes the extra mile to wear an apron while preparing breakfast. \n\nGlad to see Gluck, Macht and Denken again. Gluck seems to treasure the bond and relationship he shared with Macht while Denken is caught in an awkward position of both a first class mage and imperial mage of the empire.",

            "I feel like the hiatus is related to the second season of the anime.",
            "I know it's being treated as a harbinger, but Frieren waking up early, Fern's shock, and the positive reinforcement just made me laugh. Sense is flabbergasted by the spectacle just like Stark before her. Next time Frieren wakes up early hope to see Sense joining in on the pampering by braiding Frieren's hair or something.",
            "Indefinite hiatus? Is that supposed to be impressive?",

It's excellent when plot threads continue to impact the story down the line. I wonder what involvement he'll have here.

            "What Stark said might be a foretelling but I think it is considering how Frieren looks at the first page. The reason she woke up early is maybe because she can't sleep well as she can detect a troublesome mana but is not hostile to her yet.\n\nDemons and Magic Special Forces Mages might be similar also in terms of not hiding/limiting their mana as it is also a form of status for them and that's why Macht can tell immediately that Frase is a problem.\n\nI think Frase might be the same Old Magical Enforcer on Land's brief flashback. I could be wrong though.\n\nWhat I'm truly excited about this arc is Fern showing off her arsenal of magic. It's been implied many times that she only uses basic attack spells as it is already enough to defeat the mage of her generation but since they're facing off against the \"non-typical\" mages, I'm excited what other spells she can pull out of her pocket.\n\nGluck is a total chad though. Bro really went to his interrogation > smoked a cig > stand up for his homie > trashtalked about Frase > leaves.",

I think she might even surpass Serie when it comes to fighting Warriors, simply because it would seem out of character from Himmel not to teach/help Frieren fight/defend herself against Warriors like him or Eisen. Since it seems they are a 'weakness' of mages, and we also saw that some demons fight with swords rather than magic.\n\nIt's just my opinion, but it seems like Frieren is still hiding many things, so I wouldn't be surprised if she had a trump card that would turn the battle around for them against the 'Warrior assassins'.",

We have/had many serious arcs and many dangerous battle and still no one died, Denken could have died in his battle against Macht and even he is still alive. And now even Gl\u00fcck is spared and just let go like that when executing him or even CONTINUING to keep him hostage against Denken could have be much more realistic ? It is almost like a fairy tale where nobody on the good side actually suffers consequences. These last chapters are all dedicated to show us how powerful and deadly the empire is and an entire plot to assassinate freakin SERIE and yet i cannot find believing anyone noteworthy from the Frieren side will actually die.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0I hope i am wrong because for a series like this such an unrealistic thing of people on the \u201cgood\u201d side all surviving while enemies die is just too cliche and takes out all the stakes so if it is happens again this time then no future battle will ever be exciting since you will know that no matter the enemy everyone will be fine\u00a0",

Of course I don't think Frieren or Fern are going to lack for action, but I strongly believe that Stark will get to shine here, because otherwise the introduction of all of these anti-mage figures and mechanics, will be narratively pointless.

Like, an analogy of demon magic to natural disaster, it is possible to deal with something you don't understand. Same here with human emotions, while demons cannot understand, some especially Macht can perceive that these emotions are taking place i.e. Macht knowing that kid Denken had a crush on Lecture or knowing Gluck had ordered assassination.  \nSecond, Macht is usually calm and collected. He knew when Frieren tried to provoke him. He was also careful about Weise and its well-being. His assassination jobs were always silent with no collateral and even when he transmuted the city, it was instantaneous. No one besides Gluck realized what was happening. So for Macht to actively ask for permission to fight someone with enough power to destroy city means: he has calculated that early collateral damage from fight is definitely worth the risk and felt that this person was always ready to make a preemptive strike on the town citizens.",

If you look back at the flashback where we see Lineal in chapter 127, you will see that she is a young-ish woman with very long, very black hair (just like Kanone!), and that she is in a position where she has access to sensitive information (just like Kanone!). Later in Chapter 127, where Kanone and her partner catch Ubel and Land searching the room, Kanone repeatedly tries to steer her partner away from Ubel and Land. It's subtle, but pretty convincing once you re-read and look at what she's doing.\n\nAdd that to this chapter, where Denken seems to imply that Kanone may answer to more than one \"authority\"/\"mission\", and that's some further evidence.\n\nPlus, on a meta level, it just makes sense for Kanone to be Lineal if Kanone is being given so much attention, given that she's otherwise a pretty random side character.",

Simply because she got to observe strong warriors for 10 years, whereas I think Serie wouldn't even give warriors the time of day.\n\nEvidence: she only got Mages to protect her, true they are mages who specialize in close combat.

So denken decided to run away, but this is when macht said \"you can't outrun my diagolze\". As we saw with the barrier, his use of diagolze takes time to reach a destination, but it can expand over time arguably an infinite distance. and it's faster than basic flying\n\nthe running away has nothing to do with him knowing when he releases it.

Is it three syllables or two? The \u201cf\u00fa l\u00ec\u201d part almost sounds like it's joined together into one syllable, like a \\ fwi \\ sound, but maybe that's just because I don't speak the language \ud83d\ude05. I'm talking about 0:09 in the video btw.\n\nI tried listening to Google Translate's pronunciation of Himmel and... It sound nothing like Frieren's. At least I would think Frieren's Chinese name's pronunciation would sound similar if it was said really fast in an effort to imitate how the voice actors pronounce it.\n\nThe literal meaning of the characters used for Himmel's name surprisingly captures his character pretty well, too! I suppose an argument could be made that he's a \u201chappy plum\u201d of sorts, whatever that would even mean \ud83e\udd14",

Wow, the reporters ask long haired guy to explain why the quote / what it means to him \ud83d\ude01 they spend longer than expected time on the topic!\n\nI think some time has passed between incident and interviews - even so, the long haired guy is so chill for having helped stopped the attacker, and suffered serious slashes on the face. He shrugs at the wounds and it's cause of his mom he went to get wounds and scars treated \ud83e\udd79 \n\nAwesome teamwork between the ppl that swarmed attacker !! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc Turned around a really shitty situation - thankfully no deaths (I think)",
            "Ah so there is an R but it's not something outsiders would consider R in their language. Did I get that right? Based on what I can hear from Google Translate's pronunciation of Himmel's name, the R sounds smooth with a sound reminiscent of dropping your chin slightly and forming an \u201co\u201d with your mouth. It definitely sounds nothing like how English pronounces R, that much I can say. So if that's what you meant by \u201cdistinct to the Chinese language\u201d then I understand.",

            "Okay I think I forgot something loll. Because Japanese and Chinese both use kanji or han characters, the translators don't bother translating phonetically and everything just changes into Chinese. Now they don't always mean or sound the same. For example shinichi from Conan becomes xinyi. And Frieren becomes fu li lan. \n\nHowever since himmel's name only appears in katakana, it is translated phonetically and Himmel becomes xin mei er. (Can you hear it? I can't.)\n\nAnd I menat r as in the pinyin r, which is \u3116 and sounds similar to l which is \u310c but if you touch the roof of your mouth with your tongue. \n\nNow the English rrr sound in vroom doesn't exactly exist but sounds similar to the pinyin r. \n\nThe er sound in himmel's name is \u3126 but it sounds pretty much like it's spelled. \n\nAlso ri doesn't exist in Chinese although ran and ren do.",
