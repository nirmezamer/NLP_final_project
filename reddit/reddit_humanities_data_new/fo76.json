            "Can we get an update that fixes the fuckin constant game crashes on consoles? Its at least 2x per hour or mpre if you get into an event",
            "I just want an update that says meat week will prioritize unlearned plans before you start getting duplicates, the list, is getting long :')",
            "Are the devs going to add an option in the settings menu to disable the visuals from explosion effects like the Cremator? Thanks.",
            "Does anyone know how long the new content is ? Talking more like missions / story stuff. Not all the new side stuff. Really hope it comes out early June, because Elden Ring DLC is end of June.",
            "I just want to know \u2026 can we cook the turkeys ?",
            "So\u2026 what exactly changed with the nukes? Were they killing players during the two events, or was something else wrong?",
            "Will the 'Skyline' update coincide with the start of next season + new scoreboard?",
            "QOL suggestion: Add more audio sounds customization:  \n- your character sounds  \n- other players characters sounds  \n- NPCs/enemies  \n- explosions/gunshooting/receiving dmg  \n  \n I would love to decrease particular sounds like \"receiving damage\" of my character and also nearby players. It gets really noisy and weird with all of them moans and ouches and heavy guns spinning fast. I usually play in the night, so my gf have some background noise or music to fall asleep to, but not that type of chaotic noise during any event or dops/expeditions :/\n\nAlso extra QOL: possibility to tweak/turn vats critical highlight screen and sound. When we play 33 luck, we get crit every shot and this flashes screen a bit too much/too fast",
            "All I beg for is a buff to the Strangler Heart PA",
            "Does anyone know if this will add more achievements to the game like the other DLCs did?",
            "Please add enclave plasma rifle plans already, it's been years. And this is the only gun that is problematic to simply mod. What gives? Also bring back the Gauss shotgun range to what it was, it is a gauss gun, not s pea shooter.",
            "I have 400 tickets I should use them all in the next couple of days right?",
            "Seasons definitely needs some tweaks, some hardly got close to rank150. Way too grindy.",
            "So my map wont update for the skyline valley ive redownloaded it a bunch and still nothing had the game on gameppass and was thinking maybe its the gamepass version so i bought the game and still nothing do i have to get past a certain point for it to pop up",
            "Yeah, 40gb full of bugs. Start doing something with crashes!!! 5x in a row on ps5, and now after update game freeze. This isnt normal...oh wait, yes it is! Bethesda great work, again sucks \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
            "I deleted the game 3 times ( 2 times downloaded to my ps5 ssd and one time downloaded to an external hdd) and i still get crashes doing normal functions in the game. Never had issues like this before the skyline valley update so im done with this game until these bugs can be patched.",
            "Fix the strangler bloom bs",
            "Thank god they\u2019re fixing the cave crickets",
            "When is the update coming out?",
            "Honestly very hyped and want to try it, but sadly my SSD would complain if I downloaded the FO76 PTS app. Already have so much Bethsoft games that I keep going back to. Plus Skyline Valley PTS coincided with Gold Road release.  \n  \nHope when it's time to commit to live server bugs are already ironed out, and I can enjoy the full experience.",
            "I just want The Ticket to Revenge \ud83d\ude02",
            "yo",
            "I own FO76 for PS. Is this update free or will I require a purchase to access Skyline Valley?",
            "Anyone else encounter a bug during the mission Into Lands Unknown where you plant the flares on the bodies and it takes like 30 seconds for the prompt to go away and you're stuck? It happened for all three of them and the third time got me killed.",
            "The weird messages from the lost remind me of the nazi zombies from South Park: The Stick of Truth. Like it's a dead ringer for them. Maybe even a reference?",
            "37.5 GB update and the thing hasn\u2019t topped out over 475KB/s.\n\nI\u2019m not gonna play until sometime next week I guess.",
            "   Contemporary porch corner is now twice. The middle one is gone and has now 4 corners just like the normal one. The connection is there attached to the section in the animation but it needs to be turned 90 degrees by a developer to make one of the corner beams disappear. Please fix this my porch looks awful now.",
            "If you are disappointed with the changes to seasons, which isn't a good direction the game is going. You can always leave a review on steam. This is what Helldivers 2 community did.",
            "Seasonal 150 reward is a joke.",
            "I\u2019m actually hesitant to play the new quest line.  The BOS was over so quick and left me wanting more\u2026",
            "AZz4",
            "I just spent all of my ammo and resources on fixing my gear because Hugo will not die and regens infinitely. I tried the fight 4 times with different weapons. After reworking my perks, rerolling my cremator a few times and spending all my caps on fuel the laser grid won't let me back in to try again.",
            "Just downloaded the patch and it finally finished and now I'm logging on, hopefully it won't crash every 5 minutes!",
            "Do we not have a roadmap this year?\n\nSeems like from that huge player spike a good amount actually kept playing.",
            "This is a nice and interesting update with huge loads of content. I just hope in the near future where the custom world has the option on/off button where it removes limits to the S.P.E.C.I.A.L tabs so that players can equip all cards to make the game more enjoyable. I am a huge fan of the custom world besides the online/private adventure.",
            "Not paying 13 dollars a month for unlimited scrap box. Looks like I'll continue to not play. Shame.",
            "Great! Another valuable update completely ignored by me (I play on consoles and will never be able to access pts)",
            "I'm hoping their next gen FO4 release was basically a test run for the game engine before trying to roll out a next gen version for FO76. \n\nI'm on PS5 and less stable games like this or COD tend to crash more often if I play the PS4 version, probably because it has to convert a lot of extra data for backwards compatibility to work on the newer system. PS5 versions are more stable on PS5. Hopefully they'll finally roll out a PS5 version of FO76 nd the crashes, slow loading, lagging, etc. will also go away. But I've been waiting years for that",
            "Mine keeps crashing each time I try to use a vendor. The second one just made my whole console freeze up",
            "Ps5 crashes are egregious. Telling everyone to leave the game until the update arrives. If it will ever arrive!",
            "Mine crashes every time I try to sign in. I have to restart at least once a day without fail.",
            "Literally came to say this. I just logged on, fast traveled to a camp, and it crashed. It crashed prior to this update but it is doing it way more now.  And it\u2019s very annoying.",
            "It\u2019s every five minutes today. Don\u2019t even dare open any kind of HUD.",
            "Isn't that how it used to be? I seem to remember getting unknown plans first. Did people cry about it or something?",
            "I'd love this for older events too, i still haven't seen yao guai claw/carnival pie and cowboy duster drop and i have been playing those two whenever they pop up since nuka world dropped.",
            "This kind of niave optimistic outlook in the game is why most of us play it still.",
            "Honestly think this would take the fun out of it. I like rolling and sometimes getting a duplicate to sell. Makes it feel more special when I land the one I want.",
            "But then there would be not a whole lot of incentive to do meat week once you got them all within the first couple days.",
            "Make that the entire game then f yes",
            "Pretty sure it doesn't , missing only the corpse pile with flies on it and I keep getting duplicates over and over to the point where I could probably offload my dupes to my mule and have them instantly have all the rewards lol.",
            "Theres a mod for that so i would assume no, just use the mod \nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/2359",
            "I\u2019ve played through it on the PTS, and while I did have to break it up for the sake of reality getting in the way, it took me four to five hours. This matches with what one of the Bethesda devs said it took them when they tested it, though someone sped through it in three. Aside from the questline, however, there\u2019s a new event, a new nuke boss and an entire toxic valley sized region to explore (the last one will take a little while).\n\nGoing off of the release date of the last major patch (end of March), late June is more likely than early since Bethesda typically tries to keep the major updates about three months apart.",
            "I played through it twice (long story) in 6 hours.  I was intentionally absorbing the experience, reading logs, etc.   I do feel that I got my money's worth.   There's some very entertaining new characters.\n\nThey had some great setups for drama (the communist camp!!!(???)) that were underused.\n\nThe first hour is exceptionally wonderful, in terms of pacing and atmosphere, and the last 2/3rds of the DLC doesn't meet that first hour's quality standard.\n\nThat criticism aside, it was definitely entertaining, and I'm looking forwards to the release.   I didn't get a chance to play the events in a team, so I'm reserving judgement there.",
            "There's a road map you can look at online that says it releases 6th of June so here's hope it's true\ud83e\udd1e",
            "on the wiki for the pts stuff, there's a camp item that looks like a thanksgiving turkey, and im pretty sure we can make them into food too. not just table settings lol",
            "In some of the data mines it shows a resource item like the ragstad field dressing station so I assume they're cookable",
            "more than likely so around june 25th",
            "I kinda like that modding the enclave Plasma gun is different from modding other guns. Makes it seem more special and sets it apart from the normal plasma rifle instead of just being a straight upgrade.",
            "100% before the season ends. And remember they accidentally launched a previous season early so it could happen again",
            "Free.",
            "Probably close to 90% of the community does not touch the PTS. The updates are just nice to know what is coming in a month or so when we get the update.",
            "existence screw bells zephyr grandfather pocket gray long salt rich\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*",
            "You're annoying",
            "Same. \u00a0Finished playing until it is fixed.\u00a0",
            "I think it does it for Mothman Equinox, but the list of rewards for Meat Week is pretty much just as long if not longer, now.",
            "Nuka World On Tour rare plans are tough to get. I think 2% chance for each. I ended up trading for them, couldn't grind that stuff anymore lol.",
            "I got a cowboy duster plan in an event this past week",
            "When I was a newbie and other people shared the love I gave a guy that recipe for like only 400 caps and he gave me a bunch of good weapons haha so at the end of events always ask if anyone got the recipe- some unknowing low levels will give it for cheap! I do these events pretty often tho so I'm ok with my unknowing generosity.",
            "I'd been searching for that pastry recipe ever since I learned about it. 75 carry weight is awesome.\n\njust got the yao guai pastry recipe...right after the mirelurk steamer came out.  Haven't even read it.",
            "Can't do that on console smh. And id argue console needs it the most with xb1 and ps4 still being supported. Fatman explosion effects can crash your game if someone has a 2 shot Fatman at a boss or huge event",
            "I appreciate the response, cool to know.",
            "Awesome, thanks for replying. I\u2019m pretty excited! Been playing since launch and dropping back in and out through the years. Game has come an extremely long way, let\u2019s hope the series has given the game more resources.",
            "The community Calendar only states Gold Rush for June 6th. There is usually a double SCORE weekend right before a season ends to help people finish on a strong note, so the calendar hints at the new season/patch coming June 25th.",
            "I came across a guy in regular servers that was lvl 5000 that had a thanksgiving turkey on his table i wonder if he was a dev his house was next level and looked better than anything i'd ever seen someone create outside of the devs themselves.",
            "Give me a functional update of give me death!",
            "Quit yapping about stuff im already aware of... It's the wait that's killing me not the fact it's a test server nerd.",
            "Yes, they did that for Equinox, but not for Meat Week",
            "That\u2018s probably the thing. Each plan has a certain chance to be rewarded to a player. If they choose out of non known plans only it would increase the chance of getting rare plans every time you play that event.",
            ">\u00a0pastry recipe ever since I learned about it.\u00a0 75 carry weight is awesome\n\nTell me about it :)\n\nIn case you haven't noticed, once a week, (mondays, I think) there are 3 pastrys on the shelf behind Betty.  Free.  And you can buy one more from her for around 60 caps. \n\nI grab them and put them in the Cryogenic freezer.   Pull them from my stash as needed.   (same with smoked mireluck filets)\n\nOne of those with a deathclaw steak chaser (+4 STR, which is 20# carry), and if its really bad, a carry weight booster.  Puts me well over 500# carry.  More if I'm at an event and a lunchbox included gift bag :)",
            "Bruuuh, we need an update for ps5 too, if not explosions, I feel i error so much because I have to run the ps4 version, or erroring a lot an issue on ps4? And I mean like it just happening, illnhave been doing work at my camp or something and it just happens",
            "You\u2019re welcome!",
            "I totally agree.   I would love to get more 'surface area' in future DLC, so I hope this is the beginning of a new direction.   \n\nAlso agree with the resourcing, I'm hoping the current 'fallout craze' leads to the F76 team getting more folks.  \n\nHope you enjoy your time with the DLC",
            "This is a double score weekend along with double caps.",
            "Testing on the PTS is how they deliver a functional update on the live servers.",
            "honestly that should be how it is for every event , basically it runs through the list of the plans you dont have and rewards from that list until the list is empty then it just rewards at random",
            "Yes. Yes it is. What an odd thing to say.",
            "Yep, that's why I personally think that this meet weak giving out known plans is a bug, not feature",
            "If the new season comes out the 6th this weekend which is an unscheduled double score weekend would fit the bill for what you say they usually do when closing out a season.",
            "Yes, however, all the previous ones have been planned, not unplanned. So, yes. It can be like that if they change the pattern completely.",
            "The Xbox Games Showcase is June 9th so I'm curious if it will be released or at least announced durring the show. I'm would be surprised if it weren't part of it."

Giving you all a lot of time to provide feedback on the adjustments being made to ensure we\u2019re moving in a positive direction.\n\n# Season 17 \u2013 Pioneer Scouts\n\nThe sun is out and it\u2019s time to head on over to Summer Camp.

Once learned, they will no longer be able to be obtained.\n\nAdditionally, Union Power Armor pieces will not drop as loot even if you can craft the Power Armor pieces, but they can be found via the random Power Amor Purchases from Murmrgh at The Rusty Pick. Players should only see Union Power Armor Pieces that they know how to craft drop from Purveyor's Mystery Picks. Pieces that they have yet to learn will not drop\n\nUnion Power Armor pieces will still have the Atomic Symbol on them and cannot be traded or dropped by players once they have been obtained.\n\n* **Workshop**: Player who had learned to build the Atlantic City Poker and Blackjack tables but lost access to them should now be able to build them again\n* **Test Your Metal**: Robot Beer Stein Display Case will now properly drop from the Test Your Metal Event\n* **Moonshine Jamboree** Improved an issue which could block enemy pathing during the event\n* **Fasnacht**: Masks of all tiers will correctly drop upon event completion\n* **Fasnacht**: Improved spawn rates of Honeybeasts\n* **Fasnacht**: Added a Donation Basket near the event! Share your repeat masks with other players\n* **Fasnacht**: Marchers now start walking to the parade start immediately when their task is completed, without needing to wait for their dialogue line to be finished\n* **Fasnacht**: Increased the walk speed of the Marchers\n* **Fasnacht**: Will now randomly pick between 5 possible end boss encounters\n* **Yao Guai Pastry**: Now counts as a cooked meal for the \"Eat a Cooked Meal\" challenge\n* Applying the Reflex Sight to the Enclave Pistol with a Flamer Barrel attachment now shows the Decrease in AP Consumption in the STATS Menu\n* Hot Rod On Blocks & Overgrown Vehicle no longer spawn damaging nuke explosions when destroyed\n* Fixed an issue which could cause players to get stuck while turning the spit in Meat Week\n* Fixed an issue with the Damage Reduction effect on the Endangerol Barrel that allowed it to stack multiple times on a target\n* Nuka Shank now requires glass & cloth to be crafted rather than oil\n* Updated mods for the Gauss shotgun, Gauss minigun and Gauss pistol to correctly require Science based perks to be applied\n* Updated the default barrel mod for the gauss rifle\n* Fixed an issue which could cause Fusion cores to appear empty when place in Power Armor\n* Players can now trade the Herdsman's Bell and Herdsman's Bell Rack to other players\n* Paddle Ball now displays the correct ammo type when inspected\n\n# Weapons\n\n* Increased the base damage of the Alien Blaster and Cryolator\n* Fixed an issue with how damage was calculated for the following weapons/mods: Auto Axe, Chainsaw, Minigun Shredder mod\n* Increased base damage for the Auto Axe\n* Adjustments to Electric/Electrified, Burning, and Poisoned mods for the following weapons: Auto Axe, Mr Handy Buzz Blade, Chinese Officer Sword,  Shepherds Crook, Sheepsquatch Staff, Sheepsquatch Club, Hatchet, Assaultron Blade, Revolutionary Sword, Baton, and Vault 63 Shock Baton.\n\n**Dev Note**: These weapon mods now evenly split their damage between Physical and Energy/Fire/Poison, and damage has been adjusted to account for damage being split between multiple damage types.\n\nThe Cattle Prod has also received a similar change - its damage has been adjusted and is evenly split between Physical and Energy damage. These adjustments generally represent an increase in damage dealt.\n\nWe have also improved how we calculate the falloff for weapon damage at range. We expect this to smooth out the falloff damage for weapons that historically lost most of their damage right away. All ranged weapons benefit from this, but it should be most visible with Shotguns and Pipe Guns, as well as when fighting larger creatures such as Deathclaws.\n\n# Localization\n\n* Fixed Various Typos\n* Fixed Some Dialogue\n\n# Quests\n\n* **Honor Bound** Fixed an issue where Vin could become hostile to the player\n* **One Violent Night**: Fixed an issue where the Nightstalker's VFX would be applied to players multiple times, creating an extremely intense effect\n* **\"Bots on Parade\" and \"A Real Blast\"** Fixed an issue that caused the objective to complete before the correct number of hostiles were defeated.\n* **\"Distant Thunder\"** Increased the objective radius to more accurately reflect the area in which Scorched can appear\n* **Hell's Eagles** Fixed an issue that would allow players to start the quest again after completion. We also removed the second broken quest from players in this situation\n* Regent of the Dead: Jordy no longer continuously starts dialogue with the player if the player exits dialogue with her before resolving the confrontation.\n* The quest Miner Miracles now starts correctly when interacting with the Garrahan Excavator Poster\n\n# UI\n\n* Items now display how much they will weigh when being placed in a character's stash\n* Score notification will no longer remain visible on ultra-wide monitors\n* Fixed an issue which would cause \"You have joined a team\" to remain visible on some super wide monitors\n* Added Height indicators for quest targets and NPCs to the Power Armor UI\n\n# World\n\n* Raider NPCs from the Coop will no longer spawn as legendary\n* The following creatures have received balance changes: Angler, Cave Cricket, Floaters, Gulper, Mutant Hound, Protectron\n\n# Miscellaneous\n\n* Fixed some dialog inconsistencies\n* Broken ProSnap Deluxe cameras will no longer appear in vendor inventories.\n* Fixed some directional prompts for Tax Evasion\n* Fixed an issue which could cause audio to cut out on some expeditions.\n* Green Thumb, Backwoodsman 4 and Verdant Season should now work on a broader selection of plants\n* Fixed an issue which would cause players to crash if they logged out during character generation\n* Fixed some cases where turret-mounted laser weapons weren't triggering the Electric Absorption perk\n* Updated \u201cComplete Any Expedition\u201d and \u201cComplete Any Atlantic City Expedition\u201d challenges to include the new Atlantic City mission from the America\u2019s Playground update",

The main benefit of 1st seems to be the permanent score boosts you get off the board. I hit 152 last season with what we assumed would be two weeks to spare. And I got 1st early May. But I cleared every daily and weekly list for the whole season. I used only one boost a week if I had any to get Saturday, Sunday and the remaining weekly challenges. It didn\u2019t feel like much of a grind for me because the daily list can usually be cleared in under an hour. \n\nI got everything I wanted off the board but there were several items I didn\u2019t get like Peepers paints and Devilish for PAs I don\u2019t use and I was able to buy around 500 perk points.",
