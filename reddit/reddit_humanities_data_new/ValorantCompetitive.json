            "xfferos lurks were terrible felt like rrq were fighting a 4v5 every round",
            "My two-word summary per map\n\nLotus: [MEEP MEEP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd2JgADY9d8&t=24s)\n\nAscent: Jett diff\n\nIcebox: Fake comeback",
            "Monyet is actually goated sometimes",
            "Frost pointed out preparing for the new patch while playing on the old patch was a massive pain point against PRX, so it\u2019s cool to see it come to fruition in a meaningful way against RRQ. Talon remains an incredibly solid regular season team.\n\nThere are still some real problems to fix for RRQ - I feel like I saw a mistake from xffero every 2 or 3 rounds - but all in all this was just a good series, for the most part. Some goofy rounds but for the most part this looked like the two teams fighting to see who currently sits in the fifth spot in Pacific, with maybe the potential to push up even further.",
            "my god talon I believed and you delievered. Funny the maps they won was the new duelists, talon experimentation seems to be going well, really like getting ban on duelist he's aggresive peaks work out so well. Monyet neon first map fucking slapped though almost made it a 2-0 for rrq.\n\nLets fucking go talon lets continue the series of wins. Also asurai is 0-3 for talon picks (one is them losing against ts, one is them winning against prx and one is today losing rrq) so holy fuck to that\n\nedit i slandered asurai he's 1-3 he predicted prx win against talon last week",
            "Monyet vs Valarante child game mechanics",
            "Iso and clove is disgusting",
            "There\u2019s just something about those Sheriff back of the head taps",
            "I actually predicted Talon to win in my pickems. Wooooo",
            "monyet being iso ulted out of his viper ult and losing the 1v1 due to ban's shield must be so fucking annoying",
            "Talon just needs to beat one of DFM/Zeta and they are locked for the playoffs I\u2019m pretty sure",
            "this map was hard to watch. xffero is one of the less intelligent (like decision making wise) players i have seen this vct season, they make so many throws and mistakes which could easily be avoided. he is good when taking gunfight duels however trophies are won with the brain which is the most powerful organ of the body.",
            "I'm a just-in-time compiled boy today\ud83e\udd76\ud83e\udd76\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e\u26a1\u26a1\u26a1",
            "Ban was barely positive with ISO, plus 90% of engagements his shield got timed out and had zero impact. I don't see anything that justifies the nerf.",
            "People hate on ban week after week why? \nConsistently creating a 5v4 round after round, especially on Ascent this series. Maybe overheats sometimes but stats don't show impact he's making - taking lines to recover a losing round, creating man advantage, consistently showing he can flex playing duelist+awp, sentinel, initiator, harbor, whatever the team needs.\n\nNow he did well and it's iso abuse... iso wasn't even great minus the last 2 clutch ults. Ban was aim diffing hard all series, his shield wasn't even up or an impact for a significant amount of kills on icebox. Sucks to see comments like ban was a \"mid iso\" or a bad pickup, guy was destroying on jett look at ascent 2nd half - especially pistol",
            "Xffero had a rly bad off day today",
            "There is honestly a crazy world where Talon wins pacific, if PRX wins today, Talon win out, and PRX loses to two of RRQ/DFM/Zeta division (plus DRX continue their bad map record)\n\nIncredibly unlikely, I especially don\u2019t see PRX losing even one of those games, but it\u2019s possible. 2nd place is marginally more realistic",
            "so talon needed a broken Iso and a new patch to be an \"incredibly solid team\" on icebox? If they lost on icebox today then what will be the next excuse? you could tell RRQ didnt know how to play against their comp but if any better teams face against them like DRX or GENG, they are definitely getting shitted all over. Also, Ban seems like a 'meh' iso imo,",
            "Let's fucking go. I think they need 1 more win to make playoffs minimum 2",
            "Thank fuck for another Viper counter, keep stacking them on and maybe she\u2019ll finally be unplayable for the next 100 years. Legit the worst agent to ever exist for spectators of pro val",
            "talon beating drx is most likely, drx very bad team",
            "This season not the best for him, usually very smart player",
            "It\u2019s more about his ranked dominance than pro play",
            "You must've been watching with your eyes closed. RRQ were falling back to time out the shield giving up insane amounts of space all time.",
            "this is like the ww2 plane thing. him simply turning on shield created so much space for 0 creds!",
            "Idk if this is an unpopular opinion or not but I think in pro play he wouldn\u2019t have pushed past the solid but niche tier even without the nerf. Raze/jett still just bring so much to the table.",
            "I don\u2019t think a T3 duelist is a good reference point for Iso being overpowered.",
            "How would they win pacific? They still need to go to playoffs and win there",
            "I\u2019m confused, did you mean to reply to someone else? You\u2019re arguing against a bunch of claims I haven\u2019t even seen anyone make, let alone make myself. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to have a strong Icebox to have be a strong regular season team, as Talon proved last split. Talon are not a strong Icebox team, RRQ are, so yeah, Talon went all-in on a new composition and it paid off. If Talon had lost, their prep would have not worked out. Why would an excuse be necessary?",
            "They are 5-2 overall in the regular season, they were an incredibly solid team before the patch",
            "just say u dont watch most pacific games, talon looked really solid last spkit delivering good matches against prx and geng",
            "if they cant win against dfm or zeta they dont im unfollowing this team",
            "maybe hes been munching on some lead sandwitches? those usually lead to cognitive degradation",
            "It's about his ranked dominance, but he's absolutely abusable in pro play",
            "I meant like regular season first place, mb lol kinda confusing",
            "From what I\u2019ve learned from watching Pacific is Talon just gets weirdly overhated, have been over-performing expectations and they still get hated on consistently.\n\nI\u2019d hate to see what people would be saying to them if they were performing to their expectations this year.",
            "Maybe"
