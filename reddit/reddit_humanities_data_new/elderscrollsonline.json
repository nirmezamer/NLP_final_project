            "## **[PC-EU]** **Grayskull**   \n*Social, Casual, Grouping, Events, PvE, Mixed*\n\n### Who we are\n**Grayskull** is a social guild of currently about 70 members with heavy focus on kindness and helpfulness. We are active and talk a lot in guild chat in game as well as use Discord and voice chat. We have a nice Guild House with plenty of accommodations such as a transmute station and trial dummies. Our guild consists of mainly older people (40s, 50s, 60s) but younger too, who just want to have fun playing the game and enjoy our time together. Helping each other out is a big part of our guild. We enjoy grouping up for any type of content.\n\n### What we do\nWe have Weekly Events ranging from Trials to Fashion events but it is all is pretty low key. There are no crazy requirements for most of the things we do as we play this game for fun and like to keep it fun *even when doing the harder content*. We gladly, and often do, take on lower levels and the more inexperienced players along on bigger events including trials. We just want everyone to have fun and be able to enjoy *all* forms of content in this game. We don't expect anyone to be in the top 1%. Don't expect to see any form of rage-quitting, namecalling, etc if something does not go as planned. We are generally calm and patient and will simply try again. We run content every day like pledges, RND, veteran dungeons, trials, achievement runs, or anything else when and if there's a want for it.\n\n### What we are\nWe are not a hardcore raiding or trading guild, but we sure are a *fun* guild. So if you're looking for a place to feel at home just give us a call. Your skill or level does not matter. You could be new to the game or a veteran player just looking for a change. We have people from all walks of life and skill and will happily add you to our ranks if you resonate with the above.\n\nYou can apply by contacting me here, or by whispering `@WildCatra` or `@Noble-Bear` in-game."

            "People sometimes forget that when ESO launched, set amulets and rings were rather scarce.  There was no way to craft your own, which is why sets such as Willpower and Agility were popular in builds, so getting a blue necklace for a quest reward wasn't entirely terrible (although, as Cadwell himself admits, it's hardly a suitable reward.) \n\nWith no dark anchors in Coldharbour, if I am remembering correctly, the only other way to get jewelry for this set was via treasure chests, and one certain delve boss dropped a green-quality necklace.\n\nAlso, the Meridia's Blessed Armor (originally Akatosh) set was not craftable, and only available from Coldharbour,  It was a decent set: blocking an enemy gives you a 33% chance to blind them, causing them to miss all attacks against you for 5 seconds, with a 10 second cooldown.  It could only be applied to one target at a time, though.  This was later changed to give you 100% chance to avoid all incoming attacks for 5 seconds when blocking, with a 25 second cooldown.",

That\u2019s also why the crown store artifact styles explicitly state that they\u2019re replicas. \n\n[You can see a bunch of them at the bottom of this UESP page in the \u201cDropped Artifacts\u201d section.](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Artifacts)",

            "Literally stuck in PVP circles",
            "It is really weird how they handled this because while it makes sense IRL (let gamers experience all zones), in-game it becomes... Confusing. AfaIk Meridia sends you back in time and masks who you are so no one will know your identity, yet my AD character chatted with Lerisa in Alik'r who knew all about how I defeated Molag Bal...\n\nAnd what exactly is happening when you travel back to the zones? Enemies are still hostile so do you go back in time? But I'm pretty sure a lot of new DLC content have you go through old zones in prologue quests...",
            "AfaIk Meridia says they will not recognize who you are, but the Vestige still remembers everything that happened (it is brought up during quests), so you're still knowingly mowing down your own people/allies from before Meridia sends you to the other alliance zones.",
            "I am still in disbelief over what happened in Shadowfen, it is so out of nowhere and waaay more extreme than what any other alliance does. I'm AD on my main but I still slaughtered them... I mean, Argonian genocide? Really?",
            "Bleakrock Isle was an inside job",
            "This all predates one tamriel where the only overland/ player access you had was to your own alliance. This way you could play through each alliance WITHOUT having to make a new toon. For the way the game was designed at launch it was a conveinant feature, now a bit redundant..",
            "I think (based on the dialogue when you start silver) that it's basically a dream, you're seeing the war through the eyes of the other alliance heroes who served your role but weren't the vestige. but yeah, its... not well done, because you weren't able to do that on release. it was patched in afaik and it seems they genuinely just slapped on a script to start the next alliance zone when you accepted the silver or gold, and didn't even think about just... not having the dialogue as if you've already met them. either that or even worse, they added in dialogue for you already knowing them and thought that was fine. I'm not sure what the thought process was, honestly. I just definitely think there was a better way to handle it, haha.",
            "See, I chose to interpret that as the Vestiage remembers everything *afterwards*. The point of Cadwells Silver/Gold was to show you a that could've been scenario and that loses the impact if the Vestiage is aware she's essentially in the theme park version. So each time you do everything for the 'first' time (including the main quest, guild quests, Coldharbour etc) until you reach Cadwell and remember again.\n\n\nAfter Gold Meridia does something to make so each of the timelines happened (akin to a Dragonbreak) and you have the full knowledge of all three timelines.\n\n\n(This is something I've played with in some unpublished fanworks where Darien keeps semi-remembering the Vestiage due to his connection with Meridia)",
            "the pact and covenant are committing acts of war in the other territories, but the dominion are straight up committing atrocities. \n\nAyrenn is going around trying to play diplomat whilst her troops are on the other side of the globe attempting multiple genocides, does she even know wtf is happening on her own front?",
            "I once had a Greymire Argonian give the \u201cI spit in Ayrenn\u2019s eye\u201d bark, and it made me laugh a lot more that it should have",
            "For sure\u00a0",
            "Yeah it doesn't really work at all. I guess they want it to be sort of a \"what if you woke up in X alliance zone instead of your original.\n\nHowever, it really doesn't work, even as a dream. Duing Cadwell's silver/gold I got to Betnikh, where you have a quest with Ayleid ghosts. One of them comments about me:\n\n*\"Living and yet without a soul. How can this be?\"***Not exactly. It would take too long to explain.**\"\n\nSo... My vestige KNOWS what happened and that he technically has his soul back? Yet a lot of the quests are all about how \"only someone without a soul can do this\". Did Meridia take my soul and put it back? Twice for silver and gold???\n\nThe way it is done it feels like it cannot be a dream because my character knows what happened before and Lerisa knows who I am when I talk to her in a bar in Alik'r:\n\n*\"Don't think I haven't heard about your exploits. Rumors abound.* ***You've toppled Daedric Princes, defeated armies, saved more people than I can count.***  \n***One day soon, I'll be saying \"I knew you when\".***\n\nThe whole thing is so messy...",
            "The Vestige remembers everything during the journey, not just afterwards. Here is dialogue from an Ayleid spirit during the Betnikh quest:\n\n\\*\"Living and yet without a soul. How can this be?\"\\***Not exactly. It would take too long to explain.**\"\n\nThis dialogue option popped up for my AD character that had finished the Coldharbour MQ. So... My Vestige KNOWS what happened and that he technically has his soul back. (Yet a lot of the quests are all about how \"only someone without a soul can do this\". Did Meridia take my soul and put it back? Twice for silver and gold???)\n\nAlso, Lerisa knows who I am when I talk to her in a bar in Alik'r:\n\n*\"Don't think I haven't heard about your exploits. Rumors abound.*\u00a0***You've toppled Daedric Princes, defeated armies, saved more people than I can count. One day soon, I'll be saying \"I knew you when\".***\n\nSo not only does the Vestige remember everything, other people know who you are and what you have done. It's really confusing and messy. It feels like Meridia sends you back in time, so that way you have 3 Vestiges running around, the original one and two that Meridia sent to the other alliance zones.\n\nHowever, that also makes things confusing, because how do other character view you? When you get to High Isle and meet Ayrenn, Emeric and Jorunn, would they see the same Vestige? For Ayrenn you are the person who went to Coldharbour, for Emeric you are a DC hero who went away after the Bangkorai MQ, same with Jorunn except it is the pact and the Rift MQ.\n\nI suppose a Dragon Break could smooth things over but it still feels odd that there are essentially three versions of you as a player character.",
            "I\u2019m pretty sure Ayrenn didn\u2019t know about any of that. If you sneak around instead of running in guns blazing, some of the soldiers make hints about it being a Veiled Heritance order.\n\nStill, them soldiers gotta die for going through with it.",
            "Isn't canonically there are thousands of vestiges in the world in that time? You just happen to be the ONE who defeated Molag Bal. While others did their adventures in other zones. \nAt least that's how ZOS explain how everything has happened in the very same year. Also Chapter trailers with different main characters (Morrowind Warden, Blackwood Imperial, Dark Elf Arkanist, etc.) kinda support that.",
            "See? This is why I haven't even touched the Silver & Gold quests. It just looked janky from square one. I couldn't figure out how they would pull off the concept without it sucking & everything I have heard about it - says they failed. So now I have a 2 tier quest chain I have no interest in following......  *sigh*",
            "However,.you're also meeting characters for the first time.\n\n\nI just ignore the dialogue oddities because my explanation makes more sense.",
            "This makes sense\n\nIt was jarring to say the least for Ayrenn\u2019s army to genuinely be committing open acts of genocide and Ayrenn to be very nice.\n\nI started off as EP as an Argonian and absolutely wanted to destroy the entirety of the AD for what they did in Shadowfen thinking the whole faction and every leader was equally as evil.",
            "I guess so? As I understood it there are three Vestiges, your original Vestige that went to Coldharbour to face Molag Bal, then the two versions of you that are sent back in time to the other zones. After that I suppose there is a dragon break tying all three versions back into one?\n\nAs for the trailers, I'm not sure, I know they are meant to be player characters, but if those are specifically the Vestige is another matter.",
            "Nah explaining everything with Dragon Break is a bad taste nowadays. Maybe there is some of Meridia's magic involved, but definitely not a Dragon Break."
