            "If you are still on the fence about casting a protest ballot in the 2024 election by voting for a third party let's be crystal clear about a few things:\n\n1. A Third party cannot win in the United States, so long as the Electoral College exists.\n2. If a party doesn't get a 50% +1 majority in the EC, the House of representatives picks the president, which mean the party that controls the House picks the president.\n3. If one of the most popular presidents in American history, Theodore Roosevelt, couldn't win a THIRD TERM as a third party candidate, literally no-one can.\n\nSo with those sobering stone-cold facts out of the way here's why a protest vote is shooting off your foot to spite your face: ***The Supreme Court are Lifetime Appointments. AND WILL GOVERN MILLENNIALS POLITICAL LIVES FOR THE REST OF OUR POLITICAL RELEVANCE.***\n\nWhatever issues you care about: Voter Protection. Gun Regulations. Immigrant Protections. Abortion. Universal Basic Income. Workers Rights. Minority Rights. LGBT Rights. Interracial Marriage Rights. Contraception Rights. Fair Tax policy. Whatever it is, will ultimately be decided at the SCOTUS. Period. Fullstop.\n\nThe Scotus is currently occupied by a super majority of Right-Wing, Pro-Corporate, Anti-Progressive activist judges. 6-3. The next presidential term, 2024-2028, it is entirely possible we will see one, if not two, of these justices step down and or die in office. (end of next presidential term)\n\n* ***Justice Thomas, 75 (79)***\n* ***Justice Alito, 73. (77)***\n* Justice Sotomayor, 69. (73)\n* Chief Justice Roberts, 69. (77)\n* Justice Kagan, 63. (67)\n* Justice Kavanaugh, 58. (62)\n* Justice Gorsuch, 56. (60)\n* Justice Jackson, 53. (63)\n\nAll those protest votes against Hillary Clinton (if there were any) in 2016 gave us THREE lifetime appointments of ultra Right-Wing, Pro-Corporate, Anti-Progressive activist judges who will easily be on the court for the next 20+ years.\n\nIf the GOP is allowed to appoint TWO more ultra Right-Wing, Pro-Corporate, Anti-Progressive activist judges, our fate as a generation to enact ANY change is practically over. You could elect Bernie Sanders or AOC in 2028 and it won't matter if you have a supermajority conservative activist judge SCOTUS for the next 20+ years.\n\nTo be frank, this sh\\*t matters. Elections matter. The next two election cycles aren't a time to F\\*ck around with third-party fantasies. Maybe one day we'll achieve a multi-party system that can work for all of us. It ain't gonna happen with a Ultra-Conservative Supermajority SCOTUS.\n\nUtilize your power to vote accordingly; Especially if you are a voter in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Minnesota or Georgia.",

I had to start looking up places out of state while telling my wife everything would be okay even though I didn\u2019t actually know if that were true because if they were ectopic then I had to know where we could go.

            "Allowing the agreement between Saudi Arabia and the US for the \"petro\" dollar will go down as one of the worst things to happen to our country in our life times. \n\nCountries are bolstered by what value they provide to other countries, usually by their exports. The US has minimal exports. The The three things we had going for us was:  \n1) that Oil was traded in USD, so other countries were forced to get USD to be able to buy oil,   \n2) Culture, Movies, music, TV shows, etc. I lived in Europe in the early 2000's for a couple of years, and Everything was \"American this\" and \"american that\" clothing stores, music stores, etc. They ate up our culture. Now our big name stars hate our country, Even flying the American flag is seen as extremist behavior, that only \"the far right\" would dare do such a thing. Our culture is fucked, the movies we make suck and nobody wants to watch them, our music is bad, and often anti American.   \n3) the last thing we have is Military. So war is the last thing we can do to prop up our country. Who's ready to go to war? \n\nif you don't think it is eminent, men are now automatically registered for the draft, and they are trying to require [women to register for the draft](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/06/27/requirement-women-register-draft-back-table-annual-defense-bill.html). \n\n  \nI know it is seen as insane to support an \"America first\" policy, but at this point if we don't do something, our country will have no other solution than to throw bodies at the bullets of \"their\" enemies, whom ever they decide that is. are you ready for it? \n\nIf I was in power, it would be energy. I would invest HEAVILY into modern nuclear power plants, Make them small, make them efficient. Offer to build them on/near every military base we have, and sell that power to the countries they are in, sell it cheap. Make it so that we power even the poorest countries in a manner that allows them to evolve past the polluting methods of farming and energy generation they do now. It would support electric vehicles of all types as well. It would do a lot to combat global warming, give our country something that we could sell to the rest of the world, and put our interest first.",

            "On Shifting Right\n\nIn the chrysalis of time, a caterpillar dreams,\n\nEmerging as wisdom, where once were youthful schemes.\n\nI'm about to be 30 and thus, one of the\u00a0youngest millennials. This means that soon, there won't be any more of us in our twenties.\u00a0They call your twenties are called the \"defining decade.\" Your thirties are when we put our life together, start families, and settle down. So how does life shape our ideas?\u00a0Recently, this sub has seen a lot of talk about how individuals tend to shift to the right when they age. So as the last millennials exit their twenties, let's explore this phenomenon.\n\nThe notion that individuals tend to become more conservative as they age is an idea with deep roots. This phenomenon has been observed across various cultures and eras, suggesting a universal human tendency. The expression, \"If you're not a liberal when you're young, you have no heart; if you're not a conservative when you're old, you have no brain,\" captures the essence of this shift, though admittedly it oversimplifies the complexity of human development and ideological evolution.\n\n\nHistorically, the youthful embrace of liberal ideas can be attributed to idealism and a desire for change. Young people, unburdened by significant personal responsibilities and buoyed by optimism, are naturally inclined toward progressive ideals. They seek to challenge the status quo, driven by a vision of a better, more equitable world. This idealism is often tempered by the realities of life as we grow older. This reminds me of my own na\u00efvet\u00e9\u00a0when in my high-school physics class I thought I could use magnets and a flywheel to discover perpetual motion and solve world hunger.\n\n\nAs we age, our perspectives tend to shift. The responsibilities of adulthood\u2014career, family, financial stability\u2014bring a new set of priorities. The once-appealing radical changes now seem risky, threatening the hard-earned stability. This is where the \"brain\" aspect of the aphorism comes into play. With age comes a recognition of the complexities and trade-offs inherent in societal change. The desire for stability often outweighs the youthful drive for revolutionary change.\n\n\nMoney also plays a role in this ideological shift to varying degrees. As people accumulate wealth and assets, they become more invested in the status quo. Conservative policies, which often emphasize economic stability, low taxes, and property rights, become more attractive. The preservation of wealth and the security of investments become paramount concerns. This financial conservatism aligns with broader conservative principles, reinforcing the ideological shift.\n\n\nEncountering the limitations of idealistic policies firsthand, witnessing the unintended consequences of well-meaning but flawed initiatives, and understanding the value of prudence and caution\u2014all these factors play a part in this transformation.\u00a0\n\nNot everyone encounters this shift.\u00a0Many individuals maintain their youthful liberalism throughout their lives, driven by a deep-seated commitment to social justice and equality. For those who have been left behind economically, the shift to conservatism may not follow the same trajectory. Economic disenfranchisement can foster a sense of disillusionment with the status quo, perpetuating a commitment to progressive or even more radical ideologies. These folks might continue to advocate for systemic change, driven by a perception that the existing structures have failed them.\u00a0For many, a just society is one that provides a safety net for those without a clear path to prosperity.",
            "You do realize Joe Biden currently leads Donald Trump by less than five percentage points among voters under 45, don't you? What makes you think you're even talking to a progressive audience?\n\nDonald Trump is not qualified, Joe Biden is outright dangerous, and the reverse is also true! I have no intention of making my third party vote a protest ballot. I intend to vote for Kennedy because I want him to be president. That he is not having a successful campaign is not that important to me. I vote in a state that picks the exact same party, every single time. My vote has never made a difference in a single election I've voted for. This one will be no different. My money is a different matter.\n\nMuch more importantly, I think we can stop either a President Trump or a President Biden from destroying the country or world, respectively. This country has done both. It can do it again. I'd rather not have to wage that kind of uphill battle that comes with having a president who is extremely toxic and dangerous, but it would be far from my first rodeo. I'm not so scared I can be blackmailed into casting a fear vote for either of them.\n\n>If a party doesn't get a 50% +1 majority in the EC, the House of representatives picks the president, which mean the party that controls the House picks the president.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned that's an argument in favor of a third party vote. We \\*say\\* the presidency is winner-take-all. I'm not convinced. The weaker the electoral showing, the weaker the mandate, the weaker the president. If this is the best result I can get, I'd rather have that than Biden winning the electoral vote, and I'd much rather have that than Trump winning he electoral vote.\n\nOut of many, many, many issues that could matter, the composition of the Supreme Court is of only medium importance to me. The Supreme Court was conservative-moderate when I became an adult, and now it's moderate-conservative. I think that's an improvement. There have been conservative decisions over the past 6-odd years, and there have been progressive decisions. It's mostly good. If anything I think obsessing over the Supreme Court is part of what's destabilizing the country. No matter which side \"wins\" they're never satisfied, and every time a side \"loses\" they moan and wail as if it's the end of the world. The only Supreme Court decision in my memory I can think of that I think has actually helped me is the one that punished same-sex sexual harassment in the workplace.",
            "There's no perfect place, but I think the US being the largest English speaking country in the world, and English being the default second language in most of the world, means our media and thus our issues are broadcasted to the world.\n\nIn contrast, not many people are aware of Finland's internal issues because almost no one speaks Finnish outside of Finland.",
            "Evaluated and invested in prisons.",
            "The amount you receive in Social Security each month is based off your highest earning years. The current income cap is $168,600/yr.\n\nSomeone with an income of $168,600/yr is going to receive a bigger social security check than someone with an income of $60,000/yr. Someone with an income of $300,000/yr will receive the exact same social security check as someone who only has an income of $168,600.\n\nThe common idea that I hear from the Left is to tax higher income earners more. But they don\u2019t want those who are taxed more to receive more.\n\nSocial security has been a horrible idea since its inception. Most of us currently contributing to it will never see a dime if it when we retire. There are those (currently receiving it) that complain that it\u2019s not enough. Typically, the people making this argument are very low income-earners who spent DECADES ignoring the writing in the wall, and never invested a single penny in preparation for retirement.\n\nEarlier this year, my 18 year old nephew came to me to learn how to make a budget. One of the things I made very clear to him was to contribute to his 401k starting right now. Even if he starts with 3% of his income, and increase it by 1% each year. I told him Social Security isn\u2019t gonna cut it.",
            ">You do realize Joe Biden currently leads Donald Trump by less than five percentage points among voters under 45\n\nYou mean in the polls that have been wrong for nearly a decade when it comes to people under 45? The same polls that have been wrong by about 5 points in favor of conservatives? You're overstating.  \n\n\n>What makes you think you're even talking to a progressive audience?\n\nWell, in the same polls you cite, those positions are overwhelmingly popular (approaching 60%, 70% even 80% favorability) in the under 45 demographic. Yes, Millennials are overwhelmingly in favor of progressive policies, whether or not you agree with that or not. Check the polls you cite. Sure they might not like Biden (who isn't a progressive BTW) but they looooove progressive policy.  \n\n\n>As far as I'm concerned that's an argument in favor of a third party vote.\n\nIt isn't. It's crystal clear proof that a third party cannot win in the US.  \n\n\n>We \\*say\\* the presidency is winner-take-all. I'm not convinced. \n\nIt's a political fact. If the POTUS doesn't win 50%+1, then the House of Representatives (aka the house that holds a simple majority of the house) picks the POTUS. Sorry, the math doesn't agree with you.\n\nIf Theodore Roosevelt, one of the most popular American presidents in history, couldn't win a third term running as a third-party...no-one can.  \n\n\n> the composition of the Supreme Court is of only medium importance to me. \n\nThey you don't understand power.  \n\n\n>The Supreme Court was conservative-moderate when I became an adult, and now it's moderate-conservative.\n\nIt's a ludicrous proposition to think the current court is \"moderate-conservative\". It's a far-right court, at best. Roe vs. Wade was the **moderate** position on abortion. They overturned it. That's Right-Wing. It ain't close to moderate.   \n\n\n>The only Supreme Court decision in my memory I can think of that I think has actually helped me is the one that punished same-sex sexual harassment in the workplace.\n\nExactly. Most of the Supreme court decisions that helped you were in the past, those are being undone by this current ultra right-wing court.",
            "\"They you don't understand power.\"\n\n\nI understand your post to be an argument that there is a mythical silver bullet to power.\n\n\nThat is simply not true in the United States. Our system of government is extremely complex. Power changes and flows fast over short periods of time, but slowly over long periods of time.\n\n\nThe current Supreme Court split is three solid conservatives (I place Barrett in this category), one moderate conservative (Roberts) three solid liberals, and two idiosyncratic conservatives. Not much different than the Rehnquist/O'Connor/Kennedy Court.",
            ">is a mythical silver bullet to power.\n\nThere is nothing mythical about it. Right now the ultra-right-wing SCOTUS is undoing 100 years of settled law, regulations. This is a fact. This is judicial power that Republicans have invested and gamed the system to gain. And any changes to the system will have to flow through that stacked ultra-conservative SCOTUS. \n\nThere's nothing mythical about this, this is a stone-cold reality.\n\nYou seem to misunderstand the entire crux of my argument. It IS NOT: let's stack the court and then we will win. On the contrary my argument is: if we allow them to stack the court there is no way we can win.  \n\n\n>Power changes and flows fast over short periods of time, but slowly over long periods of time.\n\nA laughable statement, with objective reality proving otherwise.  \n\n\n>The current Supreme Court split is three solid conservatives, three solid liberals, and two idiosyncratic conservatives.\n\nAbsolutely hilarious. \n\nThomas - Ultra conservative.  \nAlito - Ultra conservative.  \nBarret - Ultra conservative.  \nRoberts - Solid Conservative.  \nGorsuch - Solid Conservative.  \nKavanah - Solid Conservative.  \nKagan - Soild Moderate.  \nSotomayor - Solid Liberal.  \nJackson - Solid Liberal.\n\nIt's not even close to a moderate court dude. Not even close. In no universe is this court evenly balanced. The overturning of Roe vs. Wade is proof of that my man. Roe vs. Wade **WAS THE MODERATE POSITION.** Overturning it, is a heavily Right-Wing position. Guess what? that ruling was 5-4, with Roberts taking the moderate position despite being solidly conservative. \n\nTexas' Bounty Hunter abortion case (Whole Women's Health v. Jackson).  \n Arkansas NAACP v. Arkansas PPP.   \nTrump v. United States.\n\nThe list of untra-right-wing case decisions is overwhelming. It's frankly inarguable."

You can see examples of this with popular pop punk bands like CuteIsWhatWeAimFor or The Academy Is, The Ready Set*, Forever the Sickest Kids, etc.\n\nIt was a very popular cut pre-Bieber. It\u2019s just something old people noticed once he came around and then claimed everybody copied him.\n\n(Sorry I\u2019ve been waiting for an opportunity to make this rant for at least 15 years)",

I'm losing the weight I packed on during covid after the deaths of my dad and grandma, and after getting to my goal weight then hitting the gym for a few months, I'm finally going to drop the money on surgery to remove loose skin and get a breast lift. Also planning on Lasik eye surgery so I can get rid of my glasses. \n\nMy childhood was awful, grew up in an abusive home. My 20s and early 30s were full of more abuse and toxic romantic relationships that have taken a LONG time to heal from. I have a wonderful husband now, a stable life, and I'm taking back my life in my 40s! My husband and I are planning to visit Japan, which has been a lifelong dream, so I think that's the perfect way to kick off the best decade of my life.

If you have mental health issues, find help and a framework. If you are overweight and want to lose or you\u2019re out of shape and want to get it back, do it today. I did it at 37 before being essentially sedentary for a couple years and doing it again at 43 is a lot rougher.\n\nPay attention to cardio. Cultivate at least one vice - pfas and microplastics are gonna give you cancer, you may as well aim for a cool cancer. Cultivate at least two hobbies, one indoor and one out of possible. Get ten minutes of sun or equivalent light a day. Eat fibre and drink water.\n\nCultivate only relationships that fulfill you and don\u2019t have too many that don\u2019t challenge you. \n\nGet right with your past, learn to forgive yourself. \n\nStop stressing: things generally work out okay in the end and the only problem you really have to worry about is the very last one, and that one is your next of kin\u2019s problem.

You are them and cant be anybody else. Once you are ok with who you are, decide what parts you want to move on from to make who you were and what parts you want to emphasize or add to make who you will be.\n\nAfter that, be open to life and do the work.
