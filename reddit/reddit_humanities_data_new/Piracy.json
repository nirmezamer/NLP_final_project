And how would they do that if it's a free service you may ask. They collect your data and sell it off to whoever wants to buy it (Ad agencies, data brokers, government, foreign powers etc). Remember using a VPN doesn't really make you anonymous or increase privacy like the ads say they do. Your ISP may not be able to see exactly what you're doing, but the VPN provider or whoever is hosting the servers can. ISP's must follow whatever the law is in your country of residence. Not so for VPN providers as they can be in any country and follow whatever laws they have there, or it could be an outright scam and literally just be there to harvest data from people looking for a free VPN provider. Personally I wouldn't touch a free VPN at all. I'm very picky with my provider,  if I can't trust them there is no point in using the service in the first place. Be careful and stay safe.",

So many games they wanted, played on an emulator for 4 minutes and never touched again.\n\nHowever, it also allows me to expose them to ALL the games, and then we can buy the ones they actually enjoy, for airplanes or long car rides or even when my 10 year old wants to be broody in his room.\n\nPrincess Peach: Showtime is a perfect example, neither of my boys expressed interest in it, but loved it and I own a copy.\n\nMario vs DK- exact opposite, they really wanted it, even enjoyed the  demo, but the game got 0 play on the emulator.\n\nI don't get how Nintendo doesn't see this, and that's not even touching on the 30 years of games that there is no current way to play.",
