This has prompted me to start dueling with my friends again as we all are \u201cnew\u201d to this again (like we have no idea what link monsters are, and I just found out what pendulum monsters are because I am watching that anime) so with monsters effects do we have to tell them the monster effects before they attack the monster or do they have to attack to them find out the effect? Like watching the show they know monster effects until AFTER they attack the monster and trigger said effect. I feel it doesn\u2019t make much sense if you know my monster makes you monster lose attack points if you attack it, before you attack it, then you would just never attack my monster. Do I have to tell them the effect before they trigger it or after it\u2019s triggered?",

I would say that LADD can of course not activate its negating effect to negate Metalmorph's initial activation (was activated during my MPI, when LADD was still face-down), but during the Damage Calculation LADD is face up and that's just when Metalmorph's mandatory effect activates on which LADD's negating effect can be chained on, meaning it can negate its ATK boost of 1400 ATK for only this certain attack.

            "This will have to depend on what a judge rules. The OCG text of Defense Zone only protects cards in the S/T zone, rather than S/T themselves, so OCG rulings are not applicable in that case.\n\nI personally would say yes for TCG, based on how the TCG text is worded, but obviously, for OCG and Master Duel, the answer is no.",

            "It's just because it's an older card. Older cards often had to explain their mechanics since they were new mechanics at the time, same as how contact fusion monsters used to say \"(you do not use Polymerization)\"\n\nAfter a while I guess they assume everyone knows how it works",

Monster Cards, including Pendulum Monster Cards, are always treated as monsters unless they're either in the Spell & Trap Zone or attached to an Xyz Monster as material.\n\n>to further this question, if the effect tells me to special summon the monster i draw, but the monster says that it cannot be special summoned, what happens?\n\nDepends on the specific effect. I will say that the effect won't be negated unless the word \"negate\" is explicitly used: just because an effect didn't work properly doesn't mean the effect was negated.\n\n>were pendelum zones themselves removed/conjoined with 2 of the spell slots with the addition of link monsters?\n\nYes. As of 2017, the Pendulum Zones are no longer their own distinct zones.\n\n>can you summon a pendelum monster into a monster zone?\n\nSure.\n\n>if so, does it keep the effect at the bottom? or does that only apply if it is in a spell zone? also, the effect between the pendelum levels, does that only register in the spell and pendelum zones?\n\nWhile the card is in the Pendulum Zone, you only use the effects in the top box, not the bottom box. While the card is treated as a monster, you only use the effects in the bottom box, not the top box.\n\n>can a pendelum monster be attacked if it is in a pendelum zone? can a pendelum monster attack if it is in a pendelum zone?\n\nNo to both questions. Spells cannot attack or be attacked.",

Fourth would be Blue Eyes, because it's just a fun deck for beginners and casuals, sure you will be beaten plot by meta with this, but it's a great deck to start out the game with. Fifth would be Cyberse, due to the cracked staples of Linkuriboh, Pre-Errata firewall, and Accesscode Talker.

            "Maybe he didn't lose because he actually a good Deck compared to the other protagonists? This is Vrains after all.\n\nThe other protagonists literally have some of the jankiest Decks of all time that if you play IRL, you would be guaranteed to brick 9/10 times, but smh Yusaku has a stronger plot armor?\n\nIf you wanna speak about plot armor, Yusei doesn't have any loss either (he crashed just before losing to Kiryu). Anytime he was about to lose, an \"unexpected\" event had to happen so he doesn't lose. Do I have to mention him winning a relay 1v3 because his opponent couldn't bring themselves to simply pass their turn to make him Deckout?\n\nYugi doesn't even bother to check the card he drew before placing it in the S/T zone. Sure would have been awkward if it was a Monster. Judai was in a situation where he couldn't Summon any Level 4 or lower monsters, and was against a monster that reduces his Fusions' ATK to 0. Topdecks Neos while also having Necroshade in the GY. Talk about luck.\n\nYuma literally transforms his cards mid duel. Yuya gets his first Fusion monster mid Duel too.\n\nBut sure, the one with an actual competent Deck in the Anime is the one to have more plot armor, right?",
            "You I never thought of summoning baronne.well I didn't know of the card when I played synchrons and I was usually trying to summon shooting qusar dragon or ended up satellite warrior or clear, crystal Wing synchro dragon.",
            "Arguably, Soulburner has an even bigger plot armor than Playmaker. A card that stops effect damage that is 300 or lower and a pseudo-Super Poly against a Trickstar player.\n\nAlso, Salamangreat Kernel, the biggest \"fuck you Revolver\" card against said Duelist."
