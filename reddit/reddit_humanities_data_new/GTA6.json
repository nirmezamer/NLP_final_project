Most games nowadays when taking images in photomode it automatically puts it in your consoles gallery, which I then can seamlessly transfer to my hard drive, then to my Laptop.",
            "Over the weekend I got the itch to play GTA5 online. But I was suddenly reminded why I dont play it that much. Tried to do the Cayo Perico heist and it froze on loading screens back to my sub three times. Finally I just exited out and played something else. Coming from playing a lot of MMO's I love the concept of GTA online and would play it a WHOLE LOT more if it wasn't so buggy and the menus were such garbage. I obviously played it a lot more when it was newer (2013-2017). But slowly stopped playing it regularly due to difficulty loading into sessions or trying to join a friends session then getting kicked.  I've still popped in for updated content here and there but its always the same. Start playing it, convince other gamer friends to join and eventually we all get frustrated with kicks, freezing loading screens or just game breaking bugs in general. I've always said I would be happy to pay a $5-$15 monthly fee if that meant R\\* would actually maintain their servers. I know a lot of people, especially in this type of game genre would absolutely scoff at the idea. But coming from MMO's where its either pay to win or has a monthly sub, I would have no issues with a monthly sub whatsoever. Again, given its less pay to win and the servers aren't complete dog s\\*\\*\\*. \n\nAlso did I mention the menu system in GTA5 online is also hot garbage? Game matching menus included. I hope they fix that too.",

It would be comical to hear him comment on how Vice City has (not) changed since the 80s.\n\nI know he left Rock Star, but the game has been in production for so long. It might be possible that they have already recorded all they need before his departure. Or maybe they just temporarily hired him for the radio shows.",

But you should be able to get in and out rather that it be just a part of the story. \u00a0Or maybe you have a characters in prison the whole time that you can fast switch to (like in gta5. )\n\nThe prison would have a high fidelity simulation of gangs and activities like lifting weights sending secret messages and buying and selling contraband etc, raids, etc. \u00a0you would have a cell/locker for large items as well as a butt innovatory for small items and weapons.",
            "Its needs actual Police dogs",

If the online mode is executed well enough it could have a lifespan two or three times compared to GTAVs, I truly think they are going to go all out with the online side of the game and deliver something that has abit of everything for everyone.

There are a lot of very old games (especially RPG games) that had way more advanced creator than some modern gen games.   \n  \nThem abandoning RDRO after couple of years cause it wasn't generating enough profit is also completely irrelevant to what character creator they added to the game at launch. Ridiculous argument.   \n  \nWhat's relevant is what kind of customization are they willing to implement to their own engine and character creator. RDRO character creator was better and more advanced than GTAO creator. Just like GTAVIO creator will be more advanced and better than RDRO creator.

Character creator needs to be user friendly and appeal to the general audience. If you overload people with this kind of UI and give them more options than a professional program for graphic designers most people would get overwhelmed. \n\nThat's why most games have character creator more similar to Cyberpunk of Fallout.

There is a vanilla server loading screen, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen server owners who develop their own loading screens. The rest is stuff that happens in the background. Cfx does not make RP scripts. They make a few basic ones that support the server infrastructure, and OneSync. \n\nNothing else, sorry. *Rockstar* literally risks infringement if they decide to copy anything a server does to the point a judge would agree.\n\n> second life\n\nI\u2019m a PC gamer, but this statement is just blue-skying.

Wouldn't want SixM to release right after the new online releases or all these players already on FiveM will move over there instead of playing actual 6 Online where they buy shark cards. It's difficult to stop a big modding project like that - especially without major community backlash - but buying them is much easier, lets them make sure they don't release another competitor to the official servers any time soon, all the while winning goodwill from the community.",
            "Yes, but all that costs time and money and occupies the time of developers that are very expensive to pay. Servers like nopixel have features like that because their profit centers are slightly different and the folks working on it are probably passion taxed to hell and back, in addition to likely not having a way to see what the actual overhead is in respect to revenue. \n\nIf it don\u2019t make dollars, it don\u2019t make sense.

            "What about her being in gta iv dating website? Idk if that's really her but it really sounded like her because she describes her being on witness protection and her life being boring because of it",
            "Don't worry bro, no problem here :)",
            "they'll still play the game one handed while staring at Lucia they can deny it all they want lmao.",
            "Or sarcasm.",
            "Okay ty",
            "Yeah but that basic good character writing is what lacked in GTA V and part of that is because of the three characters system too. You don\u2019t get to feel as much for any one of them individually and immerse yourself in their world because your attention is pulled in three different directions with three different backgrounds and somewhat conflicting motives. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m young or not well read like you\u2019re suggesting. Many people agree that V was just a lot more \u201csurface level\u201d compared to the older games, and not just IV.",
            "I\u2019m not saying they weren\u2019t goofy, IV has goofy aspects too. But there\u2019s definitely topics that they used to make social and political commentary on that they don\u2019t really touch anymore.",
            "Yeah,  it seems like lucia will be a snake",
            "Red dead 2 had a good ( well better ending )",
            "Two wrongs don't make a right",
            "Yeah but Michael said he was stopping",
            "LOL it\u2019s okay I should\u2019ve added a comma before I posted",
            "What make michael enraged was the fact she fucked the coach on his house and his bed. They had an agreement to not do anything inside the house.",
            "I never knew that Michael cheated first. This changes my whole entire perspective on Amanda.",
            "I mean even if that was the case, getting revenge for cheating by cheating is a bad tactic",
            "I thought it meant serious",
            "I'm not talking about you specifically, I was talking more broadly, and a lot of that is based on my experience on the RDR2 sub where people act like Arthur Morgan is the greatest character in all of media because he was sad. I love the game but c'mon.\n\nEither way, I still disagree with you. I thought there was plenty of great character writing in V, I just think because it isn't obvious \u2014 dark, brooding criminals expressing their regrets constantly and being angry \u2014 it's lost on some people.\n\nMichael is a deeply insecure man who lacks self-awareness and can't cope with his conflicting desires to both be a normal man with a normal family and his impulses toward high-stakes chaos and violence. Michael doesn't *need* to be a criminal \u2014 he already has the wealth. But he needs to feel *alive*, and he can only get that from his criminal activity.\n\nFranklin is ambitious, grounded, and driven, but he can't see that his drive to make it out of the hood via criminal activity will ultimately leave him alienated from everyone except for his criminal allies \u2014 and depending on which ending you choose, potentially even alienated from them.\n\nTrevor is a maniac whose only real human quality is his deep, deep loyalty to people he considers his allies, even if he actively hates them like he does Michael. He is impulsive, destructive, but buried beneath all of his psychotic behavior loyalty keeps him tenuously tethered to reality.\n\nThe characters are well written, they just aren't sad or angry all the time, so people think they aren't serious enough, which is silly.",
            "Examples?",
            "What if Lucia is an fbi agent like how they did Niko in gta 4 with that one girl",
            "RD2 has a \u201cgood\u201d ending but it\u2019s more of a good ending for Arthur\u2019s soul and his redemption.\n\nUltimately Arthur\u2019s fate is the same no matter what. But if he tries to be a better man, he gets redemption.",
            "Well they're both clearly not very good with agreements lol.",
            "She said she was faithful to Michael until she found him *in* a stripper.",
            "I honestly don't think that will happen, Jason and Lucia will either have an open relationship or the strippers/prostitutes will not be usable, like on RDR1.",
            "It wasn't cheating because Amanda and Michael were in an open relationship. They just agreed to not do anything like that in the house which is why Michael got so angry.",
            "Amanda had no real choice but revenge i guess, she can't leave him both due to selfishness of losing the benefits Michael has. And she also probably might lose the benefits his \"deal\" with Davey gives him. \n\nAmanda does come close i know but i guess she was just conflicted during that time.",
            "You\u2019re likely not the only one. That\u2019s why it\u2019s kinda stupid. If your sarcastic tone isn\u2019t clear in your message, then the humor was already lost.",
            "thats /srs",
            "/s is sarcasm (like how /j is jk/joke) /Srs is typically meant as serious",
            "Still haven\u2019t gotten over that. Fuck that girl.",
            "lucia was in prison. if anyone if fbi its jason",
            "That blows my mind. I thought she was just toxic and cheated on him because he got bored with life or something. It\u2019s been over ten years since I actually played the story mode so most of it is just a blur to me.",
            "I agree, but there\u2019s also a common issue that a lot of people on Reddit have the mental awareness of brick and don\u2019t realize your making a joke even when you\u2019ve spelled it out for them",
            "Michelle is said girl",
            "True",
            "Nope, Michael in the middle of his mid life crisis had an affair, and the way Amanda puts it makes me think he caught him mid penetration.\n\nSo she had revenge affairs, and she even got an throat std from him, that's why she won't go down on him.",
            "Let that be their problem. It\u2019s more fun when people get genuinely mad at jokes, especially when they don\u2019t know you.",
            "Karen",
            "Woooow. I was out here feeling so sorry for this dude like he was the victim of his own family. Really he set the ball in motion by doing it first. It makes me understand her more, because she was hurt and betrayed all this time."
