            "$36 for breakfast at the hotel, it was continental so not really that great tasting and the kids mostly wasted food. $35 for parking at Sesame Street place, we brought food in so I only spent $20 on dippin dots before we left, since it was mid 90s. The hotel bar upped their prices on beer from Wednesday to Thursday, a $2 increase in the same beer which I thought was a little strange, same time I was drinking too, just a different bartender. Wawa for breakfast today before we head into Philly for some kid museum, we found an Irish restaurant that looked good but zero parking so instead we plan on a Mexican place closer to the hotel.",

Nice thing is that now I'm buying t-shirts sized L instead of XL like I used to. My only problem is that sometimes shirts sized L vary in sizes, and so the shoulder width doesn't always match me. But buying XL sized shirts doesn't feel good either because they're meant to accomodate a way bigger gut than I have.\n\nApparently our boss got in a shouting match with someone from corporate arguing over how he should be running the branch, and this was perfectly timed to coincide with him getting a call that one of our crews locked themselves out of their truck at a stop over an hour away.

            "Took the Polonium K out Wednesday and it ran great even if a bit gassy. Did have a round get pushed back into the case which dumped powder and jammed the gun up good. Mortared the hell out of the gun for a few rounds and bent a cleaning rod clearing out a FTE. Running the bore snake through a few times remedied the issue but it was an exhausting 15min of troubleshooting and buggering with a new build that initially worked fine. Discovered that initial jam + more lube (thinking it was fouling/lack of lube issue) + residual spilled powder = chamber super glue. \n\nOn the agenda still is figuring out which 16\" build will run with the K (one has AGB, other does not) and how much zero shift I get on the pencil barrels with a heavy string of fire. The 11.5\" SBR I started on was hitting a 12\" plate at 100 yds offhand for maybe 10 rounds before it started to wander. Could have been me or the fact it has a Faxon pencil barrel and it was drooping with the added heat/weight. Have a 11.5\" CORE in the drawer to build a second setup and make a decision between the two. Preferred the Faxon for lighter weight but the core might help with balance when I add the LAM/Light up front and should definitely help with accuracy. This would ideally be a <200yd gun with occasional bouts to 300yd for matches, so if the Faxon is opening up/stringing too much I might just throw it to GAFS and stick with the Core and keep it a dedicated NV/CQB setup and reserve the 200/300 yd stuff for the 16\" builds. I'm in \"Open\" division now at the local match since they change \"Limited\" to RDS only and excluded all magnification, and open allows for multiple guns.",

            "Earlier this month I was in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and [this asshole ](https://imgur.com/a/Bklb7O8) took my beloved old backpack from the entry point parking lot. We arrived, unloaded and piled up our gear, and as usual I went hustling down the portage trail (about 2/3 mile) with a pack and a canoe to get things going. As I was returning and almost back to the parking lot after everyone else had departed, I heard something in the woods just to the side of the trail and sure enough it was a big bear about 10 yards away. I snapped a couple of quick pics before yelling it off, and it barely budged. Got back to our stuff and my pack was *gone*- we suspect the bear stashed it and was back for more. In it was my fishing tackle (fortunately not my fishing reels), my prescription sunglasses, my crocs, and a few more bits and pieces.\n\nFirst trip in the BWCA was 1998 and between myself and members of my usual group we have hundreds of trips worth of experience, and we'd never had a bear encounter like it. Every once in awhile you hear about bears becoming pack robbers but they're rare, and regardless now I'm treating my smelly rubber worms and fake leeches like food. Historically we don't even keep toothpaste in our tent knowing they can smell it so its not like we're totally unaware but there's a first time for everything I suppose",

She came to our camp in the middle of the night, knocked over the pots and pans as a sound trap, *lowered* the bags from the tree branch, *opened the latches* on each bag and found the one with the food in it. She took off and dropped a small trail into the woods. In the morning, we followed the trail and found a small clearing where there was an absolute graveyard of campers backpacks and food containers. She had *unscrewed the lids* on the tupperware and licked every one clean. The bag was partially destroyed, but there was a really nice bag that was in perfect condition, and we returned that one with our awesome story when we got back a few days later.

            "From the linked article:  \n\n**The Supreme Court\u2019s Reckless Bump Stocks Decision**     \n\nBump stocks turn regular guns into automatic weapons, and the Supreme Court just rolled back the ATF rule banning them.  \n\nToday, the Supreme Court struck down a federal rule banning bump stocks in Garland v. Cargill.   \n\nBump stocks are dangerous accessories that convert semiautomatic weapons into fully automatic guns that can fire hundreds of rounds per minute. After bump stocks were used to murder 60 people and injure hundreds more at the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas in 2017\u2014the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history\u2014the ATF issued a rule categorizing bump stocks as machine guns and therefore banning their ownership.  \n\nNow, in a 6\u20133 decision, the Supreme Court has recklessly undone this lifesaving ban and allowed automatic weapons back into civilian life. In his decision, Justice Thomas uses a narrow, technical reading to reach his conclusion that bump stocks don\u2019t cause the type of rapid fire that federal law defines as a machine gun, in spite of their ability to kill scores of people in mere seconds.   \n\n\nOur attorneys filed an amicus brief in Cargill arguing in favor of the ATF\u2019s rule banning bump stocks, which Justice Sotomayor referenced twice in her dissenting opinion. She reinforced the commonsense position that bump stocks act like automatic weapons and therefore must be regulated like automatic weapons, writing, \u201cWhen I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.\u201d   \n\nAdditionally, as our team delved deeper into the opinion, we discovered that the majority opinion propped its argument up with information and drawings from the Firearm Policy Coalition\u2014an extremist gun rights organization with alarming rhetoric.   \n\nWhile this is a reckless decision from a right-wing court beholden to the gun lobby, it\u2019s not the final word on bump stocks. Congress has the power to take immediate action to ban bump stocks in order to keep what are effectively machine guns off our streets. Without action, lives are at risk.",

True, Rahimi didn't raise due process concerns so they didn't comment on the process outlined by the law being adequate.  That doesn't matter though as several categories of prohibited persons have no process attached to them at all.\n\nMost egregiously is the category for illegal users of drugs because it's not a prohibition after conviction as purchases are stopped cold should you admit to being an illegal drug user.  The 4473 is even explicit about this now as it states that the use of marijuana where in states where it is legal still prevents the transfer of the firearm due to marijuana being illegal.\n\nIn other words, if Hunter Biden couldn't own guns now that he's been convicted of being an illegal drug user *Rahimi* would make it harder to overturn.

But considering that *Heller* first used the phrase to \"law-abiding, responsible citizens\" in the context of being entitled to 2nd Amendment protections, as well as the court's reference in the *Bruen* ruling on the test of \"how and why the regulations burden a law-abiding citizen's right to armed self-defense,\" I suspect the court would probably take the view point that if Congress wants to legalize the use of certain substances in all or most cases, they are free to change the law to do so.  But I suspect that Congress would, rightly, retain some prohibitions on citizens altering their mental state while engaged in certain activities, like operating vehicles engaged in interstate commerce (whether they be trucks, buses, trains, planes or boats).",

This is the case that got us the Miranda warning about the right against self-incrimination during police interviews/interrogations. Miranda was accused of kidnapping and rape. The Supreme Court overturned his conviction and remanded the case back to a lower court for retrial. That trial, using different evidence, also saw him convicted, Apparently, he did around three years between the original conviction and the overturning of his conviction and then another five years after his second conviction before he was paroled. Four years after being paroled he was stabbed to death in a bar and, although a subject was identified, there was insufficient evidence to try him.

Even if the judge grants bail, the judge can put into the bail agreement that the defendant cant have any contact with the victim complainant thus theoretically keeping him/her safe.

But given the dramatically presence of the AR-15 and similar rifles in Americans' homes, I can't say I'd be voting on AWBs winning in the end, if I were a betting man.",

Many ordinary people genuinely support Marcos and Prabowo as well. We're not talking about a dictator with 0% approval sending the army to kill people like the Shah of Iran did to his complete failure.",
            "Federally I agree with you, with the caveat that a particularly \"bad\" election followed by a tragedy could wreck it all. The longer time goes however without this being accomplished, the less likely it is.\n\nOn a state basis though things can and will get worse for a lot of people as urbanization turns purple regions into blue ones. I don't see the red/blue divide on guns going anywhere anytime soon and the convoluted mess that is interstate gun law will continue to escalate.\n\nI'm not a defeatist by any stretch, and I think the gun side has done far more admirably than a lot of people realize.....but the state by state polarization is sad to see and I don't think a magic court case will reverse it all."
