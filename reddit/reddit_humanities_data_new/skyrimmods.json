            "I was looking for quest mods and a lot of people suggested Death Consumes All, so I grabbed it. It took me a long time to find the NPC to start the quest, so I did other quests with tough enemies in the mean time. Those tough enemies all dropped this thing called Blood of Energy and I had no idea what it was for, so I held onto all of them in case they were important. \n\nThey were. >!I finally started Death Consumes All and discovered that they're used to unlock the story. So I used them. All 40 of them. And fast tracked all the way to the end of the quest while I dicked around in the wilderness, listening to the tale. I was so confused when other players were talking about a Riverwood portion or needing to do the College of Winterhold questline. Apparently, I skipped it all and went straight to the brutally difficult endgame. I still occasionally find places where the mod's assets were used, presumably to tell the actual story lol!<\n\nAt least I saved a lot of people, I guess?",

            "Skyrim wont boot tabbed in. I am playing with mods, and launching as with SKSE, through MO2. When I hit launch it will open and almost immediately \"un-focus\" and the instance won't be engaged. Sometimes there is an audio \"skip\", like it's getting snagged on something. Not until I click in or click on the toolbar icon will it \"re-focus\" on skyrim. This doesn't seem to affect any performance, like my mods work just fine and I don't lose frames. However, what does happen is the blackpoint get really dark. What I mean by that is, by default skyrim loads with like a slightly lighter black (almost like its a little grey rather than pure black) and I prefer this visually. It looks really nice to me and I'd like to keep it. However, when I alt-tab out of skyrim it will remove this filter, and subsequently, also why I boot with these mods.

        "content": "Recently, Bethesda released a large update with a new marketplace, a few new features, and some bug fixes. It also launched the new Verified Creator program that introduces paid mods via Bethesda.net. Here is what we know as of Feb 10, 2024:\n\nThe Patch notes and change log\n===\nThis update is versioned 1.6.1130. Here is the the [official patch notes from Bethesda](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/article/4ORD7tshfmHUN8H4ULSgE4/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-creations-update-patch-notes).\n\nJanuary 17, 2024 Update\n===\nBethesda announced that another update (after 1.6.1130) will be released on January 17, 2024 at 11 AM (US Eastern time). This update will roll out on GOG, Epic Store, Bethesda Net, Xbox, and PlayStation first, with the Steam release coming later on:\n\n> Happy Tuesday everyone!\n\n> We're planning on patching Skyrim on January 17th at 11:00am EST. Please note, that this patch will only apply to GOG, Epic Store, Bethesda Net, Xbox, and PlayStation. The Steam version of the patch will have a slight delay and be applied after. Our patch notes will be shared here as soon as they are finalized. Thanks for your patience!\n\nHere is the [announced patch notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/198sr58/skyrim_special_editionanniversary_edition_january/?) for the update.\n\nThe \"ESL\" form ID increase\n===\nThis is actually only tangentially related to ESLs, as all plugin types now get 2048 addition form IDs to use.\n\nPreviously, Skyrim's ESL-flagged plugins only had 2048 form IDs to work with: 0x800-0xFFF. This is due to a Skyrim engine bug that reserved form IDs 0x0-0x7FF from all plugins when it should only be reserved from Skyrim.esm. Now the range of 0x0-0x7FF can be used by plugins other than Skyrim.esm, which means increasing the number of form IDs available to all plugins by 2048, and doubling the amount of new forms that can be stored in ESL-flagged plugins.\n\nThis was previously fixed on Fallout 4, and has been ported back to Skyrim for the v1.6.1130 update.\n\nThe issue with this fix is any new plugins, not just ESL-flagged plugins, can now be made with form IDs in the 0x0-0x7FF range. If an old SkyrimSE.exe, such as downgraded, VR, or GOG versions of the game, loads these new plugins, the game will immediately crash. There are no mods that use these new form IDs yet. The concern is that future mod makers might make plugins using form IDs in this range, which will not be backwards compatible with downgraded, VR, or GOG versions of the game.\n\nHowever, a more immediate concern is Bethesda shipped a \"_ResourcePack.esl\" with the v1.6.1130 update. This plugin uses form IDs in the 0x0-0x7FF range. So if you try to load this \"_ResourcePack.esl\" file from a downgraded (or GOG, VR) exe, your game will immediately crash. If you crash with address `SkyrimSE.exe+0198090`, `SkyrimSE.exe+0197E90` or `SkyrimSE.exe+05E1F22`, this might be the cause. **[Nukem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4995023) has released a SKSE plugin DLL that will allow 0x0-0x7FF and v1.71 plugins to be loaded on older exes: [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441).**\n\nSKSE and Address Library\n===\nSKSE and [Address Library](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444) has already been updated for the v1.6.1130 update. However, there appears to be lingering problems with these updates.\n\nAddress Library is in a testing phase, and [powerofthree](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2148728) has reported that many existing SKSE DLL mods do not work with it. This is because this update, although smaller than the \"AE\" update from 2021, is still bigger than what Address Library can fully handle: there have been some ID changes and game structure changes that break stuff.\n\nOf course, any other DLL mod that doesn't rely on Address Library will need to be updated for the new v1.6.1130 version to work with that version. This includes [RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080) and [Faster HDT-SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339)\n\nSkyUI\n===\nPeople were reporting that [SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604)'s and **difficulty selection** and **search bar** functionalities were not working with the new v1.6.1130 update.\n\n**Update:** What appears to have happened is that when Bethesda added the **marketplace** menu entry, they inserted it into the middle of an [enumerated type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type) definition used for communication between the game exe and flash. This caused all subsequent items in the enum to be offset. Skyrim uses flash for UI, so these changed offsets are no longer compatible with SkyUI.\n\nAs of SKSE v2.2.5, SkyUI's **search bar** functionality has been fixed.\n\nv1.6.1130's **difficulty selection** bug with SkyUI has been fixed with [SkyUI SE - Difficulty Persistence Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106418)\n\nControl Map\n===\n**Update:** If you had a custom controlmap.txt from a mod, the game is reported to crash when you try to run the new v1.6.1130 update.\n\nThe cause of this, like with SkyUI, is the addition of the marketplace entry to the control map. If this entry is missing, as the case with old control maps, the game will crash.\n\n**Update 2:** As of SKSE v2.2.5, the controlmap.txt crash has been fixed.\n\nSSE Engine Fixes and plugins.txt loading\n===\n**Update**: People have been reporting that [SSE Engine Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17230) breaks plugins.txt loading with Engine Fixes versions 6.1.0 and older, which means your plugin load order is not loaded correctly by the game. This appears to be due to SSE Engine Fixes's achievement enabler. To fix this, update Engine Fixes to v6.1.1 or above\n\nPlugin version 1.71\n===\nBethesda also incremented the plugin version from 1.7 to 1.71. Any plugin made with this version specified in the header will also crash any older version exes such as VR, GOG, and downgraded Steam SkyrimSE.exe. No mods are using this version number yet. However this is the version number of the the updated free Fishing Creation's plugin (ccBGSSSE001-Fish.esm), and as such, running older exes with the up-to-date Fishing Creation will immediately crash the game. If you crash with address `SkyrimSE.exe+0198090`, `SkyrimSE.exe+0197E90` or `SkyrimSE.exe+05E1F22`, this might be the cause.\n **[Nukem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4995023) has released a SKSE plugin DLL that will allow 0x0-0x7FF and v1.71 plugins to be loaded on older exes: [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441).**\n\nThe latest Unofficial skyrim special edition patch has also been updated to this plugin version. If you're using an older exe, you can fix by either reverting to an [earlier version](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266?tab=files&file_id=392477&nmm=1), editing the plugin version to 1.7 in the header with SSEedit, or by using [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441).\n\nSteam integration is missing\n===\n\nIt appears that Skyrim Special Edition v1.6.1130 shipped without Steam integration. So this version of the game effectively has no DRM. Achievements also don't work with v1.6.1130.\n\nIt is expected that Bethesda will ship an update in the near future to address this.\n\n---\n\nVerified Creator (paid mods) program\n===\nBethesda also rolled out a Verified Creator Program to Bethesda.net. Mod makers can now apply to become a \"verified creator\" with Bethesda. If approved, they will be allowed to upload mods on Bethesda.net and charge users creation club credits. You can find the official description of the program here: [Bethesda Game Studio Creations](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/creators/bethesdagamestudios)\n\n**Current paid mods**\n\n* [Shadetree Lodge](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/5492/Shadetree_Lodge) by [Elianora](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/all?author_displayname=TheRealElianora) for 500 credits (approximately $5)\n* [Aldmeri Anti-mage](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/5486/Aldmeri_Anti_mage) by [Niero](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/all?author_displayname=Niero) for 400 credits (approximately $4)\n* [Arquebus](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/5463/Arquebus) by [Shoeburglar](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/all?author_displayname=Shoeburglar) for 600 credits (approximately $6)\n* [Legendary Dungeons: Dwarven Delves](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/5401/Legendary_Dungeons__Dwarven_Delves) by [Trainwiz](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/all?author_displayname=Trainwiz) for 400 credits (approximately $4)\n* [Katja The Thief](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/5291/Katja_The_Thief) by [unoctium](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/all?author_displayname=unoctium) for 400 credits (approximately $4)\n* [Winterfrost Plus Edition](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/5584/Winterfrost_Plus_Edition) by [TheDogOfWar](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/all?author_displayname=TheDogOfWar) for 600 credits (approximately $6)\n* [Winterfrost (PS4)](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/5585/Winterfrost) by [TheDogOfWar](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/all?author_displayname=TheDogOfWar) for 500 credits (approximately $5)\n* [East Empire Expansion](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/5294/East_Empire_Expansion) by [kinggath_creations](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/all?author_displayname=kinggath_creations) for 700 credits (approximately $7)\n* [Morthal](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/5516/Morthal) by [Arthmoor](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/all?author_displayname=Arthmoor) for 200 credits (approximate $2)\n\n**Bethesda/Creator monetization split**\n\nWe have inquired both the paid mod authors and Bethesda about the details of the split. However, neither parties have been willing to divulge the details. We have not seen any claims about the split that is credibly sourced elsewhere on the internet.\n\n**Support for paid mods**\n\nIt appears that there is currently no official support channels for paid mods on Bethesda.net. Users cannot rate or comment on paid mods. All support for paid mods are currently being handled unofficially, such as via the authors' discord servers.\n\nIt should also be noted that paid mods are not considered official Bethesda content like previous Creation Club add-ons and will disable achievements like free mods by default.\n\n**What is allowed on paid mods**\n\nComments from official Bethesda sources indicates that paid mods are limited in the following ways:\n\n* They cannot rely on any other mods or resources and must be standalone. This means they cannot use [SKSE](https://skse.silverlock.org/), must use vanilla body, and cannot use frameworks such as [Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109) or [Spell Perk Item Distributor (SPID)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869), for example. This also means any compatibility patching must be done elsewhere as separate free mod.\n* They must be new. Mod authors cannot make an existing mod a paid mod. Any collaborative work must be handled outside of Bethesda.net among the contributors themselves.\n* They cannot use generative AI.\n* They must adhere to Bethesda.net community standards. This means, for example, paid mods cannot contain nudity.\n* Since paid mods are delivered via the in-game menu, they are not fully supported by mod managers such as Mod Organizer 2 or Vortex. This also means they cannot contain installers for automatic patches or options.",

I paid for every single pack and expansion and then loaded it down with a bunch of user-made mods, and some free ones I liked. But then like, a couple months ago, my grandson was going through all my add-ons and pointed out that I'm somewhere between $800 - $1000 into this game. I didn't even realize it... I just bought a new pack or kit whenever it came out. I'm shocked to see how much I've spent on a game that I hardly play anymore. Swore to myself I would be much more careful with spending on games going forward. So, any mods I would be inclined to buy I would likely preview on YouTube, and unless it's the type of mod that changes gameplay or something major like that, I'd prolly skip it cause I'd already know all about it.

It's not that the creators don't put time and effort into it, but it's that whatever price point they pick - it's not value for money. \n\nYou can buy full, new AAA games for AUD$30 or less on sale (sometimes not even on sale). Where is the value proposition in a minor mod for a 12-year old game that costs AUD$5? \n\nIt's a symptom of: \n\n(a) corporate greed wanting to skim too high of a percentage off the top of the creator's works; and \n\n(b) the fact that mod creators do not have economies of scale, so because it's often a 1-man show and they're getting only a small cut, the price-point needs to be set at a figure that makes it worth their time for it to be economically viable as a job, instead of a hobby... but because of the lack of economies of scale, the value proposition for the average consumer just isn't there (not to mention there are quality control issues).\n\nThe last point, which I think is often overlooked, is that making mod creation a paid vocation instead of a hobby that might pay a dividend in donations is, in my opinion, a mistake. It perverts the incentives behind mod creation. Now the goal is to make a mod with mass appeal, to sell it to as many as possible, rather than to make a mod in fulfilment of the mod author's creative vision.\n\nMake no mistake, paid mods are **not** good for the modding community or for the longevity of Bethesda's games. They still haven't learned their lesson, despite the first paid mods fiasco going down like the Hindenburg, and despite the Creation Club being an abject failure (it suffers from the same issues above).

Game should still be able to launch but -\n\nvanilla game only will launch can't get my extensive load order to load at all game will CTD before it even reaches the main menu. This indicates some issue with a skse plugin most likely in other words my load order requires a complete rebuild from scratch. Not something I particularly look forward to its not as straightforward as earlier patchers you could basically just swap the game.exe and a .dll or two and voila game worked just fine. Not this time.\n\nn.b. if anyone wants to avoid the downgrader just replace the SkyrimSELauncher.exe the SkyrimSE.exe and binkw64.dll and steam_api64.dll's with the earlier versions and the game will fire up just like before (both with Backported Extended ESL Support mod and SKSE or you'll simply CTD.)  Results were almost the same and you'll still crash with anything more than a basic few mods\n\nSo yeah, a bit of a mess really at this point I think I'm just going to batten down the hatches roll back to the unupdated game and block steam updates at this point.

The new valid range applies to *all* plugin types. Pair that with the fact that the CK decides the form ID for you when you use it on mods, and now any mod author using the updated CK will almost certainly have form IDs that are invalid for VR and pre 1.6.1130 builds of SE unless they go out of their way to adjust IDs in xEdit.",
            "I somewhat agree, with the exception that Bethesda (with access to source code) is capable of making changes to the engine that simply aren't feasible for modders. The mods will always be updated, as long as the creator is active or they're open source, so if Bethesda can improve things enough it could be worth it.\n\nWhat they should really do is make the Skyrim SE engine open source. It's old enough now that it wouldn't hurt them from an IP perspective.",

            "It's not quite that simple. What SKSE mods do (usually) is either (a) replace individual `call` instructions in the executable with the address of a new function, which then calls the original function, returning control to the engine, or (b) intercepts all calls to a given function (and calls the original too, usually).\n\nThe point is to hook into the execution of the engine at points in the game loop that is convenient for us to modify whatever we want to modify. Even if we had an API for every game function, calling internal game functions is only a small part of what SKSE mods do. For example, if I want to modify how the game draws shadows, I don't just need to call the \"doShadowPass\" function, I need to *intercept* the function call I'm interested in and modify its operation. Even if there were an API released with every game version, the location of the hook I need for that interception may still change, and the mod would break.\n\n Having access to an official library of game functions would be *helpful*, but it's not a silver bullet at all. There would still be tons of RE work required, and updates would still break a bunch of mods.",

The invalid range on the high end is what compacting solved and that part did not change. Form IDs 0x0-0x7FF where not valid for *any* plugins prior to this update, and they are now valid for use.\n\nWhat this actually does is allow new esls and espfes to have twice as many form IDs/records, so larger mods can be esl-ified.

Well now it's even longer! To access the tower of Mzark in Blackreach, you need to get through the Silent City Ruin, and the only easy way to enter Silent City Ruin is through the catacombs.\n\nThis adds very few objects and edits very few things. It's an ESPFE and should be compatible with everything.",
