Enjoy your retirement from the sub!\n\nAt this time our team is drafting changes to make for the convenience of not only ourselves when modding but also for the convenience of you, the users. These changes will include rule changes. We plan to make them easier to understand which we believe will make them easier to follow and lead to less confusion in the future. An announcement will be made when these new rules are ready, please be on the lookout for that.\n\nIn addition to this we plan to implement some browsing changes including the removal of the ability to post links. we believe this will lead to less spam bots such as Temu and Onlyfans bots.\n\nLastly, Mod applications are reopening starting now. If you believe you will be a good fit for our team feel free to apply, even if you have no prior modding experience.  (We will not be hiring right away if you are selected)  [Application Link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_ndAtJBvlBwryjuWnq1PGtWX6cTJ9_vh8f4330sGYIc/edit?pli=1)\n\nThank you all for being apart of the sub!",

If I hadn't got therapy and I merely said, \"My brother bullied me and it left me mentally damaged,\" that might not really help anyone.

Whereas by saying how therapy has helped me, it might cause other bullied people to seek therapy and get the help they need.\n\nI honestly wish I'd got therapy for this many years ago.

            "In which scenario would you do that small talk like that?\n\nCause I just imagined the situation with colleagues at work. I greet them in the morning and may or may not have small talk according to how much I and the other person feels like. So your question how my day (or well maybe yesterday as it's just morning yet) has been would come at that point.\n\nBut over the day when I have a question or request or something, I just go over to them and get to the point immediately, no need to start a small talk every time we interact. For example at fridays we eat bockwurst normally and one colleague get's them for the rest of us and asks everyone if they want one. So she comes in the room, askes if we want one, we answer and that's all. Sometimes we may do a bit small talk like talking about the weather cause she's about to go outside to get them, but not that much small talk if at all.\n\nDoesn't mean there's no small talk over the day, but just when people feel like, not as necessity for being polite or something like that.",

I could teach my daughter to say blue when she sees yellow, green when she sees purple, etc. And if no one ever corrected her, it would change nothing about the world. You feel me?",

            "I believe it's intrinsic because we all have the same emotional reaction to colours, despite having been taught it or not. For instance, if u walk into a glowing blue room, you'll feel very calm. But if u walk into a glowing red room, you'll feel hesitant, maybe a little paranoid, you'll be a little more aware. Our bodies all have the same reactions to the same colours because of the colour they actually are, not what we might perceive them to be. \n\nWe also understand blue to be sad, as in saying to someone \"You're feeling blue\", or yellow being happy. That's impossible to all be on the same page on if it wasn't an innate reaction that's the same in all of us"
