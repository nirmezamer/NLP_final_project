It has to be a certain treated wood as well, or you have to set up a yearly scrap and mulch during slow periods. Most places go with rubber, but the church wanted \"natural\" so we had limits because fake wood rubber wasn't worth the price per sqft. \n\nThat wasn't taking into account heat since we were working with a shaded church playground.

The article doesn't say how long the install took, but since it mentioned the set being installed on studs, which I don't see in the picture, I suspect that they put the play set together in the parking lot and eventually carried it over to the mounting points.  Those would likely be holes dug in the ground, which you would then fill with concrete and rebar before putting a 4x4 or something in that you would eventually mount the actual structure to.  That could easily take multiple days--excavator, concrete truck or mixer on site, gradual pour to make sure that the interior is curing properly rather than staying mushy, etc. (Assuming that the process is the same there; Jacsonville's only about 30ft above sea level, and I'm not sure what that does to construction.

Because the system *is.* Just.  That's what the civil rights marches did.  Fix everything left that was still broken since the civil war :)\n\nI completely appreciate not wanting the chaos of Jan 6th to be a standard for protest and transfer of power.  The issue I see among Americans in general is being simply *blind* to moral grey areas and the idea that sometimes you have to judge a cause by what it's fighting for rather than how it's fighting it.  We do this *all the time* with power struggles *outside* the borders of the US.  Yet within it, anything that upsets the apple-cart is tantamount to treason, regardless of reason.\n\nThe example I usually fall back to is the Hong Kong protests where people were literally fighting with police and in some cases using what would be considered \"life-threatening\" weapons against them.  This is not to say that US police == Chinese police.  But that such a comparison at all serves to shatter the idea that protests must always be peaceful.  We dress up ideas we like in noble notions like \"peaceful protest, non-violence, well-dressed, mannered, eloquent,\"   because the alternative is to struggle with the fact that maybe our moral compass *is* a bit relative and sometimes fighting for a cause within that system's bounds is the same as tying your own hands or asking another to tie theirs.  A noble sacrifice certainly, but there's an ever thinning gap between \"noble sacrifice\" and \"suffering in silence.\"",
            "> No we are fucking not ok with that.\n\n\nI suspect many of the folks who are \"okay\" with not taking vacation are those living paycheck-to-paycheck and who don't get any paid time off from work.

For example my dad works in a place where they do \"rate\" meaning they've got a set number of things to build and if they finish early they go home early but get paid for a full day. They can usually knock out the work load in like 4 hours and then go home with a full 8 hours of pay but they work really lean so they'll have like 2 people who can do each job if one person takes a day off it can make everyone else on the team have to work an extra 4 hours and if it's a situation where one person is great and their partner sucks it can result in then working even longer.  Then there's some where they just have to stop. My brother is 1 of 2 electricians on his team and if they're both gone no work can get done. He had people all pissed off at him recently because the other electrician took vacation time and my brother took 2 days off when his wife went into labor early so all work had to stop and his coworkers ended up with 2 days with no work and no pay. \n\nIt's not uncommon to hear them complain about people taking vacation time or sick days and saying things like \"we get a week off over the 4th and a week off during Christmas that should be enough for everyone\" nevermind that those are unpaid shutdowns and not vacations.",

One is that it also includes things like sick days, it rolls over and accumulates, can be used for things like medical emergencies, and can be used to either retire early or be cashed out at retirement. Missing work can also sometimes be stressful, as we have a fixed number of days to get through the curriculum.\u00a0On top of that as a teacher I get plenty of vacation compared to most Americans, so using all my PTO days as they come isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nBut if I had a more standard job and all my vacation were in the form of a few weeks I\u2019d PTO you can bet I\u2019d be taking all of it.

The BLS tracks all this stuff - the average private sector employee at 3-5 years of service had 15 paid vacation days and 7 sick days. This is across all industries, so some are much lower (service industry jobs generally) and some are higher. I say this just to clarify so that people don\u2019t think they\u2019re getting great benefits when they get 14 days off a year; that\u2019s average in the US so don\u2019t let companies lie to you lol"
