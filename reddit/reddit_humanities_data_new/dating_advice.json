            "Was seeing a guy for 2 months, 2x a week, texting all the time, sleeping together, etc. He decided he doesn\u2019t see us working well long-term and that we\u2019d be better as friends and I\u2019m simply shook? \n\nThings felt good and easy and fun but he said there\u2019s no romantic potential and we\u2019re better platonic and I just??? \n\nFiguring out how to not beat myself up for giving it my all and it not working out is probably the most challenging part. I thought there was potential for something but now I\u2019m being so self-critical and am very fearful of putting myself back out there. Don\u2019t even really know if it\u2019s related to him or just the internal battle of rejection.",
            "I (39, m, virgin) was talking to this girl on tinder for a week (my second match in almost five years). I thought I was pretty savvy with this stuff but then she dropped the onlyfans link. Feel pretty stupid now and really crushed. I probably wasn't even talking to that girl to be honest, was probably her boyfriend or someone who manages her stuff.\n\nI should've stayed negative and not let myself feel any hope, at least that's how I feel right now. Inching towards being the 40 year old virgin for real. Getting really tired of getting up everyday to bust my ass at work and be exhausted all the time, feeding myself, having to brush my teeth and piss and shit. And do it all again the next day. I'm just a body keeping himself alive because it's the routine while I get nothing out of being alive. \n\nAnd therapy just doesn't cut it for me anymore. I know my issues and I'm trying my best, but life feels empty and pointless. I just want to experience intimacy of any kind. Life is so lonely. It has to get better at some point, right?",
            "I've had 3 incredible dates with this dude that I'm into. I am being positive, but cautious as I am still trying to get to know him. On our third date, we opened up to each other about our family life and such. We last chatted on Friday about his weekend plans, and mine, and then we didn't talk Saturday or Sunday, which is fine. I texted him today and there's been no indication that he will be reaching out to me at all. I'm 26F and he's 34M. I feel like I'm overthinking things, but I am also negative to the fact he may respond back being that I just don't want to get hurt. If he does ghost me, then how should I go about getting over that fact? I've never been ghosted before, either, so idk. I'm just ranting. I feel like I'm going freaking crazy.",
            "29M here with very minimal dating experience, just had a first date with 30F that's left me really confused. \n\nWe were having a nice conversation on the app for around a week until I asked her out, which she said she was hoping I would do, but come day of it seemed like a switch flipped and she was completely disinterested? When we met up, I tried to make conversation by asking about her hobbies- she gave me mostly short answers and didn't really ask me anything in return. I don't know how I would've said anything uncomfortable since there weren't any heavy topics and it felt hard to talk about myself since she didn't seem to engage much. I also tried to then lighten the mood by asking her if she wanted to play a little game, which she went along with, but it didn't really seem to land either. I'm not the best looking guy in the world for sure, but my pictures are up to date, I dressed nicely and made sure my hygiene was on point, I tried to show I was interested and actively engaged, I tried to be very considerate to not do anything that might make her uncomfortable.... and she unmatched me shortly after? I don't have a problem with not having a connection, but as someone who is new to dating / anxious / getting close to 30, man did that just feel super discouraging. Is dating really that hard? Why would someone agree to a date just to act like they don't want to be there at all?",
            "Over the weekend I (29F) got a nice rejection text from someone (38M) I went on an amazing first date with a few weeks ago. He said he thought we had great chemistry (I agree) but he doesn't know if we'd quite work long term. And I'm just so confused and honestly frustrated that he wouldn't even give it a chance. I did respond and say I actually do think we have long term potential so if you change your mind and we're both still single feel free to reach out. IDK if that was desperate but I figured I have nothing to lose.",
            "I\u2019ve been seeing this guy who seems really cool, but I don\u2019t think we have a romantic connection. We\u2019ve hung out multiple times and haven\u2019t even kissed, the most he\u2019s done is put his arm around me. Plus the conversation still feels super stilted. Which sucks because it\u2019s been really nice having someone to go on dates with and do different activities with, but obviously I don\u2019t want to lead this person on. Anyone else feel like mutual attraction/compatibility feels so rare these days?",
            "25th birthday coming soon and still never had a boyfriend or been kissed. went on a handful of dates (<10) my whole life. I'm just so sad I don't know why I can't find love. Granted I think 50% is me and 50% of the reasons have been life circumstances (moving a lot, work challenges, covid etc) I just feel like I'm getting so old now.",
            "Talking to this girl for about about 2 months. Multiple dinner dates\u2014texts/phone calls/kissing sessions.  \nWe went out last weekend and did an \u201cactive\u201d date because she \u201cwanted to see me in the wild\u201d. Long story short\u2014we spoke last night and I got the old\u2014we aren\u2019t compatible convo and she doesn\u2019t see a long term future with me. I tried to smoothly press for specifics but she wouldn\u2019t elaborate and actually got testy with me. I\u2019m 45 and she is 38. She has 2 kids and asked me if I want more kids (I have son starting HS so I said that wasn\u2019t in the cards for me. She told me that she was back and forth on more kids but not committed either way.\n\nI can\u2019t help but beat myself up for screwing this up.\n\nAny help ?",
            "I went speed dating today, met an awesome girl. She was really pretty and super popular so I'm probably 1 of 10 guys who was into her. I gave her my number and I did my best after the event to talk to her and connect with her but I felt like it wasn't enough. After I left I ended up passing her and her friends nearby and we waved bye to each other. Honestly I wish I pitched myself and my ideas for a date (based off of what she was into) at that time. Pretty frustrated right now because of this.\n\nReally hoping she'll text me during the day but experience has taught me that she won't. \ud83d\ude22",
            "Random vent, but I had **three people** cancel dates this week and one \u201cthanks but no thanks text\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m so over dating apps. If I didn\u2019t have a few months, left the pinch premium, I would probably delete my account.",
            "This is a vent people.  \n\nIs anyone else the only single person left in their friend group? Cause I am currently and honestly it can feel so isolating sometimes. I\u2019ve never been the ONLY single person and on top of it all, I was travelling for a few months and it just seemed like when I came home everyone was cuffed and I wasn\u2019t even there for the progression of the relationships (which I love). \n\nI just feel bad sometimes for getting angry at my friends for making more of an effort to see their boyfriends rather than me (especially after being gone for 5 whole months) but I also understand that most of them are in (short) long distance relationships so I feel guilty for getting jealous. \n\nAnyone else riding this bus???? It sucks.",
            "There is a guy I was going on dates with for around a month. We go on dates, have sex, have a common pet project. We are exclusive from the beginning. Can talk about anything, comfort and support each other, and express feelings of sympathy towards each other. Basically, in my book, this could already be called dating.\u00a0\nBut he says that serious relationship is about having a common goals/affairs. So, he thinks bf/gf relationship starts when you start living together.\u00a0\n\n\nSo, according to him, right now we are just hanging out together. This exact wording makes me anxious, so I asked him if that's what we are ('just hanging out') forever, or is it going to move forward? And he told me it can be something more, and expressed his warm feelings towards me. We even talked about children and marriage, even though in a half-joking way.\u00a0\n\n\nSo, I'm not anxious anymore, but his way of thinking seems a bit goofy to me. As I said, in my book if we like each other and this is not locked in 'no strings attached' (as in fwb) status, it's basically already dating.",
            "Sorry abt your situation. I have just gone through something similar. You are not alone.",
            "GOOD LUCK. I feel like talking to multiple people at once if you can is the best way to get out of that anxious state in the early stages.",
            "Probably matched with someone she's more interested in but still felt obligated to go on the date with you.",
            "Maybe he's worried about the age gap being a problem.\u00a0 Maybe he's got something else going on and it was easier to tell you \"it's not going to work\" rather than explain the whole situation to you after only one date.\n\n\nComing in with a man's perspective,\u00a0 it was his way of politely telling you he saw something he really didn't like, and was just being as nice as possible to you, and your feelings.\u00a0\u00a0\nAfter dating enough people, he may be able to look past good chemistry and know there weren't enough boxes checked off to make a long term relationship work.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 I hope you find someone who will value your\u00a0Resting bitch face and have a meaningful connection with someone who checks all your boxes too.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "dating is the wild west",
            "Good idea. Thank you for the tip!",
            "That\u2019s for the perspective. I\u2019ll survive but it does sting a bit. I\u2019m choosing to believe it\u2019s because we live in different boroughs in NYC so it would be a bit of a hike to see each other because that\u2019s the least personal explanation."

        "content": "So I had a situation recently that feels like a trope - guy I was seeing was consistently taking me out on weekly dates but after a few months when I asked what was going on, said he wasn't ready for a relationship, and gave a whole speech about reasons why. Saying he hasn't been able to think about relationships at all, and needs to sort his feelings out, and relationships haven't been on his mind whatsoever.  \n  \nNext thing you know, a month and a half later he has a serious girlfriend.\n\nI know that when someone says they're not ready theres a \"with you\" silently tacked on the end, but why is it always the case they have a serious girlfriend seemingly RIGHT after they say this? Is it because they're dating multiple girls at once, and they tell the rest of the roster they're not ready, or is it a thing where they're somehow primed from dumping a situationship to suddenly be on the hunt for a GF? Because this exact pattern has happened to so many people it seems like there has to be something going on with the timing?",

            "Feeling sorry for yourself is the most dangerous mental trap out there. Self-pitying thoughts carry no value. Thinking them just hurts you and encourages you to give up. They don't offer any meaningful insight, they don't make you feel better, they are simply self-destructive.\n\n\nHis little speech about not being ready for a serious relationship was just an attempt to break it off without hurting your feelings. There could be no specific reason at all, it's hard to define why you \"click\" with one person but not another. Or you burped once and he's a weird little baby and got turned off by it. Unfortunately the specific reasons are something you can never know.\n\n\nAccepting rejection and moving on is difficult. You wanted something, you felt it in your grasp, and then it was ripped away and there's nothing you can do about it.",

Like, I caught up with my ex yesterday (from about 2 years ago), we talked about dating. She says she still uses \"Sorry, I just got out of a long relationship and I'm not ready for anything\" as her goto dump line. People will say whatever they think is going to hurt the least.",

            "I spent four years with a guy who hadn't been in a long term relationship, only one relationship before me, not much sexual experience (32 years old). He was quite shy but lovely guy, I helped him gain loads of confidence, shaped him into an amazing BF (also great in bed), I helped him decorate his house, would help him pick really nice clothes when out shopping, encouraged him to go to the gym, even wrote out workout programmes for him, things a long term GF would help with. We went on holiday, had a fab time, even spoke about living together. We couldn't have got on any better than we were. \n\nWe had a stupid argument a few days later and I never heard from him again (he worked offshore so was gone for a month). I'm stubborn so refused to reach out to him and that was it.  \n\nWe did speak a couple of months later, he was living with someone else by then. He was married and had a baby on the way six months after we had the stupid argument. \n\nFour years we had been together, once I had helped him with his social anxiety, helped build his confidence and get some experience that was it!\n\nYes I was hurt at the time, my ego was bruised and I wanted to know what she had that I didn't, then I realised that for him to have treated me like that, he wasn't as great a guy as I had thought he was, so fuck him!\n\nKarma is a wonderful thing though, he  began to message me all the time, emailed me always wanting to chat, looking for advice, wanting to meet for lunch, complaining about life with my replacement, again proving that he wasn't a great guy by treating the new partner like this by wanting to keep in touch with me. It did give me great satisfaction tbh and then I cut him off completely.",

I\u2019m single after a very unhealthy relationship which happened three years ago sort of figuring out what I want in a partner again I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll meet the right one.

            "Don't worry about it too much. Now you know this man has low character. He enjoys stringing you along for sex until he gets the woman he really wants. You may think that the new girlfriend has it made, but you know his real personality. He is not a catch.",
            "Sometimes you go into a relationship hoping it\u2019s the one, when deep inside you know it\u2019s not. Sometimes being in a relationship teaches you what you\u2019re actually looking for. Not that it\u2019s big differences, but maybe even just subtle things that aren\u2019t quantifiable. A little more this, a little less that. Things that are unique to that person, but someone else might think differently.",

I was the one who gave the speech and was then in a relationship a few weeks later.\n\nI actually really liked both women. I dated one of them, but she was somewhat reserved and I didn't feel the spark 100%. The other lady was in my circle of friends, we went partying together a lot and I never thought I had a chance with her. Then there was one night. Boom. Relationship (now over again).\n\nNeither of them made a mistake at the time. My gut feeling guided me. Nothing more. So you don't need to feel bad. It probably really wasn't your fault.",
            "I have had the same issue a lot and part of it may be they just don\u2019t want a relationship with  you, but part of this which I had to realize for myself as well was that I was allowing it by people pleasing and allowing \u201cgirlfriend privileges\u201d like sex and sleepovers and plenty of time without any commitment.  It helps if he has some fear of losing you, some time to miss you and something to gain by committing. I started being less available for guys and not allowing sex or inviting into my house or spending the night at theirs without commitment. Try to put a cap on how often it goes on. Usually one month should be enough two tops, so don\u2019t let them string you along forever. Walk away after the first \u201cdon\u2019t want a relationship.\u201d It shows confidence and that you don\u2019t need them. Sometimes they will come back wanting one, other times they won\u2019t, but then you can move on and find someone who does and you haven\u2019t wasted too much time or energy.",

Then he found the spark.\n\nOr there  was a unaddressable reason that he did not want to say because he felt it would be hurtful so he made it about him , and not what his misgivings were. \n\nProbably one of those things could be something else.

He said he did when he met his now wife and he knows he hurt the girl he left behind but he just liked his wife more. also, he said a main reason he chose her is that she made her interest in him very clear and was very forward. He suggested to me maybe im not forward with guys or clear when im interested in them. im shy so it does check out. But I think the right man will appreciate me even if im shy.",

On one hand, it feels terrible to be disrespected like that so blatantly.  But on the other hand, I'm glad I have no regrets about leaving them behind.  A dishonest partner would never have been good for me, not even as a friend.",

Take it as a learning experience for future relationships. Sadly,  you never know what a person's true intentions are when you start dating.

At about the month and a half mark I told him that I didn\u2019t do casual sex and I expect monogamy from here on out if I sleep with him. He very enthusiastically said \u201coh, of course.\u201d He quit texting me after I slept with him, but answers my texts. We went on one more date. For 3 weeks in a row he told me he has to go help his parents out of town. Then a few days ago I get a message saying he\u2019s not in the headspace for anything serious. Everything was seemingly perfect. We clicked. He would talk about the future and make plans. What the hell happened?",
            "If I hadn\u2019t been through the exact exception to your rule, I\u2019d be inclined to agree with you. My current boyfriend and I had been in a 6 month talking-stage where at month 3 he told me he wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship. We were texting everyday and seeing each other multiple times a week. He was also showing up often at my job with gifts and snacks. All of it pointed to genuine interest but he just wasn\u2019t ready to take that next step. We had a lot of other factors to consider because we come from completely different religious and cultural backgrounds, and he wasn\u2019t sure if we could work. Fast-forward and now we\u2019ve been in a serious relationship for 9 months. While I can acknowledge it\u2019s pretty rare that longstanding situationships blossom into something more, it can be a bit self-important to assume that someone should be ready for a relationship the moment that you are. Especially if there are external factors. I think the reason they\u2019re saying they\u2019re not ready matters more than the statement itself.",

            "There was no way to vet him, no previous history to go on. He was a genuinely lovely guy, he honestly didn't realise how much he had going for him. He had awful social anxiety, at times it was painful going anywhere with him, he was just so awkward. He came from a rural area, worked away 6 months of the year with hardly any social interaction but was a really kind trustworthy guy who would have done anything for me.\n\nOnce I had encouraged him to go to the gym and a year or two down the line, with the fitness, working through his anxiety issues and him gaining confidence at times I did think to myself that I had created a monster, not in a horrible way, but probably made him become very vain and obsessed with his looks, especially as when I first met him I used to see girls staring and whispering about him to each other everywhere we went, he was absolutely oblivious to this and would get embarrassed when I told him.\n\nHis new wife must have limited his gym time though as he lost a lot of that muscle he worked so hard to gain, she changed his hairstyle and how he dressed and had him looking like a member of a boy band!  \n\nThe one thing that honestly shocked me was that he wanted to keep in contact with me even though they had a baby on the way, emails still had sexual context in a roundabout way, thinking it was OK to meet for lunch and trying to justify it by saying that we were just friends so totally innocent. I would have never ever thought of him as that type of guy. I trusted him 100% when we were together. \n\nI don't have any bad feelings towards him at all, I don't have any feelings good or bad. I can't even remember the last time he crossed my mind until I saw this post.",
            "Thanks.\n\nI honestly hope he is happy, I have no feelings for him at all anymore.  They are still together and have two kids as far as I know. I have seen the odd picture of him now and then on social media and he doesn't even look like the same guy anymore. He looks a lot older and sort of worn out. \n\nShe was more interested in his money than anything else, he wanted to stop working offshore when his baby was born so he would see her growing, my replacement wouldn't allow it, she thought the money he earned was more important. Surely most first time mothers would rather have their partner at home than leaving them on their own with a baby for months at a time?\n\nIn those four years I was with him I never took a single penny ever, I still took my turn paying for dinner, buying drinks etc. I had no interest in what he had. I had no idea he was well off for months after I met him, I did know he worked away but didn't ask all the details \n\nIm pretty sure he missed me for a long time, not that it matters now anyway \ud83d\ude0a",

            "He just wasn\u2019t that into you.\n\nHe wanted to have sex with you, so he told you what your wanted to hear to get it. \n\nOnce he had it, he decided he didn\u2019t want to be monogamous with you.\n\nThe why\u2019s and motives behind those decisions aren\u2019t that important, atleast they likely aren\u2019t a reflection on you, they are a reflection on him.\n\nLearn what you can from the experience and move on.",
            "Maybe it wasn\u2019t ever going that great though? If he tricked you into sleeping with him the first time by acting like he was down to be monogamous only to never initiate a text convo with you again following said first sexual encounter and also gave you the same lame excuse to not hang out for 3 straight weeks, I don\u2019t see where he\u2019s done anything positive? He responds to your texts, sure but what\u2019s the tone? Is he enthusiastic? If he\u2019s making excuses AND not hitting you up, that\u2019s a dealbreaker. Forget his ass and find someone who\u2019s as excited to talk to you as you are to them. I say this with love because very similar experience\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
            "I\u2019ll just focus on the still answering your texts because others addressed the rest well.  He\u2019s trying to keep the door open so that you might hook up with him down the road",
            "If he wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship why was he dating you then?? Your time and emotions didn\u2019t matter to him. He wasn\u2019t into you. That is the only reason he wasn\u2019t \u201c\u201dready\u201d\u201d to commit to you. If a guy wanted to, he would. This is *always* true. \n\nApparently your particular guy later wanted to (but definitely wasn\u2019t wanting you in the time he told you \u201cI\u2019m not ready\u201d) but I really question the reasons and whether it was genuine or simply not finding someone else whom he deems \u201cbetter\u201d and settling so he won\u2019t be alone.",
            "Thanks for your response. Yes I heard about guys who weren't that popular even though they have so much potential. But when it's revealed, they start to notice all the attention they get and sometimes that can be intoxicating. It's a great feeling to know as a guy that you can fuck any girl tbh",
            "I think the red flag there was at 32 and no previous relationship- no woman wanted him.",
            "See my reply to the other poster and see if you still think he was just a skeeze. I\u2019m not sure what I could learn from this other than maybe wait even longer to have sex? \ud83e\udd74\ud83d\ude41. And why bread crumb me for 4 weeks. Why not just ghost like a not a f boy. Sorry. This is just the first time this has ever happened to me. Guys usually like me to much and get to clingy to fast.",
            "He was very enthusiastic in his texts back. He took me to nice places. When I came over for the weekend he told Me to stay as long as I wanted. He blew his friends off to see me. The first time we talked, we talked until almost 6 in the morning. He kept saying we click so well. We have such great chemistry. You have the perfect body. You are so sweet. We are both atheist in a country where 98% of the people are very religious. I actually prefer to date men that let me have my space and freedom and don\u2019t need to hang out or text constantly. I don\u2019t know if this is important, but I wasn\u2019t able to cum either time we had sex and he took it personally. Thank you for your response though. You made very good points for me to think about.",
            "It seems that you view the world through a very black and white lens with no room for any gray area. I can understand why someone with little-to-no information would be quick to assume that lack of immediate commitment = disinterest in my situation. All of his actions led me to believe he had an interest in me, and at the time I also hadn\u2019t planned on entering something super serious, so him not wanting to commit right away wasn\u2019t a problem for me. I also had serious concerns before I was ready to be in something long term with him, again, due to external factors. I am not someone who has struggled to get the attention of men, nor were my own options limited, so the idea that either of us settled is an assumption based on your own biased perception. But even if someone\u2019s interest grows over time, there is nothing inherently wrong with this. Unfortunately, not everyone has those \u201clove at first sight\u201d feelings and there\u2019s nothing wrong with something that builds up over time. There\u2019s no need to villainize it.",
            "I didn\u2019t say he was a skeeze.\n\nJust that he wasn\u2019t as into you as you were him.\n\nOr maybe he was into you, then he met someone he decided he was more into.\n\nOr maybe something really did come up in his personal life and his priorities changed.\n\nThe lesson to learn is to believe what people\u2019s actions are telling you, rather than just their words. Words can often be correct for their intentions, but their actions will show you their true priorities.\n\nFor example; \n\nhis words were that he wanted a relationship with you, and that may have genuinely been his intention at the time he said them.\n\nBut his actions were that he told you what you wanted to hear so that you would sleep with him, and then once he got what he wanted, his priorities shifted.\n\nIf/when he comes back, you have (hopefully) learnt to not believe what he says. Because he has already shown you that his word means little.\n\nEdit; after reading your other comments, words vs actions are 100% the correct lesson to take from this. Old mate love bombed you and told you exactly what you were looking to hear to get into your pants.",
            "Pay attention to \u201cfuture faking\u201d too. When someone talks about things you\u2019ll do as a couple or talk about future plans or activities or places you can go. That\u2019s painting a picture in your head and getting you hooked on the idea of a future that most likely will never be. \n\nMake sure anyone you are talking to or getting to know stays firmly in reality. And, if they make claims like \u201cWe should go to this restaurant (or whatever) I love sometime. Their milkshakes are great. We\u2019d have fun.\u201d Pay close attention. If that restaurant visit never seems to happen\u2026. You\u2019re being future faked. \n\nPay close attention to people who stay in the present, plan activities with you (and actually show up) in the present, and don\u2019t paint imagery about things with you you can\u2019t guarantee will even happen.",
            "lol wow, same here about hitting it off/atheism/preferring space/not being smothered/and that very last part \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude02 weird! In my personal experience, dude was major avoidant attachment style, we also both have intimacy issues (emotionally), he\u2019s probably still in love with his ex, he loses interest after every time we sleep together but once we go long enough he\u2019s right back into putting all the original effort in (I guess because it\u2019s a novelty at that point)? But I 100% did this to myself by never setting strict boundaries and also allowing it to go on for hmmm\u20265+ years now \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude16 Whatever the reason is that your dude is going cold on you, just know it\u2019s not you.

In fact, if I don\u2019t like someone a lot, sex is the last thing I want to do with them!

            "It might seem like everyone loses their virginity in their teens but the reality is no one is posting as often about not being a virgin vs the people posting that they had sex. Lots of people don't have sex til their 20s or 30s, personally I think in many ways it's better that way. You will be more matured and handling the vast amount of emotions and feelings that comes along with sex can be challenging when you are younger. You're not missing out on anything, sex is only fun when you are with someone you actually want to be with and that is reciprocated. It's not worth chasing it out just to fulfill it, although there is nothing wrong with that if you really want to one day. That said I wouldn't lie about it, it will only further complicate things if you end up progressing into a relationship and have to tell someone the truth at some point. Also a lot of people actually enjoy being with a virgin compared to someone who's slept around a lot. For all you know, the first person you ever sleep with could be a virgin as well, and you telling them that could make them more comfortable.",

Why not disclosing your activity to the person that you plan on being sexually intimate with, you may give him a false sense of his sexual well-being. He may proceeded to be intimate with other women I have potentially put them at risk. This is a dark, grim example, but it is a possibility. Also, if you plan on me being a serious relationship with this person, it may cause problems to you down the line if you decide to tell them the truth. They may not take it as lightly as you think.",
            "Virgins on Reddit need to stop thinking that this is an issue. It\u2019s a non issue. You just haven\u2019t done it yet. Of course it\u2019s normal to not have done something yet. You\u2019re only 21.\n\nVirgin means child. You are not a child. You will lose it eventually but don\u2019t get in your head about it. Also, you don\u2019t need to announce it to the world and make it a huge thing. Everyone has their own time. Don\u2019t compare yourself to others. Some people wish they had waited a little longer. You never know how everyone\u2019s first times were just because they did it first. It\u2019s not a competition. In the grand scheme of things it doesn\u2019t matter. Once you have sex you will see what a non issue is.",

            "No. The people that don't experience any type of akwardness and pain dyring their first time are few. You need to acknowledge (and not be ashamed at all!) that you are a virgin so the other person can be respectful and patient with you.\nI lost mine at 24 with someone \"experienced\" who was glad I told him so he can take it slow at first, my boyfriend lost it at 26 and had a couple mishaps during the first time. None of it is embarrassing.",

If u lie then they\u2019ll probably just think you\u2019re really bad at sex lol, also like it\u2019s your first time you want that to go a lil more chill. Communication is always super Important. If someone makes fun of you for it\u2026 then why tf would u wanna sleep with them anyways??? Pick someone who likes who you are and isn\u2019t gonna judge u over something that is normal.",

At the same time, you also don\u2019t want to be the guy who goes 6 months without sex. My advice is to stop putting so much \u201cI want it to be special\u201d into it. Get it out of the way with someone and move on.",

I\u2019m [alarmingly] direct. \n\n1. If you can\u2019t fix it feature it is to say if there\u2019s something about you which you fundamentally can\u2019t or won\u2019t alter\u2026 is incentive for you to let people know it\u2019s a thing about you! This particular thing will make you YOU and you\u2019ll be surprised how many people will be endeared and even appreciative of that thing about you. \n\nRemember: there are three themes of personal abandonment most people don\u2019t realize they live by: fitting in, settling down, and growing up. \n\n2. Direct and forthright communication is an awesome policy. Although it often takes lots of experience to realize this. So keep this in the back of your mind. Be completely direct with people. Be truthful. It doesn\u2019t mean be harsh. There\u2019s lots of ways to tell people in ways they can appreciate that\u2019s true. Those who don\u2019t like it, will at least appreciate you for who YOU are whether or not they want you around. It doesn\u2019t matter to you because you won\u2019t want to be around those people!",

And it certainly wouldn't ruin anything for me. Don't be embarrassed and don't pretend just to fit in.\n\nYou should grab yourself by the neck and stop being ashamed of being innocent. Every decent man worth spending your love and time with will treat you and your body the same virgin or not. With passion and care, you telling them you are a virgin I would assume is only a good thing. A man will better be able to pleasure you knowing what you have done before.\n\nI personally like to take it 4-5 times gentler and spend 2-3 times longer on foreplay if my partner is inexperienced. What I'm trying to say is a decent man will treat your body like that of a woman they are deeply in love in an effort to protect you and guide the experience.\n\nIf I dated a woman I knew was a virgin. When we had sex for the first time I would treat her like my wife of 5 years. As opposed to if I dated a woman I knew had 15 bodies and over 1000hours of sexual experience, when it came time to have sex for the first time with her I would be far rougher and much more bold with what I do.\n\nTLDR \n\nAt the end of the day it's not that deep. If a man loves you he will take care of you in your own preferred way. Make sure to communicate atlot and not to be afraid of the unknown. Also fuck your friends are assholes if they genuenly bully you and make you feel bad for being a virgin.",

The best sex is had when both parties can say what they are/aren't enjoying, and/or giving directions to the other.\n\nBeing a virgin just means you are inexperienced, which means you don't know what you like and how you like it (+what/how he likes it either, but that's for him to say).

One thing she did only 3 months into the relationship was she went to a gig in another country with her best friend who's a guy and apparently has a girlfriend. \n\nShe got a hotel with him and they shared a room to save money. Fine, fair enough, that's reasonable. \n\nThis is where things get shady for me. She never told me they'd be doing that or asked if I'd be comfortable with it. I find out because she posted a instagram story with her in bed and he's asleep in what appears to be the same bed.\n\nWhen I confronted her, she firstly started gaslighting me. Saying it's not a big deal, I'm insecure, I don't trust her etc etc. She then said that they pushed the beds apart before but it really didn't look like it from the instagram story. She then lied and said his girlfriend doesn't see it as a problem but then said she's never spoken to her.\n\nAnyway, afterwards, I gave her the benefit of the doubt and understood that we make mistakes and felt like she probably hasn't cheated but poorly communicated and tried to claw herself out of a hole. \n\nAfter though, which is not related to the breakup, I spent quite a few months being paranoid that she was cheating and had a lot of anxiety about it. There were small little things that happened that made me instantly jump to conclusions that she's cheating even if she might have not been.\n\n1 being she worked as a stage hand at a music venue. She brought home some flowers one night and said it was from the venue cos they were going to throw them. 2nd time was she found a random guys shirt in her room and didn't understand where ir came from, but she actually showed it to me. Would a guilty person show it to someone deliberately? She said the next day she brought it into work and asked a colleague who said it was from the lost property section and she must have taken it from there.\n\nIt took me a while to trust her, but I was deeply convinced she was cheating until so many months had passed and nothing weird like that ever happened again.\n\nWe eventually split up 9 months after this for completely different reasons. \n\nUpon reflection, she's showing signs she wants to get back together but I'm not currently taking the bait. \n\nHave I dodged a bullet here? Do you think it's likely she cheated or am I being paranoid / insecure? ",

            "I think you dodged a bullet here. It's obvious that she's lying and trying to spin a story since she can't keep her story straight. She also manipulated you and deceived you. Even if she didn't cheat, I'd consider that complete lack of communication to be a red flag.\u00a0",
            "Once she caught an attitude about you catching her omitting a detail like sleeping in the same bed as another hetero dude and gaslighting the absolute fuck out of you...it was over. She didn't respect you and was playing in your face. You absolutely dodged a bullet. Ain't nothing insecure about wanting your partner to not sleep in the same bed as someone of the opposite sex. Nahhhhhh...she tried the fuck out of you with that shit lol",
            "As a female who has had several male besties in the past - I have never, ever dreamed of sharing a bed with them. I also would tell my boyfriend about sharing a room with my bestie. She cheated.\n\nShe also habitually lied. why do you want to go back to this?",
            "How many times do we have to hear about women f*cking thier best male friend, but when a guy sets up some boundaries, then they get gas lighted as insecure.\n\nThe guys who are totally happy to be a best friend with a women with a hope of getting sex is a 100% certified loser, because deep down they know they are being used and are OK with it, because they don\u2019t value themselves.",

Maybe she is a bit of a free spirit, and she is a faithful person.  BUT, the doubt she will continually bring into any relationship through her actions will be exhausting and upsetting.",

I would have drawn the line at staying the night with another man without any form of prior communication, it's a breach of trust if you're in an exclusive relationship. Finding a shirt, unless you believe it materialized there, she either brought it home at some point or had someone there.

How annoying to deal with all that by being constantly compared and them talking secretly to each other..\n\nI couldn't think of anything more annoying than that. I'm surprised some young boys are willing to keep up with this bs.\n\nYou have dodged a bullet, but not because she might have hooked up with him, no.\n\nYou dodged it because she seems to have an awful personality, especially trying to gaslight instead of reflecting the issues that you have concerns as her boyfriend.",

            "Purposely posting a social media picture of her in bed with another dude is insane. She's provoking you to break up with her and you completely whiffed on it, crazy to be so naive, and even crazier to be so utterly naive that you'd consider getting back together with her even after this \"reflecting\" you're doing",
            "I'm coming from a different perspective from everyone else. People saying she 100% cheated either have limited life experience or have been hurt before.\n\nDo I think she cheated, no. She hasn't hid anything.\n\nDo I think she has done wrong. No\n\nShould she not do it? Probably.\n\nI have a group of friends that are pretty much family at this point. We have all known each other for around 16 years, we all grew up together. It consists of men and women and most of them are now married with kids with a few engaged. \n\nWe are all super close and I have shared beds with some of the women many many times in a totally platonic way. We know it's platonic, we don't see It as \"I'm a man, you woman, sharing bed bad\" we are adults and totally capable of laying next to the opposite gender without our ape brains taking over.\n\nThat being said, just because we are comfortable with it doesn't mean others should be. From my experience our group has a super unique experience and are bonded through good times, bad times, trauma, death, time and understanding. But I see most people do not have anything like this. So even though we know and care for eachother deeply that sleeping in the same bed is a null issue and never crosses our mind as a weird thing. I am fully aware I come from a pretty unique perspective and if I'm in a relationship, try to avoid this happening for my partner's sanity.\n\nThat being said if I had to fork out say $300 for an extra hotel room. You can for sure bet I'll be sleeping in the same with a friend from opposite gender.\n\nPeople are saying you Dodge a bullet, I disagree. It seems like she's open and tells you and shows you everything. Just bad judgment every now and then.",
            "Come on dude. She slept with him. Nobody is going to stay in the same hotel room with an opposite sex best friend, without telling their partner and engage in non-sexual behavior.\u00a0",
            "At 3 months if you were commited, she should have told you in advance.  All u have is her word and the only response you know is because you saw it on social media. She said the beds were apart, but the picture didn't show it.  I'm sorry, but I would have ended the relationship right there.  Open and honest communication, as well as taking your partners feelings/emotions into account before doing something are essential to a successful LTR.  Yes, your partner sharing a hotel room as a person of the opposite sex without mentioning it is definitely not being open and honest in communication and not trustworthy. How many other things has she done that u haven't stumbled across that she hasn't told you about?",

If someone is cheating, they try to hide it. Nevertheless, it's hard to deal with all this stuff thrown at you, but I do believe it can be worked out.",
            "Listen from personal experiences from 3 very suspicious relationships in my life. There isn't really a thing called being directly insecure brother. For me and at the end of the day you just want to make sure the relationship you are in is safe and secure, bc that is what men need. A long story short, don't trust your girls male best friend until you two have met alone and spent a day together. Highly reccomend btw, you can tell alot about your girl by how their friends act when they're not there, also you might get a friend for life something i was fortunate to do in one of the instances in my life. Other than that, don't ignore your gut feelings in a relationship, doing that often gets you bit hard",

            "Always trust your gut.  She was cheating.  \n\nTo be somewhat fair.  If a person is not putting up reasonable guardrails to protect their relationship they will eventually cheat.  Human sexual desire is innate.  No one is above reproach!\n\nSo if monotony is very important to you.  (It\u2019s not for everyone). Talk with your partner about what guardrails you expect of each other.  Especially if one or both of you travel for work.  Probably the most common time people cheat.",

These are friends that I know since a very young age and there have never been any romantic feelings from either side ever.  However I do think these things should have to be discussed in a relationship. My boyfriend knew my friends well and did not have a problem with it. Honesty is important to me in a relationship. I would be more concerned about the lying if I were you.\n\nThat being said. Stop winding yourself up about possible cheating. First of all the relationship is over. Second of all if someone does cheat it does not say anything about you (but everything about the cheating person). And lastly you cannot ever controle someone. If someone wants to cheat they will do it anyway.",

            "It's funny how grown adults don't ask permission to do shit when they know they're trustworthy. Then when their partner freaks out they backpedal and lie just like kids do when they know their parents won't approve or didn't grant permission for something. Work on your trust issues before you get involved with anyone whether it's this ex or a new person. You seem to spend a lot of time imagining worst case scenarios and that's not a healthy way to live.",
            "I think you sound paranoid but maybe there\u2019s more to this than what you\u2019ve written. Should she have told you about the shared room? Definitely, but it doesn\u2019t sound like they shared a bed (you\u2019re just speculating). If they did, that\u2019s suspicious but I have male friends where we could do that platonically just like with my girlfriends.\n\nThe flowers thing makes sense for throwing them at the venue. Crew always leaves with something in those cases, and someone taking flowers home is better than throwing them out. For the shirt, if it was someone she was seeing who left the shirt she\u2019d be the dumbest cheater in the world to be asking you about it knowing where it came from.\n\nThe fact you\u2019re thinking about this after you\u2019ve broken up tells me\u2026it was all in your head.

            "Agree, why put up with that shit, she didn\u2019t respect you enough to tell you and you had to find out with her posting. That is some manipulative bullshit. Lying can be positive or negative in action, she didn\u2019t tell you, when she KNEW she should, that\u2019s lying to me bro.",
            "Maybe you're right there. Well we moved past all of this 9 months later but then broke up for different reasons. A part of me just thought she sucked at communicating and made a mistake.

            "That's good to hear, to be honest.\n\n Ah it's a long story. But to summarise. Long distance. Was meant to live in Germany with her. Had to go back home due to personal reasons. Funeral for a close friend, health scare to name a few. Which led to a serious burnout I was suffering from. I was due to fly back to Germany for her family's wedding. I told her idk if I can fly anymore and am mentally struggling with it, and she basically replied with a snide remark saying it was my own fault and then went to bed. I immediately tried to call her and she ignored me for the rest of the night. \n\nSo the next day, I in anger said I'm not going to the wedding. So she told her family to un invite me, and by the time I calmed down, it was too late I was un invited. That was ultimately the beginning of the end. A few more things happened after that but again it's a long story.",

            "It's a difficult one because they were friends long before I was around. She did actually end up not talking to him anymore after that cos she knew it made me uncomfortable. However, here's another slight red flag. When we first got together, he told her he's concerned that she's rushing into something with me.\n\nAnd yeah I think you could be right about that. The funny thing is I haven't even told you the half of it. Though I'm far from perfect and could have handled things better,  how it ended basically proved that she has no empathy towards anyone. The gaslighting got worse. The thing that haunts me, though, is wondering if she ever did cheat on me.",
            "My thought process was maybe she posted it because she was innocent and genuinely didn't think she was doing anything wrong. It did make me look like a fool though for sure. I very very nearly broke up with her then and there. But I gave her a chance. 9 months later we broke up for something unrelated to that. We had some really good times, I don't think I will get back together, but I'm still always wondering if she did cheat.",
            "Thanks for the perspective. I can understand this. The only bit I don't agree with is the last part. The problem I had was that she didn't tell me. I had to find out from her posting a story on IG which I still find weird to this day. Which she then started lying and gaslighting rather than listening to my pov and acknowledged. It was an early sign that she has a lack of empathy. As I mentioned before she is a bit of a jekel and Hyde character. She can be open but not always. It would put my mind at ease for sure though if I knew that nothing happened.\n\nAs for the other things that happened 9 months later that led to the breakup, I'm unsure there's any way back anywhere or if I should even entertain getting back together.",
            "I nearly did tbh, I really nearly did. She said to me when we first got together, pinky promise we tell each other everything. She didn't uphold her end of the bargain.  And yeah that's my thinking. And if we was together in the future, would this happen again?",
            "Hmm possibly. I was her first serious relationship as guys in the past have basically just used her. So I did sort of give her the benefit of the doubt that it might just be lack of experience with these sorts of things. She's 28 and I'm 31 btw.",
            "Sounds like you have done kind of army fetish! Lol!",
            "Understandable. It requires a lot of trust in someone to be comfortable with your partner sharing a bed with someone else. I would have been OK with it if she was upfront about it early on. For sure the lying was a huge concern. \n\nI think I just wanted to hear different opinions on this because there's a few things that have happened in the past where I'm questioning my own judgement and if I can't see clearly, then I shouldn't dare entertain the possibility of getting back together. I think it's a bad idea anyway to go back.",
            "A part of me feels like this comment is gaslighting. If she would have asked, I would have been OK with it. It's the fact that she didn't ask or even just tell me. Then on top of that, rather than listening to my feelings and saying, OK fair enough, my bad, I will make sure to ask next time. She tried to lie and call me insecure. That's the things I couldn't shake. It took me a while to trust her after that. The actual breakup was 9 months later and had nothing to do with this. I was with her for 1 year. My relationship before that I was in it for 8 years with someone and I never once didn't trust her or was paranoid about her.",
            "Yeah sorry but there\u2019s no scenario where I\u2019d be comfortable with my partner sharing a bed with the \u201cguy best friend\u201d and NOT telling me about it, changing the story, and then calling me insecure. OP was 100% justified being worried the way he was and there\u2019s no paranoia there lol. Would you be comfortable with your *male* partner sleeping with the \u201cstrictly platonic female friend\u201d?",
            "The reason why I am thinking this is because I'm rewinding back to things and using that logic to see if it's even worth exploring the possibility of getting back together. But this particular thing is something I still think is a mystery, so I wanted second opinions without bias. \n\nWe broke up 9 months after this. We was together for a year and we broke up because of something completely unrelated to this. \n\nBasically long story short. I was supposed to live with her in Germany but some personal stuff happened to me like the death of someone close and a health scare that I had to go home. I was supposed to go to her family's wedding a few weeks later. It took it's toll on me and I suggested to her idk if I can do anymore flying. I had flown so much in a 6 weeks. She gave me a snide reply saying it's my fault \ud83d\ude05 and then went to bed. And I tried to immediately call her and she ignored the calls. \n\nNext day in anger I told her I'm not going to the wedding. She told her family to un invite me. I calmed down and by that point it was too late I was un invited. That was the beginning of the end. More happened but I won't go into it. \n\nIn summary though. I made mistakes like a human being with feelings would. But she had zero empathy for anything I was going through.\n\nFair points about the paranoia. Personally I think for me to have the view points I have are reasonable and judging by the responses on here, many agree. It's a grey area where it could be completely explainable or it's cheating. That's why I asked it on here. Also, I'm not \"just speculating\". I saw the video on her IG story. The beds didn't look apart at all. It looked like the same bed. No it wasn't 100% conclusive, but it appeared that way and didn't add up with her narrative that they \"pushed the beds apart\".",
            "That lack of empathy is huge. There is no working with someone who lacks empathy. And if they do they might also lack remorse which is a perfect recipe for a cheater and abuser.",

            "I do not understand the psychology of why she (and people in general) do this",
            "Curious what reasons you would have for getting back together with her? She doesn\u2019t seem very nice.",
            "Stop wondering. She cheated 200%. Even if she didn\u2019t cheat, just sleeping in the same bed with another man is a non starter for me. I don\u2019t care if they are long time friends, school mates from 1962 or even family members! An adult male and female should not be sleeping in the same bed unless they are \u201ctogether\u201d. Get rid of her man. She is trouble. And then gas lighting you??? Seriously? You don\u2019t need that! Get rid of her pronto. There is no future with a person like that. None.",
            "Ah yea I see. I guess the thing is to her it may be a null issue. So she didn't think to tell you. If she did something sinister she wouldn't have posted it on IG. Again though even though it may be a null issue to her, she does need to understand that not everyone is comfortable with scenarios like that and that she should have maybe thought about your perspective and should have told you first. But this (at the time) was a new relationship so you can't know each others perspective on everything. These sort of things can be fixed with a conversation on understanding each other's perspective and respecting it. Then at that point, if she didn't/ Dosent understand yours and respect it. Then it's a red flag. The ideal outcome is you guys talked about it. You said it's fine to do that but tell me first next time. Then if she said \"that's fine I will\" then the problem is solved. \n\nAt the end of the day life is unpredictable and so are relationships. It just comes down to do you like this girl enough and can you have open conversations and get through rough patches together. I know people that have been married for like a decade and misunderstandings and lack of awareness of eachothers perspective still happen. One of my best mates (female, not part of my group) has a husband who I now know well. From the outside IV always seen their 14 year relationship as perfect. He always treated her perfectly, super nice guy always spoke highly of her. Long story short, They had their first child, 6 months after i get a phone call at 4am. He cheated on her. All unraveld that he was super depressed, was a secret alcoholic and was contemplating suicide. He went to theropy, they went couples theropy and now they good.\n\nMoral of that story is life is unpredictable, people are unpredictable, understanding people is hard, you can't control anyone, you can't be inside someone else's head. Relationships are work, not just at the start but the whole time. You just have to do the best with what's in front of you now. If you don't realise relationships are work and expect them to be all flowers and rainbows, your not ready for a relationship and you need to work on you. \n\nDo you think you guys can be open with each other with eachother? Do you think you'll be able to curb your paranoia? If the answer is no to one of these then move on. If it is yes to both give it a shot.\n\nI lost an amazing relationship because of my own paranoia (was a druggy at the time to be fair) and I was wrong about all of it. I hands down would still be with her now if I was older and wiser at that point.\n\nIV been where you've been. Don't end up like me and alone in your mid to late 30's because you're scared about getting hurt or worried about things that may never happen. IV pushed away a lot of women that loved me because iv always assumed they would inevitably hurt me. Taking the risk with the potential of getting hurt (which may never happen) is way better than nearing 40, living with another man and wanking yourself to sleep every night.\n\nGood luck, whatever you do I hope it works out.",

            "I think she's a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde character. I did have some great memories with her. I do wonder if it was all a lie. But it's hard to shake it and it's exhausting to have to start again getting to know someone all again. So maybe a part of me thinks it's worth being open minded. But there are some big things she's shown that she isn't a nice person, absolutely. I just hoped that she's made mistakes, just like I also make mistakes and that she didn't mean to be like that. Idk.",
            "Yeah you're spot on. I think the issue before was the lying and gaslighting. But it doesn't mean she cheated no. It's a grey area I think. Relationships are hard work, ours really was. People are complicated and our relationship was complicated at many times. \n\nThere is a lot more to this than just what I posted but this was the incident that I still wonder about. But isn't the reason we split up 9 months later. That's a whole different issue which I might end up doing another post about tbh.\n\nThanks for the advice mate, really appreciate it. And I hope that it does work out for you. Keep bettering yourself and building up the confidence, be out as much as possible or try a different approach to life and I'm sure everything will work out for you. Seems like you're from the UK, I know how hard the dating scene is in the UK atm.",
            "Good for you man. That sounds very healthy. Empathy and openess is definitely the traits to look for absolutely.",
            "For a lack of a better word I should have added. Well tbf, your original comment wasn't that helpful anyway.",
            "Dude my last ex was like that. Her being the most attractive I ever had also played into the rollercoaster of emotions she put me through. Having a stupid \"I can save/fix her\" complex didn't help. Combine it with her subtly implying that I'd never get better didn't help. \n\nAll I can say is a cold hard no contact is the best solution because otherwise she's going to drain what she can out of you until she finds something else. Doing it on your terms is the best option because if you wait until she does like I did it likely will lead to costly therapy.",
            "I don\u2019t know how old you guys are, but I can say from experience and with absolute confidence - don\u2019t settle cause you\u2019re afraid to start over. Good things take work, but it shouldn\u2019t be too much work. And it\u2019s never too late to pursue finding someone who sees you, respects you and appreciates you. Dating is exhausting, I get it. But don\u2019t settle. Life is so short. The world is too big.",
            "I agree lying is not great, but if you find me someone that is never lied to a partner, especially at early stages where it's just been months, I'll give you \u00a31,000,000. We all got baggage, see things different and lie for different reasons (usually to come across as the person you want to be, but not quite there yet).The important thing is to talk about it and find out why she lied.\n\nAt the end of the day, you're on here asking for advice so clearly you're considering the idea. No one on here including me, knows anything about you or her or the situation. People just assuming stuff and screaming red flag, you dodged a bullet. Such a narrow view based on so much lack of context. But from where I'm standing, I'd give it another shot. Worst case, she turns out to be a piece of work and you waste a few months. Best case you end up marrying the best woman for you and you live happily ever after. In heinsight, I know the risk id rather take.\n\nYea I'm from the UK. 100% dating scene sucks right now. Thanks for the kind words. Did a bunch of therapy a year back (life's not been kind to me \ud83d\ude05).  I'm in a good place, got the confidence, learnt from my mistakes. Finally understand the dynamics of relationships and understand where IV gone wrong on my end. Not bummed out about being single or alone anymore and when it happens it happens. Super optimistic. Although I do wish I understood what I do now just under a year ago when my girlfriend of 7 years broke up with me \ud83e\udd23 but that's life. Is what it is.\n\nHope it works out for you man. You seem like a decent bloke.",
            "It's not what to look for, it's what is necessary.",
            "Oh I'm so sorry my free advice wasn't up to your standards. No wonder you felt it was fine to call me a gaslighter.\n\nWork on yourself. You need it.",
            "Yeah agreed fully. It should be a requirement in any future partner.",
            "I am continuously working on myself thanks. Quite happy with how I'm developing in my creative ventures. I just don't really appreciate your stance.",
            "You: Am I being paranoid?\n\nMe: Have you considered...\n\nYou: GASLIGHTER\n\nYou only want to hear from people who will spout identical stuff that you want to hear. That's not how one works on oneself but you sure picked the right sub to post on as everyone else here, who has zero experience of being a woman with male friends or being  a male with close female friends, will tell you EXACTLY what you want to hear.\n\nBye.",
            "No I'm totally open to being called paranoid etc. Hence why I asked the question. I'm actually hoping I am being paranoid. It's your general attitude. Your original comment had a shitty attitude to it and dismissed how I was feeling. You can say I should work on my trust issues without being a dick about it and without the attitude. Your comment had attitude that wasn't needed.",
            "Dude, you\u2019re not paranoid, the person you are responding to is delusional. Look at their comment history for 5 mins and trust your gut on this one.",
            "Free critique of how I choose to express my opinion! It's my lucky day! Thanks so much. \n\nNow you've called me a gaslighter and a dick all because you didn't care for my opinion, which you asked for.\n\nAgain---bye.",
            "Thanks dude yeah I think you're right there."
