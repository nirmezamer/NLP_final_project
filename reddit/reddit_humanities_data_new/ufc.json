            "Well, you did not deny that my previous comment was false in any regard. \n\nYou are 100% a Reddit Moderator and proud. \n\nCongrats, I guess?\u2026good luck with that and have a nice evening. Or morning.",
            "I was hoping for strickland pic, dissapointed",
            "It's funny because the original comment seems superficially supportive of Jon, but Jon himself would hate it because it implies the rumours that he is gay are true. It's not directly relevant to the custody thing, it just used it as an excuse to make the joke.",
