            "Underrated ARPG and a very unique mechanic. In some ways it almost feels like the old Baldur's Gate games except you only control one character at a time so it's less like an RTS where you have to micromanage a bunch of different characters at once.",

            "[removed]",
            "The issue with playing this after stuff like Grim Dawn, Path of Exile, or heck, even Diablo 4 is that everything about it feels so feeble. The movements, the attacking, everything is just bland and feels weak and boring. There's no \"just one more enemy\" like the those games. It's a trudge.",

It's plenty of fun with decent characters and story with good lore. It's also a bit rough around the edges and not really breaking any new ground beyond the puppet system. Speaking of, the puppet system is fun, and forces you to play through your roster to prevent monotony. The skill system is nothing special and loot is looty.\n\nOverall, solid 7/10.",

            "I agree, I quite liked this game. But did you just steal the current top steam review to come up with this comment?",
            "Interestingly, I don't really like those games you mentioned, but I liked this one. \n\nShadows: Awakening feels like it was made to be played on a controller, while a lot of other ARPGs on PC need a mouse, and I just can't handle the repetitive movements.",
            "I only poked around but I didn't get the sense that's what it was going for.  The other ones throw mobs and mobs of enemies at you that you churn through and massively delete.  The pace here was slower, more like a dungeon crawl than a Path of Exile.",
            "They are different type of games from the same genre. I can't stand PoE or Grim Dawn for the repetitive numb gameplay of pressing 1 button to kill everything on the screen for the 1000000th time. \n\nThis game focuses more on story and your choices affect which characters you can play as.",
            "Modern problems, modern solutions.",
            "It inspired my comment, its a very good to the point review about this game.",
            "Yeah. I enjoyed combat a lot more in Shadows compared to most ARPGs. It felt more tactical (rather than just spamming abilities). I would actually compare it a little bit to the old Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance console games which were also designed for controller players.",
            "!   \n\nIf this is seemingly designed around controller inputs, that's a big win! I have a hand injury that makes kb+m games a complete nightmare, and RTS games have always tended to forgo even adapting for controller inputs.",
            "More like ancient solution to modern problem. Mail filtering was a thing for a long time.",
            "Same\u2026. Kb+m kills me too..",
            "Don't at least Diablo and grim dawn play on controllers also?  Not sure about poe, since I never played it, but both gd and Diablo play well on deck",
            "PoE devs are intent on not supporting controllers. But they're building it into a future release, so maybe they're tired of getting dunked on...",
            "I played PoE on controller. It wasn\u2019t great, but somewhat doable.",
            "Yeah, it's possible, but not supported/encouraged by the devs. Became a topic w/ the Steam controllers, and the devs were like, \"yeah, you can get close, but it's not kb/m, so we're not gonna do anything to make anyone's life easier.\" Like disabled gamers can go get fucked in their eyes.",
            "It was a pain to keep swapping back to kb/m for inventory, crafting, and similar tasks. It will be nice if PoE2 has way better support."

With how much stuff is exclusive to each platform, it's quite frustrating to want to buy any of them.  I want to play resident evil but it's only on Playstation. I want to play some of the Jurassic park ones but they're only on meta.  So I'm afraid of everything I buy is going to be locked out of the other platforms.  \n\nIt's a good bundle. I'm just griping on the current state of VR gaming.",

            "* Prey & Dishonored collection are a steal at this price if you don't already have them.\n* WRATH is a great deal for anyone into Boomer Shooters.\n* Kingdom Come: Deliverance is not my cup of tea from everything I heard about it, but people into this specific kind of role playing seem to like it a lot.\n\nDunno much about the rest.",
            "Do yourself a favor and get the dishonored trilogy, prey+dlc and kingdom come deliverance + dlc for 15 bucks. An absolute steal, it's so good that it barely makes sense",
            "You know what, this is the first good Fanatical bundle I have seen in a while. Too bad I already own enough here I couldn't fill out the 3 game minimum.",
            "I may have just bought Symphony of War and it\u2019s DLC yesterday for the entry price to this bundle \ud83d\ude2d",
            "I played through 'Death Trick: Double Blind' a couple of weeks ago and was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I highly recommend it to fans of Ace Attorney and similar games.",
            "any suggestions for 2 more games? I wanna get fo76 but not sure what to add on. I have all dishonored games and prey (amazing games)",
            "How does the Dishonored key(s) work? I already have the first one, do they come separate and I can give it to a friend? Or is it all or nothing",
            "How\u2019s Fallout 76? Does this include dlc for that or how do expansions work with that game?",
            "Absolutely  amazing bundle for this price",
            "I already own KIngdom Come Deliverance base game.Can I buy the royal edition ?",
            "Damn. I keep seeing symphony war in bundles, but can't find other games in the bundles I want (or I own other games). Also, the price listed is incorrect if it also comes with the DLC. It's actually worth more than 20.",
            "Recommendation for Kingdom Come (which is a great but difficult RPG): When you made it to the point you can train your fighting skill: use it.\nAnd the mace is extremely effective against enemies wearing heavy armor, which is...well, basically all the important ones.",
            "really only good for ppl new to PC gaming.  but for the ppl that peruse this subreddit we all already have the full or mixed collection of the AA/AAA games.  I only have the base game of **kingdom come** on GoG, but there are no other 2 games I want to have that I already own. \n\n'great bundle, except I already have them\", is the common consensus here, lulzz\n\nthe better indie games have already been bundled, and the rest of them are kinda meh.",
            "[removed]",
            "Symphony of War is painfully close to being a brilliant game. Definitely worth it.",
            "Good deal for sure, I was about to cave in until I realized I have Dishonored 2 for GOG from Prime, Dishonored Definitive from Epic, Death of the Outsider from Epic, Prey for GOG from Prime, Prey + Mooncrash from Epic and Kingdom Come Deliverance from Epic all for free. I'll probably still end up buying KCD Royal one day anyways for the DLC, but practically everything else I already own. Just a heads up to anyone else.",
            "Well I would, except 2 of those I got either free or for 3 EUR on prior Steam sales already..its insane how much AAA value is flying at you full speed if you just are patient.\nAnd now I have the super ironic problem that the 3 games I would pick are all...like, at best B to single A tier small budget games in comparison and 5 bucks a pop instead of 1-3 bucks in a \"lower level of games\" bundle.\nStill good prices, mind, but...weird. So weird.",
            "I agree that would be a pretty amazing bundle, if you don't already have them. My problem is that I do (well, I don't have the KCD DLC, but I've also still not actually gotten around to playing KCD anyway, and the DLC is often on sale for $6-7 on Steam). But outside of those, I'm having trouble finding anything that looks really good to me. \n\nI have played Shotgun King, it's alright. Would be great for a couple of buck. Not so much for $5.",
            "It's good for the \"big name\" titles for people who somehow don't already have them. \n\nThe more indie stuff, meh too expensive for needing to buy multiple games.",
            "Fanatical don't use to have greatly know triple AA but sometimes it's a paradise for double AA and Indies deals. I found some truly hidden gems on games I never heard of and I am pretty glad to check it often. (I'm not spamming or bot, just like the thing)",
            "Thank you for your sacrifice. Also, if it's on steam, you can probably refund it.",
            "Decent game, but towards the late game got boringly easy then you hit an absolutely massive difficulty cliff with the end boss.\n\nVery, very few games I drop on the last boss.  This was one.",
            "Kingdom Come Deliverance is a good deal for 5 bucks but it isn't for everyone. Sort of a hardcore-ish, grounded RPG. Combat is difficult and punishing.",
            "Shotgun King. It is is fun if you enjoy challenging turn based roguelikes based on chess.",
            "Fallout 76 expansions have so far been part of the game's core update cycles and they charge for MTX as their revenue maker.\n\n\nIt's worth $5 if you're desperate for a game to play now.",
            "You definitely can, but would be a waste since it comes with the base game as well but you'll only get the dlc. If you're ok with that then go ahead.",
            "The Royal upgrade package is available on Steam, but it's $6.99 on sale right now.",

            "I don't think the Prey that Epic gave away a while ago includes Mooncrash? I'm not sure but I checked and the one I claimed was the base edition.",
            "Yeah the games have been free multiple times but if anyone cares about having everything on a single platform (not that it matters with playnite), achievements, and stuff like that it's a great deal",
            "Yeah sometimes I feel like indie games are more expensive if you're a patient buyer lmao",
            "New genre dropped: Triple AA",
            "Thanks, but I bought through Fanatical.",
            "Thanks for the feedback. Journey before destination.",
            "will check it out, thanks",
            "appreciate the suggestion, I do love roguelikes",
            "Apparently it does. There is no Prey Mooncrash available on Epic Store. The base game itself comes with it. It's impossible not to get on the Epic Store. This also explains why the MSRP on Epic Store is higher than Steam.",
            "EA: *rubs hands together behind the tree*",
            "Oof, RIP. That's usually why it's a good idea to check if a game has been bundled before, since it's likely to be bundled again. \n\nBut hey, Symphony of War is a great game! Reminds me of the old Fire Emblem games in GBA which have imo the best animations.",
            "You know, I can\u2019t be mad. Still a great deal at $15 and I\u2019m excited to check it out. I\u2019ve heard great things including your endorsement!"
