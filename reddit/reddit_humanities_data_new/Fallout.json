            "The hacking of the overseers terminal was a cool nod to the game",
            "Man, the very last shot of this season has gotten my hopes so God damn high, I pray we get a season 2.",
            "Cool bit of irony I noticed.\u00a0\n\n\nBefore Lucy finds out what her dad did to Shady Sands, she says to Maximus \"if my dad found out that I destroyed an entire community to save him, that'd break his heart\".\u00a0\n\n\nOh my sweet summer child.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The cold fusion code is the date that Fallout 1 released: 101097. \n\nThought that was a nice nod.",
            "Coop Howard is Vault Boy???",
            "Wait so Lucy def fucked her cousin(s) right?",
            "I was surprised that they made stimpacks work like they do in the game (immediately repair anything). At first, I thought that was unrealistic. But then I remembered none of this is realistic, so I think it is actually a pretty cool addition.",
            "The final shot of the season gagged me to high heaven",
            "Played all the games; loved em.\n\nWatched the show: loved it.\n\nGuess I am in the minority here.",
            "You can call the vault tec number and there is screaming on the other line\n\n(213) 258-2858 \n\n(That's the number displayed during the commercial on episode 6)",
            "Bro they got the Junk jet on the first episode!",
            "I voted for Betty",
            "my one and only critic about this show is that they reused the maximus flashback so many times without showing any new footage or a continuation of his flashback. i expected some more interaction with the knight that inspired him to become one, or how his life was before the city got bombed, but through the entire series we saw the same flashback over and over again.. \n\nthe show is still a 9.8/10 for me and still better than the last of us, and i'm not even a fan of the games...",
            "Interconnected vaults seems like an interesting idea",
            "Just finished the show. Loved it. Although there are some loose threads, I still wonder why there was that weird cult scene worshiping Moldaver in vault 4. She never showed any signs of being any type of witch or anything like they said.",
            "Side question: Was that Mr. House in Episode 9? He was head of RobCo, iirc.",
            "Can we take a second to recognize the show for its accuracy of random encounters / side quest? i.e. When Maximus tried to save that guy in episode 1 or was it 2 from being killed only to find out the person he saved was \"fucking\" the other guy's chicken. It's those random events that made Fallout, Fallout.",
            ">!\\*When a Yao guai appears\\* !<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>!\"fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!\" -Lord Titus!<",
            "\"Thou shalt not be distracted by bullshit all the damn time\"\n\nI feel attacked.",
            "One weird thing which I don't see people really talking about, why are the ruins of Shady Sands so close to LA?",
            "I felt the feeling of the world was captured excellently. Some of the structure of the story was wonky, the lore off, but acting, CGI and sets seemed great with that touch of camp from the games.\u00a0\n\n\nOnly complaint I have is could you not have fucking cast Ron Perlman as one of the dudes in the secret meeting to just say the fucking line?\u00a0",
            "When the Vault 4 overseer puts on regular glasses, I absolutely died laughing. This show perfectly captures the combination of whimsical and grim the games are so good at.",
            "I'd like to imagine that some set designer accidentally wrote the wrong number on a chalkboard and the entire internet is up in arms about it.",
            "Honestly I just think that SS fell THEN it was nuked (Lonesome road ftw). I mean, a NCR vertibird is clearly shown in New Vegas, and also on the chalkboard is written FALL OF SHADY SANDS---->then the atomic mushroom. Maybe I'm coping super hard, but that's how I've interpreted",
            "DESTROYED WATER CHIP QUESTLINE YEEEEEEEEEEESSSSS",
            " Wait they released all episodes together ?",
            "Another thing. \n\nIf Vault-Tech is willing to nuke any new nations back into the sand, why do they not nuke the brotherhood of steel. You know, the powerful paramilitary organization whose obsessed with collecting and hoarding technology...who would likely ransack and destroy vault tech facilities....that brotherhood of steel.",
            "How in the balls is the enclave still around? The Brotherhood explicitly tried to exterminate them back in Broken Steel and yet they are back up and running with a big bespoke facility?\n\nI would normally accept it as having been rebuilt under the radar but the BoS is clearly aware of them or how would they know one of their scientists ran off with important materials?",
            "One thing I don\u2019t get is how no one recognized that all of the raiders in vault 32 were different from anyone they had met before. Supposedly they do this trade every 3 ish years or whatever and since we know the overseer has total control over all the vaults it\u2019s weird he wasn\u2019t aware that vault 32 was exterminated 2 years ago. Also I would have assumed that overseer would have recognized Moldaver from pre war but perhaps they never met? Idk. Seems confusing",
            "So, with regards to Episode 8, did every single BoS Knight just outright forget they have a flashlight on their head?",
            "RIP NCR. They were done dirty, HARD \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udee1 They were represented, at best, as a once thriving town, and not as a MASSIVE NATION.\n\nPersonally didn\u2019t mind the \u201cvault tec starting the war\u201d bit. It was executed well and made sense within the established lore IMO. \n\nThey seem to imply that Vault 31/32/33 maintained contact with the Enclave (who are somehow still alive) all this time, and that\u2019s how they nuked Shady Sands. But I feel like Enclave would\u2019ve used that nuke waaaay sooner, and the whole thing is just so\u2026random.\n\nMaybe I missed it, but they didn\u2019t explain how Maldaver stayed alive so long, why people worshipped her in Vault 4, or what exactly happened with Vault 32. Yea, they found out about Vault 31, but\u2026. Ok? Why kill each other? \n\nAnd who cleaned up Vault 32 in 24 hours after letting it sit for 2 years? And it didn\u2019t occur to Vault 31 overseer (the robobrain) to warn Hank about what happened?\n\nThe cold fusion thing was cool, and lays down the foundation for rapid revitalization of the west\u2026.except it\u2019s now in control of the BOS.",
            "So they mentioned the Enclave like once and then never brought it up again?",
            "I really don't want to be too negative, because this is better than I expected in a lot of ways, *but* boy did they do the NCR exactly as badly as I feared they would.",
            "It is so over NCR bros",
            "\u201cIf you want to see the fate of democracy, look out the window\u201d - House in NV \n\n\nJK LOL IT WAS ME AND MY VAULTTECH BUDDIES ALL ALONG :33333",
            "Honestly I think they meant to make 87, that time for getting nuked makes sense. It seems like that\u2019s the biggest error to be 100% honest and changing that fixes most of the confusion",
            "Why is the ghoul seemingly invincible?",
            "Even if we ignore the incosistencies with the timeline, nuking Shady Sands doesn't take the Boneyard with the Gun Runners industries, Vault City, New Reno, Dayglow, Baja out of the picture. Sure, there would be a vacuum of power but it doesn't explain how the ENTIRE NCR army is simply gone now.\n\n  \nI'm not mad the NCR is gone, I'm mad they made it in a way that makes zero sense with no further explanation. Also, did we get any info on why the Brotherhood is taking in aspirants in the East? Did they oficially join up with the West Coast BoS?",
            "The show both contradicted and supported New Vegas's canonicity. \n\nIn episode 6, the chalkboard says that Shady Sands fell in 2277 and implied that it was nuked during said Fall. Fallout New Vegas takes place in 2281.\n\nIn the Episode 8 post-credits scene, we see a crashed NCR vertibird, several securitrons, a busted open gate, and the New Vegas sign, implying that some sort of battle happened at New Vegas. Meaning the NCR did have some sort of conflict at New Vegas.",
            "Idk why but I\u2019m stoked to see Michael Emerson",
            "I really enjoyed the show, but like many, am just slightly disappointed at how they did the NCR. With the timeline inconsistency plus the fact even if Shady Sands was destroyed\u2026 the NCR was supposed to be basically a nation. Not dependent on ONE city. It\u2019d be a blow but not an immediately fatal one. 35,000ish people? Previous lore has placed NCR citizen levels at 700,000+ \ud83d\ude11\n\nI am reasonably confident however that this won\u2019t mean a retcon to the general events of New Vegas. It\u2019d be something that happened 15 years ago by now tho. I\u2019m just wondering if they will actually be willing to cast a Courier or if they\u2019ll just be a legend we hear about. \n\nAlso wondering which ending they will canonise. Not the NCR one that\u2019s for sure \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m guessing they might actually go with the Mr House ending. Just to be able to use that character as he can still be alive that way and MacLean has a connection with him Pre-War. It\u2019d also be kinda cool to see him arrive hoping to talk to Mr House and find our favourite Courier with his feet up in the Lucky 38 and House long dead \ud83d\ude02 \n\nMy definite guess would be either Mr House or Courier in charge. Cant be NCR with the state of California in Season 1. And I seriously doubt they\u2019d go with the Legion ending \ud83d\ude02\n\nAlso mildly dissatisfied that we didn\u2019t get a Deathclaw \ud83d\ude22 hadda tease us with the skull at the end\ud83d\ude02 I wonder if MacLean is gonna head through Quarry Junction to get into town \ud83d\udc40",
            "I love the NCR and I don\u2019t think they should\u2019ve been destroyed and I\u2019m pissed about it, but at least tie it into an Enclave return or some shit, not just fucking vault tek man\n\n\nEdit: after having a bit more time to think on the show, I\u2019m fine with how things were done, I was a bit hasty in complaining.",
            "There doing the fuckin find your dad plot again goddammit. I'm only on ep 1 by the way.",
            "Assuming that everything in this show is canon, Ulysses is an idiot. Like, for real.",
            "Was bored and had a burner number. Vault Tek number from Episode 6 wasn't a 555 number.\n\nCalled the number. Got a recording of someone screaming. Fits the show but no clue if Amazon owns that number or not.",
            "Can't they just go back and cgi out the 2277 date and change it to 2287 or something? I mean, Game of Thrones CGed out coffee cups, for cryin out loud.\n\nMaybe if enough ppl complain, they will.\n\nOr is it possible that whoever, in the show, wrote that on the board was misinformed and wrote the date down wrong? (I haven't actually watched yet, waiting to get off work.)",
            "I haven't finished it, I want to love it. The sets are great, it brings me into the setting and all.\n\n>But they did the NCR dirty and I honestly can't forgive them for it. It reeks to me of New Republic treatment. The West Coast didn't need a super power BoS..",
            "feels to me like a lot of people are just getting way too anal about certain dates and locations and stuff needing to line up. i like interconnected universes as much as the next guy, but its clear to me that these things should be viewed separately. continuity has never been a strong suit of bethesda, so im not surprised this show contradicts so much previous lore. but all this stuff about it ruining new vegas or making it non canon sounds so whiney to me. if you're someone who only liked fallout for 1, 2, and nv, well boy i have some news they all still exist and the events of this show have 0 impact on what happened in those games. all that said though, im disappointed to see california essentially getting a hard reset. my favorite part of fallout is not the post-apocalyptic frozen in time wasteland, but the post-post-apocalypse the prospect of rebuilding from the ashes. i hope that if they stay in california and if the show gets more than 2 seasons that they can do something to progress humanity. bethesda has now written almost 25 in game years of fallout lore, (not counting 76) but it still feels like the franchise is stuck in 2008 in many ways.",
            "Honestly, it would've made a lot more sense to set it in the Capital Wasteland, considering the Vault Tec HQ is there if I remember, not the west coast. And, it's Bethesda's stomping grounds anyway. \n\nAlso, instead of Shady Sands being nuked and having a big crater, Megaton could've actually worked a lot better. It would've been possible and a lot more reasonable for Hank to go into the wastes, and rig the bomb to blow (Assuming Lone Wanderer didn't disarm the bomb). Or, Megaton could've just been blown up by the player, canonizing a bad karma Lone Wanderer would've honestly been a fucking awesome choice.",
            "Apparently, tatos are pre war now, vault 33 has them",
            "NCR bros it\u2019s actually so over. The show was so good up until this point like actually. And then they have to do this. Why? Literally why?",
            "They destroyed the NCR is the dumbest way possible. Just some random ass nuke from fucking Vault tech? What???",
            "So, in summary, if I understand correctly, these are the major changes:  \n\\- Shady Sands got cratered in 2277  \n\\- NCR vertibird downed on the strip  \n\\- The Strip barricades are gone  \n\\- Vault Tec seemed to have caused the Great War  \n\\- The Boneyard is no longer a thing  \n\\- Shady Sands is in place of the Boneyard  \n\\- NCR Rangers are gone  \n\\- Aradesh is no longer the founder of Shady Sands (more speculatory)  \n\\- Somehow the Brotherhood seemed to have overran the NCR in 2277  \n\\- Destroyed Securitrons\n\nWhat I can't believe is that they actually retconned the original two Fallout games and that nobody won New Vegas. Even more egregious is the lore change with the BoS-NCR war, which retcons THE ENTIRETY OF F:NV. This has to be a new timeline at this point.",
            "Destroying Shady sands??? Really???? Todd Howard isn't helping the narrative that he hates obsidian and new vegas.",
            "Remember how we were saying it\u2019d be nice to have an update on the west during the content drought the past few years? Yeah, I think I take that back. Jfc",
            "The NCR apparently never made it to Vegas and Shady Sands was nuked 4 years before the start of it? Why would they do this lol",
            "How did Lucy\u2019s dad (the overseer) not recognize muldover when she showed up for Lucy\u2019s wedding. She announced her real name and everything",
            "Loved the show, a couple things i\u2019d likd to see in hopefully the next season:\n\n-Energy weapons in action - there were a couple of laser weapons shown but never fired, will be fun to see them in action\n\n-Another suit of power armor in action - would love to see either a suit of t50 or enclave armor being used\n\n-Super mutants and deathclaws - two iconic mutants havent shown up yet, i get the muties are a dying breed by this point, but they\u2019re still major to the series, and deathclaws are deathclaws\n\n-And finally some greater dive into what exactly is going on with the ncr and what happened with them in new vegas, i get some people are upset and confused with the shady sands destruction, but i cant help but think that date was deliberate to get the game fans asking questions. Nolan loves puzzle boxes and since people familiar with the games had an advantage in knowing much of the vault backstories, this was his way of creating intrigue for the people who are more ahead of things",
            "God, this is annoying. I\u2019m actually completely okay with the Vault-Tec starting the Great War theory and I\u2019m also completely okay with them being the ones who destroyed the NCR.\n\nIt\u2019s been a fan theory for a while that they started the war, and while it\u2019s not great, I can accept it. And I guess if they\u2019re going to be the ones to start the Great War, I\u2019m also fine with them destroying the NCR. It\u2019s a kind of cool parallel to have those who destroyed the pre-war world also destroy the biggest post-war civilisation?\n\nBut WHY did they have to destroy the NCR in 2277?? That one decision has completely ruined the idea for me. If they had done this after 2281, I would have bought it, it\u2019s not perfect but I would have just shrugged it off. \n\nAnd there\u2019s no way this is a mistake. These guys seem to have a pretty decent understanding of the timeline and lore, until that moment. And Todd is also a producer, im sure he of all people should know at least the year each game takes place in.",
            "The lore aspect is absolutely brutal\n\nThe show itself isn't bad; kind of fun to see Fallout stuff in live action.\n\nFeels like Bethesda is determined to destroy Fallout's origins and completely re-theme the entire series to American Corporations are evil and have nukes.\n\nThey also seem far to happy to keep the Fallout world in a constant state of destruction. It would of been far better had we actually got to see a true post-apocalypse city in Shady Sands",
            "Ok, I don't think nuking one city destroys an entire nation immediately. Shady Sands is not in the mojave, the NCR could easily have had people in the mojave during 2281, and they did make it to vegas because of the crashed vertibird at the end. also, i'm not sure what you guys are on, just because places like the boneyard, New Reno, etc aren't directly visited doesn't mean they flat out don't exist anymore \u2620\ufe0f",
            "Show is good but fuck Michael Rapaport\u00a0",
            "I really liked the pip boy screen too. In at least one distant shot, you can see the exact screen from the game, with stats and inventory tabs and everything",
            "I was trying to tell him that if he messes up he can find two parantheses or brackets with anything in between them to reset his tries. He didn't need it, though.\n\nEdited because instructions weren't clear, and a lot of people still don't know this.",
            "Made me laugh.",
            "Didn't they greenlight it before the show even aired?",
            "It was amazing, I'm really excited for what they'll do. I'm curious what they'll say happened to New Vegas, I don't think they'll remove the game from the canon, but House/The Courier/ Vault Tec had certainly something to do. SO EXCITEEED",
            "I'm glad I'm not the only one. It was amazing.",
            "The smile on my face when I saw the New Vegas skyline. Great season, I hope the 2nd is just as good.",
            "Halo got a season 2\u2026 if Fallout doesn\u2019t I say we riot.",
            "Was that the space needle looking building?  I can\u2019t seem to understand what that is.",
            "Most definitely to many cliff hangers and we going to New Vegas",
            "Dad sensed that his daughter had true Vault-Tec upper management potential.",
            "I knew I'd love her when she said okey dokey before sex \n\n\ud83e\udd2d",
            "That speech he gave her about how people are miserable and have to fight to survive is fucking rich from a guy who pretty much directly the reason they have to live like that.",
            "She also says something about a sticking a grenade in the head and blowing everyone up. But her \u201cdad didn\u2019t  raise her like that.\u201d \nI mean he technically didn\u2019t \u201craise her\u201d like that so maybe it\u2019s in her genes.",
            "A Liam Neeson, he is not.",
            "Yeah that line was a dead give-away for me that he was involved in Shady Sands.",
            "I felt that number was supposed to mean something. Very cool",
            "I really expected it to be a Revelation 22:13 reference right there",
            "Caught it right away. Beautiful homage to the day the world was introduced to Fallout",
            "Lol I thought Vault 101 and I knew Fallout 1 released in 97, I didn't consider a full date haha",
            "As soon as Hank had to give a code I knew it would be an easter egg. \nStraight away i thought \"was Fallout 1 released on the 10th of October 1997?\". Straight away googled it and yep.",
            "He's the inspiration for it, anyway.",
            "So basically the normal fallout player. Honestly kinda liked that she tried to bang everyone she had a chance with, like a true fallout player.",
            "Have you played Fallout Shelter? It's hard to keep track at some point. I just put one lucky son of a gun in a room and rotate between women in the vault. \n\nThat Fallout Shelter NPC had the best job in that shelter.",
            "You would too. Vaults are inherently gross.",
            "I think the implication was that she'd fooled around, not had actual sex \n\n\"Cousin stuff\"",
            "I think it was implied that they didn\u2019t actually fuck, but did everything else. She said something about being excited for the real thing.",
            "Welcome to Vault-Tec.",
            "I would definitely do cousin stuff with her",
            "Yeah, I appreciated them just leaning into it.",
            "Yeah, they really leaned into the nonsense science of the games. It works well.",
            "They also keep it as a very rare resource, so it works. Of course Vault 33 is stocked. But then they pretty much disappear. \n\nIn addition, for Lucy it seems to do just enough to stop her from dying and keep her moving. She still has to apply care after the attack is over.",
            "I like to think of it as being literally the same world as the game. Everything works the same way like Stimpaks and Radaway.",
            "I liked that too. Leaning into video game logic and some of the goofy science was the right way to do this I think.",
            "Yeah, legitimately never in my life had an \"OH MY GOD FOR REAL?\" moment but god damn they just put up the city like that and I was jumping in place like a little girl",
            "Hank is probably hoping to access the Lucky 38, and find Mr. House",
            "Na, same. Peoples are buthurt over nothings. The show is good, we can't be asking for more. Who care if they changed some dates or timeline, it's an adaptation.",
            "Welcome to the modern world. \n\nNothing is good enough nowadays",
            "Not remotely. I've played since F1, and I loved the show. I only had one nitpick, and it's a relatively minor pacing/foreshadowing issue in the first ep that has nothing to do with game canon. You are not alone.",
            "LOL, you weren't kidding!",
            "Lol my wife was not entertained when I told her this was the number for the dentist appointment I set up for her.",
            "Gonna call into a random support line, and when they ask for a good call back number incase we get disconnected. I\u2019m going to give them that number and hang up a minute later.",
            "Not just screaming, but wilhelm-level bloodcurdling screaming. Don't call it with your phone on speaker unless you want everyone to run into the room to see if you're OK.",
            "This was what I did the moment I saw the number. Cue my partner slowly looking up from her book and looking at me going 'what the hell?'; and I have to explain why a show based on a video game resulted in my phone having a call that was only screaming bloody murder. Worth it.",
            "The baby doll foot was perfection",
            "Yeah, I thought there were lots of small details that makes the show really good. Like that one frame of the dude wanking at the brother hood camp, makes it seem much more realistic, because It's a bunch of teenagers who have no idea what they are doing.",
            "My favorite bit is how Betty was also the receptionist who helped Coop in the room\u00a0",
            "Just so you know, I voted for Betty too",
            "reminded me of the thousand and one flashbacks of the empty swing and sad music in Naruto loool",
            "My opinion is he is emotional stuck in that moment. Personally I liked the repetitiveness of it",
            "Maybe they only had the kid actor for one day and he was like man Hollywood sucks, I'm out.\n\nOn the other hand they apparently filmed Lucy and her father for a solid month, just him in a cage saying \"don't do it\" or \"do it\" and her looking sad. What happened there, were they a full five minutes short on running time or what.",
            "Maximus might be a synth",
            "I\u2019m trying to figure out why people in Vault 32 died. Like, ok I get that your overseer from Vault 31 is a pre war evil corporate mastermind\u2026. But why would you all kill each other upon that revelation?",
            "wasn't that done more or less with the vault in capitol wasteland that had the super mutants? \n\nbut it was connected to a secret science lab.",
            "It was kinda a cult, a\" conspiracy cult\", in EP 6 she was the head of the Hollywood Forever \"conspiracy\" group, you can see the sign says chapel. So technically she kinda did. And as for the ritual part,\u00a0I think that's their own weird way of remembering the past, moldaver was their leader and probably got separated and took refuge in the vault after the nuke. Them missing their home and the ritual was to remember SS and Moldaver. I don't think the NCR is a cult, but the SS refugees under Moldaver leadership could've been.

Just a power vacuum, maybe disconnected sects of the NCR still exist in some form implied by the whole \"President of the Govermint\" scene. I could be wrong, but I feel like people are jumping onto the whole \"they killed off the whole NCR\" train too hastily. I personally think a lot of NCR story beats are being saved for future seasons, especially since both Lucy and Max are kinda sorta NCR citizens in a way.

Beyond that, all I've seen are people talking about Shady Sands being too close to LA. \n\nThe destruction of Shady Sands issue maybe has some merit. We don't know how old Lucy is, but her acctress is 27/28. If we assume the same for Lucy, she would have been 5/6 if Shady Sands was destroyed in 2277 and that looks to be her intentional age considering the actress playing young Lucy and the plot surrounding her not really knowing or remembering her time in Shady Sands. We can get around this issue by assuming Lucy as a character is younger (and I feel like she is intended to be, considering the conversation between her and Chet), so as long as she is younger than 24 there's plenty of room to fit the destruction of Shady Sands into the lore of New Vegas. \n\nI really enjoy my Fallout Lore, and I didn't notice anything Lore Breaking outside of these things. There are definitely additions to existing lore, like the Gulpers being on the West Coast at all, confirmation that Vault Tech was actively planning to initiate the war, Robert House being in on that conversation in 2077, or the pretty different Brotherhood we see, but nothing else that is a total break from existing knowledge.",

By the time we get two generations deep, the BoS is already into full D&D cosplay, with knights and paladins and scribes...but they're still somewhat reasonable, focused on the mission, and remember that they descend from an army unit (or at least John Maxson does - the rest, they're beginning to forget a little). A few more generations and we're basically at the militia stage with them - they may take their history lessons, but it's unimportant to them - they're more focused upon their trappings than upon their origins.

Maybe I'm getting my dates wrong, which is really possible tbh, but if I'm not, then that just wouldn't add up. As for why Vegas is in total disrepair in the ending? I have no fucking clue. Maybe it's just for cinematic effect, maybe it's because the state of Vegas in NV would be a little hard to explain in a show that partially caters itself to people who aren't familiar with the games, or maybe Dust is suddenly canon or some shit like that.

Create Cold Fusion Tech, patent it secretly, let your business competitors dump money into R&D on it, and when they finish making it just prevent them from actually using it based on your patent. \n\nI was also wondering about the 111/31 connection, as well as Vault 4 in California and Vault 96 in Appalachia, which also have Cryo Pods. My best guess is that Vault Tech knew the cryo pods worked, and 111 was an experiment primarily to see *how long* they could work before the frozen person died. The residents of 111 were never meant to be thawed out, which is why the Overseer never recieved the all clear that would authorize him to thawe everyone out. We don't have the records in game to say for sure, but I'm willing to bet his adamant stance against opening the Vault was from Vault-Tech and maybe the one empty pod was supposed to be his in the case of an emergency. \n\nSo with the cryo-pods, my thinking is their experiments/purpose was like so:\n\n4: Preserve the genetic research specimens for the Vault's experiments\n\n31: Freeze mid-high level Vault Tech Employees for varying amounts of time, unthawing them as necessary to insert them into the gene pools of Vaults 32 and 33 and to ensure control of those vaults long term. \n\n96: Same as 4, but instead of pregnant women, its mostly flora/fauna if I'm remembering it right\n\n111: Freeze average citizens indefinitely and determine exactly how long Cryo-Pods can preserve life on average",

I only mentioned it as a lore issue cause thats what most people complaining are pointing out. \n\nThe chalkboard does list \"the fall of Shady Sands\" or something to that effect as being 2277, but the explosion is clearly meant to be farther down the timeline. People are conflating those two things to say thats when it happened, but if anything, lore wise Shady Sands losing its status and stability in 2277 is pretty much in line with what we know of the NCR for the time. \n\nThat would have been the year of the First Battle of Hoover Dam, so the NCR had already started spreading thin and expanding into Nevada. We know that decision was made in part out of desperation because the NCR was beginning to struggle. All of this is lore from New Vegas directly. \n\nSo the whole argument that the chalkboard is breaking canon or that Bethesda hates New Vegas and destroyed the NCR because of that is ridiculous. Outside of the NCR ending for NV, the NCR was on track to splinter amd the events of the other three endings set that in stone. Even factoring in the NCR ending, we know the dangers of the Divide were starting to migrate to Nevada, so even if the NCR manages to create a strong foothold in the Mojave and reinvigorate itself through it, that would have been basically destroyed in a few years time. \n\nIf they want to blame someone for the NCR going down, blame the writers for NV because that was clearly their intention and Bethesda kept with it. Hell, if anything Bethesda is probably *saving* the NCR by having it still be a standing faction of some kind 15 years later and setting Season 2 up to be based in New Vegas (at least some).",

Lots of companies own eachother, and still operate largely separately when it comes to day to day operations.",

My country did a similar thing, albeit when we were under Russian control, when \u00c5bo, or Turku, ceased to be our capital and it moved to Helsinki, one we still have as our capital.\n\nStands to reason even in a post-war society like the NCR, they'd likely keep their leadership centralized, not having it in one spot like Shady Sands as they expand",
            ">So the whole argument that the chalkboard is breaking canon or that Bethesda hates New Vegas and destroyed the NCR because of that is ridiculous.\n\nYeah seems like crazy nitpicking by people since it isn't even confirmed maybe we will see a flashback to that date or just after it and the city hasn't been bombed yet to fix it.",

It's also insinuated that the Overseers orchestrate struggles to manipulate the population into believes the Vault 31 people are the better leaders. Vault 32 might've been going through one of those hard times and found out during it.",

            "Yeah vault tec mention they could drop the nukes but that doesn\u2019t mean they did. I seriously doubt Coops wife would allow the bombings to occur on a day when her husband and daughter were out and about either. \n\nI still think nuclear war between nations occurred personally.",
            "Yeah, honestly they were made for each other cause holy shit is maximus a idiot too, just in a slightly more innocent way",
            "Yea this is 100% it. Our first flashback of Coop was the end of his pre-war journey, an old actor who'd lost his on screen relevance and was relegated to doing birthday parties. Everything after is setting the lead up to that, we see his family and his life, we see him learn who his wife really is and what her goals are, and we see how those don't allign. She's clearly onto to *someone* listening in, and he will absolutely confront her about the truth of what's going on (we watched him confront her about lesser moral issues already, he won't stay silent).\n\nI don't think we're getting more pre-war flashbacks for Coop, though. I think they gave us everything we need to know now. His wife was a Vault Tech higher up, she was working to ensure she and their daughter could get into \"one of the good vaults,\" Coop doesn't agree with the corporatization of the vaults and the war itself and that puts a strain on their relationship, once Coop learns the true nature of what Vault Tech (and his wife) are doing their marriage ends, but when the bombs drop he knows the only place his daughter can be safe is in a Vault with her Mother. We don't need to actually see the confrontation or the divorce, his downfall as an actor into doing little parties, or anything else pre-war relating to Coop. \n\nHis story this season was setting up his story next season, partly through flashbacks and partly through interacting with Lucy (the primary protagonist). Next season will be his story with Lucy as his secondary and Maximus in a lesser role setting up the Third Season.",
            "Yeah they do ham that up with the branding scene as well, so it tracks",
            "Agreed, given that they talk about the crop harvest which failed in vault 32, which we later see as having been true with all the dead plants. It might be that the orchestrated struggle went out of hand for the sitting/upcomming overseer to such a point a revolt happened. After which they discovered what Norm also found on their computer.",
            "Most likely ex-husband at that point. Didn't someone mention that he was performing at birthday parties to pay for alimony?",
            "I would be kind of surprised if we don't see, or at least hear about him getting his daughter from the party to her mother/vault.\n\nSince he's looking for \"his family\", we know that he got her to safety, and since he referred to the two of them as a unit, he likely left them together.  \n\nThere's also the particulars of why he didn't end up in there with them. Yes they are divorced, but that's still her daughter's father. I'm curious whether she had any say as to why he didn't end up in a vault, if it was someone else's decision, or even his own. He's probably anti-vault enough to decide that it would be better to die than be locked in one. \n\nAnd did Vault Tech actually drop the bomb? I kind of doubt that she would be OK with that happening while her daughter was out there at a party with Coop.",
            "I think it's less that he lost his relevance and more that he was probably excommunicated by Hollywood for being a \"commie\" (speaking out against Vault-Tec)",
            "31 may have caused the crop harvest.",
            "I think you may be right, point stands about the daughter though",
            "Most of this, I could see them exploring. But I think I would rather that be done through interactions with Coop and Lucy than with flashbacks now that she's traveling with him. \n\nFor the last part, I'm not sure the implication is supposed to be that Vault Tech actually drops the bomb themselves. Just that Vault Tech is going to be putting in work to ensure the bombs actually do get dropped by China and the USA. They'll use their political and economic influence to ensure peace isn't an option and basically force one side to fire first, but they won't have exact control on when that happens. \n\nEven beyond just Barb wanting to control when to ensure her daughter's safety, Vault Tech was still actively spending money and working on vaults up to the Great War. If they had control over the exact day, I doubt they would have been signing people up in Sanctuary Hills or still working on the unfinished Vaults (114 and \"Fake 13\"). They would have either waited to finish those projects and ensure vaults were at full capacity, or they wouldn't have started the latter two at all while knowing the end was nigh.",
            "Yea that was what I was trying to get at, he lost his relevance by getting passed over for every gig he went for.",
            "They 100% did, I have no doubts. It was a manufactured incident because \"people love to have something to fuss about\""

Consider speed running, mods are always banned if they change the game, but glitches are vital in speed running, you don't see anyone advocating a teleport mod to move you through the door in Peaches castle instead of using BLJs, same result, but one is a part of the game. There are even some game devs that have kept glitches in games after they are discovered because the community uses them and wants them.",

Using in-game systems to exploit to your benefit are not the same thing as using literal cheats.\n\nThere's really not much distinction.\n\nIt's *not* the same as speedrunning. They make a clear distinction between glitched and glitchless runs.\n\n>There's also two other factors. One, it usually requires some level of out of the box thinking to do the exploits, so you're not completely throwing out the game experience to do it. \n\nHard disagree.
