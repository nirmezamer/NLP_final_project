(If this is false then rip my theory), but I'm pretty sure that the Sage refers to Vederfolnir, and the 4 pillars are the other sinners. They mention how they were trying to persuade the higher ups to stop them from continuing to poke around the secrets of the Heavens/Celestia.

            "HAPPY BIRTHDAY YOIMIYA!!!! \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn keeping with my (self administered) title of \"Sanest Yoimiya Main\", I wanna explain why she means so much to me\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost of my life is just me doing stuff without feeling anything. I don't mean to to say that I don't have moments of happiness or sadness, but more so that I don't find pleasure in the mere act of existing itself. I'm indifferent to the ebbs and flows of life.\n\nHappy-go-lucky characters are by definition characters whose natural state is enjoyment and happiness. As such, while I never disliked them per se, I never felt a connection to them either. That's why I didn't think much of Yoimiya when I first got her.\n\nHowever as time went on, I realized Yoimiya was different. Generally, other similar characters are always bubbly and super energetic. Yoimiya on the other hand not only understands but also appreciates the beauty of peace and silence. This is represented by the sudden calm moment in her ost, and also the reason she kept quiet during her sq1 cutscene. I believe it represents both reminiscence and introspection, taking out a moment to simply relive past memories to realize that you have it in you to get through whatever may be going on.\n\nOn a similar note, a lot of happy-go-lucky characters exist in this sort of 'happy zone', and try to drag other characters into it. At times, it comes off as annoying and 'toxically positive'. Yoimiya never seemed to fall into this either, and that's because she never tried to force someone to be happy, but always found the best in people and nudged them in the right direction. This was best exemplified in her sq2, where she didn't directly cheer Avin up or even talk to her, but did small things to make her day. Imo, these small nudges is what makes her happiness so infectious.\n\nAll this to say, Yoimiya breaks out of the stereotypical energetic and happy character who are always on the brink of being insufferable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn a completely different note, I'm extremely reclusive when I'm around strangers, but am very comfortable with friends. That means I'm very open to making friends, but terrible at doing so unless someone else initiates it. It's kinda like those memes about extroverts adopting the introverts. Yoimiya of course is extremely extroverted and extremely talkative. She is totally someone I could talk to for hours.\n\nNot only that, she really cares about the people she talks to. She is one of the handful of characters who actually ask the traveler about their sibling, and is basically the only character who is not completely dismissive of Paimon. She is also more than willing to help out people who she doesn't even know. And heck, her entire job in a way is to immortalize the hopes and dreams of people!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, where does this leave me. I have plenty of friends, but they're all somewhat like me. I wish someone like Yoimiya existed in my life, to push me to become a happier and better version of myself. Someone who forced my out of my comfort zone of doom and gloom, if for nothing but for her sake.\n\nAnd I wish I was like Yoimiya too. I wish I also had the ability to bring happiness to everyone around me. In a way, she is a far better version of me, a version I could never realistically achieve.\n\nShe is both someone I wish I had in my life, and someone I wish I could one day become\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, this is why I love Yoimiya\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>!...or maybe I'm just overly attached to my first 5\\* and went on a schizo rant to justify it!<",

You could be cynical and say it's just a feel-good story, but they did have some very beautiful things to say about appreciating the beauty in life even when it's painful.

Of course, the combat one is the biggest and the most sacred event they have.!<\n\n>!When we arrived in Natlan, they are already holding their yearly competetion in exchange of an audience with Murata.

So Capitano, the strongest of the Harbingers had decided to join the competition himself. Of course upon knowing this, the Traveler had decided to join as well in hopes of asking Murata the questions.!<\n\n>!Iansan was another competitor from a disadvantaged tribe and wanted to gain an audience with Murata to help her people. Alongside her there are different playable characters that will join the competition.!<\n\n>!In the first round, the Traveler had an easy time winning against their opponents. The spectators people whispered amonst one another and recalled the rumors about our adventures for the past years. On the same vein, people are also talking about Capitano and how he defeated a crowd favorite easily. Meanwhile, Iansan just stand on the background and felt intimidated by the power of the Traveler and Capitano. That's the end of the act one.!<\n\n>!Act two was split with spending time with other characters and watching them advance. Basically, we follow Iansan to her tribe and find out about her situation. At first, Traveler and Paimon felt pity on her but after talking with the elder, they promised her that they will give their best in the upcoming fight as that is what everyone would have wanted.!<\n\n>!Act three is more competition and some backstory. It's full of fight cutscenes and the devs implemented boss fights for other playable characters like HSR. We get to fight Iansan and two other characters in this act. After the AQ you can challenge them again in a special arena. Capitano also beats his opponents here easily to the point that the Traveler felt intimidated. At this point, both of them are the finalists.!<\n\n>!The next arc starts with Murata inviting the champions as well as the contestants in a gathering. However, the traveler did not expect that it will take in a communial hotsprings. All of the Natlan characters will appear there as well as Murata and Capitano (Without his helmet). However due to the rating ot the game, we can only see their shoulders and head. Murata will invite the Traveler (who now joined the bath) and Capitano in a secluded area to talk. Paimon is left behind.!<\n\n>!Here we'll know the story of Capitano. Once, his people were also servant of the gods however, after years of oppression, they decided enough is enough and started a revolution. Naturally, the gods were powerful but centuries of research has allowed their civilization to cultivate god killers who can stand toe to toe with gods. Capitano is one such man. He used to be a thin and sickly man however his will power got the attention of a scientist that helped him grow to become stronger. He started as a private but years of war had earned him fame. He told how he used to pull a sword out of the stone god. He told how he convinced the titans of his world to rebel against the gods and used them to climb their pantheon in the sky. In the end, he's the only survivor of his people. Lost, he traveled from world to world becoming a hero till he arrived in Teyvat to wage war against the gods again. Finally, Murata asked for his real name and Capitano Answered!<\n\n>!Himmel Rogers, Great King, the Imperishable, GOAT, The Great King of Humanity, King of Kings, Opener of the Way, Wielder of the Divine Sword, Punisher of Gods, The Great Unifier, Commander of the Immortal Legion, Sacred of Appearance, Bringer of Light, Father of Heroes, Builder of Civilization, Protector of the 10,000 Worlds, Keeper of Life, Chosen of Tsarista, Grand Steward of the Horizon, Sailor of the Great Sea of Worlds, Sentinel of the Nine Realms, The Undisputed, Begetter of the Begotten, Scourge of the Faithful, Carrion-feeder, First of the Lost Valley, Rider of the Steed Vanquisher of Immortals, Champion of the Death Arena, Mighty Lion of the Infinite Space, Emperor of Humanity, He Who Holds The Blade Great Bane Of The Heavens, Arch-lord of Atlantis, Waker of the Titans, Ursurper of the Sky, Majestic Emperor of the Humanity, Champion of Humanity, Breaker of the Angelic Clans, Builder of the Great Fortress, Terror of the Holy, Master of the Never-Ending Horizon, Master of the People, Taker of Gods, Tyrant to the Heaven and Hell, Bearer of the Unholy Blade, Soldier of Us, Soldier of Nobody, The Great, Chaser of Dreams, Keeper of the Royal Throne, Founder of the Longinus Cult, Banisher of the House of God, High Lord Admiral of the Faithless, Guardian of the Hellfire Pass, Tamer of the Dragon God King, Everliving Ursurper Lord, Dismisser of the Warrior Goddess, Executioner of the Gods,!< **He Who Does Not Serve**, >!Slayer of Megathreadas, Chaos God Purger, Favoured of Tsarista, Trump Card of the Great Game, Liberator of Life, Lord Slayer, Wrangler of Leviathan, Emperor of the Plains, Eternal Bane of Khaenri'ah Legions, Seneschal of the Great Empire, Curserer of the Divine, Regent of the Norhtern Mountains, Warden of the Eternal Paradise, Harbinger of all Harbingers, Caller of the Wrathful Wind, God-Slayer, Master of the River Styx, Liberator of the Dead, Forgotten Keeper of the Obelisks, Deacon of the Sanzu River, Belated of Wakers, General of the Mighty Frame, Summoner of Blight, Master of all Marial Arts, Prince of Dust, Tyrant of Celestia, Purger of the Flame Breathers, Killer of the True God's Champions, Sultan of the Gold Dunes, Dark Flame Lord, Avenger of the Dead, Carrion Master, Eternal Warden of Humanity, Breaker of Divine Bonds... and many, many more...!<\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/user/me/)",

            "*\"Now that my magic is spent,*\n\n*Please, O judge, lift the chains from my soul!*\n\n*Never again consign me to dance alone upon this lonely isle.*\n\n*My last glimmer of hope I offer up to you.\"*\n\nThe 4.2 description hurts me on so many levels.\n\nIt's structured as a prayer from Furina and/or Focalors towards Neuvillette, and somewhat changes meaning depending on who's perspective it is\n\nThe first line is a callback to The Final Feast and 4.0 - everyone was \"enjoying the show\" while not noticing \"that what was intentionally hidden\" for the magic to work. The magic being spent can mean both Furina breaking at her trial for being discovered to truly be a human after 500 years of a perfect facade of a god, while Focalors' directly means her time is nigh and it's time for \"the show\" to end so that \"the audience\" - the people of Fontaine - would be free.\n\nThen there's the two next parts of the \"prayer\" - aside from the highs and lows of humanity, the only constancy in their lives was each other, yet even then they all were supposed to preform in their own solo acts, loneliness gripping them all. From Focalors' perspective this is the end of her loneliness in the Oratrice - alas, at the cost of her existence - for her people and her body & soul to live on. From Furina's this is a request both to one of the only living beings close to her, yet also a general plea to the world - to finally be free and be rid of those days of crippling loneliness, desperately hoping to save everyone.\n\nAnd finally - \"My last glimmer of hope I offer up to you.\" Regardless of the perspective, it's fairly self explanatory - they've done all they can as hopeful as they can, now it's his turn for the \"final act\", the finishing touch - to save everyone.\n\n...and then there's Neuvillette's \"perspective\". Though he's certainly the reincarnation of the Hydro Dragon, the original God of Life, divine as that may seem - Neuvillette is still part human. Much like Furina, he felt joy, sorrow and everything inbetween. He spent these hundreds of years growing closer to those whom he resembles, learning about them and trying to understand himself... And inevitably it led him to understand more and finish the final act of the show, yet he also was inevitably broken - in the end, he's simply a man with a big, kind and confused heart, having to fullfil the great wish of the people, of the god and her humanity who fought their hardest to save those people, who had inevitably ended up helping him by sending him on this journey as well, along with the weight of one of them being denied the gift of true life, and both suffering greatly...\n\nAnd in the end, all the people would have witnessed is the immense downpour that day.\n\n>!Posting this again in this megathread cause I'm really proud of it!<",

            "Genshin dream\n\n>!I've dreamed about Genshin again, this time the Navia gacha was available, and I was pulling on her character gacha while I was in a Fontaine area that doesn't exist IRL, it was a place that *looked* like it was Fontaine but it also gave me the feeling that it was Liyue?!<\n\n>!Anyway, I was using some Claymore character to explore before I started pulling (I don't know who this character is), and in the dream I had the thought that \"I am going to pull for Navia's weapon first because it works on this character that I'm using right now anyway\" (don't ask me what the hell is up with that). So I pulled for her weapon, and it actually came pretty quickly. The gacha UI was also slightly different, that 10-pull UI when it shows each item side by side I mean, I could only *slightly* see that it was Navia's weapon until I inspected the item.!<\n\n>!Now that I had her weapon, I wanted her character for sure (again, what is up with that? Just pull Navia first instead of the weapon, dream me.... almost as if I was trapping myself there). I started pulling, and it was bad, I had to go to high pity, and before I did my last pulls, I looked at how many more I had.!<\n\n>!I looked at the in-game shop thing that shows the exact amount you have if you click to \"convert\" but don't actually convert. And it was... like... *eight left*... I got pretty sad at this point, thinking I'd have to wait for her rerun again, not being able to do Clorinde X Navia things, any Taylor Swift references, stare at her idles, and what have you.!<\n\n>!So I started doing single pulls, and before my first one, I spoke out loud something along the lines of \"Please give me Navia, or I'll have to wait for so long...\", and then she actually came?! But it was weird! Her outfit, it was completely different from IRL! She had this highly yellow outfit, the black and white parts were pretty much gone, almost as if she was wearing a tightsuit...? And when this happened, it was both \"normal\" and \"not normal\" to me, but this is why I realized it was a dream, and I suddenly woke out of it because of that, because of her outfit in the gacha art (her pose was still the same but the image was mirrored, her body was pointed to the right side instead of left like it is IRL).!<\n\n>!As for real life, I do want to pull Navia, not really her weapon (we'll see). And I have 200+ pulls saved right now... this dream just wanted to show me the first part, but without all those pulls in it for some reason, lol. I also have other theories as to why the rest of the dream worked the way it did, but it's getting too long now so I'll just stop.!<",

Please refer to the following descriptions instead.\n\nPassive Talent 1 - Lingering Fragrance\n\nEach time it collects 2 Scents, the Level 2 Lumidouce Case will consume Scents and release Cleardew Cologne that deals AoE Dendro DMG equal to 600% of Emilie's ATK to opponents. This DMG is not considered Elemental Skill DMG.\n\nPassive Talent 2 - Rectification\n\nEmilie deals increased DMG to Burning opponents based on her ATK, with every 1,000 ATK increasing DMG dealt by 15%. The maximum DMG bonus that can be gained this way is 36%.\n\nConstellation 1\n\nIncreases the DMG dealt by Fragrance Extraction and her Passive Talent's Cleardew Cologne \"Lingering Fragrance\" by 20%. The latter requires unlocking said Passive Talent first.\nAdditionally, when nearby party members trigger the Burning reaction on opponents or deal Dendro DMG to Burning opponents, they will generate an additional Scent. This effect can be triggered once every 2.9s.\n\nConstellation 2\n\nWhen Fragrance Extraction, Aromatic Explication, or Cleardew Cologne produced by the Passive Talent \"Lingering Fragrance\" (the last of which requires Passive Talent activation) hits opponents, those opponents' Dendro RES is decreased by 30% for 10s.\n\nConstellation 6\n\nWhen using Fragrance Extraction or Aromatic Explication, Emilie will gain Abiding Fragrance for 5s.\nWhile this is active, after Emilie uses Normal or Charged Attacks, she will generate 1 Scent, and her Normal and Charged Attack DMG will be converted into Dendro DMG that cannot be overridden, and the DMG dealt will be increased by 300% of Emilie's ATK.\nThe Abiding Fragrance effect will be removed after 4 Scents are created this way or after its duration expires. Abiding Fragrance can be triggered once every 12s.\n\nThank you.\n\n(those are just localization issue which is already reflected in CHS)",

He has pointy ears like Klee, Neuvilette (less pointy), Nahida and presumably Alice. Alice herself said that she and Klee are of a \u201clong life species\u201d, which probably means they\u2019re not human and the only other characters with pointy ears aren\u2019t human either. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know much about the Marionette, but I doubt she\u2019s a human either. Some people even think \u201cshe\u201d is an \u201cit\u201d and that they\u2019re both puppets.",

            "I didn\u2019t know that, and if your point was a rebuttal to my argument, it is a fair one indeed. \n\nHowever, it is worth to mention that Layla\u2019s race has never been confirmed, and even if she is a human, comparatively, units with pointy ears are often non-human opposed to. And my last point, Pulcinella doesn\u2019t even slightly resemble a human entity, but he\u2019s also a harbinger and the majority of them aren\u2019t humans, which checks out considering their individual power levels. \n\nOn the contrary, if your comment was an add-on to mine, thank you for that additional information.\ud83e\udd70",

            "The funniest part of this comment is that its completely valid. Really, let's look at Traveler's big \"accomplishments\" in the main story.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nDvalin: Buffed by Barbados, had the help of Diluc & Jean, and didn't actually defeat Dvalin. Traveler only removed the Abyss thorns on his neck. Dvalin was perfectly fine after the fight. Traveler and friends would have fallen to their deaths without Dvalin's help after the fight.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTartaglia: Inconclusive. Traveler only managed to survive until the FL ran out. Childe then unleashed Osial and left. If Traveler outright beat Childe, then Childe wouldn't have managed to summon Osial or escape.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOsial: That was not Osial, but rather the remnants of his power/malice. Also all of Liyue contributed to holding him off. Traveler just dealt with fodder enemies in that battle and had to get saved by Xiao at one point.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSignora: Text book case of Plot Armor. I'm no fan of Signora, but this fight was too much of a stretch. Traveler soloing the 8th harbinger without breaking a sweat while only using Dull Blade? No one can justify that with a straight face. I get that Traveler is getting stronger but literally at the end of the Liyue chapter, Paimon stops Traveler from confronting Singora, saying Traveler was no match for her. How does gaining one more element flip things?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nRaiden: Yae trained Traveler to specifically counter the Shogun's best moves. Plus Traveler got Buffed by 100 visions... whatever that means\u00a0\n\n\nScaramouche: The whole fight was Nahida's time loop illusions at work. Traveler didn't contribute much there.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nNarwhal: Childe and Neuvillete carried this one.\u00a0\n\n\nI can't imagine Traveler fighting Capitano on even footing, even after recovering 6/7 of their power. But at the very least, hoyo should give them a training arc in Natlan. Possibly one that ends in Traveler forging a new weapon for themselves to use canonically instead of Dull Blade. Would also mean we get a free 5* sword, albeit one tailored for Travler.\u00a0",
            "Agree!!! The Traveler has five elements at their disposal, yet they chose to fight Arle with a dull blade. Bruuuuuuh, character development ain't charactering.\n\nThey used Geo to deflect a rock avalanche back in Navia's story quest, yet for the fight in Arle's story, they used none. They be fightin' with a physical build. Urghh I'm so sick of Hoyo shittin' on the traveller; my main deserves more huhuhu",
            "Bro, your comment is too funny. \ud83d\ude2d",

            "Nah I will definitely miss Fontaine. I'm trying not to complete whatever quests I have left because once I have no reason to return there I'll feel sad lol. It's my favorite region in the game.",
            "The only place I really miss is Inazuma. It eas launching when I started playing and I will never ever forget the moment Raiden first appeared. She was MENACING. The perfect character. The only downside of inazuma was being divided into many islands. But everything else was pure gold. About Fontaine, I hope I\u2019ll never have to dive ever again",
            "I was happy to leave sumeru. The deserts put a really bad taste in my mouth that spoiled the region for me. Nearly quit genshin because the deserts. So don't speak about Sumeru like you knew peoples taste.",
            "Personally I didn't like the story but I think furina carried it and that was a nice outcome for me considering I have no interest in other characters sure I pulled for characters like arlecchino and Clorinde and they were nice but I wouldn't be sad if I missed them. I can't imagine playing the rest of Fontaine without furina",

Since I decided to do all the prison missions at the same time because it would be a \"smart and fun idea\".\n\nThere was a moment I really wished for Neuvillete to not stop the primordial water for taking that place.",

            "Arlecchino was in the middle of the video, the teaser ended with Neuvillette and Furina.",

            "what will you do with the info? did you save it? are you gonna take vacation on 5.2 launch right now?",
            "> and didn't actually defeat Dvalin. Traveler only removed the Abyss thorns on his neck. Dvalin was perfectly fine after the fight.\n\nFunny anecdotal comparison: I was trying to get a tangle out of my cat's tail earlier and the little shit was refusing to let me, even after I pinned him down. If the goal was simply to remove the tangle by any means necessary, it would've been easier to crush him to death or something.\n\nDvalin being fine after is a sign that the team (not necessarily just Traveler) was physically, dexterously, and morally strong enough to deal with the full might of Abyss Dvalin, fix the problem, while sparing Dvalin of their full might.",
            "corrections:\nTartaglia: Traveler held their own against Delusion form Tartaglia until he started pressuring after which Traveler used Anemo AND Geo powers, causing Tartaglia to become frustrated and go into overdrive with Foul Legacy to quickly finish, Traveler still held their own.\n\nOsial: Yes groups of mobs but still mobs that the Millelith had issues with defeating, Adepti channeled their power into the Traveler.\n\nSignora: You forget that Signora is not really a fighter, she just has powerful magic at her disposal, as well as a LOT of diplomatic influence which is why she is Rank 8 (Harbinger rank is a combination of combat power and other sources of power like wealth or political influence). Also Traveler had the training with Yae Miko beforehand so using some of the strategies of that is not unlikely.\n\nRaiden: same as Osial, got the power of 100 ambitions channeled into them.\n\nScaramouche: WRONG. Nahida's cycles and the people of Sumeru through the Akasha just gave the Traveler the PLAN on how to defeat him. Traveler still had to physically disable the mech on their own AFTER obtaining the information through the simulations. Nahida then just took the Gnosis.\n\nNarwhal: Again, Neuvillette only seperated the Narwhal from the Primordial Seawater in his body. The actual beating up and weakening inside was done by the Traveler in the fight, with Childe softening it up the two months beforehand. Then Neuvillette tried finishing it off but was interrupted by Skirk.\n\nThe Traveler is a GOOD swordfighter, far above average, but their real power is their ability to act as a conduit to channel the ambitions, hopes or powers of others into their own. This is further alluded to in the Narzissenkreuz questline finale where a Descender is someone with a will comparable or stronger than that of an entire world. The Traveler is a Descender, capable of collecting the wills of people around them to give themselves more power as seen against Osial and Raiden Ei. Against Arlecchino the three siblings didn't have much to pull from yet the Traveler could still hold out and break free to the point Arlecchino was quite satisfied and used her domain expansion and powers to *physically* immobilize them (they have these weird threads running over them), then dealt a complete mental shock to them and won. \n\nI do 100% agree that we need a training arc, I personally REALLY hope that Capitano will be the one to train us because we know he is quite noble.",

We have the gods of science, the gods of traffic laws \u2014 everything is covered in gods.

The reptilian counterparts in this game would be the vishaps, the abyss people (As they can shapeshift) and the Khaenrians, who are all not only connected to each other but they all originate from underground, just like how the reptilians supposedly originate from there too. This means the Sinners are Satan and his court of other elite demons that are often mentioned together with him like Beelzebub, Baphomet, etc.\n\n\nWhile here in Hinduism, right before we entered the Kaliyuga, we had alot of strong humans, including ones that were actually nearing the Gods in terms of power. There was also a man who gained so much power by meditating that he was able to create an entire universe. Even though he lost all his powers, It's still a massive feat of strength\n\n\nWe know that the devs like telling us the truth through media in a way they can \"ease it into us\" and Genshin ain't no different. Whatever the case is, we know there's alot of truth about the world hidden in plain site in any kinda entertainment media that we need to figure out for ourselves.

            "Makoto and Ei are incarnation of thunder, yeah istaroth helped Makoto, but she did not \"create her\", we know 100% that they are elemental creatures in the end, it's just how they came into being that's still a 50/50 some were born like this and some were created.",
            "The Fontaine wind glider text goes out of its way to clarify that although Egeria was created by an outsider to Teyvat, she was created only using \"original matter from this world, entirely without outside elements.\" Although she's the outlier so far when it comes to the origins of the Archons. None of the others have such detailed descriptions on how they were created.",
            "That's also true, can't argue with that.",
            "Yes! in fact the entire story has been hidden in the lore books since the very day the game released. Pretty insane. It's the battle pass story!\n\n**Venti:**\u00a0Once, there was a glorious kingdom established among the heavens.  \n**Venti:**\u00a0From that kingdom came a crowned heir, tasked with seeking out the Genesis Pearl from the Kingdom of Darkness.  \n**Venti:**\u00a0The first crowned heir began her journey of seeking the pearl.  \n**Venti:**\u00a0But she was deceived, and the memory of her noble origins faded.  \n**Venti:**\u00a0She now believed that she was the queen of the Kingdom of Darkness.  \n**Venti:**\u00a0But take heart, a second crowned heir had already taken up the path where the first had stumbled.  \n**Venti:**\u00a0This is the story of your journey, of your tale to be told.\n\nI will leave others to uncovering who the crowned heirs are. One is you, the player, but...also not who you think. The other is your brother \u2014 not your sibling, but your brother.",
            "thank you and no problem!",
            "Kinda not considering the Ysaritsa has yet to cause harm to people. She just has the Fatui doing things for their cause. but the Fatui aren't going around killing people and rasing homes. Even the Liyue incident only happened because Zhongli made a deal with Signora and he would've fixed it if things actually got bad.",
            "Wasn't it the Primordial one who defeated the Sovereigns? We don't even know what current Celestia is atm.",
            "Thats nice to know, thanks.",
            "because it is a vile resource that turns even the most respectable artifact into complete flat DEF roll",
            "My assumption is that the archons who bestow the visions are not aware themselves about the true nature of their \"gifts\" they give those with such ambitions.\n\nAlso, that is something I'm confused about. Do the archons give the visions themselves, and is it only them that give the visions, every time? I've only completed the main archon quest line, so the only vision I've actually seen with my eyeballs get bestowed is Wanderer's. I thought it was implied that his will simply manifested it, like it was a threshold \"trigger\" of will that caused it to appear. Or was it supposed to be that Buer was the one who personally bestowed it upon him?",
            "Pretty sure Ei already cut ties with Celestia and just want to save Inazuma so if vision is really being a cage then she want to remove it but problem is some people of Inazuma are dependent on the vision which cause harm on them and which cause the Resistance..And Traveler shows Ei the power of human ambitions and just decided to believe in it and abolish the VHD..",
            "I know I\u2019m just using an example that even shades like get involved and help them in certain cases even if it goes against heavenly principles.",
            "First of all, it is quite obvious that the Battle Past Story is 100% also referencing The Traveler and their Sibling. \n\nThis isn't one you are referencing though and I think you are referring to the fact that >!we the player are actually a character in Genshin which I believe was done in HI3 as well. I can't tell who the brother you are referring to is as of now though I have some ideas of it being a descender...!<\n\nAlso, I do believe the Gnostic Hymn also applies to the Heavenly Principles.",
            "ye the primordial one deafeted the sovereigns and claimed teyvat",
            "According to Neuvillette\u2019s profile, Archons set aside a portion of their divine power to be used for Visions. Ei\u2019s profile implies that Archons can subconsciously stop doing this.\n\nSo it\u2019s not so much a conscious act as it is the Archons powering an automated system.",
            "The topic wasn't about shades helping and what not but their origins, so to the person above (and me prior to reading this), it looked like a claim that the god of time made them."
