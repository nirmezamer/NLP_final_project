        "content": "It's that time of year again!\n\nDespite the several automated and signposted notices and warnings on this issue, it is a constant source of headaches for the mod team. Particularly considering our massive growth this past year, we thought it was about time for another reminder about everyone's favorite part of posting on /r/worldbuilding..... *Context*\n\n\n-----\n\n*Context* is a requirement for almost all non-prompt posts on r/worldbuilding, so it's an important thing to understand... But what is it?\n\n**What is context?**\n\n*Context* is information that explains what your post is about, **and** how it fits into the rest of your/a worldbuilding project.\n\nIf your post is about a creature in your world, for example, that might mean telling us about the environment in which it lives, and how it overcomes its challenges. That might mean telling us about how it's been domesticated and what the creature is used for, along with how it fits into the society of the people who use it. That might mean telling us about other creatures or plants that it eats, and why that matters. All of these things give us some information about the creature **and** how it fits into your world. \n\nYour post may be about a creature, but it may be about a character, a location, an event, an object, or any number of other things. Regardless of what it's about, the basic requirement for context is the same:\n\n- Tell us about it\n- Tell us something that explains its place within your world.\n\nIn general, telling us the **Who**, **What**, **When**, **Why**, and **How** of the subject of your post is a good way to meet our requirements.\n\nThat said... Think about what you're posting and if you're actually doing these things. Telling us that Jerry killed Fred a century ago doesn't do these things, it gives us two proper nouns, a verb, and an arbitrary length of time. Telling us *who* Jerry and Fred actually are, *why* one killed the other, *how* it was done and *why* that matters (if it does), and the consequences of that action on the world almost certainly does meet these requirements.\n\nFor something like a resource, context is still a requirement and the basic idea remains the same; Tell us what we're looking at and how it's relevant to worldbuilding. \"I found this inspirational\", is not adequate context, but, \"This article talks about the history of several real-world religions, and I think that some events in their past are interesting examples of how fictional belief systems could develop, too.\" probably is.\n\nIf you're still unsure, feel free to send us a modmail about it. Send us a copy of what you'd like to post, and we can let you know if it's okay, or why it's not.\n\n\n**Why is Context Required?**\n\nContext is required for several reasons, both for your sake and ours.\n\n- Context provides some basic information to an audience, so they can understand what you're talking about and how it fits into your world. As a result, if your post interests them they can ask substantive questions instead of having to ask about basic concepts first.\n\n- If you have a question or would like input, context gives people enough information to understand your goals and vision for your world (or at least an element of it), and provide more useful feedback. \n\n- On our end, a major purpose is to establish that your post is on-topic. A picture that you've created might be very nice, but unless you can tell us what it is and how it fits into your world, it's just a picture. A character could be very important to your world, but if all you give us is their name and favourite foods then you're not giving us your worldbuilding, you're giving us your character.\n\nGenerally, we allow **15 minutes** for context to be added to a post on r/worldbuilding so you may want to write it up beforehand. In some cases-- Primarily for newer users-- We may offer reminders and additional time, but this is typically a one-time thing.\n\n-----\n\nAs always, if you've got any sort of questions or comments, feel free to leave them here!",

            "What about youtube videos or blog posts?  Every so often, someone posts a video and never make a context post.  Do you consider the video as providing the context (like the infograph that self contextualize itself example on the resource tab) or does someone posting a video/external link still need a context post?  Does being an external link have any consideration on context?",

I feel like every other post that pops up on my feed from this community is someone asking \"Is it ok if I take inspiration from real life\" or \"can I write elves as a subterranean species\" or some other thing that isn't really a \"does this work\" question, just people asking for permission to create their own world.",
            "I think context is definitely required for the kind of content posted here, like it's nice to see nice art of some fantasy map or a spec-evo animal but having that little bit of explanation as to what it is you're looking at helps people conceptualize it more and allows them to better ask questions about it. Like that's a real issue when I see people post AMA's about their worlds on non worldbuilding focused subs I go on, they'll just say \"AMA about my fantasy world\" with zero explanation so we kind of have to parse out the context with our questions with is tedious and annoying.",
            "I can see the importance of context, but now I'm imagining someone new to worldbuilding just getting started and showing his starting point, but now needs to provide context by explaining how it fits into his greater world that doesn't exist to fit things in yet. So I feel like someone would have to already have a somewhat built world before getting started here(unless it's a prompt).",
            "My post was taken down, but I felt as though It did meet all the requirements. How can I appeal?",
            " Otherwise, know that context does help facilitate better conversations on this subreddit, so please make sure to include it when you make non-prompt posts. Thanks again! :)\n\nContext is a really critical part of worldbuilding and can make all the difference in the level of feedback you get from the community. Making sure to provide enough of the Who, What, When, Why, and How of a post is essential if you're looking for meaningful conversations to arise from it. Plus, context can help make sure that your post is actually related to worldbuilding and on-topic for this subreddit. If you ever have any questions, don't hesitate to send us a modmail!",

The post was up for about 20 minutes and then was taken down. Got a message from \"monswine\" that they took the post down, but since the post is gone, I can't read the message that I assume told why it was taken down. Awesome.",

            "Depends:\n\nIf it's a resource, like a video on, say, medieval cuisine or ancient Near Eastern religions, a good title can often provide sufficient context.\n\nIf it's a lore video, then we expect the context to be posted here on Reddit as well.",

The rules are some of the most extensive I've seen in a sub, yet many of them are either realistically unenforceable or (like this one) simply down to a whim. And it's not like the place is overflowing with high-quality content.\n\nAlas, none of my worlds I'm working on are fantasy.",
            "Seeing as I get flagged by the same mod who never has anything constructive to add, I limit myself to commenting, but haven't posted anything in a while.  I was just about to create a new post when I saw this sticky post and decided to read it.",
            "It's good to see that ask-me-anythings are allowed on r/worldbuilding, as they can be a great way to engage with the community.

Additionally, be sure to avoid using any copyrighted material when promoting your AMA with images.",
            "I wouldn't classify my project as fantasy and I still post there as its full of the same people who post stuff here. Also their discord is very nice, I use it much more than I use this subs discord. \n\nI remember someone saying that they were tired of the heavy handed yet often incompetent moderation of this sub and at the time I thought it was a bit harsh, but after some time i've come to understand this position. \n\nI created my own sub for my project and wrote an entire post linking to lore, history, cultures, maps and other materials that I would consider more than adequate to fulfil rule 2, even sent it to the mods here and they said it was fine. I post here and link to the page and get the notification saying my post was removed, and thus another strike was put on my account. \n\nThat was my \"fuck this shit im done\" moment.",
            "Yeah I\u2019ve had posts removed without warning, and other times a mod pops in to ask for clarification or extended details. This is for the same offense \u2014 so there\u2019s no consistency.\n\nThe _official guidance_ for how to provide context for posts bemoans that it is necessary because of how much mod time it takes up \u2014 and then goes on to recommend that if you\u2019re not sure, you should message the mods with the content before you post it to see what they have to say! It\u2019s just laughable.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s a waste of time, especially when half the time meaningful engagement is all but absent in a sub that supposedly has 1.3 million members!\n\nAnyway thanks for the recommend, I\u2019ll definitely check it out."

In the past, when the Er\u00e8me was residual and we still had continents and oceans, control of the skies was a key element of global geopolitics. Nowadays, it is no less than a matter of survival.\u00a0\n\nThe reign of lighter-than-air airships has been long and fruitful, from the early jazz era to the late disco age. Alas, much like the caudillo of Sambre or the late 50s disco craze, they were killed by the ever-growing Er\u00e8me -- they were too slow, too expensive, too limited in range. Yet, the world marched on. For the first time in history, we are capable of fielding large heavier-than-air vehicles, powered by the splitting of the atom. We have lost the eerie beauty of dirigibles, replaced by the cold elegance of flying wings riding jet-streams and collapsed Er\u00e8me hurricanes. Jet fighters and cruise missiles reign supreme in long-range engagements over icy clouds. High in the skies fly capital wings \u2014 massive flying wings capable of remaining in the air for weeks on end, linking the fractured remains of what could once be called humankind.\u00a0\n\nYou stand in a cockpit the size of a naval bridge. The wingspan of your aircraft nears three hundred meters, it weighs five thousand tonnes and carries twenty-two fighters and four hundred crewpeople. Its megawatt-scale nuclear reactor allows it to remain aloft for forty days straight, enough to circle the Er\u00e8me a hundred times. You stand watch at thirty thousand feet alongside the Babel-Internationale demilitarized zone, sixteen nuclear cruise missiles at your fingertips. You are a herald of the last age. \n\nRemember, commander. Upon your wings now rests the world. \n\n*Art commissioned to* [Fisher Art](https://twitter.com/FisherArt_)*.*",

For example, more strict areas in recent Islamic culture are very modest to the point where in some places, (women cover their whole bodies aside from eyes)[https://vigile.quebec/uploads/article/picture/91044/e2a578b7f700f1ebc767a4d79d48dc02.jpg]. Meanwhile, the Minoans have many depictions in images and statues of women wearing dresses that expose the entire volume of their breasts including nipples. In ancient Greece and Rome, sports and exercise were at least sometimes (maybe even often) performed naked while statues showing the ideal male figure depict completely nude men sculpted meticulously in marble and likely displayed in full colour (Roman statues were coloured when they were made, but people think they were always a shiny blank white). Nude people were even depicted in ancient Greek pottery.\n\nI was considering what influences to use for different areas of my world, how much clothing they should use based on preference and the temperate to subpolar climate of the valley, and the info that fur coats and feather plumage (most sapients are mammalian carnivores and omnivores like wolves, foxes, lions, tigers, otters, polecats, leopards, bears and fewer humans with the exception of some avians) would make clothing less comfortable or even entirely unnecessary (but I still want to have *some* civilian clothing, uniforms, royal clothing and metal armour). There would surely be some cultures and individuals who wear less during certain events or by preferences, but I don't want to have everyone naked because it *could* look odd next to the grand palaces and modern machinery like cars, as well as making it harder to tell groups apart if I'm only going on regional fur colours/patterns and the features of the occasional human (not as common in the region).\n\n=================================\n\n\nFor your worlds:\n\nHow do you handle this? Where do your cultures fall on the scale of modesty (I'm assuming different standards in different cultures of the same world)?\n\nAre some standards region specific due to separation from other cultures and/or unique environmental conditions (such as a cold region wearing more than other cold regions or a tropical region where villages built around water allow people to run naked) or are standards shared across more than a few cultures?\n\nDo some perform sports, rituals and/or other activities naked or almost naked? Is there a significance to this lack of clothing or is is simply a cultural preference? \n\nIs nudity depicted either sexually, scientifically or just purely artistically in pottery, frescoes, paintings, sculptures and statues? \n\nAre there different standards for men and women (like men being able to show nipples while women couldn't in recent Western history) or do they apply to both (such as not that long ago in some Western countries, I think the USA, where even men weren't allowed to be topless at beaches). Is even some nudity allowed in public, casual settings like markets, or are they restricted to less public settings like bathhouses? \n\nAre the bathing areas separated or shared (like some onsen in Japan ancient Roman bathhouses)? Are they segregated by sex (at least some Roman bathhouses had women use them in the morning and men in the afternoon to keep them separated).\n\nIs there a specific age or stage of life when a society in your world has deemed someone old enough to view nudity? Is it something that is generally hidden from younger members or such activities and artistic depictions seen as normal viewings for families in those cultures (like having parents and kids viewing such sporting events in coliseums or seeing nude depictions on statues around the streets)? \n\nAre such depictions in art and activities more common among upper classes or lower classes? Is nudity more common in the upper or lower classes? How do attitudes about nudity differ or relate between the upper classes and lower classes? How do you think these attitudes and practices would differ in your worlds if they were historically inspired fantasy vs sci-fi?\n\nIf humans are one of multiple or don't exist among your sapient species, how do nonhuman cultures handle nudity? How do the cultures of elves, dwarves, orcs and dragons differ from those of humans in this matter (I'm not going on the assumption that each species shares a singular culture like the culture of hats trope. I'm allowing for answers where each species may have multiple cultures and positions)? If you have a completely custom made species that aren't based on typical fantasy species or animals of Earth(like mine are), how does this topic apply to your species' societies? Does their biology even allow clothes? This can also apply for alien societies whether humanoid in shape or not.\n\nHow is nudity depicted in various media of your world? What are the average attitudes towards the depictions of nudity in these media that exist in your world?\n\n=====================================\n\n\nOut of world:\n\nI don't plan on publishing any stories or hosting any D&D or other games/adventures in my world, but I do plan to eventually draw pictures of it in the future, at least for myself and maybe publishing here if I'm still using Reddit at that time. I'm just worldbuilding for fun and putting modern technology in iron age styled cities so there won't be any serious stories with deep characters.\n\nAs for you, if you do plan on making/hosting games, stories, comics, animations, pictures or whatever else for others to experience, do you plan on showing or describing any of these aspects of your worlds to others or would these remain as more hidden or even secret parts of your worlds?\n\nEdit: Apparently and unfortunately, the links don't work as I expected so I had to remove them. They linked to images I wanted to use as examples.\n\nLapis_Wolf ",

            "As far as I've come up with in-universe: in the more *developed* parts of my fantasy setting, nudity is only really common in art and a few niche communities or locations (some nobles often have gatherings where they are totally nude, funnily enough).\n\nMeanwhile in the \"less-developed\" parts of the world, individuals tend to wear long clothing that reveals very little skin (depending on the species). This is not for the sake of modesty, this is more of protection against environmental factors such as insects and the elements.\n\nFor a more *defined* example (or maybe even explaination): the nation of Abaryssia kind of requires that people in public cover up. On-stage performers are somewhat exempt from this, as they are permitted to wear less clothing, but not to the point where it reveals sexual body parts (women can't be topless, and both genders still have to cover up downstairs).\n\nAnd this is all I have come up with for now.",
            "i havent delved into this in most parts of Ayia yet, but in Gaton, showing your face is considered intimate, reserved for family, or for the more extreme, sexual partners. How much of the face is covered, how tight the group you show your face to, and the surrounding clothing varies region to region and city state to city state, but generally, in public, at least half of the face will always be covered. Its very much not about being covered head to toe, but the regions bordering other cultures tend to be fully covered to adhere to neighboring modesty standards as well as their own. By the lakes and around the deserts, however, youll often see fully masked individuals topless, as that doesnt really play into their own modesty standards.\n\nThe style of covering also varies, from half face masks to veils and everything in between. \n\nRestaurants as we know them dont really exist, and are instead more akin to a very clean public bathroom, with a series of stalls/booths, separated by door or curtain, and eating in public really isnt very common. depending on who you're talking to, inviting someone for tea or a meal could mean anything from \"i appreciate you and see you as family\" to \"lets bang freaky style\". \n\nBecause of the nature of interactions in Gaton, the language is VERY precise, as facial expressions are non existent.",
            "Most of my creations are Naturists culturally. They just see nothing wrong with it and wear clothes either as protection or decoration.",
            "So my Sub-race of Humans, the Hypnir, as well as the Sun Elves, who are both nomadic people who co-exist in a Grasslands/desert region, are extremely open about their nudity... within the confines of their sweatlodges, which are not segregated by Sex, though they won't hesitate to fight in the nude, if in the rare example, they are attacked while in the sweatlodges.  **This was inspired by something similar from the Aiel, of Wheel of Time**.  \n\nHigh Elves dress pretty immodestly (by human standards) when among close friends and family, within their own family gardens.  For them its a sign of relaxation and trust, there isn't really any 'sexual' connotations with this.  When out and about in 'public' they are far more modest in dress.  \n\nThe Dragorans (High Humans) dress and act very modestly, but are very casual with forms of art, like paintings and sculptures depicting the nude bodies of men and women, and they can be found and seen pretty much anywhere.",
            "Depends on the culture. Some are more scandalized by nudity than others. There's a few that just walk around naked because they don't see the body as inherently taboo or sexual.",
            "People typically dress for their work in Krysa. The major cultural setting would be vaguely Renaissance-esque Europe. A farmer or laborer would wear simple, durable clothing, a teacher or scribe would wear an outfit with plenty of pockets for whatever supplies they needed, & a noble or religious figure would wear rather flamboyant clothing. But overall, showing skin isn't considered taboo. Public nudity is considered a nuisance & a perpetrator will be taken to a watch house & given a warning (as well as some cheap clothing, enough to get them home) & they will suffer a general loss of face in the community. \n\nThe exception is the clergy of a particular aspect of Olaru, the Mother Goddess. The followers of the Fertility  Aspect, Olaru Ambologera, wear, well; to keep it civil: very little. (They'd consider Gerudo outfit Link to be rather modest.) They typically wear just enough to avoid causing problems or for the weather, but a ceremony during a festival or holy day may have them wearing nothing but ceremonial jewelry &/or henna-esque skin dye, or nothing at all.",
            "I handle it in my culture by having everyone walk around stark naked - they're werewolves living in the Mediterranean, so clothing is out of the question...and they like showing off. It works for them, but any Human visiting is likely to be in for a shock - melons and cookies/beans and hot pockets everywhere.\n\nAs for where they fall on the modesty scale, given what I said above they fall under the 'Modesty, what's that?' section. And no segregation of sexes for anything, nor persecution of non-hetero sexualities.",
            "Inside of Krol, the Buw\u00e4r people are very open about nudity. They are covered in thick fur over most of their body and live in a rainforest, so clothing isn't typically needed, though they do wear loose wraps of animal hide over their genitals for added protection in their day to day lives along with woven leaves and vines to help camouflague them during their hunts, and are removed when inside their shelters. Most of their artwork is made using primitive stone tools, and any depictions of a person are done with full nudity. They don't really have any formalized sport, but competition often flairs when engaged in hunting, and it isn't uncommon to see challenges of who can hunt the best with the least amount of protection/camo, resulting in removing their wraps as well.\n\n>I was considering what influences to use for different areas of my world, how much clothing they should use based on preference and the temperate to subpolar climate of the valley, and the info that fur coats and feather plumage (most sapients are mammalian carnivores and omnivores like wolves, foxes, lions, tigers, otters, polecats, leopards, bears and fewer humans with the exception of some avians) would make clothing less comfortable or even entirely unnecessary (but I still want to have some civilian clothing, uniforms, royal clothing and metal armour). There would surely be some cultures and individuals who wear less during certain events or by preferences, but I don't want to have everyone naked because it could look odd next to the grand palaces and modern machinery like cars, as well as making it harder to tell groups apart if I'm only going on regional fur colours/patterns and the features of the occasional human (not as common in the region).\n\nI would say that clothing for a sufficiently advanced enough sapient species is inevitable. If you have carnivorans that have managed to make cars, they likely also know about germ theory, and will have developed some form of clothing simply for sanitation reasons. And any species that advanced will have encountered war, and will inevitably create armour even if they're already sufficiently protected.\n\nThere's also the fact that a lot of clothes are designed purely cosmetically. The ancient Greek Olympics occasionally are depicted with contestants wearing arm bands or ribbons around their waist with specific designs or colours to signify certain ideas such as their prowess in the sport, their allegiances, ethnicities, etc, and this can easily be reproduced with more elaborate clothing that isn't born out of necessity.\n\n>(most sapients are mammalian carnivores and omnivores like wolves, foxes, , tigers, otters, polecats, leopards, bears and fewer\n\nOtters are extremely promiscuous naturally, so a society that is riddled with STDs might enforce Islamic-inspired modesty standards on their females out of necessity and then gradually or simultaneously develop religious reasons to reinforce belief in the practices. Sapient bear-like people might develop a distaste for their own scent, similar to humans, and utilize underwear with floral or earthy scent producers to help mask their musk.\n\nChanges in migration also dictate clothing choices as well. Sapient foxes might be less inclined towards nomadicism once they discover how to domesticate and breed rabbits, and lose the ability to change their coat after settling in a warmer area. Their descendants might need to relocate to a colder environment generations later and find that their lack of coat change requires them to steal the winter coats of other animals like wolves or bison or moose.\n\nLions might lose their manes through sexual selection, or just the general need to have a larger and grander mane would result in them creating headgear meant to replicate the shape of a mane, such as massive scarves or intricate headwraps. Tigers, similar to Spartans covering their bodies for government meetings, might cover their stripes with neutral coloured cloth when in the presence of other tigers as a way to show passivity and avoid starting fights.\n\nIt might also be a great contrast in your world building to have an advanced civilization that *is* constantly naked. What a way to make your empire of bald eagles stand out in any potential audience's mind by having their completely unashamed nudity juxtaposed to their grand palaces full of silk and other fineries.",
            "In my world, as a rule of thumb, take the nudity expectations for men in the real world and apply to all genders. So you wouldn't expect people to walk around in the buff, but nobody would bet an eye if thry saw a shirtless woman working the fields on a hot day, or relaxing at the beach. Of course, many women still prefer to wear something up top that provides breast support, specially while performing physically intensive activities like sports or sparring.\n\nThere are also some cultures where a higher level of nudity during daily life is commonplace, specially in hotter climates. For example, the basic attire for a wild elf from the \u00c8onean Forest, regardless of gender, consists of a loincloth and jewlery. Other cultures, however, can be far more prudish, like the people from the far continent of Nahast. They expect you to cover at least your torso and legs at all times, despite the hot tropical weather, and only show your body to intimate partners. Wearing clothes that show the midriff is a quite scandalous fashion trend among the youth in the region.",

            "In my setting, as long as you aren\u2019t doing anything indecent you aren\u2019t going to get into trouble for being nude. If you\u2019re outside of an area that it\u2019s appropriate to be nude then you\u2019ll likely get odd looks and if you frequently do it you\u2019ll get a less favorable reputation. Though the environment isn\u2019t favorable for being nude on the northern and southern continents and for like half the year on the western continent.",
            "Obligatory \u201cvaries a lot\u201d, but generally the minimum standard outside of saunas/beaches regardless of gender/sex is covered groin, feet, and upper torso \u2013 they\u2019re decently conservative, especially in less temperate areas \u2013 but nudity isn\u2019t especially stigmatized or sexualized",
            "My people are lizards who don't have external genitals or breasts, so they never developed any kind of modesty taboo. They live in a tropical climate, so clothing is purely \"as needed.\" The wealthy will sometimes cover themselves with richly embroidered garments as a status display and mages have an identifying scarf. That's about it.",
            "Clothes aren\u2019t a big deal since everyone either has fur, scales or feathers underneath. Casual nudity is a fashion style like any other, especially when people have exotic fur patterns and colors to display. There are even places where any kind of leg garments are forbidden by law due to lingering cultural traditions. Any sort of taboo or innuendo that comes from wearing your birthday suit simply doesn\u2019t exist",
            "In the empire it's fairly taboo. This is partly because of religion, partly because of beliefs about sexuality (not having sex until the night before your wedding is the norm) and partly because of climate, since it's pretty far north and so nudity is just unbearable most of the year. In art, it's decently normalized, since they're inspired by Greek and also Renaissance era Italy and France, so their statues and architecture are reflections of those real world cultures. In sports they aren't naked either, since they see it we inherently sexual and children attend the events, so they wear tight fitting loincloths and bras when competing.\n\nIn one of my desert cultures, it's very normalized. They never go outside naked, but have many layers of clothes used to protect against the sun and sand, but inside, it's basically all naked all the time, though they wear shoes, loose shirts are common, and they all wear sashes with little pockets on them so they can carry their money and other essentials. They also do sport naked, their art also depicts naked people, and they're also loose about sexuality so art of sexual acts in public spaces and sexual acts in semi public spaces isn't uncommon. Children are not allowed in the semi public sexual spaces, and they're also generally just not really liked by culture in general, since they're restricted from accessing a lot of things, though their education is decent and they're considered adults in most aspects at 14 instead of 18 irl.\n\nThose are the two cultures I have that are furthest on the spectrum of accepting nudity",
            "The only thing that *must* be covered in public is the groin area. Anything else, including toplessness for any gender, is generally allowed. Obviously this is subject to local climate and such.\n\nThis attitude mainly applies to humans, orcs, and elves. Some other races have more of a hangup about it - dwarves and goblins, for example, tend to require more clothing in public to be considered modest.",

            "The United Tribes (humanoid shaped aliens) are not very modest, clothing is largely restricted to being worn for environmental or cleanliness reasons. A big part of this is the number of bony spines on the back, arms, and five furred spiked tentacles that make upper body clothing fairly impractical, though certainly still possible since they are in a pretty standard pattern. This largely means they just short shorts to prevent discharges in communal spaces and nothing else unless needed for a particular activity, like wearing aprons for cooks or smiths. A silk wrap worn over the chest is generally only worn by women who are actively nursing.\n\nUpper and lower class is very fluid, the only real difference is often size of the individual and the number of their scars. Shirts are only common in sports for those with opposing teams for identification reasons and even then largely when performing for a human audience, body paint being more common at home. Solo sports are generally with worn shorts. Pretty much all of the blood sports are performed naked, culturally being seen as getting as close to possible to their natural, primal selves. Rituals are more often done naked than not. \n\nNudity is often not present in art, with individuals being represented by the personal sigils and banding, alongside the sigils and banding used by their particular clan and tribe instead of depictions of the body - the exception being criminals who are depicted with their face and the associated tattoos detailing their crimes. Their art tends to be more symbolic and geometric than having any kind of direct association with the physical.",
            "My main alien species, Ozxians, are heavily covered in feathers. They're sort of like less anthropomorphic Rito from Legend of Zelda. (No, they were not inspired by them.) They do wear what we'd call clothing, but it's generally pretty sparse compared to what humans wear. Mostly ornamental pieces as opposed to actual body coverings. There are full body outfits such as cold weather gear that an Ozx from a warmer region might wear when visiting an Arctic area, but full body outfits are far from the norm.\n\nNudity isn't really seen as weird in Ozxian culture. Walking around one's own house nude would sort of be the equivalent of changing into sweat pants for a human. Leisure clothes.",

            "It kind of depends on the culture, and within cultures it generally depends on context. Among my main culture (late stone age, barely stepping into copper and bronze) it goes something like this: In winters of course everyone covers up as much as possible. In summers it is common for men and children to go topless, wearing only thin woven pants or perhaps shorter pants made from hides. Even when wearing shirts, they are typically sleeveless. Married women often wear long and usually plain looking dresses, while young unmarried women typically wear knee length skirts and either plain sleeveless tops or basically crop tops, but those are a bit controversial for maybe being too revealing. Bathing is generally segregated by sex. If a guy and a girl go bathing together they\u2019re practically married.\nCeremonies are a bit tricky. For example, in one city state the queen is also high priestess to the river goddess, and periodically performs public rituals where she must submerge herself in the river. During this ceremony it is expected that anyone present aside from the other priests and priestesses avert their gaze, even her husband the king. So not looking at her is a matter of divine respect at least as much as it is a matter of modesty. Usually a ritual which requires stripping down like that will be conducted privately.\nMore revealing clothing might appear in the ornate dresses worn at spring and summer festivals, though that really is more up to individual taste and personality. \nIn art, they mostly focus on animals and abstract symbols, depictions of human forms are usually depictions of gods. There is however a common charm or figure that women may give men when they go away on a long journey or to war. It is typically wood, and carved to stylistically represent the female form. Between a husband and wife, it will spiritually keep her by his side and hopefully guide him home to her, and from an unmarried woman it is generally given with a wink and a smile, a promise of what the young man can look forward to if he returns in triumph.",

They are worn as loose draping sashes over one shoulder and the chest, capable of being grabbed and knotted quickly to tighten if necessary; sometimes as layered knee-mid thigh lengthed skirts. Some times as hooded shaws. It\u2019s a very adaptable piece of clothing. Catching sight of someone genitals wouldn\u2019t be uncommon and it\u2019s given little attention or consideration.

Underkin holds do not want to risk babies of unrecorded heritage, or gods forbid, babies of tangled heritage (aka inbred within great-great-grandparents). \n\nThe Karanai, by contrast, are a tropical culture that typically only wear a loincloth and functional clothes (a satchel or rucksack, a small blanket, a toolbelt) unless weather requires more. Children typically run nude, in loincloths, or in simple shifts. \n\nMany nomadic cultures base their seasonal dress and expectations of modesty on the weather in their location.

You keep your neck to yourself. \n\nFinally (for now lol), cultures that worship either the sun or moon goddess will be more conservative when their symbol of worship is in the sky. As in, if you are in Leffelton (a solar town), you would cover your body to the elbows and knees, but at night? Niva's asleep baby, go nuts show nuts.\n\n**Edit:** To expand slightly (to honor the effort of your post lol), the hands and lower half of the face must always be exposed except if you are in PPE. In Underkin art, covering either of these indicates a villain or traitor.\n\nAlso, the beast races tend not to wear many if any clothes regardless because of their natural adaptations to their environment. As a result, the Vuuri (a humanoid race) will depict heroes, spiritual leaders, chiefs, etc as nude to show their attunement to Erranda and victory over its dangers. Vuuri themselves tend to live in harsh environments in secluded communities, so they can't often go nude because of the dangers.",

            ">Where do your cultures fall on the scale of modesty?\n\nHumans and Elves are the two cultures that are more prominent. Humans are generally more modest and less open than Elves, but it's on a sliding scale for both. \n\n>Do some perform sports, rituals and/or other activities naked or almost naked? Is there a significance to this lack of clothing or is is simply a cultural preference? \n\nIn Elf culture, when a couple starts dating seriously, they visit the onsen together and bathe each other. Clothing is generally not advised. \n\n>Is nudity depicted either sexually, scientifically or just purely artistically in pottery, frescoes, paintings, sculptures and statues? \n\nAll of the above. \n\n>Are there different standards for men and women (like men being able to show nipples while women couldn't in recent Western history) or do they apply to both (such as not that long ago in some Western countries, I think the USA, where even men weren't allowed to be topless at beaches). Is even some nudity allowed in public, casual settings like markets, or are they restricted to less public settings like bathhouses? \n\nIn general, both cultures and genders wear reserved clothes. Most shorts/skirts will be slightly above the knee. Tank tops are considered underwear for both genders. Conversely, Bikinis exist, and guys can wear only swim trunks. Public nudity is banned. \n\n>Are the bathing areas separated or shared (like some onsen in Japan ancient Roman bathhouses)? Are they segregated by sex (at least some Roman bathhouses had women use them in the morning and men in the afternoon to keep them separated).\n\nSome onsen permit mixed bathing. Some onsen have staff of both genders who will bathe you. In the castle, there is a position called steward of the bath who does laundry/ barber/ bathing. The MC's steward of the bath is a very attractive busty woman and when the MC contracts Wasting Sickness and the steward of the bath has to bathe him.\n\n>Is there a specific age or stage of life when a society in your world has deemed someone old enough to view nudity? Is it something that is generally hidden from younger members or such activities and artistic depictions seen as normal viewings for families in those cultures (like having parents and kids viewing such sporting events in coliseums or seeing nude depictions on statues around the streets)? \n\nNot as such.\n\n>How is nudity depicted in various media of your world? What are the average attitudes towards the depictions of nudity in these media that exist in your world?\n\nAnything from tasteful to gratuitous. Not everyone wants to see it, but most people aren't going to be offended if they see it.",

            "There are multiple cultures seen, each with their own rules. But there's some common ground. The northern areas are very, very cold. There's snow 9 months of the year. So people wear thicker clothes with multiple layes that cover everything beneath their head. So a large majority of the body is considered intimate/sexual, regardless of gender. Even in the warmest summers, it's usually still long sleeves and bottoms, because that's seen as modest.\n\nThen the southern areas are all warmer, fitting a more balanced change of seasons. The southern regions have way more diversity between the specific areas, but as a whole, they wear less/shorter clothes, and their ideas of modesty tend to line up closer to our modern real-world ones. The most obvious outlier is a region near the ocean with a very water-focussed culture. Since they spend most of their day going in and out of the water, even fewer clothes than usual are common, and so is nudity. They basically have no care for any real modesty rules or standards because of that. \n\nSo yeah, it's very different depending on the area, definitely gives travelers some serious culture shock, lol.",

Though overall public nudity is not frowned upon, people might look \ud83d\udc40 at you askance for being nude. Most cultures are still hunter gathering societies, though agriculture is starting to appear. Most people in every region still wear animal skins for clothing, but some textiles have started to be produced and worn.\n\nBathing is usually alone, though there are exceptions. Purification bathing prior to or after certain rituals can be done alone or in groups, usually separated by gender, but in certain situations with the clergy, it may be mixed. There are no restrictions on bathing with one\u2019s mate.\n\nThere are a few different styles of clothing, depending upon the occasion. Matrimonial clothing becomes formal wear for important occasions, including most ceremonies. Everyday wear for the day to day activities, though hunting usually includes layers due excursion and location. There are specialized ceremonies and festivals where minimal clothing is worn. One is to initiate adolescents into adulthood. For another, as long as individuals are considered adults, anyone can have sexual relations with anyone, with consent, regardless of marital status.",

            "A little backstory before I go into detail: My feline race lives in a mountainous basin. Basically, their territory involves a large lake. This lake provides much of their food supplies via fishing and they fish with wooden spears. The fish do not have any natural predators, so they never learned to fear anything. This makes diving underwater and spearing the fish their preferred method.\n\nSo, nudity in this society is sexual in certain circumstances and not sexual in others. It all depends on the context. A person being naked in the context of fishing in the mentioned lake is not viewed in a sexual manner by society, but if that person were to suddenly leave the lake and traverse around the cobbled roads with their dangalang or bobbies out then that would be viewed in a sexual manner. Of course, intention also matters. You can't get naked and have a wank beside the lake and culturally \"get away with it\" because wanking is still a sexual movement.\n\nIt is also frowned upon to \"gawk\" at those fishing in the lake.",

So, for instance, my \u201cmain empire\u201d has its capital in a region with a pretty Mediterranean climate. They arose from the mixing of colonists and explorers from a culture who wore more clothing to protect themselves from the cold, that came from a colder region; and a culture who wear lots of thin, though well-covering clothing to protect from sunlight, who came from a desert.\n\nEven though the geography would incline the empire to wear less, they then to cover up because that\u2019s what they see as civilized. They essentially wear very thin, very loose and flowy garments. \n\nThey\u2019re actually pretty prudish and nobles will often bathe and change alone in separate cubicles.

Life elves stop outwardly aging after the age of maturity (18) but female elves still only have 32 years generally of being fertile and male elves slowly lose fertility over the course of their lives aswell. \nAs a result and due to how much space their homelands have they are extremely promiscuous between the ages of maturity and the age of barrenness.\n\nI should mention the only other kind of elf I have currently planned are death elves.

The Saurisaan (lizard men) don\u2019t have exposed testicles or breasts and their body is covered is leathery scales, and the climate they live in warm and humid, so the majority of time you\u2019ll see the peasants in nothing but a loincloth, while more wealthy ones like the merchants, the nobility, and especially the Emperor will typically wear silk clothes as a way to show off their wealth, with most merchants opting for a one piece silk tunic that can reach the thigh.      \nThe Snow Elves similarly don\u2019t wear a lot of clothes, and the clothes they do wear are typically thin and light.

            "The elves living in the mountain cities of Estor Eisle have a cultural idea of nudity being unsanitary.  This came about long ago due to a deadly plague which spread via skin contact.  Though the plague has long since been eradicated, it left a lasting impact on the elves\u2019 culture.  They\u2019re really uptight about the amount of visible skin that\u2019s considered hygenic.  Everything above the wrists and below the neck needs to be covered up, and particularly old-fashioned people even cover their throats and the backs of their hands.  The mountain cities have a cool climate throughout the year, so it isn\u2019t inconvenient to dress this way.  \n\nIn the modern day, elvish women have a little more leeway with this than the men.  It\u2019s okay for the skin of a woman\u2019s dominant arm up to the shoulder to be visible, as long as she wears a shawl draped over it to give a basic impression of\u2026 not modesty, but cleanliness or purity, I suppose.  This is because for a lot of complex social and biological reasons, women do the fighting in this culture, and need their sword arms to be unhindered by the loose and flowy garments that are in fashion lately.  Women\u2019s fashions often take heavy inspiration from elvish military uniforms, so even women who will never do any fighting tend to dress this way.\n\nBecause the taboo-ness comes specifically from the idea of skin contact being unclean, people are perfectly chill with artistic nudes.  (You wouldn\u2019t feel the same revulsion from a painting of rotting food that you might if you saw something rotten on a plate in front of you, where it might be able to touch you.)  Rather than being titillating, nudity in art is more often used to represent violence, corruption, and death.  A painting or sculpture of a naked woman might be representing a warrior going berserk on a battlefield, or a sick or injured person lying vulnerable at death\u2019s door.  If you were to paint a naked man, it might also be a way of showing him to be effeminate, completely overcome with strong emotion, or politically corrupt.  Aschel, the goddess of poison and disease, is generally depicted naked in artwork.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the merfolk have no visible exterior genitalia, and living underwater makes most clothing inconvenient - or even dangerous if you\u2019re trying to swim away from a predator and your clothing is creating too much drag.  Nudity is pretty much the default in their culture.  They\u2019ll dress in the clothing of other cultures if they\u2019re visiting those places, but they tend to feel pretty uncomfortable in it and will shed it whenever possible.

Only cheap slumlord houses, and ones that aren\u2019t actually meant for bathing, allow for mixed bathing. \n\nIn the Free City League, the most popular religion is the Worship of the Maidens. Of which there are three major denominations. The first of which is referred to as the \u201cClothed Maidens\u201d, the really only hold sway in the northern regions of League where there is a lot of cultural influence from more prudish cultures like Leones and Rossoya. The second is referred to as the \u201cNaked Maidend\u201d which earned its name from the fact that all of its depictions of the maidens completely nude, the faith associating nudity with purity. This also means that a lot of its rituals invoking purity, like confessions, marriages, births, and the like require the participant to be stripped completely naked for the entirety of the ritual. The third denomination are the \u201cVirgin Maidens\u201d, they are the most dominant denomination due to the fact they walk the line between the somewhat heretical Clothed and overly traditionalist Naked sects. For example, depictions of the maidens in their temples, while naked, normally use things like hair or conveniently placed objects to hide their nudity without actually clothing them and when preforming their rituals, a marriage for example, they will only require the bride, groom, and officiating priests to be naked instead of everyone attending.\n\nIn the Freehold of Tyrish. Where the men of the Sacred Band, their warrior society, are obligated  honor bound to remain in the nude, save for their weapons, shield, and helmets when the city isn\u2019t at war. Prostitutes are legally forbidden to wear any cloth above the waist. Slaves aren\u2019t even permitted that much and forced to go naked save for a brand placed upon the smalls of their backs. And the priesthoods often carry out public rituals involving the men and women randomly picked off the streets to strip off their clothes to be anointed in the blood of Baathazal or dunked in fountains of water dedicated to the gods to wash away a person\u2019s sins.",
            "My human cultures dress modestly but not overly so. Pants and dresses are expected except for those working hard labor in the summer. Laborers in shorts on a hot day isn't uncommon. When it comes to sleeves, anything is acceptable. Long, short, none at all, it's all fine.  When it comes to the church figures, covering up all but the face is mandatory for both men and women.\n\nElves are more in tune with nature and have no qualms about nudity although thats only common in warmer months. They are proud to consider themselves animals of the woods and \"you wouldn't blush at seeing a naked deer now, would you?\" They regularly wear clothes, though. Less for propriety and more to protect their skin from brambles and bushes. Their clothes are almost completely utilitarian.\n\nNam Schlur, don't wear clothes. They live in hotter regions such as deserts and the warm canyons on the edges of their deserts. That coupled with the fact they have tough skin that can withstand sandstorms and you'll see they never really needed clothes. It also doesn't help that their large bodies and large hands aren't good for creating garments. Their sexual organs are hidden so modesty isn't an issue. They may wear woven ropes of riverweed around their odd bodies or mark themselves with paints for ceremonial purposes as well as to express to others their position, status, occupation, tribe, etc. When they venture into cold lands, they will wear long wraps bought from humans around their gourdlike figure to stay warm. They mostly find the sensation of clothes unpleasant.\n\nThe Elgar are a nomadic people who's whole lifestyle is funded by textiles. While most other races fail to see the beauty in this races features, no one can deny their eye for patterns and styles. They travel far and wide between many races lands bringing exotic styles and buying materials to sell and create with. Their bodies are covered in shaggy fur, so modesty in dress isn't an issue. They dress purely for fashion. Anything goes. Some may be wearing nice patterned slacks and a jacket, others might wear some more experimental stuff like a \"shirt\" that is just three pedals of cloth held a foot away from the elgars fur by wire in the seams to evoke the shape of a flower, then others, usually the leather workers, might just wear boots, gloves, and a hat, to advertise their wares.",

For example, if one was to roam the established cities all dirty with ruffled, messy hair, they'd be perceived negatively. In a couple cultures, they may even throw rocks if they feel threatened in any way.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that my world has a focus on energies that quietly influence the world, a bit like leylines or the like. There's a culture of people that developed an altered constitution just based off of the lingering energy there. This energy made them more sensitive to moisture, but more reliant on it for survival. Perhaps the other energies aren't as strong, but they have their effects.",

There just aren't enough depictions of nudity in video games, anime, and anime video games that aren't totally juvenile. Yes, naked people can be hot, can we try putting them in for a different reason now?\n\nSince I didn't clarify it above: my general policy is that if something exists you should be able to see it, so no keeping that stuff away from audience view and only referring to it for me.

            "I really only have a couple cultures I have even given any thought to, but I develop deep histories. And approaches towards modesty changes over time in every culture where I have devoted time to it so far. I'll restrict my comments to that relating to the most-thought-through, the Nel-speakers (although cultural unity amongst them has ebbed and flowed). And they are all human, I'm way more into culture and history than biology so sadly I don't have a bunch of species.\n\nHistorically, nudity for the Nel has been linked to power --  and linked with cleanliness (and thus religious concerns) too. Someone dirty and nude is ritually dirtier than someone dirty and clothed, but someone clean and nude is ritually cleaner. Obviously this has power connections: someone with a leaky roof, a dirty floor, and has to go outside every day (let alone someone who farms!) will find cleanliness harder to maintain than someone who can spend time cleaning themselves, have a solid and soot-free house, and can avoid the dirtiness of the outside. Sort of like how a king in armour implies vulnerability -- he needs armour.\n\nNudity is permitted in public but with the cleanliness facet tends to be rare outdoors -- although half-clothed (usually bottom-half) in public is marginally more common in cases like that. There are some rituals where nudity is required. Sports are pretty much always clothed though (cleanliness again). The standards for genders are the same with minor variations for rituals. Nudity is depicted however people want -- but as this took place in the before-now, the scientific qualities were minimal versus the religious qualities which dominated.\n\nBathhouses aren't much of a thing. No specific ages, although due to the cleanliness requirements and the fact children are frequently dirty, children themselves are often clothed.\n\nLater on, the then-leading aristocrats ended up losing much of their power, and with a change in religious sentiment the whole upper-class nudity thing became seen as reactionary and thus fell out of favour for most who previously would have done it frequently. The whole outward display of ritual/political status by the increasingly-impoverished aristocrats ran afoul with both the newer more hands-on mass landholders as well as the increasingly-wealthy merchants. In contrast to the distant aristocrats who lived distantly from their lands, the newer landholders lived on their lands and sought greater yields -- forcing them to supervise -- and the merchants being merchants went outside. And the abandonment of 75% of the traditional priesthood reduced the religious pressure for traditional cleanliness-linked-nudity. Outwardly displaying \"I'm a highly privileged aristocrat!\", especially as your powers were falling and yet peasants still disliked you was risky, even ignoring for the changing personal and religious feelings many aristocrats felt.\n\nModern Nels are thus clothes-wearers more than their distant ancestors.\n\nI don't plan on doing anything with my world unless I become independently wealthy enough to finance a crazy film set in it. So nothing in-real-life concerns me about my world's historical use of nudity.",

Nudity is also featured in sport. Bathhouses are gendered establishments also.\n\nSimilarly, flinging aside one\u2019s blanket/cloak is an expression of honesty and open amiability, originating from an ancient custom of often disrobing nude for meetings or treaty to show that one was unarmed and trustworthy.

            "As with most things in my worlds, different cultures handle nudity differently. I will mainly focus on the Redstonian sphere here because I have a lot.\n\nThe earliest culture here would be the Mazaurans. The Mazaurans at the time were predominantly marui (sapient felids), and like other felids, they have fur. At this point in history clothing was less of a practical concern due to the fur, although Mazaura is a bit colder than what they were adapted for.\n\nAs such, early Mazauran (4th-3rd millennium BC) clothing was quite lightweight. They also covered their nether regions, presumably for sanitary or protective reasons. In southern Mazaura where it was colder, Mazauran clothing was suitably less revealing than in the north. However nudity was not really seen as an issue, and they viewed clothing as a largely practical affair.\n\nWhen humans arrived onto the scene, first with the Penulians (8th century BC), there was quite a bit of cross-cultural exchange. In particular, the Penulians wore more clothing, and while nudity wasn't seem as sexual, it was seen as shameful, and there were status based variations in clothing. Over time however the two attitudes started to blend together a bit, and you have for example northern marui wearing \"southern styles\", while human clothing became more inspired by the marui.\n\nThe arrival of the Deglani (4th century BC) into the region ended up having a different sort of effect. At this point the Mazaurans were seen as a grand civilisation, one the ruled the entire world, and so while cultural diffusion did occur, with the Deglani it was a bit one-sided. The Deglani ended up adopting human Mazauran fashion, with some of their traditional clothing evolving into a separate \"riding uniform\".\n\nAs such, by the time we get to the early Redstonians (2nd century AC), things haven't changed that much. Being completely nude was still seen as shameful for humans, and they also felt a similar way about just having underwear in most circumstances, but otherwise being revealing wasn't a big issue. The Redstonians did also have varying types of clothing for different statuses, a few examples of which actually came from the Mazaurans (one being the \"grand second tail\", a cape-like garment used by orators for a greater delivery).\n\nOver time as the Redstonians developed, clothing standards changed. Earlier Redstonian garments largely derived from northern Mazauran tradition, and was generally quite light and loose. However the more tailored southern clothing started to become popular among the elite, and this filtered down to wealthier non-elites. Even some of the marui got involved, liking the new style. This soon led to more revealing styles being seen as shameful among elites, a norm that high ranking marui often ignored like other social norms.\n\nWith Antiudectism (10th century AC) this changed again, with the reduction of unnecessary social norms being part of it. This was one of them, and in fact some even eschewed clothing altogether, being shamelessly nude. Mostly however they just wore what they wanted (and could afford). For example, Duimmaro, though having quite a high rank as personal friend of the emperor, wore a kind of outfit more fit for a peasant (it originally was such an outfit, he just never changed it).\n\nThis became quite popular for a brief period after the Redstonian Revolution (11th century AC), however this was soon reversed by the New Redstonists, a religious offshoot of Antiudectism that brought back the modest norms from before the revolution. Given that marui generally didn't like New Redstonism for various reasons, their clothing did tend to be more revealing than human clothing at this time.\n\nThe Second Revolution (16th century AC) was sort of a backlash against the sort of norms that developed after the Redstonian Revolution, and has parallels to the first one in origins, though it wasn't a civil war this time, just a cultural revolution. One element of this revolution was that marui became quite popular as their natural state was seen as close to this revolution's ideals. So, the relative immodesty of marui became popular. On the other hand, clothing was also become far less expensive at this time, so there was also less of a reason to not cover up.\n\nThis led to a somewhat tumultuous time in terms of acceptability of immodesty. Some were more than willing to go topless, while some would never show their legs, for example. This somewhat confusing situation took a while to resolve. Like before, the New Redstonists were largely the bastion of modesty, and so modesty became associated with religiosity. Immodesty, then, was largely associated with groups like the marui and Fidmefists, where irreligion was quite common.\n\nAnd so with the First Sand War (19th century AC), the rise of Sefeiuntism and the Auto-Reds led to the decline of modesty. In fact, while the Fliudero isn't exactly naked in human form, he does like to wear casual clothing even in official functions, and can even be seen in revealing clothing sometimes. This also spread downwards, along with other aspects of Auto-Red society, leading to a kind of \"social flattening\" effect among the Auto-Reds.",
            "I have many cultures and groups across projects that cover the entire spectrum of views towards nudity. I will briefly showcase two this time:\n\n- The Ayu people that originally unified the solar system had nudity quite normalised, specially amongst the upper class where showing skin was considered a sign of prestige since it allowed people to see the perfectly contoured body you have worked so hard for (and probably had many expensive modifications to) in all the free time those plebs don't get. Being completely naked was still taboo, but beyond that anyone regardless of gender often wore little or transparent clothing. That said, showing your legs was seen as immodest, and in the case of men hair too. This changed towards the very long lifespan of the empire as a reaction of the fame the aristocracy had garnered as opulent, decadent, out of touch, and boastful, with dress covering a lot more than it used to.\n\n- The Zi  people exist in the opposite side of the spectrum, where even showing your face in public was frown upon at points. Their culture was deeply religious and collectivist in the worst sense posible, and they believed the self to be an illusion that should be shattered for the good of everyone and to be able to leave the material work. Hence, showing your face was a sign you were not willing to do that.",

That being said, Earth is the home of humans and many of its original inhabitants still live there, by virtue of certain medical advances increasing their lifespans. A lot of the older generations still feel some discomfort about exposing themselves, which I think would be the case.\n\nThen there are people who live in space. Naturally for these people, protective clothing is a must. Spacesuits, or the modern variety at least, are very much like a second skin to most. They are designed to be worn pretty much all the time and are therefore very comfortable and as unrestrictive as possible, but can seal up at a moments notice if you wanted to go outside. Their aversions to nudity in this case is more out of a sense practicality and safety, as apposed to some taboo about immodesty.\n\nFinally, I give you the people of the ocean planet Diluvia. Diluvians are on the whole very partial to nudity, mostly because they spend a lot of their lives swimming. Quite a few have undergone modifications to their physiology, to better adapt themselves to a marine environment.

They do this through \"soft\" actions, such as controlling long distance communication and maintaining economically critical machinery, but also \"hard\" actions such as threatening to bomb dissidents as the sole airborne power in the setting. \n\nHowever, the justification Guild uses, is that they are an impartial force of peace, that enforces order between nations, that without their oversight the kings and politicians would use the technology to wage wars between each other that could quickly escalate in a global bloodbath.\n\nThe Hypocrisy is especially highlighted by the fact that Guild officials are quite happy to be chummy with tyrants, robber barons, and colonial expositors, as long as status quo is maintained, with a rebellion of the downtrodden against an oppressive regime being just as much of a threat to international peace in the eyes of the Guild, as a opportunistic conflict between two states.",

This period was characterized by the shift from the idea of magic as a divine right of the nobility to the idea that it is instead inherent among humans. This led to the rise of liberal democracy and the falling out between the ruling elite and the people. \n\nThe Liberation War saw conflict between the nations who have transitioned to democratic governance and the dying breed of monarchical and authoritarian regimes. Verune was the primary power of the former. It began the rhetoric of Verune as THE ally of democracy and self-determination. Seems familiar? \n\nHaving ended in stalemate, the war set in doubts within allied countries about Verune's 'brand' of democracy. Smaller regional and civil conflicts persisted, challenging the idea of liberalism with the desire for security.\n\nAnd so Verune took action. To protect this 'brand' of democracy and maintain its vast empire of alliances, it began military campaigns to intervene and help quell these conflicts in a limited capacity. The largest of which is in a neighboring country, the Kingdom of Estacia. \n\nAnd that is how it came to be, that the Republic of Verune maintained a large active armed force even amidst relative peace with peer nations."
