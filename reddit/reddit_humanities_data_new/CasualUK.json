            "I'm going to a day event called BS3. It's mostly garage, rnb and a bit of dnb. Gonna be cheesey but hopefully really fun! I'm going with my best friend who I've not been out with in years so I'm really looking forward to it.",
            "Last night I passed out at 8pm, which is incredibly unusual as normally my insomnia keeps me awake until at least midnight. Maybe I need to start getting up very early every morning.\n\n\nThe plan for today is to tackle the garden. I doubt we'll get it all done but who knows?\n\n\nI'd like to go somewhere this weekend, even if it's just a park or something.",

I'm used to gulping near boiling tea like a tea drain, so sedentary slow metal straw sucking is doing my head in. I might need to switch to necking an can of iced coffee for 6 months.\n\nAny why even go through all of this? For what? Because executive teams do secretly give or don't give out promotions all beause someone doesn't have nice teeth? Am I doing all of this just to climb the ladder so I can have piles of cash? Actually when you put it like that it seems fine.\n\nI don't agree people should be judged based on their teeth, but they are, and I am, so I'm putting that stray front tooth back in it's place.\n\nAlso I've got a lisp for the next sixth months, which there's also nothing wrong with, however, it is funny if you've never had one and then suddenly get one.\n\nGot this metal straw clanging against my cup of tea is annoying. Perhaps I should lob my tea out of the window?",

Spend a couple of hours then 60 miles home. 2 hours of visiting in a non kid house plus 120 miles in the car is as much as my kids can handle so we won't stay longer than that (they will have their kids kindles and some drawing stuff and books, but still). I've got loads of jobs to do around the house but I'm still not 100% having had 2 days off sick this week so I think I'll do some laundry but otherwise chill for the afternoon. Maybe I'll make lists/plans of what date in the future I could do those chores so that I feel productive without having to actually shift my arse.",

The machine does most of the work, and if I'm lucky the weather will hold so I can dry the shirts outside.\n\nThat's a very nice garden, BTW.  I'm still struggling to establish my little garden. Somehow my mother's green-thumb genes skipped my generation. The best I can do is keep the more aggressive weeds under control, sweep up the litter that collects around the house, and water/fertilise the handful of potted plants that seem to have survived my ignorance.\n\n  \nBut a sunny June Saturday in England is a great time and place to be.",
            "Weekly shop done in record time, even with a shopping list nearly twice the length than usual! Granted, a decent chunk of that was for food tomorrow for a barbecue!\n\nI've been awake since 4:30am because some arsehole magpies were going mental for a good two hours. I suspect it was a tabby cat that sometimes passes through our gardens but they weren't having any of it. I normally don't mind magpies, think they're quite comical at times but not this morning.",

Wtf is going on this year not been this bad for years I actually thought last year I'd outgrown it or something.\n\n\nThose expensive\u00a0 \"24 hour\" 2nd gen fexofenadine tablets ain't doing much either and wearing off by mid afternoon.

            "Yeah, it's been brutal, I get it bad most years anyway, but my wife and dad get it very mildly, but even they've been saying it's really bad.\n\nLoratadine's always been reliable for me. I also use the benacort nasal spray, which is fantastic. \n\nI'd recommend getting a gel filled eye mask and putting that in the fridge. When your eyes are raw and you put that on, it's the most pleasurable feeling.",

            "Probably best to just not throw any animals in water unless they\u2019re a fish",
            "I\u2019ve seen a video of someone doing just that",
            "The tortoise won\u2019t understand which word I use.",
            "Slinging usually is bad for most things to be fair.\n\nExcept limbs.",
            "Calling a tortoise would still be correct though, I believe you mean:\n\n>You should generally use the more specific term",
            "You shouldn't really help animals, period. Unless they're in the middle of a road or something. If you're extremely concerned then call a professional tbh. See https://www.wildlifeaid.org.uk/helping-wildlife-in-need\n\n> Our advice is ALWAYS given in the spirit of putting the animal first. In some circumstances the advice might be to do nothing; in others we may advise you to bring the animal to us\n\nHelping an animal may adversely affect them and in worse case, either inadvertently kill them or force them to become non-releasable whilst living in a sanctuary.",
            "What if that was my hobby though?",
            "It would be the \u201cmore precise\u201d or \u201cspecific\u201d term, rather than correct. As turtle is still the correct term",
            "That\u2019s a fantastic analogy for something. Are the Ninja turtles tortoises or turtles then?",
            "Sorry to break it to you, but it never ends\n\nI got up at 3am this morning to drive my 18 year-old to an airport 100 miles away. Just got back. \n\nThen there\u2019s the picking them up late because they can\u2019t get a taxi, helping them get cleaned up when they over indulge (which can start any time in their teens)\n\nAnd the older ones are only too happy to leave their own sprogs with us whenever it looks like I\u2019m in danger of a lie-in\n\n(Love that last one really \ud83e\udd23)",
            "My nephew's always been told his willy is his Micky. Last week he was finally introduced to Micky Mouse.\n\n\nHe was a bit incredulous.",
            "Up until recently we had a membership at Chester, now a membership at South Lakes. I\u2019ve not been for a few months, but he went with his mum on Tuesday. \n\nFor those interested, Chester is a 10/10 zoo whose contributions to wildlife and commitment to animal welfare is brilliant. South Lakes is more interactive, has far better food/amenities and is so cheap. But is a *for* profit zoo, which in the past has had questions about their commitment to animal welfare (and zookeeper welfare). I would recommend a membership to both.\n\nTo be fair, if we didn\u2019t have plans this afternoon we probably would be. Might try and figure out if we can squeeze it in tomorrow. Our weekends have been rammed for a while!",
            "Ha! I\u2019m fairly sure Norman Price is in prison now.",
            "Especially as there will come a time when they don't even want to watch TV with you.",
            "Well yeah that's obvious, they're the crime busters of the sea.",
            "Sharky and George, crime busters of the sea. I loved that show. Thanks for the memory.",
            "I can still hear my dad shouting Thundercats are goooooooo!",
            "Same here. Samurai Pizza Cats, Sharky and George, T-Rex... any TMHT knock off going.\n\nThrow in Trans World Sport and OU / David Attenborough / Chart Show and its a perfect weekend morning up to the age of about 12.",
            "Those were the best days. The problem I see now is that kids get on streaming services instead so it's not just an episode of looney toons and done. It has to be 10 episodes one after the other or they kick off.\u00a0",
            "I was an early riser as well and a bit of an escape artist. Managed to climb out of my cot for the first time when I was 10 months old. Luckily, my dad woke just then, otherwise, I would have fallen down.\n\nBy the time I was 2, I was going down the stairs by myself at 6 in the morning to watch TV and I would wake the house by singing the Power Rangers theme song",
            "I have no issue to be fair, I do think it\u2019s a completely healthy part of childhood. But I just don\u2019t want to become reliant on it, for my sake as much as his. \n\nIt\u2019s the kids crack TV I try to avoid, but he\u2019s caught onto the Paw Patrols and Spidey and friends\u2026 \n\nHe watches TV at some point pretty much every day, but typically around 4pm when he\u2019s getting tired. Gives him that boost until bedtime and prevents him pinging toy lobsters off the windows. \n\nThe judgements more so that it sounds like we got up and I chucked the TV straight on so I can post this \ud83d\ude02.",
            "Bluey and Star Wars? For real life?\n\nYou should come over to our house and I can be Bandit and you can be Fido and we can talk about how I've probably watched too many episodes of Bluey!\n\n\ud83d\ude05",
            "Rebels \ud83d\ude0d= quality time",
            "7pm before my teenager surfaced the other day! And then only because I shouted him for dinner.",
            "I was just thinking this. I was very much a 24 hour person as a child. I didn't go to sleep until early hours and was always up by 4am.  As an adult, mornings are not something I see much of unless I've not yet gone to bed. Team night people for me.",
            "Oh sorry, I didn't mean in general, I was thinking of the long term 4 hours plus parents.  You carry on doing a grand job!",
            "Just give him an orange and tell him it's a special type of apple.",
            "So I always thought it was 'crude', but it came up in conversation a while ago and a friend insisted it was 'rude'. I did my best to find evidence to prove it was 'crude' but couldn't, and I can't now, either. But I'm certain it was, and surely 5 year old me wouldn't have known the word 'crude'. \n\nAnyway, good choice. I was split between Leonardo and Michaelangelo.",
            "Up there with the octopus that has eight testicles. (According to my little sister, many years ago.)",
            "It\u2019s the best way to raise them actually",
            "Other people probably will though, and might take the information \"All tortoises are turtles\" to mean that the animals are identical\u00a0",
            "Name checks out",
            "Without him, that firestation would have closed years ago.",
            "The sort of blokes who'll clear up any mystery.",
            "I thought those were the thunderbirds.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Thundercats went thunder thunder thunder thunder cats HOOOOOOO\n\n\nEdit: what the thunderdog do?",
            "My sisters still don\u2019t believe me when I tell them about Samurai Pizza Cats",
            "Trans word sport.  Memories.",
            "You can only keep him away from that stuff until he starts nursery and all his friends are watching it anyway,\n\nSee also: mate\u2019s daughter, raised in a no gender-roles, Montessori and sad beige Scandinavian wooden toy household, starts school and is now the biggest brightly coloured plastic Disney Princess fan imaginable.",
            "I'll just wait for my toes to uncurl from the cringe and I'll walk right over...",
            "Ah, sorry! I misinterpreted!",
            "Alright well you have fun navigating the imaginary scenarios in your head.",
            "\ud83d\ude02",
            "Oh my, FIREMAN SAM IS BUILT ON A THRONE OF LIES! It\u2019s a conspiracy between Dilys, Sam and Trevor!",
            "Family introduced him to Paw Patrol about a year ago, we\u2019ve weaned him off that but he\u2019s now a bit obsessed with Spider-Man. \n\nWhat I will credit Spider-Man with (specifically \u2018Spidey and his friends\u2019), I think it\u2019s contributed to making him so sociable. Me and his mum aren\u2019t the most sociable, but he is freakishly capable socially.",
            "It's just monkeys singing songs.",
            "https://www.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/comments/9khzt3/to_help_a_turtle/\n\n\nThere's no reason to not call a tortoise a tortoise, and it's just pedantry to say \"all tortoises are turtles\". Yes it's technically true, but why be a dick about it",
            "Kids' telly is a tool as much as much as anything, never beat yourself up about it. \n\nWhen my son was two we were deep into lockdowns when there was only so much you could actually do without losing your mind. \n\nI'd actually credit Duggee and Bluey with helping him learn how to socialise better with other kids, he'd have become too much of a smartarse otherwise only being able to speak to adults.",
            "Mate I\u2019m responding to a thread about whether cartoon turtles are turtles or tortoises and you\u2019ve got a problem with pedantry."
