AI degrees are also offered by the CSE department.\n\nAnother thing is connectivity, as an undergrad it helps to be able to be well connected to home.

I didn\u2019t get any call, let alone be many, in last 3 years, but this year was an exception. \n\nMany students do not opt for placements and go for research or off campus but that percentage is hardly 20% but there has been significant jump this year in non placed students this placement season. \n\nMarket situation is notably a problem right now.

They are getting things at way less marks that a general male is getting at double their marks, then obviously they don't know the real price of hardwork.
