            "\"...we don't want anyone to stress...\" \n\n\"...skip out on sleep or develop anxiety...\"\n\nThat ship has sailed.\n\nNot for the plot just in general lol and Neopets certainly isn't gonna make it worse.",
            "Honestly, I really appreciate this because I felt at the time, the Tale of Woe plot zipped by so fast because I was working and had classes and by the time I got home all I wanted to do was eat, sleep, homework and shower (not in that order).\n\nAnd the Atlas of the Ancients? I have a trophy but felt like I hardly participated at all. \n\nI like the slow pace because sometimes I just do dailies, feed pets, and the daily quest stuff.",
            "This is a good thing and more specifically TNT straight out addressing it is an even better thing. More visibility on tnt's decisions is a great move and I hope they continue down this path!",
            "I understand the sentiment but the snail pace drip feed isn't the way. Instead I'd like to see a big chunk get released then give us a month to work through it at our own pace with an announcement saying the second part will drop at the end of the month with extra rewards for people that finish part one by that date.",
            "They admit that most players are adults, but I still can't say crack on the neoboards",
            "Totally get their sentiment and really glad they're considering real life when factoring in how this all works and prizes and such. But even with that logic of someone only having time to play on Sunday and needing to catch up on everything released that week--It's two incredibly short comics and a text box. It will take a person 3 seconds to catch up. It's entirely too slow of a start. They've been building hype for this for an entire year now. They hyped up the start of it saying JUNE 17TH IT OFFICIALLY STARTS for it to just be more sitting around waiting while being drip fed even more intro story.",
            "Every time they use the NF page for something like this, I am pleasantly surprised",
            "They know how anxious millennials are omg this is so thoughtful",
            "I wish they would release at least more than one page at a time if they are going to do a relaxed pace.",
            "I appreciate that they aren\u2019t trying to make us cram or grind like crazy but I think the issue is with the wording on the event page. \n\nClearing up when things will be available, how often, or even an estimated timeframe, would probably alleviate most confusion.",
            "I get what they mean and I appreciate the sentiment...but it feels weird that this was so hyped up and now I'm just bored waiting for another update, idk.",
            "Why not have a schedule?\n\nOr a weekly release?\n\nSetting up expectations is important to not confused everyone",
            "I love this. As an adult with a full time job and a baby and planning my own wedding like three weeks away, I love this. I LOVE games that value my time.",
            "I like it, but where is this mentality when the Altador Cup rolls around? Cause like that is something that begs to have ALL your free time each day.",
            "This is helpful because I missed a elderly paint brush because my toddler wouldn\u2019t go to sleep until 2 am and I couldn\u2019t play that day",
            "I'll be honest I have mixed feelings on this.\n\nOn one hand I really adore that they are keeping in mind that people might not have a chance to log in but once a week. I know it's been an issue with a few of the things like the festivals that people end up missing a day and often not even realizing it or just not getting the chance because life. It's also fantastic to see that they fully acknowledge that their user base is primarily adults.\n\nOn the other hand if I'm getting literally 0.5 seconds worth of anything to do every 3 days I'm gonna really really lose interest. Especially right now where it's just a few comic pages that would take 3 seconds to read all of, if that. If you are so busy of a person that you need a week to read 4 seconds worth of comics you need to probably sit down with a professional and help you readjust your life scheduling because you're gonna burn out in months.\n\nI think it would have just been an overall better idea to just let there still be real time events when we get there, but everything that isn't real time you can do when you want to with zero penalty. If you wait 4 months to even click, then catch it all up in a couple days and start participating in the battle, then you can still get the same prizes as if you log in every day and add it onto your dailies. You just get the benefit of being able to participate in the community if you do it in real time.\n\nI wasn't logging in anyway as much because dailies are getting boringly repetitive so I was hoping the plot would incentivize me to log in daily again but honestly I'm far less interested if I only have the content that spans the time it takes to load a single webpage.\n\nOn top of that, saying this but having no indication when the next stuff is gonna drop despite there being supposedly multiple things to do in the first week still causes everyone to log in frantically waiting for whatever tasks are supposed to be completed.\n\nThis is massively in the right direction but I do feel it could be adjusted a bit still.",
            "Wow this is actually pretty thoughtful.",
            "I really do appreciate them taking into consideration that we're busy adults. I didn't get the Gold trophy from the last Faerie Festival because I missed one day and I am still mad about it lol",
            "i am so glad they acknowledged i'm adult, now if they can change restocking for rare items to reflect that, i'd be happy.",
            "Im actually really happy they made this update and took time to consider what their current userbase is doing nowadays. I made my first ever account in 2003, when I was 8. Played Neopets in periods of time after that, but always (especially as a kid/teen/young adult) had trouble with keeping up with plots or other things. I also missed some plots and other festivities in the last few years, just because life was catching up with me and I had other things  to tend to.  \nI've been more active for the last few weeks because of sick leave and was actually STRESSED because of this plot because I was so scared I would miss a lot of things. But seeing this is actually nice and thoughtful!",
            "Love it. I hate missing a day from work and whatnot.",
            "Okay but they need to specifically spell out \u201cwe will tell you everything you need to do to earn each avatar/prize/trophy\u201d or my anxiety will not be sated LOL",
            "I actually like this \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb",
            "This is very considerate of them, I\u2019m glad to see them taking adult players (which let\u2019s be real, is probably most players) into consideration",
            "Appreciate it! but also a heads up woulda been neat. lol.",
            "They need to keep this energy for Altador cup as well or I\u2019m not doing it this year. I don\u2019t want to waste half my day everyday for a month just to get a good prize",
            "I appreciate both the sentiment and the announcement. I'm one of those players who struggled to do dailies because of work. As it is, my dailies are narrowly curated into a slim selection of necessities and I have a bunch of stuff I only do on weekends. Not having major tasks to log in and do every day is nice. The announcement is also reassuring. Because of my play style I was worried I was missing stuff I haven't heard about yet. I always kick myself when I miss a prize that is available while I'm actively playing (fully did this during wraith resurgence).",
            "I appreciate their consideration for those of us that aren\u2019t as active, but a year?! I don\u2019t have the patience for this",
            "If there\u2019s so much story why can\u2019t I have it now",
            "I like the philosophy, but they really need some small but very challenging rewards for people that have a lot of time and want to spend that on Neopets. Basically, 90% of the plot should be at the pace they describe and 10% should be optional and only obtainable through great effort. They should also have repeatable, generic dailies out at this point (like bd opponents and the like) for more engagement.",
            "As someone who can't get online at the minute, this is a huge relief.",
            "Definitely love the new pacing but I have one question: I've gone through all the current pages and do have the 3 points. But my Rewards tab says my Act I is incomplete and have 0%. Is that correct or is it finicky on mobile? Or does that just mean I can't complete everything currently because they're still rolling things out?",
            " Beats the Mystery Island Plot where you have to be online at a specific hour to be within the first 5k to visit a link for an avatar.",
            "I\u2019m good with the catch up sentiment but surely a few more clicks/things to do wouldn\u2019t hurt right? lol",
            "This is so nice and cool of them haha they are looking out for us OG Neopians! \ud83d\ude0a This is cool haha yea Neopets!",
            "I...I love them. They CARE about us.",
            "I get why they had to say something, but the fact they *had* to say something because people are impatient... ://",
            "Yes i have a full time job and kid to look after before bed but i still get 5 mins at night to go on plot, no reason the plot should be this slooow",
            "so many other things are set up to punish you for not doing dailies & it formed an expectation.\n    \nI am very happy that they aren't having daily penalties, but it's gonna be an adjustment.  \n   \nIt's the right choice tho imo.  My fun internet game shouldn't punish me for having real life emergencies.   It's very \"drink verification can.\"",
            "That's exactly it! I wouldn't be so afraid to miss something if there were not literally a quest that launched day one about doing everything in the first week. It made me afraid like when will they consider the week over? What if an actual activity happens the day before the technical first week ends and I miss it?",
            "Yeah exactly ;; don't put a quest that says \"complete everything before the first week is done\" without any context if you don't want people confused x.x",
            "Exactly. They haven't given us anything to do but set the expectation that we need to do /something/. Or miss out on that quest. If they didn't want us to stress, they shouldn't have started the plot off like this.",
            "Yes this is what made me worried I was maybe missing something \ud83e\udd74",
            "Someone please tell me where the quest can be found?  I haven't seen it anywhere.",
            "It could just be tho that all they are referring to in the first week is reading the story, there\u2019s nothing (as far as I\u2019m aware) that specifies that there will be anything extra to do? Pls correct me if I am wrong tho!",
            "Those are considered a different type of Event even though they all appear under the same Trophy Section on the Lookup. Think Defenders of Neopia also shows up in that section.\n\nEdit: Oh DoN appears in the section below. My bad. \n\nA Plot where you can do most of the things at any time is less stress than the \"Oh, you missed a day so kiss that Stamp goodbye\" pace of a typical Annual Event.\n\nThe Prize Shop suggests that you don't need to do everything to qualify for the best prize, but you want to do as much as possible to get as many prizes as possible.",
            "Right? I came back to the site just before the faerie festival and was crushed to realize I missed out on certain rewards because even though I participated every day I had accidentally missed something that wasn't obvious like the main item turn-in. So I've been careful to check EVERY page of this every day, and seeing them make this statement now just feels laughable. They're the ones who trained people to feel that anxiety and never know if they're going to get blindsided by something that was easy to miss.",
            "To be fair, those events are not a 10 month long plot lol. Plots are always slow burn.",
            "Agree! I'm here for the transparency and the more relaxed timeline. It definitely eases my anxiety. I am lucky enough to have a schedule where I can always check in at least once daily, but I know that's not everyone's experience, and having limited free time is probably extra frustrating on traffic-heavy days when the site is slow.",
            "It's genuinely so awesome they accommodate to the mostly adult players \u263a\ufe0f",
            "YES \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb",
            "It's been a LONG time",
            "Basically this- you give me a very small window to do things in, but no way to tell what things are available to do! How can I even figure out if I'm missing anything before the Last Day of The Chapter warning?!",
            "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",
            "Ugghh the Lyra plot made me upset to learn there was a \"read every update on day of release\" achievement. I had every achievement except that one and missed the top prize weapon due to it :(",
            "Can't really blame them, given how ambiguous yet strict the requirements were on some prior plots; with the Spooky Food Eating Contest, even now the JN guide says \"exact requirements unknown\" for the final prizes/avatar.",
            "Agreed. I initially wasn't too concerned at the start because I figured it was the whole \"Day 1.5\" start we've had in other events such as the Festival of Neggs, but got a smidge worried when Thursday went by without any updates.",
            "Agreed! I've been wondering if the exceptionally slower burn with this start has a bit to do with the behind the scenes stuff going on with TnT right now, ie: Since mid June over the span of a few weeks they will have started this plot, refreshed the QL prize pool, and started up the Altador Cup. So as much as the slower slow burn to start has felt a bit off in relation to other plots, I think I can understand why that may be as well (on top of what was mentioned by them in their news post).",
            "LMAO I feel you",
            "Hm, I thought people were overreacting (Not uncommon with Adult Neopians) but I can see how many people would be concerned about missing something when it's really just one page every other day. \n\nPeople were conditioned to expect more right off the bat.",
            "Completely agree. a single page 4-6 panel comic with 5 total words takes literal seconds to look at. I can read a 50 panel webtoon in a few minutes. I can understand the reasoning for giving more time for *actual* content to interact with like collecting those 50 void essence eventually.\n\nLaunch day should have been multiple pages of comic leading up to the second update being the leaked conversation with like a week to gather these void essence.\n\nBut also, there will *always* be the players who absolutely binge rush through the content as quickly as possible as soon as it is released and then complain that there's no new content These are not the players that should be dictating the pace for everyone.",
            "Babe it's literally week one. You have no idea what the future steps actually include. \n\nYou can't judge the entire plot over the literal first comics where no steps/bd/hospital events have been introduced yet.\n\nThis is a great way for TNT to still appease us who actually work fulltime and CAN only play a couple hours a week. This is hype AF for me.",
            "I'm sorry but this is literally how every plot has been in the history of forever\n\nIt's hyped up and it's a slow burn, this is literally the first week of a ten MONTH long plot, of course there's nothing to do? People are going to be grateful for the pacing when the battle portion comes out and you have to kill 100 of each enemy or something crazy",
            "Because they'd miss all of their own deadlines \ud83d\ude05 That's been the track record so far.",
            "Also - so just check on sunday and do the catchup? I like it.",
            "I never do Altador cup \ud83d\ude05 The amount of time spent on games I don\u2019t enjoy is just never worth it for me.",
            "people aren\u2019t being impatient, it\u2019s literally the opposite. people wanted the plot to go slow so they don\u2019t miss out on things.",
            "Yep, even as a kid I was like \"what the fuck?!\" sometimes lmao",
            "Go to the Void within page and click \u201crewards\u201d. It\u2019s listed under \u201cfearless deeds\u201d",
            "It says gather 50 void essences so unless you know where to find those, people are gonna panic they haven't done everything they were supposed to",
            "I think that's why they're being SO slow right now.  To force people to adjust their expectations.",
            "Yeah, I was sad when I couldn't join Team Illusen because I missed the first day (I got randomly assigned to Team Jhudora) and then devastated when it meant I couldn't get Illusens Staff despite having enough points for it.",
            "In previous plots reading everything was completely optional so the requirement threw players off. \n\nDidn't help that the story itself was bad. Walls of text. Generic characters. Poor art. A boring story. And an outcome that was mostly unaffected by the player's actions. Not something players wanted to read more of. \n\nAnother thing that got folks peeved was that the plot happened *over the holidays*; a time when players were most likely to be away from their computers for one reason (visiting family) or another (workers tend to burn off time they can't carry over into the New Year in December).",
            "I haven't done a plot since maybe Moltara so it seemed pretty on-par to me, but I'm clearly out of the loop.",
            "What did it for me was the quest to \"complete everything there is to do before the first week ends\" - the way it was phrased made me freak out a little because it sounded like there was gonna be something to actually *do* within that time frame (reading the comics up to now felt more like being a spectator than actually *doing* something) and that I was missing it ;-;",
            "\u2026gather what void essence?\n\nI\u2019m probably the type of person they\u2019re catering to - I usually can only get on for about 5 to 10 minutes right before midnight NST, and I\u2019m busy trying to get my daily quests done in that time. I definitely missed the conversation, and didn\u2019t even know that you had to tap on the various comic panels to get it to progress and give you the button to collect the prize for each day. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
            "I think it's good to get this inevitable adjustment period out of the way sooner.  Let everyone flip out now, set expectations for the timeline, and then move forward.",
            "I don't think anyone is judging it, just a little surprised is all. I've never participated in a plot before, but every recent holiday has had tons of information on the daily (to the point where I glazed over most of the negg fest ngl), so it was surprising to get 1 comic every other day. Not bad necessarily, but unexpected given how heavily they've been hyping this",
            "Right? I\u2019m glad they are slowing down things. I\u2019m relieved because I\u2019m also getting a tad bored of the dailies on neopets and have skipped up to a week when busy",
            "I just remembered why I couldn\u2019t finish plots as a kid! I always got grounded from my computer! omg",

            "[removed]",
            "I vaguely recall most of the initial days of previous plots had more to the story than a 1 page comic with a few panels and little to no text, but then again TnT has released plenty of teasers over the last like 8 months to sort of layout the story a bit so maybe that's also why it feels a bit different too?\n\nI also think that we're all out of the loop and sort of in newer territory, even those who never took a hiatus, because this is a different TnT after all. So even though we can glean certain things from the past, that really only goes so far with new people with a different plan / vision running things. The excitement, however, that never seems to change \ud83d\ude01",
            "don't worry, the conversation and void essence I'm talking about are for a future update that leaked early. It technically hasn't happened yet, it's just floating around in a google doc somewhere. If you've read the comic pages, claimed the rewards, and have 3 plot points you're currently caught up!\n\n  \nAlso making the comics \"tap/click each panel to progress\" is very shit design in 2024 when this is largely going to be viewed on mobile.
