There are a number of executives who haven't even officially quit yet, but no longer have any direct reports or any responsibilities.

Which are most only found in mobile games. That's why Unity is an $8 billion company.",

Because Unity does make a lot of indie style example games.\n\nBut honestly if that is what you want from a engine then just use Unreal, it exists, doesn't make sense to turn Unity into Unreal when Unreal is an existing engine with more developer friendly terms than Unity.\n\nPersonally I use Unity because it is indie friendly, and Unity is that way because they don't make AAA games and I personally hope that in the future Unity will continue to make indie games their focus. Would I like if they made a indie game, published it, then made the source project available, sure. But I don't think Unity should chase Unreal. Many developers don't use Unreal.",
            "What a dumb take. \"10,000 times more in budget\". What does that have to do with how dominant Unity is? \n\nMore than half of games coming out are made with Unity. Thousands of games. The last few months alone included huge hits like No Rest for the Wicked or Prince of Persia Lost Crown. Heck, Vampire Survivors alone is several magnitudes bigger than that game you linked. If you look at the top 1000 best selling games on PC I bet more than half are made with Unity.",

I agree that Unity should focus on being the best engines for small studios.",

            ">little toy projects that could never scale to an actual game.\n\nWhat is an \"actual game\" to you? Is it even something that can be made by indie developers? Because Unity has provided many samples of games, even a nearly completed Opensource game to learn from. Unity also provides the most detailed documents out of any engine, and they provide the most learning recourses.\n\n>\u00a0there is no comparison in effort or approach between a game and a little toy prototype.\n\nSure but how much of that is the engines responsibility? Is Unity suppose to do everything, maybe make a game in every genre then publish it to the store so everyone can make asset flips?\n\nI mean the Unity pro fee is less $200 how much of a game would you develop for someone if they told you that they will pay you less than minimum wage per month? Wait no, Unity gives it's learning resources and manual for free.\n\nAll I am asking when is it time for the developer to put in their effort? Or is it that Unity should instead focus on AI or some other tool that will just save developers from doing their part.",
            "You started babbling about revenue when sales usually refers to units sold. You can't even get your own argument right.",
            "Maybe business talks is not the right topic with you. Unity or Epic Games as a engine maker business, they get revenue through license sales (both unity or epic has other businesses as well, but that is not a topic here).\n\nSo for PC market share, if you want to calculate it, you need to calculate how much license sale/revenue that they can make per game title that uses the engine. 10.000 indie game only has less than 10% of titles that make more than 100k (this is the milestone where you need to pay Unity). One triple A game alone, with 5% of their game's revenue going into Epic games as a license's revenue can easily outnumber license sales from Unity for 10.000 indie games.\n\nThis is why Unity does not dominate the pc market share, compare to the mobile market, where there are a lot of gacha games made by Unity, that generate a lot of license sales for Unity since the game developers make a lot of money.\n\nOne last thing here, since you never care to learn the actual definition of business word, sales do not refer to unit sold. Sales in general can be roughly viewed as revenue. In short, sales != unit sales.",
            "The conversation was never about Unity or Epic games as companies or how well they do financially. This entire discussion was about who has the biggest market share on PC/Steam in terms of users of games made with their engines.\n\nBringing in the revenue the companies behind said engines gross is completely irrelevant to that."

            "Yeah we all like Major Nelson but its never been super clear what he contributes besides being a hype man. I will say he's had good commentary on the gaming industry since leaving microsoft so it seems like hes got the right ideas but like I said idk if theyre paying him to take his advice on the direction of the engine.",
            "I used to listen to Major Nelson way back in the mid 2000s and enjoyed his Xbox coverage.  I can see him being a good fit for Unity, provided Unity really steps up in a major way.  I say this as the value of their engine right now as compared to the free open source options is more or less the same for flat screen games and even XR soon with Meta currently working on extending their XR SDK to Godot.  If Unity seriously delivers features and functions that speed up and make my development easier and justifies their fees, then I am ready to listen to Major Nelson again, but if Unity is going to continue to milk their engine while not being better than free options then I am moving to Godot as soon as the XR SDKs are available.  It is in your court Unity and slick marketing is not what will keep me in your engine.  I wish Larry all the best at Unity.",

I doubt we'll be seeing more insane runtime fees trying to cover the cost of 5k employees with undefined jobs or futures. This is an improvement over the nonsensical decay we've been seeing within Unity the past several years. And you can't say this guy isn't willing to take the heat and have direct conversations with people, it takes some balls to let a YouTuber like Angry Joe unload on you with neckbeard fervor. Larry is a real one and you can tell from this interview he takes pride in his job, his company and will take the heat to stand up for those things.\n\nBetween all these picks for top roles of late and so much positive gains happening with Unity 6, getting a lot of confidence back for the future of this company.

One thing that I do know is that he seemed to always be someone who was down to earth with gamers in general and those that met with him personally had good things to say.  So, fingers crossed.",

It's been a great learning experience.  That said, the bad Unity decisions really left us questioning what the future of our gaming development would look like.  We are all hoping that things improve and better decisions are made.  I hope you can help bring about that change.  The fact that you are responding to this thread gives me a lot more hope.

The main question will be why they would want to acquire unity? And it can be simple. They need to have new good games that sell, not only have the property of big ips. And maybe the fast, secure, and promising way to achieve this is having the property of the engine that can make literally any game in the market. \n\nAnd this can be really good or really bad, it can be good in the way that if it happens it means that it's the last chance of Xbox to have financial success. So that means that they will make all good with their fucking brains to not shit on unity.

            "They have an image (and trust) problem right now, so this makes a lot of sense.  They need to back it up with changes that make a positive impact on the developers and the gamers that play their games.  Let's hope they do that.  It will benefit the industry overall as well.",
            "I agree.  I think one creates the other.",
            "Are you really Larry?",
            "And corporate isn't a bad thing. This industry needs some old school sensibilities back before it implodes under the weight of its \"virtues\".",
            "Great to hear. Here's to that excitement turning things around, it's good to see more engagement from you guys out in the wilds.",
            "Thank you. Everyone I have met is committed to the users.  That\u2019s what attracted me to Unity. I\u2019ll do my best !",
            "Ye. I can't imagine why they'd want unity. \n\nAnd I think they'd be better served to use one of those instead. They have close to every genre within their game studio lists, with close to all having different propertery engines",
            "I can see a lot of reasons why Microsoft might want to buy Unity.  I remember all of the buzz about that being a possibility when \u00a0John Riccitiello was, thankfully, shown the door.  However, I think there will be a lot of legal hurdles (antitrust) for them to actually acquire it.  Maybe a deeper partnership?  I am not sure how that could work.  Maybe more Unity Cloud development with Azure?  Maybe partnering to expand their own store offerings to compete with Steam/Epic by making it easier to get games from the development stage into the Microsoft Store?",
            "Game jams are where people experiment. If it works, then people are more likely to use it in a professional context.",
            "I like to remember that Unity were the guys that essentially democratized game development. An engine with good support that was essentially free to use. They built their reputation on that, and it's the small, independent, and hobby developers that made Unity the household name it is (in gamedev households at least lol). Even today if you were to ask the question: what major/AAA games are made with Unity? It gets hard to answer after a few games and you start talking about games fewer and fewer people know. So where does that leave them? Not really hitting it in the big time, but alienating their core users? So is it industrial design now? Is it ads? I'm not sure even Unity knows the answer anymore, which is why I said they have an identity crisis. Godot on the other hand is welcoming in new devs with open arms. I'm hopeful for Unity 6 and just downloaded it last night to try a new project in. I'm especially keen to see if they've made web games less heavy as even their own research as highlighted the pivot to these types of games. We'll see.",
            "I've never used Godot and have always stuck with Unity, but where they were probably the engine for 80+% of games in a given jam, I think that number is trending closer to 50% now, which just means the spell Unity had on developers has been broken and people are now exploring the field.",
            "Yes. Yes I am.  Why?",
            "There are no anti-trust issues with Unity acquisition by Microsoft. There's at least one very large competitor (Epic Games, Unreal Engine) and several smaller ones, even Crytek could realistically be a competitor.",
            "XR",
            "There is definitely a trend away from Unity and particularly to Godot thanks to the major boneheaded decisions by Unity's management, all of the bad press, the jump by those who people follow (streamers, content creators, etc.).  Brackey's being a prominent one.  I think that, after a time, the negatives can be healed, but it will take effort.  Hopefully, this is a step towards that and not just trying to quickly put a bandaid on a bad situation.  Real change and honest dialog with developers and gamers need to happen.",
            "people have always been exploring ... \n\nand then always coming back \ud83e\udef4",
            "Oh wow, for me personally, it's good to have you on-board. I listened to your podcast back in the day and the way you engaged with the Xbox ecosystem and gamers as a whole was really nice, especially for someone so high up the ladder. \n\nMind if I ask, can you share any details on how you plan to engage with unity developers in your new role?",
            "I think the idea is that people would get worried after Microsoft bought a gaming development software that builds games for multiple types of platforms and how some favoritism of their own might get worked into it.  If Sony bought the Unreal Engine I could see similar concerns.",
            "100%. i like godot and I'm using godot for some current projects but to suggest that it's ready for all developers is a lie. it's better than Unity in some ways - specifically, I really like GDNative as a concept. i have friends who are using Rust in Godot and having very few issues, which is pretty cool.\n\nbut - the big issue I have with Godot isn't that it's missing features, but that it's so blindly in love with it's pure OO and tree based model that it absolutely kills your iteration time. for example - I wanted to add a Rigidbody which uses a box as a collision mesh\n\nUnity: right click -> 3D -> cube -> Add Component -> Rigidbody ->  Add Component -> Box Collider -> Done\n\nGodot: right click -> add node -> Rigidbody3D -> add child node -> CollisionShape3D -> add the shape to collision shape -> add new child node to RB -> add mesh instance -> add box mesh to mesh instance\n\nThese *might* sound similar but, the Godot workflow here is significantly longer - and, that's just... how you're expected to use the engine.\n\nUnity is also soo much better when it comes to building custom tooling, or extending the Editor - we like to dunk on UGUI / UI Toolkit existing at the same time, but, it is just... better.\n\nAs for game jams - Godot probably *is* better for game jams right now though - and that's just because GDScript having hot reload is very good for iteration time, whereas Unity is still stuck with Mono's slow domain reloading (until Unity finally moves to CoreCLR).\n\nFundamentally - my opinion is that Godot is a wonderful engine if you're a programmer who is really in love with OO, but, if you're not a programmer, or you want to delve outside of something the Node world can represent, you end up in a world of hurt.",
            "Yeah, makes sense. Happened with me. I tried Godot, but for what I wanted it was still too unstable. It corrupted my files after moving some resources 3 times! The first two I thought it was me, but now I'm just waiting for 4.3 stable to try it out again. Still a fun engine to use and toy around with, but I went back to using Unity for my larger, long term project, without regrets",
            "Not this time I'm afraid. Unity is in trouble with small/hobby/indie devs and I don't think it's an exceptionally popular engine in triple A either. So anyway the point is they have a bit of an identity crisis at the moment and need to figure out what they are offering to who. The move away from Unity, in my opinion, has never had at much momentum at it does now. Even Brackeys is pushing Godot. This is probably at least partially what's motivating the changes happening at Unity.",
            "It\u2019s a bit too early to tell. It\u2019s not a one size fits all approach. I need to poke around and see what\u2019s what first :)",
            "As someone that's getting into gamedev from software engineering, Godots work flow is very intuitive and clear.\n\nIt is unfair to say Godots workflow is significantly longer when it's about 3-5 seconds added. Compare that with the hot reload from script to run vs waiting, sometimes minutes, for changes in the script before you can use the editor in Unity and then you have a significant loss in time.\n\nI started my gamedev journey about 9 months ago and started with Unity. Loved it. But after using Godot for a while, it's just what works for me ATM (mostly cause I don't like clicking around so UE is not my cup of tea as I'll much rather use Blueprints than C++ with those compile times). Unity is great but Godot suit my needs better and seemed more intuitive to me (also it's age does show but with that comes less distractions with multiple things I don't need)",
            "Brakeys is nothing man \ud83d\udc80 ... it is honestly cringe to see so many developers and influencers ENABLE this in their audiences, not for the good of godot or gaming, but for themselves to have a drama to talk about and having a purpose in \"fighting the good fight agaknst the corporations\" for a while ...\n\nyou know ... the same evil corporation that gave jobs to the very people now complaining and going to Unreal ...\n\nthink what you will ... but by services offered, and C-written source code performance and compatibility, nothing beat Unity.\n\nand that is not changing, given how many rich people have stocks and investments that use Unity to function, both for entertainment and for State/Education even",
            "Those 3-5 seconds add up though - and, while yes GDScript has hot reload, all the other languages will still have compile time - and, Godot's C# support has a known issue where the assembly will sometimes just... fail to reload - and the UX is you just get linked to [this Github Issue](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/78513) - and then you have to restart the entire Editor. The current Godot workflow (at least for me) is significantly sower than Godot.",
            "This is fixed in 4.3. I use 4.3 beta and this problem doesn't exist anymore",
            "oh my god,,,, it's been 84 years dot gif\n\nbut seriously, that's fantastic news!"

If I can suggest something then I\u2019d say that you can stylize a few more elements to make the overall look more consistent and it can really be artistically unique. Imo the light beams and the starship materials could use some styling. Maybe go for an outline for more edges in starships and maybe add a little cel shading to them or simply make their material more matte, so they will look more detailed in close up. The light beams would be very appealing if they were more consistent with light beams from the sun in the background. Good luck with the game :)",

            "You don't have to use all of wind momentum to push boat. With correct angle sails can get some energy pushing them forward by wind coming from nearly front of boat. These were usually zig zagging against the wind so in a way... Yes they can. \n I believe in your case gpt would be great starting point towards starting research to get few references.",
            "I don\u2019t know how the square sails do it, but the triangular sails when viewed from above work similarly to a plane\u2019s wing. The sail is curved when filled with a breeze, and the shore resembles an airfoil. The wind passes over the leading edge and some goes \u2018above\u2019 (we\u2019re still visualizing it from above) and some goes below. The sail surface forms a high pressure underneath and lower pressure above, and the wind passes the trailing edge angled down. This \u2018Bernoulli effect\u2019 pushes the sail \u2018up\u2019 (like an airplane wing generates lift) \n\nThe key difference to the similarity to an airplane is a boat\u2019s hull has a keel. Otherwise the wind would be pushing the boat backward. \n\nWith the keel at an angle to the \u2018wing\u2019(sail), the boat instead travels in the path of least resistance. Which is forward, against the wind, but at an angle. \n\nWhat angle? Different geometries behave differently, but 45 degrees is probably a good approximation.\n\nhttps://letstalkscience.ca/sites/default/files/styles/width_800px/public/2021-11/action_reaction_lift.png?itok=GGMWQjBf\n\nhttp://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/sailing.html",
            "The cloth physics are nice. Is that your own or a plugin? if yours did you use verlet integration?",
            "As far as I'm aware, ancient ships didn't have the right sails or keel to 'tack' into the wind and so relied on rowing oars when heading into wind.",
            "Jibe ho!",
            "it depends how \"sim\" you want to go with it. \n\nSea of thieves doesn't really sim much, the game tracks a wind direction, sail angle and how opened the sail is, and the game makes a clamped speed calculation based on that. Wind speed doesn't change, the direction shifts a small amount constantly, the ships have different max speeds in different kinds of wind direction, and the ship just moves at its set speed based on the calculation. The game also allows the ship to move slowly upwind but tacking can be more effective, especially with the medium ship, the Brig which goes fastest in a crosswind.\n\nOr you could go full sim and try to calculate the amount of push your sail configuration has, like Sailwind does, but this can be janky and might be a major hindrance in combat. The wrong configuration can make the ship impossible to control, add too big a sail to your ship and the thing might capsize from an errant crosswind",
            "You can't sail directly into the wind. You usually sail at 45 degrees, but that alone isn't enough as the wind will still push the boat sideways. You use the keel/centreboard to convert that to forward momentum. \n\nI feel like it would be very hard to replicate in unity, at least hard in my head lol. It could be faked fairly easily however.",
            "Exactly...in sailing, it's called tacking and would be difficult but possible to mimick.",
            "Indeed, many places have mentioned this kind of operation, but I didn't understand the physical principles behind it. It's impressive that ancient people could master such a skill.",
            "Thank you very much for your explanation and the materials you provided.",
            "Square sails don't do it. They are kites as opposed to wings, they do not generate lift. They can move some direction lateral to the wind, but not at all into it like the more modern rigging. Triangle sails can actually move faster than the wind.\u00a0",
            "Thanks. Initially, there was consideration for the cloth to implement a compute shader for GPU cloth calculations or to apply verlet integration on a mesh structure. However, I felt it seldom has the opportunity to collide with the physical world., especially considering there might be dozens of sails in the scene. The sails should not consume excessive GPU resources. In the end, I opted for baking basic physical effects combined with vertex shader swings for the detail. The rigging system, on the other hand, did utilize verlet integration.",
            "Thank you for your suggestion.",
            "Thank you, I have also researched the sail dynamics in \"Sea of Thieves.\" I have only seen the experiences summarized by players but have not found any official introductory materials, and I am troubled by this.",
            "Physics is just forces. If you can draw the arrows on a piece of paper and do the math you can draw the arrows in code and do the math",
            "Think of it like this. Wind is pushing. its excerting power on the sail. The path of least resistance for the air to pass around, is for the sail to go through in that way. and for the sail to move like that, the boat needs to go forward in that zig sag way because water has more resistance on the shape of the boat. If the boat was straight on, the wind would push it back.\n\nImagine you have a flat piece of card board at 30 or 45 degrees against a strong fan. And you are holding that board. the air is deflected according to the angle of the board. Well it also excerts an opposite force to the board. if you were on wheels that are angled, that opposite force would push you.\n\nancients weren't dumb. i mean they discovered most of the math, chemistry and physics we use today. They observed and checked to see what goes on.",
            "There's not much you can gain from lesson material when it comes to play, both styles are more about getting the feel of the ship and mechanics, learn by doing.   \nYou might be able to find something from developer conventions like GDC, Rare's staff have done a few talks there, but mainly about shaders and visuals from what I've seen."
