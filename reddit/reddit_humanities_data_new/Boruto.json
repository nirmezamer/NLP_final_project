            "Himawari did pretty good in her first real fight",
            "Himawari + Kurama is so lit. She really pulled out the Spiderman responsibility quote and then proceeded to punch the absolute shit out of Jura. Really hope her character continues to become a focus.\n\nBiggest concern right now is that Boruto is seemingly the only character in Konoha capable of not getting low diffed by the villains. Seems like there's gonna have to be some additional power-ups for the other characters, or else it's pretty much just gonna be Boruto vs. everybody from here on out.",
            "Nishi continuing to be included in the action despite being the most useless Jonin imaginable always cracks me up. He took one look at Hidari and shit his pants.\n\nAlso Hidari nonchalantly sticking his hand in his pocket to chidori Sarada from behind was cold af. He may not know who Sasuke is but he's still got the same aura.",
            "Jura saying he won\u2019t forget Shikadai\u2019s name has an eerie resemblance to enemies saying that to Shikamaru when he was younger.",
            "I know it's useless, but I think we can already say Hima is Kage level with one real fight in her entire ninja career lmao",
            "I\u2019m really glad destruction is playing a bigger role this time around. Himawari punching Jura through what seems like a shit ton of hills is a pretty neat way to show her power same with the giant explosion that came in the bijuu clash. \n\nHima\u2019s regeneration seems pretty insane, like from what I understand Jura shot a hole straight through her and she more or less healed it instantly. Same way she did with Inojin. \n\nAlso pretty good feat from Konohamura, I\u2019m surprised he was able to react at all, but he did and blocked the chidori. \n\nThe way Boruto was just a speedline when he flew past Delta and Kawaki was pretty crazy. \n\nI do wonder what we will get to see next chapter.",
            "Time to flying raijin straight to the ihop",
            "Cool chapter overall. \n\nIt looks like Himawari is beyond just a Jinchuriki, probably because Kurama actually reincarnated into her as opposed to being sealed. It almost seems like the two are one being. She's immediately attuned to using Kurama's chakra and abilities, dropping a Biju Bomb off the bat was dope. I definitely think she'll end up being the \"perfected\" jinchuriki as a way to get her towards the level of Boruto and Kawaki. \n\nSasuke's clone is interesting already. Its obvious he doesn't actually have the knowledge or necessarily the capabilities of Sasuke, but he can use Sasuke's attacks. Im wondering if the connection to Sarada is strictly about Sasuke's love for her, or if it has to do with \"perfecting \" his being a clone of Sasuke. I feel like it was very intentional that he only just learned the Sharingan is necessary to perform the Chidori effectively. \n\nKonohamaru having a Wind Style Rasengan variant in the form of a barrier was dope as hell. I hope he gets more. \n\nAnd it looks like Boruto is safely on track to becoming an allie to the Leaf again. Saving Himawari will be helpful, but showing up to save Sarada and likely fight Sasuke's clone is gonne be a big boost to his reputation in the village. Especially with Kawaki essentially AWOL.",
            "The size of that beast bomb explosion was insane",
            "Himawari is fun. \n\nJura and Hidari kind of not knowing what they want to do is expected. I didn't think that Hidari would say he doesn't know who he is and that he can't use Chidori correctly due to his eye, though that is an okay way to make somebody who should be as strong as end of Naruto Sasuke an opponent that can be fought by some very powerful teenagers. \n\n(Okay, they were also very powerful teenagers but the three year time skip wouldn't be enough for Sarada to be more powerful than every potential kage that wasn't Hashirama or Madara, and they were born with the potential to have an ability to suppress this stuff)",
            "Bro I got so hyped at the \"spiderman\" moment. Himawari basically saying \"with great power comes great responsibility\" at that moment. Plus it's also her showing her will of fucking fire! Can't wait for next few chapter where I'm wondering if Hima will finally learn the truth from her real brother, and they form a 3-man team with Boruto, Sarada, and Hima, and Sumire being the insider in the village.",
            "Hidari: don\u2019t interfere you stupid mfs, I only want the girl\n\nJura: I humbly request that you don\u2019t interfere, I only want the girl\n\nBoruto: one of you went for my sister and the other one for my gf. Pray that Kawaki doesn\u2019t come near or Momo will pull up and whoop your asses.",
            "\u201cIn this world there are kids younger than you yet stronger than me\u201d - Kakashi to Naruto\u00a0\n\nHimawari is officially the strongest Kunoichi in the franchise!",
            "Awesome chapters, just disappointed they handed Kawaki yet another L. Sure he's probably going to fight Jura, but I think it would have been a bit more 3D if he were the one to save Himawari, rather than Boruto writing wise.\n\nHimawari is epic though, can't wait to see her use KCM with Byakugan like the concept Kishi originally had for Boruto. \n\nFinally a cool reference regarding the requirement to use Sharingan to use Chidori, as well as literally answering the question \"what happens if a regular person uses Chidori\". Also the distinction that the standard Rinnegan's abilities are completely distinct from the Sharingan.\n\nI think Ikemoto made Hidari look a little bit more distinct from Sasuke this chapter (and with good reason, the only person who really noticed a resemblance was Sarada and Boruto).\n\nLastly, it's interesting that Jura knew of Naruto, and Hidari knew of Sarada despite never knowing them, but this chapter, when Hidari was asked about Sasuke, he didn't know the name.",
            "I was kinda surprised Himawari didn\u2019t use byakugan or any gentle fist techniques considering that\u2019s the way she was trained to fight. Hopefully we see a byakugan/nine tails fighting style at some point, imagine she uses her hair tails to do some crazy large rotation",
            "Copy-paste from the previous flubbed thread:\n\nHimawari did great all things considered and did better against Jura than Kawaki. Sarada and Sumire on the other hand got done dirty since they didn't even get to fight (even Sarada's counterattack was easily undone and noted as a fluke) and crumpled immediately from getting joy buzzered.",
            "so is himawari and kurama unaffected by omnipotty shit?",
            "-I like the cover page. Hidari does have a nice color scheme, and is refreshing to see yellow on an \"Uchiha\".\n\n--Kinda a shame that he, Jura, and the other 2 will all have the same standart purple Rinnegan though... it would have been cooler if those eyes too were all of a different color, like golden or green.\n\n-Good to see the \"is Inojin *really* going to die\" question answered immediately. No need for drama if the answer was no.\n\n-I like that Bijuudama clash, it had a really nice zoom out.\n\n-So Himawari is seemngly implied to be a bit more than a regular Jinchuuriki? At least via her regenrative abilities? I hope that it leads somewhere.\n\n-Good to see Konohamaru **not** getting beaten around and fin for once... he managed to stay up! And even used a new jutsu! Hurray!\n\n--It was only logical to have Hidari and Jura win their respective fights overall... people really need to learn to NOT overreact here, and act as if character x and y are useless or made irrelevant just because they do not win around.\n\n--As if the only thing that mattered was how much raw power one does have, not the actual in-universe role, like being targeted by someone, for whatever reason.\n\n--And for those who say that they wished to see her pulling off any move before \"losing\"... on one hand I get the point, but on the other... is what she did when the encounter actually began, in the previous chapter, non exsistent? Is she counter chidoring Hidari, lame, or irrelevant, in this idea of giving her anything even in a losing battle?\n\n--Lastly, if last chapter had people call Hidari a fraud just because he got hit by a chidori... then why having Sarada be hit here by someone that should still be leagues above her, be something bad? She wasn't even knocked out, and the encounter itself isn't actually over yet. What will people do if in the next chapter she will hit Hidari with a megaton punch for example?\n\n-Moving on, I like how Boruto came to the rescue, flying past Kawaki and depriving him of whatever (highly undeserved) hero moment he could have had, and also of whatever other L he could have got by facing Jura again (what a nice brother), and then proceeding to teleport around while holding his sister.",
            "Chapter is too lit !!!! Please make it weekly",
            "Nonstop cooking. Pancake edition this time.",
            "Boruto makes an effort to show people get burnt by fire jutsu it\u2019s a nice change although painful to imagine",
            "They need to release biweekly or make longer chapters, 7 months later and barely anything has happened",
            "Hima's hair reminds me of Kushina it's a possibility she might be able to control it very well cause of her genes this fight was good. I think it was a nice chapter. Hima did good.",
            "Inojin's hole is repaired.....buuuut now he has cancer",
            "I wonder what Code is doing during all this",
            "It\u2019s cool that Konohamaru looks up to Naruto and modeled his ninja career after him, but it\u2019s honestly disappointing that he didn\u2019t take after asuma and the third because the blueprint for him being such a cool unique ninja is right in front of him and it\u2019s such wasted potential",
            "So what happens if Hima cuts her hair? Maybe she grows chakra hair instead *ponders*.",
            "Naruto\u2019s kids are so cold bro wtf\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1s6qefj8tu7d1.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=0329b2c6aed86b064db0d69ddcadcda0244e2b29",
            "I'm doing a second reading now. Interesting that Sasuke's clone has Rennigan, but not Sharingan and that's how Sarada was able to win the Chidori duel. She can't actually match an Otsutsuki in raw power yet.\n\nHima is strong, but not Otsutsuki strong yet. Maybe like War arc level Naruto pre-Sage amp? She's already doing tailed beast bombs which took Naruto a while to master.\n\nThe scaling isn't completely bunk in Boruto yet. And Konohamaru did something! He invented a Rasengan variant and blocked a Chidori from Hidari who's probably a little below prime Sasuke.",
            "The hima vs jura fight gave me some major dbz vibes, pretty noice.. Pacing absolutely sucks but that\u2019s nothing new, same with boruto coming in to save sarada",
            "I feel bad for boruto at this point. Point must be exhausted of carrying everyone back to back",

            "whooa what a fun chapter tbh from the character moments w hima/chocho/jura to the excellent paneling \u00a0\n\n\u00a0Hima!!! wow but I have to imagine kurama is helping somewhat right?? V cool her display of power w out a sealed kurama they seem to be of more like one body even more so then Naruto w unsealed kurama (no chakra cloak w Hima)\u00a0Jura continues to intrigue me and grow on me as a character.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nKonohamaru new move was dope! A defensive wind style rasengan variant! (W the anime that\u2019s his second windstyle rasengan variation) poor sumire and other leaf ninja guy\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nSarada! Great art w her and really liking how Ikemoto is drawing her hair cut in motion. Higura is also really interesting\u2026his comments on the sharingan and sarada being the only thing he \u201cawoke\u201d w in his mind\u2026..plus his use of the claw marks is nasty\u00a0\n\nKawaki w deltas disrespect then borutos lol\u2026.BORUTO is the MVP!!!! saving hima AND sarada w in moments of each other!! Really hyped for what\u2019s next\u00a0",
            "Really good chapter I just wish it didn\u2019t come out the same day as the Elden ring DLC.",
            "Tsk, you are on borrowed time Inogin. BORROWED TIME! \n\nnice to see Boruto flex his big hero energy. Those hima and sarada rescues were down right swoon worthy. \n\nShikadai getting name recognition from 10 tails. Man, what a powerful family in their own way.\n\nI liked that Hima was losing. She's a tough cookie but these guys are beyond her ability even with kurama.\n\nNice to see Konohamaru try to be useful. Talk about borrowed time. \n\nWhere are the other adults? Like chogi and rock lee?",
            "Anyone hope Konohamaru would do that defensive Rasengan jutsu again soon just so Boruto could see it.\n  \n  I thought it would make a fantastic addition to Boruto's arsenal.",
            "These chapters are too short to be waiting a month \ud83e\udee0",
            "My only gripe this chapter is that Inojin should be dead. The dude got pierced by a massive pillar, he should have died instantly. If the author wanted him to live, he should have made the wound less severe so it would be believable that he survived long enough to be healed.",
            "So its pretty much confirmed that Jura is the tree clone of Ishiki. He used the black rods on Himawari. Didn't notice it at first because the rods were so small they were similar to nails in size.\n\nI was wondering what she was healing when Jura was talking about Himawari's healing ability then when I noticed the little dots so the nails went right through her.\n\nI feel like Jura can't use the rods the same way Hidari can't use Chidori.",

            "do yall think when boruto was using FR, symbol being specified to square was cuz boruto aint perfected jutsu yet so its easier for and its some kind of a downgrade or did boruto add something and upgraded it?",
            "MVP of the chapter is the guy who used doton after he saw Hidari use lightning release. Talk about being useful. Then, Hidari cooked.",
            "I don't see why everyone is complaining about this chapter. For me I kind of understand why Boruto ended up saving both Hima and Sarada. I mean Hima just started her training as a shinobi. While Sarada is powerful on her own you guys can't expect her to suddenly be able to take on these Ten Tail creatures. Unless she has knowledge of them first hand how do you expect for her to suddenly beat them. \n\nBecause I'm pretty sure up until now from Naruto series the main characters always got beaten first when they first met their enemies. Jiraiya wouldn't have died if that were the case. And Boruto ran away from them when he first encountered them. That's not what a Gary Stu would do. To be honest I doubt these people who called him Gary Stu even know what that means. Considering what kind of people lurk in here.\n\nAll in all I found this chapter enjoyable.",

I just love how well he is prepared using the toads and the markings, ftg and his other abilities.\n\n  \nim just totally hyped since the start of tbv",

            "So poorly written",
            "Not that she can be expectedvto know I guess, but Sarada's reaction to the chidori being her and Sasuke's jutsu (acting as if no one else can use it) brings Kakashi to mind and makes me think it's weird dialogue. I guess she is right about the present because Kakashi lost his Sharingan in the last war.",
            "It still baffles me how sarada can\u2019t make the connection of hidari being her father despite boruto telling her that he became a tree in order to protect him.",

            "Boruto kinda carried this chapter",
            "Not really sure how I feel about Himawari getting bijuudama that quick, but I did like some of the techniques used this chapter. \n\nUsing claw marks from your pockets? Neat. Rasengan made into a barrier? Also neat. Not a bad chapter overall.",

Just flew in there, grabbed his sister, teleported and saved Sarada. lmao\n\nAnd what does that mean, about Hima? Is she an actual Bijuu or something? It's more than being a host, but yet she has Kurama. So did Naruto pass on Kurama through DNA and THEN Hima was made host to (new) Kurama? Hope we get answers soon.",

She now has strength levels on par (higher) the most of the kage we've seen, but has no experience fighting, and would likely lose in a real battle, to a weaker opponent if it were someone with kakashi like experience. \nEx: Overwhelmingly more powerful than Itachi, but might lose to him.",
            "Shes a biju entirely. So safe to say she's above kage level. Just under Hashirama in terms of skill and strength.",
            "After her one fight I'd say we can scale her above kawaki as is and at least equal with boruto in potential",

            "I don't think he shot a hole in her, it looked like he grazed her as to damage her but not kill her. He wants to eat her after all and she needs to be alive if Boruto needing to be alive is anything to go off of.",
            "More like the waffle house at this point",
            "Also not only was he reincarnated into her but he is also immediately friendly, helpful, and cooperative with her which took Naruto years to win Kurama over like that. Each time Naruto gained the respect/admiration of Kurama, he gained a power up and/or more control over the tailed beast power. \n\nSo it seems like she basically got to skip all that and start out as a perfect Jinchuriki, probably mostly due to the fact that Naruto had already won him over and made him realize that people can be cool.",

            "> It looks like Himawari is beyond just a Jinchuriki, probably because Kurama actually reincarnated into her as opposed to being sealed. It almost seems like the two are one being. She's immediately attuned to using Kurama's chakra and abilities, dropping a Biju Bomb off the bat was dope. I definitely think she'll end up being the \"perfected\" jinchuriki as a way to get her towards the level of Boruto and Kawaki.\n\nMaybe that's the perk of Kurama not being sealed and therefore inhibited.",
            "Why do I get the impression that Konohamaru, Nishi and company are not going to see it as a good thing that Boruto is carrying Hima, the hokage's daughter they think he killed? They haven't seen Boruto saving Hima so it's likely that they think he's kidnapped her and that he's the one who's left her in that state.",

            "Maybe I\u2019ve always misinterpreted the rinnegan but I found it interesting that either A) the rinnegan is not the complete superior to the sharingan it was originally thought to be (my theory is to get a rinnegan that can process like a sharingan, you need a sharingan first. Just might not have seen that originally since most all rinnegan up till now came from uchiha with mangekyo) or B) they have an inferior rinnegan (see theory again)",
            "I dont think Boruto helping will do any difference to his reputation, at least in the long run. If I remember correctly, Boruto told Shikamaru after him realizing what was going on that the \"truth\" will always fade away and Omnipotence will override their thoughts again and again. Currently, it only really matters if Kawaki or Eida/Daemon think differently about the situation.",

Also, Himawari with that Tailed Beast bomb with her hair standing up like the nine tails was insane! Also, the people of Konoha are slowly starting to realize that Kawaki is a fraud. He can't save anyone or anything at the moment.",

Gentle fist disrupting Chakra could nerf the hell out of their healing factors.",
            "The information about rinnegan is most interesting to me. Is the only reason those who have had it in the past get that crazy perception and processing boost like a sharingan because of the fact they were all uchiha who already had a mangekyo before?",
            "That would be so cool!!\u00a0\n\nI wonder if she learned rasengan from Konohamaru over time skip?\u00a0",
            "I wonder if Himawari might unlock something like the Tenseigan in the future. I think that'd be extremely dope if it were to happen. At her level, Himawari is already comparable to Kawaki at the moment. She just lacks the fighting experience. Once she starts training, she's going to be busted.",
            "You just know she's going to use twin lion fists at some point, and it's going to be Kurama's face instead of the lions. If she learns Rasengan at some point it would be so funny, she's gonna be like the Ichigo of Naruto-verse.",

            "She'll be weaker than Naruto unless she gets sixpath senjutsu or toad senjutsu. Naruto was capable of extracting 100% out of Kurama and even then it still wasn't enough at times.",
            "Was it? Seeing that just felt empty. Naruto had to go through a fuck ton of shit before finally being able to do that. \n\nHimawari just immediately does it? That doesn't feel exciting. That just feels hollow. It was hype when naruto did it. Because he trained. We even saw him try to do it and fail. So seeing him eventually succeed made it hype.",
            "I could be wrong, but in og Naruto didn't Sasuke pierce through Naruto with a chidori, leaving a hole through him, that was completely healed by the nine tails chakra? People in this series have survived similar or worse injuries, so it's not that unreasonable.",
            "Jura literally called himself a Biju mate",

If you're not at a location then you don't know if something is happening. Having those toads around to provide information and assigning them shapes so he knows which to teleport to and when just seems like smarter usage.",

Now idk why they didn\u2019t just become like the other random claw soldiers Code made, but they evolved either way. Code didn\u2019t know this would happen, he wanted to make ten tails much more manageable. After all, 1000 average soldiers, all who he can use to transport between, are much more useful than a huge being who wouldn\u2019t even follow his commands. I will agree tho it seems like Code eventually took an L cus he can\u2019t control them anymore. But I really don\u2019t think that Code is anywhere near his strongest. My theory is that he awakens some form of Isshiki\u2019s powers too so that he can still be strong enough to at least pose a threat.",

They're likely (far) weaker, given that they are simply pieces of the juvenile Ten-Tails that Jigen kept as his pet, given sapience.\n\nMind you it took Isshiki (in Jigen's body) nearly everything he had to give to defeat Naruto and Sasuke, and even then the power was still killing Jigen.",
            "Despite that, it is a separate Dojutsu with its own abilities because it is not just the product of Indra's chakra but also Ashura's chakra as well. Rinnegan is still the eye of gods, it is not useless. Sasuke has both (Rinnegan and Sharingan) so he can still use Chidori.",

It will be the fighting/driving back the clones that make people want to trust Boruto, even with their misconception that he is an enemy.

It doesn\u2019t weaken his struggles and effort in the slightest, bro earned it and passed it on to the next.\n\nHimawari says it herself, basically quoting the \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d \n\nShe has what she has, and that\u2019s fine. What matters is what she does with it and she chose to take on a losing battle to save her friends.",
            "Ik how you feel but look at it this way: Naruto forcefully had 9 tails sealed into him. Whether it was by coincidence or just due to their chakras always mixing, he gained a good affinity for the 9 tails power and became a damn near perfect jinchuriki. Hima on the other hand had the 9 tails entire life force spontaneously arise in her. No seals, no use of force, and no initial resistance of Kurama to her either. As he states, her chakra also has the highest affinity to his ever. She isn\u2019t a jinchuriki, she\u2019s basically what Boruto is with momoshiki, 2 souls in one body with the full powers of both. Again, difference here is that Kurama is helping and completely allowing her to utilize his power. Think of it like his chakra is essentially hers, and that she\u2019s using it with a familiarity to the same way she\u2019d use her own. There\u2019s also a panel where I think she got injured in her stomach but the wound instantly healed. And as Jura said, that\u2019s not even what jinchuriki\u2019s do, it\u2019s like she\u2019s the tailed beast herself. Also, she still needs to train like Naruto did to control her power (and unlock greater power) and get stronger, that\u2019s why she would\u2019ve def lost that fight had Boruto not shown up so don\u2019t worry she hasn\u2019t mastered Kurama yet like Naruto did. But when she does, she will have a much greater arsenal than Naruto did himself",
            "I liked it. Himawari is not the normal type of jinchuriki, Kurama resurrected in her. That is why Jura acknowledges that she is more like them.\n\nIf the question is \"how can she do it?\" the answer is that Kurama already knew how to do it and was participating.",
            "My guy her affinity to nine tails is greater than Naruto\u2019s. She doesn\u2019t have to go through the process of befriending Kurama, he\u2019s already cooperating",
            "The chidori was a trike through the lung. The entry wound was the size of a fist. Inojin got pierced with a massive stone pillar that went though his entire torso. Also, the Naruto healing factor kicked in immediately because he was the jinchuriki while it took time for Himawari to get out and transfer the chakra to heal Inojin. Inojin should have died upon impact, it\u2019s not the kind of injury you can survive for a few minutes.",
            "Because atm it seems everyone else in Konoha is pretty useless compared to him. All he needed were those 3 pages to outshine pretty much everyone aside from Himawari",

The stakes built up in the previous chapter are gone now that Hima can just regenerate people.\n\nMuch like Naruto too once Kurama began collaborating (he kept Shikamaru alive despite the old Ten-Tails getting a bit of its hands on him if I recall right). Narrative wise, it's the same thing.\n\nAnd much like with Naruto, that too depends on how much chakra she can use.",
            "Well because they aren\u2019t just Code\u2019s chakra + 10 Tails. They\u2019re Code\u2019s chakra + 10 Tails + the chakra of whoever got absorbed",

It made the Akatsuki, an all their efforts and sacrifices, look like absolute clowns. Also, Sarada awakened the Mangekyou Sharingan without any significant trauma and without having to watch one of the people she loved die. Mitsuki and Dollar Tree Jiraiya have Perfect Sage mode without training, making; Naruto, Hashirama, Jiraiya and Orochimaru look like morons. Himawari is a better Jinchuuriki than Naruto instantly. Boruto can just train 2 years and become stronger than KCM2 S6OP Naruto + Rinnegan Sasuke combined.   \n  \nAnd so much more.  \n  \nIt reminds me of this scene on Dragon Ball Super where Caulifla [becomes Super Saiyan with zero effort](https://youtu.be/94eTPJ9IH58?t=53) because \"she's just more talented than everyone\" - making Vegeta, Goku, Trunks, Gohan, and everyone else who trained really hard to achieve this look like absolute clowns.

Chidori is pretty much unusable to non-Sharingan users because the speed the technique requires causes tunnel vision on the user making them vulnerable to attacks instead of landing their attack efficiently. The ability of the Sharingan enables the user to overcome this issues, perfecting their Chidori. Since the Rinnegan doesn't have the same abilities of the Sharingan, a user with both Rinnegan eyes can't perfect their Chidori. That is just a small sacrifice for gaining godly powers.

I agree with this as well, Naruto had a similar problem. That being said, id say this is that problem magnified because now it can be used on anybody.\n\nIt's still the same thing in all honesty (Naruto too could fundamentally heal / keep from dying everyone so long as he had enough chakra; with the only real exception happening when the old Ten-Tails went on a chakra absorbing rampage with its roots)... so the same problems apply.\n\nIf it is used seldomly, all is good.",

            "This is something I said when the manga leaks were out but\u00a0the reason why Hidari has issues with perception is because of his own speed and attack power that the Chidori outputs. [The Chidori](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cafa41f853ac22b3f1ca84b2d83518f0-lq) amps the user in Lightning Release making them [faster and stronger](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1ed0265668d11df589d22df5feacb46b-lq) than they were prior in order to pierce the target's defenses. However, without the ability to perceive your own amped speed and power, it is incomplete.\n\n\nSo to clarify.\n\n\nEven when Hidari's Chidori is objectively faster and stronger than Sarada's Chidori, he himself cannot perceive it to the best of his ability. He needs a Sharingan in order to see where he is attacking and how strong he is attacking.\n\n\nThe Rinnegan does not do this. The ability of the Rinnegan is to see chakra beyond the realm of space-time, and even manipulate or absorb chakra. Etc. It's function as a dojutsu works separately from the Sharingan. In general, the Rinnegan is not an evolution of the Sharingan because the Sharingan doesn't exist among the Otsutsuki. The Kekkei Mora is the Rinne-Sharingan and only Kaguya had access to it. (Kaguya may have possibly obtained this dojutsu by merging with the Shinju but that's a convo for another day).",
            "From what I remember, Orochimaru and Kabuto theorized that the Rinnegan is the evolution of the Sharingan and I too believe that but that doesn't mean it still would have the abilities of the Sharingan. When something evolves it is not always that all previous features are preserved. In this case it is due to a combination of Ashura and Indra's chakra. It is no more a type of Sharingan (Mangekyou, Eternal) like the evolution of Dojutsu from Indra's blood line instead it is a whole new Dojutsu evolved by a mix of both blood lines. During evolution an organism can be very different from previous ones, that is how we have diversity.\n\nI only gave the literal explanation but this doesn't contradict with any of the literal and metaphorical lore of the previous story.\n\nThe fact that the Shinju don't seem to constantly use Rinnegan abilities can be explained by the fact that they are just babies in their developmental stage. They learn quickly but still not there yet. They may need to devour some special people to accelerate their growth.\u00a0\n\nAnother thing is that different users of Rinnegan may have different abilities because it also depends on the user. That may be why you feel there are inconsistencies.",

But yeah, the discussion is just on this point. I\u2019m just wondering lore-wise, with actual explanations from characters or the author itself, and not from observation of us readers, what is the official version.

The only person Kawaki truly cares about is Naruto. Heartbroken, Eida undoes Omnipotence consciously or unconsciously to spite Kawaki.\n\nAfter these possible scenarios, Kawaki will have a MASSIVE Villainous Breakdown. He attempts to, or actually does, kill Eida for this. Whether he actually kills her or someone saves Eida is irrelevant. Kawaki will then release a massive attack that destroys the village. He then declares that nothing matters anymore. Everyone hates him and Naruto will likely hate him as well. Boruto and Himawari are the ones who try to sympathize with. But Kawaki will just state that the Era of Shinobi is over and this brings us to the prologue.",

            "I can see Kawaki either slip out once too many, thus causing people to inevitably abandon him; or believe to have killed Boruto, therefore his mission was done (eventual eradication of other threats not required), therefore he unseals Naruto and Hinata.\n\nHaving Eida grow tired of him would also be nice, but it shouldn't be the main factor behind Omnipotence blowing up in Kawaki's face.\n\n...\n\nHowever, since I'm not totally and absolutely against Kawaki (just mostly), I say that if Kishimoto wants to have him be redeemed in the end, then he ought to have Kawaki genuinely learn how to be a decent human being, and wanting to have bonds with people, this before Omnipotence is nullified therefore he is the one to lose everything this time around, and since it would mean something to him in this case, it would be a first step towards his eventual redemption.\n\nBecause it would make him start gain some sympathy points again, instead of just being a complete jerk.\n\n...\n\nAs for what may cause Omnipotence to actually be reversed... that's easy.\n\nJust have a strong enough being use Omnipotence to nullify the one casted by Eida.\n\nAfter all, for a power called **Omnipotence**, it'd be pretty ridiculous to have it be impossible to be reversed, even by another being from the one that used it the first time.",
            "Nahh Edias first use of omnipotence wasn\u2019t undone either and momo hinted that humanity\u2019s mind was prob altered in the past by kaguya too (makes sense given the narrative incongruities around her godhood going bad)\n\nShe gave us the solution and Boruto has already implemented twice; make new memories show them who u are. He did it w sasuke and seemingly mitsuiki\u00a0\n\nNow I do hope Naruto and Hima were unaffected Boruto doesn\u2019t deserve that\u00a0",
            "I think Kawaki will lose people's trust in him while Boruto will regain it like he is doing with Shikamaru, Mitsuki and Ino.\n\nWithout karma being undone, which will be a bigger hit to Kawaki's ego.",
            "Amado has managed to reverse engineer her \"charm\" ability, even not knowing what her power actually was. I think Amado has compelled her to love Kawaki the same way everyone else is compelled to her. Amado understands love is a seemingly unlimited source of motivation. and he will do anything to bring his daughter back. she is already starting to sense something is amiss, her and Mitsuki have a lot in common all the sudden.",
            "at first i liked the omnipotence, for narrative reasons, it put the characters to face a very new and hard problem, and i think that omnipotence should continue for a while, i agreed that it has to end but im not in a hurry, what bothers me is that the very little characters who were not affected by it, they are just weight, completely useless to the grand scheme, also, Sarada has been portrayed like a Damsel in distress and that is irritating, its like her sharingan is just excuse to use shidori and thats all, no genjutsu, no advanced taijutsu, not even an interesting ninjutsu, only chidori and fire balls, its like im seeing the chunnin exam again.\n\nFor the sake of the narrative, Boruto needs to \"turn\" more characters to his side while the Omnipotence is still active, kashin koji and those frogs wont be enough in the future.",
            "What if aida falling in love make her change reality like thats the reason she activated to help kawaki. Se let say she sees in boruto a mature man she likes and cast omnijutsu and return things to normal.",
            "I don't think that's possible. IIRC, she can't undo Omnipotence (stated in c1 of tbv)\u00a0",
            "What my line of thinking is, if Omnipotence did this monkey\u2019s paw business because of Kawaki\u2019s wish (that Boruto was an outsider so no one would care if Kawaki killed him), then does Kawaki have to be the one to undo it?\n\nOr, can Eida try to use Omnipotence again to undo what she did, if she wishes for it strong enough? I can buy a, \u201cOmipotence needs time to recharge,\u201d or she\u2019s still in too deep in her crush to really try to even attempt to undo Kawaki\u2019s wish. \n\nUltimately, I think it will be undone by one of these two, but not any time soon",
            "I like this theory, I'm not the only one who thinks kawaki will destroy the village because undone omnipotence would be a threat to naruto's safety as in unsealing him. Kawaki doesn't give a fuck about the village. Only that naruto gets to live. Even if naruto has to live a miserable existence.",
            "Going by the end of part one, Eida is starting to see Naruto's son in a different light and is sorry for what she did to Boruto.",
            "Omnipotence will most likely end up being undone in some sort of way. Considering the feel-good nature of Naruto's ending, im sure the same will happen in Boruto, like Naruto and Sasuke being unsealed/freed, Momoshiki unable to takeover Boruto at all, Kawaki forgiven/redeemed and so on. The effects of Omnipotence will likely remain for most TBV but will likely be reveresed towards the end of the series.\n\nI still think it would be cool to see an ending where the effects of Omnipotence remain and Boruto accepts the identity of *Boruto Otsutsuki* but with him regaining his reputation back and the perception of him by the village/people changing for the better as a shinobi of Konoha who fought to protect the planet against the God Trees and the person who freed Naruto and Hinata.",
            "I saw a video last year talking about how Nue comes from a Japanese folklore and it sacrificed itself to clear a \u201csickness\u201d. What if the \u201csickness\u201d in this case is false memories",
            "I think Kurama knows the truth, and we may come to find that it has more cracks than we believe, and may start breaking after time. Maybe after so many people start to realize the truth, it will start to break or things will get cloudy for people or maybe after xxx amount of years, people won't be able to look past things like the photos of Naruto with kid Boruto and just believing it's just a weird life glitch and will start to come to their senses by just using logic.\n\nWho knows, anime/manga logic is crazy, and I fucking love it.",
            "I\u2019m glad someone is talking about omnipotence. Idk about the rest of those theories mate \ud83d\ude02",
            "I'd like to see Eida get a training arc for it, just cause it sounds funny. \n\nJokes aside, she just needs to figure out how to actually control it. Most of the characters say that it isn't possible due to it being a godly ability in a human's body, but if it were actually possible, it'd solve all of her issues.",
            "Naruto would never hate him \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11",
            "Naruto would be incapable of hating Kawaki. Naruto may scold Kawaki but he is a character incapable of hating a person in his family. \ud83d\ude44",
            "I think it\u2019ll come back when the time is right. There are bonds that never left and there\u2019s bonds that might have to start anew.\n\nWhen the veil lifts though I think it\u2019ll probably be the moment Kawaki either goes ballistic, gets humbled, or both. \n\nIt could always end on the unsung hero note too.",
            "Why do I kinda feel it\u2019s not gonna end until the very end of boruto, like how at start of Shippuden we thought Naruto wud save Sasuke quickly but then it took the whole show for Sasuke to see the truth, and only at the end he was saved",
            "I doubt IT will be undone, but people realized that their memories were altered",
            "Nice copy-pasta",
            "Ik Momoshiki said it can\u2019t be undone but I simply don\u2019t believe him, if the power really is omnipotence why wouldn\u2019t it be able to overwrite or reverse itself. He was definitely trying to fuck with Boruto",
            "[deleted]",
            "I agree, I rather to have a BETTER BAD ENDING such as Boruto saved the world Konoha accepted him back but still not knowing that he is Naruto's son, rather than a GOOD ENDING such as reverse Omnipotence everything is back to normal.",
            "Edias and Kaguya didn\u2019t have any opposition and didn\u2019t want to undo Omnipotence. Eida or possibly another character is still a variable that could possibly undo the effects. Eida does feel bad about Boruto and this was done by accident. If something were to trigger her emotions and psychological state, like Kawaki not reciprocating her feelings harshly or falling for Boruto instead of Kawaki, she could potentially undo Omnipotence. And it would make sense that the thing that can undo Omnipotence is Omnipotence.",
            "Though even then it's wierd since those new memories will be ignored due to Omnipotence like Boruto told Shikamaru",
            "Amado is a scientist. He doesn\u2019t have any emotional connection to Naruto and Boruto. He\u2019s using a logical and scientific method to deduce what\u2019s going on with the Omnipotence.\n\nHe might even keep notes, journals, audio logs, etc. in case the Omnipotence is still trying to suppress his suspicions. If he decides to give his information to Shikamaru and others like Kakashi and Gaara, things might go Boruto\u2019s way as Kawaki\u2019s dream falls apart. This WILL somehow play a role into Omnipotence somehow becoming undone.",
            "I think she had a crush on Kawaki because she's a teenage girl. It's just that that crush had disastrous consequences.",
            "What if during the 3 year time skip, Boruto managed get allies who believed him like Sasuke did? I can definitely see Gaara, Shinki, and ESPECIALLY Killer Bee believing him and trying to help with everything.",
            "That is a possibility. Eida does legitimately feel bad for what she did. And despite Kawaki being recognized and as Naruto\u2019s biological son for 3 YEARS, he\u2019s still an antisocial jerk who treats everyone else like annoyances. If he ends up coldly and brutally rejecting her feelings, it could cause a breakdown for Eida and this results in Omnipotence being undone. Kawaki\u2019s own behavior becomes his downfall.",
            "Which makes no sense. Omnipotence is the ultimate power, and it should have the strength to undo what it has done.",
            "For plot reasons it will be undone somehow",
            "Okay, what if she uses it again and just swaps them back. Not undone, but fixed.",
            "If it can't do something then it's not omnipotence. The issue is control.",
            "I really do pray it\u2019s actually undone sooner rather later. If this ends up getting undone in 100 chapters from now, I won\u2019t be as satisfied if it\u2019s undone in like say 30 - 50 chapters from now.",
            "Kawaki\u2019s past experiences with horrible parental figures basically caused him to view Naruto as his God. The God that saved him from his misery and the God that will kill him for his sins. He doesn\u2019t view Naruto as a person with actual feelings.",
            "And with the stuff with Mitsuki recently. She might just be realizing that she loves the concept of love. The feelings she has towards Kawaki are just a mild infatuation and pity. But Kawaki shows that even with having 3 YEARS of people loving and believing him as Naruto\u2019s true son, he\u2019s still an antisocial apathetic jerk who only cares about fulfilling his quest and just views everyone else as annoyances.\n\nBoruto on the other hand has grown as a human being despite literally having nearly the ENTIRE world viewing him as a traitor and a monster. He understands the motivations of both Eida and Kawaki and wants to just knock some sense into his adoptive brother.\n\nThis could cause her to develop ACTUAL love for Boruto and try to find a way to reverse what she did. Whether or not she reverses it unconsciously or consciously is left to be seen. But I hope to see it sooner rather than later.",
            "I hope this Omnipotence stuff doesn\u2019t last for 100 chapters. It can last for at least 50 to 70 chapters. And I somehow get the feeling that we are going to get that feel-good ending stuff the original series got. But honestly, Kawaki DOESN\u2019T deserve a happy ending after what he did. \n\nHe tried to kill Boruto, locked his adoptive parents away for 3 years, causing them to miss 3 years of their friends and children\u2019s lives, brainwashed the whole world into believing he was Naruto\u2019s true son, still treated everyone like annoyances, and as shown in the prologue, DESTROYED Konoha. That is completely unacceptable and unforgivable. \n\nIf it\u2019s a more bittersweet stuff like Midoriya and Shigaraki in MHA, that\u2019ll be better.",
            "That would make sense. Though why would it wait 3 years for it to happen? Is it waiting for the moment that Eida finally falters with Omnipotence control?",
            "Isn\u2019t Nue anime only?",
            "There are already cracks in Omnipotence. But Kawaki will cause Eida to break it.",
            "Either way, this HAS to end. We saw the village was destroyed in the prologue. Kawaki\u2019s Omnipotence dream falling apart/becoming undone must\u2019ve been the catalyst to it. He basically snapped. That\u2019s what we saw in the prologue. Kawaki snapping and embracing his darker impulses and hatred.",
            "The \u014ctsutsuki clan were all sociopaths with god complexes. They didn\u2019t want to undo the Omnipotence they used. Eida is a human (cyborg) who has this godlike power. And she does legitimately feel bad for Boruto and only did Omnipotence accidentally out of her misguided love for Kawaki. If Kawaki coldly and brutally rejects her, this will cause a mental breakdown and Eida might unconsciously perform Omnipotence again to restore things to normal because of this. \n\nBasically like a backfire that puts out the first fire. And more poetically, Kawaki\u2019s own actions and behavior undoing his greatest desire: being loved and recognized as Naruto\u2019s son.",
            "*Sigh* I know. He\u2019s literally TOO nice for his own good. That\u2019s what caused this Omnipotence mess in the first place. He just couldn\u2019t see until it was too late that Kawaki was an unstable psychopath who didn\u2019t care about other people\u2019s feelings.\n\nI would love to see a fanfic that actually does have Naruto and Hinata giving Kawaki an \u201cI Have No Son/Reason You Suck Speech.\u201d",
            "I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just this Omnipotence stuff is aggravating me.",
            "He was just trying to demoralize Boruto so he could fully possess him. He knows there\u2019s way for Omnipotence to be reversed/cancelled. After all, his kind knows the move inside and out.",
            "Momoshiki cannot lie in their shared mind.\n\n\nWhat Momoshiki knew & thinks will be Boruto's knowledge.\n\n\nEven if Omnipotence is omnipotence neither Eida nor Boruto has qualified to use it properly.",
            ">Here's a little food for thought that omnipotence cannot be reversed simply like a genjutsu.\n\nThat panel of Momoshiki simply gives the idea that maybe Omnipotence may have been used in the past too.\n\nIt does not imply that it cannot be reversed, ever.\n\nAnd thinking about it, it'd be pretty weird to have a power called \"Omnipotence\", and yet it cannot be undone via another use of the same power... not even by a different caster",
            "It WILL be undone. Something in the Plot will cause this nonsense to end. I can\u2019t stand this.",
            ">I agree, I rather to have a BETTER BAD ENDING such as Boruto saved the world Konoha accepted him back but still not knowing that he is Naruto's son, rather than a GOOD ENDING such as reverse Omnipotence everything is back to normal.\n\nThat's not exactly my point though.\n\nI am the first one that wants Omnipotence to be reversed and have Boruto regain everything, simply because the story has painted the event as a complete injustice towards Boruto himself, so having him *not* accomplish what he set up to do at the end of part 1, which is to prove his actual identity to everyone, wouldn't feel good.\n\n...\n\nIn my comment here, I simply listed ways in which Kawaki could screw himself up (something *absolutely* deserved), and then a way in which Omnipotence could 100% be reversed.",
            "I mean they did a whole arc in the anime with a new member of kara, the whole thing was an elaborate mind game to play on people's emotions, he is a scientist and he fundamentally does t get love, loss, or emotions in general. But that's what makes him as big of a threat as the 'Sukis. Because he thinks it's just another variable to be controlled and accounted for.",
            "The stuff Mitsuki in the recent chapters seem to be confirming this. She\u2019s in love with the CONCEPT of love. She doesn\u2019t know what true love is. And Boruto\u2019s selflessness and growth as a person contrasting Kawaki remaining selfish and static might just cause her to self reflect. She might look further into Omnipotence and see if it is possible for the user to undo it. She did this by accident because she has the power even though she\u2019s not an \u014ctsutsuki.",
            "that would be nice to see, although i dont think gaara would be one, after all, he is a kage, who also is related to temari, who is the wife of the hidden leaf kage shikamaru, same dude who made boruto a hunted and renegade shinobi.\n\nAbout killer bee, it would be nice if the omnipotence does not affect jinchurikis, keep it mind that Kurama was dead and there were no jinchurikis on the hidden leaf when it all when to shit \n\nthe only allied i can see boruto having so far is orochimaru and his people, i don think it would be smart to go to other villages, that would, in a realistic scenary, shake the relationships among the villages/countries and that can develop into a 5 world war ninja.",
            "you need a God for that strength.\n\n\nOmnipotence proper usage requires things that Eida didn't have.",
            "Time travel to the point she casts it using that time turtle",
            "Exactly. Something in the Plot will cause this Omnipotence nonsense to end. And I hope it comes soon.",
            "That is possible. And it might be because her seeing Kawaki brutally rejecting her affections while Boruto became more selfless, understanding, and mature might just cause her to unconsciously use Omnipotence again to override the first time she did it. Like a backfire burning out the first fire. \n\nAnd again, Omnipotence showing the world the truth is what causes Kawaki to snap and destroy the village.",
            "She also said she wanted to have a long conversation with Brouto. She probably will fall for him.",
            "I agree with Kawaki not getting a happy ending either. I personally just believe Kishimoto is more likely to lean into the 'forgiveness and repentence' route similar to what he did with Sasuke. A bittersweet conclusion would be a good option as well.",
            "Well if He wasn't nice there would be no Sasuke or Gaara",
            "Exactly",
            "Momoshiki cannot lie to Boruto, they are one mind.\n\n\nIf Momoshiki knew shit Boruto will also knows.",
            "If that was really true that he couldn\u2019t lie and that he has complete access to Momoshiki\u2019s thoughts, Boruto would\u2019ve known what her ability was as soon as Momoshiki figured it out. At some point I\u2019m almost certain one of them or someone entirely different like Shibai, will have to the power to overwrite it.",
            "Damn I too tired",
            ">he is a scientist and he fundamentally does t get love, loss, or emotions in general.\n\nI think he at least knows the fundamentals of loss, given that Delta was his failed multiple attempts to bring his original daughter back, which did break him.",
            "Eida is a teenage girl who had a normal crush. And then once Kawaki started actually threatening her and being potentially violent, she pretty quickly loses interests. Her problem is, well, she's stuck. I'm just not sure how she can even study this ability.",
            "But since she\u2019s still a teenaged girl who doesn\u2019t truly know how to handle everything, her subconscious desires start to change. This affects the world as characters who were affected by Omnipotence start to question themselves and what\u2019s true and what isn\u2019t.",
            "The bittersweet ending would be better. Kawaki finally concedes that Boruto is right but he does know that the remaining \u014ctsutsuki (Momoshiki will likely be the last one) is still a threat. He ends up absorbing Momoshiki into himself and commits a Jutsu that kills both Momoshiki and himself. While everyone ends up praising and loving Boruto again and vilify Kawaki post-mortem, only the select few who knew the truth of Kawaki will mourn him.",
            "In this case though, Naruto forgiving Kawaki is just too much. Kawaki sealed him and Hinata for 3 years, told them he was going to kill their son, caused them to miss 3 years of the lives of their children, and the prologue shows he actually DESTROYED Konoha. Kawaki\u2019s actions are genuinely unacceptable and unforgivable.",
            "Momoshiki and the \u014ctsutsuki clan never wanted to undo Omnipotence because they\u2019re sociopaths with god complexes. Eida is a human (cyborg) who released this by accident due to her misguided love for Kawaki. And she legitimately feels bad for Boruto. It can be undone. Something just needs to happen for Eida to want everything back to normal.",
            "When Momoshiki figured Eida's Omnipotence he blanked his mind an hour or two untill Boruto busy pursued by others.",
            ">Damn I too tired\n\nYou're tired?\n\nIt appears so.",
            "he only understands it insofar as it has compelled him to incresingly desperate means, literally harnesing god level powers rather than admit his mistakes and accept his loss, he is deluded by his love for his daughter so much so he has abandoned all reason. he will destroy the world to prove himself and his ego right, that she is not beyond his reach.",
            "Something must happen. There might be ancient scrolls that detail Omnipotence\u2019s uses in prior events. Kawaki completely breaks her heart and therefore she breaks Omnipotence\u2019s spell. She did this by accident and maybe another tragic moment for her could cause her to unconsciously undo it again. \n\nAnd again it would make sense because if Kawaki is exposed as a liar, manipulator, and murderer; he\u2019ll snap. That\u2019s why the village was destroyed in the prologue.",
            "It's also worth noting, other than her brother and Kawaki, that she has never had a real connection with someone, Brouto puts her in an interesting place as he isn't someone who thinks of her as a tool like Kawaki, and if it wasn't for the fact that Daemon would kill Sarada and Class Rep it would be nice to be able to see her experience real friendship and how that would change her as a person.",
            "Did you forget what Sasuke and Gaara did",
            "If all it takes is blanking your mind, then it\u2019s not complete access. He could\u2019ve lied to Boruto then blanked his mind",
            "I mean, at this point, Kawaki doesn't even need to be exposed as a liar for just this. He just needs to do a ton of stupid shit.",
            "Sasuke and Gaara ATTEMPTED to destroy the village. Kawaki ACTUALLY did destroy the village in the prologue. And Kawaki basically destroyed the one thing that Naruto truly craved: his family.",
            "he blanked his mind because he cannot lie, otherwise it's unnecesarry he did that.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nMomoshiki cannot thinks & says different things because they are not actually talking to each other but overheard each other's mind.\n\n\nwe don't know yet whether Boruto can access past thought, so Boruto may miss if he didn't pay attention.\u00a0",
            "Still it\u2019d be IMMENSELY satisfying seeing everything he wanted from Omnipotence becoming undone and becoming the most hated person in the world again.",
            "I mean, it would sort of be satisfying even if it didn't. In some ways it would be even better!\n\nBut I also want this to have a happy ending.",
            "How so? You mean that Kawaki just being an antisocial apathetic jerk to everyone while Boruto remains kind and understanding to everyone would cause them to abandon him? I can see that. But I just want the truth to come out and Omnipotence undone/fixed."

Like extending the fights by making those awakened clones go easy on the kids and then realizing that they cannot hold back. Then they use >!chidori, tailed Beast bomb !< and whatever.\n\nI'm not even a writer, and I could think of stuff \ud83e\udd37",

            "Damn bro lol. I feel you. Everything else was meh... This manga feels like a grindy free to play game. Reading most of the dialogue feels like a grind. Content drop comes in the form small dlcs with more repetitive grindy shit.\n\nI still think the story can improve though.",

Like extending the fights by making those awakened clones go easy on the kids and then realizing that they cannot hold back.\n\nThe problem is they can hold back all they want is not like they went full power on them jura gave them a lot of time to show their skill, but is pointless they are heavily outmatched, it would be nonsense if they had to change their strategy because the \"cannot hold back\" I mean against team 10 really? Himawari may have the boost of power but she lacks the training and experience.",
