            "This is harassment",
            "Reporting her to the cops is smart. \n\nI once broke up with a woman (we dated for 4 months) who didn't take it well. I wasn't sure how to handle it. She was a heavy drinker and for a month after the breakup she would drunk text or call quite a bit. Once she drove to my house completely wasted just to beg/berate me. I drove her home (10 miles) in her car with the promise to buy her a box of wine on the way. Once I got her home, she was all happy because she thought I was stuck at her apartment with no way home. I told her I was just going to walk home. Once I got out of there I called a friend to come get me. \n\nShe proceeded to drink the whole box. A friend of hers visited and took her car keys when they learned she had driven. She decided that, since I had walked home, she was going to walk to my house. She attempted it, texting me every few minutes. I just shut off my phone. She was in Worcester, Massachusetts, which isn't the safest.\n\nThe next day I read all the texts, they went something like this: \n\nI am walking to your house.\n\nI am on Millbury Street.\n\nI am on Cliff Street\n\nI am on Route 9 (she wasn't anywhere near Rte 9, she was on Rte 20, both are busy State Highways, so she was a bit confused)\n\nIt is dark and there are no sidewalks\n\nI don't recognize anything, I am lost. Come get me.\n\nYou asshole, come get me, I am scared.\n\n(pause for nearly an hour, then) Nevermind, I got a ride from a trucker.\n\nI resisted checking if she was safe. I had no way to, without interacting with her. A few weeks later I receive a text that she got a dog which gave me a mixture of relief that she survived, horror that she was contacting me again, and sorrow for the dog. The next weekend, I was away with friends, when I got a long garbled voicemail from her. All I could understand from it was that she was going to my house. I was nervous what she might do, so I called my police department and explained the situation. I told them that I didn't want to get her in trouble, but that I was a little concerned because of the bad breakup. I live in a nice suburb of Worcester, so the police didn't mind driving by and checking out my house. It turns out that she was there trying to get her dog to shit on my lawn. Honestly, I was relieved that she wasn't burning down my house. The police just asked her to leave and she did, but she sent me several angry texts regarding what an ass I was for calling the cops on her, for bringing her dog over. Apparently she had never been so embarrassed in her life, but after that she left me alone at least. I wonder if she wasn't drunk, and shitting bricks that the police were going to notice and arrest her for driving.\n\nNext I heard from her was a couple years later when she called me to apologize as part of her AA journey. If I had known it was her I wouldn't have answered. Never delete the contact info from exes. I just said \"Okay\" and she got angry and yelled at me for not apologizing for breaking her heart. \n\nTL:DR: I called the police to have them make sure that my ex wasn't damaging my house, and that was enough to get her to leave me alone.",

            "I've been on the other end of this...\n\nShe had been cheating with some guy for months and one day asked for a few weeks of space due to stress/events in her life. Four weeks later, I get a short text saying \"hey, I think we should go our separate ways. Sure, it'll hurt for awhile, but I believe it's for the better. I wish you all the best\".\n\nI sent a rather long message, but it was calm. I asked to sit down and accepted the relationship was over. I explained how much she had meant to me and that there were things I needed to say (not to mention the chance to say goodbye). She responded by blocking me on absolutely everything (even Spotify). \n\nI heard from her about a month later after I had reached out to her friend I had never met (I'm ashamed of this). I didn't expose my ex, but rather explained I knew my ex and was worried about her/asked if she was okay. I then received a notification from my ex via SMS. \n\nThe narrative she built to justify what she had done still haunts me. She gaslit me into believing this was all my fault and that I deserved this. I asked to call. She said \"no, most of all not since your actions since the breakup\". I poured my heart out, explaining how much I care for her, and that I was sorry for contacting her like this - I told her how worried I had been and that I missed her. I wanted to understand and know what happened. She ignored what I said and responded with \"I gave you one last chance to accept reality. That's such a shame. I wish you all the best\". In her message, she threatened me with \"legal action\" and constructed an entirely false story to make me into a monster. I realize now that everything leading to her disappearance had been planned. \n\nWe had been together for well over a year and I truly believed I was going to marry this woman one day. In hindsight, I realize I never really knew her. I was kept at a distance from her real \"life\".\n\nI wont deny that I didn't handle it well. Over about 6 months, I made an alternate Snapchat account to contact her, blocked my caller ID to \"get through\" (never answered), and sent a handful of written letters. One day I woke up, and realized how crazy I had been acting. This person that I loved with every fiber of my being hadn't really existed. She cared, but in her own dysfunctional way. I never knew her. \n\nIt's been a year and a half now, and I'm still in therapy weekly.   I'm constantly confronting a battle within myself that I don't love / miss her. I quickly learned she was emotionally unwell when we were together, yet I thought I could support her. While she's not diagnosed, ive had several therapists state that she likely has borderline personality disorder. It's been the hardest journey of my life, and I'm stronger for it - yet, I question if it was worth losing the most sacred parts of myself over. I know one day I'll love again, but it'll never be the same.\n\nMoral of the story: there's two sides. He may be smearing her name or seeking sympathy to justify his actions. Or, she could simply be crazy / in love. Regardless, I think a bit of kindness to a past lover isn't awful. If you ever cared for this person, you would talk and see what they desperately needed to say to you. It's cruel. You're displaying her pain for your amusement.",

            "Yeah but you're missing my point here. All it takes is for them to show up and kill you. A protection order is an imaginary barrior to leave you alone. A gun will pretty much guarantee your safety. Or at the very least give you a higher chance to survive should they decide to just violate the order because they don't care.",
            "I got a restraining order and we had a gun that he had purchased for me to have for my protection... thing was when they served him with the domestic violence injunction and told him to vacate the premises, they allowed him to gather some of his belongings before he left. He took the gun with him, and returned two nights later and terrorized our daughters and I before eventually shooting someone and getting into a standoff with police. The gun bought for my protection (that i never wanted in the house in the first place) completely destroyed our lives, but the protection order didn't do anything but piss him off and escalate the severity of abuse, so neither IMHO",

            "It\u2019s always guns with you lot isn\u2019t it?",
            "ngl you just seem trigger happy. having a firearm for protection does not mean go for the kill. you disable and disarm them with it. you call for help and police intervention in the mean time. you just fucking kill somebody when you could have disabled and put them down on the floor, the police are gonna still look at you like a murderer regardless of the situation lmao. the protection order at least shows you tried to control the situation and protect yourself. if that fails, yes, by all means use legal self defense. but if you're immediate reaction is to kill instead of just disarm and disable to protect yourself, it kinda doesn't matter what your excuse is because at the end of the day, you could have taken measures to deescalate the situation without either of you dying.",

            "That was my point. Same idea, different execution. No harm done.",
            "And my point is the firearm provides a protection order and a way to defend yourself. Only benefit to me with a pertection order would be that when you shoot them and they die. It can be used in your defense that you did what you could to keep them away.",
            "Yeah. Because people can't seem to leave others alone. So threat of death seems to be the only option now. It's real simple. Don't bother people and attack them and you won't get shot.",
            "Yeah, here's a thought. If they didn't attack them. They wouldnt die. You know what keeps people alive. Not attacking others. Maybe you like being a victim to domestic violence idk. A protection order would def help a case should the offender die at the hands of a firearm. But at the end of the day being alive is def better than being dead and police can only show up so fast. Also no I'm not trigger happy. I'm just sick of offenders attacking victims and we have to somehow treat them with humanity. As far as I'm concerned if you're putting your hands on someone you have now been promoted to not human and should be put down. Don't put your fucking hands on people and you won't get fucking killed. This fear of death for actions needs to be widespread.",
            "If you are in fear for your life or bodily harm, you shoot to end the threat, period end of story.  If that results in death, then you stopped the threat. If that results in the attacker being incapacitated and surviving after docs put them back together great. But you don't ever shoot to disable, this isn't fucking Hollywood my guy",
            "Well duh I'm just saying I personally don't know how to do it on another phone because I have an iPhone... hence why I said I can show them if they have the same phone as me. Not all phones work the same.",
            "Lmao what??? Being harassed is scary no matter who is doing it. That's literally a fact. What are you even talking about???",
            "I'm a girl and I've been harassed by both men and women. It's scary every time. What exactly is your point?? You wanna play \"who has been traumatized more\"??? Cuz it's not a contest. You're mad weird for even responding like that when all I did was say that this situation is scary no matter what???",
            "I think you're misunderstanding my point, in that I never said to only go with the PO and not a firearm.  If you do end up having to use the firearm, having the PO will also show a paper trail of harassment by that person and less likely to have charges filed against you.",
            "no, i don't like being a victim to violence lmao. i'm not even defending people who go out of their way to attack and harm people, but i am looking at this situation realistically. being imprisoned for life for murdering someone in self-defense?? doesn't sound like something that's gonna necessarily make me want to continue living. in this instance nothing was mentioned about the ex-gf attacking him. stalking? maybe. but if he would have shot her on the premise of her just showing up, that shit's not going to be labeled self-defense. use the rational side of your brain for once instead of trying to convince someone they should ruin their life when there are alternative ways to keep themselves safe. not everyone is okay with the idea of rotting away in prison because they reacted extremely to a manageable situation. nowhere in my comment did i ever say not to protect yourself. but the idea is to disable and disarm, not go straight for the kill. she may be crazy and obsessed enough to try getting him to talk to her, but it doesn't mean she deserves to be killed immediately under an assumption. take care.",
            "no implications whatsoever of me being influenced by hollywood. defense =/= okay to murder regardless of seriousness of threat. if you know how to aim, disabling shouldn't be an issue.\n\n \"Any time you use lethal force in self-defense, death of the attacker is a potential outcome by nature, but should not be the intent. \"Shooting to kill\" means your intent is to kill the attacker, whereas \"shooting to stop\" means your intent is to stop the attacker from continuing their\u00a0unlawful attack.\" that doesn't indicate going for the kill. but if you don't mind a wrongful accusation winding you in prison for a possible life sentence, that's your prerogative, not mine.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

            "You are literally the type of person this group is talking about",

She asked me if I gave her chlamydia and I told her no which is true because when I went to get tested both times after she asked me the results were negative while hers was positive. She told me that her results were probably false but I told her those tests are 99% accurate. She\u2019s says she hasn\u2019t had sex with anyone else but it\u2019s an std so I\u2019m confused.
