            "i finshed the Lord of the Rings again.  \n  i started Agatha Christie's Hallowe'en Party. Bought it a few months after Haunting in Venice came out.",
            "Finished: Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir. So good! One of my favorites of the year. \n\n\nStarted: Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir",
            "Started:\nDark Matter by Blake Crouch (read 50 pages in an hour so far so good!! very captivating)\n\nFinished:\nBig Swiss by Jen Beagin (i did not like this at all it was so boring it took me 2 months to finish which is LONG for me. The way the main character talked was just so unnatural\u2026it kind of reminded me of fleabag but like\u2026not good. I honestly felt like nothing happened even though there was clearly a plot\u2026anyway i was disappointed bc everyone loves this book and it\u2019s getting turned into a show)",
            "Annihilation, by Jeff Vandermeer",
            "I finished \"Emily Wilde's encyclopedia of faeries\" and \"Emily Wilde's map of the Otherlands\" now I have to wait for the next book to come out \ud83d\ude2d And nownim currently re-reading agggtm<3 (and annotating it this time round)\n\nEdit: I only made a Reddit acc today so I'm super sorry that I can't format it the way you want, im not sure how to do bold text",
            "Started: **I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter by Erika S\u00e1nchez**",
            "finished rereading - Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami",
            "Finished reading Crime and Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoevsky and started reading Ulysses, by James Joyce. I'm 15 and have really been enjoying literature this past year, so I was glad to find this reddit community.",
            "**Started**\n\n**No Mean City, by H. Kingsley Long and Alexander McArthur** - A harrowing book about the Gorbals in 1930s Glasgow and the experiences of people living in the slum settlement. A contemporary setting at the time it was written. It follows a \"Razor King\" (*a la* Peaky Blinders) and the trouble he gets into becoming an influental figure in the Glasgow gang scene. \n\nNot too far into it, but really loving it. Being from near Glasgow myself, near everyone in my family has read it, so it's a rite of passage really.\n\n**JFK - The Conspiracy and the Truth Behind the Assassination, by John Hughes-Wilson** - Going down another rabbit hole about the JFK Assassination recently and I love indulging in this stuff from time to time. Never read any full books on the subject however, so making this one my first before going on to more seminal works like Six Seconds in Dallas\n\n**Men Who Hate Women, by Laura Bates** - A re-read to use it's ideas to hopefully from a hatespeech/online safety course as part of my teaching job. Incredible work by Bates as she poses as an \"incel\" to live in their spaces and discover how it really goes in these dark corners of the internet. _Highly_ recommended, especially for men and boys, and parents of vulnerable boys.",

            "finished: heroes of olympus - the lost hero, by rick riordan\n\nstarted: a brief history of time, by stephen hawking",
            "Finished: *Funny Story* by Emily Henry. Gave it an unfortunate 2 stars.  \n Started: *The Hobbit* and *Red Rising*. I'm done with romance for a while!",
            "Finished:\n\n**Butter, by Asako Yuzuki** this book was great for its commentary on feminism, fatphobia, and general scrutiny against women, especially in Japan. However I was hoping it would lean heavier on the murder side but that certainly wasn\u2019t the main focus of the book. I also must have read a synopsis of a different book around the same time I read one for this book because I thought it was about cannibalism, not spoiler: it\u2019s not!\n\nStarted:\n\n**Still Life With Woodpecker, by Tom Robbins**\n\nI\u2019ve read this book a few times before and I love to keep rereading it. Definitely some problematic writing here and there but overall very goofy and funny",
            "im currently reading the princess bride",
            "Finished:\n\n* **Midnight's Children** by Salman Rushdie\n\n* **The Great Divorce** by C.S. Lewis\n\nStarted:\n\n* **The Count of Monte Cristo** by Alexandre Dumas",
            "Read Jurassic Park on my honeymoon in Portugal.\n\nLoved the much headier dive in and explanation of the park and dinosaurs, hated the action sequences.",
            "**Finished**:\n\n*The War of the Worlds* by H.G. Wells. Awful to know that, in event of martian invasion, humanity will act exactly the same way as they (conceivably) did a century before. \"Dead London\" was of the most disquieting chapters I've read in some time. \n\n\n\n**Started**:\n\n*Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy* by John le Carr\u00e9. Chatting with old friends has never been more tense.",
            "Started\n\nNone of this is true\n\nSurviving Chaos",
            "Finished: Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell (holy FUCK this was so good)\n\nStarted: The Lacuna by Barbara Kingsolver",
            "Finished:\n\n**Crapalachia: A Biography of a Place by Scott McClanahan**\n\n*We past the torch of life from one another like runners in the night. I will forever be reaching for you, please keep reaching for me. Please.*\n\n**Blood in the Machine: The Origins of the Rebellion Against Big Tech by Brian Merchant** I liked the way this book is written. Short, easy to follow chapters. I find the Luddite movement very interesting and learned quite a lot about it. It was also nice, reading about a few important literature figures of that time, and their role in the movement.\n\n*If we are ingenious enough to automate large-scale production, build spacecraft, and invent artificial intelligences, are we not ingenious enough to ensure that advancing technology benefits all, and not just a few?*\n\nStarted\n\n**The Humans by Matt Haig** Oh, this book isn\u2019t for me. To be fair I\u2019m only at the 30% mark but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll continue with it. It\u2019s just ridiculous and annoying. It tries really hard to be quirky and funny but it\u2019s really not. At least not to me. Plus this, a quote from the book: *As the human alphabet only has 26 letters it was an incredibly simple system,\u2026* So, TIL that I\u2019m not human, since in my language the alphabet has 24 letters\u2026 *sigh*",
            "Finished:\n\n**I'm Thinking of Ending Things, by Iain Reid**\n\nLoved, loved, loved it.  I watched the movie a while ago and while I appreciated how WEIRD it is, it kind of lost me.  The book I found to be much better and also much easier to follow through the weirdness and connect what's going on.  That ending sequence is sad and hits hard once you realize what's going on.\n\nStarting:\n\n**The House Across the Lake, by Riley Sager**\n\nI'm starting this today and I've heard good things so I'm excited to dive in!",
            "Finished We have always lived in the castle, and started the testaments.\n\nWe have always lived in the castle was intriguing. It felt like I was reading the origin story for an eternal presence in the building. Also, the part where >!the townspeople started adding salt to the wound with the fire!< had a visceral reaction in me. Overall an interesting view into the psyche of 2 insular young women.\n\nIt's been a while since I read the handmaids tale, so I'm still getting into the flow of the testaments still. But I'm looking forward to see where it's going to go",
            "Started: Wraiths of the Broken Land by S. Craig Zahler\n\nFirst Lie Wins by Ashley Elston\n\nFinished: None of This Is True by Lisa Jewell",
            "FINISHED\n\n**Well Enough Alone: A Cultural History of My Hypochondria, by Jennifer Traig** (audiobook)\n\nA science-slanted, pretty funny and self-deprecating memoir. Maybe some off-color jokes at her own expense, but I do think that makes the story all the more genuine and personal than some other memoirs.\n\n**Whale Fall, by Elizabeth O\u2019Connor**\n\nI devoured this in nearly one sitting. Idyllic coastal Wales is such a beautiful setting to me, and I\u2019m glad the author gave it (and towns like it) a lived-in experience in this story.\n\n**What We Fed to the Manticore, by Talia Lakshmi Kolluri** (audiobook)\n\nI enjoy short stories but haven\u2019t read too many books from animals\u2019 perspectives. It was fun to do so here, and I thought the choice in narrators helped accentuate the specific animals telling each of the stories.\n\nSTARTED/STARTING\n\n**The Fraud, by Zadie Smith** (continuing)\n\n**The Eye of Darkness, by George Mann**\n\n**Service Model, by Adrian Tchaikovsky** (audiobook)\n\n**How to Become the Dark Lord and Die Trying, by Django Wexler** (audiobook)",
            "Finished: *The Cartographers* by Peng Shepherd\nStarting: TBD. Headed to the book shop after work to see what I might find",
            "Finished: \n\nBel Canto, by Ann Patchett. Loved it and found it genuinely moving, though the ending threw me off quite a bit. \n\nLong Island, by Colm Toibin. Loved Brooklyn, and this sequel is very well-written even though I found the abrupt ending unsatisfying. I hope he isn't done telling the story of Eilis Lacey. \n\nThe Last House on Needless Street, by Catriona Ward. Listened to this on audiobook and absolutely hated it. Thought it was just kind of dumb. Everything hinges on a very obvious twist. \n\nStarted: \n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, by J.K. Rowling.",
            "**Sesame Street: \\[\\] Let's Play (2019) by Craig Manning**\n\nThis is a custom printed book where the kid's name goes after the colon. My toddler is really into this one right now. Largely a book about a kid looking for the Sesame Street characters in a game of hide and seek. Definitely fun for that age group. Strangely near the beginning Elmo calls out your kids name then says he knows your name because \"you're so smart and nice\". As if that somehow answers it.",
            "Finished: Something She's Not Telling Us, Darcey Bell\n\nStarted: How To Sell A Haunted House, Grady Hendrix",
            "Just finished the three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch by Phillip K Dick.\n\nDo androids dream of electric sheep is easily one of my favourite books - 5/5. The three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch is probably a 4/5, the characters in the hovel in mars are all pretty forgettable (apart from Anne hawthorne) and the last two chapters seemed a bit convoluted. Definitely one I need to revisit though.\n\nJust started The Trial by Franz kafka. Can't comment on this one, I've only just finished chapter one.",
            "Started:\n\n**The Science of Meditation, by Daniel Goleman & Richard J. Davidson** - Starting this one later today, so I'll just put it here. I'm really in a period where I'm interested in learning about living a healthier life, so I'll explore the benefits of meditation here (I hope).\n\nFinished:\n\n**AI 2041, by Kai-Fu Lee and Chen Qiufan -** Even though it's three years old, and the space of AI is moving quickly, I still think it's relevant today and highly interesting. The combination of fiction and non-fiction (each new chapter/technology started with a short fiction story to set the scene for that particular technology before it was explained) was interesting and I would say I liked it done in that way, though I would've liked some more in depth analysis of the technology behind it. \n\n**Krigens Logik, by Anders Puck Nielsen** **-** He has a very good YouTube channel where he speaks of the war in Ukraine. This is a very introductory book to the logic behind war. However, for myself and many others from my generation, we haven't really been exposed to war in Europe so it is nice to get a introduction to a lot of the terms used in war.\n\nStill reading:\n\n**The Making of the English Working Class, by E.P. Thompson**\n\n**Stranger in a Strange Land, by Robert A. Heinlein**\n\n**Grimm's M\u00e4rchen, by Brothers Grimm**",
            "Finished: The Vanishing Half, by Brit Bennett.  Not sure what to start next, I have a few options.",
            "Hunting Adeline. Tbh, I am very surprised by the reaction I saw on tiktok. It was the worst thing I have ever read. And not bc of the smutty scenes (they were too much I think), but the writing was very bad for me. I actually skipped a bunch of pages all the time. Sorry if you like, and I offended you.",
            "Books: Finished T\u00e9a Obreht's The Morningside, started Ferdia Lennon's Glorious Exploits\n\nAudiobooks: Finished Emily Henry's Funny Story, started R. F. Kuang's Babel",
            "Finished The Well of Ascension by Brandon Sanderson.\nStarted Red Rising by Pierce Brown.",
            "Finished:\n\nAnna Karenina, by Leo Tolstoy.\n\nThis book took me ages lol.\u00a0",
            "Finished: \n\n**Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, by Gabrielle Zevin** - 5/5 stars. Honestly? It\u2019s an instant classic. \n\nStarted: \n\n**Same Bed Different Dreams, by Ed Park**",
            "Finished: \nBeware of Pity by Stefan Zweig (5 stars)  - this was a bit of a random pick up for me after a TikTok recommendation. I had never heard of this author before but after finishing this I will definitely be checking out his other works. The book was so funny, heartwarming and gut wrenching all at once. \n\nJade Legacy by Fonda Lee (4 stars) - I was happy to wrap this series up. I found the middle of the book quite slow and the pacing of the novel annoyed me at points but overall the whole series was really great and was wrapped up perfectly. \n\nStarted: \nBig Swiss by Jen Beagin",
            "I finished reading Harry Potter deathly hallows read about 200 pages of it on Sunday and Monday combined. Started Ballad of the songbirds and snakes today and am going to start crown of midnight and golden sun hopefully.",
            "Started:\u00a0 The Godfather, by Mario Puzo\nStarted: The Hobbit, by J. R. R. Tolkien\n\n\nTrying out the classics. Looks like it's gonna take a looooong while....",
            "Nobody Wants to Read Your Sh@t by Steven Pressfield",
            "Started and finished: The Housemaid and The Housemaid\u2019s secret by Freida McFadden\nStarted: The Viscount Who Loved Me by Julia Quinn",
            "Finished Notes from Underground, By Fyodor Dostoevsky \n\nStarted:  Homage to Catalonia, By George Orwell",
            "Finished:\n\n**The House in the Cerulean Sea** by **T J Clune**. \n\n**The Sanatorium** by **Sarah Pearse**\n\n**The Thursday Murder Club** by **Richard Osman**\n\nStarted:\n\n**After Story** by **Larissa Behrendt** a moving story from the POV of an Indigenous Australian mother and her adult daughter who have a somewhat estranged relationship, on a literary journey in England. Can tell this will be a very thought provoking journey, makes me want to hug my mum tight. \n\n**Red String Theory** by **Lauren Kung Jessen**\n\nWorking through some reading challenge prompts lately. Enjoying reading outside of what I\u2019d normally choose.",
            "**Love Roma 3, by Minoru Toyoda**\n\n\nWell here was a wacky romcom featuring one of the most blunt and straightforward guys you've ever seen declaring his love for the girl he likes right out the gate. And featuring one big quirky peanut gallery as they watch (and butt in on) the new couple. And this couple does get together fast so that's a novelty. None of that will they won't they shtick. \n\n\nI've seen better romcoms. And I'll admit sometimes the expanded cast got a bit on my nerves. But it's not without it's charm. Not to mention it's got a unique artstyle to it.",
            "Finished: \n\nJust for the Summer, Abby Jimenez. Such a cute little rom com book. Technically a series but can be read stand alone. Super creative to have some overlap with her other books but it still be able to be read by itself. \n\n  \nCurrently Reading: \n\nThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, Suzanne Collins. Always a big fan of the Hunger Games so thought this was interesting. I want Snow to be good and do the right thing but he must have some crazy villain origin story.",
            "the da vinci code",
            "This week I finished Elenor Oliphant is completely fine and The Good Mother both on audio. Both pretty good. The Good Mother was infuriating.",
            "Finished: Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience by Mih\u00e1ly Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi\n\nSomehow, it helps me a lot through my hard times.\n\nStarted: Twenty Thousands Leagues Under the Seas by Jules Verne",
            "Finished reading Dark Matter and started Oathbringer",
            "Finished Reading:\n\n**Erasure by Percival Everett** for my bookclub. Also watched the film adaptation American Fiction. Damn he's clever, jokes on us.\n\n**I Might Regret This: Essays, Drawings, Vulnerabilities, and Other Stuff by Abby Jacobson.** I enjoyed it and all her internal anxieties and awkward moments.",
            "Geralds Game. My 32nd book by King. Hated it from from start to finish. Ranked 32/32",
            "**Lapvona, by Ottessa Moshfegh**",
            "Finished Lonesome Dove by Larry McMurtry. I loved like 90% of this book and was very meh on the ending.\n\nStarted The Paper Menagerie by Ken Liu",
            "Finished: goldfinch by donna tart\nStarted: the bell jar by sylvia plath",

            "**Leviathan Falls, by James S. A. Corey.**\n\n9th and final book of The Expanse series. Big sad that its over :(",

            "Northanger Abbey, should have read it a long time ago but it was really really good",
            "Started: Demon Copperhead, by Barbara Kingsolver\n\nStarted and finished: Anita de Monte Laughs Last, by Xochitl Gonzalez",
            "I just finished Anne of Green Gables by Lucy Maud Montgomery and it seriously an amazing book with amazing vocabulary and description and would recommend to everyone who shares a imaginative mind like Anne. Even though this is a short book of only 400 pages I finished it in almost 2 weeks but is still extraordinary. Am now onto the second book called Anne of Avonlea!",
            "Finished\n\n**Hyperion, by Dan Simmons**\n\nIt was a tad hard to get into but once I was in it I really enjoyed the structure as a succession of the pilgrims' stories. I was however unconvinced by the last story that was much longer than the rest and did not really appear as connected as the rest. It felt like the author, reaching the end of the book was trying to cram a satisfying ending. I know that there is a second book but the end of the first did not make me want to pick up the next one right away. I have become bored with understanding who the Shrike is and what he/it does and why. Also, I was a bit turned of by the multiple unnecessary intimate scenes, especially in the last chapter. There were too many and they felt a bit indulgent.\n\n**Into Thin Air, by Jon Krakauer**\n\nI read this one over the weekend. I chose it because of multiple recommendations received about non-fiction. A sad story with a forgone conclusion. I really enjoyed the writing and felt gasping for air like the author throughout. Going back to a tragic event and picking apart one's own responsibility in it was courageous of the author. But I did get lost several times with the sheer number of names (people) on that mountain.\n\nStarted\n\n**Sharp Objects, by Gillian Flynn**\n\nI read Gone Girl many moons ago so I figured I'd give this one a try. I still really like Flynn's writing. It is breathless and very cinematic which I like. She has a way of capturing some characters like when she describes Alan as \"the opposite of moist\" that is funny.",
            "Finished:\n\n**Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen** *(re-read)*\n\n**Assyria: The Rise and Fall of the World's First Empire, by Eckhart Framm**\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed Framm's history of Assyria, with a couple of caveats. By far the most interesting chapter was on social history: daily life in the Empire. But, as he makes clear, there is much less evidence for this than for what takes up the bulk of the books, the travails of the various Assyrian kings. Reckoning with the paucity of the historical record makes for interesting material at times, such as in his discussion of the conflicting record as it intersects with the Bible's history. But at times it just leaves a lot of \"could have beens\", which quickly become \"we don't know\". I'm also not fully convinced by his argument about the legacy of the Assyrian empire. That said, I would definitely recommend the book to anyone interested in the period, and the final chapter (on ISIS's destruction of Assyria's cultural legacy) makes for a brutal coda.\n\nStarted:\n\n**Mansfield Park, by Jane Austen**\n\nThe Austen read/re-read plods on. I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice a little less on re-read than I did first time around, but it still has some lively and interesting characters. Mansfield Park, however, is built around an insipid drip called Fanny Price who is the least interesting and sympathetic heroine possible.\n\nNo one reads Jane Austen for gritty social realism, and it's a cheap form of critique to say \"what about the servants?\" etc., when that's simply not what the books are about. But if it's an unfair criticism of Pride and Prejudice to say the Bennet sisters are worrying about how many thousands of pounds a year they will have at a time when most people lived in abject poverty, it seems a bit fairer for Mansfield Park. Fanny is one of eight or nine children and is taken to Mansfield Park to grow up: yes, it's sad she doesn't get to ride her pony, but her siblings probably have bigger concerns? And Sir Thomas's holdings are in \"Antigua\": we know what that means. I am not someone obsessed with \"postcolonial\" readings, but it's really difficult to feel the sympathy that we seem to be required to have for Fanny when the Bertrams' wealth is built on the backs of slaves on sugar plantations.\n\nI'm only halfway through so maybe all this will be resolved in the final chapters, though I have a hunch that a certain cousin marriage might just loom a little larger in the plans.",
            "Finished:\n\nFlame in the Mist by Ren\u00e9e Ahdieh (kindle). It was OK, I liked it enough to finish. Very slow paced until around 70% in where everything suddenly pick up, which made it feel a bit rushed. I always struggle a little bit with stories that include Japanese / samurai influences etc as the characters always talk to each other in quite a formal way and that holds me back from being immersed into the story. If I see the sequel on sale, I'll read that too. If not, then I won't. \n\nStarted:\n\nOut of the Silent Planet by C.S. Lewis (kindle). Downloaded this randomly before I went on holiday but was too invested in the Stormlight Archive to read it. I'm not even 10% in yet so not many thoughts yet. \n\n\nStill working on:\n\nRed Rising by Pierce Brown (audio). I think it was the wrong decision to pick up where I left it all those months ago because I have no idea what is going on lol. It feels like The Hunger Games atm. \n\nCode Name Verity by Elizabeth Wein (physical copy). Took my book out several times without reading it. So far I'm not feeling it, but I keep seeing that it will pick up soon and people stating it's a tearjerker (which I like).",
            "Finished:\n\n**A Confession, by Leo Tolstoy**\n\n**In Watermelon Sugar, by Richard Brautigan**\n\n**Convenience Store Woman, by Sayaka Murata**\n\nStarted:\n\n**The Martian Chronicles, By Ray Bradbury**",
            "*Started*\n\n**Wheel of Time Book 2 - The Great Hunt - Robert Jordan**",
            "Finished:\n\n**Jingo, by Terry Pratchett** - The last City Watch book for a while didn't have the awe factor I've gotten used to from Pratchett's conclusions. It was fine. The examination of xenophobia and racism were well handled, I thought. 4/5\n\n**Gravity's Rainbow, by Thomas Pynchon** - In short - this was a crazy horny book that was mad difficult to follow. Objectively brilliant writing. Felt unmoored while reading and didn't find much enjoyment outside of the odd bits of surrealism that struck home. 4/5\n\nStarted/Continuing\n\n**Fall of Light, by Steven Erikson** - When I see how poorly the Karkhanas books have sold compared to *MBotF*, I'm a little disheartened. They're fantastic (at least, for me)! \n\n**Wolf Hall, by Hillary Mantel** - I don't do a lot of historical fiction, but this has been highly recommended. I'm 1/3 of the way through and It's not bad so far.\n\n**The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao** - A fun contemporary novel with a fun narrative structure.",
            "I started reading **Infinite Jest, by David Foster Wallace**\n\nI could tell within the first few pages that Wallace was a genius with the way he analogized things both in a way I'd never thought of and that helped me understand perfectly what he meant.  I also really love how strongly he commits to the show don't tell approach.  If you actually want to find out the plot of the book and the background behind it you have to slowly gather the details from conversations people have with each other.  Some plotlines and settings have felt more interesting than others (I find the antics at the tennis academy a lot of fun), but Wallace's style of writing and insight have generally been good enough to keep me going on the not as interesting parts (I'm a little over 1/3 of the way through the book right now).",
            "Finished: **Life, the Universe and Everything by Douglas Adams**\n\nLife, the Universe, and Everything was a disappointment after the first two Hitchhiker's books. I was absolutely hooked with the previous two - this one didn't appeal to me in the same way. Despite being the same length as the other two, it felt longer, and some sections were a chore to get through. I took a few weeks' break halfway through and dabbled in some other books before I finished it. The characters are great; the writing is both bizarre and scathingly satirical at points; I just didn't click with it the same way. Will probably come back to it once I've finished the series.\n\nStarted (almost finished): **Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde**\n\nI picked this up in the local library as it's something I've meant to read since I was a teenager. I love Gothic fiction but often find anything pre-20th century a bit of a slog to get through. But I had some free time and it was short enough, so I started it. Not much to say on it as it's a classic for a reason and many people will have reviewed it better than I could, but I'm loving it and will be sad to finish it. Despite roughly knowing the plot, I found it was so well-written that I was surprised by how I responded. Lord Henry makes me so angry that I have a visceral reaction. The painting is deeply unsettling. I'm glad I made some time for this one.",

It's my third Dostoevsky and I haven't even gotten to Crime and Punishment! I'm halfway through this one and it's really picking up. I love the narrator's snark.

This story is about a prince who sets out to find an almost legendary seed to help give his people a better life. And encountering things like slave traders. And other things in his quest. But that aside this one was actually formatted as a picture book story akin to other stories of the like I've happened across and read like *Sea Prayer by Khaled Hosseini* or *Have You Seen Marie? by Sandra Cisneros*.

It remained cozy, lighthearted and fun throughout, but I lost some interest with the introduction of the secondary character who I found quite irritating. I would much rather a story where Wilde explored the Faerie world on her own and got to know/work with the interesting Townspeople than this other character.\n\n\u201cThe Housemaid\u201d was so much fun.

I really enjoyed the first book, was pretty meh on the second book, didn't mind the third book (although, found Joe so bloody annoying rather than creepy for the most part, but found the plot and Joe's obsessive stupidity entertaining enough to finish it nonetheless)... but this fourth book? Jeez Louise with anti-freeze. I'm guessing Kepnes is contractually obligated to write a certain amount of Joe Goldberg books, because I have no clue why she'd be beating this dead horse otherwise. This fourth instalment is just... *awful*. It's so uninspired. Keynes has completely lost direction with Joe Goldberg and his character. The writing in this book reads to me like Kepnes was drinking heavily and bashing with directionless desperation on the keyboard just to get the book over with. I gave up about 50, maybe 60 pages in.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nSo, after I tossed that crumby book into the library return chute...\n\n**Started**: ***The Book Thief*, by Markus Zusak**.

Evan Smoak, the former black ops assassin Orphan X, has turned to providing his skills to those who are truly desperate. In this story he is struggling with having tracked down his own biological father, and he was underwhelmed by the experience of meeting him. This personal struggle leads him to a bout of uncharacteristic drunkenness in which we find him at the debut of the book. His young niece needs him to find her missing chihuahua and unenthusiastically taking on this task causes an encounter with a female assassin killing an accomplished computer scientist. Pursuing this woman known as The Wolf in an effort to protect the scientists teenage daughter who has seen the assassins face becomes his next goal. I enjoy this series for the humor of the interpersonal confusion Evan Smoak goes through with his odd personality and OCD behaviors.\n\nStarted: **The Price You Pay, by Nick Petrie**",

It attempted a lot, missed a lot, and alternated between abstruse and repetitively explanatory/expository.

I know nothing of the cultural/historical/racial component. \n\nControversies surrounding the xenophobia of the author are conflated with the character of Marlow. For someone living in the latter part of the 19th century, Marlow is remarkably non-racist. And since the story is based on real events that the author experienced, it is extremely heart-felt and driven by a willingness to penetrate the human soul, something few people are capable of (namely Carl Jung, which is the angle I was taking when reading this book). It's a very compassionate book, barely having anything to do with race.\n\nThe book was a bit drab and written with a lot of prose. The concept is appealing, but the execution was a bit lost on me. I couldn't understand some scenes, having to re-read multiple times to understand what's being implied. A lot of references to textiles. \n\nKurtz is interesting but the character is not explored very much.\n\nI'd write more but I have a feeling no one will read this.",

He tells us to pursue our own happiness as an ultimate end, but also that it is our duty to maximize happiness for others (actions are only good to the extent they generate happiness). But these things are not compatible. To what extent are we obligated to pursue communal rather than individual happiness? What if these goals conflict? I understand that a life well lived will include both pursuits, but is that really the core wisdom of utilitarianism? Seems kind of obvious to me.",

            "Funny! The commentary on nationality and immigration was what annoyed me. I grew up with immigrant parents from South Korea in Australia and those opinions is what annoyed me. I know that\u2019s a bit odd but I just couldn\u2019t relate. I also know quite a few people with similar backgrounds of the narrator and I found it odd that the narrator was so fixated on her background yet didn\u2019t really seem to link it to anything.\n\nI agree that the sci-fi and thriller was bad which I think was because the author lacked plot. They also didn\u2019t have any character development and I ended up disliking the majority of them. On the romance bit, well there was no romance only just a glimpse of the future.\n\nMy dislike is even worsened by the fact this book could\u2019ve been SO amazing yet the author couldn't write very well. She had ridiculous bits of writing. Her metaphors, adjectives etc just didn\u2019t make sense sometimes. One was like I\u2019m a doll in a plastic bottle - just no.\n\nThat\u2019s why and it was also a book club so I HAD to finish it.\u00a0",
            "I think it's pretty good, I've reread it a few times.",
            "I really liked it. It had a lot of things I love and executed them greatly. If you like m/m romance and stories set in World War 1, then this is a must-read.\n\nA fair warning: because it is set in a wartime period, it does have some gore and graphic content. They are few and far between, but they are quite noticeable. So if you don't like stuff like that, I wouldn't recommend it as much. The author did not pull any punches regarding the realities of war.",
            "It\u2019s huge!! But I\u2019m liking it so far! I hope you enjoy it :)",
            "Ohh thanks for sharing, now I'm really looking forward to Yumi. My theory on why I was disappointed by the GO book is that Neil Gaiman made many small adjustments for the show. He's mentioned several times that he and Terry Pratchett had discussed a lot of things that didn't end up in the final book, and things that they'd put in a sequel (which they didn't end up publishing, but did influence S2 of the show), for example, Crowley and Aziraphale's romance. The show did more to build up to that, I think, while they'd never planned for such a scene while writing the book.",
            "Thanks for sharing your perspective! Definitely going to be thinking on that perspective. \n\nAnd I imagine being forced to finish it because of a book club makes it even more frustrating. I'm usually pretty liberal with my DNF - that's a part of why I've never managed to join a book club myself, haha",

            "Ireland was on the fringes of Europe during the \"dark ages\". This insulated them somewhat from a lot of the political and social turmoil of that period, as a bit of a backwater.

Coming out of that period, they had a much higher literacy rate, and a whole network of interconnected centers of learning and document preservation (monasteries and such). There's an interesting book on this topic called ***How The Irish Saved Civilization*** (full title: *How the Irish Saved Civilization: The Untold Story of Ireland's Heroic Role from the Fall of Rome to the Rise of Medieval Europe).* During the early middle ages \"Irish\" was nearly synonymous with scholar in much of Europe. These were the guys who could read, and actually had read most of the great works of ancient literature (since in many cases the only surviving copies were in Ireland), they knew poetry and myths from all over, etc.\n\nCombined with a long cultural tradition of story telling and history reciting (bards were highly honored and had a role in the Brehon legal system of Gaelic Ireland... hell, one of the national symbols of Ireland is a bardic harp) you end up with a culture with a lot of literate people who grew up hearing amazing ancient tales that entertained and taught life lessons and dictated morals, etc etc. Add in a few dozen generations of oppression and alcoholism, and you've got the perfect recipe for a great literary tradition. Top it all with a horrific famine that killed over 1/8 of the population, and sent another 3/8 of the population all around the world in a famine-fleeing diaspora, and we **all** get to enjoy their literary talents. (Crazy note... the famine reduced the populaiton of Ireland by nearly HALF, and it has only almost *nearly* recovered to its pre-famine population TODAY, in the 21st century, nearly 200 years later)",
            "Storytelling and poetry have always been a huge part of Irish culture, so much so that in ancient Ireland the societal status of poets was almost on a par with royalty. \n\nIn more recent times, the country invests in its writers. We have organisations like the Arts Council, the Irish Writers Centre, Poetry Ireland etc that provide bursaries and other funding and training. There\u2019s quite a few presses of varying sizes and specialties. Many literary festivals. Lots of journals and magazines. Irish people like reading and they like reading work by Irish writers.",

They matter but it is is difficult to quantify why.  \n\nGood education with really literacy rates, there was even a culture of valuing education by large parts of the country, this has been going for decades. \n\nLarge amounts of Irish emigrating and retaining cultural connections played a part.  Writers need readers so having access to markets to sell their work to helped.  \n\nSpeaking English also helped in my opinion in recent times, it gave all writers a direct market in the US, UK and elsewhere, with most the direct need for translation.  Lots might disagree with that opinion.  \n\nThere was some moves by Irish governments to promote the value of artist work.  One government made income from artistic work tax free up to a certain amount (but it was so difficult to do, it needed to claimed back and a bureaucratic nightmare).

So? France has 16. The UK has 12. (Counting George Bernard Shaw for both the UK and Ireland). The population numbers don't really matter here, because the distribution is not \"random\" but influenced by many factors. For example, the Swedish Academy won't give 14 Nobels to England for every 1 they give to Ireland, because it's very much a political decision.

When the printing press made it's way to Ireland, copies of \"rebellion\" pamphlets would be passed along 20-30 times, since they could only print so may copies. Also, they had to be clever, since if they were too rebellious with their words, they'd get sghut down, this led to lots of metaphors and double meanings. \n\nIt took a LONG time for the Irish to get out from under the English.

Here, far from the barbarian despoliation of the continent, monks and scribes laboriously, lovingly, even playfully preserved the west's written treasures.

            "Most of the works from Irish writers of the time were in Latin, which was the literary language. Some are in Greek. Textual evidence indicates that it was not uncommon for Irish writers of the time to be fluent in Irish, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew and the first two were pretty much universal among the literate class.\n\nThere is a corpus of literature in Old Irish too but it was mostly stuff written in Ireland for an Irish audience (annals, legal stuff about brehon law, mythological/legendary stuff, hagiographies of local Irish saints etc.). That said, that literary corpus is the largest extant one of any vernacular language in that period in Europe.\n\nSo \"Irish\" was synonymous with scholarship, but the *Irish language* wasn't, it was just another vernacular language mostly confined to its own native region albeit with a thriving literary scene in that region.\n\nThe reasons for the decline in Irish as a spoken and written language come later and are mostly a result of active suppression of the language by the British authorities during their rule of Ireland in favour of English, giving rise to an economic incentive to adopt English, and then the mass depopulation of the great famine which hit the (poorer) native Irish speaking communities the worst. The late medieval through early modern period also saw the destruction of the gaelic nobility, the old monastic system, and with them the bardic tradition. The educated and wealthy classes of native Irish responsible for Irish scholarship flourishing during the medieval basically all got killed, exiled never to return, or assimilated into the English nobility. Or in the case of the monasteries assimilated into the Roman church (that part had nothing to do with the English).\n\nBy the time that modern literature emerges Irish was already waning even in Ireland and was eliminated from the wealthier classes. Educated people did not speak or write in Irish. For a part of this period publishing a work in Irish was illegal anyway, even if a native speaker had the means to do so. \n\nEven after that, there was little audience for Irish works because the remaining Irish speaking communities were barely able to survive. The people in Ireland who had the leisure time and money to buy and consume literary works all spoke English. Hence why the literary output of Ireland in the early modern to modern periods is almost entirely in English. The people who got the opportunities to publish spoke English; the people who could afford to buy their books spoke English.  \n\nThe gaelic revival saw a rise in Irish language books, but it's still more of a trickle than a flood. The base of native speakers is just very small (<200k total now). You can't really expect the same kind of output from a population of <1 million people compared to languages spoken by tens or hundreds of millions.",

It's storytelling in a raw form where you can turn to the stranger at the bus stop and say \"that seagull is being weird\" and they'll reply with an anecdote \"jaysus I saw one once that shoplifted...\" \nAnd we have a curiosity that's frankly nosiness about other people.\nOutside of dublin everything is news, who's your father? who's died? \n\nBefore the famine it's said the west of ireland hummed with the noise of voices, there were so many people chatting.\nPeople deemed 4th class as they were living in mud huts, had so much to share and sing they collectively created a din in wind blasted valleys.",

I agree with it in principle in some cases (for example, there's only about 6 countries in the world where Baseball is popular, likewise for Rugby, and obviously those countries excel at those sports compared to everybody else, even if their population should happen to be relatively smaller).\n\nHowever, I'd argue that \"literature\" or, more broadly, \"storytelling\" (so including non-western oral traditions, folk theatre, spoken word poetry, ballads folk songs, and so on) is a much more elemental feature of the human condition than any specific sports. The more proper analogy would be to sports *overall*. And while I agree that a country can have an outsize talent pool in Baseball, I would reject the idea that any country has an outsize talent pool in *sports*. Sportive activity takes a million different shapes, but it's a fact of human life. Every society has sports, competitive as well as collaborative. Like every society has music, or every society has some concept of romance and courtship.\n\nWhether a country has a strong \"literary tradition\" in the western sense means mostly whether the country has a strong tradition in long-form prose (novels and such), and to a lesser extent poetry and drama. And that falls between the extremes somewhere. It's a more universal feature than Baseball, but less universal than \"storytelling\" overall, in the wider sense. It's also subject to a long list of factors such as literacy rate, average disposable income, social safety net, so granted, there will realistically be regions with an outsize presence, and I'll admit that Ireland probably is one. I'd still prefer to base this on more empirical data than \"number of Nobel prizes\" but I also don't want to go into a 12 hour research binge to find out how many novels were published per high-school-or-higher educated adult that lived past 50 in Ireland in the last 100 years vs. in India, much less get into the minutiae of which area on the globe belonged to which country at which point in history, where their education system came from, and... you get my point. So your point stands. Ireland has an outsize presence in western literary tradition.\n\nBut I maintain that the Nobel prize is a *horrible* metric to measure this by. And it is not beside the point or \"to be expected\" or \"par for the course\" for the Nobel prize to be eurocentric. I would be surprised if anywhere in the bylaws of the Royal Swedish Academy of Science it said that the Nobel prize was specifically to be awarded to Europeans who excel in their field, or anything remotely like that. They present themselves as the premier scientific and artistic award in the world, so they have nowhere to hide behind for their Eurocentrism. It should be a matter of self-respect that if you think you're all *that*, you obviously strive for balanced representation and no national / regional slant, and I'll forgive that they didn't do that until the 80s or so but they never, ever course corrected. So I have higher expectations than \"aw shucks, it's a European award, gonna go to Europeans a lot I guess\".",

We don't talk much, but I believe we have a more complete communion with one another than even lovers have.\n\n>We are two men, two minute sparks of life; outside is the night and the circle of death. We sit on the edge of it crouching in danger, the grease drips from our hands, in our hearts we are close to one another, and the hour is like the room: flecked over with the lights and shadows of our feelings cast by a quiet fire. What does he know of me or I of him? formerly we should not have had a single thought in common--now we sit with a goose between us and feel in unison, are so intimate that we do not even speak.\n\nAnd further, in the same scene:\n\n>In a half sleep I watch Kat dip and raise the ladle. I love him, his shoulders, his angular, stooping figure-and at the same time I see behind him woods and stars, and a clear voice utters words that bring me peace, to me, a soldier in big boots, belt, and knapsack, taking the road that lies before him under the high heaven, quickly forgetting and seldom sorrowful, for ever pressing on under the wide night sky.\n\nAnd my favorite paragraph:\n\n>Is my face wet, and where am I? Kat stands before me, his gigantic, stooping shadow falls upon me, like home. He speaks gently, he smiles and goes back to the fire.\n\n>Then he says: \"It's done.\"\n\nI'm sorry, but I know it's meant to say how intimate bond appears between brothers in arms, especially in a place as hopeless as the front, and Paul does say later that he feels more at home in the front than where his parents are. But if \"his gigantic, stooping shadow falls upon me, like home,\" isn't the most romantic thing I'd ever read, I don't know what is. The way the novel is structured makes Kat the most important figure next to Paul, and if you look at it from a queer context, it's even much more powerful.\n\nI'm probably reaching, and I wouldn't at all be surprised if the author didn't intend for there to be any subtext at all, but it's just another aspect from the novel that left me breathless, whether romantic or not.\n\nEdit: I didn't mean it meant 'less' if it was comradery and friendship, I meant it meant more powerful to me, specifically. Either way, it's still such a highly romantic and lyrical prose. An amazing read. ",

            "I think its just how love is. When you feel loved, it brings safety with it. The company of the one or ones who love you is home in itself. Its why a child gets homesick and frantically wants you to come get them at night on a sleepover. Because for all the kids and giggles and laughs in the world. There is nothing like the love and safety of home.\n\nIn a situation as extreme as constant danger at the front. You take your home where you can. Your mind grasps for it. If you develop that brothers bond with the soldier next to you, then he becomes your loved on, safety and home rolled into one. You fight against all odds, to save him and keep him safe. Its not about the country, your beliefs and all that lofty stuff. You can stand up and fight, survive just horrible constant threat, living on the edge of what your body can handle, because of the man next to you. You fight for them. You are generous with them. Perhaps you recognise the strength in them, that holds you up as well, and know they know it in you too.\n\nI dont know if this still exists in modern warfare, which is also more remote. But back then in the Woods of the Ardennes or the trenches in ww1 - Im certain it was the brothers beside the soldier, that made him go on. That kind of love we might feel as kids, so certain and sure of the people with us. Maybe they find it in the guy next to them. Its nothing like romantic love. It doesnt have the luxury of bouts of drama and entitlement and petty squabbles.\n\nMens deep capacity for loving other men, - relationships between men as brothers and as friends who love like brothers, is really overlooked. I also think sometimes its imbued with a romantic love by viewers because we dont give men the space for a rich emotional life in our culture. Not the way women enjoy. I feel like mens emotional capacity for tender love and care in a non romantic way, is overlooked and undernourished in media and pretty much everywhere. Which I think is a shame. Its why its better in my opinion, not to arm those descriptions with any romantic or sexual or queer perspective, and just allow the man his love.",

Probably not.\"\n\n\nOriginal: Opinions will vary on whether this is a purely platonic love of one's fellow man, or whether it suggests or screams homoromantic love.\n\n\nMany will say, \"this is just about brothers in arms; not all affection between men has to be made sexual!\" However, I feel like the debate would be different if it were a man and a woman.\n\n\nThat's the real interesting part about ambiguously gay relationships in media. There's a double standard.

            "Definitely, I think the movie sort of missed the mark and focused too much on the \u2018bigger picture\u2019 when the book was specifically written to shove the reader into the shoes of a young man in the trenches killing other young men out of fear and desperation.

His friends are his home for all intents here. They're living in foxholes and mud and being shelled and watching each other die and suffer in horrific ways every minute of every day. There's a comfort and bond that forms between friends that's as strong or stronger than any bond you could have with another person.\n\n>I just don't understand how someone can read passages describing two men's physicality in such sensual terms\n\nI mean...it's not like he described his sweat slicked chest or throbbing penis or anything. I don't find the physical description to be all that sensual haha. There's certainly love there and a deep appreciation and comfort that they share.\n\nTo each their own though, if you want to read some queer romance in there and believe that Paul and Kat are secretly harboring romantic feelings for each other and casting longing glances and secretly holding hands in their foxholes in between scenes then it's certainly not hurting anyone. I just don't agree with that interpretation of the text. *And I don't think it's homophobic on any level to say that.*\n\nBooks are great like that though - different people will take different things away from them.

In many other cultures\u2014like German culture, for example\u2014male intimacy isn't considered \"gay\" like it often is in the U.S., and is sometimes considered a deeper bond than that between romantic partners. \n\nAlso, insisting on one interpretation of a passage is a close-minded, stupid thing to do. You should know damn well that literary analysis is subjective and often involves making associations that are specific to **your own experience**.",
            "I think maybe it would be easier to understand OP's point of view that the soldiers' love/care for one another is not at all homoerotic by using a the modern-day The Punisher series that went for 2 seasons on Netflix (with Ben Barnes as the bad guy).\n\nNowhere as poetic of course, but at one point Frank Castle is admitting to someone he trusts that, \"I loved and trusted and felt closer to all the guys on my squad than I ever felt with my wife and kids.

Now my family is gone and I have to find a way to make peace with how I felt closer to my battle buddies than my wife and kids.\"\n\nIt's not verbatim, of course. But its certainly not homoerotic.

But the sexuality spectrum in this discussion doesn't start with queerness, it starts with romantic love.\n\nLove comes in many forms, and only a relatively small number of them fall on the sexuality scale. I didn't understand that properly when I was young, but now I'm in late middle-age I don't see it any other way.",

            "Yeah. I liked the movie, but I really disliked how it turned it into a more grandiose story (especially the weird dip into a political thriller.) Or how >!Paul dies on the last day of war, in an exciting but stupid last charge,!< while in the book >!Paul dies on a completely unremarkable day.!< The whole point of the book is about how small these soldiers are compared to the raging war around them, and how their countries don't actually care about the myriad lives being destroyed every day. How there's nothing glorious happening--only immeasurable death. That these characters are just cogs in a machine, thrown away by the thousand.",

Hopefully some day when a gay man is mistaken as being straight, it can be felt similarly to a straight person mistaken as gay, stigma neutral. Like being mistaken for being gay itself isn't a bad thing could be a honest mistake and its the stigma that associted with it that makes it feel \"bad\" for us",
            "Since we are talking about a non-normal situation (i.e. two people in some of the most awful situations in history), applying normal criteria is kind of insane.\n\n(And in general reading male bonding always as homoerotic, well, there you got why a lot of heterosexual men do not express affection to their friends).",
            "Yeah, people really want to sexualize everything these days. Not all intimacy is romantic or sexual. The intimacy in these passages is about finding in someone comfort and security during a traumatic and frightening time. When I read \"his gigantic, stooping shadow falls upon me, like home\" it brings to mind security and strength. He may be exposed and vulnerable to the world, but next to Kat he feels a much needed sense of protection.\n\nIt's not homophobia to realize that this relationship described by a heterosexual man in the 1920s was not romantic, but about the extreme comradery of brothers in arms.",

They tend to be fairly open-minded and adventurous.\n\n\nI wouldn't feel confident saying, \"the author put this passage here to make viewers wonder if it was gay.\"\n\n\nIt could be that the author fully intends it to mean romantic love, but censored it a little by saying, \"it was like the way a man loves a woman, but totally not like that at all.\"\n\n\nSomeone with better knowledge of this book and author would be better able to answer without wildly guessing.",

I think I'll pick up another, lighter, book for his summer reading, give both and work from there.\n\nThank you",

            "I think their point is (logically and giving the benefit of the doubt here) that if we discount familial love, love is love. In queer spaces especially the line between \"best friend\" and \"person I want to marry and live with forever\" is often a lot thinner or nonexistent because I think accepting that there's not some sort of mile thick wall between friendship and the person you want to marry is much easier in a non-heteronormative situations.",

How the way we look at each other changes depending on the circumstance.\n\nI don't know how to black out the spoiler in my comment so..\n\nSPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!\n\nPaul and the soldier he was fighting with at the end had an atonement. They were fighting and trying to kill each other because that's what they felt they had to do, even if they didn't fully understand or agree with the reasons. But there was a moment where they looked at each other and realized....this is a guy just like me. Probably my age. Just as lost and confused, and yet putting his life on the line like me. And all it took was for a horn to sound and for someone to say \"it's over\" for the fighting to stop. One minute this is a mortal enemy, the next he's just a teenager like me. I think this moment shows how fickle a perception can be, and how detrimental the wrong perception can be.",

He feeds them, he helps them fix or improve their equipment, he teaches them to play cards\u2026he\u2019s Team Dad.\n\nEvery OTHER man fitting this description in Paul\u2019s life has failed him. His actual father fundamentally doesn\u2019t understand Paul\u2019s life at the front; he thinks the war is glorious and victory is around the corner. The schoolmaster Himmelstoss pushed Paul\u2019s entire cohort of boys into the army, where Paul has seen them die one by one.\n\nAnd then\u2026and then, there is Kat.\n\nYou interpret the scene as romantic, but with context it could also be paternal. A child waking from a dream to find a parent bending over them would also love and find comfort in the shape he made.\n\nTheir relationship is a lot of things.",
            "I was in the army. Never in combat. But I was in a joint training exercise in France where someone ficked up and we started getting shelled. 6 Dutch soldiers died because they thought it was all a joke and didn't dig their foxhole. So afterward I'm just sitting on the ground, not scared or nervous, just kinda unsteady a little. And the staff sergeant extends his arm and helps me up. His huge arms just honestly made me feel safe. I can't even remember his face, but I remember his arms. He had beautiful biceps. He just did.\u00a0 And there was nothing queer, gay or sexual about it. It was just a guy helping out another guy.\u00a0",

Statistically, there probably were gay men on the fronts who experienced the intense bonds just like their straight comrades, only with a queer element muddled in too\u00a0 (acted upon or not).

I don't have any studies off the top of my head but I also share your intuitive conception of the neurological underpinnings being more similar than we tend to think. Ancient Greeks drew all sorts of arbitrary boundaries in trying to understand the world, maybe erotic and platonic love are another example.\n\nThat said, I do wonder how incest factors in biologically because I feel extremely strongly that I would never want to fuck my family whereas with friends it's usually more just I don't feel any particular need to go there + all the societal obstacles.
