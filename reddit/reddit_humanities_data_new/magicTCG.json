        "content": "This is a place for asking simple questions that might not deserve their own thread. For example, if you have a question about a rules interaction, want sleeve and accessory recommendations, or suggestions for your new deck, then this is the place for you.\n\nWe encourage that you post any questions that you may have concerning Magic the Gathering here rather than make a separate thread for each question, though for now we won't require that you do so.\n\n**Rules Questions**\n\nRules questions and interactions are allowed to be posted here, but if you need an answer quickly it may be best to use a dedicated resource like the [24/7 Magic the Gathering Rules Chat](https://chat.magicjudges.org/mtgrules/).\n\n**Deckbuilding Questions**\n\nIf you're trying to get help with a deck, it is recommended that you post your decklist to a deckbuilding website so that it is easier to view. Some popular sites are Aetherhub, Archidekt, Deckbox, Deckstats, Moxfield, MtgGoldfish, and TappedOut.\n\nAdditionally, please include some description of what you are trying to accomplish. Don't just give us a decklist with no explanation, and don't ask extremely vague questions such as \"what cards should I add to my deck to make it better?\", because it's hard to give good advice in those cases. Let us know details, the more the better. Are you building with a particular strategy or theme in mind? Are there any non-obvious combo lines or synergies that people should be aware of? Are you struggling with a particular matchup, or are you finding yourself missing consistency in an important area, and need some help specifically for it? Let us know.\n\n**Commonly Asked Questions**\n\n> _I opened a card from a different set in my booster pack, is this unusual?_\n\nDon't worry, this is completely normal. If you opened a set booster, you have a small chance of obtaining a bonus card from a previous set. This is an extra card that does not replace any of the other cards in your pack, and is from a curated set of past hits that Wizards of the Coast has selected, which they call \"The List\".\n\nYou can view the contents of The List on Wizards of the Coast's official website. For example, the contents of The List for Streets of New Capenna boosters can be found [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/whats-new-list-streets-new-capenna-2022-04-14).\n\n> _My foil card has a shooting start symbol over the bottom left. I can't find anything about it online._\n\nAll old-bordered foils have the shooting star symbol. Most sites that display card images just overlay a generic foil graphic over all foil cards, which doesn't include the shooting star. Your card is normal.",

            "What type of slivers should I use? I've sent the giant list of lost popular ones on edhrec, but I'm not sure which effects are best. I'm running a [[sliver legion]] deck but only want 20-30 slivers in there. It's a multi tribal deck with a main silver theme. So which static abilities from my slivers should I be focusing on most? What's the balance of evasion and anthems and other stuff? I hope they makes sense",
            "Yes, assuming you flicker the saga while the final chapter ability is still on the stack. Once the final chapter ability triggers, it will resolve even if the Saga leaves the battlefield. And when the Saga re-enters the battlefield, it's treated as a new object with no relation to the one you flickered.\n\nWhat you **can't** do is wait for the final chapter ability to resolve, then flicker it. The Saga will be sacrificed before you even get priority to cast your flicker spell.",

Are people using magnetic fields to store their cards and I missed that memo or a hole in the ground an I also missed that memo?

Slickshot is the best creature in the deck by a significant margin. It's just worth noting that Electrostatic Infantry and Khenra Spellspear aren't *bad* cards. They're just bad in *comparison* to Slickshot.\n\nHell, people are hitting mythic with lists that include even the bad red-aggro cards like Phoenix Chick and Shock.\n\nBudget go brrr.",

            "Now that the big day has come and gone, we can finally share our wedding invitations with this sub! My husband and I are tremendous MtG fans (and in fact spent a great deal of our wedding weekend slinging spells with our wedding party, who are also our playgroup), so we thought it most fitting to celebrate our favorite game with our favorite people.\n\nI designed the booster packaging, card fronts, and backs (which are a nod to the anime movie Your Name - we walked down the aisle to Katawaredoki by RADWIMPS), and we worked with the folks at\u00a0[Board Games Maker](https://www.boardgamesmaker.com/)\u00a0to format it correctly. We made sure to include a custom Treasure token for our Magic-playing friends, though we knew a bunch of our family members might be left scratching their heads haha. We received a bunch of texts from friends saying they've sleeved the Treasure tokens and are using them in play, which is just the highest compliment we could be paid. We were both incredibly pleased by how it all turned out - the cards even smelled like a freshly cracked pack!\n\nWe sent these to our invitees in a green bubble mailer with cardboard backings so they wouldn't bend in transit, along with a customized note for each couple/friend/family unit. We were JUST on the cusp of the envelope counting as a letter, so we thankfully only had to pay extra for non-machinable mail!\n\nAll together, the packs cost just shy of $5 a unit to print (we made 65 of them), and about $2 to send. It was a bit on the spendy side for invites, but we were really happy that these set the tone for a relaxed, playful, fun wedding celebration.\n\nHappy to share any insights from this process for anyone who is interested in doing something similar! I had a ton of fun putting these together - I'd say designing these, cracking open the first pack, sending these to our friends and hearing all their elated and excited feedback was one of the best parts of our planning process. :)",

Very sorry you lost your chance to get drafting, that\u2019s got to be very frustrating.  \n\nI find that LGS websites are almost always outdated and clunky; I recommend calling stores directly on the day-of to confirm.  \n\nBest of luck next time!",
            "That's happened to me with a few different games, including *MTG*, and I refuse to go back to any of those places, even if it means driving twice as far to go somewhere with better business practices.",
            "That really sucks, I'm sorry. I'm also sorry that when I read your story, I thought 'instead of travelling ten miles to play magic, they travelled 50 years back in time to play pinball.'",
            "I'm gonna be 100%, why wouldn't you just call? You know that a new exciting set just dropped that is everywhere and you think a standard, somewhat boring set will fire first? I would have for sure called. Hell I call on regular fnm nights just to make sure so I don't waste my time.",
            "You could\u2019ve always called them",
            "Went in to my LGS, just come in on Saturday expecting commander . Played a bit of commander and there was MH3 draft 65$ NZ. ( Talked into it ) played it was on 9 people keen . So another one is planned sometime . At the LGS you\u2019re not the only one there . Sometime you have to be flexible.",
            "If only there was a device you could have used to somehow communicate with the store to make sure before you \"wasted gas\".",
            "This is illegal in a large part of the world",
            "Yeah sadly its gonna be a few more months till I get another Friday I can go. My work schedules are ROUGH.",
            "Ugh, I had this happen. I even called, and they gave the wrong times, and I missed a major event. I was pissed.",
            "I relate to that hard, me and some friends drove 3 hours to an RCQ that was listed on their website and had called ahead 2 days before. Unfortunately the employee just checked the website and said we were good to go, but the owner had moved the tournament to the next week, because they wanted to host a big Lorcana tournament that day :(\n\nSix hour drive to do nothing, wooo",
            "The place closest to me has its own website alongside both a Discord and Facebook page, and I still can't get reliable start times for events. It's rough out here, man",
            "If the price wasn't changed, I wouldn't care. If I went in and they said we draftin dragons maze, I would have been fine. I'm just not doing mh3. I already didn't want the cards, really. I just wanted to get out and do something fun. I don't play much magic due to work and life. My decks got banned, so I camt afford structured formats. I can't keep up the rat race for \"casual\" anymore. I'm looking into pauper for constructed as I just can't afford to play magic and I want to.",
            "I mean it obviously did. I turned around and walked out.",
            "Problem was they wasnt that they advertised an MH3 draft for 25 bucks, only for it to be 50 when you got there, they advertised a thunder junction draft they didn't have at all. So idk if that would even apply in this case",
            "Well in this case it's a different product thus a different price so",
            "Seems completely irrelevant. There werent enough people for an OTJ draft to run, they didnt change the price of it.",
            "It's like gonna be like 2 months from now till I even have a chance again:(.",
            "Basically, lol. I happen to have a pinball arcade in my area. It's not expensive. I'm not huge into pinball as I'm in my 20s. But I was with my dad, who loves magic and pinball, lol.",
            "Because I trusted the site listing? Why would I assume it's wrong. It's twice the price, so I think it's reasonable to assume some places are running normal priced drafts. When I looked online, lots of places were having Mh3, and I skipped them. Should I have called all of them to see if, by chance, they were doing something different than advertised?",
            "I shouldn't have to call. If you say we are doing x online why should I assume it's wrong.",
            "Why is an actual solution that is in op's possibilities downvoted so much?\n\nMy store always wants to know how many people will be coming in advance.",
            "Bro, am I supposed to assume that every posting is wrong?",
            "Can you name one place where having an incorrect calendar entry for an event would be illegal? Because as unprofessional and inconsiderate as a store doing that is, the idea that it might actually break a law anywhere is beyond batshit insane.",
            "Yeah... I used to be there, and if an LGS didn't have updated info, I would've just traveled for nothing :/",
            "Also I always thought Friday was a terrible night for it. \n\nI guess most people don't have free time Mon-Thurs but to me I have social obligations on the weekend nights.",

            "As long as it's not sanctioned proxies is your solution.",
            "It's bait and switch. We did consider playing just because WE COULDNT GO ELSE WHERE!",

            "Well, it was for Father's Day. I took him out to dinner. Then to magic. It sucks because I know he wants to play magic with me. He wants me to build another modern deck but at this point in my life I just can't afford it and I really don't get a lot of time off it sucks.  I spend everyone else's waking hours sleeping and work when everyone is free.",
            "Sadly this wasn't. This was a local gaming store chain. They said they tried to update it. It's just frustrating as I don't get to play much.",
            "As an Aussie everything they are saying is correct",
            "Yea bait and switch is definitely illegal most places. Typically laws require that be something where you advertised some kind of deal though, not just a thing that you ended up not having. If they had offered a $5 OTJ draft with the same price pool and then silently swapped it for full priced MH3 draft, *that* would almost certainly qualify. Granted, who is gonna go after a shop for that low a number, as much as we all kinda wish we could lol",
            "Yeah, I eventually learned that if I'm going to a place I don't already have an existing relationship with, I just need to call ahead. \n\nDid that a few months back, and it saved me a 30 minute drive to what I thought was the only store doing a modern event that night. Turned out no one was doing modern that night and I didn't leave my house and watched The Boys",
            "This doesn\u2019t help you, but makes me super excited that my shop is running our first pauper cube event next month!   I\u2019m always trying to get MtG stuff that other places don\u2019t do going.   So I\u2019m sorry you had a rough night, but you made my day if it helps.",
            "You wrote the word \"casual\", which shouldn't be sanctioned, and \"I just can't afford to play magic and I want to\".\n\nProxy a vintage cube or something if you don't have people to play constructed featuring proxies with.",
            "It's just 25$ more. And it's a rare dominated set more than others.",
            "This was something I said too! The packs cost double, but the prize money is unchanged. Is normally 15 is packs 10 is for the prize.... and it's 30 for the packs 10 for prizes... and 10.... well because we can!",
            "That\u2019s super fair, my perception is just probably just influenced by being an Aussie. We have extremely bulletproof consumer guarantees and this would absolutely qualify as a bait and switch [which is illegal here] while also being illegal on its own.",
            "Sadly, I did have an existing relationship with the chain. But I am also out of the scene things change, I guess.",
            "You're welcome, I guess. I just rarely get off days. Rough night. :(",
            "MH3 is indeed a fun set but yeah 50 bucks is just too much. I'm lucky that the LGS's near me are doing it for 32, because I think thats the highest reasonable price to pay for a draft. Especially considering you're in no way guaranteed to get your money's worth",
            "Yeah. I didn't even want the cards either way. And it's a pain to sell cards. And the store is only give a good price in store credit. So the 50 is gone even if I hit 35$ in cards. (Impying the other 15 is going to overhead and prizes)",
            "Yeah that's roughly what it costs in my currency as well so that makes sense"
