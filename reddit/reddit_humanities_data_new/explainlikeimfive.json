It's not really a policy I support so that would definitely be something to discourage me from getting involved.  \nIs this just some kind of limitation of Reddit's moderation tools or is there a specific policy reason for it? All traditional forums I've ever moderated would only ever mandate to delete posts or threads if the presence of the content itself was objectionable or offensive, not if the post was merely misplaced.",
            "I know it read it once years ago, but a refresher of the expectations of a mod would be helpful. I have general interest in helping mod a sub like this....but I'm worried I won't have the time to commit to the task.",
            "Hello,\n\nI can moderate, speak UK English, am slightly left wing but it is not obvious. Am generally OK.\n\n Oh, I am good at explaining stuff to idiots, forgot to say!",
            "[deleted]",
            "I hope that I will succeed with this. I am a little bit worried that I will be judged too much for past actions on this sub. I just want to let you know that I no longer wish to come across that way on this Subreddit again. I will be working hard to try and avoid any issues from now on. Thank you for your consideration.",
            "We pass over a few of those sort of applications every time. Every application gets carefully reviewed by multiple people. We then have a trial period after accepting them where new mods are watched closely (both to help them and for oversight).",
            "Thank you, we appreciate it",
            "Hi, we delete posts that break our rules rather than locking them so they don't \"clutter\" the sub and detract from posts that *are* appropriate for ELi5. We try to direct rule-breaking posts to subs that are better suited like r/answers, r/nostupidquestions, r/outoftheloop, or r/AskHistorians. \n\nOne example is the commonly broken \"search first\" rule. If we weren't deleting rule-breaking posts, there would be an overwhelming number of questions about, for example, stocks, the stock market, investing, etc. \n\nAlso, we try not to lock posts. A question may already have good explanations, but we try to leave threads open for other discussion and further explanation. We only delete posts that break rules.",
            "Volume context might also help, about 50~% (roughly 10k a month) of submissions break the rules and a far larger percent of comments. If the sub was half uninteractable content with no answers I think that would be a worse experience for most people",
            "Any time is helpful. We don't keep track of how active mods are as long as they're active at all, more or less. Otherwise, just be communicative with the mod team.",
            "Great, good luck with the form then and we will take a look.",
            "I mean we all can but that removal is there for a reason.\n\nWe require questions to be complex, its part of rule 2. So its assumed that the question asked is a complex multifaceted topic that requires thorough explanation. Generally speaking an explanation has 3 parts: a context, a mechanism, and an impact. Short answers give 1-2 parts and leave the rest to be inferred by the OP.\n\nIf you can give a full explanation in less space than the bot allows then the question breaks rule 2, and if the question doesn\u2019t then your explanation is very likely lacking.\n\nIt is one of our most accurate filters.\n\nAlso please do take a look at rule 4 just in case.",

Those *also* get deleted eventually, and that's just so much wasted effort.",

It is unfortunate and we hate to do so but if they break the rules then for the reasons already mentioned we have to remove them.",

The buss is modified to have a lounge like long seats, disco lights and absurd sound system.\n\nPrep for this month starts a year prior, these days, and carefully planned. With up to several pre-releases and a release of concept.\n\nThe whole tradition got messed up all sideways lately. Buss crews asking underage girls for sexual favours to be able to \"roll\" with the crew on the buss. Hard drugs being used by 18 year olds and often underage youth as well. Most of them are basically functioning alcoholics for the time period, with rational exceptions of course. There are often cases of rape, with it being filmed and spread on sosial media.\n\nIts fucked up, imho. It wasnt like this. There was alcohol and doing inocent weird pranks on each other, but not like what it is today.",
            "It really depends on where in the country you are and if you are part of a bus or not.\n\nI used to know someone that rented out sound systems to busses from the B\u00e6rum area around 20 years ago.\n\nHe charged something like 200 000 dollars for renting the equipment to one bus for 1.5 months. It came with a security guard that made sure the equipment was fine.\n\nOutside of the russ season he rented the equipment out to big concert arenas for bands like Ironmaiden and Rammstein, for a much cheaper price.\n\nMe on the other hand got the outfit, the business cards and some trips, probably spent about 600 dollarish on non alcohol related stuff.",
            "Imagine it is the last 3 months of 13 years of school and THE most important exams of your life to date is comming up rapidly. These exams determine if you get the grades to get into pre med or law or any other higher educations. Most would buckle down and study day and night. Norwegians though.... PARTY TIME!!! You then join a team usually red or blue and get into your chosen color jumpsuit and hat and you do challenges. Some of them innocent like wear a pyjamas to school. Others are more sinister like be drunk for 3 days, have sex with X partners, to the more problematic kidnap a russ on the opposing \"team\" (most times with concent, sometimes not...) or perform a stunt like \"hide and sleepover\" at IKEA. For completing these challenges you get an object in your hat like achievements for all to see. This though is not the main issue and is fairly cheap and traditionally a group of 4 or 5 Russ would buy a wreck of a old van and pimp it up. Team colors, art, group name and a few speakers to blast music all night long. This was usually not a huge cost, vans bought from the scrapyard and some paint was 2 grand at most but in the last 10 years or so there is a trend to forgo the shitty van and instead 15-20 Russ will buy a party buss (still from the scrap heap) with heavy metal concert level sound systems, dance floor and roofdecks and what not. Oh and a driver because you all are obviously to young to get a bus license and besides you all are drunk anyway. This can quickly add cost up into the 200-300k $ area and as the busses are leased from specialised firms at very sketchy leasing contracts, many Russ are stuck neck deep in debt after graduation. Because of laws, only one person can sign the leasing contract and is then finansially responsible. This makes them the chief of the group collecting money from the members. But every year there are examples of a group exployting or pressure someone into signing the leasing contract and then to bail on them leaving them stuck with the entire loan and this happens fast, 200k divided by 20 might be doable but if that goes down to 17 the cost is rising and it is a rat race to leave the group and the poor sod who signed the lease cant leave! And believe me he will not get a new group...",

Is that right?  It would seem weird.",
            "The lavish and expensive nature of it is mostly contained within the south, mostly area around Oslo. They get party buses with massive sound systems and customs songs for their buses, spending a million kr + in the process. \n\nUp north some people buy a junky van, give it a paint job and that's it. Most people don't buy anything apart from the uniform and cards. More modest, but still plenty of partying",

Final exams are from 19. may to sometime late june. (Atleast they were this year, trust me i would know)\n\nThe partying often starts a year earlier. Typing this from an afterparty where a group of \"Russ\" of 2026 launched their celebration. They mark the start by getting custom clothing and logos. \n\nPlanning of the russ-time can start as early as middle school in oslo. Thats 12-13 year-olds planning.\n\nA big thing the past 20 years is Russemusikk = Music made for the groups. Big name artists will make a generic song with dirty lyrics, sell it the group for anywhere between a couple of hundered, to tens of thousands of dollars. No, the group doesnt get any royalties, at all.\n\nVery very few groups spend less than 1000$ per person. Its common in Oslo for the big groups to spend tens of thousands each to pool together for a bus.\n\nRuss is not a new concept, its been around since 1905, but the traditions have changed slightly. This isnt some new flashy things the kids are doing. Pretty much every single norwegian alive has been Russ at some point. But there are discussions these days about how some of the norms have been taken to an extreme. There are a lot of drugs, hard partying, violence and sexual assault.\n\nIts too big to stop now, there is only room for regulation",

I mean, we did usually have a separate \"family\" party for a few hours on Saturday afternoon, but the rest of the time there was a just a communal party going around the clock for a few days.",

            "And the expenses are insane these days. Each buss also has to come with professionally designed logos, shirts, and a theme song commissioned from professional artists, based on the name of their buss. And as you said, they have multiple \"pre-release events\" where they'll hire a venue to host a party to announce their new name (or their \"cover name\", which is the name they'll use before they release their real name??? honestly I don't know what that's about), their logo or their song, which they also have to pay for.\n\nIn addition they have to hire bus drivers for the entire period. These expenses quickly rack up, and I've heard groups spending between 1 million and 3 million NOK ($100K-$300K) on the entire period, divided between the group, and that doesn't include expenses for alcohol... which is famously expensive in Norway as well.",

People are out of school and start doing other things, so they disperse a lot more than when still in school, so you start losing that communal feeling.\n\nAnd at least when I was young, people wore the Russedress (red or blue jumpsuit personalized with art/stickers/graffiti/pins whatever you want) wore them to school for several months the last semester. The really hard partying didn't start till nearer the end, but we still did stupid stuff together as Russ well before that.",

There are nationwide \"Russetreff\" where Russ from all over the country gather for massive parties, so having transportation you can sleep in is a bonus.

Often of the American teen movie style, then followed by a slightly shorter reverse drive dropping all the kids back off, with some staying together either for comradery, friendship, or to not wake their families.\n\nThe more hardcore ones end up being multi-day events, or whittle down into some of the more hardcore members doing smaller scale (but still easily 20-30 kids), partying till their bodies can't take anymore. That said though, it's not uncommon in Denmark to party hard literally till 7am, and then just keep going throughout the day with a bangin' garden party, or bodega (day bars) crawl, till everyone starts again.",

But at some point won\u2019t we completely run out of possible image combinations making them obsolete or is it something that regenerates a new site to QR connection? (On mushrooms so I might not have asked this very well lmao)\n\nBasically will we run out of QR codes and if not how is there an endless supply? ",
        "num_comments": 120,
        "comments": [
            "The thing about QR codes is they aren't just a short code that links to the URL, they are the entire URL. It's the equivalent of converting the URL into binary and then drawing the resulting 1s and 0s as black and white squares.\n\n\nTherefore as long as we don't \"run out\" of URLs we won't run out of QR codes.",
            "Think about a UPC code, those stripes you see on packages at the store.  How those work is the thickness of the stripe encodes information, black lines are 1 and white lines are 0, so the computer scans it and sees something like 0001010100010101010110111010100101.  That's just a number, and computers are good at taking numbers and looking on a list to see what the number is for.\n\nThe QR code is like a two-dimensional version of that same thing.  Because it's 2D, they can pack more 1s and 0s into the same space, so it can include letters and other stuff instead of just numbers, which is why it's used instead of a really long bar code.",
            "QR code is more of an font than anything else. It doesn't link to anything. It's just a text written out in this specific \"font\". \n\nYou can use QR codes for many different things than just urls. You can have ones with text, image, game,....\n\nYou can fit in them about 4296 alphanumeric characters, so that should give you a lot of combinations.",
            "So one thing to keep in mind: QR codes are just a way of writing something (such as a url to a website) in a way a computer can easily make sense of it reliably. That is to say, QR codes are not \"linked\" to anything, they're just a different way to write. You can use a QR code generator yourself to try it out and note same input always gives same QR code.\n\nNow to answer your question, QR code combinations, that is to say, all the ways we can arrange the black and white squares to make unique messages, depending on standard, amount to more than there are atoms in the universe, so, in theory yes, in practice no.",
            "The most primitive QR code standard has 10^132 possible combinations, which is 10^52 times as many atoms in the observable universe. Since then, we have upgraded the standards to hold much more data. We will never run out of combinations.",
            "QR can store arbitrary information. Small black squares represent 1, white squares 0. This way you can directly construct binary numbers from it. These binary numbers can be a text (see ASCII table that converts 2 digit hex number - which is 2x8 binary digits - to a single character like 'a' or 'X'). That's how you can encode an URL or any other text into QR code.\n\nHowever, you and me, we can create our own system, e.g.:\n\n0000 ...hello  \n0001 ...something bad happen  \n0010 ...I will come to you  \n0011 ...do nothing  \n0100 ...how are you?  \n0101 ...good  \n0110 ...bad  \n0111 ...afraid  \n...etc.,\n\nand then we can encode a message (one or more of these) into one QR code. So - we can create an app for us that will take that text, convert it to those numbers & those numbers it will put into QR code. On other phone, the same app could scan the QR, get those number from it and then convert those back to the original text.\n\nQR codes can be big and store a lot of information. See  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR\\_code#Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code#Design)\n\nInteresting thing is also that QR codes are immune to damage or imprecise reading by the camera. Simple idea behind error correction codes is that you put there some additional information that helps in guessing what was the original, i.e. let's encode just two words: \"yes\" and \"no\" like this:\n\n00000 ...yes  \n11111 ...no\n\n...then the message:\n\n00100 00001 00111 11110 01001 10111\n\nwas probably \"yes yes no no yes no\". If you receive e.g. \"00111\" it is more likely that it was \"11111\" than \"00000\".",
            "QR codes are just zeroes and ones, black and white that can be converted from binary to text. You can cover up some of the code because some of the bits in the image are for redundancy and you can use some fancy math to fix the code. There are different sizes of QR codes so you can fit more content in them.\n\nIt is basically just the link or any other piece of text as ones and zeroes plus some extra to repair the text.",
            "Answering the \"can we run out of qr codes\" part.\n\nCould we? Yes. How many combinations are there? Yes.\n\nThere are bigger qr grids, different encoding methods, different ways to do error correction... So you can create different qr codes that contain the same data after coversion.\n\nThere are also useless qr codes: like creating a code for the text AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. So there are millions of qr codes that are already wasted.\n\nOr unreadable codes, imagine a checkerboard pattern. You can't read that (even if it had eyes and the 010101010 connecting lines between the eyes. Yes all qr have, by definition, lines of alternating black and white dots between the \"eyes\" of the code). A checkerboard pattern wouldn't have a header to tell the size, encoding and error correction used. There a million of patterns that would not result in a complaining qr code.\n\nYet, there's still millions of ways to create different URL addresses, presentation cards, mail addresses, WiFi info and all the other stuff a qr can contain like, even a game... https://youtu.be/ExwqNreocpg",

            "Can we ELI5 what happens inside your phone when you open your camera app and it suggests the url? It\u2019s a computer vision problem essentially. But it\u2019s presumably looking for the corners and then determining the \u201cbits\u201d within that frame. Is there more to it?\nDoes every phone use the same CV algorithm?",
            "QR code is simply a \"pixelised\" version of a string of characters.\n\nBasically you start with the string you want to put: HTTP://REDDIT.COM then convert that into binary. To do so, you use the [ASCII table](https://www.asciitable.com/). This is a standard dating from the early computers that map each characters to a number. The result would be: 01001000 01010100 01010100 01010000 00111010 00101111 00101111 01010010 01000101 01000100 01000100 01001001 01010100 00101110 01000011 01001111 01001101.\n\nYou then add some more zero to fill up the space for the desired QR code size. You can't have unused space, so you fill it up.\n\nThen you take that, and encapsulate it into the QR stuff, which add some more informations and length and also some error detection and recovery data. The error recovery and detection stuff add more bits that allow to detect and fix some of the errors. It do so by adding some redundant data and some cleaver stuff.\n\nNow, you pass those 1 and 0 into some encoding scheme. Basically what it do is prevent too many of the same value to be in a row, for example (not sure of the exact encoding), it can say that if there is more than 3 of the same values in a row then you invert the next bit. So if you have 1111000 you get like 11100010. This prevent a long space that is all black or all white and help to figure out the bits.\n\nAnd finally you generate the white and black dots, with the QR decoration stuff in the corners and center. The decorations in the corners are to identify the orientation of the QR code, so it read it the right way. Also, the decoration in the center actually destroy some of the data in the QR code, but that data is recovered via the error detection and recovery mechanism. It therefore reduce the reliability of the QR code, but since it work many do use it. It just mean that damage to some other places in the code will probably make it fail to decode, while it may have been able to be recovered if that center part was not there, as it would have more recovery data present.\n\nSo will you run out of QR code?

Every IPv4 address is a combination of exactly 4 numbers between 0 to 255, so there are exactly 2^32 IPv4 addresses available ever, so it's easily possible to run out of IPv4 addresses. In fact we've already reached the point where there really aren't enough of them and we've had to start using different hacks and workarounds to get things to work.

People want more space, more speed, less maintenance headaches (my new car has laser headlights that should last more than 10 years, my 1993 dodge had headlights that lasted 2, but were 1/10th the price or less). \n\nI don't have time to look for a source, but years ago Tata made a car in India for 1500 bucks. It was... A car.  That occasionally caught fire, but was cheap.  To make it safe enough to sell in North America would have increased the price to something like 15k. You can have cheap, or you can have safe. Regulators have generally settled on safe.  The EU values pedestrian safety more than the US, but since the big manufacturers want to make the same car for all markets those benefits tend to be spread out pretty well.",
            "A lot of technology has become cheaper because mechanical parts have been replaced by computers.\n\n\n\nFor example washing machines used to have this long complex system of cams and switches to control the program (it was attached directly to the control dial which is why it would turn as the program ran). Carefully tuned electromechanical parts = expensive.\n\n\nNow you just throw a 5 cent microcontroller and some relays in there and you're done.\n\n\nCars with internal combustion engines are full of dumped mechanical parts that you just can't get rid of, so they will always have a price floor because of that. Add to this increasing safety and emission standards and the price stays high.\n\n\nWith far fewer moving parts electric cars have the potential to be cheaper, but the material that the giant batteries are made of is expensive keeping the price up.",
            "They do, but they also have to appeal to what consumers demand. The initial tooling costs are high on a new model, depending on how many things are designed specifically for it vs being shared among sister models and brands. They have to hire whole engineering teams, have to do testing, have to throw thousands of pounds of materials from plastics to aluminum to steel to cloth together, and have to generate a profit after the manufacture and assembly of thousands of parts, with some respectable percentage of these parts mandating precision and plenty of machine time which drives costs up.\n\nOne of the cheapest new cars right now is the 2024 Mitsubishi Mirage ES, at about $17K MSRP. And even then, on one of the cheapest brand spanking new cars on the market, the demand for creature comforts means including power windows, running ducts to the back for HVAC, steering wheel buttons, keyless entry, a radio complete with 4 speakers and Bluetooth, 12V outlet, USB outlet, a 6-way adjustable driver seat, and a split rear seat that folds down.\n\nThis is in addition to things that are required by law, or to meet standards, or as part of the sales pitch regarding safety. A bunch of air bags, ABS, rear door child locks, a LATCH system, TPMS, 3-point seatbelts. It also has to hit certain MPGs both as part of the sales pitch and to help the manufacturer meet CAFE standards, and this means a more advanced engine design. More valves per cylinder, VVT, advanced electronic engine/powertrain control, an electronic throttle body to allow governing and simplified software-based cruise control, on and on.\n\nAnd this is just the base model, and while these features often have software involved in them these days, there is a physical component to every single one as well, and is not purely a software feature. The software itself also costs money to develop, of course, though I'm disregarding that as a one time cost we can include with the above-mentioned engineering team.\n\nThey could be cheaper without all this stuff in terms of upfront cost, but the law and the market demands most of it which counters a lot of potential savings.",
            "Imagine if we artificially inflated the prices of TVs coming from China / India / South Korea (using tariffs) until it was actually cheaper to buy ones made here. And then we legislated the role of special TV dealerships, which operated independently and (by design) needed to be taking their own cut on every TV sale. Then we built up 80+ years of well-meaning regulations for how TVs must be built, effectively making it borderline impossible for new TV manufacturers to get off the ground.\n\nIf we did that, the prices of TVs would rise faster than inflation, too.",
            "Car *standards* have risen considerably over the years. For example, backup cameras weren't required in new cars ten years ago. Airbags weren't mandatory in the early 1990's. Lane departure warnings and similar are even newer requirements (google says 2022). All of those features require new systems to be added, and it all adds to the cost. Many of these features *used to* be add-ons that you could get with higher trim packages, but are now in all cars, raising the base price.\n\nAdditionally, some of the materials in cars can be quite expensive. You may have heard about catalytic converter theft becoming a bigger issue - it's because that particular car part contains platinum, palladium and/or rhodium.",
            "Those of us who grew up in the 1970s witnessed technology creep firsthand. In 1975 only fancy cars had automatic windows and power steering.

Airbags weren\u2019t in any passenger cars, crumple zones hadn\u2019t been invented, etc. \n\nIgnoring everything other than safety features and in-vehicle entertainment (Bluetooth, satellite radio, etc), you\u2019re still talking about thousands of dollars of technology. Having totaled both a 1981 pre-airbag car and a 2005 post-airbag, post-antilock brakes, post-crumple zones car, trust me, be happy the more expensive safety features are installed.

            "It's really weird to see so many answers where people try to make up actual reasons all the way to \"metal is expensive\", while the truth is that the automakers have made sure, through decades of lobbying, that cheap cars are simply legislated out of the western world. Have a look at India, they do have massively cheap basic cars.",
            "Because companies have to make more in a three month period than they did in the last three month period",
            "Mainly because cars keep getting more complex.  Though in the future Electric Vehicles are going to reduce cost of cars again due to being less complex.  \n\nIn the early 1970s cars had no air bags, automatic braking systems, emissions controls, and many other safety systems were non existent.  In addition the cars had no fuel economy requirements, so the engines in the cars were very simple and easy to make.\n\nOver time as cars became safer, faster, and more efficient - more parts and higher tech parts were required and added.  This added a lot of cost per car.  Cars also last a lot longer today than before, which is achieved with higher engineering costs.\n\n(Not exactly ELI5) - There are a lot of other reasons besides these, including the slowing pace of innovation due to the outsourcing of engineering by the big automakers.  Small suppliers can innovate, but they only work at the \u2018part level\u2019, and not across entire systems in a car.  To get bigger innovation and cost savings the automakers need to get competing suppliers to cooperate, and that is challenging.  A good example of long term stagnation in this area is cars still operating on 12V electricity instead of 48V.  (Can explain more here if anyone cares). \n\nLooking forward, EVs will reduce costs again as EVs have about 40% as many parts as a gasoline car.  EVs are a bit expensive today due to relatively low production numbers compared to gasoline cars.  EVs have improved greatly in just the last 5-10 years in terms of cost and range.",
            "If cars had stayed exactly the same, then the cost of production would come down and cars would be cheaper\n\nBut cars have not stayed exactly the same. Cars have improved *enormously*\n\nThey are faster, quieter, more fuel efficient, far safer, have much more technology, are more reliable, have lower tailpipe emissions, rust a lot less (if at all), and have many more improvements.\n\n[And yet adjusted for inflation, the price of a 1983 Toyota Camry is very similar to the price of a 2025 Toyota Camry](https://www.theautopian.com/the-2025-toyota-camry-is-barely-more-expensive-than-a-1983-camry-how-much-better-is-it/)\n\nBut look at how much better the 2025 Camry is compared to the 1983 Camry.\n\nThat's where the technical advances have come : making you a MUCH better car but keeping the price (adjusted for inflation) approximately the same.\n\nAnd if tariffs were not added to cars that are built in certain overseas countries, cars could be cheaper still.",
            "There is a lot of really good info here already and all of it is right, but one thing I\u2019m not seeing called out is the difference of scale between electronics and car manufacturing which is a major reason why electronics see big decreases in costs. \n\n2023 US vehicle sales were estimated to be [15 million units](https://www.statista.com/statistics/199983/us-vehicle-sales-since-1951/). Conversely TV sales were estimated to be [47 million units in 2020](https://www.cta.tech/Resources/i3-Magazine/i3-Issues/2021/May-June/Record-Television-Shipments-in-2020-TVs-remain-the) (I couldn\u2019t find a more recent number). So TVs are doing 3x the volumes of cars just in the US. Now consider that the best selling model in the US in 2023, was the F150 with roughly 750,000 units sold. It\u2019s available in 5 or 6 different trim levels with different interior options and features. So ford may only end up with 100,000 of those being spec\u2019d with something that cost them millions and millions to develop (think self parking features and \u201csmart\u201d cruise control). As a result to get the necessary ROI on that R&D they have to charge for it and a bean counter has to decide how many they think they will sell with that feature and how much the feature will cost to support the required return.",
            "We made cars vastly more reliable, packed with features that occasionally get used, cars are larger and that consumes more raw materials, and regulatory requirements pack on bill of material cost. It is estimated that up to 25% of the cost of a new car is driven by mandated features and design requirements.",
            "Part of it is because the \"savings\" are plowed back into features and improvements: cars have touch screens and amazing sound systems where they didn't before. Those are cheaper than they would've been, but the sound system before was a simple 4 speakers. Cars are safer than they used to be, etc. etc. They price has gone up, but so have the features and 'value' for that money \n\nAnother part of it is that not 100% of the car is getting those cost decreases. There's still just a lot of steel and rubber and human labor, and on THOSE component costs are going up not down",
            "Cars are really big chunks of metal. There's only so much you can do to make large chunks of metal cheaper to produce.\n\nWe already went through all the rapid growth and development in mass production steel.

So even if these things get cheaper, they'll just put in more because they can afford it.",

Tough shit, rules say you have to have them and you are paying for them being there.  \nMost customers and manufacturers would probably like to be able to make a 1990s car just with newer materials, 5 NCAP stars and more automated manufacturing and that car would be very cheap and would have all the shit people actually care about (AC and electric windows), but rules say you cant make that car.",
            "just to add to this answer:  \nwe could make something similar to Model T for much cheaper than $4500. Actually, you can order such from China even cheaper.  \n  \nWhy cars are more expensive then? Because we want so much more from cars now.  \n  \nFirst, let\u2019s start with engine - back then, 45mph was top speed, but usually cars did travel about 20mph. Engines did break often. And they had terrible fuel efficiency, terrible exhaust. Cars had few hundred kilograms and even that was a challenge uphill for a cars. Now we don\u2019t want just an engine that can do 80mph. We want engine that can do 80mph uphill, with 0-60 not in 15 seconds, but in 6, in a car that weights 2,5 tons and to have comparable fuel consumption to original Model T. That kind of engine is much much more expensive. Oh, and reliability - we want our engine to last 100k miles with almost no maintenance and to last at least 300k miles before it completely breaks down. Back then, 100k miles would mean motor is completely rebuilt.\n  \nSecond, continue with safety. Back then, few hundred kilos of car traveling at 20mph wouldn\u2019t cause some massive crash. Now, cars are several times bigger and traveling at 4x speeds - 4 times speed equal to 16x more energy, combined with higher weight that is 30-60x more energy in crash back then. And preferably, we would like to survive. A ton of engineering and added weight goes to this. And also to bigger and better tires and steering, as you want to be able to maneuver such massive car in such high speeds.  \n  \nAnd we want our cars to be more spacious. Cars are bigger than ever on average. A lot more cargo, a lot more legroom. Not just added weight, but every component has to be bigger and sturdier to hold such weight.  \n  \nAnd lastly, we want comfort. Quiet, smooth ride, so massive suspension is needed, climate control which also adds weight and ton of sensors everywhere, either to increase reliability, fuel consumption or comfort.  \n  \nSo you want maybe 5x more materials per car, much higher quality materials, hundreds times of more engineering, much much more complex parts - if you wanted to build such thing back then not only would it be impossible (due to lack of computers and material science), but even what was possible would probably costs millions of dollars per car.  \n  \nSo the prices does go down. But we add new features, or better performance/confort for the same price, instead of lowering price.  \n  \nCar from 1900s and car from today is as far as if you asked in a hundred years, why personal spacecraft is more expensive than car is today.",

            "1.  Firstly, it'd require all countries (and their politicians/leaders/kings) to agree to one currency.  Then the question arises: what currency will they use?  Why should the Chinese use USD?  Why should North Korea think all this is nothing but an American plot?  Why shouldn't Islamic countries say that Christian currency doesn't adhere to Islamic values?  You get the point. \n\n2.  How will a country convert to the common currency?  Will you base it on prevailing exchange rate?  If so, countries that are poor now, but growing fast will suffer.  If it's based on purchase power parity, large populous countries like India and China will suffer.  Basically, nobody will agree to a meaningful conversation rate (because it's complicated) \n\n3.  Trade between countries today affects the relative exchange rates between their currencies.  Moving to a common currency will significantly hit export oriented countries like China, India and USA.  So they won't agree to a common currency.\n\n4.  Money as a behavior modifier:  Powerful countries like USA use their dollar value to impose sanctions on misbehaving countries (like Russia right now).  Using a common currency removes this incredibly powerful lever, or makes it vastly complex.\n\n5.  There's no value to a common currency.  Whatever you can do with a common currency, you can already do with individual currencies.\n\nEurope was an incredible rare case where you had group of countries that were all small, politically stable, financially stable and rich (through slave trade and colonization, but let's not go there now).  They also have common political values and common enemies.  They've been cooperating on mutual defense for hundreds of years (individual countries, although not collectively).  They've been cooperating on mutual defense recently as NATO for the entire continent.  So merging the currency was relatively simpler.",
            "Monetary policy is generally best determined at the country level, and a large group currency like the euro comes with some huge downsides that are not always apparent right away. \n\n  \nWe saw the big downside of a single currency when Greece had financial issues years ago. If Greece had its own currency, the financial crisis would have weakened the it's currency relative to that of its neighbors. While this isn't great, it acts as a sort of cushion. A weaker currency means that exports are cheaper. This means that as a country gets in a worse financial position, other countries want to buy more of it's goods, helping to raise the economy.\n\nWhen you have single currency, the whole eurozone changes as one. This means if one eurozone country has issues, there is no way cushion, and downturns will be worse. \n\nOn the opposite side, a single country gives huge benefits to stronger economies like Germany. Normally, if your economy is very strong, your currency will strengthen and decrease your exports. But again, even though Germany has been doing well, that natural swing in relative currency values does not happen.\n\nThus, you can kind of think of a single group currency as almost a wealth transfer from the poorest countries to the richest countries in a way that makes crises worse.",

            "Oooh, this is pretty tough to do ELI5.  But I'll try.\n\n# Money is a store of value\n\nMoney is simply a store of value.  For many people it's just a way to say \"I worked this much, creating X value.  I don't need to use it right this second, but maybe later.\"  Or perhaps you took a risk on something and it worked out creating Y value for the rest of the world, but again: you don't need it right that moment.  So you need a way to store it.\n\nIn this way, no organization can \"create\" money, because it comes down to what everybody just accepts as having value.  Rare metals were pretty good, because -- you know -- they were rare.  Governments were able to tie into this to offer their own currency by promising you could get that much gold for this coin or that flappy piece of paper.  Once people accepted a currency as having value, then the connection to gold was eventually dropped (making a certain kind of person very upset).  Now countries will use an established currency, like the Dollar or Euro to establish value for their own currency until it is accepted as its own value store.\n\nIt's sort of like a chain of trust.  I trust gold.  You linked your currency to gold?  Great, I trust your currency.  Oh this other person linked \\*their\\* currency to the one I already trust?  Great, I now trust their currency too.  And as long as that trust is not violated, eventually each link can stand on its own.\n\nSo the UN cannot just declare it has a currency.  Somehow, it needs to tie into something that has accepted value until the UNBucks^((tm)) are accepted on their own.  The Euro had to do this too.  We had a lot of years where people were using the Euro without even knowing it.  And then we had a good number of years where people used the Euro, because they were still tying it into a fixed value in their own currency (It took well over 10 years here in Germany to stop saying \"100 Euros?  That's 200 Marks!\"  20+ years later, some people still do it).\n\nSo all this leads to the following problem: what exactly should UNBucks be tied to?  The Dollar?  That would make the most sense.  Good luck getting China and Russia to go along, and that's 2/5ths of the Permanent Council right there.  And if you tried to tie in the Ruble or the Yuan right now, the Americans (and probably the British and the French) would immediately strike it down.\n\n*So Answer One:* The UN would never be able to agree on how to link UNBucks to an accepted store of value.

Third of all, this supposedly miracle solution has a quite big negative effect on import prices, which in the global economy make up a significant amount of goods in most countries.

            "Creating a single, unified global currency is a complex issue with many challenges. \n\nUsing your M&Ms analogy, imagine you have a classroom where some kids have lots of M&Ms, and others have very few. If you try to give everyone the same number of M&Ms, the kids who had a lot might feel like they\u2019re losing out, while the kids who had few might feel like they\u2019re finally getting a fair share. But the problem is, not everyone agrees on what\u2019s fair. Similarly, countries have different economic strengths and weaknesses. A single currency would mean that all countries have to follow the same economic rules, which might not suit everyone\u2019s needs.\n\nEach country likes to control its own M&Ms. This means they can decide how many to give out, how many to save, and how to use them to make trades. If there was one big jar of M&Ms for the whole world, who would decide how many M&Ms each country gets? This would mean countries would lose control over their own economic policies, like setting interest rates or printing money, which are crucial for managing their economies.\n\nDifferent kids have different ways of playing with their M&Ms. Some might trade them, some might save them, and some might eat them right away. Similarly, countries have different cultures, political systems, and economic philosophies. A single currency would require all these different systems to work together smoothly, which is very difficult to achieve.\n\nSwitching to a single currency would be like trying to get all the kids to agree on one way to share and use their M&Ms. This would involve changing a lot of rules and systems, which can be very complicated and might not work well for everyone. Some countries might struggle more than others during this transition, leading to economic instability.\n\nIf one kid in the class eats all their M&Ms and has none left, it might not affect the others. But if everyone shares from the same jar and one kid takes too many, it could mean there aren\u2019t enough M&Ms for everyone else. Similarly, if one country faces an economic crisis, it could destabilize the entire global economy if there\u2019s only one currency.\n\nSo, while the idea of a single global currency sounds simple and fair, the reality is that it\u2019s incredibly complex due to economic diversity, the need for sovereignty, cultural differences, and the risks involved in transitioning and managing such a system.\n\nBut what about the EU, you ask?\n\nRemeber: The EU is a unique political and economic union with a high degree of integration among its member states. The Maastricht Treaty, from 1991, laid the groundwork for the euro by creating both an economic and monetary union. This treaty established strict financial and economic standards that countries must meet to adopt the euro.\n\nThe centralized control offered by the ECB helps maintain economic stability and manage inflation across the member states. For a global currency, establishing a similar central authority would be extremely challenging due to differing national interests and governance structures.\n\nThe euro has facilitated trade and travel within Europe by eliminating currency exchange costs and reducing exchange rate risks. This has boosted economic integration and made it easier for businesses to operate across borders. But the benefits of a single currency are more pronounced in a region like the EU, where countries are geographically close and have strong economic ties.\n\nWhile the EU has managed to unify many of its member states under a single currency, not all EU countries use the euro. Countries like Denmark, Sweden, and the UK (before Brexit) have chosen to retain their own currencies to maintain control over their monetary policies and economic strategies.  Achieving consensus even within a relatively homogeneous group of countries is challenging, let alone on a global scale.\n\nThe EU's has mechanisms to support member states with weaker economies, such as structural funds and financial assistance programs. However, these mechanisms are not foolproof and have faced criticism, especially during economic crises. Extending such support globally would be even more complex and contentious.\n\nThe transition to the euro was a monumental task that required significant coordination and planning. It involved phasing out national currencies, updating financial systems, and educating the public. Implementing a global currency would be exponentially more difficult due to the sheer number of countries and the diversity of their economic systems\n\nThe euro works for the EU due to its high level of economic and political integration, shared governance, and regional economic benefits, but these factors are not easily replicable on a global scale. The challenges of economic diversity, cultural differences, and the complexity of implementation make a single global currency impractical.",

If your currency gets cheaper, then your exporting industries (including things that we don't think of as exports like tourism)  become more competitive. The part thats bad is that everything that you buy from outside the country becomes more expensive.\n\nBut why does this work? Mostly because people in your country are getting paid less (in terms of other currencies). Weakening a currency is a quick way for a country to say \"we are poorer than we used to, we might as well act like it.\" It applies to haircut to every contract / price within the nation's economy instantaneously. \n\nIts not perfect, but \"everybody's money is worth 20% less than it used to be\" spreads the pain around, and can allow a country to focus more on rebuilding and less on the political fights about who has to absorb the pain.\n\n(If this wasn't ELI5, we would talk about \"Downward Nominal Wage Rigidity\")",

Now, they all compete with each other for jobs. In normal times, they all end up charging clients $100/hr to work, and let's say there are enough jobs that each of them works 40 hours per week (or $4000 per week).\n\nThen let's say that Carl breaks his leg. He can still work, but he isn't as fast. Now instead of charging $100/hr, Carl really needs the work (for his medical bills) and is less efficient. So he starts charging people only $90/hr. This allows Carl to continue to be competitive with Aaron and Betty who are both better, but charging more. Now, Carl makes less overall (maybe $3600 per week) but he is still able to get jobs because his price is competitive.\n\nThis is how it works when countries have their own currency and price levels can adjust independently.\n\n  \nNow, let's assume Aaron, Betty and Carl all agree to charge the same price (i.e. have a single currency).\n\nNow when Carl gets hurt, he still becomes less efficient. However, since they have all agreed to charge the same price, a customer has the choice of paying Carl $100 for slower work, or paying the same price to Aaron or Betty the same price for better work. Obviously, customers will keep picking Aaron and Betty, and Carl will only get the work that they cannot do. In this situation, Aaron and Betty may each make $5000 per week while Carl only gets they jobs they cannot do, and so makes only $2000 per week. No one hires Carl unless they have to.\n\n  \nWhen Carl is hurt, he can't adjust his price to remain competitive with Aaron and Betty. Thus the single price (currency) ultimately makes the cost of his injury a lot worse.\n\nThis is how it works when there is a single currency.",

            "# Economies are not the same\n\nEconomies are all different.  Some depend on imports.  Some on exports.  Some on neither.  Some on both.  Some are expanding.  Some are contracting.  Some have oversold real estate.  Some don't have enough land.  Some are agricultural.  Some are industrial.  Some are financial.  And so on.  You get the idea.\n\nNow take Covid and the response to it.  This caused different countries to have unique problems depending on all those factors above.  One set of problems boiled down to either having too much liquidity (because they printed too much money to try to keep people from rioting) or not enough liquidity (because everyone got scared and sat on their money).  This is one type of problem that you can use monetary policy to try to fix, or at least make less bad.  Liquidity is too low?  You make money printer go \"brrrrr\" (for the over-5s here, yes: this is generally by increasing debt to increase money supply).  Too much liquidity causing inflation?  You tighten the money supply by any number of means.\n\nThat is great, but it means \\*someone\\* has to be making these decisions.  The more centralized this decision is, the harder it becomes to handle individual problems in individual countries.  Some countries are going to benefit a lot; some are going to hurt.  Someone else already mentioned that the Euro has had no end of problems with this, and they are right.  Oh, and by the way: who exactly is going to be calling the shots?  (The U.S. will, in case you really were wondering.  It would be the only way to get them in.)\n\n*So Answers Two and Three:*  \nHaving a central money authority means that some areas get preferential treatment and some just have to suffer.  \nTrying to figure out who gets to make these decisions is yet another political no-go.\n\n# Just one more thing\n\nWhile everyone is always quite clear on the advantages of a single system, many people are not quite as clear on the major disadvantage.  For instance, if some country...let's say Turkey for no particular reason...decides to go down a really murky and dubious economic path, they screw things up for Turkey.  Ok.  That's bad for Turkey, but at least everyone else has a little bit of a buffer.  Even if the U.S. screws things up, most of the world will take a hit but not completely collapse.  With our current system, we have some firewalls in place that keep one bad decision from bringing everything down all at once.  (Major simplification, but also mostly true)\n\nIf there was a single currency being run by a single organization, we are one bad hangover away from the entire world economy from falling apart, completely, all at once.  As far as I can tell, there is no solution for this, because the entire \\*purpose\\* of having a single world currency is to eliminate all redundancy.  That is the sales pitch.  But the big benefit contains the seeds of its own demise, and I have no clear idea how to mitigate that inherent risk.\n\n*So Bonus Answer 4:*\n\nA single world currency is risky as hell, and puts all our eggs into one giant basket.",

            "I really think this is where the US is headed. Every politician in Washington knows a deficit that's increasing by $1 Trilliion dollars every quarter is *completely* untenable. But almost NONE would dare cut Medicare or Social Security, which are the lion's share of the budget. Senior Citizens would destroy the politicians that did that, and they're the biggest voters. And nearly ALL voters would also retaliate if taxes were raised substantially enough to make a dent in the deficit. No politician would have the balls to raise taxes back to 30 - 70% like it was pre-Reagan.\n\nSo, devaluing the currency becomes the least-bad, bad option. Pay off the debt with cheaper dollars. The US's position as an economic and military power would be weakened, but not broken.",

            "The thing about that is though that many developing countries peg their currencies to more stable ones like the USD or Euro, thus essentially using thosebcurrencies.which provides them with price stability.\n\nNow unless we want to argue they're stupid, economically illiterate and don't know what's best for them, I think we should be pretty sceptical of \"optimum currency area\" literature.\n\nIt's also fair to note that most societies historically did not use fiat currency with free floating exchange rates, so we're talking about a relatively recent trend to begin with and using that as our \"default\" normal expectation. Even if there is a tradeoff, it's not at all obvious that this is somehow the very best system and is certainly not just some sort of \"natural\" system.\n\nBy recent I mean for instance in Europe free floating national currencies existed as the main method of exchange from the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1973 to the creation of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1979. That's a whole 6 years Europeans could tolerate free floating national currencies.\n\nSo again we must ask the question, are Europeans just economically illiterate and stupid, or does their experience tell us something, are their reasons they wouldn't want free floating currencies?\n\nNow as far as Europe goes, we could of course use the \"optimum currency area\" theory. Certainly Europe is quite fragmented into mostly quite small states so we can argue they're quite far from optimal markets in general and trade barriers, including currency risks are thus far more significant. In principle it has been proposed that having two separate \"eurozones\" could be \"optimal\" and balance the EU economy, but at the very least few people would _seriously_ advocate 27 national currencies.\n\nBut then we oddly seem to privilege political state borders in these analyses? Why is Germany one unit in such an analysis, might we not consider whether East Germany should use the same currency or not? What makes the United States an optimum currency area?\n\nFinally, currency is in a sense \"just\" currency. The economy is ultimately about actual production, competitiveness, etc. currencies do not magically solve underlying problems of countries. Changes in relative values if currencies as a result of capital movements can be helpful at alleviating issues in the short term (though they can also be dreadful and the cause of currency crises), but all this is kind of speculative nonsense on top of the \"real\" economy. All this means is that without a state currency, a state has to actually address the root causes of problems, which while it may be politically uncomfortable is certainly not the worst of incentives for politicians to have.",

How many Greeks speak German? How many Portuguese people speak Swedish?\n\n2) European welfare spending and taxing is by country, but much of US taxing and welfare spending is federal. So high unemployment in a country lowers the tax revenue but increases spending needed. \n\nThe euro crisis in Greece (and other countries) meant that Greece has to fund much higher support for the unemployed, at the same time their tax income plunged, which made their finances look even worse, which increased their borrowing costs, which meant they looked more likely to default. Which increased their borrowing costs. This forced spending cuts and tax increases, which shrank the economy, which made them more likely to default, which increased their borrowing costs, and this cycle kept going.\n\nIn the US, a state or group of states having an crisis doesn't have to fund much of its aid, it comes from DC.

The EU formally prohibits this kind of transfer (richer states don\u2019t want to bail out troubled ones) though this rule has been broken in the past, but only in times of extreme economic crisis (e.g. Greece). In the US this kind of transfer happens constantly and as a matter of course.\n\nThe two differences of degree are labor mobility and trade.
