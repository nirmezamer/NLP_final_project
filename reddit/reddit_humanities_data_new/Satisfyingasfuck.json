            "i took this from an Eli5 post \u201cThe short, unhelpful answer that a textbook would probably give you is that the atoms that make up pyrite lock together in a cube-shaped lattice, so therefore their crystals form cubes.\n\nWhile that is correct, it's not very helpful because atoms are tiny, and this cube is big enough to hold in your hand, how could such a nanoscopic effect possibly scale up like this?\n\nLet's say you had a bunch of toy cubes, about the size of common six-sided dice. Each cube has a magnet embedded in each face that allows it to snap-connect to any other cube if it gets close enough to any of the others. But the magnets aren't very strong ones. Let's also say you already had a huge collection of these small cubes already formed into a bigger cube-like shape, maybe, the size of a car. And finally, let's say that there are now a countless amount of these toy cubes just floating around in the air, bumping into things in random directions. What's gonna happen?\n\nIt's inevitable that some small cubes are going to bump into your big cube and stick to it. And they're going to snap perfectly into the grid when they do so. But, you gotta remember, these magnets are weak. It's possible that as soon as a small cube snaps into the grid, another passing by cube will slam into it and break it back off again. New cubes can only snap onto your big cube with a single attachment point. There are no nooks and crannies they can slot into to anchor them down better. Getting a new cube to stick to the outside and last for any duration of time is rare.\n\nOne of the small cubes could get lucky, though. It bumps into the big cube and snaps into the grid. Now that it is there, it has created four places on either side of it where another cube can drift by and latch in on two sides, not just one. Before getting knocked off, it could cause another wayward cube to snap down next to it. That creates 3 new spots where new cubes would really like to park. With each new cube you add, you increase the \"surface area\" of where more cubes can come down and join, which further increases the likelihood that they do. If this can build up to a critical point where it can avoid being blasted off by random chance, suddenly you have a runaway chain reaction where many, many cubes start locking into the grid, because those L-shaped nooks are such attractive places for them to be.\n\nThe result of this is that, if a new layer on the face of the big cube can last long enough to get started, it very quickly fleshes out into a full layer. You usually don't ever get partial layers formed, it's either the whole layer, or no layer at all.\n\nThat's the key to why macro-sized crystals form as big geometric shapes with such flat faces and pointy corners. They're formed layer by layer. Almost never in partial layers, but almost always only in full, complete layers. And if you only build shapes in broad, flat layers, then no matter how small your original crystal was, even atomic sized, it will scale up to be a sharp geometric shape.\u201d",

            "Roll a die, and whichever side comes up gets another layer on the cube.\n\nA layer of pyrite is only .1 micrometers, so there is around 500,000 layers on each side of each cube, which means you roll the dice 3 million times to build one cube.  With such a large number of dice rolls, we would expect the sides to be pretty dang close in size.\n\nAdditionally, if the crystal started to get out of whack and stacked enough layers early on to make it look like say a shoebox, that now means all the other sides have greater surface area than the ends.  This means that there are more places for a new layer to potentially start, making it more likely for one to form compared to the overly layered sides.  This provides a natural pressure for the pyrite cube to expand relatively evenly, even if probability is insufficient.",
