        "content": "First, sorry for the several re-posts, but reddit was not cooperating with me.\n\nInitial Review:\n\n* Main Switches are a bit heavy, but consistent in feeling and sound.\n* Side Switches are crisp and a bit loud for my taste.\n* Scroll Wheel Encoder doesn't have defined steps (if you need accurate steps I recommend a swap.)\n* Mouse Skates are not the great, will try Jade Speed Dots later for sure.\n* Coating is great, they state \"ice cold\" feeling, is not like that but I kinda understand it, it does not overheat your hand with prolonged usage, at least compared to my GPX1 is noticeable for sure.\n\nWill review in \\~2 weeks the sensor performance with in-game usage and overall status of the mouse also.\n\nFor now, it's a great shape, with excellent hardware specifications and lightweight.\n\nAll the bellow info is confirmed/measured by me:\n\n* **Weight:** 38.4g (No Skates)\n* **Skates Weight:** 1.8g\n* **Full Weight:** 39.8g (Stock Skates) **\\***\n* **Skates Thickness:** 0.81 mm\n* **Scroll Wheel Encoder Height:** 10 mm\n* **Sensor/MCU:** PAW3950 Ultra + N52840\n* **Main Switches:** Omron D2FP-FN2\n* **Side Switches:** TTC Mini (Brown Shell Blue Dot - 2 Pins)\n* **Scroll Wheel Encoder:** F-Switch (Brown)\n* **Battery:** 250mAh (3 Pins)\n\n**\\*** The 0.4g deviation is due to the central disk for sensor not being used and the adhesive that holds the skates.",
