The lions share of all municiple taxes is spent on the police, and its the mayors job to ensure the tax money is being alocated appropriately. So it seems pretty reasonable that the mayor would be in an officer position to them and have a requirement to be in attendance of such meetings lest the board run amok. Likely, they are working off of Robert's Rule, which essentially means the chair is just a facilitator of the meeting and only have power to ensure the meeting is in order. They typically do not have any real say or weight in the room other than to ensure order or cast a tie breaking vote. Then again, if you fuck that up you can be kicked out as chair and an election gets called. So my guess is he fucked up.",

In the backyard or out of direct line of sight for opportunistic thieves. Learnt the hard way when someone just picked up all my tomatoes in planters with an open yard.\n2. Direct sow your ornamental flowers. No guarentees they won't come back with a shovel, but it makes things harder to get at when seedlings grow root systems rather than transplanting. Plus it takes a while before the plant ends up flowering. Also grow them in clusters, therefore it's harder to get at one plant. I just sow wildflowers as my ornamentals and it's messy but pretty enough for no one to try to get at things\n3. Don't even bother with hanging baskets. Super easy targets\n4.
