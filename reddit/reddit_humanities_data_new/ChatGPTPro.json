        "content": "First of all, I'd like to preface this message by saying: Yes, I am aware that there has been a huge drop in the quality of posts these days and on behalf of the mod team (or lack thereof) I apologise for this. We have had issues recently wherein all of the mods' accounts got suspended or banned for unknown reasons. Because of this, there were no moderators to run the subreddit. Only my account didnt get suspended but I was inactive (for personal reasons) and lost most of my permissions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, after a (very long and gruelling) chat with the Reddit Admins, I have mod permissions again. So hooray, I guess.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext, speaking of low quality posts these days, let's set some rules. The following posts will be removed IMMEDIATELY:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Posts that link news articles, or promote news articles or newsletters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Posts that complain about GPT-4's output quality, this subreddit is for the discussion of professional usage of GPT, \\*\\*NOT\\*\\* complaining because the bot didnt give you exactly what you wanted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Posts that are very obviously generated by ChatGPT. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. The exact same posts about prompt engineering that keep popping up, as if we didnt have enough of those already\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. \\*\\*Any sort of promotional material. Zilch, Zip, NADA\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. Questions like: How do I voice chat with ChatGPT, What should I do if ChatGPT \\_\\_\\_\\_, Why isnt ChatGPT doing \\_\\_\\_. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n7. Crossposts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you disagree with the removal of your post, just reach out in the modmail. And if you \\*do\\* reach out in the modmail, don't straight up start cussing and complaining about the removal (This has happened too many times).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow that we've gotten that out of the way, now the issue of moderation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*As you can see, it's painfully obvious that the subreddit has grown exponentially while the number of moderators have dropped to literally one. Thus, I am now opening mod applications :D.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you do want to apply, DM me u/Redditoridunn0. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe subreddit is still growing quickly and there are \\*many\\* posts being put up in the subreddit that are either straight up dogcrap or spam. In order to be able to keep up with this and upkeep the high standards of this subreddit, I will see to it that we do get a good number of mods going in here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce again, I am \\*very\\* sorry about the huge quality drop and lack of moderation in this subreddit. If I typed something stupid in this spiel then forgive me, I have a headache and I thought typing this out while having a headache was a good idea (it very much was NOT).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Mod applications are a thing now, DM me if interested. Oh and bad posts go bye-bye.",

            "Happy to see this overall direction, as I joined this sub hoping it would be a place for people interested in the technology and how to get the most out of it. Unfortunately, it has been a lot of the same posts as the other related subs lately, which include the generic \u201cit\u2019s completely dumbed down now\u201d posts, the shills promoting their blogs/services/newsletters, and the kiddie edgelords that are like \u201ctee hee look I got it to say boobs.\u201d\n\nThat said, I agree with the other commenter that I hope the increased moderation doesn\u2019t go too far. Personally, I don\u2019t have a problem with links to news articles if they are germane to the topics discussed here, but they should at least be limited to legitimate news sources. But it\u2019s not my sub so I\u2019ll go along with whatever rules are provided and look forward to constructive discussion about GPT.",

            "I suppose point number 2 refer to one of my recent posts.\n\nI have a feedback: I think this approach can be devious, because complaining = asking for help actually. And r/ChatGPTPro is a place where people with a GPT PLUS subscription can discuss.\n\nFor instance, being able to insert a file as input in the prompt, is only available for paid users, which we are.\n\nNow for that particular post [https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/18svsiw/maybe\\_there\\_is\\_a\\_reason\\_for\\_chatgpt\\_reduced/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/18svsiw/maybe_there_is_a_reason_for_chatgpt_reduced/)\n\nI agree that there is nowhere where you can help the op (me) and tell him how he can achieve a result.\n\nWhat I mean is: if someone complains about something it should not be automatically be tagged as irrelevant and must be removed, instead if the user can be helped and can solve his issue that's a win for eveyone. He will help another person later.\n\nWait, the \"pro\" term is for professional not about \"gpt PLUS\" (aka pro?)",
            "Awesome I was initially excited about this sub, but been ignoring it as of late.",
            "Yay! I haven't been in the sub for a bit because the post quality was degrading pretty badly.\n\nSo very very happy to see this update! This is awesome, because I was scared that this sub would turn into the shitshow that r/chatgpt currently is.\n\nGood on ya, mate! Thank you for caring enough to go through the hassle!",
            "I love you",
            "Haha thanks! This was needed",

It has been 3 months since this has been posted and, correct me if I am wrong, I do not see changes that this posts implies would have been made.

            "I frequently get asked if I have an archive of prompts or materials. Under these rules am I allowed to respond to such with a link, or is that self-promotion?",
            "Regarding rule 1, wont linking some articles or tweets and discussion its implication be allowed? Like especially updated from openAi",

            "[removed]",
            "[deleted]",
            "I'd like to emphasise that the removal of posts about complaining apply to posts that complain about the quality of the output and not complaining in general. I do agree that not posts that have complaints about ChatGPT also ask for assistance in solving problems regarding ChatGPT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost of these posts that ask for assistance regarding GPT usually fall under the category of breaking Rule 2 (Relevance and Quality). In which, they're usually one sentence posts with basic questions that can be solved with a google search, at best.\n\nI'd like to emphasise that the removal of posts about complaining applies to posts that complain about GPT's output. If it is otherwise, then the post will stay up. This is done to prevent the same questions from being repeated over and over. In fact, we are planning to start a megathread for basic assistance and help with GPT-4, so keep an eye out for that\n\nr/ChatGPTPro isn't exclusively for GPT-4 users, but the content often leans towards it due to its professional applications in coding, data, statistics, etc. We hope this clarifies any doubts. If you have further questions, feel free to ask! :)",
            "What kind of time commitment is required to be a mod around here?",
            "Yep, I felt same way. Hopefully now that we have mods, this mod can be as awesome as it should be.\n\nI'm just glad it never got as bad as r/chatgpt is now! lol",
            "Needle thread? My guy did we read the same post lol \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to cut out the repetitive low effort BS. If you like that kind of thing, r/ChatGPT is thriving in that regard. Check it out",

            "In rare cases such as these, they will be allowed provided that there is no intention of self promotion (i.e. It doeant link back to your account, or it isn't owned by you).\n\nThay being said, using url shorteners like linkvertise is also not allowed, and if the website you link has one too many advertisements, it might be taken down too.\n\nTo be safe, we recommend you reach out to a mod if you wish to use external links in your posts or comments.  Whenever a comment or a post is removed, a removal reason WILL be provided. If you wish to dispute it, by all means, reach out to us in the modmail :)",
