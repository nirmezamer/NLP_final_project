            "Hi professor, I've always been curious about the emotional dysregulation aspect of ADHD. Is it more fair to say that sufferers have stronger emotions than average, or is it that they have more trouble with controlling those emotions due to deficits in executive function. Or is it that these two theories can exist at the same time? Thanks in advance",

Has it stood up scientifically?",
            "I am an adult female 36, recently diagnosed with ADHD. Started medication last year and have done a nose dive deep into ADHD research in that time. \n\nIt seems to be the common consensus with so many research professionals in science- that ADHD is very misleadingly named.  I wondered if there was any noise in renaming this disorder- or what do you call it exactly? \n\nIt\u2019s so dated- named when there was so much less known about it. So badly needs to be updated! Opinion on this? As Dr Hallowell says \u2018it\u2019s not an attention deficit, but rather an inconsistency of attentiveness..\u2019",

Caffeine seems to have a deleterious effect on mine personally.  I was diagnosed as a child and again recently as a 33 year old as inattentive ADHD.  We have come a long long way since my first diagnosis.  Never received any treatment until recently.  Treatment has changed my life for the better!  Thank you.",

Some say it\u2019s not real, childhood ADHD progresses into personality disorders which cause most of the harms and impairments in patients\u2019 lives. Some say it\u2019s not executive dysfunction, it\u2019s only focus/attention/hyperactivity. Others ignore PDs entirely and only focus on adult ADHD.",

I plan on asking my Psychiatrist more questions at our next appointment, I just got so overwhelmed by the diagnosis at our last appointment,  I didn\u2019t really have time to ask anything. \nWill I have to be on ADHD meds for the rest of my life?  \n\nAlso, there are all different kinds of behaviors that people attribute to ADHD, are they really \u201can ADHD thing\u201d?

I recently completed by doctorate in nursing practice and did my doctoral project on screening for adult ADHD in a VA primary care clinic, so I\u2019m very familiar with a lot of your work. \n\nWhen I was conducting my project, one of my main frustrations was the lack of understanding regarding adult ADHD in the medical community at large. Do you think healthcare providers receive an adequate amount of education regarding ADHD, especially in adults? Also, do you think there\u2019s value in screening adult patients for ADHD in the primary care setting? The impression I got through my research was that many patients with ADHD are likely undiagnosed or under treated for various reasons, but I know there can be concerns with screening if there are inadequate resources to treat the identified problems.",

I recently heard that something I've experienced since I was about 18 has a name and is one of the sleep disturbances often associated with ADHD: Intrusive Sleep. Just searching for intrusive sleep has only given me a handful of articles, and some articles based on those articles. Can you suggest any specific resources I can use to learn more about the phenomenon in general, and its involvement with ADHD in particular?",
            "Hello! I am interested in any correlation about the genes which are linked with ADHD. Are there any new findings and breakthroughs recently in research about genetical causes of ADHD? What functions and metabolic pathways does these genes tend to be a part of? Or does any non coding genome regions like lnc RNA and other non coding RNAs play a role in causing ADHD?",

            "Hiya, and thanks for doing this. Can you direct me to any papers/resources that relate to ADHD in high achieving teenage girls (or some part of that, e.g. girls)? \n\nI'm particularly interested in what best practice looks like in schools when it comes to pastoral support for pupils with both ADHD and a mental illness, but maybe that's too specific!",
            "Hello Professor, how would your describe ADHD to someone who thinks that everyone as ADHD at some point? (In one or few sentences).",
            "The International Consensus Statement concluded that most cases of ADHD are caused by the combination of many genetic and environmental risk factors. But what would these environmental risks be?   \n  \nFrom what I've heard previously, most cases (70-80%) are inherited while in the remainder there is no genetic risk but the individual has clearly suffered some neurological compromising event.",

            "Any thoughts on histamines vs acetylcholine and ADHD? \n\nWho besides Dr. Russel Barkley  and yourself would you recommend following for updates on clinical research or just general evidence based research and information regarding ADHD?\n\nDo you believe cognitive disengagement syndrome or sluggish cognitive tempo should be its own diagnosis? \n\nHow differently should ADHD inattentive be treated from other forms of ADHD?\n\nAny promising early research into new treatment modalities?\n\nThoughts on efficacy of peptides like Semax or Cerebrolysin for mitigating ADHD? There have been many successful human trials in Russia -on the one hand, it\u2019s Russia on the other hand, I don\u2019t see much profit in allowing the sale of these peptides, so I don\u2019t think there would be much chance of bad actors gaming trials.",
            "Fantastic! It\u2019s so difficult to work out one single version of the truth about ADHD as there is so much information out there. It\u2019s very hard to sift out the wheat from the chaff. There also seem to be lots of charlatans jumping on the bandwagon trying to get to make money out of what many misinformed people think is the \u2018latest trend\u2019. As a qualified psychologist myself (although not in the medical field) I really value being pointed towards evidence-based research and guidance so thank you sooo much for raising awareness of your work.",
            "How do you feel about computer-based tests for ADHD and their diagnostic worth? To the best of my research the only valid method I've seen is an interview, and I have known several people failed by tests with numbers or sounds and screens whose doctor use them as the only metric. Are there worthwhile tests, and if so in what context?\n\nI've seen Russ Barkley say tests aren't a good measure either but I'd like to hear what others think.",

Preferably a visual rather than completely written/spreadsheet.\n\nB) Potential co-therapies (common or uncommon) with some basic reasoning behind the combination.\n\nUnderstand that this is an ask, but would be really helpful for both patients and practitioners.\n\nThanks",

            "Hi professor, thanks for letting us ask you some questions! I am interested if you know anything with those with ADHD being more likely to develop long covid after an infection. I remember a clinic explaining there might be a higher risk factor for those with adhd because of how our brains wired thus when covid damages the brain it effects us differently. For example it common normies loose sense of smell. I know this question is kinda a stretch, but hoping you might know something!",
            "Thank you so much for your time and expertise, Dr. Faraone!\n\nI'm a late-diagnosed woman with autism and ADHD-C, diagnosed at 38 last year. Started taking Atomoxetine three monts ago by easing into it, and even in this short time it has become life-changing for me. I feel like I am, en passant, recovering from lifelong ADHD burnout.\n\nAs someone who was blamed for not living up to their potential (up until now :)), I have something akin to a remainder of misguided guilt about \"wasting my life\".

            "Got another question for you Dr. Faraone:\n\nThis one's kind of awkward, but it comes up fairly frequently here, so it'd be good to have a clear expert answer we can point to in the future. We occasionally see people claiming that masturbation worsens ADHD symptoms or can even have causal effects, and that abstaining from masturbation can reverse this. Does the research bear this out? Is there any known link between masturbation and ADHD symptoms? Does abstaining from masturbation reduce the severity of ADHD symptoms?",
            "Hello Dr. Faraone, thank you so much for doing this!\n\nTwo things I struggle with a lot are executive dysfunction and time blindness, especially in the context of the workplace. I have some \"strategies\" I set up to gamify the process for myself, but I find that over time they always eventually become ineffective since I can only fool myself for so long. Is there any research on effective strategies outside medication that are sustainably effective for ADHD adults in the workplace, or is there any advice you may have based on your studies?",
            "Greetings Professor Faraone!  \nThank you for your work and, more specifically, for doing this AMA.  \nI've collected a few questions, answer/ignore as you wish:\n\n-Are there any good predictors/correlates of medication response? As in, people with trait A respond better to medication X or people with trait B often don't respond well to medication at all?\n\n-What is your opinion regarding medication tolerance? Is it reasonable for people on stimulants to take drug holidays, even without any prior tolerance? Is there any evidence to assume that non-stimulant medications could lose their effect over time?\n\n-Are there any unintuitive symptoms of ADHD that aren't very commonly known, especially in the ADHD community? I recently learned that many people with ADHD have problems with auditory/speech processing, which I didn't think was obvious coming from the executive dysfunction model.  \n  \n-Are there any specific lifestyle interventions that you can recommend based on your knowledge/experience? I recently learned that listening to white noise can improve symptoms in people with ADHD, anything else like that?",

For example, I now have to contract my PCP each month, she has to submit a new prescription, I must refill my prescription within a date range, and my personal information is logged into a surveillance system. Is there any evidence that the more rigid, surveillance-based administrative processes required by stimulant medications negatively affect patients' quality and continuity of care or related outcomes? \n\nSecondly, are the processes of determining ADHD-related research priorities inclusive of individuals diagnosed with ADHD?\n\nThank you!",

When I finally managed to get myself to the gym and had a solid workout I felt clarity and amazing calmness.

Do you have some suggested reading to learn more about ADHD and eating disorder, autism and hoarding (not all 4 together LOL)? If you have any comments for coping strategies more unique to these combinations yourself, would love to hear them!",
            "Prof. Faraone, I have a pair of interrelated questions:\n\nFirst, could you estimate the proportion (e.g. as a range) of those engaged in ADHD research who themselves have ADHD? My anecdotal observation is very few people in the upper levels of academia or research (non-psych related) have any symptoms of ADHD, whereas it is possible to spot people with symptoms in say a community volunteer organization. But I'd wonder if there are more people within the world of psychiatry or psychology research relating to ADHD given the personal stake and the potential for their ability to possess deeper insights into the nature of the condition, whether through personal or interpersonal experience \u2014 again, genetic hence experience with family; socioeconomic effects sorting by class; and social effects given evidence that people with ADHD seem to aggregate either via preference or via exclusion.\n\nSecond, there have been repeated recommendations to have those affected by a given condition be involved in the guidance and design of research in order to improve the relevance and quality thereof, *e.g.*:\n\n> International government guidance recommends patient and public involvement (PPI) to improve the relevance and quality of research.  PPI is defined as research being carried out \u2018with\u2019 or \u2018by\u2019 patients and members of the public rather than \u2018to\u2019, \u2018about\u2019 or \u2018for\u2019 them ( http://www.invo.org.uk/). Patient involvement is different from collecting data from patients as participants.  Ethical considerations also differ.  PPI is about patients actively contributing through discussion to decisions about research design, acceptability, relevance, conduct and governance from study conception to dissemination.  Occasionally patients lead or do research.  The research methods of PPI range from informal discussions to partnership research approaches such as action research, co-production and co-learning.\n>\n> **How to incorporate patient and public perspectives into the design and conduct of research**.

            "I've seen the idea of SCT/CDS being susceptibility to internal distractions/mind wandering as opposed to ADHD as susceptibility to external distractions in the literature. However, I see a lot of people with ADHD who identify with the notion of being internally/mentally distracted.  \nWhat do you think of this model?",
            "Hi Professor Faraone! Loved reading your responses surrounding emotional (dys)regulation. What are your thoughts on how this factors into relationships? I really like your point on impulsivity. I often find it\u2019s hard to trust my emotions/feelings because they tend to appear firm and then waver unexpectedly.",

            "What is your view in the role of co-production, self advocacy and patient subjective experience in the design of clinical research? In particular do you have views on where granular analysis of self reporting of patient subjective experience meets the standardization of defined symptoms or pathologies?\n\nAn example that comes up in discussion in some settings (I work with an ADHD self advocacy charity) is the debunking of parodixical stimulant response. While medical evidence has shown the idea of a physiological paradoxical stimulant response in ADHD is bunk, the subjective experience of a paradoxical response to stimulants (from caffeine/nicotine to CNS medications) is widely relatable to a meaningful plurality of people with ADHD I work with and debate is had about whether it was thrown out on the lack of a physiological correlate with insufficient attention to potential clinical value of recognizing the reproducibility of the subjective experience.",
            "Hello Professor \nIn your experience can people who have too many side effects on stimulants, fare better on non stimulants? And have you much experience of prescribing or seeing good results in those who take a non stimulant such as Atomoxitine alongside small dose stimulant such as Ritalin?",

How could you tell them apart?",

I'd like to see more research that tells us about shared causes and helps us understand the implications of ADHD for somatic medical outcomes.",
            "There have been many studies  of diet and most have found it not to be relevant for ADHD.  One exception is that treatment studies using omega-3 fatty acids show that they reduce symptoms of ADHD but only weakly.  They are about 20% as effective as a stimulant medication.  That said, a healthy diet is good for all of us for many reasons.",

            "People with ADHD are have an increased risk for sleep problems, which cause fatigue.   A good example is sleep apnea.   Also, the mental effort associated wtih managing one's symptoms and staying organzied can be fatiguing, especially when one is not adequately treated.   Fatigue can also be a medication side effect due to the impact on sleep or a 'crash' that some experience when medications wear off.",

Those with ADHD are doing worse than those without ADHD in many areas of life even though they function better than the average IQ person.",
            "One reason for that type of problem is that those with ADHD are less affected by distant consequences than other people.  If a project is due in one month and I feel the consequence of not completing in now, I'm motivated to do it.  If i cannot feel that consequence (because the reward system in my brain is dysregulated by my ADHD), i don't do anything until I get closer to the due date and the consequence becomes more real to me.",

            "I don't know about data on common experiences but as regards dealing with children, taking care of yourself is crucial. Parents with ADHD should manage their ADHD effectively, with a method that work for you.   Being well-structured and organized is difficult for a person with ADHD but essential for parenting.  Some adults with ADHD have found cognitive behavior therapy or coaching to be helpful with those skills.",

            "There are a few new medications in development.  The closest to FDA approval is centanafadine, a non-stimulant.  Many academic labs and companies are working on computer or smartphone based treatments but none are FDA approved for treating symptoms of ADHD.  Trigeminal nerve stimulation therapy was approved by the FDA but is not easy to find.  Other brain stimulation methods are being tested.",
            "This is still being debated among experts.  Currently, there is no separate diagnosis of SCT. That could change in the future.",

The short version is that his idea that the core of ADHD is deficient self-regulation of behavior, thought and emotion provides a very good framework.    Think about development by comparing the behavior of a two year old and an eight year old.  The younger can barely regulate themselves.  They need lots of parental guidance.  By age eight, the typically developing child can sit still at the table, follow household rules, do chores, etc..   In the teenage years, we expect more self regulation although parents still provide structure and guidance.  When the young adult leaves home, parental structure is mostly gone and they need to completely self regulate.  Because people with ADHD have a difficult time self regulating, it is as if they are stuck an an earlier age.  The only way we know to get the adult with ADHD out of that rut is via treatment with medication and/or cognitive behavior therapy.",

It was when I entered professional work that the negatives showed up as I was now the one in charge of creating goals and keeping me on task.\n\nI did have one moment after already being diagnosed that I had to switch doctors for insurance and he responded very negatively in my first meeting that I couldn\u2019t have ADHD since I had a Masters degree. He has just come from practicing in crisis mental health and only knew extremes in what wrecked lives look like and then other extremes in abuse of amphetamines look like. He was having his own existential crisis in that visit since I think he really believed that stimulant medication would only lead to eventual addiction and misuse. It was a lot. I sent a message to the HMO about it, and he quickly invited me back and prescribed me a three-month supply of a controlled medication.

Our family dynamic was destroyed because we were undiagnosed and it ruined our relationship, because one family member in particular could only believe that we were that way intentionally, to hurt her. It's rough knowing that none of that needed to happen, and that there was not some magical silver lining to make it better. It was just a waste, and since I have a small obsession with doing things 'the best way' it was really hard to get past. \n\nOn top of that, now I have to work through all of the anxiety and bad habits I learned in order to cope, and it's overwhelming. If we had been diagnosed when we were younger, we could have built up the needed skills from the beginning and it would have been half the battle.",

            "I\u2019m obviously not the professor. But, I had success in this arena while I was in school. Also, my tale is only a single anecdote and it\u2019s worth noting that I was not diagnosed until well over a decade past my school and grad school days. Summary of the how to be more successful in academia at the bottom, these next few are on focusing on the research itself. \n\nAs another question of mine intones, I am more of a hyperfocuser. I loved diving into research papers, still do, and I was quick to find relevant parts. That was the game I played that I think allowed me to succeed. \n\nReading every word? That is the worst way to go about it. If you look at published papers, you\u2019ll see how they did their research in the Methodology section. Duplicating this process is a great strategy for researching in general. Gather a whole lot of papers, and quickly weed out the least relevant ones. The keyword search narrows it down and the abstract gives a great indication if the paper might say what you are looking for. But, you\u2019ll really need details. \n\nHow do you do that? My \u201cgame\u201d was to find and note a few important points. Most of these can be found in the first or last sentence of a paragraph. The first will generally be the \u201cI am going to say this important thing\u201d and then a ton of words about that. The last will generally be \u201cthe important thing,\u201d this is especially true of the last paragraph of a section. \n\nFor my initial scan, I\u2019ll pay little (but not zero) attention in the Methods and Results section and much more focus on the Discussion and Conclusion sections. \n\n\nWhile that may not help you, or anyone, changing my approach to the research really helped me advance in my schooling. By being able to be more informed, it helped me become more engaged. By being more engaged, the professors would recognize me and talk shop during their otherwise nearly-empty Office Hours. This often let me learn about where and who else to engage with for additional opportunities. This opened the door for multiple internships, research opportunities, and an objective way to differentiate myself from other applicants because I had done things and achieved success.",

In college since I was more independent and had less of a structure that is when I really look back on the typical signs. Of course there were some in childhood imo."

After a year of that, to every 6 months, and after 2 of those, to only one appointment every year. But I had to see them in person.

            "For many doctors that prescribe controlled substances, standard operating procedure is to only fill one month at a time. I am aware this can vary based on state regulations but in general it\u2019s what to expect. \n\nMy med provider sees me every month because first and foremost she is required to to send the prescription for another month, and secondly because she wants to make sure my dose on the three meds she prescribes are still working properly with no concerns.",
            "I am a psychiatrist myself.  The standard in almost all places is every three months.  Some places do monthly by their own policy.\nAll you have to do is go to another doctor and ask the clinic before hand what the policy is there.  And simply tell the doctor that your previous provider didn\u2019t accept your insurance, whether it is true or not.\nWhile a lot of people dislike the 3 month thing, if the rules were changed to 12 months for example several problems might occur.  One is that a doctor would have much more room to see people so rather than say 3000 patients, a doctor might have 12000.  And given that most doctors will give stimulants to people whether they have adhd or not, and given the demand for them given that they often help even if you do not have adhd, the amount of people taking them would massively increase and it would become extremely difficult to obtain them, more so than it already is. The only true deterrent to stopping people who don\u2019t truly need it is the difficulty in getting them.  \nPlus, if a doctor had 12000 patients, and all of them are messaging them every time an issue comes up, it would soak up so much free time the job would make you off yourself in no time, since answering messages is unpaid. \nGiven how financially incentivized it is to provide prescriptions, the truth is most people receiving medications don\u2019t truly have adhd, but think because the medicine has helped them or that because the doctor gave it them that they do, which is not necessarily the case. \nBut, I would be curious to see what would happen if you could simply buy them over the counter and didn\u2019t have to see a doctor at all",

I'm lucky to have pretty good insurance because it's self funded by the hospital I work for, but I'm also limited to seeing providers in their system because of my insurance. It's a big system though and hasn't been an issue yet.",

The insurance is probably billed a couple hundred. \n\nThere's a lot of money in America and when you have to get insurance for things or able to easily access credit like student loans, then companies can charge whatever the fuck they want.\n\nIt's actually sort of ok for a lot of workers who have insurance because sometimes the copays and deductibles are reasonable at least in my state, people only have to spend over X and the insurance company has to pay the rest. It absolutely crushes people who don't have insurance. A lot of times you can get a significant discount for paying cash without insurance but it's still a major pain in the ass and still expensive AF. \n\nCapitalism here doesn't work here because it's not really a free market.

It is fantastic, I have never had to wait or not be able to get my meds, and it is only about $17 a month for my prescription. \n\nGranted, it is expensive, and I am super lucky that I own my own business which is paying 100% of my health care.",
            "Which claims specifically",
            "That's just what they call the appointment, like short hand. My daughter sees her pediatrician every 3 months, and I tell the receptionist that so she knows how long of a time slot I'll need for the appointment.\n\nLike, a 5 minute appointment versus a 30 minute appointment for a full physical.",
            "It's just a brief 10-15 minute appointment (we usually do it over a videocall) where they ask how your meds are doing, whether they're still effective, if you're having any difficulties or have anything you want to address, etc.  \n\nMy doctor and I usually end up just chatting for most of it.",
            "Man I thought it was required to see your pcp every 3 months for a refill. Did your doc offer the once a year or did you have to ask for it?",
            "Good to know it's different in different places in the US - I assume it varies by state then?",
            "In the US, our doctors take on a ton of debt, get paid a lot, and still only see patients for 5-15 minutes. My provider is so busy he doesn't even review my chart beforehand. Some states here also allow advanced nurses to prescribe (APRNs). Not saying there aren't downsides in Canada, but these specifically happen here too, unfortunately. The wait time at therapy clinics and private practices in my area is around 6 months.",
            "Lucky you have a doctor like that. I haven\u2019t found any good luck in this state yet. I went through 2 psychiatrists already with negative experiences. If you have any tips on finding a new doc lmk!",
            "Just so you know I\u2019m in Illinois and on ADHD meds and I meet once every 3 months- so it\u2019s not a state law but could be your office\u2019s policy.",
            "Holy hell that\u2019s what I want. That would be sooooo much easier. It\u2019s almost like they take the disability into consideration which doesn\u2019t happen anywhere else. In my experience I was always wrong and the doctor was always right by protecting the meds while I spiraled to hell and back over and over. And over again. Turns out they thought only people that fit the 90\u2019s adhd stereotype could be treated for it. My new doctor at least let\u2019s it go 2 months instead of monthly.",
            "lol, that\u2019s how it is with my doc. she asks about the meds and if they\u2019re working for me. asks about my anxiety levels. we end up chatting the rest of the visit. 15-20 video call; script is sent to the pharmacy and delivered to my home within a day or two.",
            "Telemedicine, video call\nCosts very little",
            "It can be state dependent and if your doc is an NP or MD - mine is an NP and has to have an appointment with me every 3 months but only has to see me once or twice a year in person (was previously twice, but now after two years he told me once a year). Means the rest can be telehealth, and saves me from having to drive back to my hometown every quarter.",
            "wait - i thought it was every month!!! i have to ask again LOL i\u2019m almost out too",
            "It most likely does! I was prescribed adderall from 8th grade throughout college and took a 7 year break before restarting medication again. So much has changed between now and then and I am lucky I had a full psych eval done while I was in middle school because it saved me quite a headache now. Before, I was able to have my RX managed by my pcp. Now, i had to find a psychiatrist for medication management and undergo an initial general eval. I think protocol varies doctor to doctor and especially between states!",
            "By state and doctor lol my friend has to go see his doctor in person every 2 months, I see my doctor in person every 6 months with a zoom meeting in between.",
            "I\u2019ve been lucky with One Medical. They require a check in every 3 months just to see how your blood pressure is doing in relation to the stimulant meds. \nWhen I was laid off I let my physician know I needed to check the cost of uninsured visits and she said I could message her a photo of my blood pressure for my next 3 month script to not incur unnecessary office visit costs. \nAlso you can get an appointment within 2 days for pretty much anything. I know the upfront cost is a little \u201cblegh\u201d but it\u2019s really been worth it for me to be able to visit quickly, have scripts refilled easily and have a team that is actually LISTENING.\n\nEdit: I go to the Fremont location.",
            "Honestly, I think it\u2019s mostly my insurance, Kaiser Permanente. They are also my providers. It\u2019s a single payer system and it just freaking works.",
            "I've had the same experience: every 3 months in Illinois. I also think that some of those visits could be via telehealth, but I prefer to come into the office because I like the psych.",
            "My state just went to 6 months instead of 3. I told my PCP I kinda liked coming in 4x a year to discuss whatever other health issues were going on. \u201cYou know you can make an appointment any time you\u2019re sick, right?\u201d Ok, sure\u2026 but ADHD kinda gets in the way of that."

I've had my hyperfixations made fun of (can't control what I hyperfixate on).\n\nI can't control the volume of my voice when I get excited. In one of my 7th grade classes, a teacher spent a good 10 minutes telling me and my friends how we're super loud and disrupt the class (during work time). Normally, I would be okay with that. I would work on it. This teacher talked about how loud we are, and MOCKED us, to the ENTIRE CLASS.\n\nI feel guilty anytime someone gets mad at me. I once was singing to myself in a 6th grade class. My 'friend' looked at me and said: \"Shut up, (name). just shut up.\" I shut up. When I get upset at something, I stop talking. It gets REALLY uncomfortable when someone forces me to talk.\n\nNow I'd like anyone who romanticizes ADHD to tell me what makes all of this shit sound so desirable.

Looking back I think I was masking it really well. I hated going to the supermarket with my parents (still do as an adult) because it was so exhausting. \n\nThe past two years though, I have been highly depressed and anxious and would beat myself up whenever I didn't have a productive day. I would binge eat or not eat at all, skipping meals for a whole day. I would be in a great mood for a few days and then crash completely and rot in bed for an entire weekend. I would look myself in the mirror and love what I see and the day after completely hate my body and face and then the low self esteem and self hatred would begin. My brain would go on Overdrive to the point of having symptoms of migraine and fever because my thoughts never stop.\n\nI don't wish this on anyone it is not fun at all. It has its highs but mostly lows. Before my diagnosis I would never say \"I'm ADHD\" because I had a hard time to focus or whenever I had burst of energies and be hyper productive. Now that I am properly diagnosed and starting treatment next week and cognitive therapy, I feel relieved and I can finally cut myself some slack. \n\nAlso I see a lot of people saying it gets worse with age, I'm almost 26 and I am wondering when you got diagnosed and started treatment ?

I gave everything I had to this minimum wage job for 6 months and something changed in my brain. Suddenly I was not worthless, I was valued, I was good at something and people appreciated it. Suddenly I was not alone, but I had colleagues who wanted to hang out. My perceived self was no longer a useless, talentless failure, and my motivation returned. From there I took an apprenticeship and built a career in tech, got married and life is completely different.\n\nGive yourself more than 2 years OP, please.",

This is how we found out I have ADHD. \u00a0I have no idea what to do with my life, there are too many options and all of them seem wrong, I have RSD also that makes work life hell. Im just existing and watching how I am wasting my life. Also it does not help to see how other people seem to have easy to make decisions, work, stick to career plans. They take life and work much less intense This is where intense frustration, anxiety and depression kicks in. I recently started medication and hope this will help. It is suppoused to help also to this.",
            "Currently in a paralysis that was brought on when I couldn\u2019t find a job a month after moving to a new city. I\u2019m depressed but I have continued to add a couple things each day to my life. It\u2019s helping me slowly get out of my paralysis. \n\nAt the start I was sleeping a lot and just staying home. Now I work out about 4-6 days a week, with some variety in it. I listen to audiobooks on different topics, usually do a lot of YA, but have added some adhd books, some movies/shows based from books, some historical fiction and some self help. I do a little freelance work that helps push me to do something different, so I do website updates, paint doormats, make social media posts, and work on a little dog training. I make my only friend in the city make me go outside and body double for me so I apply for jobs. My family continue to check in on me and make me eat meals with them on a weekly basis, this helps me actually eat because alone I only do a meal a day. I started doing a running plan with Nike Run Club that helps me stay on my toes with what kind of run I\u2019m going to do (yes I can see beforehand what I am going to do but I don\u2019t on purpose). \n\nThis is something that I had to do for myself in the past when I dropped out of college. I was suicidal then and almost attempted. I am grateful I never actually did and learned how to get myself out of it but it was rough. I have my bachelors and masters now and although it took me a long time, it helped me understand myself more. I learned what is ok when I\u2019m depressed and what I need to get myself out of the fog enough to get myself on meds. \n\nAnti depressants have been the worst for me as only 1 has ever worked and sadly I can\u2019t be on it thanks to a side effect. Cymbalta apparently can help those with ADHD if you haven\u2019t tried it. Maybe try a change in meds? Not a change in dosage, I mean meds. \n\nI\u2019m sorry it hasn\u2019t been easy and hope things get better soon!",
            "Happened to me too.\n\nAll I can say is try different things.\n\nLike adding the numbers in any vehicles number plate(worked for me), try to listen to a new song any new song no matter how cringe, try listening poetry, reading and learning about other sides story (iykyk), watch cricket if you want its boring in a sense that it's slow so watch Pakistan's matches cause they are known to 'snatch defeat out of the mouth of victory' so that would be entertaining for you.\n\nand other things you can find to do and do new things until you find something which peaks your interest.",

            "The pills will need to be reduced somevso you can feel to do some of this. Feeling is important in order to process the emotional hold backs. If you can feel some, do this on that. \n\nWork on letting go of the unconscious idol of desiring to feel valid/validation, even from yourself. It is a soul sucker. To seek to feel valid or meaning, it keeps you in emotional lack. Putting validation requirements on yourself is a losing battle. Let it go. It's not worth it and it promises you peace. Peace will come when you let go of the desire to feel valid and meaning in life.\n\nI felt so worthless and useless and a failure at life. But all the pain was coming from me. I unfortunately valued feeling valid almost unto death. But it is not something we need. We can overcome this unconscious evil we place on ourselves.

We can let them go.\ud83d\ude4fWe can be at peace together in this world. Love can shine when the requirements of needing something that emotionally keeps us in lack.

Hold your head high and trust that your life is building to something great that you cannot see yet. \n\nI want to add that reading through some of these comments I see two themes coming up that strike a chord with me. First, we are more susceptible to burnout. We ride a wave of energy as hard as we can until we have nothing left to give. Burnout is a physiological condition that chemically alters your brain. Give yourself grace and time to recover with lowered expectations! Second, I keep hearing people talk about that \u2018spark\u2019 of interest. I know and love that spark and we ADHDers are lucky to experience it. Not everyone gets to experience the joy of being fully engrossed in something they are passionate about. I notice though that we rely on that spark to drive our actions. It\u2019s hard to develop the discipline that is needed to push through when the spark of motivation wanes. It\u2019s hard to achieve what you might envision as success without building your discipline muscles. I still suck pretty bad at discipline but I have figured it out enough to be happy for the most part.",
