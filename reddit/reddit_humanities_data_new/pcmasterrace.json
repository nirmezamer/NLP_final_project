            "**Enter here:** [**https://asus.click/pcmr-btf-campaign**](https://asus.click/pcmr-btf-campaign) (Winners' names will also be announced in this link after the drawing and in this thread).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, it seems like after a long period when the cool kids just wanted to make their cables prettier (because they most often weren't), now the big thing is not seeing the cables at all! Meet BTF, the ASUS hidden connector design that makes it so CPU, GPU + almost all motherboard cables are pretty much invisible, which, if that's your thing, can make for some extremely clean builds. The connectors and most cables can be placed on the underside of the motherboard, making way for a look that feels ultimately more simple than seeing a bunch of cables everywhere.\n\nBesides BTF there is ADVANCED BTF, that goes even further, and eliminates the need for GPUs to have an external (and often not great looking) power cable connected directly to the GPU, but instead powers them through a PCIe high-power connector on BTF graphics cards that is compatible with a high-power slot available on BTF motherboards.\n\nNow, we've teamed up with ROG to give to some very lucky members of the community a chance to get their hands on some of the most prized BTF components out there, including, the absolute dream that is the RTX 4090 Strix BTF!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE PRIZES**\n\n1 winner will receive this combo:\n\n* **ROG Maximus Z790 Hero BTF Motherboard**\n* **ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4090 BTF Edition Graphics Card**\n\n1 winner will receive this combo:\n\n* **TUF Gaming Z790-BTF WiFi Motherboard**\n* **TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER BTF White Edition Graphics Card**\n\n1 winner will receive this combo:\n\n* **ROG Maximus Z790 Hero BTF Motherboard**\n* **ROG Hyperion GR701 BTF Edition Chassis**\n\n1 winner will receive this combo:\n\n* **TUF Gaming Z790-BTF WiFi Motherboard**\n* **TUF Gaming GT302 ARGB Chassis**\n\n1 winner will receive this combo:\n\n* **ROG Maximus Z790 Hero BTF Motherboard**\n* **Corsair 6500X Chassis (Black)**\n\n1 winner will receive this combo:\n\n* **TUF Gaming Z790-BTF WiFi Motherboard**\n* **Cooler Master MasterBox 600 Chassis (White)**\n\n1 winner will receive this combo:\n\n* **TUF Gaming B760M-BTF WiFi Motherboard**\n* **InWin D5 Chassis (Black)\u200b**\n\n3 winner(s) will receive a **ROG Falchion RX Low Profile\u200b Keyboard**\n\n3 winner(s) will receive a **ROG Gladius III Wireless AimPoint\u200b Mouse**\n\n5 winner(s) will receive the **ROG Cetra True Wireless SpeedNova\u200b Headphones**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's 25 prizes for 18 lucky winners! And yes, this is a WORLDWIDE event!\n\n**Enter here:** [**https://asus.click/pcmr-btf-campaign**](https://asus.click/pcmr-btf-campaign)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can enter until June 30, 2024 at 11:59PM PDT and the winner will be picked, contacted and then announced on socials, including this very thread. More info and full terms are on the [main entry page](https://asus.click/pcmr-btf-campaign).\n\nMay your framerates be high, and your temperatures low this month of June, preferably with a nice ASUS BTF hardware bundle or other ROG goodies.

This hybrid technology leverages the self-emissive properties of OLED panels, which are known for their ability to display perfect black levels and wide viewing angles. By incorporating quantum dots, QD OLED displays achieve a notable increase in brightness and a wider color spectrum compared to traditional OLEDs. These quantum dots are stimulated by blue light to emit precise colors, significantly enriching the visual experience with more saturated and vivid hues. As a result, QD OLED displays not only maintain the incredible contrast and deep blacks characteristic of OLED technology but also offer enhanced brightness and color vibrancy, making them suitable for a wider variety of lighting conditions. This combination of features allows QD-OLED displays to deliver exceptionally rich and dynamic visuals, setting a new standard in the realm of premium displays.\n\n**AORUS Exclusive Features**\u00a0\n\n* OLED Care - OLED Care runs AI-based presets in the background to optimize the OLED panel for longer life and prevent image sticking with minimal user interference. This unique feature includes pixel clean, static control, pixel shift, APL stabilization, sub-logo dim, and corner dim. You will get to enjoy the AORUS OLED gaming monitor just as the first time you unbox it!\n* Tactical Switch - It\u2019s a physical key for changing display size and resolution to 24.5\u201d and FHD, which is the most popular display mode for competitive gamers. Turn the key and be always ready to join the fight!\u00a0\n* Tactical Features - This helps gamers to enhance their gaming skills while in-game, including black equalizer 2.0, PiP/PbP, night vision, customized crosshair, time & counter, and the dashboard.\u00a0\n\n**3-Year Extended Warranty on QD OLED Monitor**\n\nEarlier this March, we announced the extended 3-year warranty to provide you with peace of mind and protection against potential panel image retention issues, ensuring a flawless gaming and entertainment experience over a longer period. This extended warranty applies to all QD OLED monitors mentioned above, so you don\u2019t have to worry about anything after purchasing.\u00a0If you\u2019re curious, you can find [the original news release here](https://www.gigabyte.com/Press/News/2154#:~:text=In%20a%20commitment%20to%20delivering,FO27Q3%2C%20MO34WQC2%2C%20MO34WQC%20models.).\u00a0\n\n**What is firmware update? How to find the firmware update?**\u00a0\n\nThe monitor firmware updates can enhance and optimize the monitor functions and capabilities. You can always find the most recent firmware update on the corresponding product page on the GIGABYTE official website to help keep the monitor the most up-to-date. As of May 2024, there is a new firmware update available for [FO32U2 Pro](https://www.gigabyte.com/Monitor/AORUS-FO32U2P/support#support-dl-firmware), [FO32U2](https://www.gigabyte.com/Monitor/AORUS-FO32U2/support#support-dl-firmware), and [FO27Q3](https://www.gigabyte.com/Monitor/AORUS-FO27Q3/support#support-dl-firmware). This version (F03) fixes the issue with Pixel Clean not being able to auto-start at standby mode as noted on the website. Remember to update the firmware when you receive your new monitor and to check back regularly for any future updates as well.\u00a0\n\n---------------------------------\n\nAnything else that you\u2019d like to know?

            "QD OLED sounds super cool! It\u2019s like the best of both worlds when it comes to TV and monitor screens. With QD OLED, you get those deep, perfect blacks from OLED that make movies and games look insanely good, especially in dark scenes. But then it also uses quantum dots to make the colors pop even more and the screen brighter, which is awesome because sometimes OLEDs can be a bit dim in bright rooms.",

            "Cool!",
            "Any of these monitors are definitely better than my 30hz 1336x768 cheap Chinese TV that I use as a monitor due to not having money to buy a decent monitor,\n\nSo yea any those would make world of difference.",

Nothing like fighting with insurance for treatments you need to live, I'm blessed to be healthy but I know many who are not and pay so much for stuff that shouldn't cost anything. Not to mention we have some of the worst food control laws, every grocery store has like 1 isle's worth of healthy food, the rest of it processed sugar filled junk, even some things marketed as heart healthy are loaded with sugar. Still very blessed to live here, and best of luck with future endeavors, and i hope it gets better for u."

            "This has been something ive been wanting to do for awhile but it doesnt work when its hot outside so its really counter productive.",
            "Using the warm air to attract all the neighborhood cats huh? Clever.",
            "Would you get condensation doing this?",
            "I must have seen this photo here 2 years ago.",
            "I kinda want to move to Alaska or Iceland so I'll never have to pay for AC in the summer and heating in winter because of my intel ~~CPU~~room heater. Are life there easier than in Los Angeles? What about electricity bill?",
            "Why not put the pc in the other room and run cables to the monitors and everything you need.",
            "Shouldn't the AC be at the front, or at least the bottom?\n\nThe flow with warm air rising as well as the hottest components being at the back of the case should allow the heat to be taken out quickest.",
            "But why",
            "yawl cant fuckin get cardboard and tape to seal that gap? you know how many fuckin btu's you're losing?!?!?\n\nWHAT ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE THEY ARE GUNNA BLAME UR COMPUTER BILL",
            "Just why?\nThere's no point to it",
            "I\u2019m trying to do something similar. Just want one vent to exhaust out my window. Room gets up to 84 degrees when pc is on hahahaha",
            "The person who put this level of effort into this and then didn\u2019t put a board in the window is an idiot.",
            "At this point I guess it would be easier and better looking to place the PC outside and get the monitor and peripherals cables back in.",
            "Yeah this is a serious issue during summer gaming PCs heat up rooms so much it\u2019s insane",
            "I would worry about condensation",
            "Looks cool lmao \ud83e\udd23",
            "Genius \ud83d\ude0e",
            "Exhaust out the back, cold air in the front",
            "In case of fire Break The Glass",
            "how it feels to have 0 percent humidity.\n\nmy shit would RUST.",
            "All I did was zip tie more fans in front of and back of my cooler hung them from the top of the case and used tape to hold them in place",
            "Honestly at that point and cost..  just upgrade.",
            "If you live somewhere cold and its that time of the season, This would be the best thing.",
            "Bro got the real airflow, ain't no way a even volcano is getting hot in there",
            "That looks like a pain in the ass",
            "I wanna see a benchmark/temps with and without this thing. I bet it makes like a 2% difference",
            "AirCo seems to be a better option, isn't it?",
            "Probably not good during the summer.",
            "Do those exhaust fans have enough pressure to move the air through the vents??",
            "My PC is jealous of my airbrush rig",
            "Mmmm rust",
            "I did something similar but only to remove hot air. In the summer this is necessary, otherwise the room gets too hot when I run something demanding.",
            "All of this trouble to just buy an AC and it works far better",
            "I would do this, but just with the computer in another room.  The monitors and shit would be in a separate room",
            "Even the neighbour can have a piece of that cooling",
            "Same room would stay cool haha but imagine doing this then having bugs find their way in there haha.",
            "Never smoke by your rig! Always make sure to fill with pollen and debris from outside air instead!",
            "Nothing like hot outside air entering your pc.",
            "Or you know don't buy flagship CPU/GPU 3x the price and 5x thermal exhaust for 30% performance gain",
            "Is it not just AC in and 2 outs for hot?",
            "I do the same thing with a water cooled rig, radiator out the window.\n\nIt works fine in the 100F/35C summer. The rain didn\u2019t kill the fans, and I have done it 3 years now.",
            "Yeah cause I love piping humidity straight into my PC!",
            "I think the biggest problem would be humidity and condensation",
            "Counter argument: Move to Siberia or an equally cold region.",
            "Total pussy magnet",
            "If the AC air is colder than the dew point, it possible could. I doubt that is the case though.",
            "We had them window AC units in Florida and my roommate tried using one to cool his computer and yeah, he got a whole bunch of moisture in there",
            "Old but gold.",
            "Now im curious how big of a solar panel would be need to run a pc and monitors",
            "Warm air rising doesn't apply to enclosed spaces with actively agitated air, like a PC case with fans running. The ideas of warm fluid up, cold fluid down, fall apart pretty quick when currents are involved.\n\nAC air in with exhaust out the window would be awesome. Definitely on the list when I'm finally in my own home.",
            "To get the heat outside and not in my hot room \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
            "As most things hobby, because why not",
            "Could be someone who lives in the southern hemisphere. I hear its winter in Australia.",
            "Yeah I was thinking the same thing. Seems like the obvious choice would be to have the front intake duct hooked to AC, but it doesn't appear to be. Just sucking in whatever temperature is out there.",
            "Yeah but then you have really hot air from outside at greater volume that needs to be made up somewhere and conditioned. So it's really counter productive as the AC just works harder. Alright if the AC has spare capacity not ok if it's at it's limits.",
            "lol did you imagine the air conditioner?",
            "After watching LTTs video on GPU manufacturing, it seems like they stress test PC components in 45+C (113F) high humidity environment for hours to ensure it works properly. \n\nSo I\u2019m assuming OPs setup could be safe enough to do this anywhere in the world with hot weather. The only issue is that you\u2019re obviously going to be missing out on maybe 20C of thermal headroom (at 25C room temp). Perhaps 25-27C if you\u2019re in an air conditioned room normally. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sure if the CMOS battery of a motherboard would last very long at those high temperatures. \n\nIf you can normally get 50-60C running on full load in a normal room temp room, then I would guess the performance hit would not be much, but all your components would be running at their maximum temps (80-90C). I don\u2019t think that\u2019s so bad, it\u2019s constant thermal cycling that would kill them. Depends on use case. Probably not worth all the effort.",
            "i almost posted this, but you already did xD",
            "IF AC air is incoming than it is dry, condensation can happen only on the outer surfaces of the case.\n\nSimple practical test: turn AC on in your car if the windows are fogged up.",
            "As an hvac tech, there's more than one reason your supply ducts are insulated. 1) is obviously to keep the air insulated so its as cold as possible when it reaches the load space. 2) supply ducts condensate when not insulated.\n\nIts a distinct possibility that if you live in a humid environment (like say the us east coast) you could have some condensation in your computer. We're talking about introducing 50-55 degree air to your system at a not insignificant cfm rate. Itll cool the hell out of it to be sure. Just not certain it would be worth the risk. \n\nSecondary consideration. Yes, your return air is filtered. Even if you change the filter regularly, your unit gets filthy on the inside. Air from your ac vent isnt the cleanest, so youre gonna end up sending excess dust, mold particles, and humidity directly into your computer.",
            "https://preview.redd.it/braxqnfu608d1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00838270291e5c79c19b757f4f82c4b5f99aeb47\n\nSame job, less chaos, more efficient, probably cheaper too. Well, moves the chaos out of the room.",
            "Fair",
            "What do you think the r-value is on your ducting?",
            "I sincerely doubt that the output of a single gaming PC is neglible to your room temp. Replace your windows, better insulation, sealing windows/cracks, replace HVAC with a modern system, etc would do wonders.",
            "That's what I tell my victims",
            "If it\u2019s cold just open the window, inside will be cold as well now no need for the ducting. If it\u2019s not cold it\u2019s hot and it\u2019s pointless/ worse. If it\u2019s a medium temp then it\u2019s pointless as well. It only really works if it\u2019s hooked up to an ac unit which it\u2019s not and if it\u2019s winter like snowy cold winter then it\u2019s too damn cold to leave the whole window open.",
            "We can't really tell direction from the photo no?",
            "What\u2019s this - mind explaining",
            "I don't know if OP thought about this but if you want to have an exhaust for hot air there ought to be an intake vent somewhere to avoid creating negative pressure inside the room that would reduce the effectiveness of the fans.  This is also assuming that OP wants to keep their room cool, not just the PC.\n\n\nI don't think it'd be needed if there was central ac though",
            "Fair point. I suppose sucking it in from the top-rear could work. I can't tell which ways the fans are oriented. edit: looks like top-rear is in, front 2 on rad are exh, and video card just gets its own special duct?",
            "if its a blower fan style gpu, front and bottom air tubes/ducts (?) are exhaust. top white tube is intake.\n\nalso assuming this house has in-floor heating or he removes this mod in winter time.",
            "Big silver one is in, has water-cooling radiator with either 2x120 or 2x140 fans the two whites are exhaust as you know, heat rises\n\nAlso cables don't go in the front down low, where the slots are",
            "How can you not tell? \n\nCool air goes in the front, hot air comes out the back unless you\u2019ve really screwed something up.",
            "It's long distance water cooling, the main rad/pump is probably in another room.",
            "A heat exchanger. Cold(relative to the loop), water from a tank located elsewhere. Cools off the loop. \n\nDirectly extracts the 400w ish the GPU dumps, and allows the CPU to get nice cold water. That then goes through the rads, cooling off again for the GPU.",
            "It\u2019s a small chiller. It uses a different source to cool (water?) the \u2018block heat exchanger\u2019 while having the water from the PC go through secondary coil in for that loop. Basically conditioned cool water(?) absorbing the warm water from the PC.",
            "middle duct is outdoors..idk which way it's going though",
            "So you\u2019re just assuming that the front fans are set up as intake rather than exhaust? Nobody can tell from the photos what orientation the fans are set up in. It does not make sense to have an Exhaust fan attached to ducting because you would have cold air blowing on cold air and the flow of direction from both ends would produce no result other than unneeded condensation.",
            "It's convention to make the front fans the intake and the rear fans the exhaust.  The drive stack needs cooling, and it's easier to get air into those tight and narrow spaces with an intake fan right next to it than with an exhaust fan in the same place.  This is why CPU fans are set up to blow air into the heat sink rather than out of the heat sink.\n\nEither way, the guy who made this is an idiot.",
            "When was the last time you saw a dust filter on the back of the case? Anyone with experience can tell with 90% certainty what this is.\n\nI\u2019ve built several hundred machines in my lifetime and I\u2019ve never seen the exhaust on the front. Maybe a rack server, but this isn\u2019t one of those. The dust filters go with the intake, and where do you find them?\n\nIt makes perfect sense to have ducting on an exhaust fan because where else does the heat go? You would create a problem with heat and pressure if you duct in without ducting out. It\u2019s called the conservation of energy in physics.\n\nDucting is to fix the ambient temperature of the room. If the ambient temperature isn\u2019t a problem, then why duct at all?\n\nTrust me, I watched 2 air conditioners freeze over learning this lesson.",
            "So what are you implying? That the ac is on the ceiling and only 1 fan is sucking air from there, while the other 2 tubes are exhausts?",
            "Yes I understand that\u2019s how cases are designed but you can still setup a pc however you want. Have you seen benchmarks of their setup? How can you be sure the results are not satisfactory?",
            "I would imagine the two white lines are for intake air and the front is set up as a pull through exhaust. There is a 120v blower installed under that case, there is no need for wimpy little case fans with a fan like that.",
            "Exactly, it\u2019s what makes logical sense. He wanted to have the pc facing a certain way and this fan location provided shortest location to the duct.\n\nNegative pressure setups can have decent performance as well \ud83d\ude0b",
            "I don't need to look at benchmarks to know that this setup is stupid and needlessly ineffecient.  Bernoulli would be rolling in his grave.",
            "My only thought is that the blower fan with its direction of flow would cause hot air to get taken in by that second instale directly above. \n\nCould be that the rear bottom fan is exhaust and the setup is negative pressure.\n\nWaiting for op to verify \ud83d\ude00",
            "Negative pressure doesn\u2019t mean the air comes out the front. \n\nWell, it shouldn\u2019t, unless you\u2019re making a vacuum cleaner and tiny fire hazard.",
            "Close minded much?",
            "https://preview.redd.it/ndh8ycqgj38d1.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a5ca4a188a6d2c52a1ec1b9500dd47627dba97c",
            "When did you build and test a ducting system? I can see that you would really love to, but you\u2019re making things up, and hoping for them to be true.\n\nMaybe try some small scale experiments and see how this goes. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ll be surprised and learn a lot.",
            "In simple terms Negative pressure just means you have more exhaust"
