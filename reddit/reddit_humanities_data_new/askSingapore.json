Here are a few of my hobbies:\n\n\u2022 Personally I\u2019ve been going to the gym consistently for about 1 year now although there\u2019s still quite a long way to go. I\u2019ve been plateau-ing a lot with my lifts recently so if you have any advice hmu\n\n\u2022 Love to play badminton but I guess I would only consider myself HB level and I\u2019m more of a casual player. I\u2019m down to join in some bookings in the west/central for games during weekends\n\n\u2022 I like boarding sports. Used to cruise to my uni with a penny board and also a bit of snowboarding. Don\u2019t really think I\u2019ll be able to continue this but it sure is something I\u2019ve enjoyed a lot.\n\n\u2022 Would take commute or travel for good food\n\n\u2022 Other than that I do play some games, mostly Dota every now and then. Although I must say dota games are very tiring to me nowadays. I can only play 1/2 games max during the weekends and I too tired to continue. ( mi too weeek nao :( ) would love to occasionally play l4d2 for shits and gigs. Used to play a bit of maple on private servers (partly because of Covid) but already quit since it\u2019s a waste of time\n\n\u2022 I watch anime quite a lot but rarely discuss about it. I appreciate the animation done and also wholesome animes like the recent Frieren and apothecary diaries.\n\n\u2022 Also watch quite a lot of Netflix. ( especially in MRTs ) Recently really got into F1 after watching their BTS content from F1: Drive to Survive\n\nHmu if there\u2019s any weekend west/central badminton or you\u2019re interested to hangout and slowly become friends :)",

Wedding planning made me realize how very little friends I have so I'd like to make more! I'm gonna be 30 in November and as someone who didn't have it good growing up, I'm always looking for self-improvement - so if you'd like to talk about inner child healing, life goals, personal growth etc. (don't worry I won't trauma dump LOL) I'm down to be your listening ear.\n\nAs for music, I'd say I listen to a bit of everything. I consider myself a big Swiftie but NOT going to the Eras tour coz I couldn't get tickets and I'm not feeding the scalpers. I used to frequent a few concerts back in the day and life was so much easier then. Anyway...\n\nI used to play games like Valorant, Fortnite etc. but not much anymore. Considering selling my gaming PC hahaha. Currently waiting for GTA6 next year.\n\nI also like watching True Crime, Anime, used to be into trashy TV lmao but these days I just watch whatever on Netflix to justify the subscription. \n\nLooking forward to making some friends :D",

Looking for friends to chat with or go out to do whatever you like if you're comfortable meeting me irl.\n\nSuper introvert but I'll talk once I'm comfortable plus I'm a good listener. This post is probably the most I've pushed myself out of my comfort zone. I'm basically a ghost coz I have no social media and I don't have any close friends. So atp I'm rather desperate to have someone that I can just talk to on a daily basis. My job gives me quite a lot of free time plus my lack of commitment to anything actually... means I'm pretty much free most of the time. Prefer small groups or 1-1.\n\nAs for interests... I think I just really need any sort of human interaction even if it's just chilling somewhere to have drinks and a chat. I'm just hoping you guys can show me your hobbies or maybe we can try new things together if you need someone to accompany you (coz I do too haha). I'm quite active so I'm ok with physically exhausting activities. Dm me (please?)",

Idk why but lost interest in BG3 after Act 1 which was great.\n\nFood: Eat a lot of hawker food all over Singapore (mainly East + Central area). Also go to Malaysia fairly often to makan (esp JB and surrounding area). Would like to exchange recommendations! Do not really like cafes in SG as many are overpriced.\n\nTravel: I only travel solo but enjoy planning my own itineraries. Travelled free & easy multiple times in Europe and would like to start exploring Japan & China attractions in the near future.

Currently thumbing through LKY's memoirs (1965 onwards)\n* in the day I work in the STEM field and I also am inclined towards science and math.

Some how my mum stop buying Maggi and the next time I try it was during covid. Like you I was excited but the taste is so disappointing. Noodles tasted different, msg tasted different, nothing close to what I remember \ud83d\ude2d",
            "I can't imagine why anyone ever liked it or Maggie mie. I put it down to lack of knowledge of other products out there.\n\nI remember back before 2010 or so, Indomie was fairly unknown here and all the Singaporean kids swore by Maggie mie lmao.",
            "they change their formulation according to mass market taste.\n\nyes, they reduce Msg and salt due to health concerns feedback.\n\ni think only their bowls  havent changed in flavor in the between 2005 and 2023. but they have reduced a lot of the freeze dried garnishes (freeze dried chicken, crab(fish) stick) \n\n mostly, i buy plain instant noodles and create my own soup nowadays except curry.  its combining my meal prep leftovers  with the noodles. \n\notherwise its the cheapest packs of noodles add my own veggies and meats.",
            "They bake their noodles iirc and they go the healthier route - maybe that\u2019s why? I do feel less guilty after eating but yea taste wise it doesn\u2019t hold up as well \ud83d\ude06",
            "Anything other than Indomie is only for the uninitiated. Have some self respect and have nothing other than Indomie FTW",
            "Just stick with Maggie chicken and Maggie curry won't ever go wrong.",
            "Noodles are cheap to produce. Costs probably less than $0.10 to produce one pack that we pay a couple dollars for. And Tat Hui foods makes a lot of stuff.  This is one of their many products.",
            "Im still curious about the type of demographics that buy their range of \"healthier\" noodles which are air-dried etc.",
            "Most surprisingly is I find Koka at africa, tried it once and it is worse than local african food...facepalm",
            "Me. I'm a ytf koka noodle person. Haha. When I make packet noodles at home the family brand we use is CQYD but if the ytf stall says koka noodles I just get koka noodles lor\n\n\nIts ok what. Hahaha I can't tell the diff lol.",
            "This really hit me when I bought a pack of honey stars recently. It was my favorite as a kid, but my mum didn't buy it for us often because not healthy. Took one bite and almost cried (I'm pregnant and get sad easily), it was so tasteless.",
            "ur tastebuds basically change out every 7 years from what i heard so your tastes may change with it, on the bright side maybe something u didnt like will taste good to u now",
            "Their curry flavour noodles taste kinda watered down",
            "I love the purple range lol. Only the chili lime flavour.\n\nAgree that the texture is nothing close to Korean instant noodles but chili lime to me is quite dope.",

            "Wahh yeh Maggi really cannot these days. Pretty big different from the past when it was almost like staple food. Also tried buy back for the nostalgia. Tried one pack and gave up on the rest. haha",
            "less sugar, zero honey.",
            "ive only eaten the chicken flavour but yeah i agree. need to put v less water for it to taste nice, which sucks bc i love the soup",
            "I agree! I can't find back the taste I had when eating it as a kid!",
            "I don\u2019t follow the instructions. I only add 100ml\nOf water to the soup mix in the bowl.\n\nI cook the noodles in a pot until just done and then scoop them into the soup. Is the only way I can get the noodles to taste like they used to as a kid. Maybe they reduced msg / salt?\n\nBut now I\u2019m older also I sometimes just add stuff and omg I love Maggie curry noodles with kimchi now. Sooo good."
