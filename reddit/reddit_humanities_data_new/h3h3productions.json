            "I still haven\u2019t figured out why Ethan decided to conduct the interview like that\u2026 that\u2019s not how you interview someone, especially when you have no proof they are in the wrong. A cat doesn\u2019t get that sick over night, she had plenty of time to take her to the vet. As a cat owner, I\u2019m always on high alert for any symptoms I notice. Cats are good at hiding their pain, so if it got to the point of what we saw in the video, she must have been suffering for a while. I\u2019m disappointed by how Ethan handled this issue.",
            "Appreciate Olivia and Dan, especially this episode.",
            "Dan proving once again why he's the most level headed",
            "PLEASE if you see a dying animal you should 100 percent try and rescue it. The fact that she had this cat for months sick and he tried to rescue this cat speaks volumes to each of there characters if you ask me.",
            "Am I the only one who is suspicious that she never took the cat to the vet EVER, like never a check up for vaccines or a microchip or nothing? Like or did she take him to the vet before but not recent enough.",
            "\nI\u2019m having a really hard time with the conclusions the crew are getting to\u2026.\n\nI think when they did the interview the guy was obviously flustered and forgetting specific details, but he was still implying a lot of things. Like to me it was obvious that he was at that house and was passively observing the cat for a decent amount of time and noticing the way it was being treated, to me it sounded like there was a conversation between the roommates about the condition of the cat and it seemed like they had all agreed upon taking action if this girl wasn\u2019t. \n\nOn top of that Olivia is right, during Covid it would\u2019ve been incredibly hard to get a pet in. And to top that, yes, urgent cares do not have the same amount of care an actual vet would. And why would you bring a sick animal to wait hours in emergency, just to get subpar care? Wouldn\u2019t you rather the animal feel safe and wait a day or two when you KNOW the animal will actually get treated and correctly observed? \n\nNot to mention the guy literally said he thought the cat was starving at first, and didn\u2019t realize that the cat maybe had more going on which is why it took an extra day or two to get to the vet. Also coming down on this guy for waiting 3 1/2 days compared to the MONTHS this girl had the cat.. like really? \n\nWith the seizures too.. cats don\u2019t randomly have seizures, usually that happens because of an underlying condition that requires medication. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that was happening in her care before he took the cat.\n\nWhen I originally heard about this situation I had watched her first tiktok about it. My initial reaction was that something was off because if I was in her situation and my cat got out and it was sick, I would be destroyed. Even years later I find it hard to talk about my dog that passed because I was away at college when it happened and I feel incredibly guilty that I wasn\u2019t there for her. Imagine thinking that your cat is sick, lost, and alone and just talking about how \u201cyou didn\u2019t kill your cat\u201d. Like please, and the fake in and out of crying on her videos\u2026 really girl? \n\nIn conclusion I would\u2019ve done the same thing that the guy did. I\u2019ve been in a similar situation before with a roommate and I did speak with him, eventually he decided to give the cat to someone who would care for it. But we don\u2019t know this girl, that conversation could\u2019ve been had between other roommates. Ultimately if the cat was this sick to the point where he brings it to the vet and their best advice is to put it down.. it was very obviously neglected, and it bothers me how this guy is on the hot seat and not the girl. \n\nI get they need to question every motive of this guy but they did it so harshly and focused on small things and it felt like they missed the point of what he was saying.\n\nI love the H3 podcast and I\u2019ll always be a dedicated viewer but I feel like they missed the mark with this one (as doobrik would say)",
            "BUT YOU WERE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY, GIRL. she\u2019s saying that Seven got sick often, and she never took her to get checked out. you were given the opportunity to address her health concerns multiple times and YOU DIDN\u2019T. \n\nthe guy who took her cat is definitely a bit strange too, but i don\u2019t think he\u2019s responsible for Seven\u2019s death at all.",
            "I knew this was going to go downhill when the girl dropped a superchat.",
            "This is sad, as someone who works in the vet field regardless of what happened the cat should not have gone 3 weeks without seeing a vet\u2026 also the shelter should\u2019ve been contacted only to discuss medical history and advice, she should have absolutely seen a vet a few days after symptoms pursued. Yeah it\u2019s her first pet but don\u2019t get a cat then if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing \ud83e\udd72 she has more than enough $$ I\u2019m sure to have gotten her adequate care.",
            "This is probably the only time in h3 Reddit history that I believe that the insane amount of criticism the gang is getting is warranted.",
            "I don\u2019t think he deserves the hate, why would he take the cat and spend money on the visit? Why would he even take the cat even in the first place? He was only outed because someone leaked his DMs, so I don\u2019t think he did it for attention.",
            "That girl should be banned from ever owning an animal again she tortured that cat",
            "For a vet to recommend putting down a cat, that cat is very far gone \nHe would not have been able to neglect the cat enough in 4 days for the vet to recommend euthanasia. Saying that the cat died under his care is ridiculous. That cat was neglected for long enough that the vet literally did not believe it was going to make it. A cat won\u2019t get that bad in 4 days. That\u2019s an extended period of neglect. Ethan and hila were unnecessarily hard on him. And AB trying to say he stole the cat for content is so fucking wrong. I think they owe Jacob an apology",
            "Why are we making so many assumptions \ud83d\ude2d ESH!!",
            "Hila was so rude during the interview coupled with Ethan yelling to interrupt and ask if he was in love with Rhegan??? So inappropriate I never come on the reddit but I had to see if people agreed",
            "I just want to add, on NYE one of my cats got super sick so I couldn\u2019t take him to a vet unless it was an emergency vet and I wasn\u2019t sure of what to do. I don\u2019t even have a Chewy subscription nor have I ever purchased anything from them but I was able to use their online chat with a vet that I could let them know what was going on and get some advice. The advice I got was to monitor and see if the cat got sick again and if it did take it to the emergency vet/ take him in the next business day that my normal vet was open. Js, even without bringing the cat in, there are ways to get better advice \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
            "She's a terrible owner. When my cat, or dogs are sick, I take them to the vet and I would never get a new cat and not take them to the vet. And if my cat went missing, I would not go out partying. Jacob was wrong to take the cat but he did not kill her. Three days is not crazy for the vet during that time. At least he bloody tried, the reckless speculation by the crew was kinda off-putting. It's just really sad.",
            "**A cat doesn't get in that bad of shape in less than a week.**\u00a0I think she had FLV or FIP and I don't think R did due diligence at all to notice the signs.\n\nI agree with Dan that the other guy, J, was stupid and young and didn't do right by the cat either/maybe had petty intentions, but by the time he was involved, it was way too late anyway.",
            "Is this girl an idiot?",
            "I don't know if Ethan and Hila have never come across as more out of touch lol",
            "i don't think this guy was in the right but his point that the cat had been sick before and she hadn't ever taken it to the vet is damning. if you love your cat so much why are you just letting it get sick continually and doing nothing about it? what a shit show",
            "It\u2019s so weird to me how they immediately started dogpiling this guy; I mean seriously, stressing him out about \u201cYou could\u2019ve taken the cat to the vet\u201d \nhe told you guys the reasons why he couldn\u2019t \nand then to have the gall to tell him \u201cYou could\u2019ve waited in line but- you didn\u2019t want to wait - you just didn\u2019t want to wait!!\u201d \nwhen you guys were literally just talking about how easily cats can get stressed out \u2026 but yeah, seems like a great idea to wait in line for hours with a sick kitty isolated in its crate!!! God i hate how passive aggressive they can get when they think they\u2019re right about something. It\u2019s so fucking annoying.\nAll in all everyone is just odd and annoying in this whole situation.",
            "ISTG the OJ trial took less time to decipher. Why are we picking every bit of this story apart? lolol",
            "owning cat at content house should be banned",
            "The vibes are so awful rn. This is such a sad and intense story.",
            "cats can't lose 3 POUNDS in 4 days.",
            "Why did AB just make up an entire scenario in his head about Jacob taking the cat just to play the hero, and then play it off as real?, it was pure conspiracy. That was insane, and against someone trying to save a poor neglected animal...",
            "Yikes, this whole interview seems unnecessarily aggressive and pointless.\n\nWhere are the goofs and gaffs? \ud83d\ude2d",
            "Hila is taking it too personal, yes if someone stole my perfectly healthy and spoiled dog I would go after them. She was neglecting the animal!!!!! The cat died!! Did he see enough to justify taking the cat, probably not but she killed her cat period.",
            "They could have milked it harder and got the girl to call in if they didnt go so hard on him in the interview. She noped out after seeing that. Also I find it weird how Ethan just automatically takes the side of the girl in most cases like with Daisy. \n\nWish they let Oliv and Dan speak more on this as they seemed to have a more level opinion on the matter.",
            "This is a really sad and depressing episode.",
            "This episode makes me wonder how you guys view cats in general? Why is their abuse less severe to watch than the supposed dog video? Would you have shown videos of a dying dog too? If it was a dying, severely malnourished dog with secretions coming out of the airways, diarrhea, matted fur and seizures that got saved from a room in a loud LA party house\u2026 would you have grilled a person who stepped in and took it to the vet in that case?",
            "I liked exactly nothing about todays episode. Weird ass takes from Ethan, Hila, AB, and even Love. Grilling the guy and then claiming he did this because of some jealousy thing or other ulterior motives. Seemingly siding with the neglectful owner. Showing a video of a seizing cat?? Seems like everyone collectively lost the fucking plot this episode. It also sucks that this ep is so close to the break because now they\u2019re gonna have to rehash this whole thing on Monday because of the backlash, or because the girl decided to call in, or some other idiotic reason. I don\u2019t see goofs or gaffs on the horizon and it makes me sad. RIP Sevyn, the ONLY victim in this situation.",
            "I\u2019ve been a silent watcher for years but this was insane to watch. The grilling everyone did on Josh was so unfair. Do I agree with how he handled it, no\u2026 but honestly it seems like there were sincere intentions. I also feel more research should have been done on Rhegan and all her deleted videos on the topic because her \u201cproof\u201d of Sevyn not having matted hair and other \u201cproof\u201d she tried to debunk was comedic and ridiculous. She never has any decent pics of sevyn before their passing and everything is a screenshot of a video because she wasn\u2019t a present cat mom at all it seems. \n\nThere\u2019s also been a lot of other controversies of Rhegan lying and being an overall shitty person so honestly I\u2019m not shocked or surprised this happened. This whole stream just came off like the pod just wanted to protect the \u201cgirlies\u201d and just dog pile on the \u201cincel\u201d. Not cool. Really sad how everyone approached such a sad and sensitive topic. At the end of the day, Rhegan was responsible of HER cat and should have never let their poor pet get that bad where someone felt they needed to intervene. Anyways\ud83d\ude14 \n\nRIP Sevyn. The true baby and victim of this horrible situation.",
            "I\u2019m surprised they chose to talk about this after they just discussed in a recent ep how people are having a hard time watching the more serious topics",
            "Ideas for content that aren't 2 hours of animal abuse litigation:\n\n- Put a go pro on Ducky (corner camera)\n- Dan teaches Olivia Warhammer 40k (12 hour stream)\n- Piss challenge\n- Watch Air Bud In Silence. Lights Out",
            "The way Hila acted this episode was absolutely gross. Willing to put this dude over so much scrutiny but not the woman clearly not taking care of her fucking cat. Then she has the audacity to say he knows nothing about taking care of cats? Hila, you don\u2019t know shit about it, clearly.",
            "The end of the episode just felt like they were playing Among Us. Not cool and kinda disrespectful to the dude who actually went there and showed face for his actions.\nMeanwhile no accountability for the owner who did nothing but play victim.\n\nDon't let idiots adopt pets ...",

            "I really wish this topic hadn't been covered the entire episode, it was too difficult to watch for this long.",
            "the way this woman dodges responsibility for living with 10 other people and doesn't even refer to her own cat by name? did you even take YOUR OWN cat to the vet after you keep admitting it was sick?   \nThe fact that Jacob spent $600 to get tests after 3 days, and talked to other people in the house (and later his Mom) about taking Seven into his care because of the abuse leads me to believe that people were all hesitant to get involved, but they needed to intervene.  \nMy theory is this new guy was concerned and probably didn't want to cause any awkward confrontation about animal abuse to  someone he lived with, worked with AND possibly hooked up with in the past without tarnishing his job/reputation or embarrassing anyone. he had experience taking care of a cat and probably underestimated how sick the cat was (also probably due to conversations with Reghan saying Seven was sick all the time). Getting a cat to the vet in 3 days during covid is way more than 9 other people did in that house for that cat.  I think he also probably has some resentment for reghan with how she acting during the time he had to deal with it. This guy was fucking stupid for not communicating with her at all but IMO i do this he had the best intentions.\n\nSo so sad but what the fuck is up with Ethan and Hila's attitude towards this guy when Reghan has so many red flags (that other people also vouch for)?\n\n  \nSide note: Content houses need HR department",
            "This girl is obviously wrong to some degree (provided every ounce of charity that I can muster), and they\u2019re inviting her on the show while criticizing the guy who did the right thing\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve never heard so many irrelevant points and suppositions without merit before in my life. \u201cThe cat definitely weighed way more 4 days earlier\u201d\u2026literally wtf are you talking about Ethan, you think the cat lost 3 lbs in 4 days? This is hard to watch",
            "MEDICAL NEGLECT IS NEGLECT. \n\nAnd we KNOW that the cat was medically neglected from Rhegan herself. Josh did the right thing despite the means being questionable.",
            "It was extremely frustrating  to watch the  crew analyze and critique the  actions of  the man who saved the cat more closely than the person who abused it to  begin with. I actually was shocked to hear some of  the comments made. Crew members saying things like \"the  cat dying two days after  it  was rescued is suspicious\" or  \"maybe taking the cat to a different  environment made things worse.\" (obviously paraphrasing) I understand these people don't have abuse training, but  when you  come across an animal or  a child being  abused by their caretaker,  you absolutely  do  not try and  convince  the  abuser to do better.  You  Absolutely do remove them from the abusive environment and take them to a professional who can treat their condition, which is  exactly what the young  man did. The first  thing you do is provide  SAFETY for the  victim and then begin treatment. You don't see a living thing  suffering and try to argue with the victim's ABUSER to take better care of  it. Honestly the speculations  that he may have made the situation worse or  even  had bad intentions coming from certain crew members was  disturbing and gross. His mom was right, at least the cat died  around someone who cared about it. And then the comment about changing it?s environment, sure maybe it would have suffered longer and died a  few days later alone in a closet had he not rescued it, but it should  go without  saying that is not  a better outcome!",
            "This is the saddest episode and the most out of touch Ethan and Hila have ever been. Left a bad taste in my mouth.\nRIP Sevyn",
            "Hot take but I don\u2019t think he deserves the intense third degree. I do think he was careless but he tried to do the right thing even if it\u2019s too late",
            "I would rather hear them talk about literally anything else",
            "I was pretty harsh on the dude before, and I'm still think he did some things wrong, but Ethan's going off a little too much. What are we doing lol. \n\nChat was out for blood and they got it.",
            "I really hope Ethan and the crew see how bad these takes and decisions were. Please apologize to Jacob for attacking him, his intentions and coming up with wild irrelevant theories. Please do NOT platform the animal abuser in this situation. We do not need to hear any more sides. Let Sevyn Rest in Peace.\n\n1. Why would you ever show animals suffering/dying/dead and think that\u2019s something entertaining or part of the bit. This is really distasteful in my opinion to Sevyn \u2014 a once living creature. How would you feel if this were your pet? I can\u2019t watch things like this, let alone thinking about someone playing videos of them suffering in the way it was done on today\u2019s episode in such a trivial/distasteful manner which discredits the animal and animal\u2019s life. \n\n2. Animal suffering and abuse is not fun, \u201cdrama\u201d or something we should be discussing with the tone of todays episode\n\n3. You should not be defending the animal abuser and then aggressively coming after someone who was misguided but at least was trying to help. This girl let her cat suffer for 4 months, at the very least she was very neglectful. Your cat should not be repeatedly sick and never go to the vet. WTH? The cat weighed 3.8 lbs when finally taken to the vet? That is a cat that has been suffering for a prolonged period of time, and without any vet visit or true care? Disgusting. \n\n4. The speculation and wild theories and assumptions being made were out of line and frankly just not at all appropriate for this topic\n\nI usually don\u2019t comment on things. I have watched the podcast since 2020 and I never have been left with such a bad taste in my mouth from an episode. I genuinely like everyone on the crew and Ethan and Hila. This episode like some sort of twilight zone echo chamber. I would expect the cat owners on this Pod to have better takes. And Ethan and Hila having dogs and going through Shredder\u2019s illness and passing, imagine shredder going through that with a neglectful owner. All the time you spent researching what he can and can\u2019t eat, trying different foods to get him to eat. I\u2019ve been there. It\u2019s all consuming, because we care and we just want them to be happy and healthy and \u201cbetter\u201d. Sevyn was suffering and did not have pet parents like that. I know you are dog lovers. Please also extend this to being animal lovers. If you are so ignorant on a topic, then maybe try to not make wild assumptions and theories and go off of vibes. This situation is sad, and depressing and this episode did not help anyone. Please do better.",

            "I know people were very against the video being shown but I want to point out that the cat seemed very comfortable with him and not traumatized like Hila wanted to hold onto so deeply. Yes, some cats have a hard time readjusting to new environments but not everyone. In the video the cat leans into his petting which to me, who has owned cats, indicates that it trusted him to some degree. Cats that do not want to be around people, especially when sick, will find a place to hide. Cats are especially known for hiding when they are sick and yet this cat looked comfortable with him.",

This is people pointing out the blatant hypocrisy of two \u201canimal lovers\u201d excusing the abuse of an innocent kitten, meanwhile asking to see the literal corpse of said kitten as if they wouldn\u2019t be horrified to see the same image if it were a dog.\n\nLook inward.

            "A 9 month old cat does not get to 3 pounds after a few days. That is the result of an extended period neglect/sickness.

He shouldn\u2019t have taken the cat from its owner that\u2019s for sure, but you could imagine a young person seeing an animal in that state would think they are doing the right thing.\n\nThe way that Ethan and Hila were harping on 4 days that he tried to care for it on his own before taking it to a vet, then hanging onto the idea that this was done on purpose due to a crush/previous relationship???? Absolutely insane end to the episode after going through all the evidence against the owner.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have stolen the cat. But the owner should never have let the cat get to a state where someone felt that stealing it would help, at least he tried to do something. Just insane the way the opinion turned so heavily on him.\n\nAlso, this was meant to be a reply to another post that expressed disappointment with the tone shift at the end of the episode, but the post has conveniently disappeared, along with others that I saw and upvoted.\n\nBless Olivia for trying for always offering grace!",

Why would she think the cat would be safe and comfortable in a content house of all places? I would never do that to an animal I just adopted, especially one with recent health issues. Just wait until you\u2019re done filming to adopt or have it stay with family until you get back.",
            "Here's my understanding:\nThe cat was frequently sick, noticed by the owner, her boyfriend at the time and other friends (hearsay but apparently confirmed through Jacob's 1st hand account). Despite this, she never had it taken to a vet. Her housemate/s, acting impulsively, took the cat, thinking it was merely starving and one tried to take care of it with his mom's help. Seeing its condition worsen, he scheduled a vet appointment and paid for it out of his own pocket, but the cat died soon after.\n\nThis, to me, suggests the cat was already seriously ill when taken. Despite the wrongful act of stealing it, the cat\u2019s rapid death implies it was already (allegedly) very sick under the original owner's care.\n\nAlright, some thoughts:\nThe criticism the guy received for trying his best to handle a difficult situation was unfair. While taking the cat was wrong, it was probably already in poor condition and would've died quicker if nobody took action. In fact, we might not have even learned of this issue as it would have been swept under the rug. The focus should also be on the person who had the cat for months before. Blaming 4 days of inaction over 4+ months of (alleged) neglect is unreasonable.\n\nFrom the start, her behavior seemed suspicious. Her calmness about the pet\u2019s disappearance, despite being accused of its death, seemed odd. She appeared more annoyed that people were bringing up the cat than distressed. Her emotions only surfaced when people began confirming the rumors via Jacob's statement, making her seem guilty (for me).\n\nAdditionally, the romance theory is irrelevant and distracts from the real issue of responsibility for the cat's condition. It has no bearing on who was at fault and only muddles the discussion about the cat\u2019s care and eventual death.",
            "Literally would have preferred 3 hours of random talk /random anything rather than this mess that became at the end. I was enjoying the episode but towards the end not really",
            "I feel like they leaned too hard on him for the \u201cwaiting 4 days to take the cat in\u201d. I understand why: if he thought the cat was DYING RIGHT NOW and that\u2019s why he took it, then of course it would be strange that he wouldn\u2019t head straight to an animal hospital.\n\nBut he was trying(poorly) to explain - according to him, he took the cat because he thought it appeared generally, habitually, neglected. Not because he thought it needed an emergency vet visit. He took it thinking it needed proper husbandry, then later realised it actually needed urgent vet care. \n\nAnyway this segment was demented and it annoyed me so much it went all the way around to being entertaining again",
            "How on earth can you all forget that she neglected the cat HE WAS SICK ALOT never visited the vet. Thats why she killed it. Also the guy might be weird but he tried. The owner did nothing a stranger tried. But sure he might be an incel so fuck him??? How was this the conclusion???",

            "Rhegan killed her cat plain and simple. She left it suffering for MONTHS. Can any animal lover/pet owner say that they noticed their pet is sick and then waited more an a week to take it in for check up? No, no they cant. Because to leave an animal suffering is an evil that most people don't have in their soul. There's videos where her cat seizing in the background while she is vlogging, she's repeatedly said that her cat \"keeps getting sick\" and never got it checked, and multiple people from the house she lived in say she never fed it. That poor guy just wanted to help, he saw an animal suffering and did what he thought was best. Content house people aren't known for being the brightest, but that being said I don't think there's many people who would've done something different. People saying he stole the cat too fast blows my mind, people break dogs out of cars for less than what that cat was going through. His timeline matches up as well. He took the cat initially thinking it was malnourished, he tried feeding it for a few days and while caring for it he came to the realization that there's something more going on. After he realizes the cat needs medical help Jacob and his MOTHER try and take the cat to an emergency room. COVID times were hard for people and pets when it came to medical care, and medical staff were tired and overworked. When people are overworked their performance gets sloppy, that is a fact. They most likely realized the wait was going to be the same regardless of what vet they took Sevyn to and chose to go with the more reliable option, that being a private vet. Cats cannot go from healthy to severely malnourished in 4 days, that's just not possible. Even if it took a week for this guy to get the cat seen by someone, the state it was in is solely Rhegan's responsibility FULL STOP. Rhegan777 neglected, abused, and starved her cat Sevyn. She deserves hell.",
            "Ethan and especially Hila owe Jacob an apology. Insane to assume he only did this because he must\u2019ve been secretly in love with her (instead of just being genuinely concerned for the cat). \n\nAnd Ethan saying it\u2019s weird they weren\u2019t on good terms\u2026maybe Jacob didn\u2019t like Rhaegan cuz of how she treated her cat/people/things he observed while in the house. It\u2019s not that hard to comprehend. Maybe she was just a bad person. Not that he was attracted to her. \n\nHope they address this Monday and don\u2019t ignore it like they always do with bad takes. But whatever\u2026 I won\u2019t be watching anymore anyways.",

FIP is a brutal fatal disease, the treatment he mentioned requires several daily vet visits, only an owner who is truly committed to their pet would commit to such a treatment. \nI agree that he should've had a conversation before deciding to take the cat, but ultimately I do think he was acting in good faith and did not deserve the negative speculation.",

But the vet said to euthanize it, four/five days in his care is not going to put it in that state. The death is her fault! She neglected the cat to the point the advice given was to put it down. She killed the cat. I feel crazy seeing them entertain that it was his fault.",

She had the money and never took the poor thing to the vet and she suffered for weeks. The audacity for her to keep mentioning that the roommate recording the cat while she was seizing is so much worse than what she did.

I have cats of my own and foster cats, that cat was presumably growing out of kitten hood into what should be sustained growth(based on the image of its adoption date and the vet documents) but the cat didn\u2019t grow into a healthy weight under her care. I understand if someone saw a malnourished cat that they might make an instant decision to remove it from its environment. \n\nThere is clear neglect that happened under the owners care, she shouldn\u2019t be given an out because the strange catnapper guy created a lie around the disappearance of the cat. He\u2019s impulsive in stealing the cat but he did what the owner didn\u2019t do, take it to see a professional when it was clearly in bad shape. The neglect falls on the owner.

            "\u203c\ufe0fThis isnt the first time Ethan and Hila have done this\u203c\ufe0f\n I believe the discussion would\u2019ve gone ALOT differently if it was two girls or two guys involved. \n\nAs a 23 yr old woman,  I\u2019ve felt uncomfy in past pods with how they demand the ONLY POSSIBLE outcome is that the girl/woman is right. This isn\u2019t the first time one/both of them get verbally hostile as soon as someone communicates a different viewpoint (ex: Hila to Olivia in this ep)\n\nHila defends her opinions with, \u201c I don\u2019t trust him\u201d but I agree with Dan. Why is she trusting HER SO HARD  in this situation. \n\u2022Hila also says, \n\u2022\u201cFor me it\u2019s not that I\u2019m trusting her more\u2026\u201d \u2757\ufe0fThat\u2019s absolutely what she\u2019s doing.\n\u2022\u201c\u2026it\u2019s just that he\u2019s the one that stole a pet and made that decision\u201d \n\u2757\ufe0fI agree that he could\u2019ve handled it differently but he MADE THE DECISION to take seven to the vet. YES it took him days but SHE had WEEKS/MONTHS to do the same and neglected to do so.",
            "Ethan and Hila disappointed tf out of me today. When gross, problematic, Bobby Lee cancelled I was stoked for a fun Friday show, but instead got 4 hours + of garbage takes across the board. Good thing Ethan and Hila didn't end up getting a kitten. They obviously find them lesser beings than dogs. Grim.",
            "I have to wonder how Ethan and Hila would feel if it was an emaciated dog vs a cat. I left my cat with someone who was meant to look after her, and she lost heaps of weight when I came back! Clearly not being fed properly, but not enough to kill her. She fattened back up when I took her home. This cat was clearly unwell, and she ignored that. Everyone but Olivia has such a bad take. \nHila has the worst take. I\u2019m so disappointed in her.",
            "I can\u2019t think of a single topic or segment that could justifiably take the whole episode. Not even my personal favorites or the crowd favorite fun segments should take the whole episode. Watching this show for years I can\u2019t remember an entire episode dedicated to 1 topic, especially not something like the \u201cdrama\u201d surrounding the literal death of a pet.\n\nGenuinely asking, did anyone enjoy this episode?",
            "I can't listen to animal abuse stories",
            "Imagine if someone said Shredder died because they didn't get him care \"fast enough.\" \n\nMy 12 year old dog, who was the love of my life, just passed from cancer, and my cat died in 2021 from a heart defect. We could not get her into any vet & went to 4 emergency vets before one would take her in. We waited hours in the car due to covid at every ER vet, they'd come out with masks on, take a look at her, and say \"she'll be ok until you get into the regular vet\", which was weeks later. We did everything we could until we finally found an ER vet to get her into - they said she was literally in heart failure, and she died days later.",
            "I thought the doc was an ever growing content resource... Why resort to a last minute unprepared segment that no one wants to see? I usually think people overreact way too hard in chat/the sub but man I get it this time, almost been 2 hours of nothing but animal abuse talk....",
            "Good god this is a terrible episode. I miss OG After Dark vibes",
            "They went so hard into conspiracy on the guy. Is it that crazy he didn\u2019t want to say they hooked up one time on live? That makes him an incel? And the pushing that he hurt the cat by taking it, and he was the cause of its death, is insane. It\u2019s fucked to spread something so terrible about him with no basis. We SAW the cat sick a month prior and she did nothing. It was so ill, he had it for three days trying to resuscitate it and the vet said to put it down. That is FAR gone. It was super distasteful the way they treated him, when the owner was literally abusing her animal. Olivia & Dan had the only down to earth perspective, but Hila instantly shuts down anyone with differing views and is an ass about it. So there\u2019s no chance for a real discussion with her there. Not to mention it allows Ethan to be completely off base with no correction.",

But\u2026what the actual fuck was this entire episode. As a cat owner this was a ridiculously hard watch\u2026showing the video of that helpless emaciated kitten seizing?? Hila being more concerned about \u201cproperty theft\u201d than literal animal abuse??? Switching sides to take this deranged girls defense the minute she donated, to GRILLING that well-intentioned,albeit flustered, kid who tried rescuing a clearly ill and dying cat while he was trying to explain himself???? Imagine the guilt he already feels about that, like he needs humiliation on top of it. \n\nThe entire conversation would have been wildly different if this was a story about a yorkie that came from a backyard breeder. Peace and love was not in the room with us lol.. All I can say is YIKES. Whole thing made me sick and left an awful taste in my mouth\u2026animal abuse, or neglect for that matter, isn\u2019t a joke.\n\nThank fucking god for Olivia if I keep watching she will be the only reason.",

He's just babbling about nonsense and interrupting AB every 30 seconds to make some dumbass comment. Shit like this is why I haven't tuned in lately. I know he's done this forever but after not listening for a while it's super annoying as a viewer trying to stay engaged with the topic when the host won't stop babbling and derailing the conversation over and over again. Like please just stfu for 5 seconds and save your questions/comments until the end bro damn lol\n\nETA a good example: AB's explaining what's happening in the video, of course Ethan's talking and not listening again. So he has to ask AB to explain what he was literally just explaining when Ethan was busy babbling. Then Ethan asks if he'll just start the video over again.. Then Ethan starts babbling AGAIN while the video is playing so he has to ask AB to start it over again. This is literally less than 20 mins into the video. Like wth dude? How could anyone stay interested in this content when the host himself can't stay focused on the topic. \n\nI know they have before, but someone from the crew needs to say something to him. Or at least have him watch the segment back and see how fucking annoying it is. It really just makes Ethan come off as a self-important asshole.",

You had no content for today and you end up deciding to pick on the person who holds the least responsibility for this cat as well as coming up with speculations about him, also calling him an incel for no reason??? I\u2019m truly disappointed and expect a real apology on Monday \n\nPeace and love",
            "What the fuck? You guys really lost the plot on this one. Except for Olivia. Hila was throwing blind emotion this dudes way, Ethan was bending over backwards to twist this into a toxic male thing, or attempting a gotcha. Whatever it was, it was off base. Not an indictment on this entire show!!! but some of the worst tendencies were coming out today. \n\nDesperately need a refresh gaff episode. Bobby Lee caused this by falling off his bed.",

            "This episode almost had me grind my teeth into nubs.\n\nTake Jacob out of the equation, she didn't take her clearly sick *kitten* to the vet! When she had a shit ton of money to do so! And then she doesn't put posters up or call local shelters to find her lost KITTEN?!\n\nEthan and Hila were basically implying he took a healthy cat and killed it. Hila literally said there was no sign of neglect/abuse, when there clearly was, they just watched videos of the cat shitting in the bed! And the boyfriend saying the cat is always sick! Kittens don't just have get colds and get over them, they have a much more weakened immune system and any sickness needs to be addressed by a vet *immediately*. And having a kitten in a loud house with a shit ton of people around before she's gotten all of her vaccines is incredibly irresponsible. \n\nSure, the dude is weird and should have talked to her first, but for the whole crew (minus Olivia) to just talk shit about Jacob after he had the guts to call in for a 2 v 1, calling him an incel, that he stole the cat for clout, or to be the hero, is so fucking gross. Getting a cat to a new vet in 4 days is insanely fast. I've never been so disgusted by the crew like this before. I had no idea who the dude was until today, so I'm not a fan defending him or anything, but they absolutely need to apologize to him. They were shitting on the one person who cared about the cat enough to take her to the vet. Fucking wild.",
            "How dare he judge her for going out and partying when her cat was lost. Are they high? I cried and cried for days when I lost my cat and was doing everything to find her. She is a bad person!!! She neglected her cat and when she thought it was lost she did not care.",

They are like children, their health and wellness rests on my shoulders, why would i let them suffer. To do that to any animal is horrific and he was right in taking that cat. To stand by is to be complicit. This is my favorite podcast and i typically refrain from criticism as mostly i find people blow little things out of proportion. But this was truly vile and delusional. I am 100% certain their views would change if it were a dog which is disgusting. Get a grip i beg",
            "How is Ethan not getting that the incentive Jacob had was to save the cats life? Yes the cat died, but he tried to do something after its owner neglected it for so long. No good deed goes unpunished I guess.",

            "I don't understand any of the nonsense about what this guy did being wrong. If I see your animal in this condition and I have any reason to believe that it is due to neglect, I don't care anything about you. I'm not going to ask permission, I'm not going to warn you, I'm not going to return the cat to you after saving it. \n\nWhat he did is good and right. Nothing about it is psycho or weird. Her neglecting her car to that point is psycho and weird.",

            "this episode genuinely made me sick to my stomach. as a long time cat owner i was disgusted by the crew\u2019s comments and opinions on this whole situation. the fact is that this cat was sick for a long time and nothing was done about it. rhegan 100% neglected that poor cat. what pisses me off is that the crew seemed to be putting more blame and hate on the one person who actually tried to save the cat. rhegan had multiple chances to take the cat to the vet and she did not. and let\u2019s be for real if you saw an animal being neglected by its owner what would you do? would you just let it continue to be neglected just because it is not your pet? no i\u2019m sure any animal lover would do anything to get that pet out of that situation.",

            "Seems like an Occam's Razor situation. He probably thought this cat was dying because it was sick, he'll try to save it, but his care wasn't the best because he's not as familiar with cats or this particular cat. There was probably an underlying health issue.",

            "I didn\u2019t watch the episode..  but did they at any point do a poll like, does anyone want to hear about this or should we just shoot the shit for a few hours? I would have totally watched a full ep of everyone just talking, watching fav tik toks, eating and goofin.",
            "also are we missing the point that he took the cat to the vet when he clearly didn\u2019t have to! its not his cat at all! how long it took him shouldn\u2019t matter it wasn\u2019t his responsibility..the cat was clearly sick when she adopted him so why didn\u2019t she take him to the vet? HELLO?? if my cat is sick i\u2019d take it to the vet asap get that appointment in ASAP",
            "worst h3 ep of all time. i\u2019d have rather listened to Ethan talk about the Palestinian genocide for 4 hours.",
            "Hey so like when y'all apologized for all the heavy topics why does it seem like we're getting an influx of way more heavy topics?\n\nDid yall forget about goofs and gaffs to just cover things that make us upset or- did I miss something",
            "after having this episode on in the background, I wish I was the cat it would be better than another 10 minutes of this",
            "I hopped on to the show late and as soon as it started heading in the dead cat story direction I rolled out. My mental health would only take a dive from listening to that shit.",
            "I\u2019m going to save myself the stress and just skip this episode of the podcast \ud83d\ude05",
            "Sort comments by \"Best\" vs. sort comments by \"Top\" and it's like two different comment sections.",
            "this story is super heart-breaking. what i took from it is basically that both rhegan and the guy who took her were very neglectful, but at least the guy attempted to nurse the cat back to being healthy. but what i don't get is him waiting 4-5 days to take her to the vet and covering up the fact that he took her by saying she ran away. that's fucked up regardless of intentions. \n\nwhile yes i think he would be a better owner than rhegan, the people dying on the hill of defending him don't make sense to me either.\n\nbasically, if you aren't very comfortable and 100% certain that you can handle the commitment of a pet, don't do it. please, please, just wait, for the pet's sake and for yours.",
            "It takes a long time for a cat to show their sickness so it would have been suffering for a while but if you are a good owner you\u2019ll see the signs even if subtle. By the time he took it in it would have been too late from her neglect. Im a first time pet/cat owner but As soon as one of mine is acting strange at all it\u2019s an immediate phone call and/or vet appointment (and we have had to treat stuff from those on a whim appointments) \n\nAlso we don\u2019t know the dynamic of the house, sure we could argue he was wrong for taking it on the low but also if your watching an owner \u2018abuse/neglect\u2019 their animal for a while there is a feeling of danger and wanting to \u2018save\u2019 the animal especially if it\u2019s quickly deteriorating. Poor little Seven.",
            "Yikes. Big yikes.",
            "Bro they flipped on her so hard for $5",
            "My post got deleted and was advised to instead discuss it here. So here\u2018s my post again:\n\nI feel that they treated the guy trying to save the cat WAY too harshly. \n\nWith P&L I simply thought that after the 5$ Superchat came in they fully switched sides and they made tons of assumptions and did everything to try and nitpick in order to find anything to criticise the guy for. He seemed like a good person at heart to me, like he actually tried saving the cat, and instead the abuser is being defended because of a 5$ donation. P&L P&L Would love to hear thoughts about this.",
            "Anyone have the timestamp for when they stop talking about the animal abuse stuff? Or how far roughly into the livestream it is? With peace and love to Ab, and credit to him for bringing something to the table at the last moment; this is no slight to him, but that topic ain't for me.",
            "3h about this is 2h59min too long",
            "why is ethan actually mean to ab tho  like thats his employee",
            "This was terrible to watch. :( I am an RVT and a cat owner of 30+ yrs. Based on the little info provided, this cat appeared to have a condition like feline distemper or FIP which are both absolutely devastating diseases. They can both be very quick to progress but it is not overnight and the symptoms are not even close to something you could chalk up to as \"just a cold.\" The owner is 100% at fault! Zero room for doubt! Should the person who took the cat have documented it better? Yes. But he did not cause the issue. The cat was likely incubating the sickness before she was even adopted. It is the owner's fault for ignoring her symptoms.",
            "With peace and love, there were multiple issues with this episode, and I think the Bobby canceling contributed. Please have Crew Storytime prepared as a backup for situations like this. Have a topic ready and the crew can jot notes to jog their memory. We got cut off by Diamond before and instead of 4 hours of cat neglect time today, we could have had chill fun stories. No doc needed! AB isn't stressed! More comfy episode time!",
            "Really boring and unentertaining segment. Plus who wants to hear about animal abuse?",
            "rare hila L\n\npets shouldn't be treated like property, if one is being mistreated/abused it is 100% acceptable for someone who ISNT the owner to remove from the property and take it to the vet",

            "I'll comment when the animal stuff segment is over, for those of you who don't want to hear it.",
            "I can't believe they're still talking about the cat. We're going to discuss animal abuse for 2 hours? They really need to learn how to wrap up a segment. This one is somehow both very upsetting AND boring. It's almost impressive.",
            "I stopped watching at the beginning hoping they would be done with the cat stuff by now but they\u2019ve juiced the topic for a whole 2 hours :/",

            "Ethan choosing and encouraging to show a video of a dead cat is kind of insane. I don\u2019t know that he\u2019d do the same if it were a dog",
            "They are both in the wrong. She neglected her cat, he stole it with the intention of getting it help but also kinda failed his duty of care and comes off a tad psycho.",
            "I know AB squeezed this story to fill in for Bobby but this was such a nothing burger. The girl sucks for not taking the cat to the vet and the dude sucks for stealing the cat. Boom story done, how is this the longest pod we\u2019ve gotten in over a month\u2026\u2026\u2026..",

            "\"That man is playing Galaga. Thought we wouldn't notice, but we did.\"",
            "I felt like they were trying to imply that the cat died because of something he did, and that bothers me. If I were in his position and took the cat thinking I would be able to save it and it passed due to someone else\u2019s neglect, and then the public turned it onto me saying it was MY fault I would be outraged\u2026",
            "Ethan doesn't know fuck all about cats and often comes into situations with an ABSURD confirmation bias. It's almost like he sees what would make more drama instead of what is reality sometimes and just goes too far with it. This absolute bullshit is TOO FAR.",
            "Ethan needed something to happen this interview, i think he wanted to get him, to make the show more interesting, he knew this episode was crap. I dont think he cared about what was true.",
            "Honestly thank god for those 2 level headed queens.",
            "IKR. It was so much speculation and its like...she said they were dating he said they weren't. idk why they immediately took her word as truth without her providing any evidence or asking for evidence. This was kinda like the Daisy Fit Coconuts situation, both were bad people...but one they took word for...which some came out to be lies. \n\nI'm happy Dan did interject and say we don't know whos telling the truth and were speculating.",
            "She was clearly neglectful",
            "Yes because OBVIOUSLY the most reasonable explanation is that this guy stole the cat as a prank and it ended up dying so he panicked, faked a vet bill, leaked the story on reddit, got other tiktokers to back up the claims about her neglecting the cat, knowing he\u2019d be asked to call into the show 3 years later\u2026.for clout. \ud83d\ude44",
            "This was something I was wondering too. It wasnt clear if she had EVER taken the cat for the vet. For both dogs and cats, usually you\u2019re at the vet a few times in the first year of having them for all their vaccines, neuter / spay, and all that other shit. \n\nSo I\u2019m wondering the same thing because when I rescued my cat at 6 years old, part of the adoption contract was taking him and his papers from the shelter to my personal vet within 60 days or something like that, and for kittens it was required to take them to your personal vet within 30 days.",
            "Another thing I want to add here is that before Jacob came out and confirmed it was the cat in the photos, Rhegan was under the impression that it wasn\u2019t her cat. Now obviously the cat is quite unique looking\u2026 and it has a notch in its ear. You 100% can tell that it\u2019s her cat in the photos and videos, and as a pet owner if my cat got lost I would be looking for him everywhere and I would be able to recognize my fucking cat that I love so dearly. How on earth does her cat run away, she sees photos of the damn thing and she says to herself \u201cnope not my cat that I lost and never found\u201d.\n\nShe also allegedly went to a party the night her cat \u201cescaped\u201d like.. \n\nI think she was in irresponsible teen, who got a cat. And only got a cat for the novelty of having a pet. Didnt realize the care that the cat needed and neglected it. Like let\u2019s be honest here she barely had photos of the cat to begin with\u2026 she\u2019s in a tiktok party house, she was definitely not with the cat taking care of it 24/7. She wasn\u2019t some homebody quirky girl who loves her kitty and crocheted on the weekends..",
            "Ya it\u2019s inexcusable",
            "i think the guy taking the cat is strange and waiting 4 days (as he mentions he couldn\u2019t go on the weekend so possibly only 2 days he didn\u2019t make effort to go and just find a vet to take her in)   but i think the real issue is rhegan not ever taking her into the vet. she talks about how seven would be very sick and then be fine. wouldn\u2019t that be even weirder to not take it to the vet. also she had the cat for 4 months? and never once brought it to the vet (as it seems) even thought it was claimed seven was sick constantly (like the ex said that the cat needs to stop being sick or whatever he said)   i think both are in the wrong but i think rhegan is clearly worse off in this situation.",
            "The tone shift gave me whiplash",
            "I feel like if anything, when it's your first pet you should be quicker to run to the vets when something is wrong. When something is wrong with my pet I'm at the vets the next day if it's not an emergency.",
            "and diarrhea is such a cause of concern for kittens and should\u2019ve been a major red flag since it could lead to dehydration which can be fatal for kittens. i can\u2019t with this story\ud83d\ude2d",
            "100% I've been a religious listener/viewer since the Vape Nation days and today's ep was the first time I was genuinely upset with the crew. The uncalled for aggressiveness during the interview and crazy speculation with no evidence. Basically, ignoring Js explanations and backing R who is the only one you can 100% say mistreated the Cat. They gave her all the leeway in the world but jumped at J any chance they got. \n\nMinus Olivia and Dan for trying to remain fair. \n\nEthan and Hila should be ashamed.",
            "They were so hostile towards him when his explanation makes perfect sense. He initially took the cat thinking it was just malnourished. Upon spending a\u00a0 day or so with the cat he realized it was more sick than he thought so he took it to the vet (something Rhegan never did). The vet said the cat was basically dying. Taking the cat the way he did was odd but I think his intentions were good.",
            "Agreed",
            "He for sure had good intentions.\u00a0",
            "Yeah I feel like they should only speculate when it\u2019s clear it\u2019s a joke and Zach plays the conspiracy music",
            "Wow, everything I hear about Chewy is really great. I love that they offer that to everyone.",
            "I am not certain he was wrong. If the cat wasn't properly cared for, I think there is justification in taking it. He claims it wasn't cared for, others have claimed they heard it wasn't cared for, 4 days after he took it the vet said it need to be put down because of its poor condition. She says it was fine.",
            "Yes",
            "the fact that the hehe pod is defending her is making it worse.",
            "They probably can't hear you over the sound of their $12k fridge running",
            "There\u2019s a list for sure",
            "100%. if i knew about a cat being constantly poorly, malnourished and not being taken to the vets - that is a good presumption that it will not be taken to the vets. yes, he definitely should\u2019ve not have just taken it, but i can understand that he wouldn\u2019t want to talk to her about it - if she was going to take it to the vets, she would\u2019ve. i\u2019m sure the cat would\u2019ve died in the content house (possibly alone?) but instead a good effort was made to look after her and save her. again, there were better options but i totally believe he did what he thought was best in that moment - and so did the other people he was with. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
            "Plus, I feel like it wasn't about the wait...Jacob mentioned something about the quality of care his cat had received after waiting in the pet ER on a different occasion. So instead, he wanted to get in for a real appointment for Sevyn since the cat seemed in such bad condition. I think he had a hard time articulating himself because Ethan and Hila were interrogating him so aggressively.",
            "I don't want to aound like a snowflake but the way Hila speculated about him and how she called him a fucking incel and didn't acknowledge that it was Reagan's fault is so fucking gross and pathetic. like honestly fuck that.",
            "Like for reals hila keeps harping on it being stressful for the cat to be taken to a new place. Imagine that house filled with 10 plus stupid young influencers running around constantly and then moving like 3 other times before even getting to the house",
            "it was lmao",
            "Way too hostile with that poor guy. He seemed well intentioned. Pretending the cat ran away was weird but her doing nothing to try and find it was a lot worse.",
            "At first I was intrigued with the impromptu call in, but then it started feeling like the og Jeff interview \ud83d\ude05",
            "All of the \u201cinterviews\u201d are just him cornering guests into submission. He talks to them in bad faith and asks  baited questions and only baited questions. The guests are in a lose-lose situation with every question he asks. They are more slam pieces or judgements without actually being an interview.  Personally I don\u2019t enjoy it. It\u2019s like writing hate mail, like all the subreddit drama he hates but actualized in real life. He\u2019s not trying to truly understand anyone. He\u2019s tunnel visioned.",
            "Dude took the cat on friday, gave him food and water on the weekend and was with it at the vet on monday 3 and 1/2 days later, what the fuck does Ethan mean \" Wasn't fast enough for the cat either\" , like FUCK YOU dude I'm so angry and frustrated at Ethan and I know I shouldn't but it's just fucking crazy thing to say. Scumbag.",
            "yeah i was surprised by her response to that. like yeah actually i am going to judge someone for that because it's awful",
            "Hila is incapable of not seeing these situations through her own lense it\u2019s so frustrating. No one is talking about stealing your dog and then them dying, this was a starving cat that had no food or water and had never been to a vet. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t giving incel, he was saying you don\u2019t deserve to know about the outcome if you abused your pet\u2026 how did the plot get so lost the conspiracy theories were so embarrassing",
            "Agreed, and there might have been justification to take the cat. 4 days after he took it, a vet said we should put it down due to its condition, that means it was in rough shape.",
            "Exactly! They\u2019re saying it was Jacob\u2019s fault because the cat died in his care but if you adopt a cat and it dies within 2 weeks, anyone would assume they were given a sick cat. \n\nAlso the vet was ready to put the cat down 4 days after he took it. Is a vet really gonna put down a cat just because it hasn\u2019t been eating for 4 days?",
            "Dan and Olivia had the sanest takes on this topic. I really can't understand why they took her side so hard it's really weird.",
            "At least with Daisy it made sense at the time",
            "Might go down in history as the worst episode",
            "the fact that the hehe pod is defending her is making it worse.",
            "Agree with you 100% and it is a very common and difficult to witness sentiment among dog exclusive pet-owners. The suffering of cats is not treated with the same level of empathy.",
            "Yes! I strongly believe H wouldn't be reacting the same way if it had been a dog.",
            "At least Olivia attempted a good take. She was a bit beat down for it though.",
            "Man, Love can have some crazy dumbfuck takes. I said it.",
            "Yeah I laughed hysterically when she showed \u201cproof\u201d his fur was normal when the first pic was all dark and the second pick just showed his head. Like girl who do you think you\u2019re fooling?!",
            "Absolutely, it\u2019s hard to watch them dogpile on him and call him an incel, he doesn\u2019t deserve that at all. Completely unfair coverage of the situation.",
            "The accidents at Disney was a better segment, than this 4 hour episode on a dead cat..",
            "number 2 is such an awesome idea",

            "2 hours? try 4",
            "It\u2019s overdone but I\u2019d love to watch the crew play Among Us",
            "I\u2019m very intrigued by piss challenge. Longest range? Maximum velocity? Color?",
            "I hate to agree with this because i love the show and crew,  but i was caught off guard by their take. Especially hila saying he gives off \"incel vibes\" because he criticized her for partying instead of watching her sick baby..",
            "As Hila has learned to come out of her shell more, we unfortunately realize the true her is not a nice nor good person",
            "Yeah I hate to say it but Hila was way off. He thought it just needed to be fed. After a couple days he realized it was far worse so he took it to the vet (something it's owner never did). The fkn vet said it should be put down.\u00a0 That likely didn't happen in the 4 days he had it. That sounds like the cat was sick under its owners care long before he came along. Don't get why Hila was jumping to so many conclusions.\u00a0",
            "That's a bit harsher than I would have put it but I get the sentiment. Her and Ethan both were going with what they wanted to believe from the beginning instead of looking of the facts and working outward. \n\nObligatory longtime fan, first time poster, but this was the hardest episode to watch in a long time for me. I love Hila, but she commands the room when she gets passionate about something. Awesome on good takes, not so great on bad takes. She had everyone swayed by the end and it was pretty insufferable. The only real winner was Dan because he stayed out of the majority of it. He's a good man.\n\nBut like everything they said tonight, this is just my speculation.",
            "Them not knowing anything but talking shit is becoming a defining feature of the show. \n\nIt\u2019s getting really depressing. Was my favourite show but they can be so god damn arrogant sometimes.\n\nI get that they\u2019re upset by the subject matter, I get that it was a last minute segment choice to cover Bobby being unavailable, but they frequently have the worst fucking takes recently.",
            "I love that she didn't want to go on and for some reason was rewarded with their favor instead of the guy who actually tried to explain himself.",

            "Hopefully they read all of these comments and apologize to this kid. What a disappointing episode. Not funny, not entertaining, not reddit being Karens. This was bad.",
            "It's legitimately hard to watch. Them saying there's incel vibes because he said she didn't deserve to know, welp, she doesn't. The cat had never been to the vet and it's been sick long enough to be matted and emaciated. Olivia seems like the only one not completely off the rails rn.",
            "I find it absolutely crazy that they\u2019re putting most (if not all) of the blame on the guy when he actually took it to the vet. The girl had a sick cats for months and did nothing. I\u2019m not saying the guys methods were or is correct HOWEVER the fact that he actually took it to the vet and made sure it had food/water is WAY better.",
            "Also if the cat was so sick that the vet recommended it be put down right away if the cat was going to lose weight even if he was trying to help the cat. I am a bit behind but I hate that she is involved I don't want to hear anything she has to say, she was obviously negligent if not for not caring for the cat definitely for not taking the cat to the vet.",
            "Yeah this gets grosser by the minute. We\u2019re questioning why he took the cat and overlooking the fact that the CAT DIED\n\n\u201cDid you have any romantic interest in her\u201d\nBruh this is a gross implication\n\nAs I\u2019m typing this Ethan said \u201cthis led to the cat dying\u201d\u2026so now it is his fault? Absolutely wild",
            "The vet recommending that is a really good point that isn\u2019t being brought up enough. He didn\u2019t kill the cat in 3 days",
            "Also they completely missed the mark when they started focusing on Jacob\u2019s dating history. Totally irrelevant and speculative. That poor cat deserved so much more",
            "And it's even worse when you have the chat saying he behaves suspiciously just from his body language. Someone needs to say those people that body language reading is total bs",

            "Agreed.\nRest in peace, sevyn",

It just sucks when so many times they do it and the lady is full of shit and lying, telling them exactly what they wanna hear and then later, after everyone is done shitting on the naysayers, it comes out she WAS lying lol",

            "And he was completely right, at that time it was VERY difficult to get animals in to see a vet. Especially one that wasn\u2019t an existing patient. My vets office stopped taking new patients and existing patients had to be dropped off. They just started taking new patients and letting owners come in with their animals last year.",
            "All the speculation without basis that they piled on after getting off the call with him was really uncool. Just making up unfounded claims without a shred of evidence is out of pocket. Why give the kid a chance to speak for himself and then do an hour of speculation afterward that he can't defend against? Calling him an incel and saying he took the cat to get her attention is weird.\n\nAlso, FIP isn't contagious, so his cat having FIP wasn't a danger to Seven.",
            "Not to mention that before she knew it was her cat she denied that the cat from Reddit was hers. There was no drastic change that could\u2019ve taken place in that time to make her forget what her cat looked like and despite what the crew said, a cat would not lose weight that fast, it had to have already been significantly underweight. I have seen videos of people recognizing their pets that were lost and picked up by a shelter after months or even years apart, you don\u2019t forget what your pet looks like after four days unless you really weren\u2019t that invested.\n\nHer use of \u201cthe cat\u201d or \u201cit\u201d and the fact that her excuse for not posting about the cat or calling around to shelters was that the day of she yelled at the roommates and walked the neighborhood is insane. Even her crying pictures that were supposed to prove she cared overlapped with a break up so they technically could\u2019ve been about that and not the cat because nothing in them was specific. \n\nAlso for a cat to have an empty water bowl is just weird, cats usually take a while to finish a bowl of water and I know people that change out the water just so that they have fresh water before the bowl is seen empty. (and she downplayed their relationship by saying \u201che knows I don\u2019t fuck with him and how would he even know, he had just got there\u201d, acting like he was a stranger at the time, until she saw that Ethan pushed the angle that he was some kind of scorned lover and then suddenly she wants to talk about how they had something the very first week they moved in despite both of them immediately getting into other relationships \ud83d\ude10)",
            "But you don't understand, the months of her neglecting a sick cat don't matter, he's clearly a weird incel that's in love with her and took the cat to the vet to win her love!!! /s  \nThe only level headed one today was Dan as usual",
            "When was the last time the podcast even slightly criticized a woman at all? Even when she is so clearly in the wrong it doesn\u2019t matter cause she\u2019s a \u201cqueen\u201d and can\u2019t do nothing wrong. It\u2019s honestly so frustrating and isn\u2019t as progressive as they think it is.",
            "And he isn't wrong. My cat also had FIP, although a little further along in the pandemic, so things weren't quite as locked down. The emergency clinic in my town gave abysmal care. They were just awful, and it cost $800 to have them do basically nothing (we had mis-placed an injection, and the fluid migrated to Larry's neck. I panicked and took him in. He was fine).\n\nThe closest *decent* animal hospital/ER is an hour away, and the 2 times we took Larry in it was a 6+ hour ordeal plus drive time, and cost around $2k for two visits. That's a lot to ask of a kid who is 18-20 years old, especially for a cat that isn't his. I know he took responsibility the moment he took the cat, but I'm sure he never expected the cat to die just over a week later. He thought some food and love could save her. It's tragic that help came too late.",
            "the jeff one was at least a little funny iirc, this one is just cringe and sad. i feel simultaneously bad for and frustrated at everyone involved, i cant even get myself to laugh when ethan makes his usual remarks during debates bc this situation is so fucked",

            "True. Both she and Dan seemed the most level headed. She stopped speaking after it was clear hila wasn\u2019t agreeing with her (no hate to Oliv at all, I\u2019d be intimidated by my bosses having such a major reaction as well).",
            "Exactly! Can\u2019t forget the picture of him in the cardboard box that\u2019s also in the dark where you can barely see him or his fur yet she\u2019s claiming that as \u201cproof\u201d his fur wasn\u2019t matted\ud83e\udd72",
            "Exactly. They were just going off assumptions and theories instead of actual content Rhegan has provided already which is pretty damning in her case made me so frustrated. Like did the pod know that Rhegan also admitted to throwing her dog out of a 2 story window because she thought dogs could fly when she was younger?? There\u2019s just so much more research that needed to be done about her perspective on pets and being an owner that the pod didn\u2019t do which doesn\u2019t bring enough justice to Sevyn and let\u2019s Rhegan off the hook.. again.. Also the fact she didn\u2019t even wanna call in is a huge red flag as well. Sigh.",

There was literally no response that somebody could\u2019ve had to her that they would\u2019ve been deemed acceptable to them.

I don't want the guy to not try anymore in the future but he will have to do better. If he took a human child because he presumed after 5 minutes that the mother wasn't taking care of it and DIDN'T find out the child's prior medical issues OR take it to the doctor, then the child died under his care, he would be charged with manslaughter and kidnapping.

Sociopathic teens kept a cat as basically a prop for their unregulated influencer reality TV show. The cat was only in the house for a few months and died within two weeks of being taken out.\n\n\nThe owner was wrong for having the cat there in the first place. The guy was wrong for stealing the cat. The people who own the house and ran the show are wrong for letting the cat into the situation. No investigation needed, everything was fucked.

He didn't even confront her about the cat first! That seems like an obvious first step before immediately jumping to not only kidnapping the cat, which likely caused it a ton of stress, but literally conspiring to make it look like the cat ran away.

            "i care about all cats, but this is incredibly sad to talk about for 4 hours",
            "But what about the square footage of the room??!",
            "Same this episode is almost unwatchable for animal lovers. I can't watch Ethan back someone who abused an animal so badly. My heart is broken just writing this for that poor animal. Him asking to show it like I have seen in comments is messed up. I agree with other comments if it was his dog he would never !!!! I hope Ethan will see how this affected the fans",
            "ARE YOU SERIOUS that it\u2019s ALL they talk about???",
            "I agree. I am trying to make light of a much deeper issue.",
            "On a Friday show no less?!",
            "Haven't watched but damn 4 hrs?? Probably the last lengthy topic they talked about was the Ace Family house situation maybe?",
            "they probably covered it all ep because bobby canceled late and it\u2019s all they had planned",
            "Are you serious it\u2019s an entire 4 hours about cat abuse \ud83d\ude2d",

            "They\u2019re timing out anyone saying \u201ccan we move on\u201d or anything like that. I fell asleep having heard basically everything I need to hear about it, woke up 90 mins later, and they were still talking about it.",

            "4.5M on tiktok on the woman? I think that's enough to be considered not-nobody.\n\nThere's history of people liking \"deep dives\" on likes of Colleen, ACE family. And when they start getting \"live updates\" and people involved want to call in, can't act surprised it becomes this.",

            "To the tinfoil hat part:\nHe obviously is focusing more on his family now, which makes sense and is okay considering he has his kids and just added another newborn. But then just trying to sail on and force his way in the podcast the way he has just goes to show how much resentment ethan holds for his viewers.",

            "Yeah, I cancelled my membership over this.",
            "Same but it's not even the drama and tea, it's the horrible sa, pedaphila, domestic abuse, and now animal abuse stories. I understand these things matter but at this point, I don't understand who 3 hours of it is for.",
            "I know what converation you're talking about and remember him saying that \"dogs are a human's best friend\" and that cats are not capable of forming the same bonds since they mostly just lie around. As far as I am aware, Dan, AB/Lena, Love and Ian/Sam all have cats, which makes all of this even more depressing.\n\nAlso, I am so glad that Olivia (who doesn't even have a cat) and Dan weren't so hot-headed as to participate from the same point of view as Ethan, AB and Hila and towards the end of the show, when Ethan and Hila were making really intense assumptions, just advocated for the well-being of the animal. IT BLOWS MY MIND that this wasn't the conclusion they all arrived on right away and that the debate devolved into pure speculation for the better part of 4 hours.\n\nImagine my disappointment when I realized that the reason why there are no timestamps on the episode isn't because Love forgot (silly), but because the segment spans the entirety of the show (sad) :(",
            "Wtf? That\u2019s such an incredibly wrong decision\ud83d\ude2d",
            "A description is more than enough and I don\u2019t want to get jump scared by a sick or dead cat today. I watch for the comedy part of the comedy podcast, not 3.5 hours of animal abuse talk.",
            "Yeah, can we really not handle a sick cat? Like AB was saying he wouldn't show some cat diarrhea and the the sick cat and it kinda feels like babying. Yeah it's morbid but do these folks not see dead birds every now and then outside? Hell, sometimes there are sickly cats by the dumpster and I still make it through the day.",

            "right, getting downvoted like crazy \ud83d\ude2d we talk about way worse stuff more regularly, but god forbid someone hurts an animal (which is hypocritical since most of those people arent vegans either)",

            "This is why I feel like they are sometimes very out of touch. Like a normal person working Monday-Friday doesn\u2019t not wanna spend their Friday night watching a 4 hour segment on animal abuse. at least not my kind of fun unwinding night",
            "unfortunately yes",
            "It\u2019s because Bobby was supposed to be the guest for this ep and he called in \u201csick\u201d day of so they had nothing prepared.",

            "Bro, i just tuned into the live feed real quick, and they just PAST THE 3 HOUR MARK AND STILL DISCUSSING THIS. Imma go ahead and say it: worst episode of h3 ive ever seen along with the Hasan episodes where they kept talking about israel/palestine and were adding no new information. Wild that 30k still watching live.",

            "Exactly this. I can get into petty, dumb drama but the serious stuff just burns me out. There's been a lot of stressful stuff going on around me recently and I'd rather avoid things that are bringing me more stress like some of these topics.",
            "It\u2019s not a jump scare when they quite literally warn the audience before they show it\u2026. Did you also complain about it being a comedy podcast when Ethan held David Dobrik and Dom accountable??",
            "weird flex but ok\n\nand yes I\u2019ve seen dead things before, but I don\u2019t tune in to my favorite goofy podcast to get a dose of 4 hour long reality",

            "The podcast is not always about unwinding. I\u2019m so annoyed about the people who decide that their idea of what they \u201cwant to watch\u201d is what everyone should be putting their effort into making. Sometimes you need to hear about shitty things that happened. Sometimes people need to be held accountable, like damn why are so many people watching just to talk shit. Just stop watching it\u2019s literally so easy. It\u2019s just one button. I can show you if you would like?",
            "How is it possible they have this depressing topic the whole 4-hr episode when viewers were clearly getting upset lol. Didn't they try to check the vibe of viewers?? It's already 900+ comments in the megathread \ud83d\ude02",

            "They always just say \u201clay off the crew guys\u201d which I understand if people are making insults or otherwise rude comments. But just commenting how the actual content of the show is slipping, nothing to do with the individual members? Lunacy to time those people out imo",
            "ah. i joined 1.5 hours into that so missed it. just saw someones post about bobby being the new pewdiepie (meming about him not ever showing) so i didnt know what to think about that. thanks for letting me know!",

I probably would see names I never heard even at 20M+ followed channels. Still, it's big enough that if they get in drama, it'll be big in internet. Nobody called imalexx nobody in previous ep. Ofc it's harder to gather followers on youtube than tiktok but still, it's mere 2M followed channel.",

            "I respect that the podcast covers important issues, but my point was about timing and knowing your audience. Fridays are chill-out nights for many, so a 4-hour deep dive into animal abuse can be a lot to handle. It sounds like others were feeling the same way during the segment. It's understandable for listeners to express discomfort when a podcast airs content that feels heavy or intense. I'm a frequent watcher of H3, and it was disappointing to see them not hold the abuser accountable. But everyone can have their own opinion",
            "idk girl...i understand they're allowed to talk about whatever but it's just not my desire to be sad on a friday night you know. i fell in love with the show because of the goofs and gaffs",
