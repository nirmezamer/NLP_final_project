There's also the particular idiom involving someone's eyes 'glazing over', but I've never seen the 'over' left out of that usage of the word and, again, I don't see any indication that this post is about Godzilla getting bored and spacing out. Lastly there's 'glaze/glazing' in a culinary sense, a sugar-based sauce used to coat food items that dries on the surface in a way evocative of the pottery use.\n\nIt's that last one, specifically with doughnuts or similar baked good and plain sugar icing, that leads me to the most modern slang usage of 'glazing' that I'm aware of and the usage that would be my first guess for a post like this on the internet. In short, seminal fluid looks visually similar to icing and things/people can be 'glazed' in a euphemistic sense. This leads me to question whether this post is *actually* about Godzilla being slathered in semen, or if there's some even newer slang that I haven't caught up to.\n\nI also have the vague notion that there might be some metalworking use for the term too. . . but I'd have to look it up to know and am not going to count it as part of my understanding given that.",

Truthfully Mutos might be the most challenging, given the time they can go 1998/ 2016 on our buts, and flood the region with a mini-army, Ghidorah or thermo G would be needed for a large group like that.\n\nKong could be a challenge, since the humans would give him some bs knowing how he keeps getting gifted new weapons by others in recent movies.\n\n\n\nKing Ghidorah would definitely have to stay on our side, since mecha would be weak to those beams relatively, and the fliers would be zapped, and Goji might not be strong enough, since his 2014 and 2019 variants were definitely not strong enough, and GxK Goji might have better chances, but he's not in the above images.\n\nMecha Godzilla wouldn't be too bad to take down, since the design uses its tail quite a bit in GvK from what I remember and the knees would be a relatively open place for others to attack if it was distracted, not to mention ghidorah could just drop the guy.\n\nGodzilla as an enemy would be a bit tricky cause he has been improving through the movies, so he could be a threat if not taken care of quickly, and he could make use of whatever combination, since kong would be a fair bit nimbler than most kaiju.\n\n  \nWell anyway, I'll be going with Godzilla, Mecha Godzilla and King Ghidorah, and although it may seem like an obvious win to some, the opponents should not be underestimated, especially a breeding muto population and an equipped kong.",
