            "Toshokan No Daimajutsushi\nIt's the best read I had this year, and I don't say it lightly. It's a fantasy world following a kid who wants to be a librarian. I can't do it justice by describing it, so I will say that it's well written, the world building is great, it's nothing like your isekai trope. The more you read the more you discover the world, societies, the lore, the problems that will rise in the next chapters. It would do a great adaptation in anime",
            "I finished <Non Non Biyori>! It's a cute series. I think the Renge chapters and the Natsumi chapters were my favourite, Renge because she was such a goofy kid (and later on attempted to be an older sister figure, which shook things up a bit) and Natsumi because she was such a screw-up lmao. I didn't particularly love the series, i don't think it stands up above the other slice of life type stuff, but it was a good read-through.",
            "**My Wandering Warrior Eating Disorder** aka **<Meisou Senshi Nagata Kabi: Gourmet de Go!>**\n\n\nIn this part of the gripping autobiographical graphic novel saga by Nagata Kabi (*<My Lesbian Experience with Loneliness>*,*<My Alcoholic Escape from Reality>*, etc. etc.) it goes into more detail of, well, if the english title isn't a dead giveaway, her eating disorder issues that coincided with/stemmed from the rest of her psychological and depressive issues that she went on at length about in her previous books. This one is much much shorter than the other entries though. But still, if you've read and like me have been impressed by her works thus far this entry is here to read as well.\n\n\n**<Skeleton Double>**\n\n\nI liked this. I really did. Interesting base for the use of powers in this story. The Cypress lady was great. And once they characterized the MC he got interesting. But oddly, beyond a lot of those surface level thoughts on this one, I don't really have anything more succinct to say about it. Though the rushed final conflict with all the potential story elements crammed in there at the end on top of the overall feel at the end probably didn't help in that regard.\n\n\nIt didn't really do anything wrong in it's execution, and like I said I enjoyed it. I just find myself without much to say about it beyond, \"well that was cool\" a lot of the time.\n\n\n\n**<Daddy and Buddy>**\n\n\nWell this sucks Beavis, another decent series came to a sudden end. Not that I couldn't foresee this series being one of those cases from the get go but still.\n\n\n\nWell in any case. The mature emotional throughline of this series really gave this one it's chops.\n\n\n**<Dear Anemone>**\n\n\nAnd this one didn't last long now did it. Not that I was expecting this poor mans version of *<Jigokuraku>* to anyways. And it went out on a very cheesy note.\n\n\n\n\nWell, the artwork certainly did it's job though here can't deny that. Got some mild enjoyment out of reading it. But it will ultimately not be missed.\n\n\n\n**<Futari no Lion>** aka **The Two Lions**\n\n\nIt was short and there and I was bored with no better ideas for things to read so whatevs.\n\n\n**<Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai Comic Anthology>**\n\n\nDamn was I bored as fuck with no better ideas for something to fill an hour with enough to read this...",
            "Yakuza Reincarnated, it had a good premise but I am still checking if it does wonders. Hopefully it doesn't turn into a shitshow that is Re:Monster",
            "Caught up to <Bokura No Kiseki> literally one of my best reads of all time. Why is this manga is underrated? A large cast who is so, so wel written, an amazing plot with rich lore and amazing plot twists? It's an amazing series.",
            "Started <The Apothecary Diaries> and caught up with <Blue Lock>.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Apothecary is pretty fun, and I adore Maomao for her little cat appearances and the way she's just so unphased by Jinshi sometimes. Also, her inner gremlin coming out when medicine is involved, very cute. The mysteries are pretty intriguing, quite like how some (maybe all, I have bad memory) cases have little hints that relate to the answer Maomao comes up with. For example, >!when the woman woke up before the dude she poisoned, without much help, which did play into what Maomao came up with as a solution!< while she was visiting her home.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nQuite good overall, and the art is great. I'm only on Chapter 35.1 though, haven't caught up yet. I'm mostly curious if Maomao is gonna take any major losses by drawing a wrong conclusion during a case in the remaining chapters, I think it would be a good shake up.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Onto Blue Lock, I really enjoyed the U-20 game. Isagi's goal at the end actually made me yell. On the other hand, my eyebrows were raising reading just about everything Shidou said during the match.\u00a0\n\n\nThis whole arc was just plain awesome and chaotic: Rin going boogeyman mode, Shidou, the Itoshis, Ego actually showing a hint of happiness for once, Aiku, \"Make us win, you shitty four eyes\", Reo and Nagi actually working well together after a while, Nagi's fist pump, and Isagi's puzzle coming all together with the \"luck\" piece.\u00a0\n\n\nThe 2 follow up SoL chapters were a great break from all that, pretty cute and chill.\n\n\nThe current training/selection games(?) with the top players have been good so far. I do think they're a little worse than U-20 quality wise since it's been >!Isagi brainblast sweep moreso than usual, and Bastard beating Ubers and Manshine felt a little bleh IMO.!< I do appreciate how some underutilized dudes got some screentime though, namely Raichi and Hiori. Also Kurona, kind of, but so far he seems like a bit of a pass bot.\n\n\nOn the flip side, Kaiser has also been jobbing as a \"rival\" compared to Rin tbh. He was annoyingly good at first, but now that everyone is getting awesome moments and >!Isagi has been out smarting him most of the time,!< he kinda sucks. Sure he'll >!probably score the next goal, but I don't like him enough to get hyped.!<\n\n\nTo finish on a more postive note though, I've been loving the character interactions this whole arc. Reo and Nagi >!getting back together for an awesome stars aligned move!<, Charles and Shidou >!instantly becoming besties!<, Reo and Isagi just generally being friendly compared to \"What the fuck is this guy talking about\" two arcs ago, and the top players continuously making fun of Noa only for him to \"\ud83d\uddff\". Also, I laughed extremely hard at >!Rin and Kaiser breaking down after Isagi scored in the PXG match.!<",
            "I recently caught up on a few manga I stopped reading a while ago, or even years ago in tha case of <Kaiju No. 8> and <Spy x Family>.\n\nI got lucky with my timing. Kaiju No. 8's latest chapter is the climax of a long arc. I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much if I was reading the chapters as they came out, but I think the pacing is good if you read it in one go.\n\nSpy x Family doesn't have any arcs that long but still had some very tense moments. I am glad I didn't have to wait two weeks after every chapter to see how >!school bus hijacking!< would end.\n\nI also caught up with <Oshi no ko> and <The classroom of a black cat and a witch>\n\nOshi no ko is entering the last arc and I am curious to see how the antagonist is going to react to what Aqua has been doing.\n\nClassroom also just finished a major arc with >!Spica finally getting her first win against Aria!<. Followed by some good chapters deepening Spica's relationship with Claude, and a chapter in which a major character >!licks their own but.!< That last one made my laugh out loud several times and made me remember why I loved this manga in the first place. Definitely planning to keep up with this one again going forward.",

            "Hey! I need a favor. What\u2019s the name of the manga with the little orange dragon that rides on a roomba? There\u2019s a little purple dragon as well. They both serve a guy in a modern day hunters thing with gates and all that. Also, I was hoping to find this manga where the guy gets reincarnated as a side character, in a modern day hunters/guild/gate type thing. He also has a skill that makes him stronger the more famous he is. He was known for being ungrateful and bad, but now is a good guy. If anyone can help I appreciate it!",

            "The newest issue of Rising of the Shield Hero appeared, and the artwork is great. There's a lot of scenes with \"beautiful singing girl\", and \"crazy with panic\" giant chicken.\n\nThere was a large update of the Ascendance of a Bookworm manga translation, and I'm working my way through it. Time to read, praise to the gods!",
            "I'm reading Kitchen Princess for the first time! I'm having fun, it's very soapy in a way that I always get a kick out of, and the art is absolutely beautiful. I absolutely love early 00s shojo art - it's probably my favorite manga art style, especially with the splash pages. Kitchen Princess in particular has some of the prettiest splash pages I've ever seen.\n\nPlus, I'm teaching myself how to cook more, so reading about people cooking is just kinda fun.",

            "I finished <Rough> this week. It definitely got more fast paced and dramatic towards the end, which made me realize how the first half or so had parts that were a bit disjointed (or maybe there's connections/foreshadowing that I didn't notice right away). But overall, easy and enjoyable read.\n\nI also finished <Koroshiya 1> that I had to use A LOT OF WILLPOWER not to just binge in one night or else I would not function at work the next day. Quite gory, very intense characters, intense scenes. There were parts that I felt a bit uncomfortable >! Ichi's past... I was shaking my head with his perception of the bullying and sexual harassment!< but I couldn't stop reading either way.  The plot imo tied in quite nicely.\n\nI also finished <Adam to Eve> because I was browsing other works of the creator of Koroshiya 1. The idea of having each of the men represent a sense is great, I wish it were developed more? But at the same time, I'm fine with what it gave. Also pretty gory and intense scenes.\n\nFor new reads, I am in c7 of <Korisenman>, I will probably have more to say about it next week.\n\nI am also in c88 of <Futari wa Daitai Konna Kanji>. I am enjoying it a ton, it is a well-done SoL GL so far. It is very wholesome and heart-warming, but it isn't afraid to delve into the more >!sexual topics of the various characters!<. Excited to read the rest of it this week (\u273f\u25e1\u203f\u25e1)",
            "Started reading <Beat & Motion> this week and have since caught up. \n\nTL;DR: Really interesting so far, the latest chapter was especially good. \n\nWhen I say I caught up, I mean I binged all released chapters in about an hour. Very good read that I started after watching the Gigguk recommendation. The story is about a (college?) student working out his own dreams and actually doing something to chase it. The pacing was done really well, but the last chapter is a bit concerning as far as serialization goes.>!Things were a bit rushed in the latest chapter; it felt sudden as if some plot points sudden and a bit forced into the chapter, and it kinda seems like the series is gonna get axed soon. !<I really hope the adaptation will bring more attention to the manga so it does better in Japan.",
            "#New this week!\n\n**<God Bless the Mistaken> volume 1**\n\nI heard about this quite recently, and learned even more recently that it was getting TL'd in English. Ordered volumes 1 and 2, and just finished reading volume 1. Given that I'm not Nio Nakatani's biggest fan AND that she's more known for writing Yuri rather than Sci-fi SoL/Iyashikei, I kept my expectations low. But boy was I impressed. It's definitely an ac!d trip at times, but it really was interesting. **9/10**\n\n\n#Ongoing!\n\n**<Bocchi the Rock!> volume 2**\n\nVolume 2 was pretty solid. Better than volume 1, actually. But for some reasons, it took me *hours* to read this, despite the low page count. Yeah, 4-komas tend to give me trouble for some reasons. **8.5/10**\n\n**<I can't beleive I slept with you!> volume 2**\n\nVolume 2 was great, bugh *highly* predictable, when you consider that the series only has 3 volumes. Despite it's predictability, it was nonetheless a better volume than 1, which was pretty solid itself. **9/10**",
            "Been enjoying my read of <Call of the Night>. I went in pretty much blind knowing almost nothing about the series. It\u2019s a strange one for sure but I appreciate weird titles like this still coming out. I expected <Seraph of the End> in the real world basically but got something totally different.\n\nCall of the Night Spoilers >! I\u2019m enjoying the discovery of Nazuna\u2019s past and the development of the relationship between Ko and Nazuna. I am excited to see what the conclusion of the story ends up being: who is Nazuna really? What\u2019s the deal with these vampires? Why does Nazuna like Ko? Who is Nazuna\u2019s mother really? !<\n\nOn the other hand, after this I\u2019ll already queued up my next manga, which will likely be me FINALLY reading something I planned on reading over a decade ago <Suzuka>. I\u2019ll try to go in mostly blind to that one as well.",
            "I was recommended <Bakuman> a while ago, so finally got stuck into it.\n\nIt's interesting, in how it gives you a slightly more realistic view into how the sausage is made, while still offering some silly scenarios and situations. The character of Hiramaru is basically my favourite (A disgruntled officeworker turned mangaka), doing everything he can to avoid work, with his editor using all kinds of tricks to get him to turn in storyboards on time and meet deadlines.\n\nBut I do struggle to get through the arc of Nakai's character. Nakai is basically a 35-year old fat slob working as an assistant at first, then getting his own publication. He's also got an extremely disgusting view towards women, thinking that he can get with the most beautiful girls many years younger than him. Eventually he even starts to threaten a girl with rape.\n\nThat's fine (I mean, not the rape of course), but how some of his fellow artists keep sticking up for him is just... incredible. Especially one of the protagonists, Mashiro, keeps wanting him to come back. I'm not sure where this is going - is it depicting Mashiro's naivit\u00e9, is it setting up Nakai for some kind of redemption later on or the opposite, his final mistake?\n\nI'm letting it rest for a few days, to gather up the willpower to read more about this horrible piece of shit, but I do hope the story eventually moves away from him.",

            "Got around to finishing [Baki part 5](https://myanimelist.net/manga.php?id=115749). Kinda underwhelming, probably the weakest part. For one thing, after Musashi and a god damn cave man, Sumo is just... tame. Even with all that over the top Baki narrations and comparisons, the Sumo fighters were nowhere near as interesting as any of the previous fighters from earlier parts. For another, it also felt rather directionless. Even the ending has this 'huh, that's it?' sort of feel to it.",
            "I picked up <Sometimes Even Reality Is a Lie>, which I remember skipping over so many times in the past few years. Judged it solely on a basis on the crossdressing tag, which I often avoid, but yeah, I have to say it's the best manga I've read in a while. From now on a really solid goto when recommending romance manga to people. It reminds me a lot of Ookami Shounen wa Kyou mo Uso o Kasaneru, which I loved as well.",

It's not that it's bad but things just don't fit. Realistic art mixed with ecchi and the classic big eyes and this time on women only, just gets freaky. \n\nSo far I haven't seen anything like showing the side of the police gaining awareness of the MC's group or something, that lacked. But mostly, the series should be a shounen. The demands and limitations of shounen would do very well for this series. The logics behind some fights happening are just so shounen... \n\nThe elements of this series just don't fit together.",

Loads of psychedelic imagery, overstuffed with detail pages, inventive panel layouts, repetitions with slight variations, and a hero on a quest to expand his mind. G was also full of what I believe to be Koike\u2019s specialty - graphic match cuts and use of repetitive, almost trance-inducing, visual refrains.",

The FMC deals with this concern by trying to get the MMC to hook up with another girl so she won't feel monogamous urges. He's against it because he only loves the FMC (even if his boner springs up at a gentle breeze) but she gets her half sister gets involved.  \nIn the original run, he only hooks up the FMC and there's the fall out of that with some brewing NTR shite.\n\nThis was the will of someone else, Mangaka kicks back demands to be allowed to draw a threesome. So he retcons the arc and re-leases the chapters where now MMC fucks FMC and her sister. The main issue is that post-threesome the whole \"I only want to sex with the FMC\" plot by the MMC doesn't exactly work as well. And then Mangaka introduced childhood friends for both FMC and MMC that they have mutually better chemistry with.... so who the hell knows what's up.\n\nto tl;dr:   \n\"Did you get a threesome with a cute girl and her half sister?\"  \n\"Yes\"  \n\"What did it cost?\"  \n\"Everything related to the plot and character development up to this point\""

            "One of the most \"\"\"normal\"\"\" characters is a yandere teacher who popped the MC's cherry, stalks him despite a restraining order, kidnaps the love rival, I think tried to blackmail MC's mother into selling him to her? 10/10 the best yandere I've ever seen\n\nIf this sounds like a trashy romcom then remember, this series takes itself seriously as a psychological drama",
            "Her name is Chako. \n\nShe looks completely different in the first few chapters btw.",
            "w8 this ie chako ? not the teacher?",
            "God RSG is so peak",
            "Yes though it feels like it's probably in it's endgame",
            "5 chapters before ending, apparently",
            "Yeah. I think it's in the final arc though...\n\nUnless they decide more suffering is needed.",
            "It's on chapter 180 lol.\n\nYou're gonna have to wait a bit to binge. Looks like it's in its final arc but from past experiences with this manga it could end in 10 chapters or a hundred more.",
            "It's supposed to be this super dark story, but it's so packed with outrageous plot twists delivered for more drama that it circles around to being funny. It's like a soap opera, everyone is someone else's secret something, has a dark crime in the past, has an unrequited forbidden passion, and a dozen other things at once.",
            "Its misery porn. Thats it. Thats all there is to it. The abyss in the name is the abyss of misery, which is the mc(boy) himself. The general arc goes like this, character meets misery man aka mc, falls in his misery, life is destroyed, done. No happy ends for anyone. Ever. At start, it seems like the story will eventually get somewhere but it just doesn\u2019t.\n\nSo like, at some point, you just gotta laugh at the ridiculousness.\n\nAnd as the other guy said, best stay away from this, it got me weirdly anxious while reading it, i kinda just dropped and never looked back. 100% would not recommend to a depressed person",
            "True. Its one of the best depiction of yandere like a real yandere unlike a romcom yandere",
            ">One of the most \"\"\"normal\"\"\" characters is a yandere teacher\n\nEasily my favorite character in that story mainly because every time she goes yandere mode you know some funny stuff is going to happen and is one of the few people who constantly push the plot forward.\n\n\n\n>this series takes itself seriously as a psychological drama\n\nThat's the absolute best part of that manga, the fact that not only it lacks anything resembling self awareness but it also takes itself so seriously that I'm physically incapable of reciprocating that seriousness and instead enjoy the ride as a really funny involuntary comedy.",
            "Thin Chako yeah.",
            ">but it's so packed with outrageous plot twists\n\nMc's mother's backstory where >!her boyfriend sees the middle aged man come out of her house!< was the final straw for me even though we could see it coming from a mile away. I was very calm at that moment because I knew I was done with this manga and won't look at it again.",
            "for real, friend recommend it for the fucked up ness but a lot of the scenes were so absurd it was hilarious. that said i dont even remember where i stopped reading.\n\nshould look it up.",
            "it has \"peak\" around certain chapter but afterward it just dragging out just for unintentionally comedy",
            "\"wE caNT eScAPe tHiS cUrSEd tOwN\"",
            "When I was reading it, that's what I was thinking too. Why do every chapter needs to end with a twist? After a while, it just became too ridiculous for me to take it seriously.",
            "Reason why i stopped reading it. It was good until the gay admition part but it went downhill after",
            "damn I always mistook her with the teacher",
            "It's not even that that specific thing would be unbelievable, dark as it was. It's that it happens in the same story in which >!the teenage MC had sex with *two* different adult women just in the first five chapters, Yandere Pedo Teacher is a main plot driver, his best friend actually murdered his dad and may be gay for him, his other best friend tried to seduce this old novelist dude who was actually his mother's sweetheart when she was a teen prostitute,!< and a bunch of other incredibly contrived connections and over the top dramatic occurrences that make the whole thing feel like some kind of misery harem.",
            "Generally, when a story wants to characterized a location the story would take the time to make you familiarize with the place, it would have something unique, a particular architecture, some traditions, anything to make that place stand out. That's why it cracks me up how much the double down on the town being evil and shit but then the location itself is so generic that it doesn't even has interesting locations, even the suicide river a lot of characters wax poetic about looks generic",
            "Plus the entire time it feels like >!his mother wants to fuck him at any given moment.!<\n\nYeah, I'm amazed at myself for reading 94 chapters, 2021 me was a different person.",
            "WTF\n\nSo happy i felt pretty early in the story that it would be trash and stopped reading it!",
            "Also the >!the best friend murdering the step dad under order of the mom is because he has gender dysphoria with him idolizing the mom's beauty and popularity (because she's been the town bycicle since highschool), and later attempt to rape and force mc's childhood friend (that also has a crush on him) to marry him because if he can't get mc's dick, noone can. Then the three of them goes to Tokyo together anyway!<",
            "To be fair, isn't it all of this because of some type of curse in the city? But then this curse is never elaborated too.",
            "Yeah, felt like the mother was hinted to want to fuck him but then it turned out to be a bait and switch either because they decided it was a step too far or maybe they just forgot it. It's like the plot has ADHD, all that matters is that each chapter ends on a SHOCKING CLIFFHANGER, and who cares if it makes no sense. Plot threads get abandoned or forgotten all the time. Reminds me of another (now mercifully axed) manga that while being not quite as edgy had the same issue, \"The Ichinose Family's Deadly Sins\". After a while you didn't even know WTF was going on any more.",
            "The part where >!he's just tried to rape her and then they just all merrily chat away about running to Tokyo with him *still on top of her* is so fucking surreal. Top comedy.!<",
            "Is this a literal thing in-universe? It really mostly feels like a fan theory.\n\nEven then, Junji Ito wrote \"Uzumaki\" about a town cursed by eldritch forces and turns out you can actually execute on that concept much better than this shit.",
            "It's a curse, a real one, as in real life, not fantasy magic curse curse. Back in the emo days and a lot of music still, they sing about how they're gonna leave this town and never come back but never manage to take a step outside. The curse is generational poverty and abuse that just repeats over and over with each generation.",
            "Then >!when they make it to Tokyo the girl just fades into the darkness and disappears like a a character with superpowers.!< Impossible not to laugh.",
            "> Is this a literal thing in-universe? It really mostly feels like a fan theory.\n\nIt is \"a thing\" but not literal, but something the characters talk about sometimes. Nothing confirmed though.",
            "Poverty begets poverty, and trauma is spread through the generations."
