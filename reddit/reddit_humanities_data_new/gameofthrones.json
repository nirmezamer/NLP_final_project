            "I just need to know whether the regular post-episode discussion threads are going to be back. Discord is too chaotic and overwhelming. It's thousands of people commenting at once. With (as far as I know) no way to organize the relevant discussions by threads and topics like here on good ole reddit. \n\nThe first thing I do when I get to an episode thread is sort by top comments. I hate that there is no way to do that on Discord. This has always been my favorite world of Ice and Fire subreddit, but I'll definitely be moving on to others that still have actual post-episode discussions if they aren't being held here/moved to Discord. \n\nI'm not trying to be childish or petulant, but I'd be legitimately disappointed if there's no more stickied night-of post-episode threads (preferably with post-episode surveys attached, but that's another thread for another day).",

            "Where were the guards? That was my concern.",
            "one thing is I'm WAY more into Season 2. great opener. i had high hopes and they weren't dashed.",
            "I loved the opener, was thrown off by Jace's sudden hairstyle change. Didn't he have short/styled hair at the end of last season when he flew off to the Wall and the Eyrie?",
            "That was such a strong opening. I loved the pacing. Rhaenyra's sadness hit me hard. All hail the Queen.",
            "Everything looks bigger and better. I actually really enjoyed the episode, aside from some of Jace's lines at the start, delivery was a little off. B&C being different I thought would annoy me, but I actually don't mind how they showed it here, it was brutal enough not seeing anything.\n\n\nIMO, solid opener, and this is just the nail in the coffin for any sort of peace. Bring on ALL the battles.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso, Mysaria fixed her accent. Sick.\u00a0",
            "This is pretty dead. Why split up the discussions?",
            "Sir Criston Cole the new Master of Tounges! \ud83d\ude1d\nAlso the Official Royalty Boy Toy! \ud83e\udd23",
            "All I care about is that dude who kicked the dog gets his face smashed in",
            "ngl I was pretty excited for this season given Luke's fate in the season 1 finale, and it certainly didn't let that excitement go into vain. the way episode opened to starks theme was very nostalgic to hear + cregan seemed very similar to ned. Alicent was into her orgasms for almost the whole episode and lol the irony of she having pleasures while rhaenyra was suffering just made me go insane.\n\nsolid beginning for a season which is yet to blow my mind!",
            "Can somebody confirm. Didn\u2019t they invent the \u201cscorpion\u201c weapon much later in the original Game of Thrones? Showing up in House of Dragon?",
            "I honestly thought... it was a tiny bit boring. At least as compared with GoT was back at its best.",
            "That rat catcher is going to meet a sticky end. Killing a child and kicking a dog within a few minutes.",
            "killing a child is kind of meh but killing a child infront of the mother and \"making her choose\" was almost heartbreaking to me, i think the emotional scarring of the mother was 1000x worse than the death of the child, i couldnt imagine a woman having her life taken away from her like that where she is manipulated by the culprits as being seen as the one responsible",
            "Does anyone know who the greatest warrior is in this era? Is there an Arthur Dayne of this era? Is Daemon the guy?",
            "Damm Timezones, I Barely watch this and its already day after discussion.",
            "Why didn\u2019t they show Aemonds reaction or mind frame after killing luke??",
            "Would the war have escalated as quickly or at all as it's going to if Aemond was the one killed instead of the child?",
            "Why did he insist on brining the dog only to kick it away at the end? Is this part of the book?",
            "The fact that this was posted 8 hours ago and only has 14 upvotes is telling I feel.",
            "Boring episode",
            "Truly disappointing. Could\u2019ve been so much better had the show gotten better writers.",
            "i like the show but i wish it had at least one character that i could root for. Everyone in the show is scheming on some level.\n\n  \nthe only guy i can kind of root for is the kingsguard guy who has had sex with everyone (Ser Cole). but the fact that he was having sex again is the reason the baby was killed. \n\ni guess the older lady (*Rhaenys Targaryen*) and her husband are honorable characters.  but they ultimately just go along with Team Black as supporters anyway, so it's not like their honor counts for anything",
            "Mistake found.  When Arryk's twin speaks to Daemon about their betrayal he says that they were 8 and 10 (about half way through the episode) when they swore allegiance to the King's Guard.  But they are twins.... so...",
            "Banging the queen.",
            "Yeah at first I thought to myself \"This isn't very realistic, they'd have guards all over the place of the castle...\". Then I thought, unless the Lord Commander dismissed them. So I think this will weigh very heavy on Alicent that her desires could have got the boy killed.",
            "Was the first episode of the show not also a great opener? It felt like I\u2019d just watched half a season of GoT.",
            "I wish I would get paid for this, but apparently the HBO social media team was already set. Anyways, this was the BEST opener EVAH!\n\nIf you want the honest opinion of a real person: This was probably the most boring lifeless episode I ever watched. In fact I didn't even watch it to the end, because around minute 30 I started skipping. I don't know what they are doing, but this is the anti-version of GoT.",
            "Kind of feels like I'm watching Downtown Abbey or Brigerton.... so slow",
            "Be honest, that hair change gave you some earlier  season John Snow vibes..",
            "it's a long way from Dragonstone, maybe he stopped at the Crossroads for a haircut before meeting his boyfriend",
            "He wore a wig in Season 1 because he cut his hair too short, it\u2019s his natural hair in Season 2",
            "Well, /r/HouseOfTheDragon has its own subreddit, with over 1.3 million subscribers.  More HOTD discussion happens there, than on the subreddit for the previous show that broadcast its last episode over five years ago. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
            "I think it's always been this way",
            "I haven't checked out the threads for this episode, but for last season I believe it was because the immediate post-show thread tended to be filled with \"quote porn\" and people just reciting or fawning over their favorite parts whereas the day-after thread was supposed to be for more thoughtful discussion.",
            "This was too easy so I laughed too hard. But still a tip of the hat",
            "In GoT Qyburn had to basically relearn how to make Scorpions because it had been hundreds of years since anyone had seen a dragon. Anyone who had previously known how to make them was dead.",
            "It was invented a long time ago, Dorne used them massively during the war with Aegon during First Dornish war and even managed to kill his sister's dragon along with her.",
            "Depend if they follow his fate from book or not.",
            "Criston Cole is the best fighter of this era from what I can remember. Daemon and Aemond are good too but they are dragon riders first. Arryck and Erryk, the twins, and Harold Westerling are semi-notable",
            "I think the look immediately after the incident said everything they needed to say",
            "Dogs are used for ratcatching.  It's part of the cover...to a point...",
            "The \"no book spoilers\" post in the more appropriate subreddit has 5100 replies and 1900 upvotes but that's probably not telling. ;)",
            "Boring characters, boring discussions, boring story. If this wasn't wearing the GoT-tag I would switch off instead of skipping through. Fun fact: You can get the from the sewers straight to the throne room and the guards don't care, in fact nobody seems to care anymore, just like me.",
            "You could say that about any show. Considering this is already at like an 8 or 9, there's not really much to complain about.",
            "So of all the characters Cole is the only guy you could kind of route for?! \ud83d\ude02 Wild statement.",
            "Well that\u2019s kind of the point, everyone sucks in war. You can emphasize with aspects of both sides, but does that mean all the people and sacrifice is worth it?",
            "8 and 10 means 8+10 meaning they were 18 years old when they swore allegiance. You'll notice throughout GOT and HOTD that's how it's phrased any time they're stating an age above one digit.",
            "Banging the queen is an unofficial part of the job, but it's a duty nonetheless.",
            "Was the Lord Commander the person Daemon gave gold to? I got confused that he was the same person with the rat traps.",
            "But his hair grew twice as long. That sounds like an impressive way to do haircuts, just make the hair longer",
            "It was FIVE years ago??????? Already??????\n\nI'm old wtf",
            "OK, that makes sense. Just wish they would\u2019ve mentioned in GOT that they found some schematic or diagram of how they were made years ago instead of reinventing and calling it the same thing.",
            "Ty!",
            "Dam cats and dogs?",
            "This is nowhere near a 8 or 9.",
            " who are you rooting for?\n\nneither of the two main women are really demonstrating any moral compass\n\nin GOT the starks repeatedly showed they were moral and honorable people. so i could root for them\n\nin this show it\u2019s more like everyone is either cersei or marge tyrell at best\n\nnone of them show us any real idea of how they treat the people of westeros either\n\nso we\u2019re just watching a power struggle between elites.",
            "Lord Commander is the guy who was in bed with Alicent. They hide their relationship which makes sense why he'd dismiss his soldiers to \"Guard the Royal chamber himself\".",
            "he wasn't the lord commander but a normal gatekeeper which had little to no allegiance to greens \n\nfuck hightowers!",
            "They did. I just can't remember the episode.",
            "Yep.  Cats are more passive about it, dogs more active.  \n\nDepends on if you have 100 rats or 2 I think.",
            "I could hear arguments for a 10 but I wasn't that thrilled, personally.",
            "really? what did you compare it to? fucking lotr?",
            "Thank you - I guess I need to re-watch the first episode again.",
            "Maybe something fast paced like F&F or some Marvel crap. These people...",
            "it's not explicitly stated that Crincel Cole understaffed the royal chambers but it's implied, along with the fact that Larys replaced a large amount of the staff with people he chose himself\n\nif Alicent don't trust her new employees, she'd likely tell Crincel Cole who would in turn dismiss them for the night under the guise of guarding the queen himself",
            "The guard Daemon paid was one of the guys with the rat traps though."
