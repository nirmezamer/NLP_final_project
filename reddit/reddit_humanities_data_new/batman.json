Examples of such topics are:\n\n- Asking for thoughts on an adaptation of a character for a movie or show that has been out for more than one year\n- Asking people's thoughts on a recent movie or other adaptation\n- Arguing that \"Batman has always killed\" \n- \"Who would win\" topics, which might be better suited to r/whowouldwin\n- Asking people's favorite episodes of a show\n- Asking people's favorite or least favorite villains, sidekicks, or other types of characters\n- Character comparison posts\n- \"Erase one' posts\n\nThe above list is not complete, and contains just a few common examples. The list will be expanded over time, but ultimately topics moved to weekly discussion threads are subject to moderator discretion.\n\n**For a list of recommendations of comics, films, animated films, television and games, please see [our extensive wiki entry](/r/batman/wiki/recommendations/)**\n\nPlease remember the rules, especially the rule to be civil and treat others with respect.

            "I believe it wasn't mentioned until _Under the Red Hood._ You're correct, this never happened in the _Death in the Family_ storyline itself.\n\nSo, I suppose there had to be a considerable interval of time between Joker killing Jason and Batman putting him in traction. I don't even know where in the timeline that would fit. Didn't Joker disappear for a bit after _DitF?_ I think the very next \"Joker\" story after it had an imposter Joker, and I don't remember when the real one turned up next.",

            "I think the explanation for the \"Joker as Iran's ambassador\" is:\n\n1. Jim Starlin read _Watchmen,_ and thought \"it's really sophisticated how this superhero story deals with geopolitics.\"\n\n2. Jim Starlin then thought, \"this superhero story I'm writing will also be made more mature and sophisticated if I inject some geopolitics into it.\n\n3. Unfortunately, unlike Alan Moore, Jim Starlin did not understand geopolitical issues beyond maybe things he saw in _Lethal Weapon 2._\n\n4. So, Jim Starlin gave us a story in which The Joker becomes Iran's ambassador to get diplomatic immunity, while also dressed in Arab garb even though Iranians are mostly not Arab (he probably got the country confused with Saudi Arabia).",
