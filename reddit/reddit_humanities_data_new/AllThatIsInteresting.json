Iirc the sole survivor only lived cause he was saperated from the group as a fire watch. But he couldn\u2019t get back to his guys in time.

They didnt have to follow the same standards as other type 1 crews, and just didnt have the experience. They made a terrible choice, and i think the movie was trying to rationalize what an odd decision they made. From the investigation it sounded like they just didnt want to wait where they were, and decided to take a shortcut to another safe zone across a chimney canyon. Usually when a fire starts blowing up like this you just chill, and wait for your turn to make your move. A lot of the time its the next morning. Theres nothing you are going to do as a handcrew. The idea that they were attempting a frontal attack in a chimney canyon was the part that annoyed me most about that movie.",
