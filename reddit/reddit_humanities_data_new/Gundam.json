            "SEED Freedom is the pinnacle of Gundam animation.\n\nIt's easy to see why so many people rewatched it in theaters over and over. There is so much intricate detail littered throughout scene after scene after scene, that you always see something new.\n\nThey didn't *need* to show Blue Cosmos grunts wrecking Murasame's way in the background, they didn't need to show Agnes using the spike on the bottom of the beam halberd to mercilessly finish off a Dagger, they didn't need to show DRAGOON's wrecking Zaku's from Strike Freedom's cockpit for less than half a second.\n\nIt's brilliant, because it incentivizes multiple rewatches, which paid off big time in theaters, and we the audience benefit from the insane amount of attention to detail that sets a new bar for Gundam animation quality.",
            "I finally realized what I was comparing this movie to mentally when I was thinking of it having a \"90's action movie vibe\". It's basically the same kind of movie as Starship Troopers or Independence Day: they may not have the deepest or best written plots, but damn are they so fun to watch in the most bombastic way that you can rewatch them multiple times while quotable quotes and moments get stuck in your head.",
            "https://preview.redd.it/iysvhzncu66d1.jpeg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e53a9c7d6e9abc5b9877bc0931277f8683efbad8\n\nOh yeah, I\u2019m thinking CINEMA",
            "Utterly fucking stupid dumb shit fan wankery. Peak Seed/10. Would freedom again. Loved it.",
            "The first 1/3 was stupidly soap operatic that even I, a CE apologist, had to cringe. But gad damn I was in tears when Kira and Lacus were affirming their love to each other even when separated, like shit, they were so nonchalantly perfect in Destiny, it's nice to see their walls break down. Especially Kira.\n\nStory beat was simple, but man, this is truly a love letter to CE fans with all the callbacks. The last 1/3 of the movie was a blast, I wish I didn't partially spoil myself months ago.",
            "Fun fact: Seed Freedom now grosses over 12 million HKD in Hong Kong alone, 1/20 the amount it made in Japan. Hong Kong has 1/17 of Japan\u2019s population so Seed is almost as popular in HK as in Japan.",
            "i hope it comes to streaming and/or DVD/digital in the US soon",
            "I actually burst out laughing when they paused the whole movie for Lunamaria to line up a shot and everyone clapped after she hit the missile. Fukuda has definitely studied the fan feedback to Destiny.",
            "When I was a kid, I used to imagine all sorts of superhero/gundam scenarios with the Archangel.  I\u2019m sad that it\u2019s gone, it was a badass ship.",
            "I wished they spent more time in Kira and Lacus' time with ZAFT and the PLANTs. At the very least I wanted to see Kira interact with Yzak.",
            "Just finished watching and the movie is still fresh in my mind. I haven't engaged with SEED since Destiny ended, and I'm definitely not a fan of the particular spin off.\n\nThis movie was so, so, so, so stupid. And, boy was it so goddamn fun to watch. I remember being ambivalent towards Athrun after his ups-and-downs in SEED and Destiny, but he is easily, the biggest chad in the movie. >!His fight with Shura, short as it was, was perfect. I did not see the Cagalli gambit coming.!<",
            "Watched the movie two days ago and had time to re-watch certain scenes and reflect on the movie as a whole. The movie is not perfect, but it is immensely fun with a lot of heart and dedication put into it and it shows.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* pacing issues (heavy scenes and consequences needed to breath)\n* Agnes (we did not need a Quess 2.0, at least she didn't kill anyone we cared about)\n\n**Personal Taste:**\n\n* not sure what to think of the sudden-ish shift in tone / focus in the second half (with the all you need is love bits)\n* Lacus's fan service was bit jarring. Nothing wrong with fan service, but it seems inconsistent with her character portrayal up till now. Her flight suit and jiggle physics was a tad bit ridiculous .\n* antagonists are comically villainous (still wondering if the movie would have benefitted from a more 'grounded' type of villain, think Durandal)\n* a longer runtime either as a 3 hour movie or a series of OVAs might have been beneficial / fixed the above issues but I digress\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* shows that our characters actions from Seed Destiny have consequences\n* fights (every fight was different and had its own flavour)\n* mecha designs \n* character characterization / arc in the protagonist camp (Kira, Shinn, and Lacus's characterizations here redeem them from their GSD portrayals. Does the inclusion / existence of this movie make GSD a better series? Still undecided on that.)\n* music & sound design (I had the biggest grin on my face when 'Freedom' started playing)\n* Easter eggs (Shiho there again. Will we ever see her fight?)\n* everyone got a moment to shine. (Dearka and Yzak in the Duel Blitz and Lightning Buster with Meteor was chef's kiss)\n\n  \nI would say the film has a satisfying ending, though it does leave enough stuff unresolved in the grand scheme of things for possible sequel projects. Even if we don't get any of those though, I would say this is a good wrap up of the Cosmic Era.",
            "Watching this movie reignited my love for Gundam.  I'm so happy I got to see Kira and Lacus again.  Not gonna lie, the first half of the movie surrounding Lacus/Orphee/Kira felt like a hentai plot lol.  It was so frustrating to see Lacus hanging out with Orphee while Kira was just suffering in the background.  I'm glad Lacus was able to resist the brainwashing though due to her love for Kira.  The ending was kinda horny, but it was so satisfying to see Kira and Lacus finally kiss each other.  And I did not expect that random shot of Lacus's ass in a space suit lol.  \n\nIt was nice to get some clarity about Athrun and Cagalli, since I was confused about their relationship at the end of Destiny.  Athrun made the Z'Gok look so menacing.  I think that Stella showing up when Shinn got mentally attacked by the Black Knights was really out of place though.  Agnes didn't need to exist in this movie lol.  The 3DCG was actually really good, and I think there was a good mix between 2D and 3D.  And I didn't think it was possible, but they made the Strike Freedom look even better than before.  Proud Defender + Strike Freedom got me geeking out!",
            "Story is simple but it made like Kira again. He feels really human again, and all it took was NTR and Athurn punching him. Shinn was the soul of the party, he was just having the time of his life and I am glad for him. He was always doing something funny and his Destiny fight was the best in the movie. MVP. Agnes is Quess-lite, but I kind of like how Lunamaria actually beat her up and then picked her up. I want to imagine a world where Agnes moves onto Lunamaria and joins her with Shinn.\n\nThe movie was oddly really funny, so I like it for that. Athurn just trolling the BK while Cagalli controlled his mech was the funniest thing ever.",
            "The movie is probably peak CE soap opera but damn, Freedom's (well, MSF in this case) multi lock-on attack+METEOR always hits like crack even 20 years later.",
            "I enjoyed seed when I was younger. So seeing everyone again was nice. The movie is very soap opera. Love drama and the massive genocide moments were glossed over which was ridiculous. \n\nUltimately, like all Gundam series it's about stopping the bad guy at the ends. I liked the black knights. They were scummy and felt dangerous unlike rey and shin at the end of destiny. The suits were all great.\n\nLove is the main story at the end and it literally conquers all. Shinn wins thanks to Luna being in his brain still. Athrun outwits his opponent thanks to sexy cagali. And lacus comes in a full body suit with a deus ex machina to save kira. It's cheesy as hell but I like it",
            "this was my introduction to the franchise and i couldn't be happier to find a way into gundam",
            "I kind of wonder how would the attack have fared if Kira didn't get so aggressive to Agnes the night before. If anything, I'm surprised he wasn't reminded by Flay when she tried kissing him.",
            "I am happy Athrun and Cagalli got the bare minimum. A gag and a six second scene take it or leave it. Fukuda doing his wife proud.",
            "The movie needed 3 hours.. In what we got it felt like we had very little time for all the new and returning characters (which in total is like 20 characters), little time for showcasing the new mechs and technology, and not enough time for the story. The first half of the movie was well paced, but by the final half it felt like a frantic rush to get things out the way so things can wrap up.\n\nI liked the movie but damn it there just wasn't enough time and it suffered for it very anticlimactically.",
            "This would have been better as a full series. More time for the villains to get properly set up along with developing the characters emotionally. As it stands the whole drama between Lacus and Kira gets resolved within the hour. There just isn't enough to for the audience to settle in to what's happening before the plot point has already moved on.\n\nI do like how the movie tried to move away from God Yamato by humanizing him again. But jeez, they didn't have to go all the way back to Bitch Yamato from the first series either. It makes me curious about the reception of this movie in Japan as IIRC the God Yamato persona is really popular there.\n\nAs an Athrun-stan this movie was cathartic. Our boy once again stands tall, brings minimal drama, and is instrumental in resolving problems. Not sure why he split up from the rest of the crew (again the movie vs series thing) but it makes sense since if he was already more things never would have gotten that bad.",
            "Over the last month I binged all of seed. Did not particularly enjoy... much of that and I won't say this somehow made all of that time spent worth it but the movie was rather good imo and really feels like a finally satisfying end point.",
            "Took long enough, but I'm finally getting to see it on Sunday! At this point I've annoyingly already been spoilered on a lot of Plot Point, but several of those were either out of context or just described in Text, so I'll see how everything comes together ultinately.",
            "Just watched it last week, I love it.\u00a0 But I think the pacing is too fast, keep changing locations every minute, it would have helped if they splited the film into 2 parts.\u00a0 Also, is it me or is the battle animation too fast?\u00a0 Sometimes I had difficulty following who is fighting who.\u00a0 \u00a0I didn't have the problem watching Seed and seed destiny.\u00a0 I need to rewatch it later, I am sure I have missed tons of details the first time.\u00a0 I just need to finish reading the novel before rewatching.\u00a0",
            "Just finished watching it, best way to describe the movie is big and stupid, in the best way possible. Literally every SEED scene was referenced somehow, even the most obscure references to the show were there. Loved it, gonna watch it again one day.",
            "KagebunSHINN no jutsu",
            "Best thing about the movie for me really is the mecha choreography. GS/GSD always had good mecha choreography (so much so that it's been reused to hell even by 20's standards.). To name a few:\n\n* SF classic fodder beam spam: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xkX0HQ9MRU&t=50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xkX0HQ9MRU&t=50) (sidenote: loved how SF struggled fighting in melee that we don't really see with IJ and Destiny - shows how SF is not leagues ahead of the other 2 suits)\n* Destiny 1v4:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_wes1BFR84M&t=45s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wes1BFR84M&t=45s)\n* Z'Gok debut: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyqw55QbJnE&t=8s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyqw55QbJnE&t=8s)\n* Lastly, Athrun vs Shura: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UatOl31ztc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UatOl31ztc)\n\nSo yeah, all 3 main guys really had their moment in this movie. Not sure how the next CE series tops this.",
            "I had thoughts initially for the first 80% of it... then they all flew out of my mind after Lacus got into the Proud Defender.\n\nDamn son, since frigging when did she have DAT ASS and such a rack? She was always completely conservatively dressed, always.\n\nKira is a lucky son of a gun I tell you...",
            "Oh didn't see this 3.0 thread. Though to avoid copy/pasting what I wrote, I just want to add that it's absolutely hilarious how they went full Graviton Beam Emitter. Now in possession of the single most powerful weapon in that universe, they can now enact their vision of peace through diplomacy in the most sensible way possible. \n\n*One vision, one purpose! Peace through power!*  \n*-*Kane\n\nAlso nice throwback to the whole performance of a mobile suit does not determine the outcome of a battle shtick.  \nKira: Proceeds to get wrecked cause the latest Freedom 3.0 somehow sucks? The hell is this gacha powercreep bs!? Also, MINDFREAK!  \nAlso Kira: Proceeds to get wrecked cause my Freedom 2.0 sucks and somehow ran outta power. Wait wut?  \nStill also Kira: I'm done being NTR'd in my own goddamn movie by yet another goddamn la Flaga clone of all people! LACUS IS MAI WAIFU!   \nLacus: I'm going to \"dock\" with you Kira ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)  \nKira: Wrecks face in his totally not uber spec Freedom 2.0 suit with the POWER OF LOVE\u2122 and anime.\n\n\\*Proceeds to travel to a deserted beach all the way from outer space cause man after so many years they DTF.\\*  \n10/10 ending.",
            "About MSF, I could understand the Disruptor beam breaking molecules bit what exactly stopping Nuclear Fission did?\n\n\nDoes that mean when that beam is fire every nuclear fission on that area is stopped?",
            "The story was all over the place but whatever, we got a fucking ship ram and that honestly is the best part. Lacus going fucking god mode and just leap out of the gundam mid battle was like ??? \n\nI would still rate it really high, probably like 9/10 but im sure nostalgia is heavily weighted in.",
            "just watched Seed Freedom here in Stockholm (loved the crowd and their reactions). i cant say im truly impressed with storyline but it was good. For the 20th anniversary tho, we could have gotten more than just Lacus and Kira's unconditonal and cringe love story in this movie. Politically it could have been more than just the continuation of Durrandal's destiny plan spanning 19 years.  In the end, we didnt get a resolution even tho they did explained their intentions and beliefs. \n\nthe fact we only didnt get to see more of cagalli and athrun SUCKS. we need more of this two and how things will unfold for orb. i just need of this universe  to continue and have a proper ending.",
            "Watching Kira get cucked for like an hour was pretty wild.\u00a0 Solid action scenes, my favorites usually involved Athrun and also Shinn turning his brain off when fighting the boy band in the Destiny.",
            "Unironically, the lipstick made this movie so much worse for me. What were they thinking? It had to be Fukuda's fetish. It's set a year later and no one else looks different so don't give me \"it was to age them up\", it was super distracting and messed with the character designs.",
            "And I just saw another little detail that pops up briefly that I've missed until now. [You can see the Sword and Force Silhouettes flying around Blast Impulse.](https://i.imgur.com/8nqYLhZ.jpg)\n\nThere's always something new to spot!",
            "I haven't watched the movie yet. just wondering if they used the \"invoke\" or \"meteor\" song in the movie?",
            "this movie give me weirdly Shinn x ghost Stella, Luna, Agnes and Hilda vibe that i couldn't stop thinking about or is it just me???\n\nANYWAY, it seems Shinn has Anti-Newtype ability where Newtype couldn't sense or read his mind, and especially it a 4 Newtype vs 1 Half awaken Newtype, one of them able to Mind trick Kira mind easily while there 4 mind combine attack Shinn Mind and Ghost Stella prevent it or Shinn Mind is that Strong or the darkness in him too strong",
            "Last night I watched Seed Freedom, my thoughts:\n\n1. Kira's mental regression. Where's his calm (kinda stoic) personality? He basically become his Seed era but more powerful (MS wise and miitary career wise, as he now a Commander, but kinda backward from White Jacket from the end of GSD?)\n2. What happened to \"Ultimate Coordinator\"? Basically Orphee and Lacus \"The Accords\" are the ultimate coordinator. Even they got Innovators ability!\n3. SF II with battery? What happened to the reactor? Did ORB forgot how to make it? Also their spec (GSD's big 3) is pretty low\n4. Flay archetype? So Fukuda got a type huh? Even got same VA with her.\n5. Also anyone can use METEOR? Cool\n6. Cal Re.A is cooler than SFII (without Proud Defender), change the color scheme to Char's red and that will be good, or give the backpack to Kira (Oh please, include this suit on GB4 base game)\n7. Fukuda also edging us, will be a BD where basically Orphee r\\*pe Lacus?\n\nI gave this 9/10 because the nostalgia with GS/GSD",
            "The one thing you shouldn't doubt in Seed is Lacus' love for Kira so I was saddened that Kira himself questions that or her.. there are issues here and there but overall, I really enjoyed the movie! \n\nWould be nice to have some OVAs to show what happened 6months prior, some character history, and what happens next or an epilogue. Just really want for more Seed content. \nMy inner child is really healing with this movie and craving for more",
            "Ayy, I finally got to watch it! To be honest, I felt like the Movie was less of a \"shitpost\" than people seem to treat it, but maybe I just didn't see it that way.\n\nThat said, I did get some good laughs out of the more commonly brought up scenes, like Shinn getting decked by Athrun and Kira during their argument, so it's not to say I didn't have a fun time. Infact now I understand why so many People say Shinn stole the Show for them, my boi really DID get done incredibly well, and I love him for it more than ever before!",
            "Question about Seed Freedom\n\n>!It might be a bit late for a discussion like this but it's only now where I found a free version of the show. Anyways am I the only one who didn't understand the purpose of the movie in terms of the overall story?!<\n\n >!I know it's mainly made for the fans thus all the fanservice and to sell model kits but I feel like the show just came back to where it started. Like yeah sure the final battle was cool and all but peace still wasn't attained. One nation was nuked, another was struck by a massive death ray and I'm pretty sure there will be a lot of upset people especially on the Natural's side since it was all because of coordinators. Not to mention blue cosmos was still running around doing who knows what.!<",
            "So my only real question is when we're getting the film in the US, as I have SEED and Destiny on DVD already (trying to find Blu-Rays that don't cost an arm and a leg has been a bitch, sadly.)  and I'd love to get Freedom on Blu-Ray when/if it comes out. At the very least, I'd want crunchyroll to pick it up since they already have SEED and Destiny on the platform. Anyone know when we're getting it over here? I know it had a limited theatrical engagement, but sadly, it wasn't anywhere near me so I couldn't watch it when it hit theaters.",
            "A little question which was in a corner of my mind (and asking it here before I forget again) : A reason why Hilda switched from her GYAN Strom to Luna's GELGOOG Menace for the final battle ? I don't recall her losing (or even getting it damaged) her GYAN Strom in the first battle against the Foundation or did I miss this detail ?",
            "Spoiler free: Gore but some explosion scenes are not gore enough.",
            "https://preview.redd.it/afq6ocd25r6d1.jpeg?width=937&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ef18576cb27eed07f904e659cd908b10f55de23\n\nIori Sei has come full circle. Even the Destiny has the RG System now.",
            "Their heads are uncanny at times why is it so big?",
            "I finally finished watching the movie. For what it is (fanservice movie), it's a solid 7/10. As a normal movie, it was closer to a 6/10. \n\nThere were things I did enjoy. I think there were some characters that I personally liked how they handled. \n\n- I really liked Lunamaria more in this movie than I ever did in Destiny. She seems more put together as an individual. Yes she did need Shinn to get energy for her Impulse, but I can let that slide given the powerscaling and all that. Overall, i think she was handled much better. \n\n- Athrun was great as always. He was badass and always seems to be the adult in the room. I kinda wish they did elaborate more on what he was up to this whole time before he showed up. Was he infiltrating the Foundation  cuz something was shady about them? I feel like if this were a series, they could have elaborated more on this.\n\n- Yzak, while didn't have much screen time, continues to have a greater overall character development that continues in this movie.\n\n- I loved how i finally have a Gundam Seed animation fight without having to see the same fighting animations 4-5 times lol. Graphics were pretty nice and i liked the upgrade to the modern formats. The lips were kinda weird at first, but i did eventually get use to it.\n\nI do think that there were some major issues with the movie that I didn't particularly enjoy. \n\n- The whole Accords thing was very weird and kinda out of left field for the Gundam series. Even for a futuristic anime, it felt too sci-fi and unrealistic for that universe. Felt like something out of Code Geass rather than Gundam Seed. \n\n- I have mix feeling about Shinn. While Shinn was definitely better in this than in most of Destiny (low bar), I wish Shinn had more moments with Kira. While Athrun will always be Kira's boy, I wish there were more moments where Kira realize that he can count on Shinn and they had more personal interactions with each other. Something a full series would have been able to do.\n\n- Kira was okay. I think the quickness of the timeskip and the need to get the plot going really hindered the movie's ability to show Kira's downspiral into doing this by himself. At the end of Gundam See Destiny, Kira asks Shinn for help where he relied on everyone and his friends to help them achieve peace. To start off just instantly doubting that at the start of movie seemed rushed. I do like that they made it so he isn't \"perfect like a coordinator\" and does have \"feelings like a natural\". I just think his descent was too abrupt.\n\n- Lacus was probably the biggest disappointment of all the characters in this movie. It kinda felt like Lacus was used more as a plot device in this movie. She didn't really have much to do and I wish they didn't make her a damsel in distress. She showed great restraint and willpower to fight against the whole Accord destiny thing, but I don't think it had the impact that the writers wanted because of how little they can do in 2 hours. \n\n- The whole concept of love in the movie was very evident, but sometimes felt strange and unnatural. The love that Kira and Lacus have for each other is obvious and fine. Orphee's love for Lacus was kinda strange and felt forced and explained through the whole Accords thing. Ingrid's love for Orphee would have been something nice to have explored if this were a series rather than a movie. Agnus' issue with love felt unnecessary and the movie could have done without it even though I understand they're using Agnus as a different perspective on love. I just think that they emphasis the whole concept of love enough to where they don't need Agnus' weird subplot.\n\n- The ending fight was mixed for me. It was cool seeing a new Freedom and new \"Archangel\", but it was really fucking insane what the fuck happened at the end. It's like the dial turned from normal to batshit insane. Freedom somehow got super OP. The whole countering Accords power was also very weird with Athrun thinking of Cagalli nude and Stella protecting Shinn cause the Black Knights to see Shinn's Destiny using Kage Bunshin no Jutsu. It was just kinda insane (a little too insane) at the end.\n\ntldr; For what the movie made for the Gundam Seed fans, i think it's a fine watch especially if it's for free. You'll love the references and the new Gundams. The fights were pretty solid. I think they should have either made this a longer movie or made this into a mini series because i think there are a lot of plot issues that could have been easily solved with just more time put into the story. Watch this for the references and fights and don't watch this for the plot or story.",
            "Albert Heinlein\u00a0having the same VA as Lelouch made me very happy",

            " My reaction to this movie felt weird and cringe. The dialogue was so weird that the cartoonish antagonist managed to convince Lacus and Kira with his aggressive speak. \n\nInvites to the army, mind controls Kira, reveal themselves immediately as bad guys with 0 depth, suddenly nukes are throwing left and right, why having politics when you could just have nuke them from the beginning.\n\nThis movie feels so long and short at the same time.\n\nFun ride but needs polished. Action scenes seem even more crazier",
            "The plot and the character caused major brain damage. \n\nBut the action scenes cured my cancer. \n\nContinue to bully Shin/Seed. Will watch at least the fight scenes once more.",
            "The first battle between ZAFT and Omni really bring back nostalgia and remind me why I like the setting. The moment Kira sliced the weapons of the ZAFT soldiers who, bear in mind, were attacked and almost massacred (hundreds of their civilians were already dead by the time Kira arrived) is the moment I turned the movie off.   \n  \nIt reminds me how self-righteous Kira was written to be and how both PLANT and Earth were meant to be the same two evils like Zeon and Earth in the original timeline, but the writers forgot that PLANT was more often than not, were defending themselves. The whole \"Why don't you understand! You can't take revenge or else it will continue the cycle of hate!\" that he shouted at the ZAFT soldiers was ridiculous and proved how disconnected he was from the war.",

            "It's quite pretty, and is definetly a detailed movie but no way imo is it a better animated movie than Char's counterattack, and the 90's OVAs also clear it, especially 0083. I know it's personal preferance and stuff but the CG mobile suits just doesn't look particularly great, and the effects work in something like CCA is much better.",

            "Agreed with the SF bit. If anything, look at how its depicted in the Gundam Extreme Vs game series. Go try to take it into melee and see how you fare... you'll get absolutely destroyed. It's always been depicted as a pure ranged suit and that's how you have to play it... At least in that game series, your entire gameplan is centered around proper Dragoon management and landing the full burst.\n\nSeed Destiny really made the SF look a lot more powerful than it really was, since Kira was up against the Legend which was also a ranged suit, but piloted by an inferior pilot to him. The Legend has better funnels/dragoons, but Rey's inability to match Kira in spatial awareness made Kira look godmoded by default... and meanwhile Athrun was fighting Shinn, two melee suits vs each other, and two ranged suits vs each other... Kira and Athrun being the superior pilots to Shinn and Rey... yeah, skews the perception bigtime.\n\nI'm actually glad that the Black Knights were able to expose the SF's weaknesses so thoroughly. Sure, they were cheating also with the Femto armor (as well as the missile support from the 3 ships) but still. \n\nI do wonder tho if you remove the Femto armor that no-sells 90% of the SF's offense and remove the missile ship support, and make it 1v1 instead of 1v2 at the time... Kira probably would not have lost.\n\nThe problem they've created is that by stacking the deck in such a way and then having Kira overpower it all with the Mighty SF has established that suit as the absolute complete unrivalled suit in that universe. Literally nothing comes close, at all, even without the Disruptor in play it basically wins by default... effectively ends the story since with the Mighty SF, Orb is now truly the unrivalled power in the world and can enforce its ideals through absolute power.\n\nStory's well and truly over coz of this.",
            "As usual, no matter what... they always leave it at 'we need 5 more fucking minutes'. The movie needed 5 more minutes after the beach scene to just show the true aftermath, like a minute each of all the factions first... Earth, PLANT, and then Orb realizing the war is truly over... 1 minute of Orb declaring absolute hegemony and 'you all play ball OR FUCKING ELSE'... maybe a scene like Cagalli and Lacus holding a massive public declaration and handshake, with the Mighty SF in the background to reinforce the fact that they can indeed say whatever they just said because they have the biggest fucking gun in the world.\n\nFinally 1 minute of all powers signing some peace accord, etc, and then short flashes of all the entire main cast and how their lives progressed, maybe with a final shot of Kira and Lacus' kids playing with Athrun and Cagalli's kids at the beach house from the first Seed while their parents set up a BBQ or something.\n\nAn ending like that would be perfect... The way it is is lacking that last 5 mins of true full closure IMO.\n\nKira getting wrecked in Freedom and Strike Freedom really was actually explained quite well... that is, if you know about the suit and don't just assume it's the most OP in the Seed universe, coz it isn't. Freedom/Strike Freedom always was a ranged suit, with the Justice/Infinite Justice being the opposite counterpart. It's not almighty.\n\nWhy did Kira get wrecked? Simple... The Black Knights basically were playing with pseudo-God Mode ie their Femto armor on their suits. It's a weaker ver of the Akatsuki's Yata-no-Kagami that 100% reflects and no-sells beams. Femto isn't on that level, but it renders beams mostly useless nonetheless. Beam blades/sabers still work but shots/projectiles are worthless. Freedom/SF is a ranged suit... nuff said. The Rising Freedom had NO chance since they also went in with a full ambush while Kira had ZERO knowledge about his opponents or their suit abilities.\n\nIn the 2nd major battle with the Strike Freedom... it was 1v2, Kira vs Shura and Orphee who are the 2 strongest of the Black Knights. Not only are they Accords ie absolute peak Coordinators that are above Kira's so-called 'Ultimate Coordinator' level (Kira is a failed Accord)... 1v2, Femto armor... Shura's suit being pure melee oriented, and Orphee's having far superior DRAGOONs (3 shot per vs SF's single shot)... Orphee having superior Coordinator abilities to control said DRAGOONs ... Kira had no chance even in the Strike Freedom... and I didn't even mention the 3 missile ships that Orphee had full control over that were constantly barraging the SF to overload its Phase Armor and drain its power faster than the Hyper Deuterion engine can replenish.\n\ntl;dr = The deck was overwhelmingly stacked to a unwinnable level against Kira in both battles... and it's purpose basically was to highlight the Freedom and Strike Freedom's weaknesses... Since the end battles in Seed Destiny made the SF look like it was completely unbeatable... No, it isn't... Rey just fucking sucked as a pilot and was not even a Coordinator vs Kira, while piloting a suit that 120% depended on a Coordinator's spatial awareness to utilize to its max AND it being a ranged suit like the SF... While Shinn took on Athrun, melee suit vs melee suit. \n\nThe entire thing was a reverse deck stack to Destiny... simply to undo the image of the 'unbeatable' Strike Freedom... just so they can introduce the TRUE unbeatable Mighty Strike Freedom. Now the Mighty SF... ok, yeah, that suit truly is unbeatable, game was well and truly over the moment Lacus 'docked' with Kira. \n\nNothing to do with 'DE POWEAR OB LUV' or anything. Mighty SF truly has no counter. It has perfect defense and an unbeatable offense.",

Nuclear fission is caused by atoms colliding... If the atoms are simply gone, how can they collide? There's nothing left.\n\nThat's basically how/why it stops nuclear fission... if the beam shoots a nuclear missile, the missile will not explode, it will simply be cut in two where the beam touched and fall inert in two pieces (or more, if the beam touches the remainder as it falls).\n\nThe other thing that makes it unrivalled is that it has no travel time whatsoever. It's a very literal instantaneous shot which simply 'appears'... meaning its faster than light.\n\nYou can see in the first firing that literally within an instant, the entire Messiah asteroid gets cut in half and the 3 missile ships with it.

Why? Coz of that bullshit Disruptor.\n\nIf you look up official materials, it basically is a beam that not only 'dissolves atoms' so basically anything at the molecular level is simply taken apart, doesn't care what it is... if it EXISTS, it has molecules/atoms... it will get taken apart... It not only does that, but it STOPS NUCLEAR FISSION.\n\nAdditionally, it's a beam that fires 'instantaneously'. There is literal NO travel time... what does this mean? It's faster than fucking light. The only time you have to know it's coming is the telltale 'darkening' around the Mighty SF's head, then boom, you're hit and done. I mean, FFS, it CUT THE ENTIRE MESSIAH ASTEROID IN TWO in a very literal INSTANT.\n\nWhat in the world can fight that? Absolutely nothing. In a universe where nuclear weaponry is still the main 'top' power, nothing can stand against this.\n\nBy dint of absolute overwhelming power, Orb can now force all sides into peace. Conflict on a large scale is basically over, done. The rest is just a matter of time.\n\nIf there's going to be any continuation, it will probably just be wrap up episodes where all the characters get closure and we probably see Kira/Lacus and Athrun/Cagalli with their kids or what not... but in terms of global conflict, things are pretty much over.",

It's also why he'll never actually be a 'good' fighter coz anyone with actual combat training like Athrun can beat him hand to hand. That spar with the Black Knights also shows this.\n\nIf you're going to ask 'then why did Shinn win in the Destiny'? Its because the Destiny was designed purely for him and fits his style... the suit's performance is enough for him to stand on equal ground with the boyband 4 and his lack of thought is a natural counter against their mind reading/screwing tricks.\n\nStella is a total bonus, they didn't expect that at all on top of his empty headedness.",

There was no conclusion to the overall war between Naturals vs Coordinators... like you said, Blue Cosmos was still running amuck, etc.\n\nSo this movie is the closure.\n\nAfter this, it's quite obvious the story, at least in terms of the 'war' between Coordinators vs Naturals, etc, is very very conclusively over and done with.

No one will ever say the SF is bad unless they truly don't know how to play ExVs. \n\nIIRC, from ExVs1 onwards it has always consistently and constantly been high A tier, only ever dropping as far as mid A tier... but its never ever fallen out of A tier. \n\nWhat I meant was that SF's melee isn't 'weak' but if you compare it to say, the Destiny... yeah, it's weak. You'd be a fool to try and out-melee a melee suit, esp with current ExVs2 OverBoost.. or even if we go back one game to XBoost, same thing.\n\nSF always was a midrange specialist suit ever since they standardized its play from the beginning of 'Extreme Vs' onwards and I totally agree with the design that basically paints it as a suit that relies on its guns and ability to dodge, which is exactly how Kira pilots it for the most part vs anything strong.",
            "Thing is tho, Jesus Yamato was only OP in Destiny because the deck wasn't stacked against him. He not only had a suit with higher spec than the Legend and Destiny, his final opponent was a 'literally fucking who?' failed clone of Rau Le Cruset.\n\nIf he had had to fight Shinn in the Destiny instead, it would have been a much MUCH better fight as it would have at least been a suit that could exploit the SF's weaknesses. But no, they put a literal nobody with inferior abilities in a ranged suit that requires Jesus tier abilities to 100% utilize against him... I would have been far more surprised if Kira DIDN'T godmode as hard as he did in Destiny. If you have the deck that far in your favor, you better be looking like the 9002nd coming of Jesus.\n\nWith regards to the whole Accord bit, outside of just a new name... there's no real actual showing of how its superior to the so-called failed Accord outside of being able to somewhat read/influence the minds of other Coordinators... and within the same show, it was shown that they could get around that pretty easily.\n\nShinn being able to 1v4 is more down to the boyband 4 BK's literally being trash tier scrubs that can only rely on their Accord gifts. Typical example of overly talented ppl without any actual skill. Only Shura and Orphee have any legitimate ability. The rest talk a good game and can't walk it when the chips were down... which was pretty sad since their designs weren't bad at all but not enough screentime in a single movie to play em up.\n\nThe whole Kira vs Shura/Orphee fight was at least understandable as to why Kira lost badly. It was 1v2 vs the only two Accords in the show that had any legit ability to speak of, and they not only no-sold 90% of SF's offense, they had additional outside artillery support while Kira was alone. If they couldn't take him down with that much of a reverse deck stack, they should hit the self-destruct button right there and spare the world their incompetence.\n\nOverall, I don't disagree with the tech powercreep bit coz its true. In a world where the 'top' primary form of public energy provision is still nuclear power, something which was supposed to function as an 'anchor' to our current reality and make the existence of battery powered mobile suits believable... yeah, in 4 years we now have an actual invincible Gundam coz very literally NANOMACHINES SON! NANOMACHINES! and a beam that cuts literally everything and travels faster than light.\n\nBut at least it's over. I totally expect them to make an Extended edition or 3-5 episode OAV at some point but I doubt the ending will change. It's very conclusively over.",

            "SF is not the strongest in CE at the point of Destiny though.   \nDestiny is the strongest in CE in the point of Destiny.   \nIt's just that the pilot isn't up there in comparison to Kira. \n\nAs with the tech power creep. I always think it makes sense in the world of C.E.   \nCoordinators are literally superhuman. Their ability to be able to push tech and innovate should also be better on paper due to better genetics make up and also very likely smarter than your average \"natural\". They even talked about this in the first SEED. Coordinators being in a MS is so strong that the earth alliance couldn't fight back. \n\nUnlike UC where the \"MS\" is more of the reason why they cannot fight back. In CE it's the pilots ability plus the MS.   \nNow when you are looking at the super form of said superhuman (Ultimate Coordinator) or the top amongst those super humans (Athrun). The only thing they can make the fights interesting is how much tech can they abuse and can abuse them in return. \n\nIt is no longer what can you do, how can you do because everyone is \"strong\".   \nIt is more \"how much can tech bring out your full potiential\"   \nWhich is also something shown in U.C when Amuro was too fast for the RX78. \n\nAnd I feel like a lot of people missed the point of the movie about Kira's abilities.   \nKira is not weak in the movie. Kira is not \"weaker\" than GSD kira. Kira is being the main focus of the villains. Kinda like Angel Down in Destiny. \n\nAs for the power thing, it was already mentioned in seed with andrew, he knew how many bacue missiles can take down the PS armor of the strike gundam and talked about how PS requires a lot of energy and can actually be used against PS armored units. \n\nThe Destiny didn't get hit by countless missiles and kept having to block physical attacks from 2 ace pilots that can sync their brainwaves and read your every single move.   \nLook at how shura's heat blade drain the Rising Freedom. \n\nTheir whole weaponary is created to overload the PS armor, which in turn will overload the engine. When you are constantly having the engine to output at maximum output, the engine will overload. It is also a thing that happened in SEED manga. The meteor unit literally drained the power of the Freedom or Justice (Don't remember which) which have nuclear power.",
            "Good catch. The phase shift was \"overloaded\" for dramatic effect, but I suppose they did enough to make the situation plausible. I mean the inherent weakness of PS was the battery drain and NJC's nullified that, but eh not a hill I want to die on so sure it got overloaded by conventional means even though they didn't use the newfangled weapon they have specifically to overload it this time around.",

He may be called the 'Ultimate Coordinator' by Rau Le Creuset but whether or not he is actually ultimate is hella debatable.\n\nHis areas of expertise definitely are his extremely high intelligence and data processing abilities as well as his spatial awareness and ability to multitask... but he loses in spatial awareness (as well as psyche) to the Accords and Lacus... he couldn't even see the 3 hidden missile ships w/o Lacus helping him with her consciousness link.\n\nThis basically proves he is definitely not 'ultimate', far from it. When it comes to intelligence and mental things he's in the top 1% , maybe top 0.1% of the Coordinator species but the Accords and Lacus are higher than him.\n\nNo need to talk vs Naturals... not even a comparison to begin with.",

MCSa wouldn't even combo with itself.\n\nEither way, you get my point... The ExVs series is the most 'fair and balanced' depiction of Freedom and Strike Freedom. It's very strong, but has clear weaknesses and is definitely not invincible like they made it look in GSD.\n\nI said it in another post that due to the overwhelming number of fans the suit has... they simply cannot make it weak, especially in video games. Gundam ExVs is one exception only coz it's been so heavily restricted to Japan. If we were to take an internationally released game where SF appears, it's almost guaranteed to be top tier... like take SD Gundam Battle Alliance for example... it's the toppest of top suit simply coz there'd probably be a lot of negative feedback and screaming if it wasn't.\n\nIt has a lot of haters, but the fans far overwhelm the number of haters... and these fans are also the ones that buy other things like gunpla. Bamco simply cannot piss this group off and hurt their profits.\n\nWhat they did in this movie was about the only way they could 'fairly' weaken the suit or 'lower its image' as invincible without pissing ppl off... and at the same time introduce the NEW cash cow that they're definitely guaranteed to milk for the next decade.",

There's plenty of 'background' movement to depict in OAV's... But continuing the overall war would be a bad move.",

They conveniently forget that the deck was so horrendously in his favor that it would be stupid if he DIDN'T look like 2nd coming of Jesus.\n\nThis actually created a problem as well as a benefit from Bandai IMO. It made the SF suit extremely popular which is both good and bad.\n\nIt has a lot of haters, but it has FAR FAR FAR more fans than haters... WAY too many fans, and that includes their expectations. Look at games like say, SD Gundam Battle Alliance... SF is the top tier suit there. It HAD to be... if Bamco had made the SF weak, can you imagine the hate/rage from its fans?... They cannot bear that sort of actual anger, and their Gunpla sales are also dependent on these sorts of fans. IMO, it is the most fairly balanced and well depicted in the Gundam Extreme Vs series. It is properly depicted as a mid-ranged attacker that is best played when primarily using its guns and DRAGOONs, which is lore accurate. But if they want to eventually move on from the Seed franchise or try and increase sales of some other unit, they need to bring the SF down a bit without pissing people off.\n\nSo in this movie, they deliberately wanted to undo that Jesus Yamato image and they succeeded. They did it in a way that can be clearly logically explained and used it as a 'springboard' to launch the Mighty SF... which from now will be the undisputed fanboy suit as well as Gunpla/merchandise king for the next few years..",

Kira is more like his SEED self if you consider that the decision he made at the end of Destiny (choosing to fight on instead of accepting the Destiny plan) is now haunting him in a similar way to how he was haunted by his need to fight to protect his friends.\n\nAnd even if you don't like the Kira and Lacus plotline, the action scenes and seeing characters like Shinn, Athrun, and co shine should more than make up for it.",

He never EVER wanted to be a soldier, ever. From the beginning life threw him a shitty curveball, and he was forced to hold that ball the entire damn way just because he 'had the ability' and with great power yadda yadda bla bla etc. At no point was he ever given a true choice to get off the bus... If he had the choice, he would have... In fact, he basically DID in early GSD, until the new war came to his doorstop and he was once again forced to pick up the shitball.\n\nBut I totally agree in that the policy of not killing your enemy, but hurting them only just enough to stop a fight is far far far more difficult than simply ending the fight w/o caring about their welfare.\n\nWhere was it stated that Accords have different powers?",

Even when looking at logs of what content was cut from the early ENGLISH releases, all that content is 1, restored in any future republishing & 2, not listed amongst any edits to remove blood/corpses/religious iconography, etc.\n\nI grew up watching anime imported from Japan & while I don\u2019t have that old VHS, I can\u2019t recall the scene ever being blood. It\u2019s cool, it\u2019s awesome, it\u2019s iconic, in 1999 American cartoons were dog shit compared to imported anime. Even when the English language versions came I couldn\u2019t even watch dubbed copies & was horrified the first time I bought a \u201ctoonami endless waltz edition (DVD!! Ooohh)\u201d and was confused at the edits over my recollection. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t an edit I remember like say the entire scene about stimulants being used to push the pilots back out of the mountain to fight the Feds because they couldn\u2019t sleep and everyone was getting \u2018dope\u2019 sick and malnourished being pumped full of drugs to go out and fight was cut from the original English version.\n\nEDIT: Like Norris Packard looking gaunt with such prominent cheek bones wasn\u2019t just his physique, it was literally all the Zeigs being malnourished and starving and knowing they had to escape their position. It\u2019s was a doomed last stand and even if the feds just blockaded the mountain the Zeon would have starved in that tomb of a base. So when the English version cut that whole drug scene and all drug references it was weird because it was kind of an important story beat showing more horrors of war. They had to sortie amped up on performance enhancers and stimulants. Sure some of the nude photos in cockpits being altered I get, but not some of those dialogues.",
