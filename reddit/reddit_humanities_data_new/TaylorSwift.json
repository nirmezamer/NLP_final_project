Come Back\u2026Be Here had its fourth performance on the Eras Tour and its fifth performance ever. Maroon had its seventh performance on the Eras Tour and also its seventh performance ever, having made its live debut in East Rutherford last year.\n\nMaroon is now tied with You're On Your Own, Kid for the most-played surprise song on the Eras Tour. (Unweighted. Weighting for mashups, You're On Your Own, Kid still has the lead.)\n\nDeath By A Thousand Cuts was previously combined with Babe during the Singapore leg of the Eras Tour. Come Back\u2026Be Here was combined with Daylight during the Melbourne leg of the Eras Tour and with The Way I Loved You and The Other Side Of The Door during the Lisbon leg of the Eras Tour. Maroon was previously combined with Forever & Always during the Sydney leg of the Eras Tour and with Cornelia Street during the Liverpool leg of the Eras Tour.

            "Nah smart thing would be to smother it with a sheet pan since it was contained in the circular candle holder thing, and then they wouldn\u2019t have breathed in the fire extinguisher chemicals.\n\nBut overall they handled it fine.",
            "Putting water on a grease fire to use simple terms, makes it explode and launch burning grease everywhere that might be on fire",
            "Google says a wet towel is fine for a candle wax fire if you can smother it and remove the oxygen using the wet towel. Obviously not a grease fire.",
            "And watch a video or read up on how to use it! I was taught how to use one at some point and that information (buried somewhere deep in my brain because I don't ever remember actually learning it) came in handy when I had to stop the fire shooting out of my grill and hitting the side of my house.",
            "Nope wet towel would have been fine just laid on top of the candle.",
            "Smart thing would have been to take a bowl and put it over the fire. People underestimate how messy fire extinguishers are. For Taylor it\u2019s no big deal because she has cleaners, but for you or me it would be a nightmare.\n\nAlso a wet towel is perfectly fine for a candle wax fire.",

            "Or salt. For a fire this size salt would work fine.",
            "Flour is also a good alternative.",
            "Yes, but under pressure, a lot of people don\u2019t think of these things. Their first thoughts go to water or a fire extinguisher, if they have one. Most people don\u2019t really think of these little tricks, even somewhat calm-under-pressure people like Taylor and Gracie",

There\u2019s a video of exactly that happening to Gracie from years ago which is probably why she\u2019s so adamant that they don\u2019t use water.",
            "Like another person said, candle fires aren\u2019t grease fires but throwing water onto it can displace the wet wax and cause the fire to get bigger. I mainly mentioned grease fires as that\u2019s what the person I responded to mentioned\n\nI still think it\u2019s very important that everyone knows specifically not to use water for grease fires because it will cause the flames to pretty much engulf the room within seconds. That\u2019s what happened to my neighbors, their fire spread throughout the interior of their home. By the time they ran out their front door it was already very large with lots of smoke. There\u2019s youtube videos you can watch to see how grease fires react to water, it\u2019s not very pretty",
            "Fun fact - most fire extinguishers for class B and C fires are going to have mostly sodium bicarbonate in them. Baking soda.",
            "I recommend fire spray vs. an extinguisher if the latter is tricky to use. And unlike the latter, it can be reused. Helped my now-husband, who wouldn\u2019t have had anything in his kitchen had I not bought it as a gift for him.",
            "It's one of the reasons they are dangerous unattended. If something goes wrong the smoke alarms won't go off until the carpet/curtains/table is on fire creating black smoke",
            "Lmao yeaa",
            "Some people panic, especially when they've never been in that situation before. This type of this isn't exactly covered in schools, so without some training you just don't know how you'll react in this situation beforehand.",
            "Wet towel/even a dry towel is fine. Liquid candle wax is similar to a grease fire just not as intense. If you used water on the wax, it would just disperse the liquid wax everywhere but it would stay lit. A grease fire would explode with flames if water was used",
            "I've personally put out candle fires and deep fryer fires (clueless roommates) with a **moist towel**. You want as much moisture in the fabric without it dripping, soak it and give it a quick wring it out.\n\nSmall fire extinguishers can be dangerous by spreading the burning fluid, especially when people use them too close",
