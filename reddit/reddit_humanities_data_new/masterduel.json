            "I have a bit of a personal rant...\n\nI have been playing with my friends since day 1 and have been the focus of negative comments and bullying on my deck choices. Let's take into account that 2 of us haven't played yu gi oh in years while one other friend has been up to date with the series.\n\nI will divide it by deck choices:\n\n1- Drytrons: I picked this deck since the secret packs had some galactic bears or something and I wanted to try those out. As I looked up for suitable decks with what I had, drytrons seemed like a popular choice so I went with it. I had no idea they were so broken, it was an honest \"mistake\". They wouldn't stop bashing me, saying how I only play meta decks and that its boring to play with me.\n\n2- Toon deck: I asked my friend if toons was a viable deck, since i didn't want to repeat the drytron situation. He said no, that it was gimmicky and non meta, so i went with it as they always looked quite fun. I absolutely destroy them with that deck. 3 turn kills, all BLS spam, they start saying its annoying, how I am a brain dead player with no strategy in mind.\n\n3- Monarchs: I once again ask, is monarchs viable as it seemed underpower with no extra deck and lots of tribute summons. they say its fine. I negate all their decks with my Domain. They are frustated that they can't have fun and use their extra deck\n\nAt this point I am tired, I have wasted all my gems and I am working on a Dragonmaid deck, because fuck them. I want to have fun playing this game but apparently all my choices are the wrong choices.",
            "20 deck slots? It\u2019s the first month and I have 5 complete decks without spending a cent. \n\n30 bookmarks? They were full with staples the first couple days. \n\nReally hope they increase these ASAP.",
            "I don\u2019t understand this shit and it\u2019s making me nuts. How can I go on a 12 game win streak in platinum, then get one win away from plat 1 and go on a 14 game in a row losing streak. \n\nSuddenly my opponents always have perfect hand traps, make no mistakes, never scoop, and I can\u2019t draw any of my staples or kaijus. Six kaijus in a 40 card deck, what are the chances I didn\u2019t draw a single one 14 games in a row. It\u2019s so frustrating. It\u2019s like the game knows you\u2019re almost there, and then screws you over on purpose. \n\nEvery time I get to plat 3, I face almost exclusively plat 1s. Then plat 2 finally. Drytron 5 games in a row.",
            "I put a win more card on my deck but I'm winning less, how could this be",
            "Ugh, maintenance. \n\nIs this what heroin withdrawal feels like?",
            "Would be nice if there is a \"in a nutshell\" compilation of what the meta decks are in the \"New Player Quick Tips\" section. Maybe it could be a new thread on its own? \n\nI suggest a format like this:\n\nDeck: Toons\n\nPlaystyle: Destroys opponents with monsters that can attack directly even when there are monsters on the opponents field.\n\nStrengths: Toon monsters can stay on the field even when destruction effects are activated and Comic Hand is a scary card that can turn the enemy's boss monster against them.\n\nWeakness: Without Toon Kingdom, the deck cries like a b\\*tch.\n\nThis could help players in choosing a deck they want to start playing with or find new decks to play with.\n\n(Note: Yes, I know Toons are not that hot. This is just an example).",

But then they suddenly break my board after figuring out an extensive combo. I have respect for those kind of players. they were probably writing down the step by step solution.",

            "Anyone know where to go to put in suggestions? I like this game but there are a few small things that bother me.\n\n1) I know I'm not alone about the card text being formatted weird. I would love if they broke up the text like on the card bc it's hard to tell when the condition ends and the action begins.\n\n2) in the duel pass screen, it always starts at level 1. Why not have it start at the current level? I know it's small but it's annoying to have to scroll through to see what rewards are coming up.\n\n3) this is REALLY minor, but editing the text for the title of a deck is weird on computer. It always defaults to having to rewrite the entire title rather than just one part.\n\n4) can we look at our cards WITHOUT going through the deck process? It's just tedious to have to go to deck menu, either create new or edit a current deck, all so I can just see if I do/don't have a certain card.",
            "Anyone else having a miserable experience since reset? I\u2019m not having fun anymore in Gold",
            "Anyone else have a problem dismantling a Royal Finish card, no matter how unlikely they are to ever play it? I just...can't bring myself to do it.",
            "Why the fuck does anyone play Numerons? I know people throw the word toxic around pretty carelessly but to me that deck is the definition of toxic. Surely at this point most people who see {Terraforming} or {Numeron Network} scoop if they're going second and don't have the outs to it. \n\nAnd yes, I know that this is another in a long line of Numeron hate posts, but seriously, fuck that deck.",

I\u2019ve got an optimised Virtual World so I\u2019m not desperate for anything but I\u2019d like to try something new out.

            "fellow speedroid players. It has come to my attention that in the sword soul meta turn 1 hi-speedroid clear wing rider is actually a good option to consider. the 2 clear wings you can float into actually both have relevant negates you can use. They can't get over 2500 without dipping into the extra deck for a monster however fast dragon can protect you from one attack by dropping them to 0. Clear wing synchro dragon's negates are usually a bit too specific however they actually both come into play against the main threats of the deck.",
            "MD's entire game state is broken. 17 of my last 20 duels online have been against bots, we're still laughably behind the physical card game's card pool, legacy tokens are still useless thanks to its archaic card pool that we can't dismantle, despite being the main online duel reward.\n\nThe only things that are smooth are decent gem opportunities for a FTP (before the bot issue) and festivals. Even the festivals are littered with stuff completely outside of most themes ie: Time Lords/Draccos.\n\nIt's obvious Konami didn't anticipate near the level of success this release would get and didn't plan accordingly, which is weird for what's supposed to be the \"ultimate Yugioh experience.\"",

I am so out of the loop and I am guessing ranking is busted but  my opponents first turn linked like 10 diff cards or so and special summoned a 9 star card. I killed it with a spell on my second turn and he ran out of cards in hand. I'm thinking I doing okay but his second turn, he was able to link 10 diff cards again and somehow special summoned two diff 7-9 star cards and killed me pretty much, while Im still in my beginner deck.\n\nIm exagerating the 10 linked cards but you guys prob know what I mean.",

Surprisingly Plat 1-Master5 is harder to push through than Master2-Master1. The latter is 90% Tear so maybe that helped in the predictability and what to tech in, whereas Plat is full of variety and like 50% Sprights, which is a lot harder for me to play against than Tear in my limited experience. They just have a gazillion extenders.\n\nPoetically enough I faced the deck (who is going to rank up too at that!) instead of the usual Tear in my rank up to Master1 but this time I am the 1st turn and he didn't have interruption. My intuition to set Retribution instead of Banishment paid dividends against Elf, and putting Baldrake instead of another Ash also greatly helped against Giant. It is sweet justice for how many times the deck has defeated me by going first.\n\nI still have a lot to learn, I am still intimidated by Maxx C which made me play unoptimally hundreds of time when I could have easily pushed through it and go for lethal. Shoutout to MDM, Vect0r and ShapestofSnatch for their videos and tutorials and decklists, really godsends in helping me understand the deck. Thats all and thank you.",

Let's say, if I'm at gold 1 rank, and promoted to plat 5, then if I lost a lot of times on plat 5, will I get demoted to gold? If yes, will I be demoted to gold 1 or straight to gold 5? Also, how many losses will demote me back to gold? \n\n\n2. I have a question bout pot of prosperity, once I activated it, the animation shows that 6 cards were excavated to show me to pick 1 card to my hand, and while that happening, can my opponent see what cards were excavated and sent to my hand?\n\n\n3. About pot of extravagance, the card description stated as \"at the start of main phase....\", So what if, I activate a trap card that I set on my previous turn before activating that pot of extravagance, I still can't activate that pot card right afterwards right\n\n\n4. Last question I got is, about xyz card effect, let's say my opponent summoned a xyz card during their turn and now it's my turn, and the card has effect stating:\" once per turn, you can detach 1 xyz material..... \" does that  mean that the opponent can only activate it during their turn only, not on mine right? Unless the card effect saying \"during either player turn...\"?\n\n\nThank you in advance for reading this and trying to answer my questions. I just want to learn and trying to get confirmations even though my questions seems like silly questions. Thanks again and have a good day!",

            "OK, I *really* hate the way that {Gozen Match}/{Rivalry of Warlords} prevents you from performing an extra deck summon of a monster, even if performing that summon could *only* be done by removing all monsters of other attributes/types from the field. If I only have a Water monster on my field, and the only monster I could summon is a link-1 Fire monster that must use that Water monster as material, what does the game *think* is going to happen when I perform that action? There's no card or mechanic that would allow both the Link monster and its material to be on the field at the same time. I would understand it if most extra deck summons worked like {Magnacarrier}, where you summon the thing and then attach materials/remove materials from the field. But they don't. If you negate the summon of an extra deck monster, the materials are still in the GY before that happens.\n\nYes, it's an official ruling, but it seems to me to be a *stupid* ruling that goes against the actual progression of actions in the game.",

Some people tend to go way too far and even hate the player for using the deck. \n\nThen if a new meta evolves and the deck becomes weaker, everyone goes to back to the old opinion and says that the deck is based and cool.\n\nI bet everyone says that playing Zoodiac Tri-Brigade is based now just because it's not the top meta deck anymore.\n\nA good example for this is the Branded/Despia Archetype. Mirrorjade will come out soon along with Branded Fusion and according to what most people say, it will become a very strong meta deck.\n\nI predict that in a couple weeks from now on people will start saying how toxic and unfair Mirrojade is and how it's not healthy for the game bla bla bla.\n\nLet's say this is objectively true, but if it is, why bother getting hyped about the card in the first place if you will inevitably hate it anyways?\n\nThis mindset seems so weird to me. And then after a couple of months you pretend that you never hated the card at all and start liking it again? \n\nCan someone explain the thought-process behind this?\nI'd be glad if a veteran player could share their thoughts about this too.\n\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nPeople are getting hyped about new cards, then start to hate them when they become part of a meta deck. After they fall off the meta, people like the cards again and say that it's cool and based to play with them.\n\nIs this statement true or false? And if it's true why do people have this kind of mindset? Seems weird to me.\n\n\n**Edit:** btw, I don't try to generalize the community. Of course this doesn't necessarily have to apply to anyone.",

            "So your one card combo to Colossus is Gold Sarc > Banish Dragondark > Search Dragonhawk > Discard Hawk to revive Dark > Tribute Dark for Colossus. Other combo lines typically revolve around using Aloof Lupine + Thunder Dragon in hand and banishing Dark/Roar depending on what you need. Whether you get Fusion or Dragonhawk depends on if you opened the original Thunder Dragon, since Colossus requires the original to be fused with a fusion spell. Buster lock is optional, but I\u2019ve found some success with Aloof > Banish Dark + Roar > Search Hawk + special Dark > Tribute 1 Dark for Colossus, discard Hawk to revive the other Dark/Roar, make Union Carrier with 2 monsters and Colossus with the other. Keep in mind this leaves you vulnerable for Nibiru. If you have OG + Fusion in hand it\u2019s possible to make Colossus + Buster Lock in 4 summons. \n\nVerte Anaconda is only if you end up with a bad hand but you can make Anaconda that turn. Thunder Dragon Fusion is both the best and the worst fusion spell in the game since it shuffles resources back from GY/Field/Banish. On one hand, that lets Thundras grind hard, on the other, using it too much leaves Colossus/Titan open to Raigeki. But the follow-up from Fusion is amazing since it lets you search *any* Thunder monster. Good choices are Denko Sekka to shut down facedowns, Chaos Creator for extending, and Dragonroar to re-add Fusion to hand to make another Titan.\n\nChaos Variant adds more consistency to the deck, while Pure can play Dimension Shifter. Chaos uses White Dragon Wyverbuster, Black Dragon Collapserpent, Chaos Creator, and 3x Chaos Spaces. The White/Black dragons can banish Dark/Light monsters from the GY respectively, so that makes Dark + Chaos Space in hand a great combo starter. It also lets you run Hieratic Seals of the Heavenly Spheres as a form of disruption. Pure I don\u2019t have as much experience with, but DShifter does shut down like\u2026 every deck. Except Floowandereeze.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention Verte is also a good way to end out games, since 2 Titans + 1 Colossus is enough dmg to break 8k LP.",

Hell, your definition even says Ecchi is mostly teasing and innuendos. Please, tell me, what about this is just \u201cteasing\u201d or an \u201cinnuendo\u201d? \n\nActually, bigger question. Why do you fight so much about this not being nsfw? Do you have something to prove or do you have something to hide?",
            "Since you\u2019re apparently too lazy/dense to correct yourself, here I\u2019ll do it for you:\n\n###NSFW (Not Safe for Work)\n\nNSFW is an acronym commonly used on the internet to label content that is inappropriate for viewing in a professional or public setting. This type of content often includes explicit sexual material, nudity, strong language, or graphic violence. The label serves as a warning to viewers that the material may not be suitable for all audiences and should be viewed in private.\n\n###Ecchi\n\nEcchi is a term derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the letter \u201cH,\u201d which stands for \u201chentai,\u201d though it has a milder connotation. In anime and manga, ecchi refers to content that is sexually suggestive or provocative but does not cross into explicit pornography. This might include scenes of characters in revealing clothing, accidental nudity, or situations with sexual undertones, often used for comedic effect. Ecchi is more about titillation and humor rather than explicit content.\n\n###The Difference\n\nThe primary difference between NSFW and ecchi lies in the level of explicitness and cultural context:\n\n\t1. Explicitness: NSFW can encompass a wide range of explicit content, including pornography, graphic violence, and strong language, making it unsuitable for public or workplace viewing. Ecchi, on the other hand, is suggestive but not explicit, focusing more on teasing and innuendo without showing explicit sexual acts.\n\t2. Cultural Context: NSFW is a general internet term used globally to mark content inappropriate for work environments. Ecchi is specific to Japanese anime and manga, where it denotes a genre that is playful and flirtatious rather than overtly sexual.\n\nSo, while both terms refer to content that might not be suitable for all audiences, NSFW is a broader and more explicit category, whereas ecchi is more about playful sexual suggestiveness within the context of Japanese media.\n\n##The playmat shown in this post does not show nudity or any explicit sexual material so, it is **not** NSFW\n\nMaybe educate yourself before commenting next time",
            "What it stands for and what it\u2019s actually used to mean are 2 different things",
            "That is not **my** definition it is **the** definition. As said in those definitions, the difference is how explicit the content is. This image is not overly sexual in any way and she is not nude. It\u2019s just suggestive. That by itself is not NSFW. Again, not being NSFW does not mean that it is appropriate.\n\nI am not fighting at all, I am simply correcting people who have come crying to me trying to **fight** that it is NSFW.\n\nYet elsewhere in the thread someone even posted an **official** live twin mat which is very similar to the mat in the post.",
            "I\u2019ll recite this entire Chat GPT generated garbage to the HR department as they\u2019re explaining when my last check will arrive and when my insurance benefits expire.",
            "Ironic claiming others are crying when you started crying the second someone called this nsfw. The live twin mat you\u2019re talking about is more along the \u201cecchi\u201d lines as while the alt art kis-sikil and li-la cards are suggestive, they are not so prominently sexual to the point of having almost no clothes on like the playmat in the post\n\nAlso wait, you claimed there was \u201cnothing wrong\u201d with the playmat and that konami should allow it. So you apparently DO think it\u2019s appropriate for tournaments that a very wide age group attend.",
            "Wow. Sorry, I should\u2019ve expected a yugioh player to lack simple reading comprehension. I\u2019ll simplify it for you.\n\nNSFW may stand for not safe for work however that is not the definition of NSFW.\n\nThe image on this playmat is not NSFW. The fact that it is not NSFW however, does **not** mean that it is appropriate to use in work.\n\nThat better or is it still too difficult for you to understand?",
            "Wow at this point you\u2019re just admitting that you can\u2019t understand the difference between facts and opinions and lack simple reading comprehension. Well done.",
            "Please touch grass",
            "Fun how you claim that I have poor reading comprehension and cannot \u201cunderstand the difference between fact and opinion\u201d when you have yet to make a single claim about why this mat, or anything similar, should be allowed at a kid\u2019s card game event.",
            "That\u2019s your only response now? How pathetic. So sorry you apparently lack an education.\n\nAnd you\u2019re on Reddit\u2026 in a master duel sub\u2026 telling people to touch grass? The irony there lmao",
            "I did not once say that but fine\u2026\n\nThis card is not NSFW. That does not mean that it is appropriate. That\u2019s fact.\n\nIn my opinion however, there is nothing wrong with using mats like these. They do not affect the game in any way. It\u2019s not as if you can somehow use a game mat to cheat.\n\nThat does not mean that these mats should be used at all times in public spaces. **where** you are using them needs to be taken into consideration and there simply needs to be rules put in place for that.\n\nFor example if this is a tournament where kids are participating then these mats should not be allowed. However if there are no kids present and  there are only participants aged 18+ then there is no issue.\n \nThis is not solely a kids card game. It\u2019s for people of all ages and that needs to be taken into consideration. There is no need for all this needless censoring in most cases. If there are kids present, do not use these mats. If there are no kids involved, use whatever mat you want. \n\n###Simple."
