It was not until my 3 friends (1 im close with, 2 not really) started to discuss it outside of the stall that I realized what I had done. They all started to laugh uncontrollably. I was mortified. There was also a stranger in there who started to say it\u2019s normal etc. AgainC everyone seemed pretty drunk but this quickly turned into the worst moment of my life. I was laughing with my bestie after but I still felt horrible. About 10 minutes later I still felt horrible and began to tear up and eventually cry in the social. My close friend tried to reassure me that it happens to everyone but I still felt horrible. On my way home I began to bawl my eyes out and started to think of other embarrassing moments in the past. Is there a better way to handle this situation? ",

Honestly, in my adult life, the only person who EVER had an issue is my neighbor-from-hell who, long story short, I caught spying (best way to put it without going into the full story) during my bathroom time. Basically, I called him out, called him a perv, and let him know I had proof of his spying and inappropriateness.

In fact, if they were to dwell on it, then they would be weird and it wouldn\u2019t be a reflection on you. What happened isn\u2019t the problem, but how much it is impacting you, consider treatment for anxiety and remember that alcohol is a depressant so try not to have too much in social settings, even though you might think it makes you feel more confident temporarily it could make you feel worse in the long run, like breaking down over something ultimately insignificant.

Once you know the your specific issue(s) you can start to implement better coping or known treatments. \n\nKnowing it\u2019s an issue is a good first step.

I was confused because I wasn\u2019t saying or doing anything vulgar and was ashamed because I had no idea what I was doing wrong.\n\nDon\u2019t let these people keep you miserable. If they care about you they would have no problem itemising the behaviours you display that they deem rude or obnoxious. Just ask them",

            "The issue here is learning when something is about to go off the rails *in real time.*\n\nIf your friends have told you specifically what went wrong afterwards and you have not been able to self correct, then you need a different approach.  Role play/social stories/scripting can be very useful, as everyone has mentioned. \n\n This is what would be involved:  Ask your (former) friends to describe the situation, how you responded, why it was weird, and what a more socially acceptable response would have been.  Or at least bring the situations you know about to a therapist \n\nHow do you learn best?  If visually, write it all down and study.  If aurally/orally, record the information and then repeat it back out loud.  \n\nThen the role play.  You ask a couple of folks to rehearse the situations with you.  Just like an actor in a play, or an improv troupe, you go over and over the material until it becomes second nature.\n\nIt may be hard work.  It may feel weirdly mechanical.

Like, no thoughts. Just observing what is happening around me and then deciding what the best course of action is. Whether it is a polite comment to keep things going or simply allowing others to fill the space. When I am not in my head I cannot get nervous about what people think and therefore mess up less.

            "It\u2019s interesting that you mention age 11/12. You don\u2019t have to answer, and it may trigger a trauma flashback, but did anything happen then? Like for me, I\u2019m stuck at age 6. No therapist has been able to do anything. I kind of accept it. My grandfather died and I wasn\u2019t allowed to see him just before nor go to the funeral. I basically dissociated from life at that point because he was the only male who loved me and was present. I make fun of situations like a six year old when I think people are stuck up about something.\n\nWhat I do to fix myself is a deep dive into the horoscope. That\u2019s all I have to go by because the few friends I have have never said how blunt I am, and my family encouraged me to be blunt. Piece by piece have I made sense of why I act practically identically to how you describe yourself. It seems to be part aspergers, forced socialization, trying to fit in, not self-regulating quite the right way, and not getting the right feedback.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe in metaphysics I totally understand. But if you do, know that how each of us comes across is practically impossible to gauge from our own perspective. We need others to tell us. The horoscope can give us an idea.\n\nTell people that you can handle the feedback. Not everybody witnesses our behavior in every situation so something is going to be left out. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. Maybe it\u2019s much simpler than what you think. In my case (again), apparently I have a strong upper class accent is what I call it. Nobody told me until someone let it slip when I was 42 years old. No wonder kids at school treated me a certain way let alone everyone else later at work.

            "As someone that has been bullied when younger, and doesn't get bullied now, I'd say you're on the correct path in the \"not being bullyable\" path of thinking. What I gather is that bullying often comes from insecurity and make themselves feel better by pushing others down. And thus, my remedy has come in the form of making people feel better without them needing to put anyone down. \n\nThis can be done by building a stronger personality (wit, humour, interests, ... ) and listening skills (empathy, active listening, ... ), so that people enjoy being around you, without any subtle power hierarchies needing to be created. This is way harder and more comlicated than what can be summarized in a single Reddit comment, but \"How to win friends and influence people\" might be a solid read to help build these qualities.",

There's just something monstrous in a lot of people during social situations that doesn't come out until they realize someone is different than them.

It sounds pessimistic, but most people really do suck and there's no point in trying to be friends with them. Just don't make your relationship any worse than it has to be if they're someone you have to be around a lot, like coworkers. For friendship, you just have to find people that like you for how you are. A lot of people just aren't accepting to people that don't exactly fit in with them or their friends or people like them.",

People can pick up on weakness quite quickly which is why once they\u2019ve sussed you out they start pushing your boundaries. \n\nThe best thing you can do is be try to be friendly and approachable, but also come across as confident and not an easy target. Even if you have to fake it, especially with body language. Bully\u2019s will always pick on people they think won\u2019t fight back. \n\nWould it be fair to say you\u2019re not the most confident person? Are you socially awkward? \n\nTry to come across as confident and friendly and 99% of people will be fine with you.

            "Ultimately, what makes people bullyable is their reaction to it. You want to dodge learning to deal with the bullying by not being bullyable in the first place, but that's not really possible, because your reactivity to and inability to deal with the bullying is exactly what makes you bullyable in the first place. The ***only way*** to become unbullyable is by learning not to take it personally. There are a number of tactics to achieve this, such as laughing at yourself or grey rocking, but ultimately what is at the core of all of these strategies is that they are ways to not allow their comments to affect you.\n\nWhat people are doing when they bully you is asserting themselves as being above you in a social hierarchy. They seek to gain recognition that they are better than you-- that they are assertive and have social power. It is a dominance game. You probably feel that you don't want to play this game. You didn't sign up to be in a competition of egos. It is unwanted. But whether you like it or not, it is part of society. It is a bit of social jiu jitsu to show the bully that you do not care about their bullying. Being unaffected by it wins the battle for you, and gives you the clout that the bully was seeking. Every time you refute their efforts, you gain social standing, and eventually you will have enough that you will no longer be seen as an easy target. That is when the bullying stops.",

If you're experiencing this often, you're going to have to be more introspective and observe what the most liked people in the groups are saying and doing. \n\nSocial interactions are tricky in group dynamics. Generally if someone bullies another, that just makes them a bully. But normal people can sometimes shun others subconsciously. Friend groups who have been friends for a while stay friends because they enjoy the overall vide from the group. You have to ask yourself if you \"fit in\" or if you're inserting yourself in a way that changes the desired vide. Usually the person that messes up the vide is a contrarian who doesnt understand the group dynamic. \n\nWith that said, you can actually remain true to yourself and be yourself.

Those people usually think they are being their authentic selves, so they don't understand why you aren't behaving like everyone else.\n\nThose who don't fit into society as a stereotype or character of a person will feel this way.

Example if you keep laughing at things that aren't funny, trying to pass off \"charming\", it pisses off some people.\n\nAdd some \"people pleaser\" in the mix and people will bully you or put you down just so they could express their feelings towards you.
