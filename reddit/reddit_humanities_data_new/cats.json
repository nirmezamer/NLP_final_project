When the subreddit started the rule \"Content must be about cats\" made sense, but we do not need to expressly codify this anymore. We're not a small community these days and it has not happened in years that someone posted a bunny rabbit instead of a cat. We will of course still remove off-topic content but do not see the need to clutter up the rules page with something that our community understands to be self-evident. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe will likely make minor edits and additions to this new rule-set in the coming weeks until everything is just the way we like it, but the rules as posted now are the general framework from which we will do so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have kept our rules broadly worded so they can encompass many topics and so we do not need to codify for every single possibility. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most important rules are at the top. Our number one rule is to respect each other. This for example includes following rediquette and sitewide rules, but also our subreddit-specific rule of not attacking other posters for not raising their pets to your satisfaction. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur rule about spam, memes and self-promotion includes  accounts that do not directly promote their content, but which nevertheless primarily exist to drive content to their NSFW stores like Onlyfans. Everyone is welcome to post here, but NSFW sellers can do so on a seperate, SFW account. We do not allow memes as they are most often posted as easy karma-grabs instead of genuine engagement. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd so on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our new ruleset via the link at the top of this thread and give your feedback in a comment below. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for helping us make this space the wonderful community that it is and we hope you enjoy your time here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe r/cats mod team",

My dad loved to tell the story.\n\nThere was a real cat hoarder lady that lived next door, had the cats outside all the time (way more common in the uk where we are but still), never properly looked after them because she had so many. My parents used to put food out for the birds and the cats would come to try to eat the food, so my dad would run out and scare them off. They would all run apart from one, this little tabby girl. My dad couldn't go anywhere in the garden without her trailing around him. She would sneak into the house umtil they heard happy purring and clock that she was there. If you so much as gestured near your lap while sitting she would hop up for cuddles. They had told the lady before that the cat would try and enter the house sometimes, but she never asked after her or check in even when the cat wouldn't show for feeding times.\nSo the lady next door was moving house and came by saying 'oh i think I'm missing one of the cats, have you seen her?', to which my father just replied no.\nShe was happily asleep in the house in her favourite spot again.

Crossing their paws can be a comfortable resting position for cats, allowing them to evenly distribute their weight and remain poised for action. It also showcases their relaxed state, indicating that they feel safe and secure in their environment.\n\nFrom ancient Egypt to the modern living room, the tradition of the gentlemanly cat has been a fascinating and enduring part of feline history. The simple act of crossing their paws is more than just a cute quirk; it is a testament to the elegance, grace, and timeless charm that cats have embodied for millennia.

Because I already owned 3 cats, one for each of my sons.\n\nWell this new cat, who boldly walked right into my house was NOT my cat!  He hopped on my sofa and immediately fell asleep.  When he woke up, I shooed him back out the front door, because he was a GORGEOUS cat and I was sure he was someone's beloved pet.\n\nWent to get the mail at 1pm when the kids were napping and he literally fell into the house!  He was sleeping against the door.\n\nClearly, he was not leaving.  We were his new people. He lived with me to the ripe old age of 18.

            "I never thought I\u2019d be picked. But now I tell people you just have to trust the system.",
            "It was over on day 2 when he was looking at me like this\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4622hcffd08d1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=baa3f7646c070f9a1d0022d62a02612984fb3e93",
            "Same. My wife was telling me no more animals when I called her to come get him. This is exactly what I told her. A week later she\u2019s telling me that we dont HAVE to adopt him out lol",
            "I wish there were more people like you!",
            "Lol so I started calling him Doug when I was planning on adopting him out and then we kept him.\n\nSo his name is Douglas, it was too late to change it \ud83d\ude02",
            "Haha totally does! He got me good",
            "To me that first picture says he is skeptical of my rental application and that I might not be the caliber of resident they\u2019re looking for at Wyndham Oaks.",
            "That I am! ![img](emote|t5_2qhta|7984)",
            "Thank you!! Lucy is the white tabby. She was found under a trailer nearby and we snagged her up and Bean is the gray and white cat we were able to adopt him from a shelter that pulls cats from kill shelters. Couldn\u2019t imagine life without all of them.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ndtcsp99e18d1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27bf4ea5a38b063c4e9da622e764c894ae97bc1f",
            "If that were the case I\u2019d help. \n\nBut there are a fair amount of feral cats around my hospital. I think he climbed up in it himself and got stuck.\n\nI started feeding/trapping the ferals and getting them fixed to help slow the population. Hopefully it\u2019ll make a difference",
            "I'm stealing this. Also, 100% right.",
            "Such a cool story! From the back your cat looks like our cat Bean!",
            "Awh, Doug is the same way he very rarely meows. \n\nGuess he used them all up to get saved too.",
            "Yeah, total fail...he looks so bored & uncomfortable forced to sleep on his back exposing his vulnerable tender underbelly...probably sleeps like that from being coddled & regular feeding, what's wrong with you? You take a perfectly independent cat out of a car engine and give him what in return? A home, a bed, too much love, and, worse, make him adopt an adult human.  \nJust kidding, of course, he hit the human & household lottery! So happy looking cat!",
            "he's so handsome",

            "My cat got dropped on me out of nowhere at my JOB, I wanted nothing to do with him he wasn\u2019t my responsibility and I was really upset I somehow ended up with an animal when my boss was the one who adopted him.\n\nYeah that didn\u2019t last lol it\u2019s been a year and a half, I can\u2019t imagine life without my little grey goblin anymore \ud83d\ude02\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ol1ky7cpk18d1.jpeg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=210798e8a290d5702e8bf4543f85d5d32de4dc82",
