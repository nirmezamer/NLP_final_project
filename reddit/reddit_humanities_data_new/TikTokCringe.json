Click the \"Cringe\" flair link above and see for yourself. We believe it doesn't get upvoted or posted as much as everything else because since the creation of this subreddit, TikTok has really evolved. People are a lot more creative on the app nowadays and don't just lip-sync and dance, which is what this subreddit was originally created off of.\n\n\"**Why did you start allowing all TikToks? Mods lazy.\"**\n\nFor why we began allowing TikToks of all kinds, please read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/fyrgzy/for_those_confused_by_the_name_of_this_subreddit/). It should explain everything.\n\n\"**Can I upload my own TikToks here?\"**\n\nSure! Be sure when uploading your own content you always use the \"OC (I made this)\" flair. Not using this flair on your own content will result in a 30 day ban. It may seem like a stupid punishment for something so little, but this helps prevent spam and blatant self advertisement. On top of that, do you really think someone should be able to call their own TikTok \"cringe?\" Doesn't make any sense. Rules like these are what keeps up the quality of this subreddit.\n\n**\"How do I post TikToks here?\"**\n\nFirst, read all of our rules before posting anything. To post a TikTok here, you must **save** the TikTok in the app, not copy the link. We do not allow links of any kind here. If you would like to share the link to the TikTok you uploaded, feel free to comment it on the post you made, even though this is not required. You can save TikToks by holding down on the video in the app and pressing save. If there's no option to save the video, there's alternate ways such as clicking the \"add to your Instagram story\" option which you can then download, or emailing it to yourself. After you save the video, simply create a video post here with the desired TikTok, add a title and flair, and then boom. You're done.\n\n\"**Why is there an automod comment on every post and who the hell is** [u/BotOrMiss](https://www.reddit.com/u/BotOrMiss/)?\"\n\nWe need an automod comment on every post to explain everything you just read. Our subreddit name does not match it's content, and it can obviously be very confusing to new users. Some people still miss it somehow, so if you see someone that did, be a good Samaritan and point it out to them. As for [u/BotOrMiss](https://www.reddit.com/u/BotOrMiss/), this is our bot that basically just replaces the automod comment on any post that reaches the top 1000 of [r/all](https://www.reddit.com/r/all/). The bot notifies me because I like to pay attention to and moderate these posts especially. You may also see this bot comment on your post if it was removed because of our removal system we use.\n\nFeel free to ask any further questions you have and we'd love to hear your suggestions. We're always looking for ways to improve our community.\n\nWelp, that's it. If you actually read all of this, we appreciate it and owe you a huge thanks. We hope you enjoy your time spent here and get to know our wonderful community.",

So Netflix can blast a hose of data towards your endpoint over satellite and it will be, for the most part, crisp and smooth.\n\nBut when you try to do something like play a game, which requires TCP, that's when traditional satellite really *sucks* because the server has to send you a packet, it has to arrive intact, then your computer has to send a packet back telling the server it received the original packet all before the server will send the next packet. All of that happening over a wire or fiber connection is fine, but when you introduce dozens of milliseconds of latency for every single transaction that's when you'd see people with satellite internet with pings measuring over 1000ms.",

There is an enough sodium in those chicken, pickle, bread monsters to make your guts into a charcuterie board. Even McDonald's chicken sandwich has less sodium and at least they bother to throw some vegde on it. The chicken is lacking fat and has very little crunch. Tell me I'm wrong that the primary flavors are industrial pickle juice, peanut oil, and sugar. Hey, maybe that's your jam?

Their food isn\u2019t the best, but it is good, and I can get through a 15 person line there faster than 3 people just about anywhere else. It\u2019s more on other fast food restaurants honestly with how far the normal standards have fallen. Everything is expensive, slow, tastes worse, and has shitty service, especially since the pandemic. Chick-fil-a actually keeps a standard, and that\u2019s what keeps people going there. I don\u2019t go very often because it gets expensive, but I rarely leave disappointed, and I can\u2019t say that about almost anywhere else.",
            "Most fast food places have really bad chicken imo. Chick fil a is pretty good in comparison especially since they offer grilled instead of just fried. It's still just fast food, though. Not gonna act like it's the best chicken sandwich money can buy.",
            "Their chicken may not be to die for, but it's still a good fast food restaurant. One of the tops for me at least. HELL of a lot better than Arby's that's just insulting and McD is personal preference. Their chicken is juicy and has good crust, the wraps are fairly flavorful, milkshakes are tasty and the fries are crunchy. Though the frozen lemonade is god tier and I will do on that hill. Their lemonade especially frozen, just hits different. I have an absurd weakness ro lemonade though, so that's why.\n\nI've hardly been exposed to their marketing, but I do know about it. I wouldn't say it has much of an effect, or I guess as much affect as a cow asking to not be eaten has on an omnivore. I wouldn't say it's a \"societal level\" of mass convincing at all. It's a good place, and it has its fanatics. But that applies to every restaurant chain big or small",
            "It's definitely not a marketing thing, it could be a regional thing, though.\n\n\n\u00a0Around here, mcdonalds and arby's is fucking disgusting. Mcdonald's chicken sandwiches are 40% tendon/gristle and if i bite into a single piece of that rubbery bullshit, i'm done with that whole sandwich. \u00a0\n\n\nChick-fil-a makes a proper spicy chicken sandwich that's spicy on it's own.\u00a0\n\n\nMcdonald's spicy chicken requires a spicy mayo concoction to be slathered on it so you end up with a soggy, sopping wet sandwich mess in foil-paper bag.\u00a0\n\n\nPopeye's spicy chicken also requires sauce to be spicy, the chicken itself is plain.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe best fast food spicy chicken sandwiches are made by wendy's and chick-fil-a, but chick-fil-a has that frosted lemonade and those waffle fries that are never soggy.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Thank you for coming to my spicy chicken sandwich ted talk. \u00a0Subscribe for more nonsense you didn't ask for and don't care about.",
            "I mean it\u2019s still a franchise, the location I worked at was owned by a \u201cgood Christian\u201d man that insisted we all go the extra 40 miles for the customers but wouldn\u2019t even give us a discount on a meal unless we worked for more than 4 hours. But the location a few miles away the staff could eat for free anytime they worked and they actually had morale so it\u2019s still just as much of a roll of the dice as when you go to any other franchised restaurant.",

It\u2019s fast food, of course it\u2019s an average chicken sandwich but we live in a country that prides itself on poisoning its citizens with the lowest quality ingredients and enough corn syrup to give a small village type 2 diabetes in a sitting.

Usually not in there for more than a minute.  The big offenders for me are CFA, Burger King, and a Chinese place that does a lot of delivery business that always seems to be 3 orders behind.  McD is also pretty good on the snap, Popeyes is the actual worst, I boycotted them completely.  They do have good chicken as a customer but the line is horrendous and they close the dining room whenever they can.",
            "One time I saw an article talking about Chick Fil A being slow and I was sooo confused. I feel like you don\u2019t even put your car in park in the drive thru lol. They are so well-run and crazy fast. Definitely the move when you\u2019re in a hurry",
            "You haven't been to Arby's in ten years. Their stuff is top-notch. Rueben is bomb, the gyros are awesome, and the seasonal fried fish sandwich is friggin huge",

            "Oh totally this. It\u2019s why I don\u2019t  support Blue Moon for example. Last I heard they contributed to conservative bills against LGBT. Obviously there\u2019s some things that it\u2019s harder to do that with like oil for your car or if your phone company switches to a conservative CEO or merges. I do, however, think that if there\u2019s an option that you can switch to or can avoid then try to do that.",
            "Oh man, I gave up all of my drive through orders after 8pm because that just seems to be time that all of the dining rooms close and Oregon appears to have decided that drive thru stands for 1 hour parking. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve had to sit and wait for 45 minutes just to get to the box at any of the big drive up chains out here. Both for deliveries and as a customer.",
