I prefer jumping out of the airplane without the parachute.\n* 5: Same thing as 4 but now I have to worry about Azula too.\n* 6: Same thing as 5 but now I have to worry about Bumi and Toph suddenly deciding to have a contest inside the airplane and taking down the airplane by accident.\n* 7: Same as 6, except I won't have to listen to Mai and Zuko quarreling.\n* 8: I have to worry only about Toph and Bumi now, it could be fine.\n\nI'm gonna go with 3 and spend a nice time drinking tea with Iroh and two fascinating ladies.",
