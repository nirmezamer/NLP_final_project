            "I had mold remediation done in my bathroom a couple years ago and it cost me $5,000. My mold was way worse than this though. If you wanted to fight them on it you could get a air quality/mold presence test done and base your counter off of those results. If the results are within the acceptable range of air quality standards you can just tell them no. If it comes back significantly higher than the outdoor air then they might have a point. \n\nObviously you do have a moisture issue somewhere because there is mold on those sheets and not on others, so something is happening that if you weren't selling I would say is worth looking into why that's happening.",
            "I mean, it's up to you whether you take his advice. But estimate what it would cost to remediate the problem. If i were the buyer, I'd probably go the route of asking the current owner to remediate the issue and provide proof of remediation or an inspection confirming there is no mold anymore. That way it doesn't become the buyers problem to deal with after the sale. \n\nWhen we purchased our house something similar happened, except that it was the banks appraiser that spotted what looked like mold. The bank wouldn't approve our mortgage until it was remediated and there was documented proof of remediation.",
            "How does the inspector tell anyone how much to lower a price? He is there to inspect, not be part of a real estate transaction. That is Resltors job.\nThat said, that attic does not look all that bad. Of course context is important. Is that from a bathroom vent? Lack of attic ventilation? Plumbing vent not going out thru roof? \nSource: inspector for 30 years.",
            "Did he test for mold? I\u2019m a licensed home inspector in Texas and if you don\u2019t test for mold, you never use that word. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not mold, but that\u2019s a lawsuit waiting to happen if the inspector says mold without testing. \n\nRealistically there is mold in every home, you just want to avoid harmful types or levels. Also, inspectors should not have any opinion on home prices.",
            "Yeah that's a lot of mold looks like poor ventilation not leaks. Or maybe the bathroom is vented directly into the attic, or kitchen vent. Plywood is going to have to be replaced to really fix it, although you could try chemicals.",
            "I\u2019ve sprayed my attic with a product that completely removed any mold. Of course found out why there\u2019s mold there in the first place. Could be a disconnected bathroom vent fan or poor attic ventilation",
            "That's not a thing inspectors do, you might have mold but knowing how much it'll cost to fix is outside the scope of the 3 weeks inspector certification course",
            "Some of the top comments so far are so Reddit. Attic mold remediation costs like $500, so no do NOT listen to people saying \"yeah dude take $10k off so you don't have to deal with it\" \n\nAlso it was the buyer's inspector suggesting that you drop $10k. The selling price has zero to do with them so what's going on there? My guess is buyer's RE agent is the one who got them to hire their inspector buddy. It's common and sleazy.\n\nGet your attic remediated, don't lower your asking price, provide receipt. I was on the buyer side of this once and that's how we handled it, no problems. I certainly didn't try to knock $10k off like a clown buyer. If they don't agree, then send them on their merry way\n\nTo everyone else reading this wrong: OP is the seller, the buyer's inspector is the one attempting this tactic",
            "Something about this doesn't make sense.\n\nA home inspector should be inspecting the home and providing you a report of their findings.  If he's a great inspector familiar with the market, he might be able to give you some ballpark idea of the fixes that would be needed and a ballpark estimate of the price, but even that would be beyond his responsibilities.\n\nThe inspector giving you negotiating advice seems incredibly suspect.  Is he encouraging you to have mold remediation done by a friend of his?",
            "Not really sure where a home inspector gets off telling the buyer how much to ask off on a price. Their job is to report found issues. Not give pricing advice. Does he or his family own a mold remediation business and did he also push the clients to them? Seems kinda fishy.",
            "21 years as a home inspector here. Your inspector has no business giving you that advice and likely violated several standards in the process. \n\nIt looks like you're in a townhome which is more common for this to occur due to the reduced air flow in the stoic since you're only getting airflow from the front and back. Several other factors can contribute to this. This is generally superficial in nature but you usually have an underlying air flow issue that needs to be addressed. \n\nThat said, due to the way air rises up and through a house and attic this is generally not a health concern. It's very hard to pull that air down into a living space where it can affect occupants. However, in a perfect world you never want organic growth as when you go to sell in the future you might have a buyer with an inspector like yours that over stepped and over alarmed their client. Realistically this can be treated by a GC for less than half what your inspector dreamed up. Have your realtor get you quotes for treatment and make sure they address casual factors and price warranty. If you really are in a townhouse you may need to involve the HOA to properly address.",

            "That inspector was in the wrong for suggesting you take 10k off the price. Now the buyer has that price figure in their head and will not be happy with anything less than that. Additionally, if yo do fix the issue and submit a $5k receipt, they\u2019ll think you got the cheapest contractor.\n\nComing from a recent buyer, prepare for the buyers to walk if they don\u2019t get what they want. But don\u2019t lose $10k over this.",
            "Roof sheathing is OSB?!?! My Floridian contractor brain can\u2019t comprehend this",
            "The inspector personally told you that? My assumption is the buyer wants 10,000 off and is using this as leverage so they\u2019re not the bad guy.\n\n\u201cOh the inspector told me this should be $10k off\u201d sounds better than asking for the reduction outright",
            "Where did you get the idea that the inspector said to take off $10k? Did the buyers or their realtor say that? If so, it doesn't mean anything other than they want a flimsy excuse to knock the price down by $10k. \n\nThat mold could easily be from something that was already fixed, it's doesn't appear to be very significant. The mold discoloration wouldn't go away unless it was cleaned, and most wouldn't bother with something like that if they fixed the moisture intrusion that caused it.",
            "I personally think it's a bit weird, and a bit inappropriate, for the inspector to be telling you anything related to cost.\n\nThe procedure that is most fair and equitable is for your agent to provide the listing agent with the report, and for the two of them to work together to get three quotes from different contractors, average the value, and subtract that from the list price. \n\nThis is assuming the seller is willing to lower the price over the mold, which is not a given.",
            "The proper path is to have a mould remediation company do a site visit and provide a quote. Then negotiate from there. In my area, that's 2-4K unless the sheathing is rotted.",
            "Get an inspection by a mold remediation company. They will be able to tell you what needs to be done and how much it will cost. Then negotiate.",
            "Too bad inspectors aren\u2019t equipped or licensed to properly identify mold. This happened to us when selling years ago. The inspector wrote \u2018mold\u2019 and it\u2019s just a trigger, leaving the buyer open to making a request, but that\u2019s all they can do. If they ask for a mold test you can allow it, might give everyone peace of mind. \n\nWanna know what happened when our buyers tried that with us? We paid a restoration company to \u2018sand and vacuum\u2019 the spot in the attic. Then they \u2018sealed it\u2019. Nothing looks any different. It was caused by a disconnected exhaust vent from the dryer (second story laundry room). The attic looks the same, smells the same, feels the same. Not one mold test performed. The buyers accepted this. Cost us maybe $300.",
            "Just had a deal go south due to the same thing. Not that it had to die, but there were other factors and the mold was the buyer's \"out\". \n\nLooked just like this. It was due to poor air flow. Needed remediation and then the fix to prevent it was just to pull back the insulation and put in more baffles.\n\nThe quote we got came in just under $5k for remediation for about a 1000sqft house (Michigan). It included a night work premium, as the company would not work in an attic in the daytime in the middle of summer. \n\nGood mold remediation companies will probably not just do some kind of quick fix. They want to do their best so that the issue will not reoccur. The buyer should get multiple quotes for the remediation in order to inform the credit/reduction. \n\nTo answer \"whose job is this?\"\n\nInspector: identify any defects in the house, including possible environmental hazards. \n\nMold remediation company: provide a recommendation for remediation and quote the cost.\n\nBuyer's agent: recommend to buyer how to address this with seller (price reduction, credit on close, fix the issue, etc). Communicate with your agent to negotiate.\n\nYour agent: communicate with you. Explain the findings and their implications (difficulties selling if it goes back on the market as-is without remedying, being required to disclose presence of mold if buyer walks). Negotiate on your behalf.",
            "Standard, home inspectors are a negotiating tactic, your real estate agent should have prepped you for this. First step is to decide if you tell the buyer to pound sand or open negotiation. Second is to get your own inspection and quote to fix. Then either decide to fix it yourself before sale or offer the price to remediate to the buyer as a concession and have them deal with after the sale. Simple.",
            "Home inspector with a background in mould remediation. Get a quote from a remediation contractor, fix the moisture / ventilation issue. 10 grand is an arbitrary number the buyers realtor pulled out of their ass.",
            "Some buyers will ask for a price reduction but will not perform repairs and remediation after the purchase - they think they pocketed the money, but in fact, they ignored something that could kill them. \n\nHow much does mold remediation cost around you? You can reduce your price by that much (it\u2019s the money you\u2019ll spend anyways to remediate the mold before the next person sees it if these buyers walk).",
            "I just sold and had mold remidiated in basement and attic. Cost me 3k",
            "10K should be considered to be a ballpark estimate. Tell the seller that you found mold, and tell them that you need some more time for the inspection contingency because of it if they do not want to give you more time on the contingency tell them $10,000, and then schedule some more people to come by to give you a better estimate.",
            "You should ask them to pay for a remediator that you both agree on, and get an estimate from them.  And the seller should accept the deal and pay for the remediation.\n\nAs soon as you tell them, if your deal falls apart, they're legally obligated to disclose it to any future buyers.  They won't. They'll remediate it themselves... at about that price... before they go trying to sell it again.  They'll be right back where they were.\n\nPick a remediator you both agree on (or have your agent do it), otherwise they will get the cheapest, and worst remediator available to do the work.  And you don't want that either.\n\nFurthermore, this moment, with nobody living there, and no furniture in it, and a ready pool of cash waiting to fund fixes, is the BEST POSSIBLE time to do the work.  There's still a bunch of time before you take the keys and move it.  Might as well do it now.\n\nIt's not your fault, and you're not \"asking\" for anything.  The house is worth 10 grand less than everybody thought.   It is what it is.  The 10 grand is going to be paid no matter what, and it's going to come out of the seller's pocket, no matter what.",
            "I don't think it's personally fair for the inspector to suggest a price to knock off. \n\nIf an issue like this is found, I typically would recommend having a mold remediation company or three give a quote on the work, then take those quotes to the negotiation table.",

            "I would be very suspicious of an \"inspector\" saying something like that.  Is he shilling for business?  Is the $10K gonna go to him for remediation?  Then, he's not an inspector, he's a contractor fishing for work.",
            "It's all business when it comes to buying a house. Has this one been sitting on the market for over a month and yours is the only offer? Hell yeah. The sellers are committed at this point and don't want to have to list it again. Take advantage of this opportunity to save yourself $10k. But if it's a red hot market and they think they can do better than $10k less than your offer if they re-list, they will balk at this.",

Now (at least where I live) they HAVE TO DISCLOSE, as now they know there is mold. So they legally have to tell anyone else who makes an offer. \n\nBased on where you live, your mileage may vary. But I\u2019d say it\u2019s a strong bargaining position.\n\nEdit: is that gray stuff, all of that gray stuff, mold?  If so, I\u2019d tell them in writing and then run, unless they remove and get it in writing first. No way would I buy into that. Who know where you cannot see it?

Tell the seller you want $10k in credit.  They'll offer you half.  Take it.",
            "There's a lot of new building science going on regarding mold. In cold climates, the winter air doesn't hold enough moisture to dry an attic, and one current recommendation is to put a vapor barrier between the attic structure and the drywall below in an unconditioned attic. Also, insulation like Rockwool which doesn't lose it's value when wet. The source of the water is from the house below, either through air leaks or leaky vents, or both. The attic hatch also needs good air and water vapor sealing.\n\nNow, you could just remediate the mold, but it will come back unless the source of the excess water is removed. You aren't going to get the value of fixing the house correctly, and the buyers may be unable to afford to fix it correctly. All houses of the same age will have the same problem in the same climate.\n\nAs far as the price, I expect $5000 would be on the high side, but not by much, based on a sampling, lab test, remediation, and retest estimate from the east coast I saw in the last week. Splitting that cost would also be another possible approach. \n\nIf it's not a cold climate, there would be different possibilities, such as conditioned attics, and possibly a standalone dehumidifier.",

In a seller's market - which this surely is - buyers have leeway to put in an eye-popping offer knowing they can knock a few pegs off in the inspection.  It really hardly matters what the inspector found, as he will find something; it's just part of the game as it is played by buyers (and mostly buyers' agents, for that matter.)\n\nThere's no switching buyers to avoid this issue; once their inspector finds it and you hear about it, it becomes something that must be disclosed.",

            "Yeah,  that's a problem for your landlord to take care of.  You reasonably expected to rent a lot without any material dangers to your health/ giant bags of poo, and they need to fix that.",

            "Fun sorta related story:\n\n\nMy uncle purchased property to build a pole barn out in rural Wisconsin. He called me one day and asked me to come check something out with him. \n\nFor context, we were both police officers at one time, but neither anymore. \n\nI showed up to find a few black garbage bags, the tops twisted around and tied in knots, with duct tape around them, and mostly buried with rocks. \n\nObviously we were both thinking we had just found a body or some drugs. We decided instead of poking around, we would call the sheriff to have one of them come help. \n\nIt was diapers. Lots and lots of used diapers. But not what you think. There were also multiple empty bottles of lube and tons of hand towels.",
            "Does the toilet work?  Were they emptying the trailer waste into the bags?\n\nI have no idea how to handle it, but I'm sorry you're having to deal with it.",
            "LL is responsible to clean the lot, since you just bought the trailer. Call your agent and start calling the LL everyday.",
            "Better than multiple garbage bags full of chopped up corpses, I guess. \n\n(Sorry, just started watching Dexter on Netflix last night)",

            "\"Just poop in the field.\"\n\n\"No, I have dignity. I will poop in my house in a (stink) pickle bucket and then transfer it to a contractor grade trash bag and then throw it in a field on a moonless night. I'm not an animal.\"",
            "If the land owner told you use the dumpster I'd take advantage of that. If you call anyone you might end up on the hook for the biohazard. I don't know anything about your finances but I'll assume a few thousand for biohazard wasn't in your budget. Ideally the landowner would handle it but they're clearly not.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSo what the fuck do you do? If you want to DIY it keep reading.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nMow or weed eater the grass short so you can see. Wear boots. Not sneakers or sandals, you don't know what's out there, you want coverage. I'd put on long pants and make sure its boots and pants you might not miss if you gotta toss them.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nNext you're going to want gloves. I'd put nitrile on under leather work gloves. The type of mental illness that causes bags of shit is not too far from the type that does drugs. You want protection from biohazard and sharp objects. Should consider long sleeves shirts and if you have any type of eyewear that can double for safety you should grab it. Grab a pair of safety glasses from the local home Depot if you don't have anything. Be it feces or trash you don't want it in your eyes. I know people moan about masks but do you want shit in your mouth or nose? No you don't. Mask up, dab peppermint in it if you're sensitive to smells.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nYou will need contactor bags for clean up, buy more than you think you need. And cat litter if you believe it's liquid style. A shovel, a shovel you won't miss if you toss it. A trash bin to hold the contractor bags. You may not get the odor out so again, don't buy something you'll miss, if you can repurpose something that's better.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nNow that you're geared up, you gotta survey what's out there. Decide a starting point. Half the battle is knowing what you're dealing with. If you got solids line the trash can with a contractor bag and shovel it up. If it's liquid add cat litter and wait a few minutes. You may need to shovel up and dispose of the dirt around the trash bags. Drop it in the contractor bags. Don't over fill the bags. You can double bag them if it's liquid. Toss them in the dumpster like the land owner suggested. Don't let him bitch at you when it smells like a dumpster full of shit.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nIf you can strip off all those clothes at the end before entering the house I'd do it. Put em in a contractor bag, either until you wash em or toss em. Wash hands and shower immediately after.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nI'm not your doctor and not here to lecture but if you're into vaccines you might want to make sure you're up to date on tetanus and hepatitis.\u00a0",
            "First of all, how do you know it's human? Second of all when faced with *multiple* bags half buried in grass why is your instinct to open and investigate them? Thirdly, why? Just why?",

This is a rented lot so all that shit belongs to the owner of the lot.\n\nIf you want to take care of it yourself just wear PPE, cut and dump the bags on the ground.

Wouldn't recommend this as buying cheap totes, putting it in said totes, and dumping it in the dumpster is prolly better. You can reuse the totes while hauling the feces.

There are absolutely guidelines for waste disposal - color coded bags/containers, apparently they just don't regulate the final resting place for your poo. \n\nHowever the CDC and other regulating bodies do have guidelines specifically for handling and disposal of poop - if throwing in regular trash, sealed /double bagged, and use ppe when handling. \n\nOP is free to do what they'd like, but I'd personally err to the side of caution with bodily waste from an unknown source.

It's not an overnight thing, just a series of situations that the person probably couldn't handle mentally or financially and they had to find alternatives.\n\nIt's also extremely difficult to ask for help in the best of times when you're not struggling with depression or living in a hoarders situation.",
