Instead we have rage bait, some dudes podcast, shitty memes and  photos of random trans people. \n\nMany of you leave comments along the lines of \"what's the holup?\" and \"this sub used to be good.\" We feel the same. This subreddit has been kicked from mod to mod for a long time and many have tried and failed to bring it back to what it once was. Which brings us to today: we no longer have enough mods and need a hand moderating. \n\nIf you're interested in ~~cleaning up our mess~~ helping out, here's our [mod app](https://forms.gle/kYDj63fye45uYZbf7) and no, it's not paid.",

I started therapy like a year and a half ago, and I\u2019ve learned tons of stuff about myself, and realized how much I\u2019m affected by things in the past that I don\u2019t even really think about anymore. So my answer is, if you want a true answer to that question, you\u2019ll need to seek therapy, and talk it through with a therapist. A good therapist is great at helping you learn about yourself, and realize your positives and negatives, and how to use them to become a better version of yourself. It\u2019s definitely possible to overcome that addiction without knowing what exactly led to it, but I\u2019m gonna be honest, it would greatly decrease your chances of being successful. I say this out of genuine care, I encourage you to talk to a professional about this. It\u2019s well worth the time, even if you don\u2019t plan on losing any weight, as it helps with much more complicated stuff than just addiction. I believe that a large majority of people would benefit from therapy, like 99% of people, even if they don\u2019t have a specific reason to see a therapist.

            "1. you body has a natural regulation system for rewarding you to eat. otherwise you wouldnt eat. \n2. this regulatory system is evolved to be balanced. two million+ years of human evolution were enough time to make sure you eat when you need and you stop when its detrimental.\n3. BUT that was in times where food wasnt as abundand, carbs (rice, bread, pasta, hyper crossed sweet fruits, sirups, honey, dextrose, fructose, etc.) in everything, werent a thing, at best we had SOME carbs and only seasonal, most must have been meat, fish (both independent of season) and nuts, roots, etc. that were decently storable. \n4. today you also have many flavour enhancing substances that impact your regulatory system and trigger you hunger/ get you addicted. \n5. the food industry heavily propagataed carb-heavy diets and upholds it to this day (it all started with increased production of corn to sell to other countries in times of crisis. once they were out of criss, they had to sell it somewhere else aka inside). government doesent care because otherwise they couldnt feed their population (carbs are cheap), medical industry doesent care, because you become dependent on them (as they only care for your symptomps not  the rootcause of your disease aka. they dont cure your diabetes, they sell you insulin.) \n6. so yeah. we were once all fat-adapt with our diets, now we are sugar-adapt and many of us have genes which cant handle that \"impact on the regulatory system\". you eat food, you eat lots of sugar with that (also drink sugar 24 7 because chances are you dont drink water only as its supposed to be),  now that sugar gets into your blood, your blood sugar increases. high blood sugar is TOXIC for the body, so your body NEEDS to lower it. it releases insulin so that sugar goes from your blood into your cells. what cant get into your cells and isnt used up fast enough, WILL have to be removed otherwise. it will have to be stored as FAT. typically your liver does that. so you get a fatty liver. after that it gets stored in your body (belly, thighs, etc.). the problem is now that you stored that sugar (btw insulin simultaneously promotes fat anabolic processes and h\u00ednhibits fat catabolic processes) and soon after your body finds there is no energy left to use (blood sugar drops) so it MAKES you consume more, it makes you hungry. it could also use the stored fat but it would have to switch metabolism cycles and change regulatory hormones, which is a stress the body only does if it doesent get any sugar for long enough (like 30 min to 2 hours after being hungry or if you exercise the remaining energy away fast enough it feels forced to switch and use up the fat). now you probably are hungry and since food is ubundand, that wont happen, you will drink smth with sugar in it or eat a fruit with sugar in it or eat some other carbs in your main meal, a snack, some sweets, some chips, etc. and it all repeats. you eat more than you need because the body never adapted to carbs being this abundand (only rarely and seasonal, so it lacks regulatory mechanisms for that, same with storing fat, we infinitely store it, which is detrimental but never before was an evolutionary factor). this means your blood sugar will go over the top again, you have to lower it because toxic, you store the sugar as fat, shortly after you are hungry again. sugar IS a drug. it stimulates and triggers insulin. the more you consume, the more insulin you will have to secret, if you do it to regulary, the impact of the insulin will lessen (as with any drug, receptors will increase to get rid of it as well) and you will grow INSULIN RESISTANT. \n\nIMO (i also had weight struggles) KETO+ OMAD+ HIIT + healthy fats (salmon, olive oil for salad, ghee or coconut oil to roast stuff in pan) + whole foods (no processed bullshit) is the way to go. replace KETO with any other low carb diet, same effect. if its inst LOW ENOUGH, you wont becom fat adapt and ONLY become MORE HUNGRY :D. keep that in mind. KETO 6 months now, went from 135 kg to 115 (stagnant atm, because i feel ok and dont wanna go lower on calories; big part of that weight is muscle as well), i got rid of the hunger feeling, feel much more energized and to my biggest suprise (and improvement in living quality) i got rid of my weekly headaches (like 2-3 times a week, now only once in 6 months). being fat adapt ensures a constant blood sugar, low insulin (no spikes), faster switch between fat storage and usage (no fatty liver), etc. can only recommend. watch some youtube videos about it foirst and dont do dirty KETO, if. (dirty meaning you still eat sweet stuff like \"KETO-sweets\" that dont contain sugar but other bullshit that fucks with your regulatory systems). as you mainly eat fat now (for energy), make sure its high quality healthy fat. food industry sells us some INSANELY bad stuff. transfats are VERY harmful substances.",

It takes 5 minutes to drink a milkshake and 2-6 hours to run it off. If that milkshake is one splurge on an otherwise reasonably portioned diet, you're fine. If that's part of your third 1600kcal meal of the day, you're gonna have a bad time.\n\nThe best way to lose weight isn't running, it's reducing caloric intake.",

Always.\n\nIf by training hard we talk about reaching lactic acid saturations levels of pain, then yes. Every training is then about reaching that \u201chard\u201d point.\n\nIts often recommended to work till saturation because it\u2019s a great indicator on when you\u2019ve worked enough the muscle. But this comes at a cost, and it\u2019s unadvised if you have some underlying kidney pathologies. \nSame results fan still be achieved over a longer period, if aging does not interfere...",
            "No?  Studies have shown that just by losing weight you remove yourself from metabolic diseases which are the main drivers for quality of life and lifespan in most developed countries.  Just simply losing weight or bringing it down to a healthy range by just eating less is way more effective than exercising the weight off.  The saying \"you can't outrun a bad diet\" rings true here.\n\nThe main reason people exercise while dieting is just to maintain muscle tissue.  You can look it up that \"extra metabolism boost\" doesn't really account to that many calories, and its been shown working out increases hunger so if you're already on a diet and you work out you get a higher sensation of \"hunger\".  \n\nEven with lifting weights there are limits.  Once your body goes into the 200-220lbs range even if you're very muscular it becomes a downside on your health due to how the human body works, you have a higher chance of developing sleep apnea.\n\nMost research pretty much shows just eating less is easier for most people since it's the path of least resistance.  When they eat less and throw on exercise their \"hunger\" factor increases which sets them up for failure.",

I guess I was defining working/training hard as elevating HR to a target zone, increasing workload of targeted muscle groups, improving quickness/endurance/reaction, these are the types of activities that will naturally burn calories at a rate 2-3x higher than what was being referenced above.  \n\nI followed the TB12 method for a couple years with incredible results which is basically good diet and recovery; but ultimately, it is about pushing yourself hard to improve your health, you just have to do all 3.

I don\u2019t know how accurate it is, particularly if someone does do too much outdoor running for more accurate perceived efforts but at least it\u2019s considered. Unless the watch connect directly to the treadmill then there a good chance the readings are incorrect to start off with (though some watches allow you to re-calibrate you treadmill session distance and hopefully learn over time). On a treadmill, I\u2019ve seen my watch say I\u2019m doing like 2:30min/km pace (which is faster than most people can even sprint) while I was actually probably doing closer to 5:00min/km."
