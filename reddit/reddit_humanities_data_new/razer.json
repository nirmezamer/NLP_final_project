            "I am writing to express my frustration and seek urgent assistance regarding an unresolved RMA issue with my Razer Naga Pro Wireless Mouse. On May 10, 2024, I sent my product for RMA to Acro Engineering Co. here in INDIA and have since received no updates via text or email. Despite multiple calls to their customer care, I have been unable to obtain any satisfactory support or a timeline for resolution.\n\nAfter 18 days, I was informed that the product could not be repaired and that a replacement would be provided due to delays in receiving shipment for Razer Naga Pro Wireless Mouse models in India. However, I have still not received any confirmation on when the replacement will be provided.\n\nFurthermore, I was informed at a later date when I made the call and they received it, that the Razer Naga Pro model has been discontinued, and Acro did not clarify if I would receive a new replacement or any alternative. This lack of communication and clarity has been highly disappointing and has negatively impacted my perception of Razer. Nowadays, Acro is becoming hard to get hold of via calls and text messages.\n\nI am writing to provide an update on the ongoing RMA process for my faulty Razer Naga Pro after 20+ days of struggling.\n\nI requested a replacement with the Razer Naga V2 Pro, but Acro RMA INDIA informed me that it is out of stock. Instead, they are asking me to choose another product (Razer Viper V2) which is below my faulty unit (Razer Naga Pro).\n\nSo I asked for Razer Basilisk v3 Pro and depending on the product I choose as an alternative to their suggestion I have to pay an additional amount of Rs 6000 if I opt for any other option from Razer.\n\nIs this standard procedure for replacing a faulty unit?\n\nAdditionally, I requested the return of my faulty unit (Razer Naga Pro), but they claimed they couldn't do so due to month-end processing.\n\nThis service experience is quite disappointing here in India\u00a0u/minliangtan/, especially given the cost of the product we purchase from Razer. Is this the level of service I should expect after investing so much? This experience is making me reconsider future purchases from Razer.\n\nThis experience has been incredibly frustrating and has caused me significant inconvenience. As a loyal Razer customer, I kindly request your immediate intervention to resolve this matter. Please provide a status update and an estimated timeline for when I can expect to receive my replacement product.\n\nI have always trusted Razer for its quality and customer service, and I hope this issue can be resolved promptly to restore my confidence in your brand. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nArijit Dutta\n\nACRO RMA #: ACRORMA0086964\n\nStreet address: Z-41, Okhla Phase II\n\nCity: New Delhi\n\nState/Province: Delhi\n\nPostal code: 110020\n\nCountry: INDIA\n\nEmail:\u00a0[support@acrorma.com](mailto:support@acrorma.com)\n\nWebsite:\u00a0[www.acrorma.com](http://www.acrorma.com/)\n\nRazer\u00a0\u00a0Razer India",

            "Razer Basilisk V3 Pro - For some reason will not work with dongle on a specific PC after having this mouse for a couple years or so. I plug the dongle into my work laptop and the mouse starts working immediately. I plug it into 4 different ports on my PC and sometimes it works but 99% of the time Windows doesn't make a sound that it has registered that a usb device has been plugged in and a mouse does not show in Razer Synapse (3 or New). I did a complete clean install of Windows 11 Pro 64 bit. This only started to occur after I plugged in a Huntsman V3 Pro but did not fix after I plugged it out and plugged back in my Huntsman V2 Analog. I've installed Razer Synapse 3 and New after doing a clean install on windows, waiting for all the windows updates, and updating all of the Razer stuff, I reset the profile of the mouse, and I still have a dongle that for whatever reason doesn't want to get recognized. The device is 100% battery and turned on to dongle mode.\n\nWhen I was using my old copy of WIndows 11 where the issue started happening, the keyboard + mouse would stop working for no reason, only during a game I think (it only happened twice), the keyboard would sometimes start up but the mouse would need to be plugged in. I was able to get the dongle recognized a couple times after a lot of re-putting in the USB dongle into random ports but removing it and putting it back in sometimes would just stop it from working. I deleted and uninstalled drivers and everything to no avail. The fact that I did a clean Windows install should make it so I don't have any corrupt or old drivers or anything anyways. This mouse is not recognized within my BIOS either and it's all for my one computer, the second I plug it into my work laptop, it works perfectly.\n\nedit: okay well me pulling the dongle in and out of usb ports to troubleshoot the issue snapped the housing. I was able to extract the housing out and put it back on the bare usb but now I'm pretty sure it's broken, no longer recognized by any of my devices now.",

My mouse button assignments got reset, and as I try to set everything back up, some buttons no longer work properly according to my assignments.\n\nHorizontal tilt left and right scroll clicks no longer working properly without synapse open, and resetting/updating/reinstalling the device, driver, and Synapse doesn't work. Tried with another laptop and same issue persists.\n\nTo be clear, the button itself still works, and still works properly with Synapse open, but somehow reverts to a previous button assignment after I exit Synapse, e.g. I set tilt left to be \"A\" then set it back to \"repeat scroll left\". When synapse is open, tilting left works properly, but when closed, it reverts back to \"A\" instead of scrolling left. no amount of resetting the button or profile reverts tilt left to \"repeat scroll left\", and will still type \"A\" without Synapse open.

On my PC I always used it via dongle bluetooth (pretty sure its the only way to use them on PC) and on PS5 I connect them via cable to the PS5 controller. Yesterday when I stopped playing on the PS5 and disconnected the cable from the controller, the headset just didnt connect to my pc again, which it always did before. It has the blue LED that supposedly indicates that the headset is paired, but no sound comes in, and the razer app also doesnt recognize them as paired. Im pretty sure the dongle is fine since my PC recognizes it as a bluetooth device when I plug it, and discord sometimes (only sometimes, its weird) recognizes it as well when I unplug and plug it again with that \"do you want to change audio device?\" pop up.\n\nIve tried googling the problem but no luck so far. Ive tried updating firmware, but all firmware seems to be up tondate, also restarting my pc and removing the dongle from the bluetooth devices page on windows settings.",

Interestingly, 980 pro has a Linux partition that I use to dual boot and the original one has just the windows. Original drive at 99% health and 980 pro at 100%. Linux works fine, no issues/kernel panics/errors. Windows is the culprit. \n\n\nAfter multiple resets, recovery, fresh windows media installs and the fact that Linux runs fine I leaned towards hardware failures. To isolate it I tried changing ram sticks, switching slots for both ram and ssd.\nI just purchased an ssd to test the bad drive theory out and so far it\u2019s fine. \n\n\nWhat do I do? It\u2019s just a month over warranty and I did not anticipate having ssd issues especially on such an expensive machine. I haven\u2019t contacted any support yet. I purchased it with a Mastercard so it MAY have that extended warranty benefit. I know Samsung has a five year warranty for some ssds and I think it may apply to this but not sure since it was shipped with the laptop.

            "Hi u/No-Conversation-5833,\n\nGaming systems run hotter than other laptops due to their performance and power requirements. It is safe for newer processors to run warmer than older processors due to additional innovations from AMD and Intel that allow more performance with higher power draw and thermals. Check AMD Ryzen\u2122 or Intel Core, and select the CPU processor of your Razer Blade to identify its maximum CPU operating temperature.\n\nIf you ever experience the issues below that might be due to high temps, please contact us via PM including the link to this post for reference so we can help you further.\n\n  \n- Excessive fan noise or use\n\n- Games stop responding\n- Windows stops responding\n- Razer Blade restarts or turns off unexpectedly\n- Hgh temperatures exceeding 90 \u00b0C or 194 \u00b0F for an extended period of time without performing intensive tasks\n\n  \nAll the best,\n\nTine C.\n\nR\u039bZ\u039eR | L\u00fanaCancr\u00ed",

        "content": "I've recently ditched another popular mice brand for Razer. I'm a wired mouse extremist. I don't want no dongle, no battery to charge, nothing. So I've purchased the Deathadder V3. Fantastic mouse : back to basics, no crappy RGB (another thing I'm becoming more and more extremist about), subdued design, super light, solid, fantastic switches, sensor and firm scrollwheel... It's almost reached perfection... ALMOST !  \n  \nBecause, well, it's a Deathadder and not a Viper and while I have large hands and it fits very well, I do have a preference for tinier fingertip designs and I was very disappointed in Razer that no \"Viper V3\" (non-pro, non-hyperspeed, non-nothing) exists.  \n  \nI hope it's something Razer has planned because I can't believe there aren't other people like me who just prefer good old wired everything on their top end hardware. The pricetag of wireless mice compared to wired alone to me justifies buying wired. The Deathadder V3 is almost a steal in that regard.",

Razer Blade batteries are very simple to remove, only requiring a few T5 screws for the back panel. Batteries have a shelf-life and degrade with use, heat and charge stress can speed this up and usually need replacing around 3-5 years for laptops. 2022+ Blades have a charge limiter that should be enabled.\n\nFor replacements, contact Razer support first, battery warranty is 2 years and outside of warranty they can sell to some regions. eBay and iFixit also have replacements, check your model and year.\n\n[SpicyPillow FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/spicypillows/comments/gebotv/faq_what_to_do_if_you_have_a_swollen_battery/)\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "Yeah at first I didn't realize how new the Viper V3 series is. \"Bad\" purchase timing on my part ;)  \n  \nI strongly hope they add a wired top end Viper. If it's priced similarly to the Deathadder (no reason not to be) I'd probably consider buying it. Keeping both mice for a big 1v1 comparison and eventually selling the loser.\n\nI've quit team \"G\" after so many mice/keyboards since in my eyes the build quality went down and the price to perf ratio and also the design language didn't speak to me anymore. I'm glad to see Razer coming up with such clean no-nonsense mice. Here's me hoping they take notice :)"
