Not debating really whether or not thats a good change on this specific difficulty, I dont think it matters much one way or another - by every metric, it is trivial! But is it a case that they made such changes which then rolled out up through the difficulties?\n\nThe result is, thanks to the extra spawn count from breaches, that whether the patrols have been trimmed or not seems to be lost in the fact that you spend more time fighting whats in front of you. And I dont personally find it fun to default to the 'just run away' mantra. I avoid things that dont need to be fought already, I would however like to be able to kill the stuff thats on top of the objective, because fun fact, **killing things is fun!**!\n\nIt just makes no sense. There were a number of buffs in that patch, so why then am I finding the game as hard on a level below what I was typically playing last week?\n\nI dont want to impede on those who enjoy more chaos either.

Sure you might be able to take a hit more but you can't outrun shit and you can't stand your ground.\n\nDon't just make light, medium and heavy armor. Make it specialized. By that I mean a medic armor can keep +2-4 stims but boosts dmg, fire rate and stuff as well.\nBerserker armor let's you stand your ground where you kill all the enemies around you and you survive with 1hp to fight another day. Just stuff like that. Would make armor so much more interesting and meaningful.\n\nWhy do missions have to take such a long time? Exterminate mission was good as it was. Just make it somewhat rarer to appear. It was such a nice treat to finish a mission in like 5 min tops.\n\nCheck the ego. I don't understand why some devs get mad at the player base when some people cry for nerfs or whatever. Charger is too common to be that tanky and that hard to kill. Because by the time you kill one there's two ninja bike titans on your ass and you're done for.\n\nGive us the flag.

It\u2019s forcing players to play the way the developers want the game to be played, robbing the player of choice, and agency, and that\u2019s \u201canti-fun\u201d.\n\nDevs stating that they want primary weapons to be awful, and to rely on stratagems\u2026 but stratagems have a long cool down so can\u2019t be used regularly, there\u2019s environmental debuffs, there\u2019s map debuffs, and are very underwhelming, as well as being nerfed.\n\nStratagems should be a supplement to your Arsenal, not the main way to take down enemies.\n\nCalling the only viable stratagems \u201ccrutches\u201d. Balancing done via watching YouTube videos, or data, not how the game feels to play or how the game experience is not really understanding how the game plays. \n\nSo the main point of the battle pass is to unlock guns\u2026 but devs, in charge of balancing, have said that main weapons should feel dreadful\u2026 that\u2019s bad game design. What\u2019s the point of unlocking stuff via battle pass if it\u2019s not meant to be any good? You\u2019ve taken away the point of the grind\u2026\n\nBreaking stuff via a patch without fully testing; The devs need a proper Public Test Realm before implementing anything. Breaking UI elements, breaking spawns, breaking the environment where objects fall through the ground, crashes on both platforms, not being able to rejoin when you\u2019re kicked out via a crash. \n\nThe patches being pushed live are breaking unintended things that then later need to be patched. That\u2019s bad software design, and implementation in industry, and not best practice. \n\nHow is nobody feeding back that the game is a worse experience before you\u2019re expecting players to play? \n\nIntroducing weather effects, without fully testing, and making it so you can\u2019t dodge it\u2026 that\u2019s not challenging game design. It\u2019s funny the first time, but after that, it becomes just disincentive to play.\n\nArmour straight up not working properly so that you have to take the shield, and then nerfing the shield. The shield was because the armour wasn\u2019t working, it\u2019s a solution to problem you created. \n\nThe game needs a clear vision, and rather than just adding stuff, balance what\u2019s there, and build on top of solid foundations. The game has become less about skill, and purely all about luck. It\u2019s really unfun to play. \n\nFrom playing the patch for two hours the other day, it was very clear there was a problem, yet did no devs, or testers say it was borked? Did you or do you even play your own game?\n\nMy friends went from playing every night multiple hours, to we are talking about what to play next. We\u2019re ready to move on.

            "After playing to level 140+, I can see why nobody wants to play HD2 anymore. The game is not fun; firstly, the maps are poorly designed for defense planets, the bots are literally cheating, and the nerfs are actually detrimental to the game.\n\nMaps\n\n* **The Eradicate maps are too small**; they leave no room to run and reposition, and at Helldive 9 the enemy spawns completely saturate the map. To keep this level of difficulty and spawn, the map should be enlarged by 2-3 times in diameter to give players a chance to reload and resupply\n* **Retrieve essential personnel (REP) should not arbitrarily spawn enemies right on the border** of this huge map. The bigger brother mission, emergency evacuation (EE), spawns only patrols and normal bugholes, giving breathing room that REP does not. REP should be EE minus the side and secondary objectives for being 15 minutes rather than 40\n\nBots\n\n* **Bots should not have the ability to shoot through walls.** I understand that they are supposed to lay down suppressive fire, but there lacks a check if the bots can see you or if their gun is jammed through terrain. The game should check if the enemy can actually see the player before accurately shooting towards our direction, and otherwise cease fire after breaking contact for 10 seconds or if the gun is physically jammed inside a wall.\n* **Bots should not have infinite rockets.** Plain and simple\n* **Evacuate High Value Assets is bugged and should be temporarily disabled.** Mode is bugged with how bots interact with the map and this mission type should be disabled until a resolution is found. Right now factories spawn inside or clips through the mountain and can 1-2 shot the objectives to instantly fail the mission. The dead bodies of tanks and hulks obstruct the 1 pathway making it impossible to return fire halfway into the mission using guns on helldive 9\n\nEnemy reinforce\n\n* **Enemies should not be allowed to call in reinforce arbitrarily without seeing you or without a head.** Right now it's on a cooldown system, but there's no point in killing an enemy calling reinforcements because doing so doesn't reset the cooldown and the immediate neighbor will call it despite not having line of sight to seeing you. If the bug is headless, it can't call a bug breach.\n\nWeapons\n\n* **Our weapons should be impactful**, we should not rely on support weapons because we lose them on death but right now all guns are awful not by design but because of a tone deaf balance team. Weapons need to be fixed, and nearly all spawin-in weapons need to be moved to medium armor penetration except for bird shot shotguns, low cal smgs, low cal pistols.\n* **Hellpod space optimization needs to be moved to a ship module upgrade.** This thing is literally mandatory on all missions because it doubles a skilled player's survival time and their performance. And with how poorly spawn-in weapons perform, we need all the help we can get.\n* **The nerfs.** No recommendation here, just wanted to note that everyone I knew who quit the game told me they did so because the game kept nerfing things in a PVE game when the game was perfectly fine at launch. I don't know who leadership at AH balancing is but if HD2 dies in the near future, just know it was this that killed the game the hardest.\n\nStrategems\n\n* **Negative effects should be tied to the map's side objectives.** Let us equip the 4th strategem but have it disabled until the AA is taken out like the game implied. Fix the minimap when the spore towers are destroyed.",

Bringing the viable guns down, especially in a pve game, pretty much always just tightens the meta even further around the next most viable options rather than opening up build diversity and frankly it just feels like shit to play. People talk about how the game should be hard because we\u2019re supposed to be shit-eating line infantry, but imo that\u2019s such a stupid fucking line of thinking. First, that logic falls apart considering you\u2019re literally a squad of 4 sent in to literally knock on the gates of hell and singlehandedly take down unholy abominations even if it is all just technically a small part in a huge operation. Also, if you want to make the game hard, give me harder challenges while still allowing me to feel powerful rather than feeling like a peashooter up against middling challenges.\n\nI REALLY dislike hidden stats bullshit. I\u2019m a relatively casual player these days as I just don\u2019t have as much time on my hands, so give me the information I need to make the most informed decision for myself. [This tweet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/s/HgOgGDvpW2) is fucking mind boggling to me. Why the fuck would you BRAG about hiding away stats and information from your players and taking away player agency by \u201cnot painting the complete picture\u201d? Like I said, I\u2019m a relatively casual console player these days compared to my previous years of grinding it out on my gaming PC. I\u2019m not gonna read through all the data-mined bullshit and make a spreadsheet of what information you guys drip feed us just to figure out what loadout to take. I\u2019ll just play a different game that respects my time better. Literally just do the armored core 6 thing where the most relevant stats are shown initially, but you can press a button to reveal all the nitty gritty details.\n\nFinally, this community fucking sucks (frankly like 99% of online gaming communities are the same, which is why I\u2019ve largely pulled away from that shit). People bring up valid criticisms and concerns and people reeeeeeee like it\u2019s an affront to their existence. I know it\u2019s an insanely hard concept to understand, but you can enjoy the game without dick-riding it. Am I an entitled gamer? You\u2019re damn right I am. We\u2019re literally all paying customers, why the fuck should you not feel entitled to offer valid criticism and voice concerns about a live service product you spent money on? I swear to god it\u2019s like these people enjoy being in an abusive relationship (not that Arrowhead has done anything heinous so far, just that vibe that they can do no wrong is nauseatingly pervasive here).

As it turns out, it also punishes many friend groups that play (which don't have the people to fit into groups of 4) and it makes Quickplay much harder due to a bug that pretends empty player slots are filled when a 'Diver leaves a mission.  Whoopsie-daisies, I guess...\n\nBut why...WHY...were the Stalkers buffed???  Fixing the Stalker silhouettes in fog is fine, but they're now much harder to see and CAN ATTACK WHILE CLOAKED.

            "I don't want to hear anymore gaslighting from Arrowhead that things should be okay with the enemy consistency. They very clearly aren't. Before the patrol changes of the first patch that altered them I could solo helldive with a lot of stealth and effort. But this? What the hell is this? Three of these chargers came from ONE patrol. There are four of them visible that are alive. There is a fifth one alive down in the crater behind these four and a SIXTH lays dead somewhere in there and a seventh off to the left keeled over. There is also a dead bile titan out of frame somewhere to the left as well.\n\nThis is the beginning of the fucking mission, a single objective hasn't even been completed yet. From the moment I landed, I already had multiple patrols converging on my location according to my radar, and then came the first breach. There was no escaping the fight because the patrols just keep spawning, and it's nearly impossible to break line of sight with the hunters being spammed even more than before, not to mention the chargers with their ridiculously tight turn radius keeping up with you.\n\nJust revert the patrols like you said you would back in May Arrowhead. No \"tweaking.\" Just do what you said you were going to do. The game is in so much worse off a place than it was even during patch 01.000.200. And before some smart ass tries to say \"It's helldive,\" I experience this same sort of BS even on difficulties 6, 7, and 8. Just leave well enough alone and stop trying to fix and alter what isn't broken. The patrols and spawning system was fine as it was in February and March. The heavy enemy spawn balance still wasn't perfect but it was better than this. The hordes of light enemies can be fine but we do not have the ammo economy to deal with it, especially if you run solo.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qe81qdpryh7d1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9b66fc2527d75d67bc0608ab7ab79b9e21506ce\n\nI'm not even going to going into the flame tornadoes much. Arrowhead's \"fix\" for those? They don't follow the player as closely but they still stay in your area and circle around where you're fighting. These things should be randomly wandering the map, but still they remain close to the player and swarm around you and your objectives.\n\nI used to love this game but they just keep making it worse with EVERY patch.

            "The game isn't fully here and we're getting balance patches. This scares me, not because what was patched or what was changed, but because it's made it more apparent that the devs want to balance the game ***as is.***  \n\n\nI don't know how everyone else feels, but I don't want the game to be balanced around Hunters being able to head shot you, or Bile Spewers being able to instakill you without even touching you, or Scavenger spitters or Titans slowing you when they obviously didn't hit you. Not even to mention that Heavy Devastators shoot through their own shields or Hulks and dropships sliding onto the ground from 45m away. What are these balance changes addressing when we don't even have access to all the weapons? Heavy armor is still dogshite because it doesn't give you enough to justify using, in fact it makes you get hit MORE because those bullshit hits happen even more.  \n\n\nI can't understand the most is how the devs were saying they want Stratagems to be what you use, and then nerf two of the most popular Stratagems because those stratagems fill the niche that's not available currently in the game. You don't have access to good, hard hitting weapons outside of autocannon and recoiless rifle. The reason why those were not used was because people NEEDED the shield to not get CCed for stopping for more than a couple seconds to reload. What was the balance patch for? Who benefits from it? What does it address? From the perspective of the design philosophy from what the dev wrote, the entire thing being that they want players to use their Stratagems to overcome challenges when we don't even have all the stratagems yet. Am I taking crazy pills or is everyone putting on their pants before they even put on underwear?   \n\n\nGame is going through the same shit every great shooter went through, where they catch lightning in a bottle and don't know what the hell to do with it because they're too focused on pushing an idea of what's fun instead of leaning into what's fun. Fun is not ragdolling across the ground as you narrate your own death for 5 minutes. Fun is not waiting for your Stratagem to come off cooldown when you miss because of the Stratagem modifier that makes the accuracy worse. Fun is ***not*** being told that what you enjoy is \"too good\" when there's just not that much variety.   \n\n\nGet rid of Negative Stratagem Modifiers. If you want people to use them, give modifiers that buff specific types.  \n   \nGuns Ready: \"All Orbital Stratagems come in faster\"  \nAir Superiority: \"All Eagles fly by twice, dropping payloads twice\"  \nOvertime in R&D: \"All sentries drop in little stacks with two guns but the same ammo.\"  \nThe Best kind of Support: \"All support weapons drop with you when your pod lands.\"  \n\n\nLeave the Stratagem modifiers positive from planet side and negative from IN MISSION so that way you have a reason to go to the optional instead of getting a randomizer and throwing your shield backpack or EATs into three tanks. From the beginning of the game it feels like you're just buying back the power you SHOULD have with ship upgrades and Stratagems, because those all feel balanced around already having them. Are we really going to make it worse by balancing Stratagems, weapons, and everything else around a playstyle devs think is brainless?  \nHonestly, I would like to see the shield just removed. It's the least thought about Stratagem and is just directly inferior to the shield generator. Give the shield pack as a passive to heavy armor so that way it feels relevant. Either to specific types of Heavy Armor or just stack it as a second passive for having to have less speed and stamina regen when those are two things that are needed in EVERY mission right now. If you stop moving, you just die.",

We had fun. It was though but we had fun. The latest huge nerfs on everything that worked \u201cbetter\u201d than the rest took that fun away to me. \n\nI am also confused about that \u201carmor fix\u201d as we die more easily than we used to even with stronger armor. I tried all sizes, the whole range of them and barely notice a difference in resistance\u2026 if any. \n\nI thought maybe this balancing was to make sure the Mech are useful but not even.

That said, there is no end game in that Requisition slips are meaningless after level ~35, and Exp is worthless past level 50.\n\nAdditionally, the primary gun balance in this game is abysmal. Every time I try a new primary weapon I just think \"why am I not using the breaker?\" When I introduce my friends to the game, I think they are a little deflated by how little variety there is in actually **viable** primary weapons. \n\nFact of the matter is, besides the Breaker, none of the primaries even have the *raw DPS* to kill the larger unarmored enemies. Putting 2 SMG mags into a Brood Commander, and watch it still crawl around, feels **awful**. \n\nThis leads to the larger issue of enemy health and expectations. Some enemies feel like their health is terribly over tuned for how they act and appear. I am mainly talking about **Bile Spewers**. These huge, bulbous bugs that looks like they are just going to pop when you shoot at them. \nOne would think so, but they actually have an absurd amount of health. Also, despite literally dragging their body on the ground, they are masters of stealth. They make hardly any noise until they begin casting their no-cooldown, one-shot spit attack.\n\nEven my precious Breaker typically takes a full mag in their unarmored body parts to kill it. Pray someone on your team brought the Autocannon or Railgun, because the game will spawn upwards of 10 of these things at a time on certain Ops.\n\nFinally, the game should show you the enemy types on the map before dropping in. I'm not talking about showing Shriekers or Stalker Nests. I'd like to know if the mission is going to have loads of Hunters, fewer Titans, more Chargers etc. so we can come prepared. Ultimately though, I need to know if there will be Bile Spewers. I would approach any mission with them much differently, as currently, these bugs require special attention to avoid becoming overwhelmed at higher difficulties. \n\nI could write another 2k words about Bile Spewers and the problems associated with them given the current state of weapon/stratagem balance, especially on Helldive. But I'd like to mention the Bots.\n\nIt is unclear whether Bots are overtuned or Bugs are undertuned. Regardless Bot Ops are significantly more difficult than Bug ops. There is no congruency in the difficulty. Level 5 Bots feels as difficult as level 7 or 8 Bugs. This is a multifaceted problem, so much so I can't even try to give suggestions on how to fix it. \n\nHelldivers is a brilliant game, likely with a bright future, and I have really enjoyed playing. All I know is that after well over a hundred hours of gameplay in a short time, these are the game's pain points for me.\n\n#**TLDR**: No end-game progression, exp/req slips are useless. Lackluster variety in primary weapon choice. Fuck Bile Spewers. Enemy types should be shown during mission prep. Large disparity between Bot and Bug difficulties.",
            "Every patch has ruined the game more and more, as much fun as the mech is, I would give up all of it for the friends list to work again, for it not to reset my loadout to default. Every patch I get excited only to see they don\u2019t patch out the most game breaking bugs",
            "What niche does the Railgun fill now?  It can kill Brood Commanders...but so can the new energy primary...Its very awkward against chargers, and very inefficent against Bile Titans.  Imo with the buffs to EATs and RR, can we get the Railgun unnerfed?  There are other options now.",
            "RANT\n\nI think what I've concluded is that they designed the enemies and.armor system to be too realistic. It's not fun to mag dump into an enemy's face and do 0 damage just because that small bit is completely invulnerable (somehow) to my advanced ballistic and laser weaponry.\n\nIf these bugs have such thick fucking hides, and our advanced space armor is as strong as wet toilet paper, why the fuck aren't we kitting ourselves in bile titan and charger skin? It makes no sense.\n\nIf they want to encourage certain play styles and tactics, they should make the hit boxes simply register damage differently per weapon and body part, but NEVER let a weapon do 0 damage. Ever.\n\nIf a standard bullet does, say, 10 damage per shot against an enemy's bare hide, cool. When it's armored, make it reduce that damage to 7-8. When ammo type changes, make it change the base damage number and then also apply the armor-based alteration.\n\nDon't just make bullets bounce off enemies. Or at least so many of them. It literally feels like there's too many armor levels and armor piercing types so as to make any 4 man squad completely incapable of ever being kitted to properly handle every enemy.\n\nCool, ONE GUY has the right random gun to kill an enemy type. But when everyone else is fucking struggling, it feels bad to play moment to moment.\n\nI don't mind hard games. I've played my fair share of From titles and rogue likes. Grinding and difficulty isn't so hugely off-putting to me. But distinctly unfun design and needlessly complex mechanics sure as shit are.",

But like, why is it that I'm searching for ONE usable weapon to fight bots?\n\nStriders feel horrible because 90% of primarys can't hurt them and antitank feels wasted on them. Even eating two autocannon rounds feels bad. Taking an anti-medium support like GL makes striders easy but makes you unable to handle hulks, tanks, or walkers. \n\nThere are too many heavies to not be carrying anti-tank, which means whatever primary you are carrying needs to be able to handle striders, which they can't.

It's fine for a unified group, but it's stupid for a bunch of randoms. Bot damage needs to have range based damage falloff. I am fine with rockets one-tapping me but they should travel just a hair slower and rocket devastators ABSOLUTELY NEED to have their fire rate reduced.

Either way, stealth is no longer viable.  \n\n2. Patrols spawn WAY more for solo than documented.  I have heard the patrol spawn music kick in as I'm evading or disposing of another patrol. The numbers of enemies in patrols also has severely increased to the point where I can't kill enough of them to prevent a reinforcement call-in.  This is another nerf to stealth gameplay.  \n\n3. Berserkers are high-key the most bullshit medium automaton unit in the game.  Devastators looks like tanks but go down in two AMR hits like chumps.  Berserkers look like they should be made of lace but they are definitely tankier than Devastators because they take at least 3 AMR hits and *still* keep coming. Your only option is to run away and get enough space to shoot them, but they also have this weird wobble to their run that makes it damnably impossible to land shots.  Why are they tougher to kill than Devastators?  \n\n4.

Might as well just play orbital bombardment simulator, from orbit.  I'm playing a shooter to shoot.  If the balance team is determined to make shooting the least optimal way to deal with enemies, why bother dropping?",

I'm unaware if this bug also occurs with bugs carcasses as I fund the Saudi's oil market. I can't even dive away from gunfire half of the time because I'll dive into an itty-bitty crevice OR a limb/torso that my character will get stuck in like I'm stepsis in the washing machine. \n\n  \nPlease lengthen the cooldown between firing on rocket/shield devastators. If there is any combination of these in a group chances are you're getting dropped if you dont have stims or a support weapon to assist. I don't care about the accuracy, let them rival us. It is FRUSTRATING not being able to get a shot off WHEN IM BEHIND COVER due to the blast from rockets knocking me out of cover, and that's where the shield devastators clean up shop. Its also near impossible to actually kill a group of these, as you need to dodge rockets & minigun fire; All of those things stunlock the HELL out of you to the point you're on the ground (ass up like stepsis) or just shooting into the sky. \n\nThe 500kg is ass. Absolute ass. \n\nI get that the game isn't supposed to be easy, but playing this game is getting frustrating. I almost play exclusively on Helldiver, the fact testing isn't even done on this difficulty means developers and GOOD players are on two different games. We shouldn't HAVE to bring certain gear with us for EVERY mission in order to get through it, i.e. stun grenades, pummeler+shield, shield gen bkpk. \n\n  \n181 hours, level 75.

            "I'm honestly pretty concerned about the state of the community as a result of the moderation in the Discord. I was banned from it during the \"forced account link\" debacle for making a relatively mild comment about something one of the CMs had a habit of doing. It was very sudden, and there was no prior indication that I had broken a rule. I kind of suspected this had happened to more people than just me, and in the following months, I've been proven right. A lot of people have been banned. Some are very understandable. However, many were immediately banned for mild offenses, and some for reasons they don't even know.\n\nI think one reason for this is that certain mods are unlikely to take any moderative action milder than a permanent ban. This absence of a \"less lethal,\" to me, feels like there is a line between unacceptable and acceptable behavior, but nobody in the server really knows where it is except whatever moderator is looking at the screen. That's understandable if there are measures between doing nothing and outright banning someone. For some moderators, there aren't.\n\nI don't think it's the entire moderation team. I think some, if not most of them are sensible people in a difficult situation, moderating a massive server. But this is a problem regardless.\n\nOn an older post in this subreddit, there is a screenshot of one moderator saying \"man watching u all cry amuses me so much\". I don't know what the context was, but I don't think it matters. I think that mod did get in trouble for this.\n\nMy problem is that comments like this have set a different standard for behavior than what they expect from the player. This causes ambiguity in what is allowed. Combined with the lack of any \"less lethal\" moderative action, an environment is created in which moderators can realistically do or say whatever they want, but the player has to walk on eggshells to stay in the Discord community at all. It would go a long way to question moderators about every person they ban. This might encourage them to take other actions instead. It seems they are already addressing the way they talk to the players.\n\nI did go ahead and fill out the appeal form, though it was difficult to find and I'm still not 100% sure if it was legit or not, because you can really only find it in random replies here. It doesn't really acknowledge the possibility you might have been treated unfairly.\n\nAll I'm really asking for is better accountability for not only what moderators say, but the actions they take. Some of them have very alarming mindsets about the people they have power over. I don't think anyone should be fired, I love that they have the opportunity to learn and change the way they approach moderating. I'm just asking that steps be taken to give players the same opportunity to learn and change.\n\nFor full clarity, my comment was \"\\[staff member\\] throwing fuel on a dumpster fire? unheard of /s\". I will freely admit it was immature of me to say this. I was attempting to make relatively lighthearted joke about something that was commonly known, though perhaps during a bad time. You can decide for yourself whether or not this warranted a ban. I don't think it did.\n\nThe experience has left such a sour taste in my mouth that I haven't really picked up HD2 since. It honestly hurts to be tossed out for this, especially considering how central the official Discord is to the active community. I do love this game, and I want to see it succeed. But as it stands now, it has been made abundantly clear that I am not welcome.",

Even running doesn't seem to be much of an option because I immediately get hit by a swarm of hunters that slow me down enough to keep me from getting away. I'm really hoping the upcoming spawn fix rectifies the issue, otherwise I don't see myself playing the game mutch in the future.",
            "*sigh* il be honest guys. I think I'm done with the game for awhile after this last patch. Mechs are fun and cool and all, weapon balances weren't bad (except the railgun, that shit is good and truly worthless now) but the enemy AI and aggression now is bordering ridiculous.\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I am playing with a full 4 man squad on coms planning out are strategems and routes, and we get absolutely swarmed with enemies as soon as we drop. Both the bots and the bugs ads can actually outrun you even with light armor and full stamina. (Hunters slowdown mechanic is absolutely abysmal when you have 10 or more constantly stun locking you into the ground... LITERALLY...like I get glitched into the floor from how many are beating my corpse half the time) And the amount of heavy enemies that now spawn just cannot be reasonably dealt with. Ppl here have shown videos of 8-10 bile titans chasing them, or 4 tanks and 3 hulks dropping on their location.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I'm all for a little extra challenge, especially with so many weapon buffs, despite the railgun nerf, I think it's fun to experiment with more viable weapons like the flamethrower and laser. But good fucking lord devs, I'd like to be able to use these weapons without Eren Jaeger calling in the fucking rumbling on me when I have to turn this stupid radar dish. My squad mates would like to be able hold off an enemy breach and catch our breaths and resupply before the next horde attacks us.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Difficulty 7 and up I know are meant to be endgame content for us, so I understand having them require more from us, but even in a full 4 man team, all of us just struggle to stay alive more than complete objectives. There's no more dopamine hits for having completed missions optimally, it just feels like work now. My teammates are exhausted and want to go to bed after just 1 mission now, let alone finishing a campaign for the medals. having recently unlocked all the current upgrades for ships and strategems, I don't even want to trying finishing the war bonds anymore. This game ISNT FUN ANYMORE. It's tedious and annoying now, and the rush from playing a hilarious PvE co-op shooter with my friends is gone now. We all agreed to stop playing for awhile because it really is just too difficult for us to enjoy ourselves anymore without it become a sweatfest.\u00a0",

Yet it did not ruin overall co-op design BioWare went for, BW devs were not only not upset but openly praised how good these players are and so did the community. \n\nAll the while core of co-op remained intact, most people still played cooperatively, even solo players still played mainly with others.\n\nI myself will never do 7-9 solo, even if pre-patch balance stayed. Same how I didn't do Platinum ME3 solo, while it took until later DLCs to get two highly survivable characters( Geth Juggernaut and EDI-like bot) to do Gold solo.\n\nThe first month of HD2 reminded me a lot about ME3 Co-Op, well paced and challenging fun. BioWare never screwed up an update for Co-Op. Sure, there were some bugs introduced, questionable balance changes and weak DLC characters, but the overall game feel remained fun and challenging every time.\n\nArrowhead fucked it by first month and devs statements do not make it sound it was unintentional change in difficulty spike.

            "First off, running away being the meta at high levels is shit game design and unfun. I don't care if that's the original vision, it should not make up the bulk of the gameplay. There are other ways to make the game more difficult at higher levels without making it a slog to get through; it's also not some kind of mastery to run in circles over actual positioning for fuck's sake. For example, being on the high ground should make it more difficult to get swarmed or blasted, rather than making zero difference or still allowing you to get fucking blasted. You should be able to hold positions to a reasonable degree, and even fortify them to your advantage.\n\nSecondly, eradication mission maps need to get fucking fixed, because they are absolutely impossible on bot planets. The nerf was completely unnecessary--increasing difficulty does not mean make the missions literally unbeatable. The bots should only be able to funnel in from specific areas, and they shouldn't spawn INSIDE the fucking base, especially if you're doubling the amount necessary to complete a mission and upping spawn rates/elite counts. Give us the damn verticality back and a reasonable ability to hold our positions.\n\nThirdly, if you're going to shill stealth as the main strategy to accomplish objectives in this game, then don't fucking nerf stealth to the point of being doomed after 1 engagement or mistake. Breaking line of sight should mean something, destroying bases and side objectives should make an impact, and you should be able to prevent drop ships being called in or remove the ability for infinite dropships/breaches to be called. Enemies should not be able to chase you across the fucking map or snipe you from an unreasonable distance and crit your head out of nowhere.",

            "200+ hours. Only playing diff 7+. Mainly diff 9 on borgs.\n\nAt this point I don't think AH knows what they're doing, at all. They are playing every bad card possible with every update and It's shocking to see. No lessons are being learned.\n\nWhen the game came out, my group could get up to 16 players playing at the same time. Now, I'm the only one, and I feel more like I play out of obligation than genuine fun. There's one thing in common between all my friends who played the game, frustration.\n\nAH expects us to collaborate on orders, but don't respect our intelligence enough to show the hidden stats of galactic war. You have to access third party sites to see supply lines and proper data. Something I'd expect out of star citizen, not a casual shooter. They made a horde shooter that punished you for fighting hordes. All primaries get nerfed and buffs often don't make enough impact to matter. I can count weapons that updates later improved on one hand.\n\nDisplayed weapon stats in the armory or often misleading or sometimes even straight up lies. There are hidden stats to many weapons which for no good reasons, we're not allowed to see (unless you use third party sites, something you shouldn't have to do). They say it's to make it \"easier\", but I don't see how hiding information could help a player make better informed decisions.\n\nBesides illuminates, there seem to be little to no major updates planned or even conceptualised. It seems like for majority of the game's remaining lifespan, most we'll get is warbond updates, until even those run out. I'm also worried about how the illuminate drop will be handled. In HD1 they were the least fun enemy to fight. If they're delivered poorly in HD2, NO ONE will want to play against them. It'll be the borg problem but 10 times worse.\n\nWarbonds themselves are all over with their theme. Why is the warbond titled after lasers only featuring Tesla armor and 2 laser weapons? Why does the Polar combat warbond feature fire/concussive weapons? The only one that makes sense to me is the Explosive one, cuz everything fits it's theme. Whats next? Stealth weapons in a Pyrotechnic warbond? Put fire weapons in a fire warbond, stealth in stealth, ect. I know this is done to essentialy force you to buy more warbonds if you want to follow a particular theme (full fire loadout is split between 3 warbonds, btw.). Makes sense from business standpoint but it's still fucking stupid.\n\nI enjoy(ed) the core gameplay loop but at this point, I see no light in the tunnel. It feels like the game will only get progressively worse. It's been nothing but one step forward, two steps back since launch.\n\nEnemy spawn rates have also been \"Fixed\" many times, but I have not seen any improvement. Frankly the problem has only been getting worse, with more and more heavies spawning on high diff missions. Some objectives are straight up uncompletable because of the said spawn rates. Fabricator Striders made the newly added defense mission basically not worth playing. Why defend well for 20 minutes when they can just spawn and one-shot the obj? Hell, you're lucky if only one spawns, but that's usually not the case.\n\nI stopped playing bugs because of Charger and Spewer spawn rates. Decided to give them another go, only to find out they... buffed stalker. Truly amazing, the thought process has no flaws in it. I rather get juggled by devastators for eternity than play a single bug mission. At least with devastators I can blame my own positioning.\n\nStrategems are bad, I only bring 10 types of them. The rest are too situational or straight up outclassed by other ones. When's the last time you thought to yourself \"hmmm, mines would be a great idea for this mission\". Or \"Wow, the explosive radius and damage of the 500kg definetely matches it's visuals\". I can tell you that for me, answer to both of these is never.",

The strategems are one of the most fun mechanics of this game, and on higher difficulties they just get nerfed. In order to increase the difficulty, instead of nerfing the player, the operation modifiers should give some buffs to the bots instead, for instance:\n\n* More cannons protecting the outposts\n* Larger spotting distance for bots\n* More bot fabricators per outpost\n\nEtc.

            "Here is my cool, calm, collected rant on this freakin' game. Again, the game is awesome, but there are still things that are sucking the fun out of this game.\n\n1) The effects on automaton worlds. Let's start with the ion planet like Ubanea. There are effects which increase stratagem cooldown, increase deployment time, decrease stratagem slot by one. Not to mention that there are optional objectives like signal jammer and anti-air that prevents stratagems from being called. Not to mention the ion storms as an environmental effect. Might as well just bring nothing but snacks during these missions. And you guys say that you want us to prioritize stratagems rather than the main weapons. You have to temper these effects so that you can make our experience more fun, not make it frustrating with artificial difficulty. Be more creative with these effects.\n\n2) Balancing. You nerfed the railgun and breaker, then buffed the EAT and added quasar cannon. What happens is that people are just using the latter and totally forget the other stratagems and weapons. If you really want to balance the game, which is ENTIRELY PVE, then I suggest just buffing the other equipment to provide more options, and not make the game one-dimensional every patch. People speak about what the meta is and some people talk sh\\*t, or even kick other people for not bringing meta equipment to dives. This is anti-fun. You could even rollback the changes to railgun and breaker and nothing will change.\n\n3) Doing automaton missions is just too frustrating and not fun. Rockets and explosive one-hit kill attacks from rocket devastators and rocket robots do not have audio cues and signals, and my team just gets obliterated instantly even while bring shield backpack. Crashing dropships do not kill the robots that gets landed on, even the tank. Hulks would instantly kill you even if you dodge. Strategem balls bounce off the Sauron towers so the hellbomb would land far away or not at all. A lot of the primary weapons are not viable in these missions so people will just stick to meta equips to make it manageable. These are just some of the reasons why people love to just kill bugs rather than the automatons.\n\n4) Please announce all changes through the steam patch notes or just in-game announcements. Not everyone goes through discord or reddit to see these patches. Any changes to guns as well would be highly appreciated. \n\n5) This is just my personal opinion but I don't think you have to cap medals or research samples, unless you are going to monetize them in the future. It will change nothing to your business model if you put caps on it since people will just play the game to get them. If this is intended for cheaters then I don't think that you should punish everyone else, let the anti-cheat system do the punishing.\n\n6) Almost 90% of the suits are useless in this game since a lot of people would just wear what's best in terms of stats. The solution to this is just implement an appearance system, where we can pick the stat and the appearance of each suit independently (e.g., I can wear the cool champion of the people suit, while having the + grenades stat). This is will benefit not just us BUT YOU as well. Why? Because a lot of the super store suits won't be bought since people would just settle to what is best, especially when faced with the freakin' automatons. This will incentivize people to buy more suits and be more creative with their appearance, which I think is a timely thing since people would tend to change cosmetics overtime. Just make it so that the perks won't be available unless the player doesn't have the suit that provides it yet.\n\n7) Fix the damn shriekers' corpse one-shotting everything in their paths.\n\n8) Fix the damn side ramps on Pelican.\n\n9) Does localization confusion booster even work?\n\n10) Why does destroying outposts increase spawn rates? It doesn't make sense even just thinking about it mechanics wise. See if we know that destroying outpost just increases spawn rate, then we are incentivized to not destroy them. Their rewards, requisition credits and exp, don't even matter in this game when you've already unlocked everything. \n\n11) Do more optimizations to this game. If you're not adding DLSS to this game to help with framerates, then at least improve the performance of the game and fix some of the crashes.\n\n12) And for the redditors out there blaming creekers or buggers for not doing the major order, everyone just wants to have fun and you don't need to ask us to do major orders everytime. Think about it: it's just 45 FREAKIN' MEDALS FFS. I can obtain that by doing around 3-6 level 7 missions or maybe even level 5 missions if I get lucky. Heck, just do three personal orders that's it. There's not a lot to buy with medals in this game anyway and I am capped. Let others enjoy the game!\n\nSorry for the long post but I just saw the opportunity to share my thoughts in this game.

I try avoid and will tag patrols, equipment from deaths so they can find it quicker, heavies so I can target easier and make aware bigboys are there. On bots it seems like too many bots are spawned. I always prioritize the aiming up bot about to flare. I try bunch enemies to chase me so I can drop an AS on them n get 10+ kills to thin the herd. I don't have a friends group to play with (aussie). I sidestep n dive heaps to get some distance to call stratagems. I'm learning how to call blues down on top of heavies/tanks/bile titans. I prioritize stalkers, the heavy fire bot, shredder tank, I take out the dropships hoping they land on the bots. I'm only lvl 49 and could be better but with randoms. bots are sooo hard. I've got dive and melee on my mouse so it's faster. I am tired a lot so I do sometimes mess up the stratagem keys which is annoying. Maybe wrong armor, it's the second page servo throw as I kinda like the distance. Getting ragdolled isn't fun. Once too many bots are there, it's really just a waste of time (30minute games, 15minutes 50-100bots...), randoms seem to be shooting everything drawing them in. I'll be prone n trying to stealth lol cuz I feel the firepower is lacking against bots. I'm just trying to finish off my ships upgrades n unlock the rest of the warbonds. \n\nAny tips, weapon loudouts, etc? Or is it bots really make randoms hard?",

People remark that you can only kill the bug heavies with AT weapons as if that is a huge barrier, but I would love it if you could take out a tank as easily as it is to kill a charger pointing his weak spot right at you, let alone if it was as easy to kill a Devestator with a primary weapons as it is to kill a Brood Commander with the same weapon",

Don't get killed for standing in the open during a literal gunfight, played as a team. All traits I don't see in bug players 90% of my time playing. I follow the MO so I play both a lot.

He just has a very low tolerance for bullshit, and the bots have plenty. \n\nI used to be able to at least get him to play the \"Helm's Deep\" mission with bots, but after the bots started landing behind us, landing on the hills, shooting through walls and solid objects, on top of the mission occasionally bugging to where we couldn't progress, and the factory striders just LOLing the objective from behind the wall, he was done.",
            "> they are less fun and more bullshit.\n\nHorse shit.\n\nBots don't allow or enable you to just run around spraying bullets at whatever you want, and they *severely* penalise poor teamwork. *That's* why people keep saying they're \"not fun\".  \nBile titan spam is the most profoundly unfun thing in the game by a mile, by virtue of it being *literally* unsolvable when your gear and stratagems are on cooldown. Kiting around a big fuck off invincible asshole and waiting for cooldowns is the definition of uninteractive gameplay.\n\nThe difference between bug and bot helldives with randoms is clear as day. 9 times out of 10, pub groups will split off into random directions at the beginning of bugdives. On bot dives it's more like 50-50, and the groups that stick together always have a more steady, even experience. The groups that split off randomly and do their own thing always get surrounded and ceremoniously fucked.  \nAnd then probably go and complain about ragdolling and getting shot out of \"nowhere\". Then if people explain how to counteract and avoid those things, they just stick to the ever amorphous complaint of \"it just isn't fun\".\n\nAnyone who enjoys being rewarded for skilled gameplay in a shooter will at least enjoy bots for the requirement to actually *aim the fucking weapon* at their weak points.\n\nBut bots don't offer a power fantasy. You have to actually work with your team mates to bring them down and stay alive. Fucking off and completing objectives alone is a surefire way to get yourself or your teammates surrounded and killed.\n\nHence why locking difficulties separately would probably help. Your friend wants to feel like a one-man-army and is used to that on bugs. Forcing him to work his way up on bots might have actually gotten him accustomed to how to deal with them, rather than allow him to take his bugdiving mindset onto a helldive against bots.",
            "yeah,  but where possible we should be pushing past the critical worlds wherever possible so a single defense does not risk us the MOs success",

And its not like you have to rearrange your entire gear every time you dive.",

            "It's a little disheartening to see, that even in a video game, the human capacity to polarise never fails to turn everything to shit.",
            "Again, locking the difficulty would do NOTHING, because he'd get tired of the bullshit, and go fight bugs long before he got to Difficulty 9.\n\nAim is not certainly his problem, I've seen man hit 700 meter shots in Warzone consistently. He once one-shot an enemy in the head in Apex Legends that was 400m away, by anticipating when he was going to run through a blind gap and pre-firing.\n\nAs for the one man army thing, people do solo Bots on Helldive, and I've got zero doubt he could.\n\nHe just does NOT find them fun, and 40% of the player base HARD agrees and won't fight bots under any circumstances, and another 10% agree, but WILL fight bots if it's a major order, and a further 10% agree but will fight bots, BUT ONLY if said MO has a juicy reward.\n\nJust locking difficulty isn't going to jack shit about any of that.\n\nAs for Bile Titans, the same argument you gave for them could apply even harder to Gunship Fabricators. Literally only ONE thing in the ENTIRE game can kill them. ONE FUCKING THING! One thing that a bot so much as FARTS in it's general direction, it wimps out.\n\nBile titans, half a dozen support weapons can kill them, more than dozen stratagems can kill them, SEAF can kill them, some primary weapons can kill them, grenades can kill them, and they can die to a fucking knife FFS.\n\nHelldivers may focus on encouraging teamwork and can really shine when it comes together, but what makes it fun IS the power fantasy. You may be a glass cannon on Helldive versus bugs, but you are ONE HELL of a glass cannon. Versus bots, you are as much glass as you are cannon, and that's significantly LESS fun.",

The problem is that there are certain enemies that are immune to explosive damage in certain parts of their body, so you would only deal damage from the impact.\n\n-Finally, and at least the reason why I prefer it to the Scorcher, is because it has greater stagger force (35 vs 10) and a little more push force (15 vs 10). This means that the JAR-5's shots will prevent certain enemies from performing certain attacks such as Heavy Devastators, Rocket Devastators, Nursing Spewer, Bile Spewer, and stopping the Brood Commander and Stalker in their tracks.\n\nAs an additional fact, it can blow up automatic tanks by shooting through its window or even destroy Factory Strider with an entire magazine if you shoot them in their belly.\n\nSo, what do you think?\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/2n14musk838d1.gif",
