Now he's OE, and I know about it.\n\nHe's been hinting to me like \"when are you going to find another job?\". He's much higher up in the company, and now he drops it on me that layoffs are coming.\n\nI really want to tell him that it's all good, I have been OE for 2 years, and I'll be OE again in three weeks. But I can't and have to get it off my chest here.\n\nGood luck out there, keep your cards close to your chest.\n\n",
