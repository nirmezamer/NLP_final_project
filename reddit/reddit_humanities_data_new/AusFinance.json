            "A property I had my eye on has been marked as \u201cSold\u201d on realestate dot com. Unlike other listings that has the sold price, this one says \u201cContact agent\u201d. \n\nIs this common practice (I haven\u2019t seen it on other sold listings til now) and anyone know why this is? Thanks.",
            "I got pre-approval for properties up to 650k, but I think the variable interest of 6.57% p.a is a bit high, and monthly repayments of $3700 is a bit much for a minimum income of $4400 monthly\n\nMy broker seemed to overinflate my income/ or I miscalculated (maybe she took into account my tax return?)\n~~~\nAnyway, I'm signing up for the shared equity scheme, but I exchanged contract with a seller, business-day 2/5\n\nShould I withdraw my contract, and hope I get approved for the shared equity scheme? The repayments will be less since I'm borrowing less.\n\nThe only con is I forgo a decent villa at $645k, and lose the 0.25% deposit. I'm stressed on the fence\n\n~~~\nEdit: my deposit is 40k, with 20k from parents but I don't wanna rely on them, so let's say it's 40k",
            "Been dealing with an investment group that \"specialise\" in properties, We are looking at buying an IP and continuing to rent until we generate enough equity to buy a house in a capital city... But the more i look at the houses and price trends in the surround estate where they want us to buy and build the more i end up scratching my head.\u00a0\nIe new build 4 bedroom 2 car 440m\u00b2 block under strict covenant laws is high $680s .... Similar houses on bigger blocks, albeit a few years older are selling for 580~660...\u00a0\nWe really want to rent it at a reasonable price through a decent real estate and provide somewhere nice for people to live affoardably while they help us pay of part of the loan essentially so its a bit of a win win. But am i just a newb or would you too be concerned over the fact that the surrounding houses are cheaper to buy than build.",
            "I have a house. I have about $350k equity. I want to sell my house to move to our preferred location. \n\nI don\u2019t really want to sell first to live with in-laws while we look/buy. What options would you recommend?",
            "I see a lot. not sure why other than to get your details and try to sell you similar houses.",
            "Usually occurs when the sale price is not that great or when the agent just wants people to put in their database.",
            "Is this a joint or single application?\n\nYour income will definitely not be enough to cover that sort of repayments.\n\nNo risk management team is going to approve that loan",
            "You should ask to see more detail at what's happened here. It's not clear how big your loan sizes is (vs properties up-to value). How big is your deposit?\n\nIf you are saying your after-tax monthly income is 4400, I'm assuming you mean pre-tax income is ballpark 65k-69k, so a 650k house is 10x your income. If you have a regular 5-10% deposit to go, then this seems like a LOT of house.\n\nSomething in these numbers doesn't stack up. Broker looks sus here.",
            "You need a bridging loan.",
            "If you have 350k equity, it sounds like your current property may be in a good location. You could ask the sales agents if they have buyers interested in off market properties that would be willing to accept a longer settlement period while you look/buy.",
            "Bridging loan. Not all banks offer this tho.\nGive them a call, they\u2019ll want to retain you as a customer as you move onto your next property.",
            "Having $350k in equity gives you some good options beyond selling first and living with in-laws temporarily. You could look into bridge loans or equity access loans which allow you to access your existing home equity to use as a downpayment on your new place before selling the old one. Another idea is to get pre-approved for a new mortgage that includes your current home value as equity towards the downpayment then once you buy the new place, you can sell the old one without urgency. Renting out your current place rather than selling right away is an option too - use the rental income to cover some/all of the new mortgage while you look for your ideal next home. The downside is carrying two mortgages for a period but with your equity, it may be manageable until you sell. Having an experienced buyers agent to find your ideal new place could be worth considering as well. And when you do go to sell, services like\u00a0[www.listwithminty.com.au](http://www.listwithminty.com.au/)\u00a0can save thousands compared to traditional commission rates.",
            "Appreciate the reply \nI have 40k + potential 20k gift from my parents (which I don't wanna use) to deposit\n\nThe broker is so sus and my parents are pressuring me to just go with it or else we'll lose a decent property.\nI think I'm just gonna wait until the shared equity scheme is hopefully approved/ and forgo this deal in the meantime",
            "If it doesn't feel right you should definitely pass. People (agent and broker both have vested interests) will put pressure on you, but there is always another house."

Is this just our current world view and recency bias making it seem like the future is screwed? Will things get better again? Should I stay the course and make my sacrifices and continue investing or do I need to enjoy my lifestyle more?\n\nI'm curious to hear from older people who may have experienced rising interest rates and how that felt at the time.

I\u2019ll retire by 60 because I\u2019ve taken an active interest in my financial life. I truely started doing it at about 40. I wasted half my work life modding cars, partying and doing what I wanted right then, in the moment, with no view to my future.

            "This is a short period of shit. \n\nWhen i was young, we lived in a caravan park, and had no money. Chrissy present was a stick, bday pressy was a rock. we didn't know how we were going to survive.\n\nI left home in '93. Interest rates were 10% (coming down from 17%) on their way down. I was on shit wage and just started working. Rent was $150 pw for 2 bedder unit. It took 4 years to save up for a deposit by working a second job. interest rates fell to about 8% by 1997 and was time to buy as rent was the same as mortgage. Being young, i didn't realise there were things like Rates, Insurance, Body Corp, etc, so things were even tighter. wasn't sure how we were going to survive, so got a 3rd job. \n\nBy 99, rates were down to 6.5%, things were better, started getting a few pay rises (not anything great). Then 2000 hit, and rates started to rise to about 8%. No one knew if we were going back to the bad old days of 17% or not. Didn't know how we were going to survive. Was short lived though as rates came down, and things got better.\n\nWe also had 2008, but we had been through it before, so didn't worry as much, even when rates went to 10%. but that to was also short lived. What i'm saying is that every couple of years, things are shit, we are just going through one of those times. it will get better for you. don't believe all these \"the sky is falling\" idiots. these shit periods help you get through the next shit period, use it as a learning exercise.\n\nAnswer: yes, you are overreacting, but everyone does.",

We\u2019d prepare nice sandwiches and rolls if we were going for a road trip and we drank water and had water bottles, we weren\u2019t buying drinks. \n\nNever felt like we were missing out. Parents bought quality items when they did buy something and we appreciated it, this contrived image people post on social about doing wholesome stuff wasn\u2019t contrived it was simply authentic.

Would spend their free time in the garden or catch up with friends, home made cakes and or tea or coffee at someone\u2019s house or dinner parties rather than meeting someone out for dinner. \n\nBig special occasions shows, events etc were really appreciated, these may have also been birthdays where we would go out for dinner and it felt like a special occasion.\n\nLook at what you\u2019re spending money on and what is really needed or isn\u2019t and if those items actually do add value to your life.

            "I am 39 now so I am an elder millennial. I currently have a net worth of $1.95 million. Depending on who you ask, I think I have done fairly well. My advice is to focus on minimalism, contentment and degrowth. These are the key to financial independence. You do not need to buy a house to live in. In fact I still live with my parents for free and intend to do so until they kick me out, and after this I will either live with flatmates or in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe way I see it, I think the key is to accept that we cannot have a better lifestyle than our parents mainly because of natural resource depletion. Economics has separated from ecology. There is a discipline called ecological economics that brings the two disciplines together, but not many people know about it.\n\nNatural resources are finite and population grows, so rising demand over finite supply means prices must go up. We need to accept this mathematical fact and learn how to adapt to this, which means being content with living with less. We cannot expect to live on large detached houses with backyards and all drive  Hiluxes and Rangers. Such a lifestyle is wasteful and unsustainable. \n\nWe need to embrace contentment, minimalism and degrowth. Live with your parents for as long as possible to lower costs or live in a sharehouse. Rather than buy a house to live in, live with parents or flatmates permanently and instead invest in investment properties or other investments such as ETFs. Minimise your footprint and don't contribute to overpopulation by having kids. By following these rules, financial independence is practically guaranteed because we are adapting to the mathematical reality of natural resource depletion rather than expecting infinite growth.\n\nWhat is fortunate is that a sustainable and minimalist lifestyle is fully compatible with financial security and freedom. It is the expectation of more and more consumption that harms financial independent. The more tangible things we own, the more obligations and responsibilities we have, which forces us to work thereby enslaving us to our jobs. Minimalism and contentment allow us to invest more and be wealthier.",

            "I haven\u2019t lived through a high cost of living before now, but my grandfather was born in 1924 just a few years before Black Tuesday. He and his sister born 1928 grew up in the depression which lasted a good decade and right through the second world war. During this period of time living in general was pretty miserable. Luckily when he was conscripted he scored a pretty safe gig flying planes from NT and around PNG. After the war he was gifted some pretty difficult farming land out near Coonabarabran. Initially earning a living and feeding his family by trapping rabbits and selling pelts. He built a house there and eventually turned the property around and became a knowledgeable grazier. But in the early days there was no electricity, and for long period no reliable drinking water. My dad told me about long droughts, where frogs were attracted to the water tank, often frogs would die in the tank spoiling the water. They raised four children on the property.  My grandfather on the other became a POW captured by germans and held in a POW camp for years. Emancipated and full of worms as well as full of physical and mental trauma he was returned at the end of the war and led a pretty painful life until he eventually died of emphysema when I was young. My grandparents on both sides experienced incredible challenges and developed some pretty impressive frugal habits. My parents picked up some of the life skills and I think that I have picked up some of that as well which has served me well. But I can definitely be a victim of modern day consumerism. I still remember my grandmother saving her teabags for multiple uses in a purpose made ceramic teabag saving dish in the kitchen. Attitudes about reusing and using things sparingly were very different in these generations. These little habits left a big impression on me.  The current cost of living crisis seems incredibly unfair right now, and it is. But saying \u2018screw it\u2019 will only make you a victim. Those who will best off are those who can choose to ignore consumerism and live frugally and invest consistently. I just try to remind myself, yes it\u2019s an unfair economy but atleast I\u2019m not drinking frog water or waving off my husband to serve in a war who will return a shadow of a man.",
            "Back around the 1960's everyone could get a job if they wanted one but at the same time wages were low, you could rent or even buy a house, buy food to eat, buy necessities like clothes to wear, pay bills like rates and taxes. It wasn't \"high cost of living\" as such but felt like the equivalent of that due to the relatively low wages.\n\nOnce you did all that there wasn't much left over for anything so any activities you did were ones that didn't cost money like riding bicycles, taking a football or soccer ball to the local oval. \"Travelling somewhere\" was practically synonymous with just going to the beach each and every time, assuming of course if you could also run a car.\n\nPeople that lived in houses they owned or were buying on quarter acre blocks had a large amount of time on their hands and had large vegetable gardens in the back yard and grew a lot of food to save having to spend money on it. \n\nI guess that since you weren't hungry and neither were you homeless then you were reasonably well off given that when you'd meet with family or friends there were stories bandied about people that were much worse off but even then it was either (1) They had suffered some health catastrophe outside their control or (2) It was due to their stupidity and in that case there was unanimous agreement that they were deserving of their fate e.g. alcoholic or gambler usually.

Clear some room in a cupboard and you're set to brew something.\u00a0\n\n\nJust remember that it's a hobby you will improve at.

But I think a rainy day account is good to start at an amount like that if you have debts accruing interest, high rent costs/mortgage, or risk of expenses blowing out. Then that 5K can slowly become bigger over time by putting $25, $50,$75,$100 PW/F towards growing it to a sizeable amount that covers all scenarios.\n\nI guess where I'm coming from is while my situation is far from the worst. I did go from serious debt. I thought I couldn't recover to much better financial literacy and stricter budgeting. The other thing is that I used all the tools available to me for free. I saw a financial councillor through the debt recovery line, I used the moneysmart site, I read my friend's books they gave me on business accounting and watched a lot of youtuvers and ATO tools on how to lodge my bas statemtns and reregister my company without the need for insolvency or serious financial issues.\n\nThese are things available to everyone that people don't realise, and that most debts can eventually be paid off if you show the companies you owe interest in finalising them.

Electricity is in the CPI calculation, the subsidy reduces electricity spending, so the ABS which does not correct for why your power bills are lower will report a lower CPI. Statistically, this will be a lower inflation figure. Of course the subsidy gets spent anyway, because it frees up the same money to be spent on something else. But the CPI basket does not measure everything so some of the money will be invisible in the short term, and not all the money will get spent immediately. So the inflationary effect will show up later and it will be spread-out over a few months. I bet the government is hoping that by then inflation will be trending down anyway, and the deferred boost to inflation will get lost.\n\nIn the most generous reading of this, you could say the government hopes that wage rises and other price increases linked to CPI will therefore increase by less in the shorterm, and that by some virtuous cycle they will reduce inflation with a measure which hands out money, common sense please move aside. If they really think it works, they should give free electricity to everyone for six months and kill inflation. I am rating this is trick, but perhaps the Treasurer will in fact win a Nobel Prize for Economics. But how will the RBA rate it? Well, they will also see it as a trick.  \nI don't think they care about targetting because for the trick to work, they need to get a big \"negative\" pulse in something which is in the CPI basket.
