            "I have an Alaskan Spitz that loves to play fight with me all the time. He growls like this until I roughhouse with him but he never actually hurts me. It's honestly impressive how excited and playful he can get while acting like a ferocious beast and not hurt me in any way. I grab his lower jaw when he goes to 'bite\" me and he's always careful to not hurt me. When he was little he would \"bite\" my hand and then fall asleep but I figured he did that because he's blind and that way he knew I was close by?  Idk, but I bet that dog isn't nearly as aggressive as he's acting.",

He only ever would bite me when he's playing rough and wants attention, and I can tell when it's coming cause he's not sneaky. I raised him from 2 months old and I spend all day with him every day, so I trust him.\n\nThe pitbull mix... not so much. He was rescued as a puppy and raised (badly) by my sister, and I took him when she couldn't handle him. He's old and sweet and has never hurt anyone, but I'm very respectful of his space and I don't take toys or food away from him without warning. He has \"snapped\" at people but never actually bitten anyone, thankfully.\n\nAlso, for anyone who thinks pitbulls can't be sweet, he was a 10 year old dog when we got our tiny 5 pound puppy and he was instantly friendly and protective of him, and now they're inseparable tbh",

I've seen it too though I'd be hard pressed to find it, lol, it is the same blind dog doing the same thing though) wags it's tail while growling, no change in attitude, just continuously doing both.\n\nIndeed, when in doubt, do not approach.

            "Oops I summoned them sorry bud\n\n\nFTR I'm on your side, it's a breed with notoriety and so the untrained ones make the whole breed look bad. A GSD untrained or given commands to kill will fuck your shit up just the same. The training is the point. It's a ratting dog that was bred into a fighting dog and then into a home defense dog, you won't have a problem with one if it's properly trained. If pits could fuck shit up more than a GSD the military would use pits instead.\n\n\nOnly people who buy pits are the ones who think they're gosh darned cute but can't train them properly, people who want a home defense dog, drug dealers who want a scary motherfucker on a leash, etc. You gotta train the damn thing. That's part of the reason why they have higher rates of attacks, no training and too much dog to handle. Like those guys with high powered sports cars who don't know how to drive the thing and crash. It's not a dog for everyone and overbred and largely sold to irresponsible owners. A 747 is perfectly safe to fly in but you don't give a Cessna pilot one and tell them they can fly it.",
            "There are genetic differences between the breeds. Higher or lower rates of obedience, of aggression, of playfulness, curiosity, etc. Every dog is ultimately an individual and they can fall somewhere on the spectrum where they are above or below the average for their breed.\n\nBut the stats are pretty clear, pitbulls tend to be much more aggressive than other dogs. Combine that with their strong bite force and you have something like 60~70% of dog attacks being attributed to pitbulls. If I remember correctly, the next breed is Rottweiler with something like 6 or 7%\n\nThe reality is that most people do not train their dogs. And an even lower amount of people train their dogs well. I don't think pitbulls should be banned, but I also think they should be way less common than they are.",

She will still play with other people and dogs, but I trained her not to go ham with anyone but me.  She knows \u201cgentle\u201d for when taking a treat she\u2019s real excited about too.  German shepherd, pitbull, Akita, lab mix.  It sounds like she has murderous intentions when we play and she\u2019s a tank.  She hardly ever gets overzealous anymore, but when she does I say \u201ctoo hard,\u201d and she waits until I initiate again.  It\u2019s not really that she bites me too hard, it\u2019s that she runs into me with her mouth open too hard once in a while.",

He knows he can grab my hands/arms with his mouth, but not bite, and judo throw me (i roll and twist, so not to get hurt by his teeth when he pulls me around) he will never play rough with my wife unless its tug-of-war with toys, and even then only to her level, but he\u2019ll torpedo into me, wrestle and jump, because he knows I allow more aggressive play-time. He can growl and be my big danger boi when we play, and he turns into her furry lovable protector when they are by themselves. Of course when we are rough and growling, we also constantly huff at each other to make sure we are both just playing around.",

He\u2019ll default to waiting for me to grab the toy too before he starts really tugging. \n\nHe\u2019ll also run away with his toy and wait for her to come get it, if she doesn\u2019t he\u2019ll bring it back to her. \n\nI\u2019ve had a busy week, now I really want to wake him up and start horsing around with that good boy.",

It's not really \"revenge\" though, pack/herd elders teach their young about threats and how to deal with them.  An orca gets hit by a boat, so it teaches it's young that boats are threats.  Orcas deal with other threats similarly to how they are dealing with the boats.
