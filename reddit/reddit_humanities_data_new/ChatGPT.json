With average costs of >$100/h and long waitlists, therapy is simply inaccessible to most. We want to change that. We don't want to replace therapists, but make those people happier who can't see one.\n\nSonia can conduct entire cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions, both by voice and text via an iOS app. We've digitally reconstructed the trusted structure of CBT (mood check, agenda setting, cognitive restructuring, \u2026) as a finite state machine. These states get traversed by an LLM agent in \\~30min sessions.\n\nSonia has several security and privacy measurements in place, such as automatic redirection to national help hotlines in emergency cases. We would love to get feedback from the Reddit community on how to make Sonia even safer and more effective, and any features that might be nice to implement/see going forward!\n\n**Download the app here:** [**Download Sonia**](http://download.soniahealth.com/app?src=rt)\n\nThankful in advance for your feedback :) Cheers!",

This means every journey through the book can be unique, tailored to your interests and decisions.\n3. **Engagement and Discovery**: This tool isn't just for passive reading. It's designed to engage you actively, encouraging exploration and discovery through a visually rich interface.\n\nI've created a link where you can experience this for yourself and see how the AI Architect enhances your reading adventure.

Essentially it functions as an information exchange hub for users and bots.\n\n[I've recorded a demo video explaining this approach and showing the current state of development and also demonstrating my take on speech interactions with the LLM's.](https://youtu.be/OqT_kIhz8Dc?si=k7Gijd24t9pt8tvU)\n\nI believe that having the bots' logic running in long-running processes that can continuously process and receive information will be crucial for creating a smooth LLM/Agent interaction experience (like GPT-4o for voice chat; see my demo for open-chat's take on that).\n\nThe backend provides REST + WebSocket APIs for a standard chat messaging application. Any bot can connect as a regular user and utilize the same APIs. The frontend is built with React, Redux, TailwindCSS, and ShadcnUI.\n\nOf course, I know, love, and also use other chat interfaces like OpenWebUI, but I think that the approach of open-chat can be highly beneficial for small companies or individuals who want to self-host and interface with multiple LLM-related purposes.\n\nIt can be connected to all your devices, allowing for communication and management in a sort of self-managed botnet. Personally, I want to run an LLM at home, connect all my controllable utilities (like fans, power strips, etc.) to open-chat, and then write a 'controller' agent that you can talk to in order to control any of these devices.\n\nCurrently, I'm unaware of anything similar, but maybe you are (let me know!). In the future, simple bot connectors for things like emails, WhatsApp Web, etc., can be created to serve specific automation purposes, and these bridges can also be self-managed by the user, hopefully circumventing most 'automation blocking' issues from big platform providers.\n\nLet me know what you think; I'd love some further feedback. Also, please notify me if you wish to join the beta!",

            "As Nick Bostrom predicted about a decade ago: \u201cGiven the extreme security implications of superintelligence, governments would likely seek to nationalize any project on their territory that they thought close to achieving a takeoff. A powerful state might also attempt to acquire projects located in other countries through espionage, theft, kidnapping, bribery, threats, military conquest, or any other available means... If global governance structures are strong by the time a breakthrough begins to look imminent, it is possible that promising projects would be placed under international control.\u201d Whatever you may think about OpenAI or the likelihood that we are on the road to superintelligence, it\u2019s difficult for me to conceive that our government and intelligence agencies aren\u2019t monitoring this space VERY closely, because there is a very real chance they may have to abruptly step in and nationalize one or more promising projects at some point over the next five years. So I don\u2019t find this development overly surprising from that perspective (even though it\u2019s an odd feeling to see the pieces slowly coming together).",

The NSA has long been associated with surveillance of US citizens, and AI-embedded technologies are already renewing and escalating existing surveillance concerns. With that in mind, it might be unsurprising that former NSA employee and famed whistleblower Edward Snowden is among the OpenAI appointment's outspoken detractors.\n\n\"They've gone full mask off: do not ever trust OpenAI or its products,\" Snowden \u2014 emphasis his \u2014 wrote in a Friday post to X-formerly-Twitter, adding that \"there's only one reason for appointing\" an NSA director \"to your board.\"\n\n\"This is a willful, calculated betrayal of the rights of every person on earth,\" he continued. \"You've been warned.\"\n\nTransparency Worries\n\nSnowden wasn't the only prominent cybersecurity figure to raise an eyebrow at the OpenAI news.\n\n\"I do think that the biggest application of AI is going to be mass population surveillance,\" Johns Hopkins University cryptography professor Matthew Green tweeted, \"so bringing the former head of the NSA into OpenAI has some solid logic behind it.\"\n\nNakasone's installation comes after a series of high-profile OpenAI departures that included prominent safety researchers, in addition to the total dissolution of OpenAI's now-defunct \"Superalignment\" safety team. OpenAI's replacement for that team, the Safety and Security Committee, is now helmed by company CEO Sam Altman, who has come under fire in recent weeks for business practices that involved silencing former employees. It's also worth noting that OpenAI has routinely drawn criticism for \u2014 again \u2014 its lack of transparency regarding the data used to train its many AI models.\n\nBut at the same time, per Axios, many on Capitol Hill see Nakasone's OpenAI assensure as a security win. And Nakasone, for his part, said in a statement that OpenAI's \"dedication to its mission aligns closely with my own values and experience in public service.\"\n\n\"I look forward to contributing to OpenAI's efforts,\" he added, \"to ensure artificial general intelligence is safe and beneficial to people around the world.\u201d",

            "Yeah, I think your comment is the perfect summary of the situation. No matter how you view it, there's no reason why he should be put on the board.\n\nIf it was actually cyber-security focused, there's un-jokingly people more qualified at other companies (Google, Amazon, Meta) that would 100% take a job or board seat at OpenAI. Him being put on the board is the equivalent of someone of the C-suite of McDonalds being told he's the head of kitchen operations and how to run everything related to it. I'm not saying he lacks complete knowledge in cybersecurity but there's definitely a disconnect between someone who's the director of an entire organization versus someone who actually works in cybersecurity on a closer level.\n\nNot only that, it's not as if he left the U.S. government and was inactive for multiple years before joining OpenAI. He left the U.S. government 4 months ago according to his wikipedia page and was supporting FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act which in my opinion is too invasive but that's just my opinion) where the government more or less can do what it wants in terms of data collection. So it's not as if this person was inactive in politics; he was and still is actively vested in politics and supporting policies favoring the government versus the average person\n\nSource:  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul\\_Nakasone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Nakasone) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/02/14/nsa-director-paul-nakasone-section-702-fisa/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/02/14/nsa-director-paul-nakasone-section-702-fisa/)",

YOU don't understand what you don't understand. YOU are not seeing much if any of the overall picture. \n\nI judge Snowden by his actions, and his recent actions have all been in service of damaging American interests and in league with those that are in open conflict with us and our ideals. Do you think Snowden feels free to say anything he wants in Russia? Could he criticize the war? Or would you say whatever he's saying now goes through the filter of: \"does this help Russia\" first?
