            "Lost is actually surprisingly defensive due to his starting with flight and mantle.  You do have to play carefully, but those two things alone let you avoid 99% of damage you would take on a grounded character and whatever 1% you would normally take, the mantle is there to cover as well.\n\nAlso, you just kinda get used to the BS deaths if you get far enough to actually unlock and play Lost.\n\nHe is a fun, but frustrating character.  T. Lost is even scarier as you don't get the mantle, but he gets an inherent damage multiplier and a more focused item pool.\n\nBoth characters are a blast to play, even though they are definitely 'challenge' characters.",
