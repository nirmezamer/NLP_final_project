            "So like you said before there's a lot of hot debate around the topic. *Personally* I think both genders should shoot for 20%. That way you can cut a little bit for a photo shoot or whatever but your *normal* BMI is safely on the side of \"enough fat to maintain adequate hormone balance and overcome minor fasting without impacting lean mass\".\n\nThere are absolutely people who would disagree with me and there isn't a lot of good science on the topic if your area of concern is longevity. Personally though I'm very pro fat in the sense that I think your thyroid and subsequently hormone levels require lots of lipids *and* that lean mass is the most important figure and your body should **never** need to metabolize muscle for energy. Adequate fat reserves compensate for the chaos of a life well lived.\n\nAesthetically 20% does not look nearly as attractive as 15%, I cede that point, but I seriously question if the aesthetics are worth the health risks. I also really question if males should be simulating a fasted state long term. Because of menstruation and associated hormones we have a lot of evidence that women risk hormonal imbalance at lower BMI but I *personally* question if men risk the same issues in a less obvious way. The little bit of recent research on testosterone shows that adequate fat/water/salt are beneficial to higher T levels. Again this is personal conjecture and not based in any solid science.\n\nAs far as the 4%/11% those are *bare minimum* figures meant to track **starvation** among **malnourished** populations. Any serious body builder will tell you that they are *suffering* at those low BMI numbers and cannot maintain that level long term. Again I question the safety of even getting that low willingly but I digress. If you want to encourage health and wellness, don't look at starvation measures, look at where the body is healthy without detriment either way.",

            "as  I just responded to another person\n\n\"i can promise you if a your average gym attending man was placed beside her along with your average gym attending female they would certainly look closer to the male then the female lol.  She is shredded like a man on steroids.... i don't get why this is so offensive... human beings in general aren't this fucking shredded because this isn't a natural look at all.  However, the biggest percentile of steroid users are male and so yeah... she looks closer to that percentile of humanity...\n\n\"Oh, if you excluded everything but the breasts, it would look like a woman? make sense.\"\n\nAre you always this difficult and needlessly pedantic?  I was literally making a comparison since the women in this picture also has their face/hair obscured so you can only see the muscle fibers of her legs which absolutely resemble that of a male body builder which there are FAAR more of then female.\n\nHow you struggle so hard with this very basic premises while trying to make it seem like your average female looks like this is ridiculous gaslighting lol.\n\nPeak masculine form would be something along the lines of how hercules is portrayed in mythology... peak masculine form would be more something along the lines of Aphrodite or what have you... sorry if this offends you but thats just the way most human beings have perceived the male and female form throughout history.  Yes you can make an argument for more rounded women being considered attractive in medieval times compared the thin women we have today but thats besides the point and I hate that I even feel the need to defend that point because your being so needlessly difficult about this.\n\nIf you're an exception that prefers their females looking like this power to you but you have to admit that you're an exception and your taste isn't regular.",
            "Personally I think those numbers are genetic abnormalities and not representative of the general population, but they are *far* more acceptable than 4 and 11%",
            "I'm sorry bro but if a man with a similar amount of muscle was in the same picture, I can promise you it wouldn't look the same.",
            "Yep. The foreground with the legs that belong to a woman. Yes. We are talking about that human female in the picture.",
            "That\u2019s a lot of words to deflect from the fact at she\u2019s clearly a woman. \n\nUsing this logic, tall women look like men. Or men with long hair look like women. Or skinny men look like women. \n\nSorry bud. You can immediately tell she\u2019s a woman, and if you\u2019re arguing this hard otherwise, it\u2019s most likely due to your own sexual repression."

They didn\u2019t even see those women as humans really, just prizes. Agamemnon was taking prizes from ALL the men, which dishonored them, but no one was willing to stand up to him, until Achilles. \n\nAchilles didn\u2019t care about that girl, or anything really, except his pride, his honor, and Patroclus. Whether or not you think he was gay, Achilles cares more about Patroclus than that woman. Also, having sex with younger men if you were a man of high standing in ancient Greek culture as just part of the norm. That\u2019s been well documented. There\u2019s not really much to argue on that point. Saying Achilles had something more than a platonic relationship with Patroclus is not that outlandish.",
