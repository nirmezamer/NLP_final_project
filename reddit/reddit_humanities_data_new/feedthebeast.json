            "Tip: you can use the Fel Pumpkin from Botania to summon a Blaze to capture in a Create Blaze Burner.",
            "If you're looking for a 'starter project' once you have an initial base, look no further then a Cobbleworks. Cobblestone is magic in minecraft, even in vanilla; With just vanilla, cobblestone is not just the expected stone products, but also moss, dirt and its byproducts (including clay, insert balanced meme here), and even bonemeal. With mods included? You can typically add gravel and sand, and all the things you can process that down to that depends on the mods involved, but can include just about every basic overworld resource. That's without counting stuff like Botania's orechid straight up converting it in to ores. A cobble-processing system should always be one of the first big projects of a world, and something to revisit as the player progresses to see what said progression has further opened up.\n\nAlways check what a wandering trader offers, at least in the early and mid game. Not only can they have saplings that could take you thousands of blocks of travel to get and nautilus shells, but quite a few mods add their own trades to them, such as Apotheosis' overenchanted special named gear that is game-changing early on. If you are just shy of being able to do the trade? Shove them through a nether portal. As long as that part of the nether isn't loaded, their despawn timer shouldn't count down, buying you extra time to gather what you need.\n\nWardens only fire their sonic boom if their target is within 15 blocks horizontally and 20 blocks vertically. They are easily killable from range with no risk, as shown by Pixelriffs killing 30 wardens in about an hour here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roYtYWEGztk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roYtYWEGztk) Between mods adding drops to give more reason to kill them, and modpacks adding quests to kill them, that changes the Warden from being a scary challenge to an annoying speedbump.",
            "You can use create's mixer for recipes from [Let's do] vinery. Easter to automate and sometimes allows usage of different juices.",
            "Tip: Create Bottomless Hose Pulley does not require 10,000 Source Block. 2 Source block is the bare minimum, flowing counts.\n\nHow it work is that the hose pulley hose lowered to touch the first source, and it will read if there is 10,000 liquid in between to the top.\n\n\nWorks in every version of create.",
            "If you have Refined Storage and AE2 on the same pack, try to keep your RS network small and use it in the same way subnetworks work in AE2 if you have a potato pc and want to save frames. \n\nTry and automate ANYTHING POSSIBLE with AE2 subnets as they are EXTREMELY powerful for anything you can think of. Think automating AE2 circuits without taking up any channels on your main network AND all you have to do to make any circuit is supply the raw materials so it can easily be put into a pattern.\n\nThink of literally anything to automate. You might not think it would be possible to automate magic mods that aren\u2019t programming based, but think again. Combined with integrated dynamics, literally anything is possible. As in using raw block data possible.\n\nAlso try to learn red stone logic for AE2 since even a simple AND red stone gate is enough to make sure you have the right materials queued in a recipe or order and it\u2019s even more powerful with red stone add on mods.\n\nThis might not rub off on more experienced AE2 players, but less experienced players might not realize how tremendously powerful AE2 and other logistic mods really are and might not think to do some of these things.",
            "In Ominous Woods biome from Biomes'O Plenty only enderman and cave spiders (and I think illusioners in newer versions) are allowed to spawn , so farming for enderpearls there could be very fruitful and safe (or you can just not meet a single mob for entire night)",
            "If you have plates, gears in a modpack, tinker's construct's smeltery can produce them more efficiently, for example:\n\n2 ingots for a plate in a crafting table, 1 ingot for a plate in tk smeltery\n\n4 ingots for a gear in a crafting table, 2 ingots for a gear in tk smeltery\n\nworks in many modpacks (enigmatica 2 expert, for example, you get a better ingot --> plate ratio, but doesn't work with gears). It's a great alternative before you get a machine capable of making plates.",

            "Create's mixer can do any shapeless recipe.",
            "Can you give more details about how to make this work?",
            "I agree ae2 is so op, you just input raw materials and get the item in return, skipping the 30 step crafting stage. But autocrafting tools in ae2 is a big mistake, instead of crafting 1 tool, ae2 will make tens or hundreds of them.",
            "Please don't do that, make a datapack instead. Just never edit jar files",
            "At this point just rebuild the mod.",
            "[Let's do] Vinery uses fermenting barrel, not crafting table for it's recipes. Even so, the main point is in ability to substitute juices.",
            "Easiest way is...\n\nMake a rectangular hole 16x16x41 (room for error)\n\n\nLower hose pulley all the way down to the most bottom. Raise it by 1 when it touch the bottom. Place your lava there (source #1).\n\n\nNow go back to the top. Make a platform on the 2nd highest y of your container. Fill the platform with lava 16x16 until you don't see air. Break the platform and let it flow down.\n\n\nNow once you extract from the hose pulley with mechanical pump it should show bottomless.\n\n\n2 bucket method require very big space and pyramid shape. The above method takes around 50-100 bucket max.",
            "just use the pattern to request materials to a subnet and remove the tool from the recipe so that it manages the recipe from there and you can crush your dusts in a crafting grid with a hammer without making more than one hammer.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple problem to fix really. It\u2019s just exporting materials and telling the network you will get X item back into it from a pattern even though the pattern doesn\u2019t use the exact recipe.\n\nIt\u2019s how you can automate magic stuff by making a pattern that sends cobblestone somewhere and the output in the pattern is lava fluid so it expects lava when you request from that pattern.",
            "Honestly, there's really nothing wrong with editing jar files if you know what you're doing. I did jar files all the time and I run into no problems.",
            "You won't break an entire mod that way, but updating resets every change, so just make a datapack."

Then you forget. You plug your quarry into your ME network. And then? My god, then. You are processing copper until the day you die. You take it out, sure, but the damage is already done.
