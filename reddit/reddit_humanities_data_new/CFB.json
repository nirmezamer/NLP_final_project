I think the school should be more flexible for doing it later in the season. At this point, of the realistic options of games I think it ought to be Maryland this year.

So, if we want to aim exclusively for night then we have to accept our options are limited.\n\nBut you and I have both been to end-of-season games at the 3:30 timeslot, they get dark. The lights come on. I think we still get a great feel out of that and it should not be totally neglected since it opens up our window of what would be a competitive team out of potential timeslots.",
            "Not to mention the poor, unfortunate saps who work/live in Philly, Pittsburgh, and the DMV having to decide whether to drive up Friday for the noon kick Saturday or wake up before the ass-crack of dawn Saturday to make it in time.",
            "Typically we have announced it in May prior to the season starting the past couple of years.",
            "Usually around now.",
            "It's normally announced  when the early times come out in may. This year it's probably  a little different  due to the four new west coast  schools. Normally the white out was the easy pick for whoever had second choice. However with the new schools it's a little harder (especially  in year 1.) CBS probably  took USC @ Michigan  first (probably  was the network that traded up with fox for the third pick) and Fox probably  took it before NBC had a chance due to that weekend  having both osu vs psu and oregon vs Michigan.",
            "Usually in May when tv times come out. The fact that it hasn\u2019t been announced yet means the school is stuck in a tough place trying to figure out what to do with it. Either that or trying to pull some strings either the networks to make something happen",
            "I also read something a month ago about CBS being upset with the Penn State Whiteout ratings last year... It was a rain soaked blowout and they put it against Ohio State Notre Dame. What did they think was going to happen?",
            "But it's not more marketable because night has tougher competition. That's exactly why CBS ended up settling on 3:30 and later Fox on at noon. Fox putting a game on at night would directly competing with NBC's and ABC's biggest games of the weekend. Nobody else puts their biggest games on at noon, hence Fox's success with viewership.\n\nFox would only benefit moving out of the noon timeslot if Disney or CBS moved out of their preferred timeslots.",
            ">You would think Fox would want it too.\n\nThey have MLB stretch run/ playoffs / World Series at night. Guess you could argue for putting it November every year but then the elements come into play.",

            "You aren't excited for the 630 kick off on 11/29?  Unless we get freak weather that week, everyone in the stands will turn into meat popsicles if they aren't careful.",
            "Personally I prefer a 2:30 kick for that game.",
            "That's a good question. I was more thinking of pre this existing Fox plan for noon games. How long have they had the first pick and noon slot? Like back into the mid 2000s?",
            "I honestly cannot remember a time that The Game wasn't played at noon so I just assumed that both teams demanded it be protected for the last week of the season at that time slot.",

            "No. Whiteout is the biggest recruiting date for the program so you could not have it the same day recruits would be playing ball. \n\nAlso no",
            "There are classes all day on Friday. I couldn't imagine the crowd for a whiteout on top of a full campus.",
            "no. literally every fan and everyone in the administration - even CJF - said they hate Friday games. That's for high school. FOX can pitch that but everyone will pass, even if it's a game against the Steelers/Eagles all stars",
            "Not for big games. The idea is that no one was putting their \u201cbig\u201d games at noon and putting a major game at noon was an easy way to easily get more viewers in that time slot since it\u2019s the only major game then.",
            "Iowa was *ok*. Minnesota was a joke and it\u2019s looking like we are going to get that again. The only good options are Ohio state and Washington and neither one is looking promising. I don\u2019t get all the people that were hoping for a UCLA whiteout the last couple months, to me them and Illinois are the same.",
            "There will definitely be noon games when they're away.",
            "Rutgers has a 11 PM game. So they aren't that concerned with the local market of some schools and 9 AM is way more reasonable to watch a road game on TV.",
            "You have no idea what you're talking about. West Coast teams have been playing road games at Noon for a long time. Oregon over Ohio St. at the Shoe in 2021 was a Noon game.",
            "Almost like having regional conferences made sense from a time zone standpoint.  Dissolving the Pac 12 was so, so incredibly stupid and I\u2019ll never stop being mad about it.",

            ">  since it would be 9am PT\n\nAnd why did they agree to that?\n\nBecause *most* bars/restaurants aren't open that early, so they'd lose viewership of the casual west coast fan.  And advertisers aren't stupid.",
            "instead they are giving USC - Rutgers an 8pm PACIFIC kick... aka, 11pm eastern game for an east coast team.   by the time that game finishes it will be past 2am for eastern time rutgers... but fuck em, it's rutgers, right?",
            "Jokes on you, its Fox so the game still won't end until 4pm. Its a sacrifice Allstate is willing to make.",
            "That's interesting. Usually when I hear someone's preference for noon kicks it's flipped: like knocking out their game on TV and having the rest of the day.\n\nUltimately, it doesn't matter what fans want because conferences and administrators will always be beholden to the millions of dollars from TV networks.\n\nAllegedly, ESPN/ABC is looking into counterprogramming Big Noon better, so if we see better SEC/etc matchups in that early window, does FOX rethink putting EVERY relevant B1G game at noon? Probably a pipe dream, but I'll take any hope I can get.",
            "When we can\u2019t pick the time of the game that leads to games like the blowout against Minnesota. The point of the whiteout is to make an atmosphere that benefits our team against the team we need it the most. No offense to Illinois fans but that would be a massive downgrade for us compared to the normal opponents we play in the whiteout.",
            "There is no known night kick as of today.",

            "I think it was NBC who traded with Fox for the third pick, and they got Oregon/Ohio State.",
            "Appreciate it and all other responses - asked because I'm based in DC and making the rounds to some drivable games this year. I feel like if you're going to go to one Penn State game it simply has to be the white out but I hadn't found any info on the date. Just assumed it would be Ohio State",

            "The 06 game was at 3:30 but that's the only time I can remember it not being at noon.",
            "It actually used to be a 1PM game some years until TV contracts with conferences became the thing in the 80s and 90s. So it's either been a noon, 12:30 or 1PM kickoff the entire rivalry except for the 3:30 kickoff in 2006.",

            "There\u2019s nothing wrong with Friday games in general.\u00a0\n\nIt just makes 0 sense for PSU to play a home Friday game.\u00a0\n\nThey have a 100,000 seat stadium. And the majority of the people paying for tickets live 2-3 hours away and have to go to a job on a Friday. It just can\u2019t happen logistically.\u00a0",
            "I would be shocked if any west coast team has a single noon eastern game. They were added to attract west coast viewers, scheduling them at 9am local doesn\u2019t get west coast viewers.

            "It\u2019s certainly a great experience. We all hoped it would be Ohio State until Fox hinted that they have  the pick for that game. The last couple years the school has moved to the stance that the whiteout has to be at night and not the best team. But this year it\u2019s looking like we might  not even get a single night game, or if we do it\u2019ll be Illinois so we\u2019re stuck between a rock and a hard place here.",
