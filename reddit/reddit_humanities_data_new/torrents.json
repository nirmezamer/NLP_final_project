CCleaner does this as well, and it's considered one of the best (if not the top) drive cleaner.\n\n> Qbittorrent is free and open source.\n\nutorrent is free as well. Also the most recent security exploit in utorrent [is from 2018](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-6117/Utorrent.html) while the most recent qbittorrent exploit was discovered [only a few months ago.](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-16171/Qbittorrent.html) On top of that, the exploit affects every version of qbittorrent since it was first released. Which is the *exact* situation that source code auditing is supposed to prevent. And yet that didn't happen.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that it's interesting how utorrent is objectively safer to use than qbittorrent, despite not being open source.",

Sure, should have been programmed to force default credential change but come on, anyone enabling and setting up web interface should know to change those credentials. I'll test when I get home to see if that has been fixed though its probably able to be confirmed through Google. As 4.5.5 is no longer the current version.\n\nAlso, I'd rather have open source and the ability for anyone to audit the code than closed. And who knows what vulnerabilities might exist in uTorrent. Possibly ones that are known by malicious groups now and not being shared or reported. At least with qbittorrent there is the ability for anyone to look deep into the issues.\n\nGuess we'll have to agree to disagree but I can tell you the overall community of piracy and torrenting would back the qbittorrent position over the uTorrent position.",

Which is virtually impossible to do with a closed-source client.\n\n> I can tell you the overall community of piracy and torrenting would back the qbittorrent position over the uTorrent position.\n\nutorrent accounts for [70% of all torrent client installs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_BitTorrent_clients) whereas qbittorrent accounts for 3.4% - down from 18.75% just 5 years earlier.\n\nFor every person who installs qbittorrent, 20 people install utorrent.",
