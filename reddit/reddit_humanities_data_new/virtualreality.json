            "Silent Slayer: Vault of the Vampire - a fun puzzle/horror game in the vein of the old table top game Operation with some good jump scares. \n\nYou are a vampire slayer tasked with dispatching 7 vampires while they sleep in their coffins. Each vampire has a series of increasingly difficult traps you must disarm before you can plunge a stake into its heart. A talking book (with a voice that bears more than a passing resemblance to Darth Sidious) will guide you along the way.\n\nThis is one of those games that is easy to learn but will take multiple tries to beat and has some really well done hand gesture mechanics. It took me about eight hours to see two of the game's three endings so I still have more to see and do.\n\nRating: 4/5 - The last two or three vampires can be really hard to kill and I wouldn't have minded a difficulty slider to make things just a little more forgiving. Also, when using one of your tools to disarm the traps your hands disappear, which has always been a little immersion breaking for me. But both of these are very minor quibbles.",

            "Finished Max Mustard on Quest 3. Not a fan of linear level based platformers, but I absolutely loved Max Mustard. Beautiful game, fun levels and just challenging and long enough. Can't recommend this game enough. Btw, I bought it before 90% off code. No regrets. Absolutely worth its full price.\n\n\nPlaying Miracle Pool and this is one of the best MR games yet. Physics are on the same level as in Eleven Table Tennis, but MR graphics are even better and more realistic. Once I lined up MR table with my kitchen table, the realism went through the roof. Feels like playing a real pool game.\n\n\nPlaying around with Figmin XR. Another top MR app. Hours fly while playing around with it."

It\u2019s such an incredible experience and I don\u2019t know a single person in real life who has been able to do this. It seems so inaccessible to so many people (it is expensive and can be tough to get all the tech working) but holy crap man virtual tourism is the future.

            "For anyone wondering about performance, something like as ween above will run at about 45 reprojected which is fine because of the slow paced nature of the game.\n\nThis game however is one of the best use cases of a Quest pro or other eye tracked headset. This game supports Quad Views which dramatically increases performance and is a feature only available on headsets with eye tracking",
            "I have Q3 and QP. Below are some hints for both. I play wireless over Virtual Desktop.\n\nClarity is always a thing. I have a 3080 ... and sure enough a 4090 would be better. The trick is to get acceptable results with the hardware at hand. I can live with my specs ...\n\n... Q3 on 72 Hz ... VD on Ultra/Godlike and with SSW always on!! (so fps halfed to 36!!) with streamer on VDXR HEVC10 ... MSFS DLSS(!!) on Balanced/Quality ... 5GHz dedi router 2m/6ft away\n\nThis should make things smooth. Check this with the VD framerate counter! Now tweak gfx, mid to high to ultra (eg clouds on high) etc. Dont push.\n\nDlss makes the picture somewhat soft, which I do not mind. I tried several sharpening flters. They work, but it feels somewhat artificial, so I go for some softness. Np for me.\n\nBtw, I have 32GB ram. And do recording on Quest3 (not on pc)\n\nOne trick for nightflying with Q3 is to lower the brightness all the way down to ZERO\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udc4d ... It will make nightflying a joy. Not oled joy but very workable. The 'grey mess' is gone and your eyes will(!) adapt to the lower brightness. Low light/Nightflying is a important part of MSFS for me\n\nAnother important setting ... TRAFFIC (cars, ships, fauna) ... set those to ZERO\n\nMicrostutters see https://youtu.be/I8PZJJ25olk \n\nMore info (I took my info form these 2 sources):\n\nhttps://www.avsim.com/forums/topic/645221-where-to-get-the-bing-version-of-google-maps-enhancement/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzWCfIfxUjs\n\nHope this helps",

That would be the most viable path but it doesn't do anything for them more than slightly increase sales of Xbox because if people already have a Quest they *might* see it as an advantage and buy one instead of a PS5. And it would require actual VR titles to run on the Xbox - they'd have to port over titles or VR enable existing titles. It's a lot of work.\n\nI do think this second one could be worth doing but only IF they partner with Meta and some studios to bring over the titles.",

And Xbox has a much smaller player base than PlayStation at this point so I think it would do far worse on Xbox at this point. From what I understand, the PS4 outsold the Xbox one like 3 to 1 and PS5 vs the Xbox Series X/S is like 5 to 1.\n\nI think Quest and then PC are going to be the main platforms until VR really takes off.

            "I think it'd be weird for them to go all in on it, especially with PSVR2 kinda failing in the market.\n\n\nI think the Kinect burned them when trying something weird and new and they don't want a repeat of that just yet.",
            "We are talking about a company that couldn't bother putting gyros into their gamepads, VR is obviously too radical for them.",
            "Nvidia bought Xbox",
            "I think they should just cooperate with Meta. Microsoft will fail hard if they try it. It's just like the handheld, rather than just introducing competitive to Ally X handheld, they try to reinvent the wheel by focussing on ARM rather than X86. Which on paper is very cool but we've passed that stage of shaping the market.",
            "I dont understand this take when sony who has a bigger playerbase atm are struggling to sell PSVR2. Both companies are going to a handheld future, not VR",
            "\"I swear there is a MASSIVE market opportunity\" i see it, it like sony pcvr2 make a lot of money and sell super well and have huge industry support right ?\n\nxbox is in a same boat , main problem about VR is how non standard it is, onlymeta have some development guidance and similar stuff, we need at least 5-8 years for VR to get in to easy to pick and develop stage",
            "Microsoft got burned by hololens and WMR.",
            "I think xbox was trying vr in a very final stage. Look at the new indiana jones game with this in your mind.  But they cancle it.",
            "As much as I'd like to see more vr games and competition; vr is a risky move. Most people buy it and it collects dust within a year. Gamers are lazy and judgemental of silly looking beat saber videos.",
            "Dont rush things, either we're at the start of a big thing and we'll all look back on these days with nostalgia or it's just not gonna catch on and reach a global scale as we hope it will and that's cool too because we're part of a niche hobby with an enthusiastic community (not counting the obligatory yelling kids). Both scenarios seem good to me.",
            "I believe the problem is that most people haven't actually tried vr yet. For me personally, I thought it would basically be a monitor up to your face.",
            "Microsoft has no interest in innovating. They are purely profit driven and have stated that the market just isnt profitable enough for them to care about it. This mentality has infected their gaming-branche years ago and it feels like every descision they make is determined by cold data in a  boardmeeting. They are out of touch with their customers.",
            "I could imagine them just enabling 3rd party headsets on Xbox before making their own. Quest users would explode.",
            "Yeah after they fucked up 2 consecutive console generations out of pure stupidity, it would be really hard and expensive for them to recover from that.",
            "Wasn't Microsoft making some mixed reality goggles back in 2017? I wonder why it died down for them. I remember playing around with those at some lab which also had a vive and oculus. It was sorta like a first look at spatial computing with these interfaces floating in the air, but had bad viewing angles.\n\nAH yes, it was Hololens. Just googled it. Apparently they stopped further development in 2021.",
            "Quest 2 sold almost as much units, as Series S&X combined; and there was a brief period when Q2 was actually ahead by a few hundreds thousands units. So, either Microsoft really sucks at gaming hardware, or VR is not a niche thing anymore. Either way tere's no point in beliving their market analysis team.",
            "The company that spent millions on market research to launch xbox one with picture-in-picture as the big selling point.\n\nResearch doesn't do any good if they have morons interpreting the data.",
            "Yeah and do you remember why?",
            "Lol we have been hearing that since the OG Xbox launched.",
            "no. they are not going pc route they are allowing other stores to sell console xbox games on the xbox",
            "I mean\u2026depends how you\u2019re counting. The original PSVR sold over 7 million units, which makes it the second highest-selling (real) VR system of all time behind only the Quest 2.",
            "They won\u2019t necessarily have to compete with Meta. All they need to do is make Xbox work with Quest the way PC works with Quest. Maybe in next gen Xbox they can include whatever radio they might not have in current generation. \n\nIt\u2019s a win win and I\u2019m sure Meta would love to support it, I think the problem would be prioritization on Microsoft side.",
            "Paired with Microsoft Kinect for full body tracking :)",
            "That's because, you know, they promised this https://youtu.be/oyjNqksc-m8?si=ReOJuRxOZg7VXymL",
            "Ugh. I love how this story continues to get spun.\n\nSony is not doing well in VR, but...\n\nFinding a story that starts with \"2 new exclusives\" and then spinning that to \"only making 2 games\" is wild.\n\nNothing there says it's the last two games. This guy from Android Central has been going scorched earth on PSVR2 via his Twitter and no one questions it?",
            "Kinect was incredibly bad and incredibly bad for them. You\u2019ve probably just highlighted one of the main reasons they\u2019re not trying VR. They\u2019ve also dabbled a little with HoloLens.",
            "Theres no way you actually believe this",
            "Yeah, they found some success in industrial fields, but consumers just didn\u2019t want it.  Interestingly, you can still buy them, but they cost more than the Vision Pro and are objectively worse than the AVP in just about every technical way.\n\nI was excited about HoloLens when it came out, but it was so damn expensive that it never made sense for me to buy one.",
            "Sales volume isn't everything, especially for consoles. Retention matters even more, because game sales is where companies actually make money. And retention with VR is notoriously bad.\n\nMeta was able to get a lot of units out the door by selling below cost (before raising it a couple years after release). And their aggressive (subsidized) pricing pushed a lot of competitors out of the market, which just leads to more sales as they're the last one standing. But how many of those millions of headsets sold are actually used on a regular basis now?",
            "Quest 2 had a uniquely good set of circumstances at the time that contributed to its success. It had a very low price, no competition, a pandemic resulting in much increased savings for the middle class due to WFH and less recreational spending outside, and IT companies riding this high wave in general.\n\nNone of these would apply to a hypothetical Xbox VR headset.",
            "I do think they kind of suck at gaming hardware, they focus solely on performance, making sure you can run games on 60fps in 4k, but ignoring every innovation in tech in the last few years. Their controllers feel great in the hand but are now several generations behind in features. Try playing GT7 on the PS5 with VR, Haptic Feedback, Adaptive Triggers, Gyro Steering and compare that to Forza on XBox with just basic controller vibrations. And then you still have more features packed into the Dual Sense like infrared sensors, touchpad, lightbar. Meanwhile Xbox controller still requires batteries.",
            "Still don't know but what OP wants will never happen. Not enough money to make I guess.",
            "Nothing is for certain until we see actual products or announcements. The speculation is there. But yes, Phil has been most vocal about third party stores and a mobile Xbox.",
            "EU may have other opinions",
            "That's true, but it doesn't seem like the games have sold well and that's what's really important. Sony seems to be saying they are scaling back their VR games. And games are where they make money. I doubt they are making any money on headset sales, just like Meta doesn't make money in headsets. Those are subsidized to get you into their ecosystem. Idk, I don't see any signs of the playstation VR ecosystem being a big financial win for Sony. I'd love to be proven wrong tho. I'm really glad that PlayStation VR exists.",
            "it's telling that those 2 games would almost double number of first party PSVR2 exclusives so far. Horizon, Grand Tourismo and RE7 (last 2 are just VR addons not made from the ground up for VR so maybe should count as 0.5 game).\n\nMeanwhile HMD development cost at this scale is in hundreds millions of dollars. Why would you do that if you could leverage PCVR or Quest 3 instead and just add VR mode to one of your games?",
            "Eh they sold 35 million units and it was generally well regarded by critics",
            "Good question! And I have an answer for you; according to publicly awailable data, Queat 2 had 6.3M montly active users out of approximately 15M sold units as of October 2022, so roughly a 1/3 monthly users. What's the retention number for XBox? Anyway, regardless of retention, can one really call a 6.3M montly users a small, niche market, in context of gaming?",
            "To some degree that's true for Xbox. The only reason I own a series S is because it was impossible to get my hands on a PS5 (or series X) due to the pandemic/supply chain issues at the time.",
            "PSVR has been sold at a profit since launch day according to Sony, so your assumption there would be incorrect.",
            "Two first-party exclusives per year is more first-party titles than the PS5 has gotten in the last 12 months.",
            "I was one of those 35 million. Got it on launch day no less. It was awful. Name me one good Kinect game? Or Kinect use? Or even anything remotely good about it?\n\nEdit: I\u2019ll go even further and say that Microsoft\u2019s instance on bundling Kinect with the Xbox one and the impact this had on its price is a major contributing factor to the mess Xbox is in right now - and I say this as someone who has a series x and has owned an Xbox from every generation.",
            "Apparently Xbox had ~120 million monthly active users as of December 2022. VR is indeed quite niche in the context of gaming.",
            "Oh I didn't know that. Well that's great news then.\n\nGoing back to the original point tho, I'd still say the sales numbers would be worse on Xbox tho given the disparity between the size of the user base for the last 2 generations of PlayStation vs the last 2 generations of Xbox tho. Maybe if VR games were also on in gamepass that could be incentive enough for a good number of people to try it.",
            "Not just niche. How many of those users are children without disposable income playing free games like Gorilla Tag or Pop One? Since game sales are the significant factor, the actual viable user base is a niche within a niche.",
            "This number can not be accurate. Publicly available sales figures state that only 25M units of Series S&X were sold by the end of 2023, there's no way they have 120M monthly users.",
            "Gorilla tag is actually making tons of money because they focus on children.  Children these days spend money on in-game cosmetics all the time.  What else are they going to do with all the money they get from b-day and xmas presents?\n\nWhereas adults from my generation almost never spend money on in-game cosmetics.",
            "Maybe Xbox users on PC are included in that number. I guess in that case there\u2019s no way to compare them.",
            "Xbox covers more than just the Series S&X - all the older Xbox version console users(and some PC users) are included in the active users on the platform.\n \n \nBut then, the leaked 6.3M monthly figure for the Quest platform wasn't just for Quest 2 users, but included Quest 1 users too(admittedly, those are estimated to only have sold to a million and a half, so likely only a few hundred thousand still active)."
