            "Can't activate Windows after reinstall\n\nI've bought a Samsung 990 Pro SSD and a new Windows 11 Pro key when I first got my G14. After recently finding out that Bitlocker was only using software encryption, I was forced to reinstall the OS again to enable hardware encryption. Now Windows claims it's unable to activate, even after manually typing in my own key because \"it looks like the hardware on this device has changed\" when it definitely hasn't. Now looking at the product key on the bottom of that settings page, it clearly seems to insist on using what seems like the original key that was preinstalled with my G14 which was for the Home edition and it's not letting me replace it with my Pro key due to the error message above.",

            "Simple question but.. way back when 3.1 and 95/98 were still in active use. People could use animated GIF for wallpaper and it'd work. Then Microsoft said no more and blocked that with XP I think. I recall hearing claim that animated GIF wallpaper on XP and later would be too demanding on CPU.\n\nToday's computer has enough power to emulate Pentium III and Windows XP yet we still can't use animated GIF or APNG for wallpaper without needing 3rd party program.\n\nWhat was the real reason Microsoft blocked the animated GIF in the first place?  And what would you suggest for animated wallpaper for W11? I want to use 2 different large GIFs (if you're familiar with trippy art from P Robertson, those GIFs!!) and have them stretched out on 2 monitors.",

Previous Windows did not require any key codes for the reset .\n\n2 - Do I need to skip the small part with letters and enter only the part with numbers, or it is a bug?",

Excel does not have any real alternative for a heavy user (and most users, like accountants, will never give up on Excel as they are too used to it - Microsoft can't even update or improve it much because the business users all scream and have tantrums when something changes).\n\nLinux also falls victim to having too many distros, with too many differences and developers pulling in different directions.

He\u2019s just a backseat gamer with a premium streaming service that I can't believe people pay for. I tried it for a month and it was a joke.\n\nSwitching to Linux isn\u2019t hard. I\u2019ve helped elderly folks, middle-aged people, and kids transition smoothly, with no more issues than they had on Windows. Linus Tech Tips videos are NOT proof that Linux is difficult for home users. Sure, there are challenges with gaming and proprietary software, but otherwise, Linux is an easy OS to use.\n\n**Seriously try it for yourself and tell me that it\u2019s extremely hard.**",
            "Fair enough, I hate that shit too.",
            "Scanning, printing, writing, email, netbank, image processing.. So yeah, not super heavy duty stuff, but enough to have issues with Windows. And then there's the privacy and telemetry part of it, which was what really drove her away.",
            "As a Windows and Mac user, and as someone preferring the latter - I still do not know which one to get. Is it Ubuntu, or Elementary OS, or Linux Mint, or Solus Budgie. I want to install something that is as close to Mac as possible and get up and running within a day.",
            "Agreed. I switched a laptop of mine that started being too weak for Windows to Linux Mint, and I haven't had much of a learning curve. Anything I don't know how to do (which has been about 5 times so far) I just google, and that's it.",

            "Thank you so much for the detailed response and shedding a lot of light on this matter! Appreciate your time.\n\nGlad to hear that AMD is plug and play for the most part, as that\u2019s what I am running these days. Not sure how 5950x with its 16 cores and 32 threads would work, is the scheduler up to the task to make the most out of it? Windows 10 struggle with such setup a bit, perhaps Linux would be more advanced/better optimized for higher core counts? I will do further research. Just wouldn\u2019t want to park cores to make things work, at least Windows 10 does try to load them up (though unevenly), but still better than disabling half of the CPU for stability. I felt it was a good long-term choice for a CPU, especially playing at high resolutions, so it\u2019s nice if I can take advantage of its raw power at least once in a while.",

Linux is just a kernel and honestly, I'd be impressed by the creativity required to make effective kernel level ads lmao. \n\n'Linux' in the sense of an OS is far too decentralized to effectively advertise, and the community (that builds the stuff, mind you) is so against that mind of bullshit they'd turn to an alternative for whatever software injected ads in a heartbeat. If a certain desktop environment, say GNOME for example, started putting actual ads (again, enabled by default and difficult/unsupported to remove) it would would be swapped out by 80% of users overnight.",

            "Nobody said they're competent, but they are tech savy and know more than average joe out there. Now imagine if luke and linus are incompetent, how are others going to feel going into linux? They'll pass.\n\nLinus deleted the enviroment because he did what every average joe would - clicked yes. He was installing through software manager on pop\\_os and got a warning that he's trying to install steam. Average joe will not know what he's trying to do, he will just press yes because \"if i press yes things usually get installed\".

I'm going to assume if there was a problem you solved it for them to set it up so ofcourse there was no friction point that they could run into.\n\nAnd yes, I agree that linux these days is very usable for average joe. Until they run into a problem and have to fix it themselves. Then you have the problem that luke pointed out in the video I linked in my first comment.\n\nI personally enjoy watching videos of people trying linux for the first time. Here's one of them. He ran into a problem because his gpu was not picked up and couldn't change refresh rate and resolution. Troubleshooting took him about 90 minutes (timestamped at 13:01).\n\n[https://youtu.be/8WkcLwXCFJQ?si=vYyySiOOPm3-cohz&t=781](https://youtu.be/8WkcLwXCFJQ?si=vYyySiOOPm3-cohz&t=781)\n\nThings these days have to **just work** out of the box. Microsoft provides that because most people are on one OS and they're used to it. Many things on linux work out of the box too, but winning people over is a huge challenge.",
            "I can recommend either [Debian Stable](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current-live/amd64/iso-hybrid). MX Linux (based on Debian) or Linux Mint (based on Ubuntu). \nElementary OS was a bit laggy for me and crashed frequently, which is why I can't recommend it as a daily driver.\n\nWhich distro you choose shouldn't make too much difference. The bigger difference will be which desktop environment you choose. Since you prefer Mac, I recommend a GNOME desktop environment, whereby you can then set up a \"Mac alike\" docking panel with the [Dash to Dock](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/).\n\nHowever, if you really like the Elementary OS interface, you can just use the [Pantheon](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pantheon). Desktop Environment and install it on your Operating System of your choice. \nIts also no problem to use several desktop environments on one OS, you can choose every time you log in. \n\nPersonally, I have been using Debian for years and have never had any major problems with it, recently I switched from GNOME to the KDE desktop, because it has a bit more configuration options and is more technical. However, if you simply want an \"Mac alike\" interface, GNOME is a great choice.",
            "Glad I was of any help. I'm afraid scheduler stuff is a bit out of my knowledge range, but perhaps asking on /r/linuxquestions or /r/linux4noobs might get the answers you need.\n\nAnd if you decide to give it a try doing a dual-boot setup is probably the way to go. To poke and prod around in an environment you won't be afraid to break or reset, and to figure out what you can carry over, and what you need to replace.",
            "Yeah dude teach me how Linux works, I clearly know nothing.\n\nYou're right, people would swap distros because the only ones using it right now know how to do that BUT IF they had the market share that Windows does they would not give a crap if 1% of their users left because of some ads, that's my whole point but you didn't read it.\n\nLinux enthusiasts are a tiny minority of the PC world, most people that use computers don't know shit about computers and just want to use it.",

They are all free and have subscription tier. It's clearly not the samething.\n\nAlso, I can't dismiss YouTube ads unless the timer allows it. These are clearly not the same, it doesn't stop you from doing anything nor interrupt you. Next thing, I guess office telling you you're licence isn't activated will be an ads next.

And because even although it would be mighty useful to many, many people if they were enabled automatically they need positive consent to be enabled. \n\nThis is 2024.

The whole system is an advertisement meant to shuffle you to the door of other paid services once they have you locked within their ecosystem. Back in the day, you use to buy a \"feature complete\" operating system but keys would run $100+. Now you can buy keys for sub-$10, if not free via an upgrade; Do you think it just got cheaper for them to produce the software? No, they just have other ways of recouping the lost licensing revenue. Thats where these in-app ads come in for OneDrive, Office 365 or third party tools like Antivirus.\n\nWindows 11 is Microsoft's tacit acknowledgement that the user is no longer their main revenue stream and therefor not their primary focus; You're the product now.\n\nThat all being said, theres nothing wrong with that, you do you; Just acknowledge thats whats happening and move on."
