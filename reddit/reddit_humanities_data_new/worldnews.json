            "Russia's air strike damages Ukrainian power facilities, injures two\n\n>KYIV, June 22 (Reuters) - Russia launched a new barrage of missiles and drones in an overnight attack on Ukraine on Saturday, damaging energy facilities in the southeast and west of the country and injuring at least two energy workers, Ukrainian officials said.\n\n>Ukraine's air defence shot down 12 of 16 missiles and all 13 drones launched by Russia in the second large strike this week, the air force said. The air alerts in Ukrainian regions lasted for several hours in the middle of the night.\n\n>National grid operator Ukrenergo said equipment at its facilities in Zaporizhzhia region in the southeast and Lviv region in the west were damaged by the strikes.\n\n>Two energy workers in the Zaporizhzhia region were wounded and taken to the hospital, it said.\n\n>Ivan Fedorov, Zaporizhzhia's governor, said the fire broke out at an energy infrastructure facility in the region and further damage assessment was underway as repair brigades and emergency workers dealt with the attack.\n\n>\"We can say for sure: the enemy will not stop. Ukraine needs air defence systems,\" Fedorov said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\n>Moscow has said its air strikes against the Ukrainian energy infrastructure were in retaliation for Ukrainian drone attacks on the Russian territory.\n\n>Lviv regional Governor Maksym Kozytskyi said 67 firefighters and 12 special vehicles were involved in putting out the fire in his region on Ukraine's Polish border. He said there were no casualties in the Lviv region.\n\n>Since March, Russian forces have intensified their bombardments of the Ukrainian power system, knocking out about half of the country's available generating capacity and causing a severe energy crunch.\n\n>Despite warm summer weather, Ukrainian cities face scheduled energy cutoffs and the country's electricity imports from its European neighbours are at record levels.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-downs-12-missiles-all-drones-launched-by-russia-new-attack-2024-06-22/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-downs-12-missiles-all-drones-launched-by-russia-new-attack-2024-06-22/)",

            "\nUkraine war briefing: \n\n>European Union countries have formally approved the launch of accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova next week,\u00a0another step in the two nations\u2019 long journey to join the 27-nation bloc. Belgium, which currently holds the EU presidency, said member states had agreed on a negotiating framework. Volodymyr Zelenskiy called the start of the accession talks a \u201chistoric step\u201d. \u201cMillions of Ukrainians, and indeed generations of our people, are realising their European dream,\u201d the Ukrainian president posted on X. \n\n>A Russian guided bomb killed two people and wounded three in a residential area of an eastern Ukrainian town, Donetsk regional prosecutors said. Five five-storey buildings and six homes were damaged by the bomb on Friday in Selydove, about 14km (nine miles) from the frontline, they said on Telegram. \n\n>The Ukrainian military said its drones struck four oil refineries, radar stations and other military objects in Russia\u00a0in an attack in the early hours of Friday.\u00a0\u201cUnmanned aerial vehicles attacked the Afipsky, Ilsky, Krasnodar and Astrakhan oil refineries,\u201d it said on Telegram. Russian emergency officials, writing on Telegram, confirmed three municipalities of Krasnodar came under \u201cmassive attack\u201d. The Russian journalist-run Astra social media channel reported that Yeysk, home to a military airfield, was hit by drones that sparked fires. Nasa satellite fire monitoring indicated fires or hotspots at the airbase. The Krasnodar region sits across the Kerch strait from Crimea. \n\n>Ukrainian drone attacks put two electricity substations out of action in Enerhodar, the town serving the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,\u00a0and cut power to most of its residents, Russian-installed officials said on Friday. An official at the Russian-occupied plant said it was unaffected. \n\n>Ukraine said it was dispatching reinforcements to Chasiv Yar, an embattled strategic hilltop town in the Donetsk region and a vital flashpoint whose capture could accelerate Russian advances deeper in the industrial territory. \n\n>The US will send the latest Patriot missiles \u201crolling off the production line\u201d to Ukraine instead of other countries that ordered them, the White House said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to reprioritise the deliveries of these exports,\u201d said John Kirby, the national security council spokesperson. It also applied to Nasams, another type of air defence missile. \u201cDeliveries of these missiles to other countries that are currently in the queue will have to be delayed,\u201d Kirby said, adding that deliveries to Taiwan and Israel would not be affected. \n\n>The Pentagon has given Ukraine approval to use US-supplied missiles to strike targets inside Russia across more than just the frontlines near north-eastern Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region\u00a0if acting in self-defence. \u201cIt makes sense for them to be able to do that,\u201d said Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary. \n\n>Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced measures to protect Ukraine\u2019s energy system,\u00a0including protection for power plants under Russian fire and the development of alternative and renewable energy sources. Drone and missile strikes have knocked out half of generating capacity since March, according to official figures. Attacks overnight into Thursday hit four regions and cut power to more than 218,000 consumers, the energy ministry said. \n\n>Three men have been arrested in Frankfurt, Germany, on suspicion of trying to collect information on a person from Ukraine\u00a0for a foreign intelligence agency, federal prosecutors said. They were identified as Robert A, a Ukrainian; Vardges I, an Armenian; and Arman S, a Russian. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/22/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskiy-hails-historic-step-as-eu-set-to-open-ukraine-accession-talks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/22/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskiy-hails-historic-step-as-eu-set-to-open-ukraine-accession-talks)",

But the Nazis were evil but they genuinely believed that Jewish and other minorities needed to be erased. Obviously, the Nazis will forever be the most vile and hateful political group of the last 100 years. Now, I will ask that you put yourself in the shoes of an ultra-nationalist conservative Russian who has the power to make real decisions based on intelligence you receive from the rest of the world, including your perceived \u201cenemies.\u201d\n\nI genuinely believe that Putin and other major political leaders in Russia believe that Ukraine legitimately belongs to them, either as a puppet, or as an outright enclave. Russia today is still an empire made up of dozens of different ethnic groups with their own national histories. One thing we know from history is empires view expansion as a means of national survival. They also believe the west has constructed a conspiracy to take their former spheres of influence away from them.\n\nMy example is Russia in the 80s. Reagan held an exercise called \u201cAble Archer\u201d in 1983. Russian intelligence began witnessing realistic coded messages and activity via surveillance and signals from the west. Heads of government from all NATO governments participated in the drill, which Russia had never seen before. In response to this, Andropov and senior military commanders began mobilizing for war by putting more nuclear and conventional units on standby in case this was the real thing. Again, Russia was seeing intense military activity with no warning to Russia. This all boiled to the point that an automated strike order was given to a Russian missile unit to usher in the apocalypse. The alarm went off three times.\n\nNow if this happened then, imagine you are Russia and your government officials fear societal collapse caused by the west? It doesn\u2019t make it true, but they absolutely are all drinking the same koolaid.",
            "I mean, one *could* argue that we knew Russia wouldn't like a Ukraine in NATO, and so talking about it would be a sort of diplomatic aggression.\n\nHowever, since Russia always lies and believe the West to be lying all the time (when NATO says Ukraine can't be in it because of reasons, Russia believes NATO wants to ascend Ukraine into it anyway since he believes NATO to be an offensive pact) there is literally no way to come to any diplomatic \"satisfaction\" for anyone.

I've said it frequently here that the hostages are just normal people who didn't ask for fame, and that's really important for everyone to remember. Many will fade into obscurity (like Ada Sagi who popped up earlier!) and they're allowed that.\n\nIt's really odd to go experience the worst thing that will ever happen to you on such a public scale, and when you finally come back to \"normal\" life (which, in reality, no longer exists), you're an international celebrity -- completely unbeknownst to you the last 8 months while you were in hell. It's not even comparable to celebrities who rise to stardom overnight, because they understood what they were getting into when they released the song or film, and, most importantly, *are famous for their own actions.* But that's not the case with the hostages. They're famous because of what other people did to them and that's really a weird place to be in. They have to deal with this on top of all the other trauma they already deal with, in addition to people they only marginally knew crawling out of the framework and everything else that is demanding their attention -- not to mention, you know, *recovering from such an ordeal.* \n\nIf you see these people, give them space.

            "Nothing major, but former hostage Ada Sagi appears to have [spoken to the media ](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hostage-freed-in-november-deal-says-she-was-held-in-a-gaza-hospital-before-release/)for the first time since her release. There's a handful of former hostages that when I see their name, I have to take a moment because I don't recognize their names due to how quiet they've been and she's one of them.\n\nThe two pieces of information I found the most significant are:\n\nThis is the first time I've heard of a release going wrong. Adi was moved and put in a van to be released, but then was taken to another location after \"something happened\" and she was held until 28 November. From her testimony, it appears that she was initially suppose to be on the first day of releases, 24 November. For those of you that don't recall, or weren't following, the ceasefire was initially only suppose to be for four days, meaning that Adi was almost not released at all. As we know, the deal was ultimately extended 3 times in the final hour, for the days of 28, 29, and 30 November.\n\nMaking this more significant, IMO, is the fact that there were *5* elderly women released on 24 Nov. that had \"no strings attached\" in the terms of their release, i.e. weren't required to be grouped with another hostage because they were kidnapped alone, or only with adult children or their husbands: Margalit Mozes, Adina Moshe, Yaffa Adar, Chana Katzir, and Chana Peri. Ruti Munder was also released on 24 Nov., but she was kidnapped with her adult daughter and grandson, so I suspect she was a \"strings attached\" hostage.\n\nI'm baffled by this. Very odd. It sounds like she was taken to the hospital where the Asher girls were held.\n\nThere's no one she could have reasonably been swapped for; every one of those women were from Niz Oz except for Chana Peri, but Chana Peri and her son, Nadav Popplewell, were held in the Nir Oz tunnel, so they more or less counted as Nir Oz under Hamas' holding patterns. It's not like when they swapped Maya Regev & Raaya Rotem, which, while never confirmed, was very obvious to me, personally. Margalit & Chana Peri have diabetes, and while Adina had recently had heart surgery, she spoke about how she knew how to manage it and was doing as well as could be expected in the tunnels (the guards liked her and gave her permission and space to do exercises and things like that to manage her health). Which is to say, it doesn't appear that they swapped her last minute due to someone's health worsening rapidly, a la Maya Regev. \n\nSecond to this, is much more minor -- and the headline of this article on other websites that posted it -- was Adi saying that she's lost faith in any peace. A lot of the dialogue in Israel at times has centered around the general political affiliations of the southern kibbutzim and if it shook any of their beliefs to the core. It does appear that it has for some.",

It's not too hard to connect. It is probably a random clip they found online and might not even be from Gaza for all we know. \n\nHamas would not let the Bibas kids see daylight and to be frank, we don't even know that the kids are still redheaded -- their father is a dark Mizrahi Jew (I seem to recall Yemenite) and kids change rapidly. \n\nAgain: asking questions is fine; arguing about it and spreading it as truth, or even a sincere possibility, is not okay. People are getting so obsessive over it the family will likely have to comment, which causes them pain for no reason. Even if you don't think it hurts, it does hurt.

According to the author, Hamas despised governing on its own in the Gaza strip, with anecdotal data in the article indicating that it was losing popularity among the Gazan population. Thus, it launched the attack with the aim of resetting the status quo with Israel. Essentially, they want to copy Hezbollah and the model they achieved in Lebanon. First, they want to survive this war so that they can declare victory (just like what Hezbollah did in 2006). Then, they want to engage in unity talks with Fatah so that they can join and reform the PLO. This way, they can return to power in the Gaza strip and continue launching attacks on Israel while leaving the burden of governing the Palestinian population to Fatah and other Palestinian factions, while still holding the future Palestinian government hostage, which is exactly what Hezbollah has done in Lebanon. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you think its an accurate detailing of what Hamas wants to achieve, or do you think its incorrect? If so, why?",

The Saudis were demanding that Israel take tangible and irreversible steps toward a two-state solution and that Washington enter into a formal security treaty with Riyadh; in exchange, the Saudis would formally recognize Israel. Most Palestinians likely saw progress on Palestinian statehood as a good thing, but not Hamas, which has always been dead set against a two-state solution and committed to Israel\u2019s destruction. Hamas also understood that under a two-state solution both sides would be expected to clamp down on their respective violent extremists, which would not bode well for Hamas and its allies.\n\nI don't think there is, or ever has been a Palestinian faction committed to a genuine and permanent two-state solution.

I took that as a reliable number of the actual number of dead hostages - from all causes: those who were indeed accidentally killed by the IDF (some were, admittedly), those who were murdered in captivity, those who were just dead bodies stolen on 7 October, and those who died from lack of adequate care in captivity - in Hamas hands. Which meant about fifty were still alive.\n\nMy guess: ten women (the five Nahal Oz girls + Carmel Gat, Romi Gonen, Emily Damari and less certainly Arbel Yahud and Doron Steinbrecher) and about forty men (almost all civilians, in their 20s to 60s). The elderly and those who had health issues that required medication are unfortunately unlikely to be still alive.

Waiting for the Spokesperson unit to get back to us.*\n\nOne of the few times I appreciated being a few hours behind in the West because it was hilarious to read with this foresight; the poor reporter stuck on Shabbat duty on this live feed was *baffled* and seemed to be questioning themselves and what they were seeing. Every update reeked of self-questioning, haha.\n\nA good friend of mine is a journalist at a well-respected Western syndicate and I asked them, albeit in regards to the hostages a few months ago, if they ever got heads up about these sort of thing.

            "I think Aviram Meir summed it up really good in the article on this note: he suspects that Almog will get there, but it's not currently on the table.\n\nI actually work in the Holocaust sphere and a lot of survivors didn't start speaking until decades later, often after retirement age. If you're interested in this topic, Richard Rashke wrote *Escape from Sobibor;* the most valuable part of the book, in my opinion, is not the actual book itself (sorry, Rashke) but where he wrote about what it was like working with each survivor. Each survivor he interviewed has a lengthy section in the back devoted to them and how they treated the interviews, Rashke, etc. Shlomo Szmajzner could be described as cycling through mania, Selma Wijnberg was very open about everything (she had already spoken in the past about having PTSD before PTSD really had a name); her husband, Chaim Engel, was shut down at certain parts (to which Selma teased him about it, haha). Toivi Blatt started off avoidant but came around, Alexander Pechersky was paranoid (he was interviewed in the USSR and had been jailed previously for talking about it, so I think it says more that he was willing vs the fact he was paranoid), I believe it was Kurt Thomas (never named, but obvious) that asked to be left alone, among many others.\n\nI imagine the returned hostages will all fall on this spectrum; we'll have the Selma's who, after a few decades, make peace with the trauma and speak about it. We'll have the Kurt's who want nothing to do with interviews and testimonies, the Chaim's that are in a dark psychological state where their trauma makes them feel guilty about their actions (Chaim murdered a SS guard during the revolt -- it was an open secret among survivors, I mean, 11-12 S.S. guards were killed that day by prisoners, he was not the only one) and Selma was the one who teased him until he admitted to it, with his name, to Rashke. We'll have the Shlomo's, who will speak with strong passion, but we realize we should probably leave them alone for their own mental health. It's a process.\n\nI think it was Esther Raab who disclosed to Rashke that the only reason she speaks is because they all promised each other, at the launch of the revolt, that the survivor's have to tell about what happened. She said she hates it and she struggles with severe PTSD after each talk she gives; Rashke wrote a play about that, too.\n\nI think it's worth noting that some people just don't want to talk about these things. They don't find any strength in speaking, they find strength in keeping it to themselves. If they keep it to themselves, they can keep it on their own terms, they don't have to deal with Hamas mouthpieces criticizing them (like what happened with Amit Sousanna). My elderly cousin was born in Germany in 1939 and getting information out of her is like pulling toenails. She just gave me permission this year to put in a missing person's request for her father and I've been working on wearing her down my entire life (I think the only reason she gave in is because her 14 y.o. grandson is now old enough to begin to comprehend everything and has become very invested about learning about his great-grandfather). It's a wild trip with no clear journey and it very well may take decades for some to speak, and I imagine it will only be a small fraction who do eventually. The ones speaking since their return are motivated to do so to help the rest, but once that is off the table, we may hear less and less.",

They get painted as these super far leftists, which is true in some cases for sure and makes up a good percentage, but a large percentage of them are also people who refuse to be chased out of places they want to live and that often aligns with the right.\n\nUnlike a lot of the West, Israelis don't tend to sit n a firm \"right\" vs \"left\" mindset, but rather, every person is unique and tends to pull ideas from multiple \"sides\" of the spectrum -- the way it used to be in a lot of countries.\n\nThe only reason it's notable in Adi's article is because she was an Arabic teacher as part of her peace activism, meaning she was a bit deeper into that activism than most others.\n\nETA: I'm a really big fan of the election maps on the \\*Hebrew\\* Wiki for the 2022 Elections, I think they help paint the picture:\n\n[here's the voting map for Likud](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Likud_%28ha%27Likud%29_electoral_support_in_the_elections_to_the_25th_Knesset.jpg) and you'll be shocked to see quite a bit of red in those southern Kibbutzim, particularly Alumim, but also the cities of Ofakim and Sderot (all of which were hit hard on 7 Oct), but you'll notice that every kibbutzim hit on 7 Oct had between 5-15% Likud voters.\n\nBut this is Israel, we literally have dozens of political parties, so some others i found notable:\n\n[Religious Zionism map ](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Religious_Zionism-Otzma_Yehudit_%28ha%27Tzionut_ha%27Datit-Otzma_Yehudit%29_electoral_support_in_the_elections_to_the_25th_Knesset.jpg)-- registers at 5-15% depending on the kibbutz\n\n[Shas](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Shas_electoral_support_in_the_elections_to_the_25th_Knesset.jpg)\n\nAnd of course, [the full map. ](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Political_profiling_of_the_statistical_areas_in_the_elections_to_the_25th_Knesset.jpg)\n\nWhat's fascinating about this map is that all of the kibbutzim that were heavily effected on 7 Oct, were so split politically they are colored \"no dominant political party\": Nahal Oz, Kerem Shalom, Holit, Ein HaBesor, Sufa, Urim, Kfar Aza, Mefalsim, Nir Am, Netiv Ha'Asara.\n\nAlumim  & Shlomit are straight up on the right.

Not, \"this random Twitter accounted shared a video with two red haired children, so this must be Ariel and Kfir\". Again, asking about it okay, but claiming it as fact is when things get rough. \n\nI think most people, even if this line is hard to define with words, have a good gut feeling of when they are dancing around it. I wake up to DM's from people every day that say things like, \"I noticed xyz and was curious but it felt wrong to post it publicly\" and that's kind of what I'm getting at. We're only human to think about these things, but once we share it, there's nothing stopping our comments from ending up in a viral TikTok video, Tweet, or DailyMail article and getting back to the families and hurting them in the process.",

This video came from an unverified random twitter user and is not actually the Bibas kids, just people claiming the two kids are Ariel and Kfir. The same way that people in that tweet were claiming that the Bibas family announced the deaths of Kfir, Ariel, and Shiri -- it never happened. Only Hamas said that.\n\nTalking about \"if the kids see the daylight\" like I wrote, is based on the testimonies of returned hostages and their experiences in captivity and comes from an official source, including the IDF.\n\nIt is worth noting that there will always be discourse when someone is in the news and that's to be expected; talking about if you believe the Hamas announcement, for example, is expected discourse and is within the realm of what we expect as families.\n\nWhat is out of bounds is when people believe random twitter users and create falsehoods (like \"The Bibas family confirmed the deaths of Shiri, Kfir, and Ariel\") and repeating it ad nauseam without fact checking themselves. I wrote this post specifically because someone in a different sub was very insistent on the fact that this video was absolutely Kfir and Ariel and wouldn't take anyone's opinions otherwise. That's when this veered from a gray area in the \"discourse/discussion\" category and went right into disrespectful. A few months ago I saw a thread where people were guessing which hostages, by name, they suspected were pregnant and were arguing with anyone who tried to tell them otherwise and that also falls into this category -- I see this sort of thing a lot.\n\nIt's a thin line that is hard to find words for, but is pretty obvious in action and when you read it or see it and I think many people have often had a gut instinct on when they're close to the line.\n\nETA: And as someone who saw a bunch of wild things about my relative on the internet, while I only speak for myself personally and not for other families, much less the entirely of my own family, obviously, I never minded people asking for information about something they saw and/or people proving why something was fake and related discourse. It's when people got rude and stubborn (and not just \"oh I disagree\" but more like \"no, this is real because that isn't true!\") that felt like a gut punch.

But, as you can also tell, there's another guy in this photo wearing the almost exact shirt. \n\nI'm sure, per usual, the Israeli and Nepalese governments know more than we do in this regard (perhaps the other blue shirt guy survived and vouched for himself, or something like that). \n\nBut also, as I mentioned, \"brown man wearing light blue t-shirt with blood on it\" is probably a description that fits dozens of men on 7 Oct. I think his family insisted somewhere \"he always wears slides like that!\" but again, lol, so do a lot of brown men, including Israelis. \n\nI think it's probably him; Wall Street Journal claimed that the IDF says its him, but I haven't seen that announcement from the IDF anywhere, so I can't vouch for it 100%.",

            "I'm the one that wrote initially about the theory of the pods Hamas is making with groups of three, and swapping out one to make them an other in each group. With that being said, we already do know that certain groups aren't subjected to the pod theory: about 16 people from Nir Oz were held together in a tunnel, plus those from Nirim. \n\nWhat is worth noting is that the remnants of that group of 16 from Nir Oz, after the November release, was Chaim Peri, Nadav Popllewell, Yoram Metzger, Amiran Cooper, Oded Lifshitz, Alex Dancyg, Itzik Elgarat. \n\nHamas claimed all men listed above, except for Nadv and Oded, were killed in March. Hamas announced Nadav's death in May.\n\nIn early June, the IDF confirmed the deaths of Yoram, Amiran, Nadav, and Chaim. I've been saying its reasonable to fear for the safety of Alex and Itzik. Oded's family has been saying since the winter that they believe he is long deceased; his wife was one of the women released in October and none of them believe he could make it this long without his medication, and Hamas' failure to mention him at all this entire time is supportive of this. We know he was alive in October, but likely not in good shape. \n\nHope that helps -- the tl;dr is that these men were never part of these pods to start with, for whatever Hamas logic applies here.",

Don't get me wrong -- obviously they're not being kept anywhere close to the proper conditions for a POW -- but that severely complicates their status. And, of course, raises the price Hamas wants for them.\n\nI really don't believe we'll see a deal, or at least not anytime in the near future, so I don't pay them any mind.\n\nHamas held Gilad Shalit for 5 years before we got to an agreement (and it was a terrible one); Hamas has held another Israeli civilian since 2014 and another one since 2015, and proved that the latter was alive as recently as 2022.

I often wonder how many of the deaths would have been avoided if it had been just about any other sort of event, or how many were due to people who were impaired and didn't make the best judgements as a result. You can see hints of it in some of the stories, too -- i.e. in Mia Schem's testimony, it stuck out to me that she said that Elia (Toledano) tossed her the keys to *his* car and she drove.\n\nThere were also a lot of car crashes -- i.e. Idan Shtivi was going at such a high speed that he flipped his car over \\*and\\* hit a tree, killing everyone in the vehicle (he's allegedly alive, but I'm not particularly convinced). Autopsies revealed that all the occupants in Idan's car were killed in the crash, not by the bullets after (Hamas later evidently found them and sprayed them with bullets). Obviously, \"fleeing the largest scale terrorist attack in human history\" is enough to crash someone's car and no doubt, but a huge part of me can't help but think that subtances (alcohol or otherwise) played a part for at least some people, too.\n\nAnother one I suspect is the case: Keshet Casarotti-Kalfa was found inside the vehicle of Motti Zoherman. The two didn't know each other at all (Keshet was 21, Motti, 74). Keshet's best friend was Shani Louk, and he was at Nova with her and Ori\u00f3n. It seems like Motti stumbled across a panicking kid who got separated from his friends, panicking out of his mind (which may not have involved drugs at all) and tried his best. They're one of the ones that hurt the most for me, too, because they made it to Sderot. There were only a few squads of terrorists in Sderot and they unfortunately stumbled upon them.

The IDF has dropped pamphlets advertising this, which includes full color photos of all hostages, including Kfir and Ariel).\n\nPlus, we know the IDF knows where the majority of hostages are and are just waiting for the conditions to be right in order to pull the trigger. They admitted they have dozens of rescue plans that Yamam are practicing daily and just waiting for Shin Bet to pull the trigger.\n\nIf Kfir and Ariel were being held in public, the Yamam would have been on that so fast your brain would hurt.",

            "The Israel Museum, or the Israeli government itself, could probably open an exhibit with all the cursed selfies (and related images) from 7 Oct. Another cursed one off the top of my head is [Gal & Guy Gilboa-Dalal at Nova](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjdn3h36p) minutes before Hamas landed. I've seen a bunch of them but I'm drawing blanks right now.\n\nThe funniest one I have -- I'd share it but I'm not completely sure it was shared publicly or if it ended up in my feed bc they're friends of friends -- was of two guys hiding at Nova, juxtaposed with a selfie they took on the 11th, in their army greens, and the text translates to something like, \"Hamas chased us around Nova for hours with guns and failed; now it's our turn to chase Hamas around Gaza with guns...\"\n\nSimilar to this, if you remember Avigayil Idan, her father was killed photographing Hamas' hang-glider contraptions, probably while he was trying to comprehend what the heck he was seeing. I don't think people realize, when they hear that story, that Hamas had been sending things across the boarder for years. Kites with explosives attached was their fave, so I presume that's what Roi Idan thought he was seeing until he was able to see the photos on his camera screen after he took them with zoom, if he made it long enough to do that.\n\nWith that being said, Bipin Joshi had apparently only been in Israel for < 3 weeks, so it's possible that's true for most of these men and this was their first tzeva adom. They were certainly drilled on it, made to practice, took a class or two about it and what to do, so it was probably pretty funny/exciting when it finally happened; that resulting in a silly selfie like this would make a lot of sense to me. I'm Israeli and did internships in Israel during the summers in college, but I attended an American university; I distinctively remember signing a contract right after Protective Edge that outlined everything to do in a tzeva adom and also told me that I would be expelled if I went further south than Rehovot, haha. It's been spicy since \\~2019 or so again with the rockets, so I think these men likely had a lot of preparation as a consequence due to their location.\n\nTo (finally) answer your question: I don't think there has ever been exact information on the people who are in that photo and their fates. According to The Guardian, [10 Nepalese students were killed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/20/i-was-helpless-nepali-survivors-of-hamas-attack-in-israel-haunted-by-trauma) at kibbutz Alumim. The man interviewed in this article mentions Bipin Joshi being with him, so we can presume he's one of the men in the selfie. He mentions two dying by gunshot: Ganesh Kumar Nepali and Dipeshraj Bista, so I think it's safe to assume they're in that selfie. The article mentions two other men by name, however, there were certainly multiple barracks for foreign workers and students, so it's not clear if they're in this photo or if they were in a different dorm and bunker. \n\nIf you wanted to explore [kibbutz Alumim on this website](https://oct7map.com/BipinJoshi) you can get a better idea. Most of the deaths at Alumim were foreign workers. I'm obsessed with this website and the developers are improving it daily, so I imagine eventually we may get photos of enough of them to figure out the fates of those in the \"bunker selfie\".",
            "No problem!! The pods, IMO, are rampant, but we still are seeing exceptions; the big exceptions I remember released hostages saying were the Nir Oz tunnel and a room in one of the hospitals (that also seemed to be exclusively Nir Oz; we know who 7 of the 13 people there were, and they were the Cunio-Aloni family (Sharon, David, Yuli and Emma) and Doron Asher-Katz, Aviv & Raz).\n\nWe can presume the Nir Oz hospital holding room was disbanded and it's unclear where the men were taken. Tammy Metzger mentioned that David Cunio was moved through the tunnel they were in (Yarden Bibas apparently had a breakdown when Hamas let him stop for a visit -- reportedly the two are best friends -- but wouldn't let him stay there. Yarden apparently even offered to share his mattress and food with David and Hamas denied it).\n\nThere have been some exceptions: a lot of the released November hostages weren't held with other people until right before their release; Dafna & Ella Elyakim and Mia Schem come to mind in particular as people who were held alone until the last week or two. We also know that Noa now was held alone for some time, and I'm sure we'll learn eventually.\n\nThe pods still do seem to be holding strong, as the rescue from last week showed, but there are still exceptions -- I think the exceptions are part of the reason the pods stick out to me so much, honestly, because these pods are so consistent for a large portion of people, but then there's a few groups of outliers and I'm not sure what to make of it at all.\n\nQuick ETA: the one outlier to the pod theory that I just thought of, is the case of Omer Shem-Tov and Itai & Maya Regev. The three weren't held together, but were held close enough that Hamas made Itai go hold his sister down when she was screaming in pain during a dressing change. Itai said something like, he was having a hard time being able to hear her in pain and not knowing what was happening to her when he could hear her, and between that and Hamas wanting her to shut up, they made Itai go help. \n\nWith that being said, it's within the realm of possibility that there was a 3rd person with Omer and Itai and that they just weren't mentioned, which would mean pod theory is holding strong.",

But this time, since the Gaza conflict started, the skirmishes are resulting in significant human casualties, property destruction, evacuations, etc. and the drums of war are gradually getting louder increasing the chance of a full blown conflict. Perhaps Israel sees this as the best opportunity to rid itself of Iran's proxy Hezbollah (who are only growing in strength and capability). Israel is already in \"war mode\" because of the Gaza situation and are sick and tired of Iran's bullshit. So if cooler heads don't prevail, it will only take a spark to ignite an all out war.\n\nI personally believe that the Gaza conflict is a Palestinian/Israeli fight.

We've been down the \"Palestinian Support\" road before with the PLO and it only lead to Lebanon's 15 year Civil War in 1975.

            "Damn man, I'm an Australian with mixed heritage, part of that being Lebanese. \n\n\nAnd I have to say that it's super disheartening to see that people share this sentiment about members of my culture seemingly failing to integrate into society somehow, or otherwise only mixing with their own as you put it. \n\n\nI'm sure there has been plenty of causes for this type of racial denigration to have embedded itself as the commonly shared view of Lebanese immigrants and I won't bother attempting to argue against it, as ultimately that is not the intent of my message here. \n\n\nWhat I'd like to convey is that I hope you understand how much it sucks to be told that type of thing (we only mix with our own or we've failed to assimilate to the Australian way of life so to speak). My grandparents immigrated here from Lebanon in the late 50's, worked damn hard to establish a home for the family, made many a friend of every race or creed along the way and always made sure to drill into our heads that we were blessed to be living in this country and that we had much to owe to Australia which had become their new home. \n\n\nMy father and his siblings were raised in Redfern, where my grandparents were eventually able to set themselves up running a small convenience store for many years, while my father, my aunt's and uncles all grew up proud of our cultural heritage but ingrained and invested into the culture of the Australian society. My dad played footie for the Rabbitohs and despite copping his fair share of racism on the field, he only ever saw it as the price of admission to play a sport he loved with friends, teammates, fans and hero's all the bigger part of the experience, allowing him to make earnest and heartfelt connections with many of the people he met on that journey. \n\n\nHe'd often laugh and recount how back in those days, the Lebanese people found an unlikely kinship with the Aboriginal community, with whom they bonded over a shared disdain for their heritage amongst a larger part of the community at the time. I grew up calling many Aboriginal friends of the family either aunt or uncle as a result. \n\n\nTwo generations on and although I've never even set foot in Lebanon, you can be sure that \"being a Leb\" is the typecast role I find myself shoehorned into by default when it comes time pass judgement on my character without the due diligence of getting to know me as a human. \n\n\nAlthough I remain indifferent as a product of the society in which I was raised, with no experience of the culture abroad, particularly absent any time spent in Lebanon, nonetheless it is difficult to be confronted with the assertion that I'm not really a true member of Australian society due to my ethnic heritage. \n\n\nAnd whilst I'm proud of that heritage, embracing the beauty of its history and complexity of its traditions, I would be remiss to ignore the fact that should I ever visit Lebanon, neither my friends or family there would consider me Lebanese - simply put they'd classify me as Australian, as that is where I was born and raised and is the country I call home. \n\n\nSo, I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that despite your views or beliefs on where Lebanese immigrants or their descendants fit within society in Sydney or even Australia as a whole, it's kind of tough living a life just trying to embrace the culture I've grown up in and just wanting to be seen as me and nothing but. I'd love to tell you that I don't get selected for a random search going through an airport every single time - so much so that I'm truly starting to question whether it actually should be considered random - however I find it more important to tell you that, guess what? I get it! I'm not even mad, as if it constitutes the safety of my fellow countrymen, what is there to question? \n\n\nBut even then, you'll never truly know how much it saddens me to see the distrust I'm met with in everyday interactions. How embarrassing it would be to correct the misinformation weaved into my standard WASP friend's impersonation of a Lebo, or how confronting it is to come to terms with the fact that these same people don't share your own fervent curiosity in the nuanced approach to learning new things about different cultures. You'll never know the sting that I feel every time I'm not afforded the time of day or consideration simply due to the physical traits I exhibit that one would be correctly inclined to associate with a part of my familial history having originated in a particular foreign place. \n\n\nAnd yet, I don't seek your pity. I don't seek a sorry, a slight shift in how swiftly the stereotype secludes me from certain social settings, nor do I care for any unauthentic judgement of myself as a person beyond the constraints of age, race or creed. \n\n\nAll I can hope for is that by reading this, perhaps you can understand my place in life a little bit more and how it isn't easy to be seen as something I had no say in... In failing that, I am happy to forgo further attempts to have you relate and would be content just to let you know that I'm trying. I'm doing my best to be a part of this wonderful country and the society we live amongst, the culture we cultivate and the beliefs we have for what it means to be an Australian.

            "> Ukraine and Israel are different situations\n\nI'm pretty sure your problem, and the other people that don't support Israel's right to self defense, is that one's full of Jews and the other isn't.",

Therefore we are legitimate.\" - Menachem Begin\n\nFYI, again, the fact the US **government** said it would support Israel in case of a war is all that truly matters from the outside world",
            "The drama. The moral grandstanding. You get off on this.",
            "The children of people who support Hamas who would do far worse to Israel if they could. Who demonstrated just that. Who hide behind innocent bystanders and launch attacks from hospitals and schools. So again I ask you, whose children are more important here? An evil man holds a strangers child hostage while shooting at your own. Are you going to prioritize their safety over your childs? Only a fool would say yes.",
            "You and your Hamas friends really thought Israel would just sit down and take what happened on October 7th lol. Shouldn't you be making your parents proud by protesting at a university that you weren't even accepted to?",
            "I think the side that is the victim of assault should be prioritized but I completely agree with you in regards to the numbers. I think the response has been atrociously disproportionate. It's a disgusting tragedy that no one should be happy about. But Hamas and Hezbollah continue to hide behind innocent civilians while targeting the children of Israel. What would you do if it were your children but to wage war?",
            "Good point. They were also well educated and had a good standard of living. Is it really oppression that drives terrorism?",
            "Yes it is still very multifactorial.",
            "Indeed. Regarding myanmar, the violence insnt driven by budhist beliefs , but by nationalism. You don\u2019t hear them screaming Buddha akbar. You don\u2019t see mothers cheering for their martyr sons there.",

            "No wait, let\u2019s do this metaphor but let\u2019s make it accurate. Let\u2019s say a guy killed someone\u2019s kid and then fled into a school and locked himself inside with 300 kids including your own. Instead of trying to root the guy out, the police just shoot the school up, killing the criminal, but also massacring every child inside. Your child is now dead. Are you okay with that because they were a \u201chuman shield\u201d?",
            "I wouldn\u2019t make 300 more parents feel the pain of losing their children to avenge the pain of losing my child. Because I\u2019m not a genocidal monster. Israel is. This isn\u2019t a complex moral situation. If Israel wants to end anti-Israeli terrorism the answer isn\u2019t to murder tens of thousands of innocents leaving a generation of orphans who all have a grudge against the genocidal occupiers who murdered their parents. If they actually cared about protecting their people, they\u2019d address the true cause of the violence: The nearly one hundred year occupation of a sovereign people and the prison camp in which they trapped those people after ethnically cleansing them from their homes.",

But, if you think you can gleem the entirety of a persons knowledge about a complex situation from just a couple sentences that have no way to provide context, then you are being very dismissive of the wonderful sonderous nature of humanity, in thus particular instance. It is likely the case that you do, in general, give the benefit of the doubt to folk, we must apply that online as well if civil discussions are to yield fruitful results.\n\nOne way is to ask genuine, earnest clarifying questions, instead of responding with dismissive momemtum.",

No one would even dare suggest it for fear of being shouted down. The US lost 3 soldiers in Jordan and unleashed a multiday bombing campaign and even violated the sovereignty of Iraq to kill an Iranian militia leader just driving down the road in Baghdad.\n\nIf not listening to antisemites loses Biden the election maybe the Democrats shouldn't have cultivated an attitude of antisemitism among their base.",
