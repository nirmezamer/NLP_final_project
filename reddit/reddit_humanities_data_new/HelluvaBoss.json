            "Hi everyone! I'm the Spindlehorse executive assistant and I hope you enjoyed the episode. On a personal level I think it has the best facial animation out of the show so far, ESPECIALLY in that last scene.\n\nAnd don't worry about another break. Remember that next episode is coming in June and is my personal favorite of the season.",

            "* FINALLY we can hear Stolitz's First Time in Forever duet without screaming! Tho it sounds a lot different than from the con audio. Not that I'm complaining\n* Surprised to know the Cherubs make their return here, I was expecting Masterminds. Hm.\n* WHY TF DOES BLITZ HAVE A MOXXIE PLUSHIE IN THE SEX CHEST?!!!\n* They forgot to sing the Imagination Song to open the portal! Booo. 0/10\n* I do wonder why the portal opened specifically in the Lust Ring instead of Pride?\n* There's something weirdly cute about Blitz wanting tonight to be perfect and even knowing all the things he likes in bed... little does he know :(\n* AHHHHH FIZZ CALLED BLITZ BUDDY! They really have come a long way since Oops. So proud of them.\n* COCO AND APPLE ARE BACK\n* Okay the fact Stolas was tempted to get in bed with Blitz but quickly shot it down...\n* Yk I was surprised to see most of the episode centered around the Cherubs instead of Blitz and Stolas then I thought it made a little sense since the episode is called Full Moon and Blitz doesn't see Stolas until night so we're kinda focused on him prepping with the Cherubs being tossed in\n* Can we start a \"Brandon Rogers doing a great job voicing Blitz's emotional moments\" compilation pls?\n* GUYS! GUYS! THE CHANDELIER FROM WHEN THEY WERE KIDS CAME BACK AT THE ENDING\n\nHonestly this episode was a little weird when we got to the Cherubs trying to kill Blitz. I mean I sorta get it because the episode starts at morning and it was established Blitz wants to try something different and the Cherubs just so happened to get involved. But at the same time, I dunno, it just felt a bit jumbled? Not bad tho",

Actually, most of scenes with the cherubs were pretty funny.\n\nThe ending though made me tear up a bit.",

My only complaints were I was a little disappointed that after all this time and them saying it was \"extra special\" it was 23 minutes, with more than half of it being the B plot.\n\nI don't really understand the decision to make Stolas and Blitz basically the side plot, haha.",
            "They\u2019re both idiots.\n\nStolas wouldn\u2019t let Blitz\u00f8 process everything or give him chance to truly talk about their feelings. Instead he assumed the worse and dismissed him and what he was saying.\n\nAnd Blitz\u00f8 started going on the offence, attacking Stolas. He let his bad experiences control his thoughts and emotions. Just like Stolas, he assumed the worst about it all.\n\nThey both NEED to talk to each other. \n\nBut as sad as I am for both of them, I kinda knew their relationship would get worse before it gets better (even before the second trailer was released). So they probably will get back together eventually, especially since there is a moment where Blitz\u00f8 saves Stolas. It\u2019s just a matter of waiting.",

This is the second time he's basically told Stolas he feels inadequate over the power imbalance, and Stolas didn't get it and took it literally. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nInteresting how the roles have reversed here. At first, it was Stolas who wanted to talk and Blitz wouldn't let him. Now, it was Blitz who was willing to hash things out and Stolas was too upset.",

            "When Blitzo says \"I can always do better\" it just kills me... He nods and smiles in this sudden fawning reaction, which is such an unexpected thing to see from a character who never wants to suck up to anybody. I love Stolas but he really put Blitzo through the panic of thinking he was being rejected for not being good enough and then dumped a truckload of feelings on him right after. Blitzo shouldn't have blown up on him like he did but watching the range of emotions Blitzo goes through in this scene, it unfortunately makes perfect sense aaauuuuggghhhhh\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8pxr92xy0u3d1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c26a2ee656f1e3cb732e7583be4722716dc8ec6",

            "I like that even though Stolas has recognized the power imbalance and is trying to fix that, he's still not really seeing things clearly. Like, he's a romantic, and I think that temporarily blinded him to how Blitz is/how Blitz would react. Telling a fucked up person you love them doesn't suddenly make them not fucked up. It takes time and mess and work to get someone to trust you like that, but Stolas was hoping for a fairytale.",
            "So anyone else notice that Stolas stored the crystal and later the Grimoire between the two books he showed Blitz the first time they met as children?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t4k65vhs3t3d1.png?width=1847&format=png&auto=webp&s=3393d1c007e15a3478b9ddeb4c8107af5665e650",
            "Damn. \n\nI expected their fight to last longer and go deeper, but it was still big. Blitz thinking Stolas isn't serious, Stolas thinking Blitz is making fun of him, and Blitz being mad that Stolas just sprang emotions on him? I didn't expect that. \n\nThis was a MASSIVE flaw in miscommunication.\n\n- Stolas should not have started by asking for the book, permanently, right away. That already put Blitz's hackles up.\n- Stolas should have perhaps been a bit more direct about what he wanted, or asked Blitz if he was willing to come over without needing the book. \n- Blitz's self hatred really took hold here. He was so determined to think it was a joke that he hurt Stolas's feelings. \n- Stolas not realizing Blitz feels used and under Stolas's power. \n- But Stolas's crying - Blitz needed to see that. I don't think he fully realized Stolas's true emotions until that. And now he has to find a way to apologize since Stolas wouldn't let him. What a shame. \n\nI did not expect the Cherubs or the Agents to take up so much of the episode, and I wish they'd been the B plot. But MASSIVE kudos to the IMP crew. They made sure Blitz made it to that meeting safely. Loona getting hit so many times on the arm was a bit concerning, though. \n\nI wonder how Blitz is going to explain to them that he doesn't have the book anymore. I don't think he's going to hide what happened very well. Poor Stolas is gonna cry his heart out and drink way too much.",

            "My expectations for Blitzo were low enough that I was pleasantly surprised at how he handled the situation at the end. Like in a \u2018huh, thought that was going to be worse!\u2019 kind of way.",

            "It was okay tbh. I wish Stolas and Blitz\u00f8 had more time together here, the end was absolutely beautiful and emotional, and I wish there were more moments \u2014 them being taken up by the Cherubs is disappointing to me. The song was great, but Stolas and Blitz basically being a side-plot rather than the main focus of an already really short episode was pretty\u2026 disappointing to me. I still liked it, just wish it was either longer or focused more on Stolitz",
            "How can it just end like that???",
            "The pacing of this episode to me was everything S2 E4 Western energy tried to be, but better. The action sequence didn't feel out of place, the sub-plot was relevant to the main plot and vice versa, and the whole time you could tell that it's not gonna end the best in terms of Stolitz.\n\nTalking about \\*that\\* scene, it was done with extreme detail and humanity of it all, and it didn't feel out of place. There were no jokes to make the audience laugh, but the jokes made by Blitz were used to show just how difficult the situation was/is. Basicly everything the characters did makes sense, and there are very few shows in the world, if any to be honest, that are able to tackle a similar theme with such grace and respect.\n\nThat said:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yrtgf1m8bu3d1.png?width=2325&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5e08612c97956e2bc5f4d376978159ab3445a6f",
            "Ok, WTF! I knew blitz was denser than osmium, but come on dude. In the final moment where Stolas says he thinks highly of him, that's when he realizes something?! He broke Stolas' heart!\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/kjvp21mmrs3d1.gif",
            "maybe controversial opinion but i feel that Stolas was in the wrong. should have given Blitz more time to decide.",
            "Why was all of Stolas furniture covered by sheets, is he moving away, is this why his house looks completely different in the trailer?\n\nBut he also said in the song he \"won't dwell on the divorce\" so why would he be moving away?",
            "We have Loona's voice back, and the gang kicking some asses, plus more character development for Stolas. Worth the wait.",
            "I quite enjoyed the world building!!! Stuff like that takes time, but mapped out the stores and technology. Hazbin can\u2019t take us everywhere. We could have gotten a 13 minute relationship themed episode, but I like the gang spying on Blitz this time around.",

And that *Step on Me* store had to be a reference to [that Loona video on YouTube.](https://youtu.be/YXPGQf-sX6I?si=U6oTbEaIZ_KNtiVR)\n\n\nAlso, I'm sad the bird and the red guy don't want to do the gay together anymore.\u00a0",
            "I'm glad Vivzie had the IMP staff take care of the cherubs on their own. Not only is it funny that Blitz\u00f8 never realized he was in danger, but it lets his part in the episode focus on the inevitable conclusion with Stolas.",
            "After spending 20 minutes staring out of the window in silence and then deciding to go get some tacos, I gave it a second viewing and it is SOOOO much better on the re-watch!  I promise you, guys!  If you were initially disappointed, felt that it was rushed, or that the CHERUB B-plot was forced in, give it a second go.  It flows so much better and I loved the CHERUB/IMP rematch!  Moxxie, Millie, and Loona were amazing, as always, and seeing them fight as a team to protect Blitzo was my second favorite part of the episode!\n\nBrandon and Bryce's performance was incredible.  That moment where we watch Stolas' heart break is just . . . I don't think there's anything I can say that hasn't already been said.  \n\nI know people may be a little weirded out with the B-plot but this episode delivered and I think it just claimed my 3rd favorite episode spot!  Gonna need to give it a 3rd watch to be sure, but it's safe to say that this was worth the wait!  Hopefully, I can patch my heart up in time for Apology Tour.  \n\nAnother certified hit from Spindle Horse!",
            "For me the sex jokes are justified because they have context( Blitz is preparing to bed with Stolas) and Stolas make Blitz realize that it's not always about sex so for me they're not so exaggerated",

            "That ending was heartbreaking but the Loona fursuit had me fucking rolling!!!",
            "My head canon is that Loona, Moxxie and Millie followed Blitz not only to make sure he didn\u2019t fuck up their meal ticket, but because they all ship them and want them to be happy together.",
            "So after only hearing about Blitzo's history of sabatoging his relationships when he realizes they've gotten too deep for his liking...it was kind of refreshing to actually see it happen on screen.\n\nNot only did his inferiority complex make him blind to the fact that Stolas thought he was worthy of love...he then goes even further and actually insults Stolas and hurts his feelings.\n\nAnd it looks like this is the first time he actually realized what he had done.",
            "I wasn't expecting the Cherubs to be the b plot. I was hoping there wouldn't be a b plot, and we could get some quality time with Stolas and Blitz talking things out. It felt a bit rushed, all crammed in at the end. I'd have liked even just 10 more seconds at the end to get Blitz' reaction to it all. Nothing seemed \"extra special\" about the episode to me. The b plot ruined it as far as my feelings go for a first viewing. I tend to like episodes more after rewatching them a few times, so we'll see if that holds true again. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.",
            "oh that ending is just so perfect because it encapsulates so much about their relationship, with stolas being real about his feelings but still accidentally controlling the conversation because he\u2019s assuming too much and blitz acting on defense and regretting it afterwards because he knows how it usually goes for him when he does that.",
            "They both made their mistakes in that argument. Stolas did not give Blitz anytime to process what the hell was going on, and Blitz in Blitz fashion blew up as a defense mechanism. I think what really hurts for me is when Blitz begs Stolas, saying stuff like \"I can do better\" when he thinks he's being disposed of.",
            "I am in such pain right now",
            "This episode was simply amazing. Truth Seekers level. Loona was amazing too. Stolas' last line killed me.",
            "Realising that Blitz and Stolas were having the argument that would end their relationship (for now) in front of the same chandelier they had their first real magical moment together under hit like a truck, holy shit.",

            "The A plot was mwuah, wonderful. Wouldn't change a thing about it. Stolas' character has come extremely far and the sheer amount of courage he had to do what he did to Blitz is extremely brave yet painful. I can understand the things he did because I have had to do them myself. He's maturing.\n\nThe B plot however? The B plot takes away a bit too much from the A plot. Once the Cherubs arrive in Hell, nothing is exactly accomplished. Nothing IMPORTANT happens at all. They come in, they fight, and then they get booted out. It doesn't have any effect on the A plot. I feel like the parts with the Cherubs should have ended once they come to agree with working with the DHORKS and they present their equipment to them. After that? Perhaps they could have done something like the other members of I.M.P helping Blitz find things for his plans with Stolas, much like how he even turns to Fizz for help.",

            "Honestly, I'm disappointed. It was going to be about Stolitz, but it turned out to be about cherubs... And we've been waiting for 7 months for just 23 minutes? I was ready to die, but it was just five minutes of them interacting.",

            "I see a lot of people mostly talking about how Stolas feels and how hurt Stolas was-- and don't get me wrong, I love Stolas and I think he did fantastic in this episode, and absolutely what Blitz did hurt him-- but I think Blitz had a point. This was all sprung on him and he didn't have time to formulate a response. It wasn't right of Stolas to make an assumption so quickly, though understandable when Blitz did... well what he did immediately after the confession.   \n  \nI think it would have been much healthier if Stolas had just stopped him and said, \"This is how I honestly feel. Let's put a pin in this, take some time to process, and talk again when our thoughts are clear.\" Or even better if he'd given him some kind of warning that he wanted to have a serious talk beforehand.  \n  \nI don't think Stolas did anything overtly wrong, I just think the conflict could have been mitigated if Blitz hadn't been caught off guard- not to mention his head filled with self-doubt, he went there thinking he had to prove himself and his advances were rejected, he wasn't in the right mindset to begin with.",
            "It was so hard to watch Blitz showing Stolas all the sex toys while Stolas just sat quietly waiting for him to finish \ud83d\ude2d",
            "Good episode, but Cherubs felt way too forced in and acomplished almost nothing outside giving us a peek at what D.O.R.K.S are up to. I did like Blitz and Stolas moment at end tho.",
            "Unpopular opinion but I did not like this episode. The best part, as assumed, eas the ending, but even that it was like 6 minutes. When vivzipop said it was an extra special episode I thought it was be longer? Over half of the episode was for a b plot that frankly, should have in another episode with the alouded time. Not the one dedicated to an emotional breakup in a long standing relationship that's issues were being set from the beginning. We could have spent time following stolas along with blitz as we set up. We could hear briefly from Octavia, set up her plot later in the show. \n\nMy best thing I can say? \n\nThe ending was immaculate. It was paced perfectly, the backtrack was beautifull. The acting was stunning. They feel so in character. I don't think they should has extended it. It was genuinely everything I wanted and needed from this episode. They prep amazingly for the next episode and I am genuinely so excited yo see what comes next.\n\n2hen it comes to humor, I think the angles were amazing and it was well done.\n\nI want to also thank vivzipop for taking time with the music because it feels the most well done aside from 2-7\n\nAlso. \n\nBlitz trying to say sorry at the end just made me so, so sad. \n\n\nThis is honestly the harshest episode review I have typed but it is just my personal taste. Congrats the everyone who worked on this, it was nearly a ter jerker.",
            "The ending was so sad...bro.\n\nThe whole thing with the Cherubs getting their asses kicked by the rest of IMP was pretty cool.",
            "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xopawnjzct3d1.jpeg?width=302&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c08244f1c12c7ed063c8971ad7867f8de35f8c80",
            "I love how the Stolas/Blitz argument at the end didn't have any of the \"misunderstanding\" tropes, but a more realistic misunderstanding based on how the characters are portrayed. Things like how Stolas opening with the book thing was, from his perspective, probably the best way to start the conversation with Blitz. Not knowing that doing that would be one of the worst ways to actually open that with Blitz. Then with Blitz reacting with fear about losing two of the few important things in his life and misunderstanding why Stolas would want the book back. Thankfully Stolas was able to reexplain what he meant with the crystal, but again Blitz's characterization led him to simi-deliberately misinterpret what Stolas was saying with the role-play angle. Which leads back into Stolas's characterization misinterpreting Blitz's reaction and everything goes down from there. \n\nI wonder how the I.M.P. team will respond to this mess. They said they were following Blitz to make sure he didn't mess up their business so it isn't out of the realm of possibility they followed him all the way to Stolas's palace and saw at least the bedroom scene. I feel like there are two ways they can react to the situation, if they observed it. One possibility is that none of them really care or do anything. M&M and Loona could just shrug their shoulders and say \"Well we have the crystal, so we don't need the book. We aren't getting involved in your dumpster fire of a love life.\" The other, and likely more interesting possibility is that they try and help. Something like Moxxie making true on his agreement to be a better friend and become fine from the Acid Trip. Perhaps he and Millie try to help Blitz with relationship advice. Loona doesn't have much in the way of words of wisdom, but she would likely try and help in some form. Someone else in this thread said that they wanted to see Fizz and Ozzie help Stolas and Blitz since they are a foil to their relationship, which I agree would be nice. \n\nI am going to predict something with the CHERUBs. I think Colin is going to be the \"good guy antagonist.\" Cletus and Keenie are obviously on their way to fully losing their cherub/heaven status and are either woefully ignorant to actual morality like much of heaven seems to be, or are intentionally using the story of \"everything we do is for the good of these humans\" to be bad guys since they get to act without oversight now. Colin is clearly the one with the most reservations about doing actually bad things, and isn't on board with the other two's antics. I imagine either he becomes either a double agent in a \"I'm with the bad guys, but I know they are wrong so I'm doing the right thing anyway.\" form, or he turns at a crucial moment to do something good, like letting the I.M.P. go to save some humans, or backstabbing the other CHERUBs. Either way I hope he gets to go back to heaven at the end while Cletus and Keenie get some comeuppance.",
            "Weird pacing but I loved it. \n\nI was afraid of Blitz and Stolas falling out over a typical \"Just talk!\" miscommunication, but they really knocked it out of the park. It wasn't miscommunication but something deeper and just as mutual. They both come from deeply injured places, but very different deeply injured places, and each others' defense mechanisms (especially Blitz's) kept anything from really getting through. \n\nStolas saw the situation more clearly and wanted to deal with it more directly, but he was so turned in on himself after analyzing and overanalyzing the situation that he didn't consider that Blitz might not have been in any position to make that decision or even completely process the question like he was. And obviously Blitz has such a catastrophic inferiority complex and is so reflexively defensive he had to be bashed in the head repeatedly for the message that Stolas might actually care for him outside of a transactional relationship could get through. The thought never crossed his mind because he couldn't let himself believe it. \n\nIt's beautifully complex in its tragedy and not just two characters talking past each other.",
            "Blitz was probably so tense. Between Verosika, Fizz, and likewise in his life, Blitz has been used, abused, passed over, and forgotten by family and loved ones.\u00a0\n\n\nHe didn't go see Stolas in the hospital because of what happened to Fizz. Likewise he feels he ruined his sister's life, so he spiraled. His entire encounter with Stolas was based off childhood nostalgia and a moment of deceit too.\u00a0\n\n\nThen...well you know.\u00a0\n\n\nHis entire business was born and formed via his transactional relationship with Stolas. His financial security, his found family of coworkers, and so on.\n\n\nLet alone Imp history and prejudice.\n\n\nStolas is lonely, stuck in an abusive relationship that diminished him before his peers. He cheated on his wife. He has drug problems. He sexualized Blitz even if Blitz played into it some. Far past any comfort. To the detriment of his relationship with Octavia. And ultimately while he broke the law, Stolas' efforts to make Blitz care just feel weak.\n\n\nHe made the foundation of a relationship that could be healthy but because Blitz couldn't parse it, and couldn't evaluate his own feelings and thoughts instantly, Stolas condemned him. Literally did something Blitz never saw coming and pulled the rug on him.\n\n\nSure, shitty\u00a0on Blitz for being dense but he was also in DENIAL. Loona made him fear Stolas was casting him aside too.",
            "I remember Viv said that this episode was delayed because of the songs, which made everyone believe that there would be more songs than just the opening. However, I think she was referring to the songs in the NEXT episode, \"Apology Tour.\" There will definitely be more songs in that one based on the trailer and what we can infer from all of it. Also, Brandon Rogers (the voice of Blitz) made a comment months ago that the idea was for Apology Tour to basically be released not too long after \"The Full Moon.\" We already know that \"Apology Tour\" is supposed to come out in the upcoming month, but I think we won't have to wait too long for it. Maybe two weeks at most. That's just my prediction.",

Idk how to explain it but the characters don\u2019t seem like themselves\u2026 I also thought the breakup only filling 7 out of the 23 minutes was kinda weird considering that\u2019s what most ppl wanted to see the most. I\u2019m not a huge fan of the DHORKS or the CHERUBS so it was kinda disappointing to see most of the episode be in my opinion just filler. For such a pivotal moment of the show be only 7 minutes was surprising though credit where credit is due I don\u2019t think you could\u2019ve added more emotion into those 7 if you tried. Overall pretty good episode (I mean it can\u2019t be bad if Loona has speaking roles let\u2019s be honest) just a little disappointed on how short the breakup was.",

Just that moment of blitz running his mouth a little too much leading to the most heartbreaking scene of stolas thinking blitz doesn't care and thinks poorly of him. That stung because the same happens all the time in real relationships, someone in a panicked mode can say shit they don't mean especially if they're afraid of losing the other person and inadvertently driving them off. \n\n10/10 new favourite episode",

LET'S GO!\"\n\nThe way Stolas flinches at the word \"bitch\" hurts my heart so much. He definitely has heard every vile in name in the book from Stella before, it just made him curl into himself hearing that from Blitz. The person he loved and wanted to have a real relationship with but is calling him that...Like damn. Teleporting Blitz out makes even more sense with that little detail in there",
            "Listen I liked the episode. And the last 5 minutes were simply stellar. But I am a bit disappointed that this was mainly a cherub episode. They're fun and all, but in my opinion their first episode was one of the weakest in the series, if not the weakest, and it irked me a bit that so much of this episode was centered around them. I just do not care for them that much. I thought maybe their teamup with dohrks would lead to a much bigger and more important threat, but it really didn't.\n\nI'm sure it wouldn't have been that bad as another separate episode, as a breather from all the drama or something. But for an episode with this name and thumbnail, at this point in the story, which was so incredibly hyped, and even delayed, making a point that they were polishing everything until the last moment, I just honestly expected it to be a bit longer than it was, and so much more exclusively centered around Stolitz. Again those last 5 minutes were incredible, but it feels like the episode should have been much more centered around that, and to leave the cherubs for another time.",

            "I don't understand the people blaming Blitz. Or Stolas. \n\nNo one is wrong. No one is right either. \n\nThey're literally operating on two different wavelengths because they have entirely different upbringings and entirely different worldviews. Blitz literally CAN'T imagine a world where someone just cares about him and isn't using him. His reaction makes complete sense when you realize he's never been the CENTER of someone's world. Most people experience this at least when you're a kid, if you have parents who care, then you are the most important person to them. Or if you have a sibling, or some other family. Or a best friend. Or a child of your own who looks up to you. Lots of places you can find this. Blitz has never had it, and thus when he grew up, he had gotten used to this, and isn't going to let himself believe it because that's worse than just never having it. \n\nMeanwhile Stolas comes from a place where he has had infinite responsibilities and expectations from a very young age. Everyone around HIM demands things from him. Everything is transactional all the time. He's never had to navigate anything OUTSIDE of those types of relationships. But he tries too because he doesn't really want his relationships to look like that. The problem is while he can figure this out with Octavia, who is growing up with similar expectations and in a similar social class - he doesn't understand how to do it with Blitz. And Blitz himself doesn't know how to communicate that, and he likely doesn't think Stolas would care anyway. \n\nTheir relationship tells a good story because of this conflict but just because there's a conflict doesn't mean anyone is to blame. Sometimes it's literally two people trying their best with the cards they're dealt and sometimes you accidentally hurt other people just because you don't understand what they need. Not even you don't give them what they need. Clearly Blitz and Stolas DO give each other what they need, they just don't understand what that is.",

And this episode got dangerously close to that point.\n\nBlitz is his own worst enemy. He\u2019s always shocked when the consequences of his actions come back to bite him in the ass. His line in the trailer/a later episode about everyone being shitty because they live in hell is just him, as my stepdad would say: \u201cRationalize until [he] feels good, then quit.\u201d Not everyone in Hell is shitty. Charlie, Moxxie, (despite my dislike of her) Sally May, Millie, Octavia, Bee, Ozzie, Lucifer, Millie\u2019s parents(whose only act of \u201cbeing shitty\u201d was saying Moxxie was a wimp, which is an accurate description of him), Rosie, and Sir Pentious(who may I remind you got into Heaven.)\n\nAnd don\u2019t think Stolas is blameless. After all, it takes two to tango. We the audience know he loves Blitz as more than just a fuck buddy, but this is the first time he\u2019s ever told Blitz(or as far as I can remember).  He\u2019s always been flirting with him or asking for him to do something, like be a body guard or help find his runaway daughter. It\u2019s no wonder Blitz feels manipulated, when every interaction they\u2019ve had has had some sort of sexual undertone. I\u2019d say needs to go to Hell for being a self righteous prick, but he lives there. So instead he can go build a bridge, and **jump off it!**\n\nBut they obviously do have feelings for each other, and I fucking hate how much I want them to make up.\n\nBut on a much more positive note, I really did enjoy the subplot(?) with the Cherubs and DHORKS. The fight between M&M&L and the cherubs was another banger action scene.\n\n9/10: Stop playing with the audience\u2019s emotions\nViv.",

            "This result is so PAINFULLY realistic to BOTH of their character flaws. Let me explain.\n\nStolas has NEVER been in a loving relationship. He has NEVER had to confront an equal/partnered love or care. He's only ever had his daughter which is naturally going to be an imbalanced relationship of father and daughter.\n\nStolas' only experience with a partner has been one that has actually primed him for emotional isolation. He had no feelings for her, was forced to marry her, and ended up resenting her. This has left Stolas very much \"in his own head\" so to speak.\n\nSome people might see what Stolas did as a \"good\" thing. I mean, he confronted the physical barrier of their transaction then emotionally opened up to blitz. That's communication, right? WRONG.\n\nStolas emotionally dumped himself onto Blitz. Their relationship was imbalanced in a different way, one in which Blitz was always vulnerable on a physical and financial level to Stolas' emotions. This is why he has NEVER been able to be vulnerable to Stolas like he wants, and coupled with his raging feelings of inferiority and defensive nature, he had no tools nor understanding of HOW to approach his feelings, hence why he always avoided them and focused on the sex.\n\nAnd Stolas just didn't take the time to understand that. He doesn't know how. He was so wrapped up in how he was feeling, how he wanted things to be, he didn't give himself or blitz the patience to break down the barriers. And funny enough, Blitz DID become vulnerable.\n\nBlitz realized what stolas was saying, but the confrontational method Stolas chose to drop it on him left him disoriented. He disrupted his expectations without warning, then demanded a response. And blitz gave it. He told Stolas about his inferiority, but did so through confrontational language to match Stolas' confrontational actions. Just as those actions hurt blitz, blitz hurt stolas with his words, comparing him to other princes and denying Stolas' love as Stolas denied Blitz's agency as a partner.\n\nIn a way, Stolas didn't care about Blitz's emotions like he thought he did. He cared about HIS OWN emotions, and how his lack of understanding of Blitz made him uncomfortable. He does not understand mutual communication, and for someone who is hurt SPECIFICALLY like Blitz is that is incredibly uncomfortable. I think this episode really put Stolas in the hot seat for being too focused on himself and his obsession, and I hope that the two of them can talk it out in another episode where Stolas realizes he didn't give Blitz a chance to process like he did, and that Blitz IS reluctant to take down his barriers at all which was A PART of the fuel of Stolas' anxiety.\n\nVery realistic outcome and definitely interested in how the next few episodes handle this. ironically enough this isn't a guaranteed relationship killer despite Stolas saying decisions were made.",
            "I really do love this episode through and through. That conversation at the end was so heartbreaking to witness, with Biltz constantly misjudging his relationships, and it truly backfired on him badly. I commend Stolas for still giving him an Asmodeus crystal so he can travel to and from Earth, but man, I was nervously waiting for this conversation and now I am sad.\n\n\n\nI think the rest of the episode was a banger though. Having the agents and Cherubs team-up is a really great choice, and having Moxxie, Millie and Loona tag-team like this is a KoF tournament is fantastic, love how capable everyone is here, with their strengths played out great and their weaknesses making sense. The animation feels even better somehow, maybe it's due to me not watching HB since the last one. \n\n\nCan't really think of any complaints personally. This episode was a sucker punch but one that is needed.",

            "Review:\n\n* This episode is good!\n* But - it could've been great. I have two primary nitpicks for this episode. First, the Cherub sideplot could've been shorter with more focus being put on Blitz besides just his \"haha sex\" errands simply just due to this being the big, breakup episode, but okay, they weren't abysmal or anything. (Probably would've been better as their own episode's main plot though) Second - Despite the breakup scene being generally good to great-ish, i disliked how Blitz was utilitized. I can understand why they did it, but him constantly interrupting Stolas' emonional monologues with his usual quips just felt a bit off. If they toned down Blitz a bit, the scene would be exponentionally more impactful, and his final rage even more surprising.\n* Millie and Loona got hurt. Sadly, due to the show's history, it's probably safe to assume that we will never ever hear about these wounds, which basically just undercut the scene because we already know that nobody is in any actual danger.\n* Loona finally talked! Great to see that she is a character again.\n* Song in the start was nice\n* The pacing was great\n\nGreat to see the show continuing in it's path back towards late S1 quality. It's not there just yet, but it could be very soon.",

            "This episode was brilliant, but it also gave us some insight into the more villainous parts of the coming series. I mean, in the months, maybe even over a year, since S1E6, the Dhorks have built this *huge* force to take out the demons. And with the Cherubs helping now, it's going to be *hell* to pay. And since they can get into hell now, what if, say, Striker or Crimson found these guys going around hell and decide to 'help' them to get what *they* want. And since goals align, Striker and Crimson could definitely feign 'innocence' and offer help to stop those rogue demons upsetting the order. And that'd definitely be something Stella would go with in order to get back at Stolas (probably a plan from her brother where Stolas is caught for giving the book off to Blitz and use that to get him into trouble, get everything she wanted, all that). So we have a great pathway into a 'villain partnership' since we have all the antagonists against the protagonists. \n\nAlso, Fizz's new outfit is *adorable* and I'm so happy that he and Blitz are chill again. Also that whole scene just made me die with laughter because of just how absurd it was. \n\nAnd the ending is *so* heartbreaking. And the brilliant battle as a quick leadup and quick change just gave me an emotional whiplash, and I loved it. The team did an amazing job and it was well worth the wait!",

            "I'm a bit mixed, honestly. I feel like this was such a pivotal episode for Stolitz, considering everything leading up to this episode and the song released a few months back, but most of it was focused on the Cherubs and the agents, and narratively they didn't add much, not even showing themselves to be a future threat or force a character moment on the other IMPs that would justify their inclusion.\n\nBut the actual Stolitz moments were great. Blitz going around buying toys was endearing especially when he goes to Fizz, and the season buildup to the final scene of the episode was carried out really well. It seems they still have trouble communicating, but maybe now they'll be more honest with each other. I just wish this scene was spread out even more.\n\nAnd all of this episode was pretty to look at. Highlight for me was that moment where Moxxie first shoots at the Cherub and comes into the frame, that part looks like a wallpaper.\n\nSide note, this is the first time in a while we've heard Loona talk?

            "Absolutely obsessed with this episode!\n\nThe duet! The angsty break-up! I'm looking forward to see how this relationship pans out in future episodes so I can overanalyze the dialogue choices.\n\nThe animation was amazing for this episode. Stolas' visual emotional rollercoaster from happy bubble baths to hiding in the fridge, Biltz\u00f8's lip curls to show his emotional avoidance, and even the fight scene with the Cherubs was done with love!\n\nEDIT: The instrumentals during Stoliz's break-up-- the piano strumming in particular-- was also so well timed with the animation! Again, obsessed. \n\nLoved Blitz\u00f8's first and final outfit-- he felt and looked a lot more vulnerable and open this episode.\n\nEDIT: OH AND Blitz\u00f8's rekindled friendship with Fizz!!!!!! And Fizz looking healthier and happier than ever. The character work was so moving this episode.\n\nThe expressions were also so so good! The glints in the eyes, the gestures-- AND THE VOICE ACTING AH! Also, didn't know Stolas' 2nd pair of eyes could cry like that T-T\n\nI'm noticing a lot of comments about the A/B plot structure. I just watched all of HB for the first time this week, and honestly the episode felt consistent with the structure of the series. The main plot (Stolitz imo) was always secondary, so I would have been surprised if there was an entire episode focused around their relationship. The 8-9 mins felt like a beautiful gift.\n\nPlus if Stolitz had more screen time together, it would basically be resolving the relationship within the same episode. This episode was great because their time was short together. Tensions are high, emotions are high. More screen time could have compromised that. Personally am pleased with the pacing of relationship to the structure of the overall show!\n\nIn terms of the Cherubs/DHORKS section of the episode, imo this felt like foreshadowing for a larger plot involving the growing awareness of demons on earth, so not filler at all! The Cherubs aren't my favorite characters-- I'm more interested in their thematic representation in the show tbh. But watching how the Cherubs 'survive' on earth, observing their moral ambiguity, and witnessing their clear ignorance of hell versus heaven was great narrative work for the universe. So there was a lot to appreciate!\n\nOverall, loving and appreciating VivziePop right now. Can't wait for the next episode!",
            "Absolutely loved this episode\n\nhere's my hot take: While the B plot was admittedly a bit long, I think the stolitz meeting being squeezed into the last 5 minutes actually made it hit much harder with how sudden it all was. Dedicating a larger portion of the episode probably would've lessened its impact somewhat (IMO)\n\nOther than that I don't have much to say that hasn't already been said ad infinitum so here's this frame of Stolas with wet hair that I really like  \n(he's so fuckin' cute I wanna hug himmmm)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iqpi9mwoju3d1.jpeg?width=1081&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54b4160ec3693b37075e772a8a8e01fa2bcc383f",
            "I liked it very much. I think its one of the best episodes, actually. Definitely top 3 in S2.\n\n\nIf it has action it wins me over. The action secenes in this series are very good. Loona speaks and has some character development, Blitz is actually nice to everybody. Loona haters malding, Loona lovers melting because she was nice, supportive and capable. I totally expected her to jump Blitz again.\n\n\nHowever:\n\n\nSong was mid and was too long.\n\n\nBarely anything happened in the first half.\n\n\nHumans actually know about demons? Interesting but kinda changes the whole concept about secrecy.\n\n\nMillie is still underdeveloped\n\n\nStolas acted a bit weird and was really cold and it was a bit out of character imo\n\n\n8/10.",
            "I'm 100% in Blitz's corner, Stolas utterly failed at communicating what he wanted. It's clear he didn't really listen to what Blitz said when he tried to invite him in after their night at Ozzie's. Blitz thinks this relationship is only about sex, he thinks sex is the only aspect of it that Stolas cares about, of course he's going to be defensive and assume Stolas is joking.",
            "I'm crying with Stolas, it was so sad",
            "Am I the only one a little worried about all of Stolas furniture and stuff being covered in sheets?",

I just wish they integrated the Just Look My Way video into the episode itself, it\u2019s such a perfect song and the video itself is a masterpiece. But the episode\u2026 holy fuck, 100% one of my favorites in the entire shiw",
            "I wasn\u2019t expecting to feel so much from this episode. I don\u2019t really like Stolitz because I hate the \u201cnever say what they mean/purposeful misunderstanding\u201d trope, it\u2019s just frustrating. But the emotion that the entire team put behind the production really came through. This was a really good episode and beautifully animated. \n\nAnd I really love the friendship between Blitz and Fizz. I truly love seeing that. Some people had theories that in Apology Tour Blitz might push too hard to make amends with Fizz and end up pushing him away instead, but I hope that won\u2019t be the case and based on their dynamic from this episode I feel like it won\u2019t be. They\u2019re a very nice friendship so far, Blitz needs a real, not toxic friendship.",
            "I\u2019m usually on the fence with this show but I liked this episode! \n\u2014\nNot a huge fan of the B-Plot but it was still interesting!\n\u2014\nThen when Blitz and Stolas interacted it hit home for me, despite the different circumstances, Blitz trying to pretend everything is the same at first while Stolas just sits there quietly REALLY got me, it was similar an irl event of mine. I got a pit in a stomach and I don\u2019t even like that pairing very much lol.\n\u2014\nI do hope this isn\u2019t something that is resolved next episode, it will be interesting to see how this all turns out and how the others will react to having the crystal now (since Loona seems to like using the book I can\u2019t spell)",
            "I'm with most here that I am pretty surprised that the Cherubs took up a lot of the time. I think that's due to maybe mostly marketing the episode. I really loved a lot of the cherub and DHORKS stuff but I was surprised to it not being more of the episode of Blitz and Stolas' talk. \n\nBut when we got there it was GOOOOD. Loved the audio of the whole scene made it really feel tense and important. I feel so bad for them man \ud83d\ude2d",
            "The bit at the start of the final scene where you could see had been waiting in dread all day. That is some good animation.\n\nWeird thing but when Blitzo gets teleported out does he have the crystal on him I didn't see it but maybe he put it in his pocket.",
            "Man this episode was just a Rollercoaster of emotions. It was hilarious the whole loona calling blitz just to admit she is red flag hit it and quit it type of gal. Then the cheerubs not mentally handling the depravity of hell only to smack us with a hammer about Stolas relationship",
            "i must say the entire chrub part was kinda lame, i feel like this episode could be just 5 minutes long focused on Blitzo and Stolas break up.\n\n\nDorks and Cherubs returns should have been a dedicated episode on their own, make a big ass action sequences with comedy on it, like the IMPS are doing their job on earth and are surrounded be the Cherubs and drks.\n\n\nthe entire episode we got depends way to much of the final scene between Blitzo and Stolas and forget to have a better begnning and middle.",
            "Me: **Sees the D.H.O.R.K.S. agents and C.H.E.R.U.B angels being idiots and thinks 'Huh...not as sad as an episode as I was expecting...maybe things will be okay...'**\n\nAlso me: **\\*Curled up on my bed sobbing my eyes out.\\***",
            "I truly thought it was going to end with stolas and blitz being all like let's take a little time to think on this but that twist was so just sad and painful yet seems true to both of there characters I kinda hope they give eachother a shot later on though",
            "The massive funding increase for the DHORKS scares the living shit out of me. *Especially* if this is happening more-or-less contemporary with the Battle of Charlie's Hotel and its aftermath. It makes me feel like these series are going to end with the actual Battle of Armageddon and the destruction of all three realms, or at least narrowly averting it.\n\nAn actual war between the US government and the hellspawn (and their deadly sins)? I can't even imagine the consequences.",
            "Call me crazy, but the conclusion of this episode was what needed to happen long ago. It devastated Stolas but it was the closure his already tormented mind needed. \n\nAnd it was the lesson Blitz needed desperately to learn.",

            "I loved the episodes. Such a heart-wrencher. I wish for the best for Stolas, Blitz\u00f8, and Collin too. Collin needs a better group.",
            "This is one I hope I like more on a rewatch because it felt just okay for the most part. Maybe it's because it really wasn't what I expected and I feel like I was waiting for them to get on with the Stolas and Blitz stuff already.\n\nBut said Stolas and Blitz stuff was definitely worth it. Mannn the end hits hard. It's always been obvious to me that those two are gonna 100% get together properly eventually and work through their issues but *man* is it gonna take some work. \n\nThe animation was fantastic. It kind of felt more cinematic. \n\nGetting a bit of Fizz was a nice surprise\n\nI liked seeing it more obviously played up that Collin is the actually good natured Cherub and the others take advantage of him. I hope at some point he gets away from those two and gets to go on his own path.",
            "I laughed and cried so much. I watched the new episode 7 times and I gotta say overall the animation is 100000 times better. Y'all killed it. I can't wait for more",
            "Man, they went right for the jugular with the first episode didn't they?\n\nBlitz and Stolas miscommunication having consequences due to their respective issues, Blitz believing nobody would be that nice and loving towards him, and Stolas not really understanding how deep those issues run.\n\nIt gives rise to a little question in my head, how well does Stolas actually know Blitz? In OOPS, he does mention he doesn't actually know why Fizz and Blitz hate each other, in Ozzies he doesn't know how Blitz's business really operates or even his wine preferences, hell, does he know Blitz has a horse thing?\n\nIn fairness, Blitz doesn't really seem to know much outside of sexual matters about Stolas.\n\nPersonally, I hope this season gives both of them a break, maybe the opportunity to actually start again, Blitz learns not everyone he knows is against or using him, and Stolas learns how to actually communicate with Blitz, losing that filter about Blitz he's had since he was a kid.",
            "I'll be honest, I was *not* expecting the DHORKS or Cherubs to show up in this episode whatsoever. I expected them in either Ghostfuckers or Mastermind. So seeing them crop up right out of the gate was a surprise and a half. I *am* glad that I correctly guessed that they were in the mech suits, though.\n\nSo a few thoughts:\n\nFirstly, Cletus claiming he and his friends were 'exorcists' made me laugh. The Dhorks legitimately bought that and I just couldn't stop myself from laughing.\n\nSecond, the Dhorks think Blitz's name is 'peanuthead' now. This is hilarious and I am going to be amused as hell when they get corrected on this.\n\nThird, the fight scene was *awesome*. I found it truly odd that the IMP gang decided to shadow Blitz, something I don't think they've ever done on one of his full moon nights with Stolas before. I loved seeing them fighting the Cherubs in Hell. I was surprised to see the Cherubs didn't change in appearance at first, but then I remembered that Charlie didn't either when she went up to Heaven, so I think it might require them to actually become legit fallen angels or to be killed first. But the fight was great. I loved how Loona apparently heard about how bad the Cherubs lost in season 1 from Blitz and M&M, because her comment to them otherwise would make no sense.\n\nFourth, On the subject of Loona, we learned a bit more about her disguise. I always assumed it didn't change anything but her outward appearance and that it was more an optical and tactile illusion. But apparently this is *not* the case as she was able to use it to change to a more human body mass, making her narrower and harder for Collin to hit with his weaponry. At first I thought she was losing height. But that doesn't seem like the case. She's taking on a narrower build, but not losing her overall height. Her tail also seems to legitimately be gone in this form, which makes for a *very* interesting development, as it was at risk of being hit when Collin was peppering her hiding space, possibly moreso than the rest of her body at that point. The fact that she retains her demonic senses in this form makes for a neat little bit of contrast, and now I'm curious if this is also the case with Stolas as well.\n\nFifth, the DHORKS apparently were validated enough by the video footage they got of the team in season one that they got some *insane* funding and their tech is all over the place here. Makes me wonder who they might have captured, if they have demon holding cells that work. And how did they figure out how to open the portal to Hell and not end up being discovered?\n\nFinally, the end with Blitz and Stolas. Holy *shit* these two need to learn how to communicate better. Now to be fair, Loona kinda helped mess things up here, even if she thought Stolas was genuinely trying to ditch Blitz. But when Stolas offers him the crystal, it seems to confirm all of Blitz's worst fears. He wasn't wrong about needing the book (as he had no idea about Stolas snagging the crystal for him yet), but he also seemed to *like* the idea of the book giving him a reason to meet with Stolas, a kind of way to indulge his feelings for him without having to *deal* with them. So when Stolas is basically trying to create a genuine relationship, he's got the right idea but the execution and timing was *Godawful.* Basically info-dumping all of this on Blitz at the same time he's swapping out the book for the Crystal and making it look to Blitz like he's doing what Loona guessed and being passive-aggressive about 'breaking up' with him. So of course Blitz takes it badly, and when he tries to figure out how to respond, he kinda goes full motormouth, basically stream of consciousness, and is *not* thinking clearly, which doesn't help, and Stolas ends up feeling completely crushed. If these two were to actually sit down and try to discuss things, I feel like these two could seriously benefit from some genuine discussion at this point.\n\nBut given all that, I can't say it was a bad episode. And the trailer makes it clear we're getting *another* episode with the DHORKS (possibly in October or November, and I'm betting on November) so I'm anxious to see where that goes, and how the Crystal will work with the entire team, as well as whether or not it will give them disguises now.",
            "I just have one question for the cast and crew.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uq50yqykpx3d1.jpeg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92c3fc2356218acccb0b30f9555dda41d41f6897",

            "I mean if anything this episode showed us what we've known for a long time, neither of them is really good for the other one in their current states.  \n  \nStolas claims to love Bliz, and maybe he does, but he absolutely does not listen to him in this episode and that's kind of important for a partner. He wants the relationship to be serious and not a contract and yeah thats a good thing but also hes done little to no actual work laying the foundation for that kind of relationship outside of some very passive poking at the idea that Bliz clearly never responded to. Expecting Blitz to know that he was serious when this was basically out of the blue for him is nonsense and not listening to Blitz is a major red flag.   \n  \nBlitz on the other hand we know really has some past trauma and does not handle serious relationships well. Some of his abandonment issues are probably starting to heal now that hes got his friendship with Fiz back but that's a pebble in an ocean probably. It's not really anybodys responsibility to fix that for him, not Stolas certainly, but hes been actively running from doing so which is kind of the problem. He would rather try to live vicariously and join a healthy relationship others have than try to fix himself. Hes right to be angry with Stolas but he handles himself poorly when expressing that. Not that Stolas was really listening.  \n  \nso yeah. Maybe someday these two will be in the right headspace to be a couple but honestly its good it didn't happen now. Neither is good for the other and had they actually made it serious then it probably would have been a trash fire.",
            "\"sorry hun, you can play as me but that don't mean you're anywhere close\" goes so fucking hard",
            "This one hurts. \n\nYou have Blitz, so damn guarded against making an actual relationship that he considers it transactional, but when confronted with the loss of it - in a moment realizes what it actually was. \n\nAnd then Stolas, that took an infatuation, and built it into a relationship in his own head, until it was reality, and not what the fantasy was. His mind was made up when he went to get the Oz crystals, the book was just his method of closure. \n\nBoth parties are emotionally stunted, and guarding against the other bc some parts are too good to be true - but neither can communicate when some parts aren\u2019t.",
            "I'm torn. I definitely feel like the Stolitz episode could have been separate from the cherubs. I understand why they were together, it was just frustrating to me.\n\nMy biggest pet peeve was Stolas tbh. I love him so so much, but he was a bit of a hypocrite in this episode. Instead of outright saying \"Blitz\u00f8, I want to be with you, I am in love with you. So I'm giving you an Asmodious Crystal in exchange for ending the contract so you don't feel obligated.\" Etc etc.\n\nInstead, it just felt like, to me at least, he was saying \"I'm ending our contract and arrangement, you're free to go, we're breaking up\"\n\nAnd when Blitz\u00f8 DID try to talk to him about it, Stolas teleported him away. \n\nI am so ungodly frustrated and sad. This episode was so incredibly well written but....I hate how the Stolitz ended...",
            "Stolas fucked up. Yeah, obviously Blitzo, but Stolas had terrible timing, made Blitzo think he was about to lose his livelihood,  didn't even wait for Blitzo to process that it's not about sex on the day they \\*have\\* sex, walked away all pseudo offended, and didn't give him a \\*second\\* for him to apologize. Man, come on. Really? I hope \\*he\\* apologizes too. I love him, but he gets \\*really\\* all up in his emotions and ideals. He had a clear plan, and a clear worst case scenario (one where Blitzo doesn't care and just leaves), so when Blitzo reacted differently than expected, the only thing he could do is walk away? That's not helpful! Yeah, even if he *wasn't* in love with you (which he is) he's very clearly showing that he doesn't just want you to just leave with no explanation or discussion? As the person who set this up, you have an obligation to explain it with him.  Rather than explain.  Blitzo's insults were *personal,* and not even all that true, and his screaming did NOT help, but I can't help but not blame him as much as I blame Stolas. It's a pretty 65/35 split of my \"blame\".\n\n\n\nOn a note unrelated to Stolitz, Loona just downed an entire hotel to save M&M?? Badass. Hope she goes back to being a main character soon, she's not had enough moments. Wish we could've seen more of Agent 1 and 2 shenanigans, but I really adore the Cherub's new outfits and their rapport.",

            "I can't believe you left us on a cliffhanger!!! I am so mad about that! But the episode was absolutely incredible and heartbreaking at the same time, looking forward to June",
            "IKR I WAS SO SURPRISED AND HAPPY TO SEE FIZZ IN THIS EPISODE",
            "I KNOW RIGHT THEY WERE SO FUN TOGETHER THEY MAKE SUCH CUTE FRIENDS. The fist bump from Fizz was great",
            "Happy to see he might not be a full-time clown anymore and is just working for Ozzie now",
            "I loved how nonchalant it all was. There was no big deal about going to see Fizz, no drama. He just called him up for a favor, and Fizz was happy to oblige. It was great. I hope to see more of them just being friends.",
            "Not just that, but Fizz was clearly happy that Blitz liked the toys. It was very cute.",
            "The proof that Blitz\u00f8 can fix things with his relationships... if he really want to.",

            "Such a one off line that I am really curious about the potential implications of.... Like, thats probably at least one episode worth of story next season right there.",
            "Also consider the impact on Ozzie's reputation, his relationship with Fizz, and Fizz and Blitz's friendship. Ozzie will look irresponsible for letting them have a crystal, Fizz will feel bad for recommending Blitz have one, and Fizz might be mad at Blitz for his company making such a mess in his boyfriend's ring. \n\nOn top of that, Ozzie said no to the crystal at first, and only changed his mind due to Fizz giving his blessing. That could cause  discord between them as well. And Fizz could get mad at Blitz for his company causing problems with his blessing. \n\nOur main duo are the co captains of the Hot Mess Express, and it looks like they've dragged two more people onto it. They unintentionally made such a big problem.",

            "to be fair people die a lot in hell, he may not have noticed",

            "\n\nI mentioned this somewhere else, too. I think the CHERUBS showing up is going to get both Blitz and Stolas in major trouble.\n\nTons of witnesses saw the CHERUBS dressed up like members of IMP while attacking IMP at the same time, then getting sent back to Earth through a portal. An investigation will most likely ensue to figure out how beings from Earth are accessing Hell, what they're motives are (answer: they were attacked by IMP in Season 1), and it won't take long for Hell's lawmakers to figure out that Blitz has been illegally accessing the human world, while using Stolas' grimoire, bringing Stolas into question.\n\nIt could throw an even deeper wedge between Blitz and Stolas, as they'll have to air out their lustful affair in front of every lawmaker in Hell.",
            "I was kinda expecting CHERUB to return in Masterminds. Maybe they will since there is apparently going to be another episode about DHORKS vs IMP. Also the portal probably just opens up to some random location in Hell, not just the Pride Ring.",
            "I didn\u2019t even know that was them the first time lol.\n\nAlso, regarding Collins question, it really goes to show that NO ONE, other than The Elders, knows what gets a human soul into Heaven.",

            "I was worried towards the middle section of the episode but I would say it all came together by the time Stolas & Blitz finally met up",
            "actually, the B plot would be the stolitz scene, because the CHERUBS comeback is the episode's description\n\nit's like the disney \"kids\" shows that have episodes each following a different plot, but is dropping a small, usually a minute clip of something big happening for the lore (i'm talking about you, The Owl House)",
            "I'm on the same boat. When I realized I was 17 minutes in without the meeting actually happening yet I was a bit offput, but tbh it *did* seem like it was just enough screentime in the end - At least enough for a cliffhanger. I still would have preferred more but they didn't skimp on the drama.\n\nStill though, I wish there was more of an emphasis on the \"Stolitz\u00f8\" side of things rather than whatever other plot is going on. I can see both sides, though, because if they *are* gonna have the DHORKS side plot it needs a bit more love before whatever climactic episode they end up having... I would simply personally prefer more fluff and romantic drama and such.",
            "Idk, this wasn't quite Western Energy levels of disconnected B Plot. \n\nThey rest of IMP was following their boss because they didn't want him to cock it up and they ended up protecting him from CHERUB... They all view Stolas as their meal ticket. And Blitz is responsible for them which applies more pressure on him building the tension. Not only is he scared of dying alone because he screwed up with Stolas, he thinks if he does the little family he does have will be ripped apart... \n\nIt all linked into Blitz's emotional state in a really nice way imho. Of all the approaches they could have taken I think the miscommunication trope worked well. And nothing either of them said to each other was out of character or out of left field. Honestly, the episode did a great job blending some of the zanier parts of HB with building up the massive emotional gut punch that was the last 2 minutes of the episode.",
            "I liked that they waited till the very end. Because I knew the breakup was coming, the entire episode made me sit in dread during the build up. Watching Blitz actually put effort into his meeting with Stolas (ANY effort, even if it was just for sex), was heartbreaking when I knew what was going to happen. Plus making the scene short was essential to actually understanding Blitz\u2019s viewpoint of the conversation, Stolas DID dismiss him and didn\u2019t give him time. If it were longer we as the audience might not have been able to sympathize with Blitz at all.",
            "I just don't understand how people are so adamantly on one side or the other, they are both hurt and they are both in the wrong. They both absolutely need to talk to each other, in a clear and concise way.",
            "Blitz's reaction is understandable, he tried to get Stolas to talk to him but Stolas kept pushing him away. I don't think any of us would be chill if someone we cared about suddenly decided to cut us out of their lives because we failed a secret test.",
            "If you want more stolas don't worry, next episode has some of my favorite stolas moments ;)",
            "Loona finally having abunch of lines (by her standards) and doing cool stuff was nice to see too!",
            "The callbacks to that episode were INSANE.  It wasn\u2019t just the chandelier:  the red book next to the asmodean crystal on Stolas\u2019s shelf is a pirate adventure book (titled \u201cThe Windowless World\u201d\u2026oof).  And Blitz chucking a bag full of goodies over Stolas\u2019s balcony, like the earlier episode but reversed , right down to collecting things for Stolas instead of taking things from him.",
            "Yea, it honestly made me a little mad how Stolas reacted to being called out after he acknowledged, both in private and to Blitz, that the terms of their relationship were unfair. It's like he wants to apologize but also doesn't want to face the consequences of his actions.",
            "It's almost funny in a way. Blitz has certain viewpoints because of his trauma, and not only has Stolas just proven to Blitz how ridiculous it is, but also that its a hurtful thing to think. Its not self destructive behaviour anymore he's hurting others",
            "Yelling at someone and insulting them is not \"willing to talk things out\"",
            "Dude really was ready to get in an actual fight with someone who could snap him in half, and thats sad :(",
            "His best bet would be Glitz and Glam.\n\n\nAnd I hope to see them again, and to see how Mammon handles someone who is not Fizz.",
            "Yeah, that was a HUGE kick to Blitz's self esteem there. Sex with Stolas was one of the few things he gave himself credit for. Stolas always enjoyed sex with him, yet ignored his sex toys and made him feel like it wasn't good enough. He broke Blitz's heart just as much as his own was broken.",
            "Also it's weird to hear When I See Him without all the screaming (not to bash the screaming, I'd scream too if I was there)",
            "Just noticed the book next to the grimoire is a thick book on pirate. Something to remind Stolas of Blitz?",
            "It was dropped at 1am for me so i was hella happy when i woke up and saw it in my subscriptions",
            "I mean I don't think Stolas ever really realized how messed up and self hating Blitz actually is, he took the confident brash rougeish facade he puts up at face value because that's always been how Blitz has presented himself to Stolas.",
            "YES.  Also\u2026\u201dThe Windowless World\u201d!? Excuse me,  Vivzie dropping hints like hammers if you can catch them..",
            "I liked Loona changing into her human form to make herself smaller.\n\n\nI was wondering if the disguises were illusions or if it actually changed their bodies. Nice to know it is the later.",
            "Stolas immediately going to the book was a massive screw up on his part and I think laid the groundwork for the rest of the scene. \n\nBy asking about the book and to take it back permanently *before* talking about his feelings or the Asmodian crystal put Blitz completely into \u201cI\u2019m going to lose everything\u201d panic. You can hear the utter *desperation* in his voice of like, \u201cdid I fuck it up? I fucked it up, nonononono let me fix it!\u201d\n\nThen the crystal comes out and Blitz has the whiplash. It\u2019s so much to process. He hasn\u2019t come down from the panic. He\u2019s not level headed. \n\nThen he gets told Stolas wants a relationship, not an arrangement. Yet another whiplash. He retreats into that it has to be the deal. It\u2019s comfortable, it\u2019s familiar. Stolas takes it as an *answer*. It escalates. \n\nStolas, intentionally or otherwise, completely overwhelmed Blitz emotionally. Blitz responded in anger, but I think that lines of \u201cyou spring this on me\u201d and \u201ccan I get a minute to think?\u201d say a lot. He felt blindsided (rightly or wrongly) and got handed a lot to process, while effectively being given no time to process.",
            "As he said before - \"he can get hurt?\". Stolas isn't just an untouchable demon - he's got feelings and can get hurt",
            ">  Stolas not realizing Blitz feels used and under Stolas's power. \n\nHe got the gem precisely because he realized it, but for some reason he thought that just fixing the power balance would instantly fix the trauma that imbalance had already caused. Blitz even called him out that he needed time and Stolas wasn't letting him have any.",
            "> I expected \\[it\\] to last longer and go deeper\n\nSo did Blitz lmao",
            "The cereal box says something about being for \u201cfunky shapes for sad demons \u201c too, lol.",
            "Yes!! Honestly I was gonna be annoyed if it was just basic miscommunication squeezed at the end BUT IT WAS PERFECT",
            "I assure you, you get your focus on Solitz content soon. The repercussions of that ending will be felt for a long while. \n\nNext episode is within a month and trust me, itll be a fan favorite. At least it's my favorite from the remainder of the season lol",
            "They make the episodes as long as they want to though, its not like some scene is taking away from another, they could have had 3 more minutes of Stolitz if they wanted to. Hyped for next month for more for sure.",
            "My only real criticism of this episode is that while their confrontation is well done, it feels really weird when you look back at how Stolitz acted embarassed to be seen with him and that aspect was never really brought up again.\n\nLike, yeah of course Blitz\u00f8 is gonna have issues sith you when you pull something like that and never really do anything about it.",
            "It seems they'll make up in Apology Tour (maybe not but the scene in the end with the warm looks gives me hope)",
            "As others have said, I reckon it was the moment it got through the trauma and he can't have any doubts anymore, like every reason he had to hold back has been crushed",
            "He's not dense. It's his defense mechanisms activating.",
            "Stolas, on the other hand, didn't give Blitz enough time to process what was going on. Like, I feel for Blitz because this literally came in all at once for him, and then to be dismissed of before he could apologize.",
            "Yup, he didn't want to be the one solely controlling the relationship...then did it by solely controlling the relationship. Catch 22",
            "I agree. Stolas admits the agreement is fucked up, transactional, is imbalanced, and he's in power.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nHe starts off with a transaction, doesn't give Blitz any time to process, and is upset when Blitz points out he's still controlling the relationship by walking away after emotionally dumping on Blitz.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nStolas dropped the ball here. He knew the situation was fucked and continued to do all the things that fucked it up.\u00a0",
            "honestly both of them are fuck ups. he was trying, just with the grace of a sledgehammer",
            "I think it's the depression. He covered up all of the portraits except for Via, a parallel to Blitz crossing his face from all his photos. He even covered the chandelier!",
            "It might have something to do with the divorce precedings? Stella could be asking for more furniture to spite him, and he doesn't have the energy or the will to oppose her.\n\n  \nHe could also be moving because that palace holds little but horrible memories.",
            "Maybe he's being forced to move",
            "I like the implication that the entire IMP gang can be stealthy enough to follow their boss around and keep an eye on him if they want to. Like, they've all got the skills to pull it off.",
            "And their half bullshit reason was that it was JUST about him not losing the book, when they were worried he'd get upset and do something stupid.",
            "Bro, what if it is Colin that alerts the Sins about the situation?",
            "Angels striking the Lust ring sounds like something that will provoke a response from Hell. Especially because nobody knows that the cherubs are banished from heaven.",
            "Seeing them battle the IMP crew was badass! Also, Collin going up against Loona and managing to overwhelm her briefly shows that he and the others are starting to improve from last time. Hopefully they start to develop into more serious threats.",
            "I really liked how they kept insisting on the demons being pure evil and out to harm humans, even as they were surrounded by demons peacefully living their lives, specially with that demon seller being nice to them.\n\nI mean, with IMP, you get where CHERUB is coming from and the way they scrutinize Blitzo's every move makes sense, but as it goes on, and put together with the way they excuse their activities on Earth, it really glues with the double standard we saw from the angels in HH.",
            "Bruh.\nStolitz is coming back soon",
            "I feel like the sex jokes are justified when every episode starts with the warning it does lol",

            "Oh they were definitely worried that something would happen and he'd do something stupid.",
            "It is also yet another example of Blitzo jumping into denial mode when he is presented with facts that he does not want to accept.",
            ">Nothing seemed \"extra special\" about the episode to me.\n\nThis was confusing to me as well. Given the length of the break I thought the episode would at least break the 30 minute mark.",
            "The episode was really good, but at the same time, I agree there wasn't any \"WOW!\" factor (imo). The one thing I noticed was that the quality of the visuals looked exceptionally good. The lighting specifically, was very high quality. The voice acting was amazing as well, but that is always expected with these talented people.",
            "I totally agree. The actual stolitz plot was only within the last 6 minutes, and it kind of ruined the ep for me. I wanted to like it a lot more than I actually did. The cherubs were good in isolation, but kinda time and place sort of thing imo",

            "Same. I was like okay great I don't massively care rn I need Stolas and Blitzzz",
            "It was really bad timing, though thats what makes it all the more real and believable. Sure the eskalation could have been avoided, but the reactions from both were completly understandable given the context and its not just a misunderstanding. This was just masterfully done and I hope we see them resolve this. Both of them deserve to be loved.",
            "My heart broke there. Blitz put in so much effort to receive nothing in return. Like the reverse of Ozzie's - the first time, Stolas put in all the effort and Blitz didn't appreciate it, now Blitz put in the effort and Stolas didn't appreciate it.",
            "To be fair, their actions are likely what leads to IMP's conviction and trial.",
            "All of this is exactly how I feel. I'm genuinely so disappointed, as the actual episode did not have enough on what it should have been focusing on. The cherub stuff was good, but shouldn't have been here. It should've been put into its own ep or a short or just, idk, anything. \n\nThe ending was gold. Chefs kiss. The visuals, the voice acting, the emotion, spectacular. But having a 23 min ep with only 5-6 of those min being what the episode was kind of advertised as is a huge miss that I can't get over",
            "> Over half of the episode was for a b plot that frankly, should have in another episode with the alouded time. Not the one dedicated to an emotional breakup in a long standing relationship that's issues were being set from the beginning.\n\nVirtually the entire episode was about that, in an indirect way. Everything with Blitz feeling \"in the mood\" to the revelation that they haven't been doing it for months now, to him 'preparing for their meeting' in what was obviously a slow-moving-train-wreck sort of way. \n\nThe CHERUB/DHORK plotline is important for two reasons, one it's the primary driver of action sequences in the series - something which I greatly appreciate, but which drama fans seem to be unable to stand. Two, it provides world building and more leadup of the consequences of IMP's actions. \n\nFor my money, it was a perfectly balanced episode. A good musical number, a good amount of comedy, a good amount of action, and all of that leading to a drama bomb at the end. They butter you up with a flashy fight sequence only to pay off the slow moving train wreck we all knew was coming at the end.\n\nThe show isn't pure drama, it will never BE pure drama, and it would be a factually worse end product if it were. Helluva/Hazbin has always been a mishmash of comedy, drama, and action and it's a better series because of it.",
            "Yea, this episode was a big miss for me.",
            "I wouldn't really complain about it. It may only be 6 minutes, but it didn't need to be any longer. There had to be some sort of b plot, otherwise the whole episode would've been like 10 minutes max.",
            "After Mammon's Magnificent Musical Mid-Season Special this one definitely felt off. Not much plot, not a lot of interactions between characters (minus the last 5 minutes), and not even that many laugh out loud jokes.",
            "That\u2019s exactly how I feel too. I don\u2019t really care about the CHERUBS or the DHORKS and the episode is literally named \u201cThe Full Moon\u201d why was the full moon part crammed into the end?",
            "Considering its apology tour he'll probably go over the top with it too haha",
            "The Story of Hell (from HH) does give Evil a face and talks about the \"angels shielding all from Evil\" and \"Evil making its way into Earth\", which could suggest Evil came from somewhere else.\n\nYou also have Stolas talking about Azathot.\n\nPaimon specifyng Stolas duty is to \"study the Earth's sky\", carries the implication of other skies out there being worthy of study to demons.",
            "Only a month of spiraling at most.",
            "I think we're supposed to take away that *both* of them don't know how to communicate healthily.\n\nI agree, Stolas just kind of sprung the Asmodean crystal and his feelings on Blitz and expected everything to go smoothly, and immediately closed off when Blitz took it the wrong way, *especially* by announcing it at a rendezvous Blitz had every reason to think was one of their regular transactional sex-sessions. Then Blitz immediately went for the throat by accusing Stolas of being unable to really care about a person like Blitz, which was a LOT more than Stolas could handle at the moment. Stolas was definitely worried about Blitz calling it off; he was absolutely NOT prepared for Blitz accusing him of being unable to really care about imps like him.",
            "Okay but to be fair if someone I loved reduced me down to \u201cjust a royal\u201d I\u2019d be upset too, especially since Blitz made it clear with his words in that scene his viewpoints on royals wasn\u2019t great. I\u2019d be upset in either of their positions. Neither of them meant to hurt each other, but both of them did. I saw somebody else say Stolas was prepared for rejection (a bit too prepared in my opinion) he was not prepared to be reduced to just his title.",
            "Methinks this has something to do with how Stolas was treated by Stella. She screamed at him and belittled him quite a bit, and so probably had a very strong reaction to the shouting in particular when it came from someone he does cherish. My feeling is, it hits different coming from Blitz, plus he had already felt let down with not being taken seriously earlier. I do think they\u2019re both wrong, but I think part of the reason Stolas went for one last little quip and then shutting him out completely is because he may not be tolerating that kind of behavior any more.",
            "Yes, I feel his actions contradict Just Look My Way a lot. He knows Blitz keeps walls up and that something unrelated to their relationship is going on, but it never occurs to him that this could be a factor in Blitz's reaction.",
            "That is most definitely a horse with a saddle on.",
            "I was wondering that too. Unless Exorcists are Heaven's guards/army because they really think Hell could attack them some day, and the population just don't know that they're killing souls there \"pre-emptively\".",
            "He also is a product of trauma, specifically from those more powerful than him, and has been abused his whole life from positions of power. Stolas rightfully wanted to correct the power imbalance but then thought once he \"righted the wrong\" Blitz would immediately drop the consequences of that imbalance that has been there for years.",
            "I mean it's certainly symbolism- notice Octavia is the only one uncovered, Stolas hates the other two components, Stella and himself.\u00a0 But it could mean more which is terrifying.",
            "I think the writers did pretty good at avoiding the worst miscommunication tropes. Sure Stolas and Blitz did miscommunicate, but it wasn't for lack of trying. Stolas corrected Blitz when he first misunderstood with the whole \"I want the book back permenently\" thing, and said his feelings really plainly before Blitz 'caught on' and thought it was role-play. After that it went downhill not because \"I'm not listening to what your saying\" trope, but because neither party knew how what they were saying and doing were more damaging and worse received than either thought it would be.",
            "I don't think it's so much that he's dense, he's just broken.  They both are and that's why they've never been able to communicate with each other.  Blitz doesn't feel that anyone can truly love him, especially not someone who is of \"higher station\", so he resorted to his self defense mechanism - humor.",
            "His self hatred was a bigger issue. He can't fathom the idea of Stolas genuinely liking him and seeing him as anything more than a plaything.",
            "I was like please let Blitz know this is gonna be a misunderstanding he's gonna be mad then HE TURNED AROUND VOICE CRACKING TEARS FLOWING like it got me so happy that it's not just a simple misunderstanding",
            "For me it was the whole ''treating us differently because we're SMALLER (the hand movement was perfect btw) and LESS IMPORTANT'' is what made me tear up, yes, I know, we already knew it was coming, but still, also the lip quiver was heartbreaking",
            "THIS. I love when movies and shows respect the intensity of a scene on its own merits to refrain from trying to artificially amplify it with a musical score. And the fact that they left the credits in silence. Perfect.",
            "YES! Speaking of hazbin hotel, I felt like some of the things the cherubs said when DHORKS caught them (\u201cexorcists killing demons\u201d, \u201cwhat are we talking about\u201d) were references to Hazbin\u2019s heaven characters, the former obviously the exterminators, and the latter being Lute\u2019s line in You Didn\u2019t Know)",

            "Millie got barred from the pain games after she got too many people killed, and Sally May felt the need to hide that one body... all this even though participation in the pain games means accepting a risk of serious injury or death.\n\n\nSo there are SOME standards at play, even if they don't align with human ones.",
            "Yup. Blitz was already on edge from Loona's comments earlier, this just made him immediately panic on the inside before Stolas could even get to his point.",
            "Yeah, love the guy but he really went about he whole situation poorly. Blitz was clearly excited for their night and had even prepared. Would've helped to do the deed first and once they're both satisfied and got some post-nut-clarity reveal the crystal and talk about their relationship's future.",
            "I kinda wanted to see blitzo's reaction to loona getting shot ngl\n\nmaybe next ep",
            "it\u2019s cause her boyfriend had recently died of colon cancer during voice recording sessions, FYI (no hate just explaining why she didn\u2019t talk)",
            "Same. Tho there is one scene from the trailer that shows the agents and Blitz with the crystal, so maybe another future episode will have them return?",

            "You're right, 14 vs 8 minutes as well; I guess that's just a little confusing given the name of the episode.",
            "ah the scooby doo mystery inc method",
            "It\u2019s always been the case that people will take one side. I don\u2019t know why they both can\u2019t be right and wrong.",
            "I agree. It\u2019s actually interesting/refreshing to see Stolas as more of an asshole than Blitz\u00f8, since often Blitz\u00f8 is placed in a position where he is the jerk instigating hate/distance against himself.\n\nAlso Stolas stated the conversation on the wrong foot, before he could even talk about his feelings he asked for the book back, essentially putting Blitz\u00f8 in a vulnerable position where he resorts himself to begging. Of course he was going to be defensive and angry.",
            "ooh well in that case im excited\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y52weja4ys3d1.jpeg?width=567&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae523c92a14a8204a6a4622aa83decf555f3fcf1",
            "I think he was so offput by Blitz focusing on sex and interpreting his roleplay as mocking that he wasn't listening clearly. He also has rock bottom self esteem, so he focused more on Blitz's insults than he did the entire message.",
            "In some fairness, I kind of get why Stolas reacts the way he does. He had just finished baring his soul to Blitz\u00f8 and was then effectively told that Blitz\u00f8 thinks he\u2019s a terrible person. That isn\u2019t an easy thing to hear, no matter how much he realizes their deal was wrong. Now, I don\u2019t really fault Blitz\u00f8 for lashing out either. He has a lot of trauma related to being abandoned and feeling like people can\u2019t really love him. He couldn\u2019t really process that Stolas was being genuine in the moment, and his own feelings on how Stolas treated him haven\u2019t really been addressed on his end, so he resorted to lashing out. I think Stolas took an important first step in actually acknowledging the problem verbally, but they\u2019re both still not all that great at communication.",
            "Stolad really doesn't realize the depths of the power imbalance and privilege he has. He was aware of it on a surface level, but he doesn't understand at all how his actions make Blitz feel. He's all \"i can't believe blitz thinks i'm that horrible!\" But, really, Blitz has every reason to think that, even without his self-loathing getting in the way. Stolas hasn't done anything to prove he's any different from other royalty. He still treats the rest of the lower class like shit, and he's treated Blitz like he's \"one of the good ones\" this whole time. Until Stolas can see impkind as a whole as actual people, their relationship isn't going anywhere.",
            "And then he boots him out with magic, further emphasizing that power imbalance and disregard for Blitz's ability to control... anything. The conversations starts and ends on Stolas' terms. Blitz arrives and leaves when Stolas decides he will.\n\nI know people love Stolas and I do too, but the guy has had no autonomy in his own life, and does the same thing to Blitz without regard. I don't think it's something he means to do, but it doesn't excuse that he has a lot of power and doesn't know how to have an equal relationship. They're pretty much equally messed up.",
            "I mean\u2026Stolas wasn\u2019t on his antidepressants (opening sequence his happy pills bottle is empty)and Blitz\u2019s words and anger are in line with his worst fears about how Blitz would respond.  Stolas is  hearing that not only was Blitz not interested, he was angry about the arrangement and the second he\u2019s free he\u2019s trying to get back at Stolas.",
            "Yes, he was somewhat aware that Stolas liked him, but he didn't realize how genuine those feelings were or how much those insults would insult Stolas. He didn't think Stolas would be that bothered by his opinion. \n\nThis is the first time he's seen someone not only genuinely like him, but also see the impact of how much he's hurt them. He minimized how much he hurt people until he saw Stolas crying.",
            "Exactly. Communication might be important, but comprehension matters just as much, if not more. If one person is not picking up on the words and emotions being conveyed to them, then communication doesn't mean squat.\u00a0 When Blitzo goes into defense mode, he has a tendency to deny reality and facts that are inconvenient to him.",
            "He was THAT desperate not to lose Stolas that he really did want to duke it out. But since he responded in a way that came off as mocking and wanted time to think about it, plus the insults, Stolas was done.",
            "I actually would love to see kore Glitz and Glam, I think they have a lot of potential.",
            "For real. Blitzo was so excited to show Stolas his haul for the evening, which he clearly put a lot of time and effort (and probably money) into. And Stolas just completely dismissed it. Of course Stolas was super anxious and understandably really focused on what he had to say, but man, if he'd only tried to see Blizto's perspective for a brief moment, they probably could have avoided hurting each other so badly. Makes for a really well written scene though.\n\nI just hope Blitzo isn't the only one who ends up apologizing for what happened here. He goofed up bad at the end, but Stolas set him up for hurt from the get go.",
            "The reason Blitz and Stolas keep talking past each-other is that both seem to be under the assumption that the other has their shit together.",
            "Yeah I liked that too. \n\nAnother note about Loona: I did not expect her, of all people, to be the one to tell Blitz that Stolas might be getting bored of him.",
            "YES. The biggest thing I noticed was how dismissive he was of Blitz's panic. That was just affirmation of Blitz's suspicions that he was bored of him. Then, he expects an answer on how Blitz feels right away.",
            "Yeah he knew Stolas wasn't invincible physically, but he didn't realize how emotionally sensitive he is.",
            "Yes! He never apologized for making Blitz feel used in the first place, came across as uncaring towards his efforts, didn't notice his panic, but expected Blitz to give him an answer regarding an actual relationship. Yes, he was right to be upset at Blitz joking around, but he was also sending mixed messages. \n\nIf he had started off acknowledging that their arrangement was unfair in the first place and apologized for his part of it, then at least he would sound more genuine BEFORE confessing his emotions.",
            "Is next episode when the divorce hearing happens? Or just more stolas content? I\u2019m starved \ud83d\ude2d",
            "If you mean how he covered his face at Ozzie's, in Western energy if you pause to see the text messages you can see how Stolas wanted to talk about it with Blitz\u00f8. The issue was that Blitz\u00f8 didn't want to make a big deal out of it and avoided having a real conversation, Stolas just accepted it and assumed it wasn't as important as he thought.\n\nThe key here is the miscommunication between the two, and how can they start to be assertive saying what they feel while taking into account the perspective of the other, instead of sweeping things under the rug.",
            "I'm hoping that they don't, since I think half the fandom has noticed the \"there's a big conflict and it gets resolved in that same or next episode\" pattern",
            "NO THEY NEED TO MAKE UP NOW",
            "Yeah, Blitz probably doesn't have anymore doubts about how Stolas feels. The covered chandelier when Stolas was hearing out blitz hurt. Here's hoping that Blitz goes to talk to fizz about this. I think he and Ozzie can help, a lot.",
            "Yep, Stolas had been thinking about this for months. Blitz found out just now.\n\n\nHowever, they're both dealing with depression and we're both on edge the entire episode.\u00a0",
            "Yeah, trying to correct solely controlling the relationship with 'you don't have to say anything, I already know enough' while walking away is probably not the best way to stop solely controlling the relationship.",

            "you\u2019re so right! it\u2019s heartbreaking both ways \ud83e\udd72 plus there\u2019s all the effort that Stolas went through to get Blitz his very own Asmodean crystal, legally in his name so he can permanently run IMP, which also went entirely unnoticed and unappreciated by Blitz",
            "I\u2019d have rather taken two shorter episodes each focused on the plots separately than one big episode where it all felt jumbled together tbh",
            "All the characters felt forced which doesn\u2019t seem like the right word considering they barely did anything, but I think that\u2019s the best way to describe it. No one really talked except for just a one liner each in the fight. Even then it didn\u2019t feel like moxxie at all when he said \u201cwelcome to hell bitch\u201d or smth like that",
            "Stolas trying to get Blitz to spend time with him otherwise has always gone sour though.\u00a0",
            "Yea, I didn't expect perfection from Stolas, I just think he was more in the wrong than Blitz. I would be more understanding of Stolas if Blitz had gone straight to classism and how he thought Stolas looked down on him, but I don't think him trying to defuse the situation was worthy of Stolas shutting him out.",
            "Yeah, we\u2019re really just seeing Blitz\u2019s trauma shine through here. He\u2019s been horribly abused and abandoned by almost every authority figure in his childhood. It doesn\u2019t register for him that Stolas is being sincere here. He thinks it must be some sort of joke or roleplay scenario.",
            "He also seems like the one who always pushes others away.  Being the one who gets pushed back is not something he can handle at the moment.",
            "Yeah, you're right on that. I understand that blitz thinks no one could love him, that's partially why I said he was dense. Though, stolas was laying clues about this, not wanting to do the arrangement and stuff.",
            "In all honesty? I don't blame Blitzo. Sure, bro lost his temper and didn't realize Stolas was being sincere, but given how Stolas has been accidentally treating him and other Imps throughout the series (Accidentally convincing his dad to rent Blitzo like a cheap Disney Sequel from Blockbuster, manipulating him into a coercive deal he couldn't reasonably say \"No\" to lest he lose his livelihood, ignoring boundaries set up by Blitzo, accidentally making stressors worse by saying the wrong things at the wrong time, using his butler as a stress ball when upset, etc and so forth) even if he never meant it to be malicious or intentional, he did definitely cause a lot of trouble for Blitzo by just being ignorant. Props to him for trying to make things right, but sometimes it's too little too late tbh.",
            "Exactly.\n\nBlitzo's brain will not allow him to comprehend even to potential reality that Stolas wants something from him that isn't just sex. Just the exact same way that he refused to believe that Stolas could be hurt until M&M told him he was badly injured.\n\nIt has become consistently\u00a0apparent in this season that Blitz struggles to accept facts, even when laid bare in front of his face, due to his trauma.",
            "Yeah, his self hatred is huge, probably why he seemed so dense about Stolas' feelings.",
            "SAME. I was so relieved to hear Stolas explicitly say how he felt and what he wanted. the misunderstanding trope would've been so frustrating, given how much buildup this moment has had.",
            "yes! the whole scene was beautifully done & heart breaking.",
            "Wait, so does that mean that Cletus and Keenie are aware of the exterminations while Colin is not or were they just pulling that out of their ass to save face?",
            "It actually raises some questions. Noone but the exorcists is to know about the exterminations.  \nDid everyone know about exorcists but not exterminations, and thats how cherubs knew that word? What do the exorcists do according to the rest of Heaven's understanding, that requires them to wear these scary masks?  \nDoes Helluva happen before Hazbin, where Heaven doesnt know about both the exorcists and exterminations? How did the cherubs know then?  \nDoes it happen after the trial in Hazbin, so cherubs learned about exorcists that way? Then the image of an exorcist on a newspaper Blitz is holding in s1ep7 should indicate that exorcists are still a regular occurence in the news despite Heaven knowing, right? Or did the Hazbin trial happen between s1ep7 of Helluva and s2ep8 of Helluva?",

            "Actually thinking further on this, I think you are maybe right, and it also ties back into Mammon's ep. Mammon wants vengeance on Asmodeus for Fizz's show, and now Asmodeus is the unknowing employer of abunch of Imps that go to earth and murder people violating all sorts of rules I'm sure. I don't think Stolas explicitly told Asmo what Blitz and Co do.... so now you've got an easy way to attack Asmo, through Blitz's company, and Stolas would be a key witness in any sort of... hellish prosecution?\n\nCould be totally off, but I could see it being plausible, then end it with Stolas being found guilty of assisting them, IMP breaking him out and going on the run, as the humans attack hell through their portal. Season 3 boom.\n\nEdit: Though the guys in hoods in the trailer are some sort of hellspawn, since they've got red skin so who knows.",
            "And the cold way he didn't acknowledge any of Blitz's efforts with his outfit, the sex items, or his panicking. He just listened to Blitz's sarcasm/insults while ignoring his bigger message. \n\nBlitz DID tell Stolas that he felt used by Stolas's power (yet again), that he didn't appreciate so much being sprung on him and wanted time to process it, and he wanted to talk to Stolas and work things out. Stolas didn't listen to the entire message, just the insults, and refused to let Blitz apologize. \n\nWhile I feel sorry for Stolas, I think he was the bigger problem here. I wonder if running out of his happy pills was a part of it?",
            "Oh I wouldn't have done the deed first! That would come across as one last mercy fuck. But he should have acknowledged all the effort Blitz put in.",
            "Stolas probably single-handledly paved the entirety of Hell given how many of his good intentions backfire horribly on him and others....",

            "One of the things I appreciate a great deal about both Hazbin and Helluva is that they're kind of a smorgasbord of things I like. Drama, world building, character design, AND action. \n\nSpectacle fight scenes are like fireworks, they're pretty enough on their own to justify their existence, even without too much further substance. I appreciate their inclusion always. \n\nThis episode was, for my money, a perfect balance of everything. A great musical number at the start (complete with many brilliant cut gags), world building and character design (everything to do with DHORK and Cherubs; and the candle and sex toy shop owners) a good action sequence (Seriously, the fight between the cherubs and IMP was quite well done) and then after using the fireworks display to lighten the mood, absolutely WHAM us with an emotional nuke with very effective use of sound (Blitz trying kinky things to dead silence was so tense)\n\nI don't mind episodes that are more lopsided towards drama or comedy or even action, but this felt like the right blend of all elements to make me a very, very happy camper.\n\nI feel like there's a number of people who only really appreciate the drama and get grumpy when the series isn't *just* a drama. Like - those other bits are great in their own right. And Hazbin/Helluva wouldn't be what they are if they stuck to strict drama all the time (or even dramedy)",

            "Yea, I really wish Stolas had paused to reassure Blitz when Blitz first started freaking out and begging Stolas to have sex with him, instead of just assuming the worst. He looks so terrified during their conversation. It probably wouldn't have stopped Blitz from going into denial mode but it would've made me more sympathetic to Stolas.",
            "Yeah Stolas didn\u2019t realize it, but he had all the power in that conversation.",
            "Yea... such a sad episode, but we all knew it had to get sadder before they could start healing ;_;",

            "My way of thinking about it is that Stolas covered the correct points in the wrong order. He went:\n\n1. Taking back the book\n\n2. Giving the crystal\n\n3. Addressing the power imbalance\n\n4. Talking about his feelings.\n\nHe should have made taking back the book the \\*last\\* thing, after the crystal. It should have been:\n\n1. Addressing the power imbalance.\n\n2. Discuss his feelings\n\n3. Giving the crystal\n\n4. Taking back the book. \n\n  \nHe recognized how unhealthy the power imbalance was, but failed to recognize that taking back the book before giving the crystal would've put Blitz into \"My entire life is under existential threat\". He knew the power imbalance was unhealthy, but he failed to grasp \\*just how big the imbalance was\\*. Stolas had total control of Blitz's business. He could've shut down IMP on a whim at any moment. \\*He put Blitz into a position where Blitz thought he was actively losing everything he had worked for, then Stolas told him he had feelings for him\\*. It was supremely unfair.",
            "Even worse. He interpreted it as mere negativity towards him.    \nStolas can be quite self-centered at times.",
            "Every second I spend thinking about this interaction brings me closer to setting up a 'BLITZ DID NOTHING WRONG' booth. The conversation starts off on such a bad foot, I can't think of anything Blitz could've realistically done to salvage it.\n\nBut I can think of one thing Stolas could've done, which is stop for a second and let Blitz know he's not in trouble. Blitz still could've doubled down, he's got that self-hatred, but I feel like Stolas just taking a moment to say \"Calm down, I'm not mad at you\" would've made Blitz's reaction a *choice.*",

            "Yup. But it's also important to remember it's a reason not an excuse. Already seeing Blitz defenders, but Stolas did everything right. Blitz owes Stolas an apology - but I suspect we're getting that in Apology Tour\n\nEDIT: To clarify, I mean within his limits. He could've gone about it better but he did lay out his feelings as clear as possible, give Blitz the crystal, waited for Blitz to respond and if Blitz wanted to ask for more time - he honestly did a very good job considering his upbringing",
            "Yup. A lot of people have missed the text messages which is understandable, but they clearly show Stolas hasn't been all about sex for a while",
            "The rest of the stuff Stolas did I agree with you about but if a sad ten year old can't enjoy a clown on his birthday without being accused of 'accidentally convincing his dad to rent Blitzo like a cheap Disney Sequel from Blockbuster,' then I don't know what to think.  That's entirely on Paimon and Cash and shouldn't be included in a list of Stolas' mistakes.",

            "I don't think \"killing humans\" is illegal, because the characters always talk about it pretty openly and without worry. IMP has Billboards in Pride, and Millie's family knows and doesn't express any worry over it.\n\nStolas himself only ever notes the travel method to be \"illegal\". In fact, one of the notable changes between the Pilot and the Series is that in the Pilot, IMP shows off the grimoire in their publicity, while they never do that in the series.\n\nThe other thing that they are likely to get in legal trouble for is the lack of disguises, since that is sth that both Loona and Verosika called IMP out for.",

I wouldn't expect Stolas to be perfect either, but god, he really did a bad job. Worse than Ozzie's.",
            "For Stolas, this was really the final straw. He was frustrated prior to Ozzie's due to Blitz not showing him any romance, Ozzie's was a confusing disaster, the perceived disinterest in his text messages, and the hospital incident. Combine that with his giving Blitz the choice to skip their meetings (which he did), Octavia splitting her time with Stella, and running out of medication? The only crutches he's willing to use for his depression/loneliness were no longer available, and he let his inner demons take over. \n\nThis makes me wonder if he really will roast Blitz in the next episode. Medicated, less depressed Stolas wouldn't do that. But this Stolas? He isn't himself.",

Not a very effective one in explaining all that we want to know, but effective enough to feed us enough crumbs to keep us discussing and speculating while the story unfolds.  \nWe now know that humans can build a gate to hell. They made it clear that the missions of IMP were indeed not unnoticed and even filmed stuff. The films survived the weird outage at the end of episode 6. The cherubs are wielding angelic steel, so we see more about the use of that stuff. Judging at the reaction of Millie, even imps might find angelic steel even more painful than multiple bear traps.  \nThose comic relief idiots are littering info left and right.",
            "I think this is going to get both Blitz and Stolas in trouble.\n\nTons of witnesses saw the CHERUBS dressed up like members of IMP while attacking IMP at the same time, then getting sent back to Earth through a portal. An investigation will most likely ensue to figure out how beings from Earth are accessing Hell, what they're motives are (answer: they were attacked by IMP), and it won't take long for Hell's lawmakers to figure out that Blitz has been illegally accessing the human world, while using Stolas' grimoire, bringing Stolas into question.\n\nIt could throw an even deeper wedge between Blitz and Stolas, as they'll have to air out their lustful affair in front of every lawmaker in Hell.",
            "and they hyped up this conversation so much in the trailer. don't get me wrong, I liked the episode, but it's a little frustrating.",
            "That\u2019s fair. I think they both kind of fumbled the situation, honestly. I think that\u2019s to be expected because they\u2019re both really bad at communicating. I think Stolas did to the right thing in explicitly telling Blitz\u00f8 he cares about him in a way beyond transactional sex and cutting off their deal, but I think he had the hope of things working out too much in his head. He doesn\u2019t really notice how tense Blitz\u00f8 is throughout the whole conversation, and then he reacts poorly when he resorts to joking. On Blitz\u00f8\u2019s end I think he doesn\u2019t really know how to process someone being genuine with him. The proper response probably would have been telling Stolas he needed time to process everything. I think Stolas would have accepted that answer. However, resorting to joking as his self-defense mechanism just pushed Stolas away, and verbally lashing out due to his trauma also didn\u2019t help things.",
            "This exactly. He did what needed to be done, but came across as selfish, uncaring, and using his power over Blitz. Then thought Blitz would be interested in a relationship. And Blitz has been hurt by Stolas from the beginning, yet he didn't acknowledge where he, specifically, has gone wrong.",
            "I also think he only kind of addressed the power imbalance. He thinks that replacing the book with the crystal fixes a problem that\u2019s still built into their social hierarchy. \n\nIf nothing else, I\u2019d guess Blitz still thinks Stolas is embarrassed to be seen in public with him after Ozzie\u2019s. His comment to Fizz and Ozzie about being hypocrites for being in love calls back to that night.\n\nMeanwhile Stolas thinks his emotions about how highly he thinks of Blitz trump the reality of their social imbalance and then throws Blitz out for calling him because that dynamic is still affecting him.\n\nNone of which addresses the part where Stolas also had months to think this through while he left Blitz in the dark. He then didn\u2019t give Blitz any grace or time to process some major dynamic-changing revelations that require Blitz to like himself even a little to take seriously.",
            "He also never reassured Blitz when he was panicking about his bedroom skills. And after he confesses to Blitz, he teleports him out of his palace. That and is sending a very mixed message - that while Stolas may love him, he'll throw Blitz away as soon as he's angry. That isn't going to entice Blitz to want a relationship.",
            "They still both suck badly.    \nBlitz sucks in the sense of being panicky-blunt in a quite consistent way.    \nStolas is a rollercoaster of being reasonable and then way dismissive in the blink of an eye (or four).    \nBlitz might be a slightly better listener, but his skills are still low level.    \nStolas has a problem of listening when he is in speaking modus. At those moments he purely lives in his head which is filled with personal problems, romantic novels and hella-novellas.  He really needs to get outside more in a world where he is not made to be the center of his tiny world.",
            "totally, thanks!! this episode was so incredible \ud83d\udc4f",
            "woah how\u2019d I miss that?!? Now i\u2019ve gotta go watch it again frame for frame. thanks, I have hope \ud83e\udd72",
            "Yeah I've said since the start this 100% a two part kinda deal. I was prepared we'd have a cliffhanger, because releasing these two right next to each other shows that they're likely together",
            "Yeah, though it would make sense that after the communication, they give each other some space. For how many episodes, I don't know.",
            "tbh I also like Keenie as a character... it's really just Cletus who annoys the shit out of me, and I wouldn't be the slightest bit upset if he died, or one of the other two assumed leadership of their trio",
            "Ehh, I don\u2019t agree. Stolas kept speaking and deciding on blitz\u00f8\u2019s behalf.\n\nHe never actually gave blitz\u00f8 a chance to process things, immediately wanted an answer and when blitz\u00f8 tried to explain he misunderstood the situation he kicked him out.\n\nCommunication goes both ways here and being able to listen to someone is more than half of what communication is, in this case Stolas literally decided for Blitz\u00f8 that Blitz\u00f8 never loved him.\n\nThe way they BOTH handle communication is the issue.",
            "I disagree, I love Stolas with all my heart but he definitely didn't do everything right and is far from innocent. He ignored his status and how that played into their relationship, sure for the most part he treated blitz as an equal, until they went in public. Stolas hiding his face on thee date after being called out, that really hurt blitz and it reinforced his belief that Stolas thinks he's better than him. Stolas never tried to actually talk to blitz, tell him his feelings, and in this episode we see him demand an answer from Blitz without truly clearly articulating his feelings. You can't spring that on someone and expect an immediate response, everyone needs time to process. They need to apologize to *each other*. \n\nNeither is Blitz innocent, and he also let his trauma prevent him from being honest. It's old, but this video does a great job highlighting Stolas 's status; how it relates to their relationship and why it's just a shit situation for both of them. It even dives deep into their text messages and pictures. \n\n https://youtu.be/8tVqwswbqm4?si=cnLvgb0L4NvdEk0W",
            "Healthy communication means listening to your partner\n\nStolas tried, but he let his hurt feelings as an excuse to assume Blitz\u2019s answers and walk away\n\nHim walking away and speaking over Blitz just passed him off more cuz it made him feel powerless and small\n\nBlitz wasn\u2019t perfect and obviously screwed up, but it\u2019s crazy how many people are saying Stolas did everything perfectly when he obviously didnt",
            "> stolas did everything right\n\nLol. Thats not true. It may make sense for you as an outside observer that he was logical but he is talking to someone he knows yet he talks to a butler. He absolutely deserved what he got from Blitz who is also at fault but claiming the OWL is 100% right is just fangirling, no offense.",
            "I completely see what you\u2019re saying, and you\u2019re right, but having read an email from my toxic ex (who I realize was only half of the problem) tonight, I also see that Stolas didn\u2019t take the extra step to meet Blitz on his level. He shouldn\u2019t have to, and wouldn\u2019t if Blitz had ever gone to therapy ever, but it kinda shows that Stolas was only really considering his own wants and feelings without truly empathizing with where Blitz is at, as evidenced by Blitz blatantly admitting that he sees himself lower than him and Stolas focusing only on his image in Blitz\u2019s eyes. \n\nHonestly after watching Abbott Elementary last night and cringing at the simplicity of it all, this was a welcome change. Blitz needs time to realize Stolas was serious, and Stolas needs time to get out of his own head. It was frustratingly futile for now but it\u2019s the first conversation that\u2019s given me actual hope for the two.",
            "Stolas did everything he reasonably could to both admit he was taking advantage of their power imbalance, try correcting that, and... Blitz just.... \n\nI'm gonna just say it. He fucked up. he fucked up hard, and i don't know /HOW IN THE HELL/ he would be able to unfuck what happened.",
            "Yeah. Even look my way was a pretty big clue that Stolas was done with the transactional sex and wanted something real with Blitz.",
            "Yeah, fair point now that you bring it up. Never really pictured it quite as \"renting a clown for party services\" tbh.",
            "Yeah at first watching through Full Moon I was like, \"okay what has been making this episode so special?\" Then got to the end & then, damn, okay I see why now lol. I feel like it's tied with S2E6 & S2E7 in terms of how good it is",
            "Any type of hard date?",
            "Could be yea, or maybe lending the book itself is the illegal act?, since we know that normally so far only Asmo's servants are mainly traveling up to Earth. \n\nEdit: If lending the book was the illegal act, it would explain how we end up with Stolas on trial, but not sure if it would come back to Mammon acting against Asmodeus through their new contract at that point. Guess I'll wait n see.",
            "To be fair blitzo only moved to insults after stolas stopped listening to him",
            "What was he supposed to do though. I think he was pretty thoughtful",
            "Part of what made me feel the most for Stolas in this scene was actually the way he handled this situation. When you feel like someone is using you for something, part of you can feel like getting back at them, making them feel the pain that you have felt, sometimes in an attempt to merely be understood. I know my imagination has gone there sometimes. \n\nYes, he could have handled the situation better and it would have ended differently, but I think it shows us all the pain that Stolas has gone through in their relationship. We already know all the feelings he's gone through, but does Blitz know? I think Stolas senses that he doesn't, but he wants him to so badly that he's willing to cause him pain just to show him. It's not right, and it will only cause more problems further down the line, but I understand why he did it.",
            "Want more about them, Idc, now I want an Helluva short just about them",
            "\"You've weakened yourself, and now for my true strike!\" straight to everyone's unguarded hearts lol",
            "The problem is starting off with the book first and coming across as so uncaring to all of Blitz's efforts AND panic. Had Stolas started off by explaining their transactional arrangement is a problem and apologizing for his end, at least he'd come across as more genuine when he confessed later. Blitz's self hatred would have won anyway, but he also dealt a massive blow to Blitz here.",
            "Man this whole thread sums up all my issues with Stolas here. He continues to forget his relationship isn't just them and that all his repsect and affection for Blitz means diddly if it folds when things get hot, like you mentioned.\n\n\nLike Stolas doesn't get the fact that honestly, it would be insane for Blitz to consciously let himself get emotionally invested here. Stolas is financially, politically , societally, and physically more powerful than Blitz. Any boundaries Blitz has is because Stolas allows them, he has nothing to that he can truly protect except for his heart here. And on top of that any negative fall out or pettiness in case the relationship goes sour falls on Blitz.",
            "Yea, I got the impression that Stolas had this whole thing rehearsed in his head and was paying more attention to his own performance than Blitz's reaction to it.",
            "Stolas was a bunch of tiny needle prick problems.\n\nBlitz was a big blow up problem.\n\nProblem is, because of the power/size difference, a needle to Stolas would be a spear to Blitz.",
            "It's in the end when Blitzo is looking up with a blanket on him and then we see Stolas turning to the camera all happy and stuff",
            "Yea, I think Blitz is going to be visiting his Ex's and realizing just what a fuckup he did, and Apology Tour is gonna start up almost exactly where this one left off. You're right, releasing them so close together feels like it spawned off of that.",
            "THANK YOU. This is literally the first time I see someone pointing this out. Pretty much everyone's jumping the \"haha Blitz fucked up again, surprise surprise\" wagon while ignoring it was still all about Stolas.\n\nAnd Blitz COULDN'T even make his point because the powerful royal demon decided nah, enough.\n\n(None of them is a bad guy. They're both overwhelmed and hurt.)",
            "Yeah, Stolas kind of went into the whole interaction on preemptive defense, ready for the rejection and accepted the first negative reaction as a confirmation. This is something I\u2019ve done many times in my life. \n\nBoth of them messed up here for entirely understandable and empathetic reasons. Both deserve an apology from the other for different reasons, in my opinion.",
            "We already saw in Loo Loo Land (she said she didn't want to go SEVERAL times) and even in Murder Family (gun shots and screams are certainly not a sign that the situation is fit for negotiating fukkyfukky time) how incredibly bad Stolas' listening skills are. It's like he's rolling perception checks with double disadvantage.\n\nBut yeah, he started out so well.  \nAnd then it went as empty as his bottle of happy pills.",
            "But he didn't immediately want answer. He would've completely accepted if Blitz said he needed more time I'm sure.\n\nStolas quite literally said that he felt uncomfortable with it all being about sex anymore, he expanded on that, explained it, laid his heart bare - then Blitz said 'anyway sex?'. His words had been completely disregarded, I don't blame him for misunderstanding and leaving. He communicated as best he could and I honestly think he did as much as he humanly could.",
            "Stolas also needs his privilege checked. People often forget that",
            "I'm not sure if this was intended, but I see Stella in Stolas' behavior. \n\nThink about the order of operations here. First, Stolas calls Blitz over under false pretenses (to have sex). Then Stolas meets him in a dark room, allows Blitz to make a fool of himself, then terrifies him by asking for the Grimorie. He lets Blitz be afraid for a long time before he explains what he wants. Finally, he cuts Blitz off before he can fully process what's happening.\n\nTo me all of this sounds like stuff Stella would pull on Stolas early in their relationship, when Stolas was still trying to make it work. People who are traumatized sometimes accidentally hurt others in the same ways they've been hurt.\n\nI'm still in Blitz's corner tho. Tbh, while his reaction wasn't the best, I don't think he said or did anything to warrant Stolas pushing him away like that.",
            "I feel like people forget\u2026.Stolas has been trying to talk things through SINCE Ozzie\u2019s. Blitz\u00f8 has been avoiding it for his own obvious reasons. Heck he says it in the song in this episode. Stolas extended the branch and Blitz\u00f8 ignored it. With Stolas seeing how this power dynamic is taking advantage of him and Blitz not trying. I understand why Stolas did what he did. Blitz said hurtful things and he removed himself from the hurtful comments.",
            "And to add to this, I think Blitz is the only one who truly takes into consideration their difference in station. The grimoire was just a tangible representation of the imbalanced power dynamic the two of them have. It exists with or without the grimoire. Even the gemstone was only possible because Stolas did something basically unheard of and interceded on the behalf of an imp. What guarantee does Blitz have that if this relationship doesn't work out that the gem can be revoked? Stolas is sweet but he's still someone who could ruin everything Blitz has scrabbled to build for himself with very little effort",
            "The issue is that Blitz, due to his past traumas, thinks that people of a higher status are just trying to manipulate him. In \"Oops\", he lists a myriad of romantic, non-sexual overtures that Stolas makes as supposed evidence that Stolas is manipulating him. Fizz sees through it that Stolas is being honest, but the conversation gets derailed after that. Blitz needs to get over that past trauma and realize Stolas is different, but he couldn't make that leap in time before Stolas showed him the door.",
            "Yeah, and he literally said to Blitz I'm not comfortable with this anymore and it's wrong, and Blitz basically responded with haha anyway sex? Like no wonder Stolas stormed off",
            "Nah, I agree with you it's was a fucked up thing cause Blitz\u00f8 was exploited but I place the blame entirely on Cash and Paimon, even though you've now made me consider Paimon's half maybe like hiring a clown (he uses the phrase, 'buy the little clown boy,' which makes me feel gross inside) for a day.  Cash has no excuse, though.  He treated his son like a commodity and manipulated him when he expressed fear.",
            "Also, it probably would have been a bad idea for Stolas to give any indication to Blitzo that he wanted anything that night other than to clear the air and have a conversation. People need to keep in mind that we are talking about a guy who will so quickly go into defense mode in order to protect himself from being vulnerable, even if it has to go to the level of denying reality. The simple fact of the matter is, I think it's pretty clear that Blitzo is not ready for any kind of healthy relationship at the moment.",
            "I would love that. Just the day in the life of two hellborns.",
            "I think it\u2019s important to keep in mind that Stolas isn\u2019t exactly a great communicator himself. I agree that opening with the book wasn\u2019t great, and he was kind of oblivious to Blitz\u00f8\u2019s fears and tensions throughout. I think on Stolas\u2019s end he was so focused on actually ending the arrangement that he didn\u2019t notice some of Blitz\u00f8\u2019s emotional cues.",
            "The way Stolas starts this conversation is so *menacing* and I'm shocked more people haven't picked up on that. Watching it made me feel like I'd been called to the principal's office with no idea of what I'd done wrong, which did actually happen to me when I was younger, and it's so terrible to be forced into a position to feel like your future is on the line but you don't know why. \n\nI've seen people claim Blitz was in the wrong for talking so much about sex, but he's not doing it because he's horny this time. He's terrified. He's on his knees begging Stolas to fuck him because he's afraid of losing his business. God it actually makes my stomach twist to think about what must've been going through Blitz's head at that moment.",
            "I understand Blitz's reaction. I also understand Stolas' reaction.\n\nStolas has put up with a lifetime of being degraded and screamed at because of Stella.\n\nStanding up for himself with the divorce, Stolas has grown, because he isn't going to put up with that toxic belittling, while Blitz is still--Blitz, who throughout the whole show, has struggled to believe anyone could actually love him, because he doesn't even love himself.\n\nStolas is carrying on, learning from his mistakes while trying to make things right, but after Blitz's angry outburst, Blitz has incorrectly shown Stolas that Stolas' feelings are invalid, something Paimon drilled into Stolas since a child. Blitz calling Stolas just a rich asshole is also a crushing moment. Stolas was forced into this life of royalty, but hoped he was connecting with an old friend who could look past all that. If Blitz is going to make this work, Blitz needs to learn to love himself the same way Stolas is learning to stand up for himself. Blitz will also need to own up to the fact that he stole from Stolas as a kid and then tried to get away with stealing Stolas' grimoire as an adult. \n\nEdit: While Stolas is also continuing to learn, he will eventually need to continue confronting such aggressively belittling behaviors from others rather than running from them. Although both of them are in the wrong, I do believe Stolas is a step ahead of Blitz in his personal healing journey.",
            "Literally teleporting him out as soon as he was really hurt proved Blitz\u2019s point a bit. Sure Stolas might love him, but he threw him away basically even if it\u2019s somewhat deserved instead of both talking it out fully",
            "They are both traumatized people, and neither one was giving the other the time to process their emotions. I hate this (I love it).",
            ">perception checks\n\nStolas: \ud83c\udfb5 *You're a short motherf\\*cker and nobody likes you!* \ud83c\udfb5",
            "He really did. He even handled the first few Blitz moments incredibly well. But while his threshold is higher at this point it\u2019s still way too low to handle Blitz\u2019s self-loathing.",
            "Exactly. \n\nThis episode just proved what I have been repeating for months at this point. We all know that Blitzo has problems. But something that is seldom spoken of is the sheer level that he will delude himself when he wants to deny the reality of something that hits close to home.\n\nStolas realized \"favors for favors\" was not working out **occurred**ago by the time this episode occurred. And even though there have been communication issues with them, Stolas was as open and vulnerable as possible.\n\nBoth of these characters are traveling their own path, but the difference is, Stolas fully understands that their prior arrangement is unhealthy and took steps to change it, while Blitzo's brain simply won't *let* him believe Stolas can be motivated by anything other than physical desires, just the same way he was initially in disbelief that Stolas can be hurt.",
            "But Stolas never told Blitz not to expect sex that night. He provided no explanation, at first, for why he didn't want it, showed no appreciation for the effort Blitz put in, and when Blitz started questioning if his sexual skills were good enough, Stolas offered him no reassurance. \n\nStolas only did his explanations AFTER taking the Grimoire, which made Blitz think his entire life was in upheaval. That makes anything Stolas said after the fact highly questionable, like he was playing a game. And Stolas has never apologized for the original source of tension between them: treating Blitz like a sex toy. \n\nYou don't load a bunch of sensitive information onto someone without warning, in a very short period of time, after you put them into panic mode, then expect them to respond well. It doesn't work that way. \n\nNow that mean Blitz was justified in insulting Stolas? Absolutely not. But Stolas did come across as pompous in the end. Blitz also clearly stated that he wanted time to think, but Stolas had already shut him down.\n\nBlitz's final message was very clear: that he doesn't appreciate Stolas wielding power over him without warning. And that's exactly what he did, despite it being the same problem from the beginning. And by kicking him out of the mansion and ignoring his pleas to resolve things, Stolas just reinforced Blitz's paranoia: that the second he's sick of Blitz, he's tossing him aside.",
            "I cannot believe people always forget this. Stolas is demon royalty, Blitz is a member of the lowest class of demons in hell. That dynamic has ALWAYS been present with them and Stolas needs to realize that!",
            "Glad someone else explained it. Blitz did not intentionally hurt Stolas at first - Stolas scared the shit out of him, showed no caring for his emotions, presented everything in the wrong order, then left before he fully processed what Stolas said. While Blitz shouldn't have done the roleplay bit, he didn't listen when Blitz tried to explain he didn't think it was serious and he wanted time to process what happened. Sure, his insults gave Stolas every right to be hurt - but when Blitz didn't reciprocate his feelings in 5 seconds, Stolas ignored the overall message he was trying to convey - that he was taken off guard, wanted time to think, and didn't want to leave until it was all sorted out. \n\nI hope they BOTH end up apologizing. Stolas is also responsible for this. And Blitz's sarcastic, crass nature isn't going to disappear overnight. If Stolas wants him, he has to learn when not to take Blitz's rage that seriously. I know Blitz needs to work on his temper, but you can tell when he means it and when he doesn't. \n\nTeleporting him out was a low blow and just reinforced Blitz's suspicions that Stolas really will throw him away when he's done.",
            "Yeah... And then just added on to it by convincing Blitzo to rob the place dry, too when he simply could have asked for a higher payment.\n\nCash is the worst....",
            "He could have told Blitz that he wanted to do something other than sex. He can't be surprised that Blitz wanted it so badly when they hadn't had it for months and there was no warning that things would be different. Blitz was ok with Stolas wanting different things in their text messages, but Stolas gave him the option to not come over. \n\nStolas is no more ready for a romantic relationship than Blitz is. He mistakenly believes that that is the key to his happiness. While it certainly helps, you can't rely on one person alone to make you happy. He needs social interaction and better communication skills outside of romance.",
            "I want something like a date\n\n\nNow that I think about it, I've never even seen them talk to each other",
            "I don\u2019t think it helps that Loona had put it in his head that Stolas was probably bored of him. I agree it wasn\u2019t a great way for Stolas to open the conversation, but I think having those worst fears seemingly going around in his head didn\u2019t help. A better way for Stolas to open things probably would have been for him to just say that he had an alternative option to the grimoire for Blitz\u00f8 to use.",
            "I wonder how it would have gone if he still had his happy pills.  \nStolas was probably operating on dangerously low serotonin.    \nHappy pills can fuck up your serotonin production when you take too much for too long. You stop producing your own so with no pills, it's crisis time!",
            "Stolas did not, however, start with that. \n\nHe jumps straight to \u201cyou don\u2019t have to fuck me if you don\u2019t want to\u201d without explaining why *first.* He obviously said it eventually but at that point Blitz was already spiraling; unbeknownst to Stolas he\u2019d been spiraling all day. People are not nearly equipped to handle confessions of love to begin with, and while I\u2019m not saying Stolas is exactly wrong in how he went about it, are any of us really surprised it went sideways?",
            "I think the roleplay was Blitz's unintentional answer, Stolas just interpreted it wrong. You can see that for a couple of seconds Stolas' confession does click with Blitz. But he's still in shock over the whole thing, he's deeply afraid of displeasing Stolas (remember: he still thinks Stolas wants to fuck), so he quickly diverts to \"oh okay, this must be a new roleplay thing\" and goes for it enthusiastically. He's clearly into the idea, on some level, just confused and not ready to fully commit. I get why Stolas didn't see it that way but to shut Blitz down mid-sentence... eep.\n\nBlitz has a lot to apologize for but I honestly don't think this night is one of them. He tried really hard to give Stolas what he thought he wanted, even bought him some new, very expensive looking toys, and was understandably angry when Stolas reacted how he did. I think everything that happened tonight was squarely on Stolas' shoulders. \n\nBlitz should *maybe* apologize for calling Stolas an asshole? But not because he was wrong to say so, Stolas was an asshole tonight. If their whole relationship is going to be Stolas dumping his emotions on Blitz and then shutting down completely when Blitz doesn't react exactly the way he wants him to or needs time to think, this isn't going to work.",
            "I don't think it was a bit. \n\nLike I legitimately believe because Blitz cares about Stolas and he was panicking at that point that the only way he could rationalize what was happening was because Stolas **wouldn't actually do that to him** that this __must__ be some sort of roleplay. \n\nI sincerely believe that Blitz did not understand that Stolas was being completely sincere, because Stolas didn't express that he wanted to have a conversation. \n\nBlitzo showed up for fuck night assuming they were going to fuck, and Stolas didn't disabuse him of that frame of reference, and he didn't stop to give Blitz a chance to process anything or answer his questions to clarify what was actually transpiring.\n\n\nBlitzo wasn't wrong. Stolas was doing exactly the thing Blitzo accused him of doing as a rich, pompous individual: Dismissing him because he's an Imp. \n\nHe did it before Blitzo even understood what was happening, and did it again by banishing Blitzo from the home right after Blitzo explicitly said that you don't get to just dismiss me like that. \n\nWhich is fucking painful.\n\n\nThe only wrong Blitzo had in this interaction was personally insulting Stolas. Stolas didn't consider how Blitzo would feel, or how to broach the subject, wasn't willing to even try to listen, and was in fact treating Blitzo the way Blitzo's insecurities make him feel: Like a disposable toy, and a servant.\n\nWhich is a huge problem, but an excellent nuanced take, and writing. The fact that they managed to convey Stolas was trying actively to remedy one power imbalance whilst embracing another more systemic one shows that sometimes people can even trying to do the right thing can royally fuck up.",
            "To be fair to Loona, Blitz half suspected Stolas was bored anyway. It's part of why he's panicking during the duet. And Loona knows how lonely Blitz is, and he's let it slip that he cares for Stolas a few times. Loona and M&M were probably worried that he was going to get upset, which is part of why they were following him. \n\nI liked the \"Daddy Daughter Day\" on the calendar and the banter between them. It looks like their relationship might be improving.",
            "He hates himself so much, and is so scared of affection, that the roleplay was his sarcastic/humorous way of responding. He should apologize for that because Stolas took it as mocking. The cherry on top of his insults - the one that made Stolas cry - was Blitz saying he's just like other blue bloods. He accused Stolas of embodying everything that Stolas hates and strives not to be. He took this as Blitz hating him and that broke his heart. \nAnd while Stolas was being an ass, it wasn't his intention. He was in a bad place before the meeting and got too caught up in his own head.",
            "Oh I get that he didn't take Stolas 100% seriously. He didn't want to believe it, so he thought it was a new game. \n\nAnd I agree with you on Stolas's behavior. He really was acting like a pompous, rich asshole. He doesn't realize that he's clueless about the lower classes and how they're treated by the upper classes. And the worst part, despite crying over those accusations, he just reinforced them more by kicking Blitz out: essentially treating Blitz like a toy he can throw away when he's sick of it. \n\nI know Blitz feels bad for making him cry, but I hope Stolas does some self reflection and realizes his own faults there. His behavior proves he's no more ready for a relationship  than Blitz is, and he can't carry that behavior over if he wants anything to work out."

            "Ah, man. That ending bit >!when Blitz sees that Stolas is crying and realizes his mistake, and tries to reach out as he's literally about to say \"I'm sorry\", but it's too late. I think most of us originally expected Blitz to storm out after misreading the situation, not for him to be the one who wishes he could go back at the last moment.!<Now I guess I'm really interested in seeing where Blitz goes from here.",
            "WHEN STOLAS STARTED CRYING, you can SEE the moment his heart BROKE! I can\u2019t. The way he said \u201cI think so very highly of you\u2026I didn\u2019t realize you think so low of me.\u201d Please, as someone who has went through the exact SAME thing in a relationship, this is\u2026A MASTERPIECE!!!!",
            "Honestly? Blitzo handled that better than I was expecting him to.",
            "Holy fuck that ending. I think everyone was fully expecting Blitz to misread the situation as Stolas pushing him away but no. This is so much better than a simple misunderstanding. Blitz fully understands the situation. Stolas genuinely loves him and that terrifies Blitz. The relationship is a actually getting to a place where it could work and Blitz might get the proper intimacy he's been craving but also scares him. All before he was able to self sabotage to escape the potential pain a genuine connection could bring like all his other relationships. So we get to see him driving people away properly this time. And Stolas did everything right. He was completely open and honest in what he wanted and how he felt. Its all on Blitz now. It always amazes me how well Viv gets these two.",
            "People are going to disagree with me because fans think Stolas can do no wrong, but I don\u2019t feel like he did everything right. Blitz def fucked up, but ahh it\u2019s genuinely heartbreaking when he\u2019s first >! literally begging he needs this, getting the crystal, and while he does immediately jump to sex, he\u2019s also saying that he can fuck him better in part to not lose the book but ALSO to not lose Stolas. He doesn\u2019t think Stolas is serious. And then he feels dismissed, because he is being dismissed, when Stolas just walks out without really talking to him at all and he doesn\u2019t have any time to process anything, so he gets angry. But they\u2019re both crying, in reality.!<\n\nIt\u2019s never been a one-sided communication issue and I\u2019ve personally always been able to see both sides. Ugh, looking forward to the rest of the season, hopefully the next episode is in early June.",
            "Really great; as always, I just wish it was longer. I think the B plot also might have worked better in another episode, but that's partly because I want more Stolas screentime.\n\nI don't really care about Cherubs or the DHORKS; the B plot wasn't bad, it was good. It's just not my preference of what I want to see.",

(Also of course after not speaking since episode 2 her first line is her being rude, wouldn\u2019t have it any other way)\n\nSeriously though, what a good episode. I liked the part where the cherubs were talking about what gets someone into heaven, which is interesting after watching hazbin.\n\nThe ending actually made me tear up a bit, watching blitz and stolas end their agreement.",

There\u2019s no miscommunication it\u2019s just Blitzo thinking so little of himself that he can\u2019t understand why anyone would have genuine feelings for him.",

            "Two other talking points I haven't seen anyone else mention: \n\nI think Blitz deserves some credit here. He really wanted to sort things out, and even when Stolas tried to end the conversation, he followed after him and tried to hash it out. The way he did it was very problematic, but this is the first time he's actively engaged in serious discussion with someone. And upon seeing how hurt Stolas is, he tries to say \"I'm sorry\" with no hesitation. So kudos to him for being willing to talk, even if it's problematic. \n\nNice try, IMP. We know your night stalking of Blitz wasn't just about your \"dumbass boss\" possibly losing the book. You were all legitimately worried he was going to have his heart broken by Stolas and didn't want him running around Hell making a fool of himself. You all try so hard to pretend you don't care as much as you actually do.",

I mean, the way he hesitated to shoot Blitz and his actions being performed with doubt overall show that he is the most compassionate and rational of the group, which will lead to him leaving. I just hope my boy gets a happy ending.",

            "So hyped for this but was ultimately disappointed when I realized this was just a setup for more Stolitz content to come. Was hoping the entire episode would be focused on it. As always, the craft is crazy high quality.\n\nI don\u2019t usually want entire episodes focused on something like that, but this was a HUGE moment for them. As much as I love the other cast, the Stolitz\u00f8 conversation needed time to breathe.",
            "I knew Stolitz was going to hit a wall. But I expected Blitz to be the one to fuck it up as he tends to, instead of Stolas, which was refreshing. \n\nStolas organised his confession poorly, expected an immediate answer, knowing Blitz has trust and self esteem issues, didn't want to entertain the idea to let Blitz explain the misunderstanding, and got pissy when Blitz rightfully called him out for treating him like one of his servants to be dismissed whenever he felt like it (We love to see Blitz advocating for himself!)\n\nStolas can't have it both ways. He can't claim he doesn't care about Blitz's lower station, then continue to treat him like a member of said station when trying to ask for a supposed equal relationship.   \nHe shut down any form of communication immediately.   \nAnd lets be real, our boy is AWFUL in his personal communication, with Blitz, and with Via. He simply shuts down what he doesn't want to hear. Didn't consider that if Blitz was following him, demanding the right to talk should have indicated he cared a great deal. \n\nWhich makes me wonder if he treated Stella similarly earlier in their relationship, which might have planted a seed towards her hatred of him. Not to dismiss or give reason for Stella's disgusting abuse. If Stolas neglected Stella with his awful communication skills and that thought is correct, she still chose to retaliate in an awful way. \n\nBut I digress. \n\nI love these two disaster demons. But goddamn do they make it hard on themselves!",

Moxxie's welcome to hell line in particular feels more like Loona or Millie line.\n\n* I was never that interested by the agents storyline and Im not sure how I feel about it making a return.\n\n* Minor tidbit I feel like 'Cherubs need to eat so they commit crime' is not the route I would have gone with for them? The motivation for them to do questionable things is already there as they have been kicked out of heaven and looking for revenge. I also dont know why they think killing IMP will get them back into Heaven, I would have gone with the 'nothing left to lose' route.\n\n* Big one: I dont really understand why this show is so averse to killing off characters.

He definitely has heard every vile in name in the book from Stella before, it just made him curl into himself hearing that from Blitz. The person he loved and wanted to have a real relationship with but is calling him that...Like damn. Teleporting Blitz out makes even more sense with that little detail in there",

On the surface level, she's the show's furry sex icon that pushes tons of merch sales, but it is extremely welcome when Loona is more than that.\n\nAnd the final meeting with Blitz and Stolas wrapped back around to the start of the episode.

            "Holy cow that ending though. >!I know some folk balk at poor communication/miscommunication between two people that obviously have feelings for each other and view it as a trope, but in this case it was done masterfully and in a way that's entirely in character for both Stolas and Blitzo. I took a quick glance at the comment section after finishing the episode and one put it nigh perfectly.!<\n\n>!\"Man, communication skills are so underrated. That entire final scene could have been smoothed over if they actually answered eachothers questions and explained themselves properly, instead of just talking over eachother and letting their own fears drown out everything. They both got so close to actually being heard. Blitz\u00f8 voiced his fears, and Stolas voiced his fears, but neither of them actually heard eachother. They only heard their own fears reflected back at them. They never actually heard eachother.\"!<\n\n>!The ordeal spoke volumes not just of how Blitzo and Stolas feel about each other, but how they're both so badly damaged that their fears of rejection and abandonment overrode all reason and they jumped to the worst possible conclusion. I'm still convinced that they're going to be a proper couple after all is said and done, but it's gonna be a long and painful road until we get there chums.!<\n\n#",

My guy, my dude, fucking wait a second.\n\nAs much as Blitz\u00f8 wasn't really listening to him, he wasn't listening when Blitz\u00f8 told him that he needed a minute to process things.\n\nBlitz\u00f8 absolutely shouldn't have sworn at him in response, but I can't really blame him for acting like that when Stolas truly was dismissing him for the entire conversation.\n\nIt's truly a sad instance of Stolas really just reaching the end of his rope to the point where he isn't even open to hearing anything that isn't what HE thinks is acceptable. \n\nAnd of Blitz\u00f8 essentially having the floor pulled out from under him and his greatest fears being thrown in his face.\n\nDefinitely progress, but there's still very much a communication problem between the two of them.",

Every second of them was oddly excruciating and I was very happy when the rest of the gang appeared so they wouldn't be taking up screen time on their own.\n\nI have no idea why, in concept they are.. fine? The VA are definitely doing specific voices for them... And I am used to love hating characters but it's almost like they appear and I am automatically excruciatingly bored.",

Instead, he is just obtuse enough to take Blitz's reaction as rejection and straight-up ejects him from his home, never really giving him a chance to respond to his confession. \n\nI feel like upcoming episodes (Apology Tour, in particular) are gonna involve a lot of Blitz realizing his mistakes, but I hope Stolis at least admits or confronts the fact that he was not fair to Blitz in how he approached his confession",

More like they had to kinda awkwardly squeeze the Dhorks stuff in here because they needed it for down the line, and could not fit it in any of the other upcoming episodes. It felt like the Blitz and Stolas scene was written, but then the rest of the episode had to be diverted to a anthology of scene for the rest of season 2's setup. \n\nWith that said, i kinda disagree that Moxie's 'Welcome to hell line' is a bit OOC, i feel the idea that Moxxie is alot more confident on his home turf so to speak, against enemies they have easily bested before, with the team backing him up, and his own general character growth.

            "Real talk: I think this episode is up there with Truth Seekers as one of THE BEST of the show! This season confrontation between Blitzo and Stolas was exactly what I was afraid was coming based on the trailer but it also fulfills the self-fulfilling prophecy Blitzo saw in his tripped out vision from Truth Seekers. We as the audience knows Blitzo wants nothing more than to be wanted and loved without there being a quid pro quo, and so his being taken aback and blindsidedness that happened when Stolas poured his heart out without ever alluding to that with Blitzo before, due to the social class double standards in the Demon Society of Hell led to a false sense of what was real to both of them and each one were already guarded and protecting themselves from each others inevitable hurts that they both ended up self-sabotaging because neither of them realized they actually both loved each other the same way, and it was only solidified when Blitzo was confused about Fizz and Ozzie being open about their relationship. He saw that as a ruse and couldn\u2019t think Stolas would be so cruel as to use his position to play with Blitzo\u2019s own heart and just throw him away like he was no longer needed. He saw the gift as a way out of the transaction that he thought his only choice was to put up his walls and guard himself from being hurt by the one he loved that he ended up being hurt. Just as Stolas didn\u2019t understand that the deep-seeded-hatred of the demon hierarchical society was so damaging to Blitzo that he didn\u2019t take into consideration that Blitzo didn\u2019t know whether or not this had always just been a transactional quid pro quo the entire time and he was just some play thing to be tossed aside at a moment\u2019s notice. Both were stuck in their own grief and pessimism that neither knew how each other truly felt and so neither knew how to react to each other when it came to truly being open to each other about their feelings.\n\nAs stated in a post/reply above, I might just be too invested in cartoon demon\u2019s lives and have no life of my own that I can meticulously pick apart what my interpretation is of what the writers were going for. I just really love these characters. Anyway\n\n12/10 masterpiece even with the subplot of the CHERUBS and DHORKS working together in their own quid pro quo scenario that was actually a pretty decent comic relief metaphor for how Stolas and Blitzo treated each other",

            "The last 5 minutes is such a gut punch \n\nAnd one of the reasons why it hurts so much is *because* Stolas did everything right, to drive the relationship towards something that was the healthiest either of them had ever been in and is all the more tragic because his honesty is rewarded with Blitz pushing him away \n\nWe can blame Blitz, but we can also understand where he's coming from because so much of who Blitz is who a lot of people can identify and empathize with, everything just HURTS",

            "Last scene was nice and all, but I have to say this I have few issues with it. First. Most of the episode was dedicated to rather unfunny and pointless filler. and second....\n\nWhile last scene is nice all I could think of when Stolas said \"I think so highly of you\" all I could think of is \"Why?!\" because after all this time I still have NO IDEA why Stolas loves Blitzo or why he cares so much. And Blitzo is kind of right. If anyone was making this sexual all the time it was Stolas in first episode of second season. But my BIG gripe with this ship as a whole is that they want to have all those powerful big scenes, but they failed at building them up. Same with HH. Why do you both care?! Why do you both love each other?! Where does any of that come from.\n\nStolitz as a ship needs more build up that Viv jumped over and now I am just confused and frustrated because last scene could work without the dumb pointless side story and with proper build up that makes this relationship feel real instead of something just being there for the sake of the plot.",
            "They lowkey fumbled this. Imagine hyping up \u201cthe talk\u201d for months, music video and all only for it to last a minute and the rest of the episode is just the characters fucking around and fighting",

I get the whole \"oh no I'm feelings but you're messing with me\" but this felt ENTIRELY like one of those typical movie plots of \n\n\"No. Wait! Let me explain\" and instead of someone running off abruptly stolas magics him away. Sure blitz was simply not buying it and no it's not that he thinks less of stolas directly but only after he, from blitz points of view, is suddenly being fucked with , does he react as such. Yeah I know I get it, it's adult animation but catered to a very specific demographic ((which only makes it less adult at times and more edgy teen)) but my goodness we've GOT to learn to not \"storm away\" like this and also stop using it as a means to push a difficult relationship as a story narrative. \n\nIt may be because I'm an old fart comparatively but it's so \"tired\" of a concept that it's more frustrating than empathetic as a reaction to watching. Like in the moment as they were having the big stand off at the windows I'm thinking \"oh noooo pull him towards you while he's looking away. Come on\" but instead it's \" NOPE SORRY TUNE IN NEXT WEEK\"\n\n\nAside from plot point.\n\n\nBut maybe it's just me but did the whole entire art style and animation seem, off?",

            "Yes me too. I thought for sure he'd bolt as soon as he suspected something was up, but he did want to talk things out.",
            "Absolutely!! I was so scared of a big miscommunication and us watching being like \u201cno that\u2019s not what he meant \ud83d\ude2d\u201d but Stolas actually articulated that he does really really care for Blitz and still wants him around, it\u2019s just on Blitz\u2019s end that things are messy but hopefully Blitz does all the self-work necessary to earn Stolas back",
            "I feel like Stolas really needed to give Blitz\u00f8 a minute to process. I'm actually so proud of Blitz\u00f8 that he FOLLOWED Stolas, and was there, and was willing to talk it out before he got yeeted. I actually feel like this shows a lot of growth for them both even though it hurts.",
            "Blitz reaction wasn't self sabotage and was legitimate imo. He comes from a society of being a repressed underclass race, his and Strikers beef are both legit in their society, and Stolas used him for a long time as a tool and plaything. Stolas has been advertising his feelings for a while and Blitz took those, coming off the trauma of abuse Stolas had dolled out leading up to that, as mockery. His anger at Stolas being legitimately in love with him I don't think it just Blitz being unable to love, its specfically him being unable to love an abuser.\n\nBut then again, it could go either way, and thats what I love about this character dynamic. They both are wrong and right at the same time, about basically everything. While Blitz externally looks like hes fucking everything up more often and worse, its Stolas that is truly alone and aimless now - Blitz' business is succeeding, his coworkers watch his back and legit see him as found family. Hes fixed his broken childhood friendships. Stolas has only lost everyone, fallen from grace, and self-isolated himself in a depressive and fixated spiral that is leading him to oblivion. For all Blitz' inability to be happy, Stolas is the one that is consistently miserable. Blitz just can't recognize what he has, but he has it all, and Stolas has nothing.",
            "I just want to yell \u201cin the name of all that is holy! JUST TALK YOUR MORONIC HELLSPAWN AND LOVE EACH OTHER ALREADY!!! Gah!\u201d At them so they can finally get their shit together!",
            "The only thing I'll add that is a negative to Stolas is that he was very controlling of the conversation, not letting Blitz think for a minute once the truth was actually getting through to him. Yes, in the end, Blitz hurt Stolas when he vented about how the relationship had felt like for him and how that was hurting Blitz. However, Stolas seemed to expect either an immediate acceptance <and hoped for> or an outright rejection, which Blitz reinforced with the intentional and unintentional self sabotage.\n\n\nTo summarize, while Blitz did fuck up here, because the relationship had always been transactional and they never had a real understanding of each other...Blitz thought too little of himself to believe Stolas was genuine until the last second. And Stolas thought too much of Blitz to think he may not be able to speak on his feelings.",
            "What gets me about it is how accurate it is to self-sabotaging. Blitz through the whole scene is just operating off a mental script, that he's probably rehearsed in his head for years. When Stolas gives him a chance to be open about why he can't understand why a royal would care about him he automatically goes to venting about what the hierarchy in hell has put him through unfiltered. He never thought this could ever happen, it's just too much for him all at once, and he can't switch gears, if he had time to \"process\" maybe it could have gone more smoothly. Tragic.",
            "Yeah, Stolas screwed up BIG TIME. He came across as defeated/disinterested in Blitz until he mentioned wanting Blitz to come over by choice. But being dismissive prior to that didn't help.....he thought Stolas was fucking with him partly because of his dismissive demeanor. The self hatred would have won anyway, but Stolas went about it in a mixed message kind of way. He completely missed how much Blitz was panicking the whole time.",

That this show was pitched as slapstick hijinks and that episodes like The Circus are pushing the actual narrative too much, but I'm really here for the narrative now writers, its ok to just have it make me cry for 30 minutes straight.",
            "I mean the Stolas and Blitz\u00f8 plot didn't need any more set up than what it got...It deliver what it was trying to do quite well, so no need to extend it to cover the entire episode.\n\nAlso the crystal that Stolas gave to Blitz\u00f8 might be incredibly important for both A and B plot...I mean that crystal might be useful to fully open the portal DHORKS are trying to build and Stolas might need to come to the rescue yet again. Like Asmodian crystal entire deal is the ability to open portals.",
            "I actually really enjoyed the B plot, especially because it set up more to come from those threads later.",
            "Honestly it was bad, in my opinion, in that it only detracted from an otherwise solid episode. It simply wasn't needed and took screen time away from the more interesting plot, like the Loona hospital sequence.",

            "I guess because both plots are more connected than people think. I mean the Stolas and Blitz\u00f8 plot was both going there own ways and Stolas giving a item that might be really important for a certain portal...I mean the crytal entire deal is making portals.",

            "The problem is that he already looked upset and focused on the book first. He kind of confirmed (in Blitz's mind) that he was bored of him, then transitioned to how much he cared. I think Blitz took it as a mixed message due to his self loathing - he focused more on their arrangement ending than he did Stolas's love confession.",
            "Nah, I think Stolas could have communicated better. He probably shouldn't have opened the conversation by saying he was taking back the Grimoire right away with no supporting context, of course, that's gonna cause Blitz to panic.\n\nIn my opinion, he should've immediately opened with the Asmodean Crystal then after explaining what it does and what it's about then say he was taking him Grimoire back. It would've spared Blitz the panic of thinking he was going to lose the lifeline to his career.\n\nStolas should've explained more clearly that he felt he was keeping Blitz tied down, explaining what he believes were his shortcomings, which is why he wanted to void the deal they had. It would've help prevented Blitz from thinking Stolas was blaming him, and helped Blitz to understand that Stolas was doing all this for his sake.\n\nOne really important thing Stolas forgot to do was explicitly ask Blitz on his thoughts on the matter. Stolas completely neglected to ask Blitz on what he was feeling, until it eventually blew up as that self-destructive and vitriolic rant which left them both feeling bitter.",

Media literacy is DEAD in this fandom!\n\nEdit: I've also seen someone on DeviantArt say that \"The fans already have wrote the entire show for vivziepop\" which just translates to \"The fans wrote the show in a direction that goes the way I want it to go so therefore Vivziepop is bad\"",

I wish we could have gotten a scene or two that led up to them following Blitz. That might have helped.",
            "I felt that way so much, especially with Moxxie, the most notable being his line on 16:09 with \"welcome to hell, bitch\" like I genuinely had the look on my face of \"the fuck?\" It did not feel like him, yk?",

I get that it's there for comic relief but it feels... Misplaced. I got the impression the show was kinda evolving into something more mature (while keeping all the raunchy stuff and the edgy jokes and language), with lots of interesting and developing characters. 10 minutes of a 23 minute episode of Powerpuff girls x Happy Tree Friends just doesn't fit, in my humble opinion.",

            "I\u2019m kind of watching this show for that but mainly for Stolitz which is the main hook of the show. And as Viv said, the show is all about Blitz\u00f8 and his relationships",
            "I think it\u2019s really clear the Stolas loves Blitzo because his life has been so utterly void of any contentions with other people that the attention that Blitz gives him (limited and conditional though it may be) was basically addictive to him.  Especially since he was way to passive to reach out to anyone on his own and Blitzo came into his life and gave him everything he\u2019d wanted. It\u2019s super unhealthy, but it makes sense.",
            "Stolas likes Blitz because he simply resonates with him that way; he finds his jokes funny, antics appealing. He also states multiple times that he teached him how to choose and take action. Blitz likes Stolas because he is the only one to truly accept him as who he is, he doesn't see it that way though.\n\nHave you been watching the last two whole seasons where Stolas and Blitz's relationship parasitically slurped up viewtime?",
            "There's a lot of stuff that is blink and you'll miss it. For example, if you read the Stolitz messages, Stolas is very accommodating and kind towards Blitz. There's actually a decent content through the text messages. To me I feel like I've seen it build up a decent bit, especially considering the whole \"Stolas can get hurt?\" Line - it's a lot of subtle things that build up to show their relationship\n\nEDIT: I do agree the side plot was unnecessary. I was so frustrated but the end makes up for it to me",
            "I feel like the song in the beginning does both of those things pretty well",
            "I think he thinks highly of Blitz for several reasons: his freedom, being himself, his sense of humor, showing him affection, and being his crass self without caring what anyone thinks. It's the wild, brave, humourous side to him that Stolas fell for.",
            "Stolashas always had a crush on Blitz from when they were kids, look at how he reacts when he first sees him, Blitz sparked something new in Stolas's depressed life and his personality was able to thrive after dumping Stella, Stolas also fell for Blitz because he made Stolas feel happy.\n\nBlitz, on the other hand, has been a lot more subtle. It started out purely transactional for Blitz and his inferiority complex towards Royalty made it hard for him to believe Stolas really cared about him, so he in turn thought Stolas was only interested in sex and didn't open his heart to him, but then Stolas saved his life from the D.H.O.R.K.S and he felt vulnerable, and after finding out Stolas can be hurt in Western Energy he realized Stolas can be vulnerable as well.\n\nAll this to say Blitz and Stolas do genuinely love each other, but Blitz is afraid of intimacy, and right now Stolas doesn't think Blitz wants him out of love.",
            "I agree with you when you said how because Stolas is sexual with him all the time, he's going to believe that that's all he wants from him and thinks of him, which we know Blitz has always thought of Stolas that way, so how would he know Stolas has feelings? Besides that it's kinda obvious that Stolas has reasons to love Blitz. I also don't think Blitz was in the right, like he literally hurt another person in his life AGAIN and ruined their relationship bc of how he reacted, but that was kind of expected that he would push Stolas too far in this ep which apparently surprised a lot of people for no reason? Like what were you expecting him to do?he's always been like this with others and pushing people away, and now that this ep is over, he's starting to realize his mistakes and learning to let other's in like Fizz. It pissed me of how mad people were at Blitz for no reason but I guess I can see why people are angry.",
            "I think it\u2019s understandable though. Things need to get worse before they can get better between them. Sometimes it\u2019s an entire journey of understanding between two people before they reach a happy ending",
            "I\u2019m pretty sure the entire show is about them eventually getting together",
            "I think if they pushed through and mended things, if Blitz opened up once he got enough time to process everything, and Stolas realizes that Blitz is mostly struggling with himself (although in Look My Way, he seemed to have an idea about that..?), etc., then they\u2019ll be on the right track. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s where the show is heading in regard to their relationship (and based off what we see in the trailer). They\u2019re both going through adversity, but that just makes me even more invested. Getting to see the rocky journey there means I\u2019ll feel so overjoyed if and when they work out. Thats why they are my favorite pair.\n\nI think they can be good for each other. Stolas is very openly loving, affectionate, and that could be healing for someone like Blitz. It would help Blitz face his insecurity, self-worth issues, as well as finally go against his fixed perspective of being inferior, of never being able to be on the same level as \u2018royals\u2019 who wouldn\u2019t care for imps like him anyways, let alone develop a relationship with one. Not only that, Blitz just doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s worth loving and hates himself. Ozzie refused to let Fizz think that way at all, being so supportive that he is. I want Stolitz to eventually reach a point where they can be that sweet and uplifting together.\n\nThey\u2019ve got similar childhoods in daddy issues. They both love their daughters. Stolas loves Blitz\u2019s sense of adventure and humor. They get along well if you take away the drama. Stolas even takes pictures of his horse drawings. Blitz will clearly do anything for the people he loves. He\u2019s a very loyal guy. Once he lets someone in, he\u2019s a ride-or-die. They both have the potential to be great partners.\nBut this is just what I think",
            "You know, I've had a LOT of unpleasant things to say about this show's fans since season 2 began, but, up until now, I've never had cause to call the fans \"ungrateful.\" But I guess I can throw that out the window, too.\n\nEDIT: I meant to say \"I NEVER had cause\"",
            "My god, the entitlement. That\u2019s how this show is funded. No one\u2019s forcing you to buy any merch and you can still ***watch the episodes for free.***\n\nIf a commercial triggers you so bad, here\u2019s the door. \ud83d\udeaa",

            "I think part of it is because it made him realize in that moment that he has hurt Stolas, just like his hurt so many others before, like a ringing memory from all the other times he's done just that.",
            "Stolas started off wrong by focusing on the book first. After he made Blitz think he was bored, then he said he had feelings for him. I think Stolas felt so defeated from the start and Blitz was in panic mode the whole time.",
            "Yes this makes me so happy (and sad)! I was fully expecting typical misunderstanding that was gonna just make me frustrated, but this was so well done!",
            "Im sure he was willing to give Blitz time to process, but instead of taking that time Blitz went straight into dismissing Stolas' feelings by saying it's just roleplay and acting out saying he loves Stolas back in a really condescending way",
            "I love this different perspective! Everyone focuses on love they suppose to have, but yeah, it\u2019s a long path. Stolas is aware that their deal makes it hard/impossible for Blitz to believe him.\n\nI think you might be right, Blitz is not self-sabotaging, he is overwhelmed by the situation. He was thinking just a moment ago their regular deal was gone (and his whole business with that), but the next second he had to face expectations from a higher class regarding emotional closeness.",
            "Yeah i think it shows how this is very much not one sided in regards to both of them being not very good partners, Blitz is quite flippant with their relationship and never seems to take Stolas very seriously in regards to it, thinking that his own self loathing indicates how everyone else feels about him, tolerant to him, provided he has a use to them, and lets not understate here Blitz has been disregarding Stolas alot and trying to ignore any earnest talks, and he did lash out here badly, but knowing what we do he really was backed in a corner, both by himself and by Stolas.\n\nStolas posits that he is truly hurt that Blitz thinks so low of him when he thought so highly of Blitz, yet Stolas never stood up for Blitz at Ozzies, he constantly objectifies him, and even here he he treated it as a storybook romance and assumed any response from Blitz that was not overwhelming acceptance was a indication of rejection and just railroaded the entire conversation until Blitz lashed out and pointed out, in crass terms, that Stolas just put him on the spot after throwing alot at him in very mixed way, and then Stolas's own baggage reared up being yelled at and he sent Blitz away, still not giving him the opportunity to really internalize the conversation and from how this went i doubt he will even give Blitz's a avenue of communication to have a follow up. \n\nStolas was ready to see any sign as a indication they were on the worst outcome that he refused to see Blitz's own feelings and body language and understand this was him panicking, and Blitz was so ready to see any signs of his worst outcome he could not see that while Stolas order of communication was rough, he was genuine.",
            "I actually really, really like that the problem between the two is so complex that it can't be solved just by talking. They need to work through some shit about themselves and with each other, and it isn't just a simple misunderstanding that can be explained and fixed.",
            "ikr I'm actually crushed. Stolas laid his heart out on a plate and Blitz did that. If he wasn't my favourite character Id be so pissed.",
            "Exactly\u2014and I thought it was so sad when Blitz immediately brought up Stolas\u2019 butlers. The fans love Stolas but it\u2019s not just the plaything comment or their arrangement\u2014the cheek pinching, calling Moxxie and Millie little ones, and even though it\u2019s comedic effect, both he and Stella throw and squeeze their staff. Like, their class divide is huge and Stolas has played into it.",
            "That was all I could think of when they said it would be extra special.",
            "I'm glad it didn't. If the B plot had more significant character moments, it just would've distracted from the Blitz\u00f8/Stolas plot.\u00a0\n\n\nIt was solid comic relief, and set up more to come later. That's fine.",
            "From the trailer we can tell we are gonna see Dhorks again this season so it might lead to something",
            "I don't think they're scared, I think VP really likes both comedy and drama. But I think the show is at its best when the comedy is woven more into its drama, such as Harvest Moon, Truth Seekers, Ozzie's, and The Circus.\n\nI think their scenes and episodes that attempt to be purely comedy tend to fall flatter because I have less investment.\n\nThat's not to say I think any of the episodes is \\*bad\\*, not even CHERUBs, but I think the episodes I mentioned earlier are 12/10ers and this was a 9/10er. The priest army is an amusing gag, but it's not something I need to come back and see over and over.",
            "It was a huge B plot, too. There was more time dedicated to it than the actual Blitzo/Stolas stuff. I've heard some critics say that Medrano likes to throw all the characters and the kitchen sink into an episode, and I can definitely see it here.",
            "Ugh...whyde you have to go and remind me of that atrocious F plot that just ate up screen time",
            "It's comical coming from someone who's complaining about a preference.",
            "I don't mind B plots. I've defended B plots that other people disliked, like that in Western Energy. \n\nAlso re-watching I realize that Stolas and Blitz are basically the B plot of this episode... it's almost half as short as DHORKS and CHERUBs.\n\n  \nAnd for what it's worth, I enjoyed their scenes. But based on the episode title I was hoping it would be more about Stolas, especially when the episode itself was only 23 minutes.",
            "Friend, if I\u2019m being real, you\u2019re turning toxic yourself on this thread in your effort to confront any supposedly toxic commenters.\n\nWhich, well, will accumulate a bit as the day goes on, but which haven\u2019t really posted yet.",

            "I mean, it's possible Helluva takes place after the series finale of Hazbin (whenever that is/whatever happens in it) and thus Helluva has an entirely different status quo than what we know from Hazbin.\n\nLike, it's possible Lute is dead, the exterminations have stopped, and the exorcists have been disbanded. We don't really have a way of knowing without tying Hazbin and Helluva more closely together, which can't happen because Amazon has a deal re: Hazbin (which is likely part of why there was such a long gap between Helluva episodes and why we're getting them more often now - Amazon wanted some exclusivity period for Hazbin).\n\nThat's all speculation, of course, but I don't think we'll get answers for quite a while.",

Not that I entirely blame Blitzo \u2014 he found comfort in the deal and he liked pretending that he could be with someone and it be purely transactional, to have that ripped away from him would be a shock.",

What reason did IMP have to spare them when they came to their own turf to kill them?\n\nI remember seeing a tweet of Vivs saying something like 'why do I have so many characters'.

And Stolitz needs more scenes where relationship is properly explored. Because feelings of both Blitzo and Stolas are needlessly vague and that makes me care less about this conflict as it feels like it's more spice than proper meat. The same problem HH has. If you want to make this big relationship drama you need build up, proper exploration of why those feelings exist, where they come from before you start playing with them. Instead here it feels like whoever writes has no patience for it and we could have gotten some exploration of that WITHOUT THE DUMB CHERUBS. \n\nAlso was that Holy tranquilizer and lightning? How were they affected by it, they are Angels.",
            "I did. But I could not tell for instance with jokes if Stolas finds him funny just because or because he already has a crush on him as we only ever see him care about him after getting first sight crush (which btw I still do not like, it's such a lazy plot point). Blitzo taught him to take action and decide? We barely saw any of that and in this season it's already confused as to why they came back so quickly to one another after Ozzie's debacle.\n\nAs for \"accepting him for who he is\" doesn't Millie also do that already? She doesn't seem to care about his antics at all. Even when he insults Moxxie. Who while he complains sometimes about he still seems to be all about being his friends so... that kind of falls flat.\n\nListen. I would prefer for this relationship to have proper build up and exploration that is not broken up by something as stupid as the Cherub one. Because both of those tonally Clash as well so much that it's even harder for me to take seriously.\n\nAnd Stolas's words \"I think so hhighly of you\" and what is that high thing about Blitzo? What is it?",
            "And that's the problem. Blink and you miss it. I'm sorry, but that's not how it works. You need to earn those scenes. And to earn it you need proper build up that is more than few lines that you slap in a scene somewhere. You need to earn this resolution.",

            "Yep. Right from the musical number at the start we can see that Stolas is depressed about forcing the issue, and Blitz is full of nervous energy about not being intimate with Stolas for a while. I really feel for Blitz here because I do the same. The longer a stretch between intimacy, the harder that gap seems to cross to go back to where it started. And even so, I recognize that's my own issue, yet at the same time...it's hard to fix.",
            "I think Stolas was unfair at the end too. Blitz had always been under the impression this was just about sex and when he realized Stolas was serious Stolas had already decided it was over and didnt give Blitz a chance to even process the situation for a moment and say what he really feels. Their relationship is complicated and full of misunderstandings and Stolas had been thinking about it for a very long time, Blitz had a few minutes",

A large B plot could have worked, but it needed some kind of thematic or logical connection to Blitz and Stolas' relationship. \n\nThe cherubs have absolutely no connection to Stolas or Blitz's love life, and poor Stolas doesn't have any role in most of the episode as a result. \n\nIt's jarring just how random the mixing of these two plots is",

You can't look at a few opinions and assume a consensus, or think badly of an entire fandom or their critical thinking skills because you've zoomed in on the complaints. I spend a lot of time on Reddit and Twitter sides of the fandom and I haven't heard a truly bad word spoken about the majority of episodes on that list (especially 6 and 7, are you kidding me?! Two of the most beloved episodes of the series!). I think focusing less on the negative opinions would do you well.",
            "The funny thing is my father (who is 66 btw) believes Happy Campers was actually the best episode the series has put out to date! I also really enjoyed it and 100% understood precisely why Moxxie and Millie were portrayed the way they were in human disguise.  Moxxie\u2019s own self esteem and confidence in himself has always been dictated by others and so him seeking outside approval and getting jealous makes perfect sense to the character. Even so much as humiliating his wife to try and gain the approval because he knows she supports him no matter what, and so in his mind he was justified in his actions and only when he was opened to the idea that maybe that was wrong of him to do did he actually see Millie was hurting that she had to go to those Lengths to make her husband feel better about himself, even if that part wasn\u2019t as present to the story because it was only towards the end it happened. \n\nMillie\u2019s made sense because she\u2019s always upbeat and has been loved by literally everyone who comes into contact with her because she\u2019s a southern girl and southern hospitality bakes the automatic Rizz into the human disguise because she oozes positivity and friendliness. She literally didn\u2019t she to do anything at all to make people like her because by her nature she is liked no matter what. So what worked so well is when she realized how much it hurt Moxxie to not have that instant approval by the camp goers it became too much for her to bare and she let herself be hurt to make Moxxie happy. I might have read too much into it and I may not have a life outside of fictional cartoon demons but Moxxie is my spirit animal because I constantly require everyone\u2019s approval and have to feel like I need to be liked or I amounted to nothing and deserve nothing.",

Probably several. Blitz was cruel about it, but you could hardly expect otherwise. And while We know Stolas see Blitz as his equal, he only started minding his own casual classism After Ozzy's. Blitz was used to being treated like a manservant by Stolas, they'd been in person with each other once since that time.\n \nObviously Blitz's *everything* got deeply in the way. He is far from faultless.

Episode 2 really raised the bar of this show and episode 3 was fairly entertaining on it's own while also expanding on Blitz's past lovelife somewhat, which helped build up future conflict between him and Stolas.

I enjoyed it, I could understand people not liking it (which is okay), but they needed a reason for Blitz to see, first hand, that Stolas could be killed. He could have gone to see it if he had gone to fight Striker, but didn't.
