            "I'm not sure why there isn't discussion about women being biologically unsuitable to work and therefore being less valuable.\n\nWomen are designed to have children. It's nature. That requires pregnancy, a medical condition where a woman is eventually unable to do any meaningful physical labor. After the pregnancy, a woman is more likely to take time off work or a leave of absence to focus on their child due to maternal instinct.\n\nAll of this leads to a man in the same job being more valuable. They won't become pregnant and be unable to do physical labor. They are less likely to take time off for child raising than women. The value in training a man at your company and promoting them is therefore greater since they are likely to stay in the workforce longer and more consistently. \n\nAt the end of the day, it's just simple economics that a man is more valuable than a woman as an employee. \n\nEven if you completely remove physical ability, intelligence, or skill from the equation it's simply the aspect of pregnancy, maternal instinct, and raising children that makes a woman on average less valuable than a man to an employer.",
            "\n\n>When people talk about the pay gap, do they talk about bosses choosing to pay women less, or do they acknowledge that is not the issue, and focus more on why women don't get into higher paying jobs/work longer days?\n\nHonestly, the points you raise very rarely get talked about unless it's someone challenging the wage gap narrative. Those complaining about it generally present the argument as though your average worker doing the exact same role will have a 30% pay differential depending on their sex.\n\n>Things like how parenthood is dealt with in families or how attitudes and expectations affect the girls' education choices? Or her personality and self-image, how to be assertive and believe in her strengths?\n\nI think this is a common misconception for a few reasons. Yes there are generally different family roles with parenthood but this is presented as forced upon women or by \"oppressive patriarchy\" whereas both statistically and anecdotally there is just simple preference differences between the sexes and their maternal instincts. To give the anecdotal, Im from the UK and have an almost 1 year old daughter. My partner is fairly senior in healthcare and was a \"rising star\" so to speak being one of the youngest to reach her level of seniority. She earns marginally more than myself but much more with overtime. She was always working on past her finish time etc and quite career orientated. She then fell pregnant, accidentally but we were both delighted. She had 9 months maternity leave once our daughter was born due to the general public sector maternity package within her job (I'm private sector construction so got 3 weeks paternity leave). She has recently gone back to work, flat out refuses to work past her 5pm finish time and is devastated not to be at home with our daughter. I personally would have liked more time off too but thems the breaks. My partner's attitude to work has totally changed since becoming a mother and now all she wants to do is spend as much time at home with our daughter as possible.\n\nOn education choices there are a number of large scale experiments where societal attitudes have actually promoted STEM subjects to female students, particularly in Scandinavia and the results have been the complete opposite to what was expected i.e. women choosing less STEM and more caring professions like nursing and teaching etc. There are ingrained sex differences and people who view everything as a social construction can't seem to grasp this. Watch little boys and girls play with toys and this is obvious to anyone.\n\nPersonality and self image/being assertive. Being assertive is a typically masculine trait, it stems from the aggression part of our brains and men are typically more aggressive (look at prison populations if you doubt this). Again, the women who reach senior roles tend to have a lot of these masculine traits but they are not typical. Taking it to a basic level, if a guy is going to go after pay rises and be blunt in negotiations Vs a woman who will just wait to be awarded a pay rise, who is going to get one more often than the other? It's just basic psychology.\n\nDoes all of the above seem unfair? A bit yes, but it's reality. Men and women benefit and are disadvantaged in many different ways in different scenarios, it's just a fact of life.",
