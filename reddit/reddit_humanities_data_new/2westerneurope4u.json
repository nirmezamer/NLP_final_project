            "Is Bavaria it's own country? I genuinely don't know.\n\nScotland is its own country with its own parliament and PM.\n\nWales has it's own \"senate\" but is less separate from England due to joining earlier and being less arsed about said joining as time has gone on (and about a lot of things in general). It is however it's own country legally and culturally.\n\nNorthern Ireland is a bit of a weird one because of the whole civil war thing and the fact that they are barely functioning, so I was surprised they had their shit together enough to arrange a football team (no offence to them, well some offence)."

Unfortunately it does neither of does things, quite the opposite. \n\nThese kids are confused, insecure and have no sense of self worth, and it doesn't get better by our status driven, materialistic, hyper 24/7 fake media world where you can create a complete fake image of yourself to create a false sense of self worth and status that starts to take over your real self and it prohibits you from finding your inner self.\n\nI see it with native europeans too but the difference is, this is our homeland, these are our people, our culture, our home. We are raised to respect these things and we have an inner desire to do so because we connect them with where we belong to. \n\nUnfortunately some foreigners don't have that desire to integrate, neither do their parents, they don't give a shit about values and they do not want to integrate and contribute to a working society, it's all about themselves so they act like a monkey towards everyone in the pursuit of fake worth, fake status and fake respect in their fake little world. \n\nThis is one of the distinguishing factors between america and europe, america is more driven by looking for yourself and europe is driven by looking out for one another. The thing that distinguishes america from other foreigners tho is that they also learned to live in a society similair to us and still integrate and do ones job and be part of a functioning society aswell as europe is basically their ancestral homeland. \n\nTl;dr: foreigners with no roots here, no desire to put down roots + our materialistic, online media dystopian world is non bueno.",

            "I mean, it's like you're missing \u00be of my points but ok.\n\nAlso, as far as I'm concerned, I don't fully get the whole French-most romantic language thing if I'm honest, I get it to some degree but I can't quite explain why it's so exaggerated in non French's psyche. I'm sure there is combo of culture and other factors etc... but my point is, I don't particularly see it myself. I find Italian far more \"romantic\" (whatever that means in terms of actual sounds).\n\nAlso, lol at your two examples, those songs make me want to drown. Definitely not what would come to my mind if I try to summon romantic French music to my mind.\n\nhaha as for the \"average\" person, well here's your keyword \"average\" - I could personally speak French to you the way you envision as well as as if I owned 3 ch\u00e2teaux and 40 horses, it would certainly not be the same vibe at all.",

My only defense is that a surprising number don\u2019t.\n\nEnglish/German combo helps me decipher a surprising amount of *written* Dutch, Danish and Norwegian.\n\nFrench, I just can\u2019t even. And I\u2019ve attempted French, Spanish and Italian at basic levels.",
            "Hey, im not trying to pretend as though im deeply involved in french songs, which is why those two came to mind. Of course its depressing as all hell, but isnt that what love is about?\n\nIf I take the best examples of \"beautiful\" german, than it can hold its candle to every other language, exactly because of those long words (neologisms) and a few grammatical tricks german is quite suited for poetry. Not to mention technical manuals, but that aside.\n\nNo language is pretty or ugly, its the way we use it. And the french I have heard in the past (a third of my family is french) can be just as harsh and ugly as german.",

            "It's ok, no need for an apology, I personally felt bad for shining light on it, and incidentally reinforcing the stereotype that Germans are impermeable to humour.\n\nI'm not surprised by what you said about French, I wouldn't expect it any other way. But what you can do with dutch, I can do with Italian and Spanish to a lesser degree. Portuguese ... is well doable but it's a wild different thing still.\n\nAlso, something that I always find funny is that, whether the person is a native or English second language, if one is truly fluent in English, one actually has a decent French starting pack. But it's just not realised. There are so many words, expressions, and verbs that are commonly used in modern English that are actually close enough to current French that it's like having a bit of a dual database.",
            "Baza. Powodzenia!",
            "Honestly, I was taught French for years at a UK school and got top marks. In the over 20 years since then, it\u2019s totally evaporated. I can probably read it out loud and not be totally incomprehensible, maybe.\n\nEdit: actually, I can still read a complete menu, without assistance, according to my last Paris trip.\n\nI also think French is taught badly. The pronunciation I was taught in the classroom was nothing like what I was actually faced with on my first school trip to France."
