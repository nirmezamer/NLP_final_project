The distribution is intended to fill the needs of those contributing to it, rather than trying to appeal to as many users as possible. It is targeted at the proficient GNU/Linux user, or anyone with a do-it-yourself attitude who is willing to read the documentation, and solve their own problems.",
            "speaking of the changing computing landscape, how many people realistically start their Linux journey with arch, anyway? We should probably start by understanding our demographic first.\n\nArch is primarily maintained by volunteers, so support will be a big issue. doesn't help that arch project itself expects the users to have prerequisite background in information technology to actually understand the wiki.\n\nlike sure archinstall, but I'm not really buying it, given that it does not support dual boot on a single drive. something many other distro installers (from the more user friendly distros) support and even take pride in. asking a newbie to have another drive to \"back up\" their data before they even start using Linux is gonna be a hard sell, when their first computer probably comes with zero effort windows setup and the only \"back up\" they have to deal with is onedrive.",
            "I feel I need to add something to this;\n\nWhen I co-founded this sub back in 2008 with Kousi, one of our key missions from the beginning had been to oppose the elitism and RTFM that even back then was near constant in the community. \n\nInstalling Arch back then felt like you'd climbed a real mountain and very few ever made it. \n\nIt felt like asking for help with your very first Arch install was met with people literally telling you to RTFM and refusing to actually help you.\n\nWe wanted to break that cycle, and make this sub a place where brand new users could come, regardless if they'd read the wiki or not, and ask for help that itself might be contained in the wiki, but maybe they'd failed to search the wiki properly for it. Its built in search engine wasn't the best, and if the person concerned wasn't fluent in English and using Google Translate, it could make using the wiki VERY difficult; It still is in fact. \n\nThe Arch Wiki, whilst a great store of information is still very difficult to use if English isn't your native language. \n\nSo welcoming brand new users who struggle with the wiki, and have been pushed out of the IRC channels, is possibly the PRIME mission of this sub. It seems I might have to iterate this point in the rules or something.",
            "**tl;dr:** We will have to come to terms with growing numbers of zero-effort posts in r/archlinux whether we like it or not. Trying to gatekeep Arch newcomers by shunning things like archinstall or quitting the subreddit in protest because we don't like the way they post questions (as infuriating as it can be) isn't going to make Arch better in the long run.\n\n...\n\nI only have a few months of Arch under my belt, though I did spend a some years cutting my teeth with Debian (and, to a lesser extent, Pop!\\_OS). I can say, with confidence, that the switch to Arch has increased my understanding of Linux and low-level processes tenfold because of its DIY nature, great documentation (albeit flawed in some regards), and passionate fast-acting community. This, in turn, has fueled my desire to give back by helping out those that I can on this subreddit since I'm not a developer and unfortunately have little/no ability to contribute to growing Arch under the hood.\n\nThat said, I'm also the kind of person who's unafraid to dig through man pages, github/gitlab issue trackers, defunct forum posts, and, of course, Reddit to find answers I need as quickly as possible. Posting a new question is hands-down the absolute last resort when I've exhausted everything I can dig up myself -- if anything, I simply don't want to wait hours or days for a solution when there's a good chance it's out there if I look hard enough. When we speak of changing landscapes, though, the reality is that people like \"us\" are becoming fewer and more far between because there are now the equivalent of two generations of folks whose entire lives have existed within the realm of having access to instantaneous information. For them, posting a what we would consider a \"zero effort\" question and getting someone's response in 'real time' is akin to us making a quick google search because that's what their entire lives have consisted of and how they've interacted with the world up to this point (and I'm not saying this in a condescending way, it's just a fact of how our societies are evolving for better or worse). Heck, we're even seeing a major shift of focus to low-code/high-level programming tools and new education dedicated to learning how to build AI prompts that will software for us nowadays. It's unavoidable that folks whose entire lives have consisted of interacting with computers in this manner are going to seek out answers in the manner they are familiar with which may not jive with how so-called \"purists\" have been doing things up to this point and would like to continue seeing going forward.\n\nI do, however, think that we should encourage/enforce newcomers to actively engage with the subreddit, not just post one-and-dones without follow up (e.g., not posting a thanks or the outcome of trying the suggestions they've been provided). There's already r/linux4noobs which caters to Linux newcomers and likely has higher tolerance for that kind of stuff, hence I think r/archlinux should expect a somewhat higher standard among its posters.",
            "Arch is maintained by highly knowledgeable experts, and those that help users in a forum like this Reddit are too. I don't think the aim should be to make Arch a pleasant experience for newbies at all. The aim should be to keep it a pleasant experience for those skilled and experienced Linux hackers. Imho, that means to keep things as they were. So what is changing that requires change? I believe only one thing: Arch has gotten the attention of the masses it is more popular. That has resulted in an influx of non-experienced more \"common\" users. The result of that is a flood of the so called zero-effort questions that change the feel of this community (the Reddit one) and might even chase the skilled experts that are helping away. \n\nI think we have to acknowledge this change and take measures to keep the experts, to keep Arch the dist for competent Linux enthusiasts\n\nIt seems unavoidable that this means a harsher moderation that demands effort (reading the wiki trying things out and only asking for help once you can give a report of what one tried what the results were and where you got stuck)..",
            "In my view, the only truly annoying posts are ones which clearly didn't read the rules nor the FAQ, seemingly made no effort to do any research on their own first, and where the poster doesn't engage with the comments at all. I'm personally happy to help out new users, even if their questions kind of suck, if I can feel like I'm working *with* them to understand and solve their problem, not that they're just expecting to have me solve all their problems for them with no effort on their part.\n\nThis seems like the overall sentiment in this thread, too, although others are seemingly much more frustrated with that kind of behavior than I currently am.\n\nTo me, it seems to be a failure to \"remember the human,\" that is the askers of zero-effort questions fail to remember that anyone who answers them on here is a real person taking time out of their day to perform a volunteer service. The concomitant lack of effort on the askers' parts mean they will likely *not* read the rules, FAQ, or wiki, no matter how good those resources are, so I'm not convinced that any solutions revolving around those resources is going to be effective.\n\nOne possible solution could be to use an \"approved poster\" system, where you can get a flair by showing some minimum amount of effort \u2013 I'm thinking of a really low bar, like having a \"secret\" phrase in the rules that you can DM to the mod team to get flaired. Flared users would then be allowed to post freely, much as the sub is now. Posts from unflaired users would go into a review queue for mod approval before being posted.\n\nHopefully needing to invest a minimum of effort will lead to higher quality questions and more engagement from askers overall. And even those people who miss that step can still post, as long as they're willing to wait for a mod to look at their post and confirm it's not egregious. This potentially also sidesteps some of the issues that have been mentioned in this thread already, like the fact that even knowing where to start with the wiki might be challenging for a newcomer or non-native English speaker, since users falling into these categories but who are otherwise engaged and ready to learn would not be restricted from posting. Seeing that the asker has gone to the effort to get a flair may also encourage answerers to be less dismissive of low-knowledge (but not low-effort) posts, cutting down on the number of \"read the wiki\" comments. \n\nThe main potential drawback I can see is that this would create potentially a *lot* of new work for the mod team, and current moderator bandwidth may not be enough to handle it (depending on the flux of new users). I'm sure there are other drawbacks I've not thought of, too.",
            "Whenever these posts happen, you see people complain about how many poorly worded questions from newbies who clearly didn't read the wiki there are. \n\nI've been on this subreddit for around 7 years, it's always had a ton of posts like that. I remember people celebrating when the \"beginners install guide\" was removed from the wiki, as they blamed it for all the low quality posts. The posts never stopped, and despite all the complaints, archinstall didn't make it drastically worse.\n\nFurther, I don't understand what people want without those posts. Do they want more \"isn't Arch great,\" \"what WM is the best,\" or \"man systemd sucks\" circlejerks? Do they want more of the help requests where the problem isn't easily solved by the wiki, so gets nearly zero replies? People have some notion that without the low quality support posts this will be some drastically different community, and I just don't see that. \n\nIf anything \"recently\" has sparked an increase in help posts, it's the removal of the \"beginners questions megathread\" that was pinned but got removed when the Reddit mods drama happened. But please don't bring it back. Few people regularly checked it to provide help, meaning simple questions would go days being unanswered while someone else would make a new post with the same question and have it answered in minutes",
            "The Arch Subreddit is not Arch. I am a firm believer in the core Arch principles but I wish the reddit could be split into three sub-subreddits. Expert, Intermediate, Beginner.

            "I am happy with the current state of this subreddit. I find that by and large, posters do make helpful, relevant, respectful replies.",
            "I see that a good chunk of replies here are focused on the influx of new users and the inevitable decline in the community after it grows (without very aggressive moderation). I also agree with the concerns in those comments.\n\nI would like to throw my vote in suspending the \"be kind\" rule for posts which are zero effort, largely because kindness is subjective relative where it often gets mixed with bluntness.\n\nI don't feel the mods here are equipped to deal with this influx for multitude reasons, one of which is the reddit API shit storm from years ago removing mod tools, a lot of the original mods leaving (in terms of manpower, not quality), and these mods seemingly leaning towards a more polite approach which won't work with a massive influx of newbies. Therefore, I would suggest that mods let the community itself help contribute to the effort via aggressively slapping down such zero effort posts.\n\nAlso, making a rule where any questions that don't have a clear effort of exactly what attempts were taken originally all get deleted or locked, and multiple such posts from the same user get multi day banned, with a link to the Ubuntu or Linux subreddit.\n\nBasically, there needs to be a very aggressive push back against the low effort new commers, otherwise you will lose power users who respond to questions and correct mistakes. Or in shorter terms, please be very aggressive in moderation, as the community is rightfully so concerned about massive quality loss with the influx of new people.",
            "> We wish to be prepared for an influx of newer users in the wake of AI, privacy concerns, advancements in Linux gaming, and other things as they develop\n\nWell, I'm sad to see this .... along with the influx of first time Linux users and the degradation of this community as a whole. I had high hopes with the new mods, but have saw no improvement since Arch dev's u/Foxboron and u/Morganamilo bowed out of being mods here.\n\nMay as well delete Foxboron's stickied \"FAQ - Read before posting\" and replace it with the newly announced changes as well if it's officially no longer enforced.\n\nI've enjoyed most of my time here over the last 6 years and had some really interesting discussions and learned a lot in the beginning. Unfortunately with what has become of this community, I often find myself more annoyed than anything, hoping to find the illusive interesting post within the walls of zero effort cries for help. \n\nI'm afraid the time has come for me to bow out, and admit this is late in coming as well. I have nothing useful left except unpleasant replies to zero effort posts trying to right this ship to it's former glory by pointing out expectations and requirements to the undeserving recipients of my frustration.\n\nI sincerely hope Arch can continue to recruit enough qualified developers with \"the changing landscape of computing in 2024 and beyond\", to maintain itself as the quality Distro that has taught me so much over the last 15 years.\n\nBest of luck with the changes to everyone here, and I hope some of the knowledgeable members stick around to share their knowledge.\n\nLong Live Arch and Peace Out!",
            "Hi, are you guys the developers/maintainers/owners/contributors of Arch Linux? Or are you guys only maintaining this subreddit?",
            "Anecdotally speaking, lately there has been an influx of posts seeking help, without putting much, or any, effort into properly reading the Wiki and trying the advices there. There seems to be a general lack of research skills shown in those posts. This, after a while, gets rather infuriating for people who are tinkerers, problem-solvers and enthusiasts, who would normally help, but the lack of effort on OP-side, makes it worthless. There needs to be stricter enforecment of sub-rules.\n\nHaving used *nix systems since the early 90s, yes it can be indeed said that the landscape of computing has changed and is ever-changing. However, what is also changing is the sheer lack of learning in newer generation of users; I say this from my experience of teaching CS courses at tertiary level. They require more hand-holding and that's not what this sub or community stands for; at least that's how I view it. \n\nTo exacerbate this situation, there isn't much that one can do to \"quickly\" and \"politely\" acquaint such newcomers to the nature of Archlinux. If they aren't already reading the rules of the sub, or reading the wiki, which is linked from Arch's main website, or plainly asking \"where to download Arch?\", such users are akin to the phrase \"you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink\". There's more PEBCAK than DIY.\n\nFor new users, their posts should be put under moderation before publishing. Perhaps have mod-bot reply with links to wiki (RTFM).",
            "I think we can make a clear note of the DIY side of Arch somewhere that is visible for newcomers to the subreddit, perhaps in a revised FAQ. Maybe with a few recommended pages from Archwiki to lead the way.\n\nThis post hopes for any community feedback. Let's see if we can improve things.\n\nWe do have users at various levels of understanding of a Linux system. I personally came to Arch as my very first Linux distro, with zero experience in the terminal beforehand. I was able to learn things quite easily.\n\nAs a separate community from official Arch Linux forums, we (mods) currently think that we should be *welcoming and supportive* to newcomers to Arch. But we are aware of the recent change in content. Some posts lack any effort before posting, which we try to filter out. On the other hand some of the rather simple questions seem proper, and pointers from our more experienced users are helpful.",
            "In the end, arch is a DIY distro. The wiki is a fantastic resource and has everything you need if you're willing to put in the effort. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing to keep that as the barrier for entry. \n\nIf the installer does what you need it for, then great, but there is a general expectation that you are using this distro because you want to take an interest in your system. That means reading documentation, learning how things work under the hood at least enough to get by, and taking an active role in solving your problems/implementing what you need. \n\nArch was my first linux journey, but I also did my research and knew what I was getting into. I like the fact that we are a community of enthusiasts. It's better to cater to the extant community than try and change our community for a hypothesized newcomer.",

But some short and simple posts are actually proper too. Similarly for some posts coming from new or low-karma accounts. Perhaps we can go more on the removal side, with more manual approval.\n\nYour suggestions are noted.\n\n**Edit:** Posts with 5 reports were auto-removed, we reduced it to 3 reports.",
            "Woah, easy there!\n\nWe haven't decided on any changes or actions yet. The whole point of this post is so that us mods aren't taking free liberty to change the subreddit in opposition to what the community wants, or in opposition to what is healthy for the subreddit. \n\nSo let's start with this: When you think back to a time in this subreddit's history that you would consider glorious, what specific things did you see that gave you that impression?\n\nCould those things maybe be encouraged with a certain post flair, or updating the screenshot policy, or opening up a chat channel? If you felt like an influx of new people were on the way, what would Cody\\_Learner do to prepare for it? \n\n(and to quickly answer u/FungalSphere... could be people new to Linux in general, but I do mean really anyone who finds their way to our subreddit, no matter their previous experience... Chances are, people who decide to try Linux will most likely follow common advice and try Mint or Pop OS first)\n\nOk, I don't know if the chat channel thing is still an option or not... I can look into it if it even remotely seems like a decent idea... but the point is, this is a good opportunity to say what you really want to see, doesn't it seem a bit premature to bow out just yet?

            "You've just summed up what I've felt abt this sub for a while unfortunately :(",
            "Always good to help new users. The main thing are just the expectations are off for some of them. For example, Arch's principal on staying true to upstream with only absolutely necessary downstream modifications. If a user installs a display manager, it's not going to enable its service in Systemd. Installing a Wayland or Wayland/X(DRI) compositor will not ensure that their Nvidia GPU has the proper KMS mode setting enabled at boot. Downstream configs as another example. Some just expect everything to work like it likely would on say, Ubuntu. \n\nI think that would be good to add such a note. But when someone doesn't read said note, then the reply may be a bit terse. Then its: \"OMG GATEKEEPING!\" So, there's really no win to the scenario. It's kind of sad to see the great resource that is the Arch Wiki not being used by someone when it outlines all the said steps and pitfalls. Some new users are awesome and outline their steps and provide more details of their setup. \n\nBut then there are posts like this one: *\"everytime i install arch linux its all fine and working but when i reboot its black screen with cursor and the \"|\" text thingy top left screen how do i fix this?\"* And I can understand that getting the \"RTFM\" treatment from someone. I personally just don't even bother to reply. When it comes to RTFM, i link to the AW article. Of course, for that one, I wouldn't even know where to begin. It would probably be better if I just informed them about what Arch is, its principle on DIY, what other distros do better and why they may be a better fit. \n\nOf course that would probably just come off as rude by many new users. This reply isn't so much a suggestion to mods, but a suggestion for how I could do things different and what /r/archlinux is looking for when it comes to new users. A lot of that you already answered. Thank you.\n\n*Edit: Yes. \"Be Kind\" is something the internet needs more of in general.",
            "This is duly noted, thank you for sharing. I like your choice of words there with \"community of enthusiasts\"\n\nSo I guess to that end, would you have any thoughts about these?:\n\nWhat ways can you think of that would most quickly, clearly, (and politely) acquaint a newcomer with the expectation that a DIY attitude and a certain level of enthusiasm are a part of the Arch lifestyle?\n\nWhat ways can we as an established community maybe turn newcomers into mature enthusiasts and contributors?\n\nAre the above even acceptable ideas in your opinion?",

I saw a discussion here the other day essentially complaining about the fact that questions are often answered with a link to the wiki.

I know I've had trouble even figuring out where to start in the past, so learning more about how to diagnose, communicate, and investigate problems could be beneficial. The more a new user can learn about how to ask questions and the process of troubleshooting the better."

        "content": "Edit: Noticed this might have come off a little edgy. I am trying to say that Linux is built ground up for real time and mission critical applications like real time audio processing and machine learning. Windows doesn\u2019t hold a candle in this regard and I\u2019m trying to wrap my head around how much farther along the Linux desktop would be if good software developers (even enterprise/commercial ones) adopted Linux as opposed to Windows. Sorry for the confusion. I still do think there is some headassery (discord mod calls girls kitten energy) but I should have been more clear and the Arch community deserves better. A better title would have been \u201cLinux is the most powerful platform to develop on, Why aren\u2019t more commercial/enterprise software developers on board?\u201d\n\nHey homies, I use arch btw. \n\nNow that I got the secret password out of the way, we need to have an open discussion about what I believe is the biggest factor that is keeping the Linux Desktop from being widely adopted.\n\nI\u2019ll start with a little anecdote about the software that is keeping me from reaching my full potential, FL Studio. I have for about a decade have been trying to get FL Studio to work on Linux (with real-time capabilities). \n\nI am not an edgy teenager trying to make Windows/Mac software work on Linux for bragging rights. I am a musician who has worked at dozens of live music venues in NYC. \n\nFrom live sound, lights + laser shows, to featuring and producing big name artists at Studios\u2026\n\nI does this. Using FL Studio, I have programmed lights and lasers, video fx, and ran sound for acts that have performed at the Super Bowl. Apart from the creativity and know how, FL Studio stayed out of my way and allowed me to utilize it as the perfect toolbox in my Pro Audio career.  \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, there are tons of evil software companies *cough* Adobe. But there are plenty of companies that are made by professionals for professionals. Image Line is one of those companies. I have brought three licenses from them over the span of 15 years. All of them are still in use, get me the latest version of the software, and nothing in their action makes me believe that they will renege on their Lifetime Updates policy.\n\nNow, the important part. Why do I care if \u201cXYZ Commercial Software is on Linux and why does the Arch community have to care?\u201d\n\nFOSS is the back bone of technology. Pipewire is an audio-server that handles real-time audio handling and routing of both digital and hardware I/O. If I want my YouTube video routed to my DAW, processed, and routed back out to my OBS stream, ASIO and CoreAudio are unable to do this real time without janky workarounds or hardware loopback capabilities. On Linux, every hardware and Digital \nI/O can be routed real-time. Before some fanboy comes and says \u201cWindows/MacOS can do that, you\u2019re just stupid\u201d, just know Pipewire and it\u2019s predecessor Jack could route real-time audio as many times per program/hardware I/O as your CPU would allow, would allow it regardless of DRM protection, and would do it free of charge.  And keep in mind, even on native Windows, FL Studio cannot achieve this level of kernel/OS level routing (nor can any other Windows DAW for that matter). \n\nAre Microsoft/Apple incapable of releasing a Kernel/OS level audio server that can route any audio both physical and digital to any other physical or digital I/O? Nope, there is definitely a monetary reason for crippling OS capabilities. Even if they didn\u2019t want to spend the money developing the software, they could add FOSS code to their OS allowing this. Pipewire is FOSS with absolutely no limitations. \n\nBefore anyone recommends a workaround or solution, just know that I have compiled more custom kernels and tested more versions of Wine than I care to remember. Real Time Audio for non native Linux apps is not a thing. Maybe some smaller VST programs but not full DAWs like Fl Ableton etc. \n\nArch is the community that I feel is the most pragmatic about FOSS and Linux. For 90% of the world, the Linux desktop has been ready for a decade now. For the niche professionals and gamers, we have more work to do before the Linux desktop is prime time. \n\nI know many of us are serious about FOSS and Linux for the sake of privacy and freedom in the age of information but we have to embrace commercial software developers as imperfect allies / necessary evil at worst or the chance to contribute to a better technological future at best. \n\nLet me know your thoughts or ways to better petition Software Publishers to release Linux Native versions of their commercial software. \n\nEdit: Forgive the grammar, my phone was laggy typing this. \n\n\n",

Everything that connects to JACK can now connect to FL Studio.\n\nEnterprise software coming to Linux will happen naturally when there's a market. Companies that make enterprise software don't hate Linux, Image-Line devs specifically even have fixed a few issues that only happen under wine, despite it being an unsupported configuration! The only reason why there isn't a Linux-native version is because it costs dev time and almost nobody wants it (comparatively speaking).\n\nEnterprise software coming to Linux isn't the gateway to desktop Linux, it's the other way around. Once using a Linux-based OS on their desktop becomes appealing to consumers (the average person!) - enterprises will follow naturally.",
            "This stuff absolutely DOES NOT exist in Windows: is absolutely unsuitable for low latency processing. I have done many experiments in this area. It distorts catastrophically at low buffer sizes even when the processing hardware is at 30% capacity. Hardware interrupts cannot be avoided or reprioritized and that's a big issue. DPC latency is basically a black box that says \"fuck you\" to some hardware combos. Only Linux allows you to patch in a real time kernel and that's why things like the Waves Server and the Midas HD96 run on Linux, while DiGiCo and Avid do processing in FPGAs and only handles control data thru a Windows 7 interface..\n\nFL is a superb DAW btw, as a recorder/mixer/masterer I'm a Reaper man myself but if I was any kind of beatmaker that's what I'd use.",

            "Outjerked",
            "First, archlinux has nothing to do with any of this by essence. They provide a blending edge distro with almost always an untouched and quickly tested version of a big amount of foss software and allow community to easily \"package\" the other apps (foss or not) with an unverified and unsecure AUR system. All of this is made by a limited amount of people, with a limited time, and no cash. I hope no serious company will use archlinux to make or distribute its software on it, that would be dumb.\n\nThat said, I also hope that more software at least come to Linux, and the situation evolve, slowly, as Linux (for desktop) become more and more equiped with professional tools (drivers, audio/video stacks, security,...). For pro audio producing now we have a great stack, for video producing we almost have it (we miss some things in the wayland protocols, but some are working hard to get it done), for 3d creation Blender is a great Linux professional app, and gaming is pushed by Valve and some foss makers to see enough games working to swich to Linux.\n\nBut we can't blame companies with limited resources to come to Linux because it has a development cost and a small user market. And big companies... don't wait for them, they'll come when they can't have the choice anymore.\n\nWhat you can do to help is to support companies coming to Linux (in your usage for music producing, daws and vsts), and motivate \"coworkers\" (other professionals) to test easy distributions like Ubuntu or maybe Fedora.\n\nAs for you specific example (I see you try to have a global discussion, but your frustration come mainly from FL Studio and music production), I have some things to say, being also (at a small level) a music producer :\n\n- pipewire is a great pro-audio stack, but it is still young and not completly stable. But it has enough capability to be the most complete stack, above Coreaudio (we are digging to find the Windows one...). Jack is older and stable, but harder to use (unless you use it since years and learned all its subtilities).\n\n- Coreaudio has multiple ways to get things done with audio routing, you can agregate inputs and outputs on a virtual device, and send virtual/physical devices to multiple outputs without lag or heavy processing, and that is native features (I've done this weeks ago, it works very well). One thing is made by third party software (BlackHole for my usage, free and opensource), routing system output to an input, to get the system output shown as an input into a daw. But Coreaudio is very capable and mature.\n\n- nothing to say about Windows stack, nothing pro by default and Asio isn't perfect, nor integrated.\n\n- as said by someone else, FL studio works on Linux with a wine+jack backend, this is a first step, other uncompatible daws don't have it, if you use FL, use it on Linux and tell devs this is your main system. You can also change to a Linux compatible daw (foss or not, Ardour, Zrythm, Bitwig, Reaper), but I don't think they will have all the capabilities you need.\n\n- I am on MacOS for music producing instead of Linux because I use archlinux for everything else since +10 years and I have too much instabilities to get it working everytime I want to (updates sometimes changes the behavior and I can't wait for a fix or take time to find the issue when I need to create). I don't use another more stable Linux like Ubuntu because I have only another powerful host being a macmini, and don't want to dualboot anymore.\n\n- I try to push Linux in a way, because after starting with Reason on Windows years ago (and cry with Asio), I changed to Bitwig who support Linux to trash my Windows installation. Paying for Bitwig is a way to show that this is a good thing to be open to Linux (and oh boy, this daw is so good... another topic). I launch it to Linux to test and master my songs sometimes when I can, to let them see I use Linux. I also buy mainly (a few) vsts available on Linux and try to send messages to other companies to ask them to add a Linux compability.\n\nI hope to see more professional software and more motivated companies on Linux but I already see a lot of good things happening in this way.",

(Not inappropriately). \n\nLinux had the capability for real time applications since its inception. \n\nAudio Processing is much like machine learning. \n\nAlgorithmic functions processing in real time until told to stop. A compressor lowers the volume of sound above a certain threshold by a certain ratio. Anything below it is unaffected. A very primitive way to do this is just lowering the volume when something is loud and raising it when it is low. \n\nCompression requires 10x more DSP power than raising or lowering volume (which technically isn\u2019t DSP but you get the point). There are much more complex functions that require exponentially more DSP than the previous comparison. Windows is not suitable for it at all. Hardware has just gotten good enough to brute force it. Imagine a whole array of DSP running in real time, Windows is just not good enough for that. \n\nLinux was ground up developed for it.  My original point was that if the Enterprise Software that are not Linux native were built on Linux (whether foss or not) we\u2019d be much farther ahead in so many aspects of computing and professional Linux software. \n\nDef didn\u2019t explain myself the best initially but hopefully that makes sense.\n\nEdit: And for me FL Studio just has integration with lighting and motion fx. Whenever I used to do weddings, I could quickly map the drummers kick, my guitar, etc to the lights with some quick patcher surgery. Not saying reaper can\u2019t do this but I know you\u2019ve seen the speed runs lol.\n\nif I had to do a whole show with lights and such live with no prep time and completely blind, I pick FL every time.

When that's finished my plan was to use Gentoo/Portage to craft the perfect kernel & support system and then Nix to deploy it. But people are going to want this shit to run in Ubuntu.\n\nAs an aside, let's talk again about how nothing works in Windows. Let's talk about RAINMETER. What a piece of trash that program is forced to be by Microsoft's greedy kernel, and how many newbie's problems I have solved by recommending uninstalling it.\n\nOr we could talk about how Microsoft never wrote a generic audio driver better (or even viable) than FOSS ASIO.\n\nBut I'd always rather talk about Reaper! Having that Linux native version is a true blessing. Unfortunately I've had a lot of issues getting plugin GUIs intended for Windows working in either bridged native or wreaper, which is my incredibly hilarious alias for reaper in wine. With my bigass collection it was too difficult to port, so I still have a W10 install, because you don't actually need low latency processing in mixing and mastering.\n\nUuuh, where was I going with this, anyway? I use Reaper cause it offers zero friction towards doing exactly those three things I mentioned earlier. Even editing is something some people have told me it just isn't doing well enough to switch out of, but to be honest I just don't do enough editing to see any deficiencies in Reaper in this department. Same with the piano roll. But I highly suspect these people have simply not bothered to figure out how it works or adjust it to their preferences. I don't know a thing about triggering lights with Reaper. I figure you could maybe do it with midi.  I have edited a little video in Reaper. It's nothing like a video editor but it's actually not too bad once you figure out the video processor plugin.\n\nI don't say it to their faces, but I secretly lose respect for everyone who hasn't ditched Pro Tools yet. It shows a lack of discrimination/judgement, an unwillingness to grow, an adherence to dogmatism, and worst of all, that they don't care about the quality of the tools they use. Most live sound guys are 110% distrustworthy of it and have been for a long time, you see a lot of Reaper, Nuendo, discontinued and unsupported Waves Trax Live nonsense, just literally anything that connects to the audio device on the first try and runs thru the whole show without crashing.\n\nI am just a self taught hobbyist developer but it constantly amazes me that any professional organization chooses Windows as a host platform. The only explanation of course is the ubiquity of the userbase, which must be catered to by means of the lowest common denominator, thereby inevitably alienating the power user.",
            "If OP had this kind of thinking, I would answer that not everyone using archlinux is experimented enough to help (see the newcomers of this sub), and there's also a lot of experimented users on other distributions. Also, the target of those companies would be Ubuntu users, because when you want something professional, and aren't a technical experimented linux user but only a user like many, you want something basic working out of the box. So I don't think archlinux users would be a better help than any other user community, and I think archlinux is definitively not the target, either for asking help or tests, nor to publish beta versions. The tests will be done on archlinux by some users, but this will be done only when the company has added Linux compatibility. Finally, Ubuntu (and some other distributions) never had any issue with proprietary softwares too.\n\nThat said, I understand that you are trying to extrapolate OP thinking and I'm only answering to this hypothetical state :-) (sorry for my english, not my main language, and short night)",

The examples you gave with video editing and 3D creation are valid examples of professional tools that don't require to go all the way down to the hardware, making it harder to prove the point about Linux being a viable user base to expand to for the pro tools market.

Or at least so it seems... There is a possibility that arch, with the user centrality principle, DIY oriented technical users and the objectively better performance could offer a user base worth porting professional programs for, but what can the arch community do to make companies understand it? This is what OP is asking, why this is a thing to discuss community-wide and why this is not about bending arch around companies, but rather make companies see arch as a platform worth investing for.\n\nSaying \"ask ubuntu\" is particularly wrong because the kind of professional tool OP wishes would be ported is far more suited for the technical Arch user rather than the target Ubuntu user.",

FL Studio isn\u2019t one of the most popular DAWs for no reason. The sauce is obviously in the DSP and how well it integrates. \n\nAlso by your standard If it isn\u2019t enterprise, Why does it integrate directly with other Enterprise software/hardware solutions like DMX Universes, Video Production, A/V, etc by default?",
            "in your line of work enterprise must mean something different but the widely accepted term is representing software inside a fortune 500 company. this is how most people use the term and will see it this way. you using the word headass prives that none if this diftware is ebterprise because people in suits arebt running arpund saying headass. that sounds like some millenialz garbage.",
            "lol don\u2019t sit here and let me look stupid.\n\nYou tell me, have you ever heard someone refer to professional industry standard software as \u201centerprise\u201d? Is AutoDesk Maya enterprise? Etc etc. Even if you\u2019re right and it\u2019s only for coke sniffing finance bros as you describe, you\u2019re telling me you weren\u2019t smart enough to make that association in your head and move on? There are plenty of words for people like that, H E A D A S S is just kind of funny. But I def called you a few of them in my head lol but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the first."
