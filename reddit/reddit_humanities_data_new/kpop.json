It was really hard to number rank since I usually rank songs in tiers but I always tune into IVE whenever new music drops!",

        "content": "[Welcome](https://i.imgur.com/YiGK5g2.png) to this special r/kpop Town Hall, Post Flairs edition! The Town Hall is an opportunity for the mods to make announcements and propose changes, while also getting feedback from the community!\n\n***\n\n## Agenda\n\n1. Filter by Flair\n2. Pictorial Flair Introduction\n3. Magazine Pictorial Rules Redux\n4. \u2018Am I using the right Flair?\u2019\n5. r/kpophelp & r/kpoppers Flairs: Connect, Research, Advice, Merch\n\n\nIn March 2023 we held a Town Hall for various things with plans to have a series of Town Halls over the following few months\u2026 which promptly did not happen at all. We\u2019ll take a big ol\u2019 **L** on that. Our burnout lingers. And this year, there has been a nearly constant stream of more important things to handle before any Meta issues. But we\u2019ve been sitting on drafts for infrastructural things we need to get to, even if we just get to them one category at a time. So as we hit 3 million subscribers, we\u2019ll try to make some improvements by covering everything about **POST FLAIRS** in this focused Town Hall.\n\n***\n\n## Filter by Flair\n\nLast Autumn, the Reddit Admins were working on introducing a new interface to filter by Post Flair on Reddit\u2019s official Mobile App. You can now see this displayed near the top of r/kpop as a sideways scrolling carousel with all the Post Flairs we use in the subreddit. It works great now. But early on it seemed like it created a conflict with how flair filtering worked when on New Reddit in a browser. Users on New Reddit would go to tap on a Flair Filter in the sidebar and get no results. We corroborated this happening with other moderators around Reddit. What we all had in common is we used non-alphanumeric characters in our Post Flairs, like the brackets we use here (eg. [MV], [Teaser]). It took some months, but eventually the Admins fixed this problem.\n\n**If you are still seeing any problems with Filtering by Flair in New Reddit, or anywhere else, please let us know so we can take a look at it.**\n\nWe\u2019ll note that on Old Reddit, the buttons in the sidebar to Filter by Flair categories are not well-updated and have a tendency to break whenever we try to update them. That\u2019s something for us to work on in the future.\n\n***\n\n## Pictorial Flair Introduction\n\nWe\u2019re introducing a new flair! See the next section for more info about rules for the content this flair will cover, but simply the new flair is\u2026\n\n**[Pictorial]**\n\nThis flair is for Magazine Cover / Pictorial content only. We have been using the [Teaser] flair for this content previously. We will now separate these out. This new flair is in our overall \u2018Variety\u2019 category, which is pink in color, alongside [Behind-the-Scenes], [VLOG], [CF], etc. Please use the new [Pictorial] flair for Magazine Image content from now on!\n\n\n***\n\n## Magazine Pictorial Rules Redux\n\nBack in the [July 2021 Town Hall](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/oo0kl7/state_of_the_subreddit_rkpop_town_hall_july_2021/) we allowed posts for both the Announcement/Cover on its own and the Featured Content/Interview on its own instead of only allowing the written Interview content.\n\nPart of those rules read as the following:\n\n* Images (Photoshoot/Pictorial) within a Magazine feature should ONLY be included in the comments of the Magazine Feature/Content post.\n\nWithin a couple months, this little rule was broken as users simply included the Photoshoot/Pictorial content along with the Cover image as a full gallery. We let this happen since it had also been our intention to see how things went over time.\n\nEven as users mildly broke this little rule, they did so diligently, with carefully crafted titles and neatly compiled galleries, while still correctly posting the interviews and other video content as well. These posts have also been fairly popular, gaining some significant engagement and positive discussion.\n\nSo, we\u2019re honoring user consistency to adjust our rules to match what you\u2019ve been doing.\n\n### Pictorial TL;DR\n\n* Keep doing what you\u2019ve already been doing with Magazine Cover/Pictorial content.\n* Use the new [Pictorial] flair instead of [Teaser].\n* Don\u2019t use the words \u2018teaser\u2019 or \u2018preview\u2019 in the title unless it really makes sense to.\n\n\n*More detail\u2026*\n\n\n**Updated Rules for Magazine Feature/Content:**\n\n* **Magazine Interview/Article:** Link to the source of the interview, article, or significant written content. If the written content is not in English, provide a translation in comments OR make the post submission a direct link to an article that is fully translated and sourced (eg. Soompi). Use the [Interview] flair. \n\n* **Magazine Cover/Feature Announcement only:** Submit the link to the official announcement as the main post. Use the [News] flair.\n\n* **Magazine Pictorial Content (NEW!):** Submit the Cover image and/or a set of images from a magazine feature pictorial/photoshoot. Use the [Pictorial] flair.\n\n**IMPORTANT !**: This Pictorial category is for Magazine Content only. We still have a rule against standalone CF/Advertisement images being posted. We recognize this could cause some confusion considering many magazine shoots include an endorsement with fashion brands, products, etc. We are ALLOWING these images purely in the context of Magazine Content. DO NOT post CF/Advertisement images that are not published in a magazine. Digital magazines are acceptable.\n\nFor titles, not much will change from what you\u2019ve already been doing. There is just no need to include \u2018Teaser\u2019 anywhere and we encourage you not to. Using something like \u2018Preview\u2019 might be relevant in some cases, but it\u2019s not necessary and will remain up to your discretion.\n\n**Title Formatting:** `Artist Name - Magazine Name (Month YYYY or Issue # Cover / Pictorial)`\n\nAcceptable examples:\n\n* aespa - PAPER Magazine (March 2023 Cover)\n* BTS SUGA - Marie Claire Korea x Valentino (May 2023 Issue Cover 2)\n* Mark (NCT) - W Korea Magazine (Vol. 5 May 2023 Issue Cover)\n* GOT7 BamBam - @star1 Magazine (April 2023 Issue Cover + Pictorial)\n* Taeyeon (Girls' Generation) - ELLE Taiwan (April 2023 Covers)\n* Taecyeon (2PM) - GQ Taiwan Magazine (March & April 2023 Issue Cover / Pictorial)\n* MONSTA X Hyungwon - Y Magazine (Issue #9 Cover + Pictorial)\n\n*NOTE the flexibility with artist names and with how different magazines identify specific editions.*\n\n\n***\n\n## \u2018Am I using the right Flair?\u2019\n\nWe\u2019ve noticed some confusion with flairs being used for similar kinds of content. Let\u2019s try to make these distinctions a little clearer.\n\n\n**[Live]:** Use [Live] for performances with an audience present. The performer is singing and/or dancing on stage for an audience. Music Show performances, concerts, festivals, busking, etc.\n\n**[Performance]:** No audience. Usually this will be a pre-recorded production with editing done after the recording. It is more likely to be dance-focused, but not always. These productions will usually be done by a different company or production studio from the performer\u2019s own company. Studio Choom, Dingo Killing Voice, 1theK special clips, M2 Relay dances, etc.\n\n**[Dance Practice]:** This will typically be in a literal dance studio with the performers going through the choreography with minimal editing and usually with little to no special styling/costumes.\n\n**[MV]:** The official MV is obvious, but you should also use [MV] for the alternative MVs released officially by the artist/company themselves. These will usually have been filmed/created at the same time as the main MV, but will be just the \u2018Performance/Choreography ver.\u2019 or something like the \u2018Self Cam ver.\u2019 or in an alternate language. B-sides could also be in this category if they have a well-produced, edited, choreography-focused video, with full styling/costumes. It\u2019s preferred to use [MV] for all of these instead of [Performance].\n\n**[Song/Dance Cover]:** These \u2018Cover\u2019 flairs are performances that *could* use the [Live] or [Performance] flairs except that it is a cover of a song or dance by a different artist. The [Song/Dance Cover] flair is prioritized above all other flairs except for [Dance Challenge] posts.\n\n**[CF] vs. [News]:** A [CF] post will be a video advertisement only. An announcement about an upcoming CF collab or endorsement will use a [News] flair.\n\n\nLet us know if you have questions about any specific flair use-cases or are still confused about anything here! We will try to compile these and make a quick reference on the rules page if it's helpful.\n\n\n***\n\n## r/kpophelp & r/kpoppers Flairs\n\nWe have a few more flairs to introduce, but they are for our sister subreddits r/kpophelp and r/kpoppers.\n\n**r/kpophelp**\n\n* **Advice** - This flair is replacing \u2018Discussion\u2019. We want to emphasize that r/kpophelp is not a general discussion subreddit. \u2018Advice\u2019 will be for users seeking advice for things like auditioning, concert preparation, those struggling with parasocial issues, etc.\n\n* **Merch** - Any questions related to the logistics of buying K-Pop products and merchandise should use this flair. Where to buy, shipping issues, legitimacy/reliability of vendors and similar topics can use this flair. Remember that buying/selling products is not allowed here and that merch authentication should be done in the Monthly post pinned at the top of the subreddit.\n\n* **Research** - Academic surveys related to K-Pop or fandom topics.\n\n**r/kpoppers**\n\n* **Connect** - This flair will be used for anything where fans are trying to socially connect with each other. Announcing new K-Pop subreddits or Discords, looking for mutual fans on social media, wanting to meet up at a concert, seeking fans in a region to form a dance group, networking for a fan project, announcing a K-Pop night at a club, etc.\n\n* **Research** - Same as r/kpophelp. Academic surveys related to K-Pop or fandom topics.\n\n\n**We are also fully banning K-Pop related surveys in r/kpop** as we introduce these \u2018Research\u2019 flairs in our other subreddits. Surveys posted here have been increasingly unpopular and get heavily downvoted or reported in this main subreddit for years, so we\u2019ll make it official that these surveys are welcome in r/kpophelp and r/kpoppers only.\n\n\n***\n\nFeedback is welcome for anything related to Post Flairs. We know folks will probably have other Town Hall related topics they\u2019d like to discuss. We\u2019ll ask that you only mention them briefly or [send us a Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/kpop&subject=Town%20Hall%20Topic) about those issues instead. Then we can try to integrate those issues into a later Town Hall where they will be more relevant.",

I'd prefer not to see any ads or news about ads (which one could argue are ads about ads), so being able to do `-flair:cf` to filter out anything ad-related would be great.",
            "We could use [Cheering Guide] and [Reaction] flairs because cheering guides, MV reactions, and performance video reactions are extremely common these days yet are relegated to the [Misc] flair since we have nowhere else to put them. Just a suggestion.",

            "I'm excited for it as a fan of theirs in the past, but I kind of feel like this article oversells the significance of their return before we've seen what the actual impact is? Like it's huge for fans, but it's essentially a group that disbanded because of a shitty company and then ... reforming. That will be unusual if they continue promoting as a group and nothing else, for sure, but it's not like other old groups that disbanded or stopped promoting to do solo work don't get get back together periodically to release new albums.",
            "B.A.P alone changed the genre. The fact that a group like them are the time was capable of generating that much excitement rocked the scene. If you were there, we all remember when them and expo were battling it out on the award scene. But with TS\u2019s poor treatment, they did what was necessary. Seeing them come back together (I believe because of Jongup) is going to alter the landscape again. Their sound really did inspire the likes of Stray Kids and Ateez",
            "I've never been much of a fan but as someone who saw their debut and how their career unfolded, I'm just glad to see that they're doing this together on their own terms.",
            "is this their last cb ?",
            "As a late comer to K-pop and having gone back to listening to gen 3 music, how did BTS become more popular than B.A.P. and Block B?",
            "good music, lots of fan interaction, great fan service, great group dynamics that made people love them, lots of talent in making music, music that touches on hard topics and touches hearts deeply, etc. \n\nBAP also stopped activities and sued their company at one point which killed their momentum, BB had some controversies and their image was more niche and less liked by the general public",
            "I think BTS having an ambitious multimedia project like HYYH (The Most Beautiful Moment in Life) really helped them. All these groups debuted at a time when K-pop MVs didn\u2019t always have English subtitles and albums weren\u2019t readily available in Target. So if you\u2019re an overseas fan, the easiest media to obtain was music on a streaming service and MVs on YouTube. I can see something like HYYH, which had lore told through music and MVs (with other supplementary material like books and websites), catching the attention of overseas fans and making them want to check out other parts of the \u201cstory\u201d and so they\u2019d put in the extra effort to track down and translate BTS\u2019 other material and appearances. People love expanded universes.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m giving too much credit to the international fans but IMO that\u2019s what really put BTS over the top because their international success bolstered them domestically. While popular, they weren\u2019t the top boy group in Korea at the time and I don\u2019t think they would\u2019ve become so dominant if K-pop had remained more localized.",
            "Idk about Block B but with BAP having the lawsuit with TS Entertainment it slowed down a lot of momentum and no one trusted TS. Towards the end in 2018 Himchan got indicted for SA, which I believe probably affected their decision to disband. Also, I remember Yongguk was having mental health issues and had to take hiatus at one point. Since TS Entertainment officially shut down in 2021 they (minus Himchan) were probably able to get the rights to the BAP name easier, so they're coming back! I remember both EXO and BAP's debuts and they were rival monster rookies. I also remember BTS' debut and they were good but it's crazy to see where they are now.\n\nEdit: Also, in my opinion TS was salty about the lawsuit and after that they did not give them adequate promotions. 'MATRIX' was good but from 'Carnival' onwards the promotion was severely lacking.",
            "No lawsuits that interrupted their growth.\n\nIt's true that all three were gaining somehow equal popularity at some point but both B.A.P and BB got caught up in legal proceedings with their companies and lost the momentum so we will never know who would have emerged on top if all three had the same supportive environment as BTS."

With her warm heart and loving personality, she always stays by her friend's side no matter what they do.\n\n[Translation 1](https://x.com/2Moori/status/1804366641482076258) / [Translation 2](https://x.com/2Moori/status/1804380025837490583) / [Translation 3](https://x.com/2Moori/status/1804396186297864237) / [Translation 4](https://x.com/2Moori/status/1804409975210676623) / [Translation 5](https://x.com/2Moori/status/1804425237817364641) / [Translation 6](https://x.com/2Moori/status/1804440071258738843) / [Translation 7](https://x.com/2Moori/status/1804455112875692132)",

            "now that you compiled all into a single description. am i trippin myself to see its actually a single person rather than 7 different people?",
            "Hmm, I can see what you mean, but at the same time, some of the descriptions kind of contradict each other (like the first one saying she has a cold and emotionless exterior vs the final one describing her as someone with a lovely glow, which sounds to me like she appears \u201ccute\u201d/\u201ccheerful\u201d, but I could be wrong).\n\nIf it\u2019s just one person, then I assume it might be the person running the account 9mynameis1, since one of the stations where the teasers were airdropped was Gu-il (9-1). They were also the one who gave Somnias [the suitcase with the police report about the missing person at the end of OOTD](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamcatcher/s/bSUvkAftyp) months ago, and they said that their friend had gone missing and they were trying to find her."
