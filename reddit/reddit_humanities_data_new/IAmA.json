            "Hello, and thank you for doing this AMA.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1) In the southeastern region of the US that you study, are there any estimates or predictions that have a consensus in the scientific community about how much more frequent wildfires will become in the coming decades?\n\n2) Given that you have associations with and advise graduate students at Florida-based institutions, will [the recent change in Florida state law that effectively scrubs mentions of \"climate change\"](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/16/1251769080/florida-desantis-climate-change-law) from the state code at all impact your or their work?",
            "Hi Dr. Robertson, thanks for doing this AMA.  I'm curious what you might suggest as long-term solutions / remediations for fire danger.  I live in the PNW and the last decade or so at the end of the summer we have \"smoke season\" from wildfires in the West and Canada.\n\nWe obviously need forests for the long term health of our planet, but is there anything we (or specifically timber companies) can do differently to manage AND protect them?",
            "As a Virginian, I was quite surprised by the outbreak of wildfires here and in eastern West Virginia back in March - especially given that it seemed like we got a decent amount of precipitation plus the ever-present humidity.\n\nWas this a sign of things to come or a fairly unique set of conditions?",
            "What is your opinion of Chad Hanson?",
            "What research or technology from the past two decades has most changed the way we manage wildfire?",
            "Is it true there is a job titled \u201cBurn Boss\u201d?",

            "Is it windier on average this year compared to other years or decades?",
            "Oooh i might have missed this but wanted to ask if the SE USA with its remarkably different and humid climate (plus swamps) has similar mechanisms to how fire affects coniferous forests in the Pacific Northwest, namely that there are certain plants that germinate DUE to having been exposed to a forest fire, meaning that fire is part of a cycle in the biome?",
            "You make an argument for promoting native biodiversity in here. I think that's a good idea so please don't take this as an attack, but in Oregon we're seeing, especially in the south of the state, that we don't have the same weather conditions that led to the growth of our forests in the first place. We're getting dryer and hotter. It doesn't seem possible to recreate that native biodiversity. Should we adopt a policy of trying to recreate central California's native biodiversity? \n\nAlso, I've been reading about the history of the state and was kind of shocked to find in the northern part of the state, the native biodiversity pre 1830s was more more hardwood forests as opposed to the kinds of forest we have now. Apparently the majority of the state's forests are secondary growth. How can we figure out what native biodiversity actually is if we're about 7 to 8ish generations into a pretty new ecology?",
            "When are we getting AI powered firefighting drone swarms?",
            "Hi Kevin,\n\nWhat's your take on the need to diversify the forestry sector in Florida from mostly commercial pine species to long-leaf pine and hardwoods? My understanding is that the pine market has softened while the hardwood market has made it more competitive, and deciduous trees tend to provide some natural resistance to burning, either in mixed forests or hardwood dominant forests.",
            "I heard recently that scientists are advocating when there is a forest fire to just\"let it burn\". Their reasoning was something around that the forest will actually become more resilient when it regrows. \n\nDo you think that's true? How do you feel about such statements?",

Thank you so much!",
            "Can't we just create artificial rain in places with rampant forest fires?",
            "A simple but serious question: why is every board and staff member of your organization, as well as all your visitors (from photos on your web site) white?  Your history says that your property was originally a slave-holding estate, but it is now 2024. The area where you are located is actually minority white. How do you account for this, and why should anyone want to work with you? How do you justify working for an apparently racist institution?",
            "1. I think there is a consensus that weather events will become more extreme, both tropical storms (which bring precipitation that fuels growth of plants and thus fuel for fire) and droughts. The frequency of wildfires, that is, how many individual fires occur, is probably not as big of a concern as how widespread and difficult to control each wildfire is. Given stronger droughts, I am afraid we will see more of what we saw in southeastern Louisiana last year, which was uncontrollable wildfires in long-fire-excluded pine plantations that in the past were not very prone to wildfires. Almost any vegetation type will burn if it is dry enough. Of course prescribed fire (controlled fires applied in careful settings)\u00a0 is a very effective way of reducing fuel loads and mitigating the effects of wildfires and making them easier to contain.\n\n2. I am not sure who exactly that law applies to, but I am assuming that it is employees of state agencies and not college professors. Assuming that is true, I do not see it directly impacting our research. I am not sure if it will influence what kinds of grants will be available or what will be considered legitimate topics in grant proposals.",
            "It is a tough problem, especially as there has been as much as a century of fuel accumulation in many of the systems. The solutions, to the degree that there are ones, depend on the forest community type. Some forest communities, like lodgepole pines, historically burned with high intensity fires that were not necessarily unnatural. Generally, industrial forestry tries to mimic such fires with clearcuts, which both produces a product and avoids catastrophic crown fires, but we obviously do not want to clearcut everything. Doing patch harvests helps break up the fuels to make the fires more manageable, so that is one approach, as well as forest thinning. It will take some time for the forest industry to figure out the best ways to make the forests more wildfire resilient.",
            "Virginia is interesting, like North Carolina, in that it has mountains, Piedmont, and Coastal Plain ecosystems. In the mountains, wildfires are often more common in the fall during dry conditions. In the Coastal Plain and Piedmont, wildfires can occur throughout the year, but tend to be more common in the spring.\u00a0 Across the region, including in Virginia, most wildfires are caused by humans - either by accident or intentionally. Climate change impacts on wildland fire in the region may lead to more flash droughts (rapidly developing droughts) and extreme temperature days, both of which may lead to more wildfires. Intense rainfall is also an expected outcome of climate change and that can reduce wildfire occurrence on one hand, while also potentially increasing vegetative fuels, which can lead to more intense fires.\u00a0 One of the biggest wildfire concerns in the South and across the country is the expansion of the wildland urban interface (WUI) as housing moves into wooded / vegetative areas. This intermix of human development and natural fuels can make for really complicated and difficult wildfire suppression. It is important for folks living in WUI areas to be ready for fire throughout the year and also to understand the importance of practices like prescribed fire for reducing hazardous fuels and wildfire risk. For more information on wildfire safety and mitigation, FireWise USA is a program designed to train homeowners how to prepare for wildfires ([NFPA - Firewise USA\u00ae](https://www.nfpa.org/education-and-research/wildfire/firewise-usa)), and the University of Georgia has a course on firescaping, the practice of using landscaping practices to mitigate wildfire risk, for certified master gardeners ([Ready for Advanced Training? Register for Firescaping! | Trellis Blog (uga.edu)](https://site.extension.uga.edu/mgevp/2024/05/ready-for-advanced-training-register-for-firescaping/)).",
            "I\u2019m sorry, I have not read his work. I will check into it.",
            "Drones or UAVs are some of the most impressive technology that we\u2019re seeing involved in fire management right now. They are being used to track and understand the movement of wildfires, to identify hotspots, and to rapidly create maps.\u00a0 They are also increasingly being used for prescribed fires. In addition to mapping and hotspot identification following prescribed fires, drones are being used as ignition tools. Hardware and software like the Ignis system from Drone Amplified can be programmed to precisely drop small plastic spheres that ignite shortly after hitting the ground. This drone-based system is similar to helicopter-based ignition systems that have been used for decades by agencies to conduct large prescribed fires. This 2023 webinar from the Southern Fire Exchange explores private-contractor examples of drone prescribed fire applications: [https://youtu.be/oWOLTNMi7bc?si=lDW04cYkje0aN02n](https://youtu.be/oWOLTNMi7bc?si=lDW04cYkje0aN02n). In addition, this 2024 Southern Fire Exchange webinar talks about some other technology applications related to prescribed fire in the South: [https://youtu.be/ZrxY1TxOs-E?si=ofiZXaHEWyU2-2kF](https://youtu.be/ZrxY1TxOs-E?si=ofiZXaHEWyU2-2kF).\n\nOther technological advances include near real-time detection of wildfires through satellite remote sensing, as more satellites are launched that have the capability to detect heat. New fire behavior models are in the works that will result in a big step forward in fire behavior prediction, such as FIRETEC. FIRETEC is a 3-dimensional fluid dynamics model that uses extremely detailed 3-D fuel maps, topography, and weather inputs to predict fires in a very realistic way. The 3-D models are created by terrestrial and aerial LIDAR, a laser technology for mapping 3-D objects.\u00a0 These technologies are moving fuels and fire behavior mapping forward in ways that will likely support prescribed fire and wildfire management.",
            "Yes! Burn Bosses are certified individuals who \u201ccall the shots\u201d so to speak on prescribed fires, and they are the ones who take responsibility for the outcome of the burn by signing the authorized prescription. Prescribed fires are controlled fires that we apply to the landscape for a variety of objectives: reducing fuel loads for wildfires (aka uncontrolled fires), promoting specific vegetation for wildlife, or maintaining the aesthetics of a forest. There are lots of factors that go into making sure a fire is \u201ccontrolled\u201d like humidity, wind direction, smoke, fire behavior, neighboring sensitive areas, existing fuel loads and types, tree density, and more. These factors are described by the written prescription. If the fire becomes out of prescription, then the burn must be discontinued. Burn Bosses are certified by their state agencies to make sure they have the knowledge and experience necessary to feel confident in making the call to start and complete a prescribed burn. Each state and even each agency/organization may have different qualifications for burn bosses, but the commonality is their profound knowledge and experience with applying prescribed fire. As an example, here is a link to the certified burn manager course for Florida [Certified Prescribed Fire \u2014 Acreage / Prescribed Fire / Wildland Fire / Forest & Wildfire / Home - Florida Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services (fdacs.gov)](https://www.fdacs.gov/Forest-Wildfire/Wildland-Fire/Prescribed-Fire/Certified-Prescribed-Fire-Acreage)\u00a0.",
            "There is also a title \u201cmix master\u201d for aerial prescribed fire for heli torching. Pretty good one",
            "yes. it\u2019s a requirement to have a certified burn boss design a burn plan for a lot of prescribed fires.",
            "Prescribed fire has a rich history in the southeastern United States. Southeastern flora and fauna have evolved alongside fire on the landscape; historically, the coastal plain region experienced fire every 1-3 years! These fires were caused by both lightning and cultural burning by indigenous communities prior to European colonization. Indigenous groups used fire to clear forests for travel, herd game animals for hunting, and promote the growth of specific forage plants. Even when colonization occurred, burning was still practiced by settlers to maintain forests and agriculture. It wasn\u2019t until 1910, when the Big Blowup wildfire occurred in the Northwest, that the national conversation about fire and forest management changed. Consequently, the U.S. Forest Service launched a nationwide campaign to reduce or eliminate forest fires altogether (see Smokey Bear and Dixie Crusaders). However, unlike in the West, the fire culture was never eliminated in the South. It was greatly decreased when free range cattle ranching was made illegal, but the recent experience with using fire in the South made it easier to bring it back to public lands in the 1970s or so when the agencies finally recognized the ecological and wildfire mitigation benefits of fire. On many private lands, such as in the northern bobwhite quail hunting region of the Red Hills in northern Florida and southern Georgia, frequent prescribed burning has continued uninterrupted to the current day. In 1990, Florida signed the Prescribed Fire Act, which encouraged prescribed burning by reducing liability for certified prescribed burners, and other southern states followed suit. These are some of the reasons that prescribed fire has continued, and will continue, although with challenges, into the foreseeable future.\u00a0",
            "Absolutely. In a broad sense, there is a strong need to connect wildland fire practitioners (firefighters and prescribed burners) with the vast amount of data, information, tools, and research results in ways that can be easily used to make decisions (in the field and in the office).\u00a0 In the field, there are opportunities to connect firefighters and prescribed burners with realtime remote sensing, location tracking, fire behavior, and weather data. In the office, there are opportunities to connect a wide range of existing datasets from historical fire data, fire permit data, fuels treatments, air quality, archived weather, wildlife habitat, and more to help land managers make decisions about prescribed fire at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.\n\nIT professionals can support or work in wildland fire in a wide variety of ways. There are positions in GIS, remote sensing, database management,, field communications (radio, resource tracking, and remote networks), social media and website technology, and probably more things that I can\u2019t think of right now. Wildland fire and prescribed fire include so many different tasks, responsibilities, backgrounds, and professions, especially at the federal and state agency levels.",
            "Very much so. Here in Alberta, for example, the government uses AI for a number of functions related to wildfires: https://pivotal-with-hayete-gallot.cohostpodcasting.com/episodes/how-alberta-wildfire-uses-ai-to-suppress-fires-and-save-lives",
            "I'm not with Dr. Roberts but I have made a career out of wildland fire and have stumbled into a position where I'm regularly involved in the management strategy for wildland fire you are asking about. \n\nFrom 1910 to the late 80s, the federal government was really good at putting out fires. This has increased the amount of fuel in the ecosystem as well as decreased the health of fire adapted ecosystems. It has also impacted the severity, size, and frequency. \"Letting fires burn\" is a bit of a misnomer some Land Management Plans allow for Fire for Resource Benefit. However, these fires are still managed with a strategy other than full suppression. If firefighters aren't on the ground engaged in some sort of activity it's typically for safety reasons and not resource reasons. \n\nIn order for natural resource benefit fires to occur, things really need to line up at the local, regional, and even national level for land managers and fire management to consider it as a fire management strategy.",
            "What role does biodiversity have in making forests more fire resilient? In my area I see replanting of commercial timber being very homogeneous and very dense.",
            "You mention:\n\n\u201cIn a broad sense, there is a strong need to connect wildland fire practitioners (firefighters and prescribed burners) with the vast amount of data, information, tools, and research results in ways that can be easily used to make decisions (in the field and in the office).\u201d\n\nOutside of participating in fire ecology conferences, webinars or consortiums (which I am all for), in your professional opinion, what else could be an efficient way to connect that lack of communication between researchers & the firefighters who implement the plans?",
            "I think of appropriate fire regimes, which make forests more fire resilient, as promoting native biodiversity, rather than biodiversity making the forests more fire resilient. But they go hand in hand. Most of the terrestrial surface of the earth that we consider to be \u201cforests\u201d was not historically covered with dense forests. Tropical rain forests and bottomland forests are examples of naturally dense forests. But most areas with trees had open canopies and grassy or shrubby understories maintained by periodic fires. For example, most of the upland area of the southeastern U.S. was covered by open-canopy pine savannas, and areas with ponderosa pine and douglas pine were similarly open and park-like because of fire. This forest (or woodland, or savanna) structure lets in light that supports a high level of plant biodiversity and associated insect diversity, as well as habitat for many animals species that depend on that forest structure. The periodic fires that maintain such ecosystem structure also keep the fuel loads low, which makes them resilient to wildfire. Conversely, tree plantations typically have very low biodiversity and are prone to wildfires. There is an argument that having such areas to maximize production of forest products frees up space for other forests to be managed for maximum biodiversity, rather than trying to have forests that strike a compromise between productivity and biodiversity, but that is an open debate.\u00a0"

So is her mom. That\u2019s not a mom joke. I actually met her and she\u2019s very sweet.\n\n- Download and learn how to use virtualbox it\u2019s probably the easiest way to start. It\u2019s a virtualization software that you run essentially an operating system within an operating system. It\u2019s open North Korea\u2019s malware on my machine and that\u2019s why it could not spread absolutely anywhere.. it\u2019s useful for learning other operating systems so install Linux on there. I generally recommend Linux mint or Ubuntu. Parallels for MacOS users. If you want to real challenge, install something like freeBSD and learn how to use that.\n\n- The web application hackers handbook is the Bible Web application hacking I always tell people if you read it from cover to cover and do all of the exercises. You\u2019ll absolutely be a really good web app hacker\n\n- Black hat python by Justin is recommended. Justin is a really good dude and does some really amazing projects. I know he knows his shit. In terms of the actual content, the goal is to learn python so don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t fully understand all of the attacks going on. Although he explains them really well.\n\n- for mobile, hacking I don\u2019t know fuck all about it. So ask somebody smarter than me. Georgia I mentioned earlier I did some work in there so I don\u2019t know fucking ask her.\n\n- If you\u2019re interested in macOS hacking there\u2019s just a little bit of a dated book called the macOS hackers handbook I honestly haven\u2019t read it so I can\u2019t speak to the quality, but is the absolute Jesus of macho ass hacking.\n\n- for more macOS stuff there are some books that are called. I think exploiting the macOS Colonel or maybe it\u2019s just called the macOS Colonel highly suggest those but none of these ones are for the faint of heart.\n\n- Use a lot of resources for courses. Security tube is an amazing resource watch anything by a dude named Vivek know who I\u2019m talking about. He has a bunch of shit on there. If you\u2019re starting out, look for beginners shit, go onto Udemy.\n\n- if you want to pay out the ass, but also get a certification that people actually respect there is OSCP by offensive security, but in my opinion, the shit is a little bit overrated\n\n- For programs, you can literally just download and learn right now and nmap is one of the most important ones for beginners. I think metasploit is really important and there\u2019s a shit ton of material out there on it. Learn how passwords are stored and cracking passwords. Even just knowing what that means is important. So look up hashing and no, it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with smoking hash, though that is an optional step\n\nI did see interest in MacOS so here:\n\n- \n\n\nwill post more soon ",

That's just the times they made me aware of. My info has appeared in other data leaks that I can't track down. And I'm very careful.\n\nYour data is ultimately yours to protect. Use strong randomized passwords and 2 factor authentication. Change your passwords often. Store data locally wherever possible. Look into the 3 2 1 backup method. Look into how to harden your browser. Don't click on ads. Don't let your phone store location data on your phone. Don't let apps access data on your phone/computer if they don't need it. Take steps to secure your own home network. Beware of what the smart TVs and speakers on your home network are actually doing. Avoid public wifi. Use a good VPN, even if you trust the network. Use email aliases. Avoid signing up for every subscription and rewards program. Don't click unknown links without scrutinizing them. Limit your social media presence so you're not easily socially engineered. Understand how to tell if a web connection is secure or not, and read into the encryption/security of different messaging platforms. Don't give information to people you aren't certain have authority and need to know, and make sure you give that info securely.\n\nThese are all little things I think everyone can do, and there are many more. It may seem like a lot but every little step counts. Data privacy is a process that one develops over time, even a little bit of security is better than none, and there will always be new threats.",

They will always limit you in some way, usually no phishing and no social engineering (tricking people by say, calling them). Then they list assets you can't touch or IP ranges you can't touch. Often those are the ones they know are vulnerable..... you usually get in anyway because the DoD is a massive organization and massive orgs work via policies and procedures which are completely defficient.\n\n  \nAnyway it's just sorta boring, you're the customer's bitch most of the time, and it's a lot of paperwork.

            "I'd say you have plenty of time and it all depends on how much you can dedicate to it. People talk about \"years of experience\" but that's not really something set in stone in terms of time. I ATE BOOKS for breakfast lunch and dinner (instead of actual food most of the time) because I was REALLY into it. I'd say read read read. Start deciding fairly early which discipline you want to go into, exploit writing, network hacking, mobile hacking, and get yourself all the books you can. Don't just buy hacking books, buy books about the internals of the operating system and read ALL about them. Fiddle around a lot. Be prepared for frustration and be ok with it. Know when to take a break. Most of all just go do it. Like NOW. Go eat books, love them, buy too many computers, experiment. Do it all, just fuck around with shit, learn the command line, learn about how memory works, learn it aaaalllllll haha. To do that you can read books or even just google around, see if you can do what they're doing.\n\n  \nLearn programming languages. Absolutely needed. At the very least a scripting language like python but would also recommend a lower-level one like C and/or C++ (the latter if you hate yourself). It's a lot, you'll be overwhelmed.

That required me to write some custom stuff and use things like slow-polling attacks (you request website info veeerrryyy slowly, taking up a lot of time for the web server), n-days (vulnerabilities that don't have an exploit so had to write them), their mail servers and other such things. Then I noticed the same two IPs showing up, so I essentially surrounded the country with servers that I rented (even some in China to see if there was some special routing). And I did a traceroute using them, if you're not familir with that it basically just tells you the route something is taking to get to a location. I noticed that no matter where you come from it always went through the same two routers.\n\n  \nTraceroute isn't a hacking tool it's a really old network admin tool (though I guess many things double as that). Normally when coming from different locations to a country it will take the shortest route possible - like if you're on the northwest of Russia it'll likely take a route into the country on the Northwest of Russia. For NK it was the same two damn routers eeeevery time, no matter where it was from. That's when I knew I had a chokepoint. So I continued to hit inside assets which is why people saw it was intermittently up and down - that's effective but not AS effective as what I did next. Which is what you're describing, I hit the two routers with a shit ton of rented bandwidth. After a while they just went completely down and any attempts to reach the country (in or out) were met with \"no route to host.\" When I saw wthat message come up I was like \"holy fucking shit\" because I knew what it meant - there was no routing to or from NK.

At first yep, it was just your basic DoS attack. Not just DDoS, they had outdated nginx servers and I found some CVEs that I could write some n-days for for memory exhaustion. That was nifty. I also hit their web servers with slow polling attacks just for additional instability. Then there was the just mass bandwidth attack (DDoS) that hit their DNS, MX, and other similar things.\n\nHowever the (kind of) unique part was that in additional reconaissance I kept noticing these two IP addresses that would come up. I assumed they were some sort of filter, maybe even a censoring filter? Although that didn't make complete sense because their people don't have access to the Internet, only the elite (aka government). So what I did was I rented a bunch of VPSs surrounding the country and some in China specifically (in case there was some special routing from there). I did a traceroute on all of them with some basic distributed computing tools. Sure enough ANYWHERE I was coming from went through those two assets. They were routers. In other words I found their only two points of egress and ingress to the country.\n\nSo I focused most of my attention on those and brought them down with again, yes, just simple bandwidth exhaustion attacks via some open ports. I made requests that would take up a lot of their bandwidth and not a lot of mine (amplifying attack). It worked, when i saw that \"no route to host\" for literally any host within country I knew I'd taken their routing completely down. It was a bit of a holy shit moment.\n\n  \nThe attack itself was absolutely not complicated. It was definitely far more complicated figuring out WHAT to attack. Most DDoS is just straightforward stupid shit, but if you take the time to understand the shape of the network it makes a huge difference as it did in this case. So nah, not that complicated, just kinda creative IMO. And no that doesn't mean i think I'm some kind of super hacker. Just that I planned well, did recon, and executed.",

Since there is no way to get them except from the department, they are a way of showing that someone is held in esteem by that group.\n\nThe origin of the coins has a few different stories but most revolve around military units using such coins as a way to prove their identity in times of war, and a tradition of \"challenging\" other members to produce their coin, which they were supposed to carry at all times.

            "A little different insight than your other replies - most countries would not have a single IP address (or two main IPs that everything routes through, like in this case).\n\nYou can get the IP address of any publicly facing device on the internet. Well, its publicly facing IP anyway. This is necessary because that's how communication works.\n\nThink of it sort of like a telephone number. Which is, by the way, an analogy that works a lot better since mobile phones became a thing.\n\nWhen you want to call or text someone, you find out their phone number. That's like their IP address. You save that with their name. On the internet, domain names are pointed to IP addresses.... you could basically say that just like you sign up for a phone, you put a domain on an IP. Don't worry about the details, it's a bit more complex and not a 1:1 thing, but it's something that is tracked. But on the internet, when your computer or phone needs to find out where a website is so it can request a webpage, it looks up the IP address in DNS.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to explain - once you save their number, you \"text\" their name, not their number, but it's actually using their number. Not their name. THat's the analogy here. You type in reddit.com and in the background, that gets converted to the IP address for reddit)\n\nYou can, for example, use a tool called \"ping\" (among many other tools) to get the IP address of a site. That's handy.\n\nThere's another tool, traceroute, that finds all the hops between you and that site. So when you talk to a web server, your request will go through hops at your local provider, across the internet, to the host's provider, and eventually to the host - the server - the website you're trying to reach.\n\nWhat he noticed was that when he was doing traceroutes to various NK servers, two IP addresses kept popping up in all of the routes. So he was able to figure out that all the traffic was going through just these two devices. Taking them down would take down everything.\n\nI hope that makes sense. :)\n\nI'm glossing over details to try and keep it simple and it already isn't. :)",

Not its job, and there are only a few people who might be persuaded to do anything about it there - meaning email the proper people to see if they care. Those few people are that little liason group the DOS has thats involved with NS stuff. It's not a question of competence, it's a question of attitude. Trust me, this attitude is not unknown - I personally have dealt with it in other agencies when I flipped leads to them, and it's entirely understandable. The agency's job is the agency's job - they aren't going to burn bandwidth on speculative stuff, possibilities, or ideas, unless that's their remit. That's just bureaucracy.\n\nSecond, there are two groups of people who would care. One is US CYBERCOM, the military guys who usually handle offensive cyberwarfare. The second is the NSA, who usually plays defense. Part of the NSAs job is to look at ideas and develop cyber defense policy. If OP wanted the government to care, he had to get it in front of them.\n\nThat said, intelligence agencies are very popular in the US, easily getting 100x the resumes they need, and being bombarded with lots of \"cool\" ideas that aren't necessarily the tools that the mission needs at that particular moment. BECAUSE this is a speculative product, meaning without verifiable intelligence in hand or an urgent need, the problem is to make them CARE.\n\nIf OP wants to get this in front of the government, talk to a cyber defense contractor and see if they're interested in a new product.... That agency has the tools to develop it (if it needs it), and the connections to get some attention to be paid. \n\nIn the meantime, the guy at the other end of the chat box just thinks \"another one\", rolls his eyes and goes back to fielding chats.",

Like if I was casing a house for a burglary and knew they never locked a certain window, then this guy goes and throws a brick through it and now it's all boarded up.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI read the wires article.  Yeah, no shit they don't want to do some of that stuff.  Official attacks require official responses.  I'm one of the advocates against some approaches to offensive cyber warfare because it's so damned easy to authorize when it seems like there will be no response.    It's a similar problem to drones.   The cost of attacking gets removed, so the frequency of the authorization for those attacks increases.

            "> Really the reason they are so interested in what he did is they need to find out what he messed up and figure out what's changed now. Like if I was casing a house for a burglary and knew they never locked a certain window, then this guy goes and throws a brick through it and now it's all boarded up.\n\nThat's exactly what I was suspecting. They probably knew of this vulnerability and were keeping it in their back pocket. Now they have to assess how badly this random citizen has spoiled their operations.",

If you two break up, you could do some damage, and that's a high risk to take.",

He spent some time on the campaign trail covering politcs, met Nixon and all the people around him, etc. He said that eventually you realise that there is no hidden, all-knowing elite pulling the strings - the people in power are just regular fuck-ups like everyone else and they just happened to be born in the right place at the right time.",
            "I think that's the flip side of conspiracy theories--if people can really organize around a shared goal and successfully engage in subterfuge to conceal their true actions and intent over a long period of time, well if they can do it for bad then surely we the people can do it for good.\u00a0 But it's just a ton of short term interests and motivations that people aren't even themselves aware of half the time. I'm fighting for democracy but I'm also running the numbers on my retirement and could use some consulting and lobbying gigs so I just happen, without realizing it, to determine the interests of democracy over the next fiscal year march hand in hand with that of industry x.\u00a0 It's a game of chess but each piece is independently managed by a bunch of four year olds.
