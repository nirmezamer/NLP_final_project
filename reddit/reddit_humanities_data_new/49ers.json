            "The Niners have **exclusive rights** to Aiyuk for the next 3 seasons if they wanted to, and there is (*literally*) nothing Aiyuk can do about it.\n\nHere\u2019s how it breaks down:\n\nHis 2024 cap hit is $14M.\n\nIf the Niners Franchised him next year (2025), his salary would be $23M - $24M.\n\nThe following year (2026) would be Franchise tag $$$ + 25%. That\u2019s $30M.\n\nSo if Aiyuk is demanding anywhere near $30M/year, the Niners can just keep him here thru the end of the 2026 season for an average of $22M/year by tagging him twice.\n\nThe Niners have **100% leverage** here.",
            "They don\u2019t even need to franchise him this year, he\u2019s under contract.\n\nHe could hold out and take the fines, but I think it\u2019ll get solved.\n\nAiyuk deserves a payday but he has to know he\u2019s more Amon-Ra. St. Brown money than JJ.",
            "They have him on his 5th year this year.  And you are right.  They can franchise next year and the year after.  But the cap hit would be brutal with no bonus money to lower the cap hit. \n\nBut you are correct Aiyuk does NOT have the upper hand. Especially with Pearsall and Cowing added to the team.",
            "Assuming they convince him to play under the 5th year option without an extension, a tag next year would be basically a guarantee he doesn\u2019t play or gets traded.",
            "Yup that's basically what the Bengals and Tee Higgins just did. \n\nCoincidentally, Higgins has the same agency (Athletes First) as Aiyuk does. They don't really have many high-profile WR's in their client list and I wasn't surprised they couldn't get a deal done with the Bengals. The only other 2nd-contract player we have that uses Athletes First is Fred Warner, and he reset the ILB market when we extended him. \n\nIf Aiyuk really wants JJ $$, and his agency is willing to fight for it, I could see this playing out the same way as Higgins next season. \n\nWe could tag Aiyuk next season for around $25 million. Then tag him again in 2026 for 120% of the previous year's tag (around $30 million). \n\nThis averages out to $27.5 million/year for those 2 years (2025/2026). It's less if you factor in the 5th year option season, but that's already in place. But those tags are Kyle/Lynch/Paraag's leverage. They can control Aiyuk until the 2027 offseason, and he has zero recourse besides attempting a hold-in and sabotaging his future earinings. He'll be 29 then.  \n\nThe other option next year (besides just signing him to an extension) is to find a trade partner willing to give us value greater than two more years of Aiyuk at $27.5 million/year (or 3 years at $24 million if we trade him this year, factoring the 5th year option). This depends on a few factors - how much Aiyuk's camp is really asking for, how well he plays this season, and even how well Pearsall plays. \n\nOn the other hand, Kyle/Lynch are pretty reluctant to use franchise tags on players. They've only used one on Gould, and that was mostly to control him for that offseason to get a contract negotiated. I could see them not wanting a \"hostage\" in the locker room, and agreeing to a potential trade if Aiyuk refuses to sign a reasonable deal and if a team offers a 1st round pick. Trade Aiyuk, gain a 1st round pick which we can use on another WR, and free up some future cap space for Purdy and others. Basically the Buckner/Kinlaw approach.",
            ">idk why Aiyuk thinks he has the upper hand here\n\nBecause he\u2019s a WR.",
            "The answer is probably his agent",
            "Does he think he has the upper hand, or is he simply trying to play his lesser hand as well as he can?\n\nHe's 26.  By the time he's done quietly and dutifully serving out this contract and a franchise tag he'll be 28, 29 if he gets double-tagged.  Then what is he worth?  If he goes along to get along, that's what will happen.  If he acts out, most likely, the same thing happens.  He's forced to play out this contract and at least one tag.  However, there's a chance the 49ers pay him to appease him, or trade him to a team that will pay him.  There's no downside to acting out and the only potential for upside is in acting out, so he's incentivized to act out, even if it's out-of-character for him.  Being a team-first, unselfish player gets taken advantage of by teams during contract negotiations.",
            "Until he becomes locker room cancer and forces them to ship his ass out",
            "And then what\u2026 you think he balls out or does he join deebo in showing every play where the ball isn\u2019t coming to him",

            "I hate you. \n\nUpvoted cuz you\u2019re right. \n\nBut I still hate you.",

            "No. Well maybe the Panthers? Hopefully Lynch is talking to them \ud83e\udd23",
            "Christian Kirk got 4/72 in 2022. I think Aiyuk could get close to Jefferson from somebody",
            "Probably not. But the only way he'd find out is if we let him explore trades. Which isn't great for us cause it only takes 1 team to offer him more than what we're willing to go for to shut the extension talks down",
            "No, but I don't think a mil or two under that is impossible.  I could easily see him get between AJ Brown and Jefferson.\n\nTherefore, in a negotiation, start at Jefferson to give yourself some wiggle-room.",
            "But roughly the same percentage of the cap as top WRs were making in Brady's final years, so not that crazy.",
            "He\u2019s probably around a top 10 receiver and Amon money makes sense. JJ money is just posturing and while he\u2019s good he is not close to the best in the league. This posturing is because a deal is coming soon the niners have two years of control and it would be career suicide to actually not play or half ass it. Some people say three years control but no team would double franchise tag as that would put him at or above jj money for that year.\n\nEdit:spelling",
            "There are loads of cheap WRs available.  Great players are expensive.",
            "Agree. Hopkins would be a cheap option and still good.",
            "The greedy team that\u2019s netted Trent Williams and CMC. Yes, this totally tracks.",
            "Can you give an example of what you\u2019re talking about? I personally want a FO that gets the most out of any trade",
            "You\u2019re kidding right? Half the league would want Aiyuk. This team has the highest paid player at almost every position, certainly more than pretty much any other team you could name.",
            "stay in school nephew",
            "Bro we have the most players that are top 10 paid at their position. The FO ain't greedy. They're trying to get as close to the cap without going over while having enough to pay Purdy next year. Remember, we paid Deebo not knowing what Purdy would be after his injury. And without knowing how healthy CMC could be. And hell we didn't know BA would completely exceed every expectation this year. \n\nI think BA's situation is tough. Money today is worth more than money tomorrow. But I think BA could make JJ money waiting one more year for a deal. We can offload Deebo, pay Purdy, and have more leeway for how BA's contract is loaded. He can easily get more next year, we can give him a long-term deal that will have him making the Pro-Bowl annually, and probably a couple rings.",
            "Lmao they're setting a high asking price because Aiyuk is a star heading into his prime and because keeping him is what's best for a team contending for the superbowl. The rumor is Aiyuk was up for trade off we could get into a position to draft a top talent to make us better. That makes sense for us. Trading him for a 2nd just cause teams don't want to trade a first make the team WORSE. Why the hell would we make a move that makes us worse during this window?",
            "That also gives them enough time to see if Pearsall can fill in enough that we don't *need* BA anymore (as much of a stud as he is). Really not much leverage here, but we also don't want antics to cause locker room drama, which is the only real concern afaik",
            "Is there not an incredible tackle or guard out there we can swap him with and pay them this instead? Still feel that\u2019s the biggest need",
            "What\u2019s funny is they\u2019re generally seeking 2-3 year deals so they can get one more big contract before they start to age out.  I guess the math works out as long as egos don\u2019t get in the way.",
            "100% is not accurate.  If they were able to extend him instead of franchise tag, it would help lower his cap number.  That's what the front office wants",
            "I always understood this. Just don\u2019t like how players are sometimes. You have someone who wants a number, he doesn\u2019t get it and will he perform better? The same? Or less? Hard to tell and even players who do get paid just started declining cause they got the \u201cbag\u201d.",
            "Fans always tout these extreme scenarios but the 9ers have never gone into this territory. They also never would.",
            "A holdout would also not count as an eligible season meaning we'd still have 3 years of control when he decided to play again",
            "I think the niners are fine with that. Let Pearsall and Jennings show what they got. See if Deebo can stay healthy. If Aiyuk balls out they\u2019ll pay him. If not, they got options.",
            "Convince him? His two options are to play for 14 million this next season or sit out and get nothing. If he sits out he'd better hope that the offense is crap with him gone. That would be the only way he'd create any leverage. That's risky for him.",
            "That would be his problem when we don't re-sign him, and his tape speaks for itself. Either he looks like a problem for new teams looking for WRs, or they overpay.",
            "If he has a shit tier year because he decides to half ass it that only hurts him because playing on his 5YO would mean it's a contract year for him heading into free agency. If he's taking plays off then Shanahan can just scheme the ball to other guys.\n\nAiyuk half assing it out of spite honestly hurts him a lot, but I absolutely don't think he would do that.",
            "Brandon? Is that you?",
            "Because no WR is. Market is overvalued right now, like the housing market. Spiked at an insane level and I believe we can find value elsewhere if forced to.\n\nBA\u2019s contract should be in the 24-25 range tops.",
            "I think he means trading away guys. The Niners have yet to trade away any player, besides Buckner, for anything higher than a 5th. And that one time still leaves a sour taste.",
            "I love but ba, but if they wanted to trade him, they would have a draft for an early 2nd. he isn't worth a 1st.",
            "if that's true why haven't they made a trade then?",
            "But he can fight the tag and play less enthusiastically, get less play time, get replaced, hit free agency, end up with the Cardinals or some other random rebuilding team, play a few years at peak, go nowhere, lower his bid, get bounced around the league, hopefully end up in the CFL, and retire looking back at the \u201cgood years.\u201d\n\nHe had the high ground after all. \n\nAll joking aside, I like BA but I don\u2019t LOVE BA. If that makes sense.",
            "Also gives them enough time for deebo\u2019s contract to become cuttable without a major dead cap hit, allowing them to choose between deebo and aiyuk without dead cap as a factor.",
            "Yes, the 49ers have the leverage to string Aiyuk along year to year for three years while simultaneously grooming a guy they intend to dump Aiyuk for at their earliest convenience.  So, why should Aiyuk be upset about that?",
            "Agreed 100%.\n\nCMC, Kittle, & Deebo\u2019s unique skill-sets are legit irreplaceable. Nobody else in the league plays like any of those three.\n\nAiyuk is\u2026a great route runner?\n\nGive me a top 10 Tackle/Guard for the next 3 years over BA 10 times out of ten.",
            "You\u2019re comparing apples to oranges.",
            "Well, it is a balancing act.. the player wants to play well so SOMEONE signs him to a contract after.",
            "Imagine if him and his agent somehow didn't know this \ud83d\udc80",
            "Then why not just trade him instead of a year of a disgruntled guy playing below his ceiling that we\u2019re going to let go",
            "Might as well be given how irrationally people here have turned on him just because he wants what he\u2019s worth. Fickle ass fanbase",
            "Hmmm if the top WRs are all moving in that range\u2026 might be that they\u2019re worth it.\n\nYall take arbitrary numbers and pass it off as fact. 24-25m is just a random number that makes fans feel comfortable",
            "Even then, why would the team trade away a player for peanuts? They got a solid haul for Buckner, it just so happens that Kinlaw didn\u2019t pan out. They could only afford 1 of their 2 FA D-Lineman and AA played out his contract with solid value.",
            "...because they don't want to? Preference seems to be to keep him and only trade if they can't reach a deal.",
            "Because nothing they'd get in return is worth losing a WR like Aiyuk.",
            "I LOVE BA, but I also understand it's a business and can be cut throat at times. And I'm a 49er fan first, player fan second. If BA wants to make ridiculous demands then that's just too bad and I hope we find someone to take his place.",
            "The problem with BA mailing it in is that he won\u2019t get the money he wants in free agency if he does that. He has to ball out if he wants to get the bag somewhere else.",
            "I agree completely.\n\nI like Aiyuk. He\u2019s a great route runner, and a good blocker. The former is a core trait of his, the latter is 100% because of his current HC.\n\nHow many great route runners are there in the League? 12? 15? 18? More?\n\nIf Aiyuk goes to another team, and no longer has the threat of Shanny putting him in the doghouse for not blocking\u2026do you honestly think he\u2019s going to continue putting in the same effort downfield?\n\nAiyuk is a WR2+ / WR1- and the entire league knows it \u2014 including the Niners FO. If you think Aiyuk is elite, then you\u2019re *clearly* new to watching Football.",
            "It goes back to what BA is looking for in the first place - money. Specifically, guaranteed money. SF definitely doesn\u2019t want to go the tag route, since it\u2019s tough to manage around the cap and it wastes trade value. However, BA has no incentive to sandbag his performance under those tag years. All that does is cost him money when he becomes a UFA.",
            "Honestly, if CMC stays healthy and we have a solid rb2 (looking at Mason or Guerendo tbh), keeping BA and trading Deebo to like the Chargers or something (AFC pls, that man holds grudges \ud83d\ude02) would be ideal. My issue is I think BA would feel disrespected by the tag and want to leave :/",
            "A third consecutive franchise left tackle would be the most on-brand thing for the modern Niners besides a thumping linebacker corps, which we already have.",
            "I think you are failing to grasp the salary cap ramifications of franchise tagging him for any number of years.  There is an opportunity cost affixed to that.  Sf knows this. Aiyuks agent knows this.  It's a point of leverage in BAs favor.",
            "Yeah, but you have to take it on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIf a player is going to be a UFA, and isn\u2019t likely to be tagged? This behavior is warranted.\n\nIf they\u2019re in the position Aiyuk is in, it just looks silly.",
            "Because nothing we'd get in return is going to help us win a Super Bowl this year more than having him on the team. Unless it's a star offensive lineman (it wouldn't be). \n\nThe most likely return would be draft picks, and they are not going to be until next year's draft. And the players picked with them likely won't really help until the year after or later when they develop a bit.",
            "And he's be motivated to play well. If his performance goes down so does his future earning potential.",
            "We also didn\u2019t trade away Garoppolo, when everyone expected him to be traded. There was literally a year-long meme over this. We did get a few wins from him when Trey got hurt, but who\u2019s to say Purdy wouldn\u2019t have done the same? That\u2019s an L.\n\nWe didn\u2019t trade away Deebo when now it looks like he isn\u2019t going to live up to his contract. This is looking like an L unless Deebo has a 2021-like season.\n\nNow the question is should we trade away Aiyuk?\n\nIf history is any indicator, we will not trade him, which means we either pay him or he\u2019s holding out.",
            "I fucking love BA but I agree. Homeboy needs to stop thinking he\u2019s untouchable even if on the field he is lol. Bang bang with or without you BA, I\u2019m rooting for you tho",
            "Same.  I want BA on this team but we can\u2019t reset the market for every free agent that\u2019s due for a contract.  It\u2019s the weird part of pro sports.  You want your guys to get paid but the cap means it\u2019s gonna have to be lean somewhere else.",
            "I think this team creates such a warped reality. Aiyuk is a WR1 all day. We don\u2019t see it because he\u2019s behind Deebo and CMC. It\u2019s literally like losing Trey, and Jimmy and seeing Brock come up and be a superstar. Brock is not a third string QB, Josh Johnson is what a 3rd string QB looks like going into a game. Don\u2019t let the fact that we have the most stacked roster in the NFL cloud your perceptive of BA. He\u2019s the all star on any other team.",
            "Nah. Teams know who he is and will know if he\u2019s playing down.",
            "I\u2019m confused. Are you comparing Trey \u2014 who will be struggling to earn a UFL roster spot shortly \u2014 with Aiyuk?",
            "No. I\u2019m making the claim that him being the 3rd target on the Niners is not indicative that he\u2019s a \u2018WR2+\u2019 elsewhere. The point being that our roster being absolutely stacked skews reality for us.",
            "If he was a WR1, he would be target #1.\n\nPoint. Blank. Period.\n\nWhen a wideout\u2019s biggest strength is \u201croute running\u201d followed by \u201cblocking\u201d? That is not a description of a guy who is elite.",
            "You are underestimating being good at route running. Guys like Keenan Allen, Davante Adams, Diggs, Cooper. That\u2019s their main trait. None of them block like Aiyuk does, so that\u2019s a plus for him. \n\nAnd why are we gonna act like he doesn\u2019t have good hands and provide good Yac? I think the better question is besides not being a big body jump ball guy, what doesn\u2019t he do good?"

He wasn't an elite level DL at ANY point in his tenure with the Niners.  DJ Jones was actually taking on Double teams and getting pressure up the middle which made Armstead's job easier AND gave better opportunities for Bosa to get sacks.\n\nThey have lost the NFCCG twice and the Super Bowl twice.... and they CLEARLY could have won those games IF they were a WCO.... IF they protected Jimmy G and Purdy.... NO TREY LANCE..... UGH.... THREE 1st round draft picks..... GOOD GOD MAN.\n\nI mean how can you even consider my comments to be satire.\n\nConsider this:\n\nIf the Niners score on their first possession instead of a FG in SB LIV.... AND if they scored a TD instead of FG in the first possession of the 2nd half (after adjustments) they would have been leading by 18 not 10 when they intercepted Mahomes for the 2nd time in the game in the 4th quarter.   They should have won that Super Bowl..... with DK instead of Deebo.  He would have made the difference.... IF they were passing to set up the run.\n\nTHEN you add in Lamb and you think they would have lost the NFCCG to the Rams?  No.... They would have beaten Cincy too.  That's TWO Super Bowls.... both wins for Jimmy G.\n\nAfter that who knows.... but if Purdy did end up replacing him or beating him out in camp.... The Niners would be DOMINANT right now.... and not the old Bills of 90's.... How many Super Bowls did they lose?  4 in a row.  SMH.\n\nImagine this offense.\n\nDK  OLine with a better RT.  Kittle  Lamb\n\nPurdy\n\nCMC , Jusz\n\nPassing to set up the run..... passes in the flat to CMC like they used to do with Craig.... and then faking that and throwing to a WIDE OPEN Jusz on the other side running a wheel route.\n\nI mean COME ON MAN!  York, Shanny, Lynch have FUCKED US out of at least two Super Bowl victories.  AT LEAST TWO!.... probably more.  Dumbasses!",
            "Makes me wish it was. We could probably get rid of some of this dead weight and get some players who can make an impact.",
            "You know there is a difference between the owner and the GM... *right?*\n\nAnd the GM put enough talent on that field to win.  Players didn't execute.  \n\nLynch isn't just playing foosball here.",
            "And LOOK at the down votes from the \"faithful\".... It's sad what has become of the 49er fan base.  Most of you have never even seen the Niners win a Super Bowl.  If they keep going like this you probably won't see one any time soon.",
            "have an upvote, three in fact.",
            "York is a TERRIBLE owner.  Even if you allow Shanny telling him \"We're gonna be a (form) of the WCO.... which they're not.  They are a run to set up the play action team.... EVEN IF you allow that.... At what point do you begin to question the ability of your GM and Coach to draft talented players to make your team better and win Super Bowls?\n\nSolomon Thomas, Rueben Foster, Trey Lance, Javon Kinlaw, Brandon Aiyuk... The ONLY impact player they have drafted in the 1st round is Nick Bosa.... pretty much a no brainer wouldn't you say?  Just look at the ridiculous drafts the Niners have had since those two jackasses have been in charge.\n\nThen you look at the offensive scheme, play calling and clock management of your coach.  HOW DO YOU BEAT THE RAMS 7 TIMES IN A ROW AND THEN LOSE THE NFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME?????  HOW???\n\nAnd WHY would you have a 2nd string TE trying to block Haason Reddick?  Hmmm?  Talk about NOT protecting your franchise QB.\n\nAnd speaking of Mr. Irrelevant.... Lynch and Shanahan didn't even know what they had with Purdy.  They just GOT LUCKY!!!\n\nSo of course I know the difference between a Bad owner, Bad GM and Bad Coach.  The owner should know more about football.... He should know enough to see that Shanny is NOT running a WCO and never intended to.  Then we he hears that his idiot GM wants to trade THREE 1st round draft picks for the 3rd pick in the draft and (according to sources) they're not even sure which QB they want the most..... AND ALL OF THEM END UP BEING BUSTS... Lance, Fields and Jones.... and even Zach Wilson is a bust too.... It's pretty clear by that point that your GM doesn't know shit either.",
            "You're getting down voted because you are typing what ifs, and sounding like a total jerk.",
            "You couldn't do much more to make it sound like you know nothing about this team.\n\n* Shanahan has never claimed he runs the west coast offense.  For the most part he's always been a wide zone guy here.   They don't run to set up the play-action (that was more a crutch relied on in his early seasons here.\n* Imagine calling All-Pro WR Brandon Aiyuk not an impact player.  Lol.\n* And who cares if you miss on a 1st round pick if you nail the other picks?  They've built a team that has contended for multiple SB titles.  Trying to claim they didn't do good with roster management is pretty silly.\n\n>HOW DO YOU BEAT THE RAMS 7 TIMES IN A ROW AND THEN LOSE THE NFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME????? HOW???\n\n* By having an awful owner, obviously... /s\n\n>And WHY would you have a 2nd string TE trying to block Haason Reddick? Hmmm? Talk about NOT protecting your franchise QB.\n\n* It's called a pass-blocking specialist.  Every team has them.  Every team runs 2-TE or even 3-TE sets.  And by Brock's own admission he had enough time to get rid of the ball and didn't.\n\n>It's pretty clear by that point that your GM doesn't know shit either.\n\nYup.  Pretty clear that this team hasn't contended for multiple SBs because of their terrible roster.\n\nBut again, not one of those things has anything to do with the owner.",
            "IF I had anything to say about it there is NO WAY I would have let Lynch / Shanny draft Deebo over DK Metcalf.\n\nAlso.... since they would have one Pro Bowl WR.... I would have lobbied for them to get THE OTHER ONE.....  Cee Dee Lamb.  That's who I was hoping for when they drafted Kinlaw.  I was so disappointed.\n\nSo I would have lobbied for a WCO.... If I was the owner I would have said.... it's a passing scheme or I'll hire a different coach.... got it?\n\nSee the problem is that Shanny is playing the wrong scheme.  It LOOKS like it works when you have the whole field to deal with.... but as soon as the field shrinks you don't have the BIG PHYSICAL wide receivers who can get open and make plays in the Red Zone.  This is why they end up kicking Field Goals.\n\nI also would NOT have been in favor of letting DJ Jones go.  He was doing a great job.... better than Kinlaw that's for sure.\n\nAnd I would have NEVER.... EVER let them trade three 1st round picks.  R U INSANE?  That literally NEVER works out.  No matter who you think you're getting.\n\nIf fans want to downvote me for pointing out THE OBVIOUS then it just illustrates how little they know about football.... so I'm okay with it.",
            "And you're a perfect example of why they keep losing... because the fans just accept it and they say well, \"Yeah, we're contending for a Super Bowl championship. We're contending. We keep contending\".\n\nSo the owner doesn't know how to hire a good coach.\nThe GM doesn't know how to select talented players. Especially in the first round.\nAnd the coach doesn't understand that this is a passing league. And he should look to people like Bill Walsh and his philosophy on how to win, rather than be a one dimensional team that gets field goals instead of touchdowns.\n\nBut hey, we're contending for a Super Bowl, contending yeah, contending!!!"
