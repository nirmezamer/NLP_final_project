The mouse was originally called an \"X-Y Position Indicator for a Display System\" and was first used with the Xerox Alto computer system in 1973. Using the mouse, Douglas demonstrated moving a mouse cursor on the Alto computer in The Mother of All Demos. However, because of its lack of success, the first widely used mouse is the mouse found on the Apple Lisa computer.",

            "At least when he [wasn't abusing the shit out of his daughter.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/u9po1l/what_beloved_person_in_history_should_be_hated/i5ugdh4/):\n\n>-They made Lisa sleep on the first floor next to the kitchen while the rest of the family slept on the top floor. Initially she was the only child and all the rooms upstairs were empty but they still made her sleep on the first floor. One by one the other kids were born from Steve and Laurene Powell and were given rooms on the 2nd floor. The first floor had broken heating and she was constantly cold, while everyone upstairs enjoyed heating. Its California, but keep in mind that she's a petite girl who reached and adult height of 5'2\", and it is the Bay Area where in the winter temp would reach in the 40's \u00b0F. She would constantly beg Steve to fix the heating, he always refused\n\n>-Every time she would start excelling at extra-circular activities, her Dad would complain that she was not spending enough time with her family. He was say stuff like 'You know Lisa, I feel that you really don't want to be a part of this family'. When Lisa quit her activities to be with her family more, him and his wife Laurene would just give her Reed Jobs (their son, only a baby at the time) to babysit, and they would go out to some party or event\n\n>-They finally invite Lisa to come to a wedding. She was excited about it and planned for weeks about enjoying an event with her dad and step mom. She got a dress and everything. At the hotel room, after she's finished getting dressed and putting on her makeup, they hand her the baby and leave her behind to babysit in the hotel room while they enjoy the wedding\n\n>-She always wanted a NeXT computer like how Steve and Laurene each had one. Steve finally got her one, but when she tried it didn't work. Steve took it away, and never replaced it. This one may seem minor, but it's actually a part Steve's habit of dangling hope in front of her, and taking it away, like with the wedding (my interpretation, not hers)\n\n>-When she was at her Mom's house (which was Steve's, he owned the house), Steve hired a child molester to be the gardener. I don't think he was ever convicted so her Mom couldn't remove him. But he was accused by his own children. Her Mom would constantly scream and cry for Steve to remove him. He refused.\n\n>-Btw, if you are wondering where her Mom is in all this, and why Steve let Lisa live with her if he hated her so much: Lisa's mom was also emotionally unstable; Lisa was often the victim of her temper tantrums, because she felt that Lisa took away her life. Lisa confided this to her school counselor, who would tell Steve, who didn't care. Finally the school counselor threatened to call social services if Steve didn't do anything, which would be a PR nightware, so he begrudgingly took her in. From reading other books on Steve, if he's forced to do something, he does it very passive aggressively. From Lisa's book, it seems his abuse towards Lisa was like 'ok you forced me to take in Lisa, but you can't force me to give in to your ultimate demand of her being treated properly' (my interpretation, not hers)\n\n>-Steve told Lisa he would take her in, but only if he had cut all contact with her Mom for 6 months, to prove to him that she really wants to be a part of his family (A line Steve repeatedly used on Lisa to manipulate her into doing things didn't want to do, and quitting things she did like doing, like cutting school for a family vacation 2 weeks before finals). Even though Lisa had a fucked up relationship with her Mom, she still loved her\n\n>-Cutting of contact with her Mom for 6 months fucked up the Mom emotionally even more, though she initially welcomed the change, saying that she needs a break from her (my interpretation was that she didn't want her to feel guilt for her decision). But the cutoff did have a effect on the Mom's already fragile psyche. When they met for dinner after the 6 months, her mom out of nowhere threw a tantrum about how Lisa abandoned her, that all she wants to do is hangout with rich people. I believe Lisa was only 9 years old when she had to endure this\n\n>-Lisa's chores included dishes, but they refused to fix the dishwasher for years. One day she had the initiative to fix it on her own. While her parents were away, she got a repairman to find the problem, turned out to be a 40$ fix. She was really proud of herself. She told Steve hoping to finally impress him. When she told him, he frowned. The next day he replaced the dishwasher with a new one. He wanted to remove all artifacts of Lisa's accomplishments (my interpretation, not hers)\n\n>-Lisa got really into debate club. At her first big regional tournament, she got first place. Tied for first place actually. The first one to the podium would get the trophy. Lisa frantically rushed there because she wanted to show Steve the trophy to impress him (at the time, Lisa thought only if she impressed Steve enough, he would start to appreciate her). When she showed him the trophy, he made her quit. His excuse was that debate club is not useful in the real world , my interpretation is that he wanted to remove anything that would giver her a semblance of self-esteem (my interpretation, not hers)\n\n>-Whenever Steve would see a homeless person, he joked that's who Lisa is going to marry. Whenever he saw a strip club, he joked that's where Lisa is going to work. The strip club joke started when she 9 years old\n\n>-Lisa's therapist invited Steve and his 2nd wife Laurene Powel to a meeting with Lisa to get them to spend quality family time with Lisa.

As the Napoleonic war came to an end, the actual cause of the war became moot and peace was made.

            "Actually the aims of the war were achieved by the US. A lot of people think we wanted to conquer Canada and there were a small minority in Congress who really pushed that narrative but no one thought that was possible and it was not the reason for the war. We went into the war because England was not respecting our neutral trade status and they were forcing American sailors who they basically kidnapped off our merchant vessels to serve in their ships. This combined with the fact they were in violation of the treaty of Paris because they refused to move their troops out of the western territories led to the war. So why did we invade Canada if our issues with Britain were mostly maritime? Short answer: because we aren\u2019t stupid. We knew that we couldn\u2019t compete with Britain in a naval fight so we fought them where we could and hoped that the British were too preoccupied with the ongoing Napoleon and Napoleon related issues in Europe to properly supply the conflict. And when the dust settled Britain moved their troops out of American territory and stopped fucking with our boats. Thusly all war goals were achieved they just weren\u2019t very flashing empire building war goals and therefore it was a total victory for the United States. (Side note: we also burned down Canada\u2019s capitol so hard they completely moved it. So it\u2019s one for one on the capitol burnings)",

It also changed the US from the viewpoint of the world from just a former colony to more of a player on the world stage, which combined with the American defeat of the Barbary pirates gave the United States respect it didn't have before. \n\nNot sure who views the war of 1812 as a loss for the US, because that's just a dumb thing to believe. Had the US lost it certainly would have had to give up territory, which it didn't, and the terms of the Treaty of Ghent would not have Great Britain give up claims to territory and stop enslaving Americans.

            "15,000 of your soldiers and literally uncounted numbers of noncombatants died\n\nBut hey, that's  'nothing' to you, right?",
            "And the argument fir that is usually along the lines of \"yeah, but we killed A LOT of people so we won\". Despicable.",
            "Yeah but it's a pretty big thing to have under you belt.",
            "Anyone want to educate this guy on Canada's involvement in both WW1 and WW2?",
            "Not everything with a flag on it is making a specific reference to the anthem now is it",
            "The main objectives of the U.K. were also achieved.",
            "Fair enough I guess, militarily it's not like anything changed in regards to the Northern border, but America definitely fucked Spain up a little bit. You're right there's more to it than territory though.",
            "No, they didn't.\n\nAre Americans really so nationalist they class losing as winning? That's some North Korea shit lol",
            "You forgot the project manager. I mean, who else will lead scrum?",
            "Also the \"team\" is just one guy with 12 bosses.",
            "They would for sure need a compliance architect to properly build this team.",
            "Honestly, I disagree. I think this is less of an issue of \"We didn't want to deal with them for ease of use\" and more of an, \"We had no fucking clue about the implications of what we were doing.\"\n\nI've worked with a few companies on projects like this, and it's always very painless to get everything going. Especially since it takes months to even plan something like this, there is plenty of time to wait during the early days when the DNS/ proxy reservation needs to be made. Most of the time these things only take 30 minutes to get setup anyway, and they'll do it with you on the phone in some cases, especially if it's over proxy and not DNS.\n\nAlso, there's literally no reason for this to be refused. It's likely they were hosting the site on their own servers already anyway, and if it was being hosted on some private agency servers then that's even more of a reason to run it through a company owned subdomain, because then you have some level of direct control over the site. If something is catastrophically wrong and you can't reach anyone at the agency that can help you immediately, you can always remove the designation and the problem is at least on hold immediately. \n\nIt just seems like some executive asked some agency to do something for cheap, and the agency had no idea what they were doing and the executive had no clue anything was wrong. Regardless, no matter how you look at this, a subdomain was the right call.",
            "Hey uh bud\u202615,000 would\u2019ve been .2% of the total us population at the time, and this was during a several decade stretch where the US population growth rate was *never* less than 30%. The population nearly doubled between 1810 and 1830. Also 15,000 is the higher end estimation of total US deaths so it may have been less than that. The war of 1812 also saw the defeat of Tecumseh\u2019s confederacy (not saying this is good but it was a large confederation of native tribes so it\u2019s definitely a big deal). \n\nMan numbers are fun huh? Especially when you actually know what you\u2019re talking about. \n\nNow the war *did* hurt the US economy quite a bit (the British economy as well) and limited immigration for a few years, but it also led to a reinforced spirit of independence in the US and led to the US creating a stronger navy. So you know it had several long lasting effects on the US and basically none of them were negative. We certainly didn\u2019t win the war, but we didn\u2019t really lose it either.",

Can you hear me bro we owned you!\"\n\nMeanwhile we are making our license plates. Funny part is most of us think it was the British and don't even realize/care Canadians were involved at all.",

            "Well in this case it is.",
            "No idea, but as far as the War of 1812 is concerned, the US achieved its objectives. That\u2019s why it\u2019s seen as a win in the US.",

            "Occupied, yes. But they weren't conquered, and the occupying force did not rule over the people. The German people continued to govern themselves. Germany didn't become a state. And Britain, as well as Canada and many other countries, have soldiers stationed at American bases all over the US. Lots of countries do it.",
            "You must be new here. I've seen this many times. Usually the term \"pyrrhic victory\" or direct stats about casualty ratios are used to show \"we didn't actually lose\".",
            "Canada, of course, was involved from the start, unlike some latecomer countries we could mention ...",
            "True, though I hesitate to project it that far into the future, strong navies were more or less the status quo of the western world by the end of the 19th century so it\u2019s entirely possible the US would\u2019ve done it anyway even without the incentive of the war of 1812 (but I\u2019m also far from an expert so don\u2019t quote me on that).",

            "Ya I agree. But if the UK had \u201cwon\u201d the War of 1812 and taken over the Americas like before the revolution, the development of the US and the world wars probably wouldn\u2019t have turned out the same.\n\nThe UK was concerned about helping their own island, while sucking the resources from their colonies. When the US became independent, they could focus on their own, unique, economy. \n\nThe UK had control of India through both WWs and took troops and resources to help their homeland. I bet India would be a major world power (they kind of are now but every more so) if they had sovereignty 200 years ago like the US.  \n\nColonialism stifled India\u2019s growth and I think the war of 1812/revolutionary war prevented the US from falling into the same fate.",

You sure as shit can't be said to have won, that's for sure.",

            "India wouldn't be one country if it were let go by the British hundreds of years earlier, it'd have broken up into smaller countries. Different parts of India are extremely culturally distinct from one another.",
            "You can't see farts, silly. Only the paint they peel off the walls.",
            "Yes, and the US didn't join until they were attacked. If the US joined when Canada (England) did just because they want to fight in a war that wouldn't be justified in my opinion."

A couple years ago I was in a hot tub with some friends. We\u2019d all had a little to drink, not drunk though, and smoked a little as well. One of my friends takes medicine for high blood pressure. The combination of that, the alcohol, and the smoking, made him pass out from low blood pressure. He was out out, and we had to call 911. He came to before the ambulance arrived, but we had to keep his head above water, he was unable to do that himself. Later at the hospital, the ER nurses said that this happens a lot and to never ever get in a hot tub alone. If he had been alone, he would have died. None of us were drunk or partying hard.
