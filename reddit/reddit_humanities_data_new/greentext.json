            "Why is a foot this long? I don't know anyone with a foot this long, my feet are huge and they're still a cm off.\n\nAnd most of the units are straight up nonsense because they lost all meaning from the past. A mile means a thousand because it was a thousand paces, which is a barely used unit now and means a single stride (again most people have much smaller strides so good job again) but a modern thousand paces are much smaller than a mile so a mile has no connection to the real world whatsoever.\n\nAnd Fahrenheits are really funny because DG Fahrenheit was a hack and a fraud and neither 0F nor 100F have any meaning as he couldn't do anything right.",
            "Americans really don't know that their scientific community, their industries, their military and other american key sectors already use (and are required to use) the metric system.

            "I'd say Anon sorta has a point in that e.g. the meter's definition is quite stupid (idgaf what you think  \"1/299792458 of the distance light travels in a second\" makes no practical sense).\n\nThe problem with the imperial system is not the basic units (which are themselves defined in terms of the metric ones lol, a foot is officially defined as  0.9144 meters but ok let's say you could come up with a precise definition), it's the fucking stupid conversion factors like \"how many inches are in a foot\" that make no sense at all like dude ffs just choose one unit and work in base 10 with it\n\nEdit: I never said we should go out of our way to change the metric system nor that the imperial system is somehow superior to metric, you fucking baboons, I'm just stating that for once Anon has a point, even though his conclusion is stupid and the imperial system does suck ass.",

            "Ya using an imperial measurement from 2,000 years ago. Btw it's not an American concept and the only reason we used it at all was in spit of the British. Metric is more accurate and more easy to grasp it's also why most tools today use mm instead of fractional tools that are less specific and can't be small enough in some cases or large enough.",

            "Sorry Anon, I don't speak wrong. Metric was one of the 2 things I am grateful to French for. Second one is pasteurization.",

            "American 1",
            "The reason America doesn't use the metric system is because after WW2 when many English and European factories rebuilt and remade all their tools in metric there was no need to remake American factories and redoing the tooling was an expense no one wanted to do.",
            "The imperial system is handy for \"close enough\" stuff. 1 cup? About this much. Into the pot. Tablespoon? Something like this, into the pot. Do that a few more times, and the chicken dip is complete, it's going to be delicious.",

            "The meter was originally created as a portion of what they thought was the distance to the earth's core. It's only when they realized their intial calculation was wrong that they changed it into a portion of distance travelled by light per second.",

            "Thats the most 1800\u2019s french redditor shit I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nHow does knowing that help you in everyday measurements? A teaspoon is the amount of liquid it takes to fill a teaspoon. A meter is the distance that light travels in 1/299k of a second, how the fuck does that help anyone",
            "They use it for interoperability with allies. It started in WW1 when American solders needed to use French maps of the front so they adopted metric for distance, then in 1957 the military switched over to full metric because of NATO STANAG requirements",
            "Does Chad use metric tho",
            "I think many people forget, if the americans change to metric, we will lose so much meme potential.  \nIs the advancement of a single country really worth that much?",
            "They use metric anyway, they just don\u2019t know it \n\n\u201cVarious definitions have been used; the most common today is the international avoirdupois pound, which is legally defined as exactly 0.45359237 kilograms\u201d",

            "The metres definition is not to make it more tangible, it's so all SI units can be recreated anywhere in the universe instead of basing them off arbitrary standards which introduces error. No one uses these scientific definitions in day to day life. And as you said, imperial's official definitions are based on metric anyway so what point are you making?",
            "typo: yard not foot.",
            "The definition on a meter is anything but stupid, it was changed to that because the speed of light is the one thing we're almost certain is an universal constant. Taking this definition, we're sure that everybody, at any location, or any point in time, use the exact same meter.",
            "It sort of makes sense, but it also very much doesn't. What the hell is a foot? My foot is different than yours. I wear size 13, anyone wearing like 10 or under isn't even comparable.",
            "You can also use different ways to measure out a Meter, for example a cubic decimeter of distilled Water weighs exactly 1kg. Therefore using a Weight and a cubic container you can define a Meter as 10 times the length of that cubic container.",
            ">makes no practical sense\n\nOh it makes a ton of practical sense.\n\nJust not in your tiktok scrolling fastfood eating doomer sad life.",
            "That would be because powder is measured in grams ;)\n\nBut it really depends on who wrote the recipe. I've seen both.",
            "Fun fact, most cookbooks actually define how many grams are contained in a teaspoon in the context for the book. They also define stuff like pinch, table spoon etc.",
            "No because youd put X amount of grams of baking powder in. Good job you failed at the start.",
            "Banking is chemistry and it definitely matters",
            "I think nautical miles actually makes the most sense conceptually, it's only annoying that it's divided based on 360 degrees and 60 minutes, rather than base 10",
            "UK uses metric and has since '65, about the only thing in the old system is car speeds. Bahamas and Belize use a mix of both, but you did miss Liberia which was a US colony and uses US units. Also worth nothing that there was always difference between imperial measurements and US Customary measurements (mostly volume iirc), so 'Americain measurements' does actually makes sense.  \n1 gallon in the uk is 1.20000something gallons in the US   \npints and fl oz are different too.  Belize and I think the Bahamas as well use UK gallons rather than US ones.",
            "Virgin 20 cm vs chad 8 inches",
            "It's even better: Imperial units are defined by metric. One inch is not about 2.54 cm, it's _defined_ as 2.54 cm. So americans use metric all the time, just in the most convoluted way possible.",
            "Oh really, base 12? How many feet are in a yard? Is that base 12? And how many yard are in a mile? Is that base 12?\nImperial had no base, that's why it's so disliked.",
            "Do you like decimals or fractions is also a dividing factor.",
            "But 90 degrees F is also a hot day, and 10 degrees F is also a cold day, so you still have to learn the specific numbers.",

            "If you want to live in hell, sure.",
            "American way? You mean adopting someone else's stuff and then calling it your own?\n\nSounds about right...\n\nImperial measurements were around before immigrants even went to America and settled there. They simply brought their native measurements with them. They're a measuring system brought by immigrants, and illegal ones at that. They just showed up with no visa or green card and started measuring stuff in feet, inches, and yards.",
            "Nah, rail gauge is based off the wheel ruts left by their chariots",
            "what a completely everyday object that isnt arbitrary at all !!!",

            ">some kings foot\n\n>unlike arbitrary French nonsense\n\nYou can't make this shit up lmao",
            "Not earth's core. A meter is one millionth the distance between the equator and the north pole, one quarter of earth's circumference. Theoretically, earth should be exactly 4 million meters in circumference. But the frenchies did the math wrong so their meter was a smidge too short.",
            "Because your teaspoon can be 30% bigger than mine. Its important for the units to be constant. Old unit definitions were based on physical things and changed overtime which lead to discrepancies. Every base unit of the SI system is tied to unchangeable physical laws nowadays. Besides scientific definitions of the imperial system units base on metric units anyway.",
            "That helps with precision, and that is the modern definition of a meter. The original definition of a meter was 1/40'000'000th of the Paris meridian, which is also kinda arbitrary, but at least everything else in SI is derived from that in increments of 10, which is more sensible than whatever the fuck inbred English aristocratic incest babies made up.\n\nP.S. Not all teaspoons are the same, fuckface, and scientists who dabble in precision will snap your neck when you even suggest using imperial seriously \n\nP.P.S. Ironically, the United States defines all imperial units in metric",

            "I genuinely have 3 different sized teaspoons though",
            "It feels like a classic case of one-uppism where the former is a measurement using a widely used common implement that can be found in nearly house-hold and the other is a giga-specific measurement of something unquantifiable to the average human in a way to seem superior when really its arbitrary measurement that, sure, is *universally* able to be used (Since the speed of light is constant) but your granny ain't a rocket scientist and doesn't care.\n\n  \nIts also really funny to me when you ask a Euro's height and they say some shit like \"173.5 cm\" as if thats better and easier to visualize than 5'9 (Five, one-foot increments plus 9 inches)",
            "They also use it because when you use Imperial your Mars probe crashes:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter",

            "My point was that since the meter is just an arbitrary fraction of that distance you might as well choose a multiple that makes it close-ish to something to which you have a tangible reference, as it is it's just some random ass number which is close-ish to 1/10'000'000 the distance of the equator to the pole, which nobody fucking cares about.

It is simply now as you mentioned, how far light travels in a vacuum, in 1 second, divided by 299,792,458.\n\nYou could say having it divided by that is stupid, but the unit system still needs to make sense for everyday use, there's no point having a standardized unit that is exactly just how far light travels in a second. What use would we have for a length 299,792,458 meters long? What use would we have even having this divided by 100,000,000 to get 2.99792 meters? I don't recall often times in my life I've measured things around 3 meters long. But things longer and shorter than a meter? All the time.\n\nYou have to balance the use case to universal constants. Each SI unit is supposed to have easy usage, with some minor exceptions. Seconds are a good length of time to count in. Meters are a good middle ground for most everyday measures of distance, Kilograms are a good measure of weight and so on. Each of these units can be mathematically tied to a universal constant. It doesn't matter that a meter is how far light travels in a second in a vacuum divided by 299,792,458 - you don't need to know that. That knowledge is just so as a previous commentator mentioned, if you're in another part of the world, or on another planet elsewhere, and a diagram says, this part is 1.5 meters, you can know exactly how long that is simply using light.\nTry to imagine every meter ruler in the world was destroyed. The constant the unit is based on is just an instruction book on how to work out that ruler again and get the same answer every time.\n\nIn regards to your ideas around time units, that's massively arbitrary too. How exactly do you propose using the average resting heart rate as a measure for time? What is the average resting heart rate? The answer is it varies depending on health, gender, genetics, weight, and so on. That's pretty useless for an SI unit, where things need to be absolute. Most people can easily estimate a second, so why over-complicate?\n\nWill you tell me that you want to simplify Avogadro's constant for molecular weights next because that number is stupid too? That number is 6.02214 x 10^23 mol^-1. Should we simplify that, and suddenly change all molecular weights for every element?",

            "Ah fair no worries. It's more even if the average is 60bpm, how can you measure that to get an accurate depiction of a second?\n\nFeet are as practical as meters but are just as arbitrary. Using your own feet to measure something would be extremely inaccurate. A foot is 12 inches, the average US foot size for men is 9-12, and 7-9 for women. So that's 0.859ft to 0.944ft for men, and 0.807ft to 0.859ft for women. That's about 90% accuracy for the average population, which is pretty bad. That's not a, 'your' problem. That's a problem with the unit itself. It's a bad unit of measurement if it makes sense for only those with a 13 US foot size. (Foot size is correlated to height, US 13 foot size correlates to those taller than 6'2\". Using this as an estimate, about 4% of the US population has this foot size. 96% of the population can't use this unit in the manner you describe accurately, which is pretty bad for a unit.)\n\nNo-one uses their feet to measure something. They will whip out a tape measure, at which point meters and feet are equally arbitrary. And dividing the distance light travels in a vacuum by 983571087.90472 to get 1 foot is even more convoluted. Meters simply exist because initially they were defined as what you said, 10,000,000th the distance from the north pole to the equator. It was the first attempt at standardisation and not bad for one. Feet never had this so, having just, a stick defined as a foot or yard was the most arbitrary one could get. The meter was then better defined, while the foot wasn't, and the rest is history. Since it's arbitrary, why change what most of the world uses now?\nEven the foot is defined by a division of a meter now since it's faster to do so, and the meter is already concrete.\n\nWhen doing chemistry it doesn't matter what you're multiplying a number by. So no whatever you use wouldn't be stupid. Changing every atomic weight to go in line with some new number you think up of just to make it nice and round would be though.\nThis isn't the point either, when is the last time you needed to divide light by 299,792,458 to measure something? The answer is never. Even those who manufacture rulers and measures don't need to. Only those who work in national measurement laboratories need to know this stuff. And as you just said, mols don't matter to you because you'll never have to estimate any amount of mols in your life.\nSo why does this?",
