        "content": "---\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n###Introduction\n\nDear readers old and new, welcome to /r/StupidFood.\n\nPlease take the time to have a look around and get to know the place.\n\n**History** : We have been here since spring 2015, although our slightly younger friends over at /r/WeWantPlates have thoroughly outgrown us. What started as a silly idea has morphed into a decent small sub that has regular influxes of subscribers whenever we get namechecked on /r/food or elsewhere. It is the brainchild of /u/Clackpot.\n\n**Content** : Feel free to post your own Stupid Food without worrying too much about quality, if it isn't good enough it'll drop off the front page and we'll all move on. There is no shame in unsuccessful posts.\n\n**Behaviour** : This sub is explicitly both partial and prejudiced, but nevertheless tolerance and consideration are required. Don't get too carried away. Insults and flaming are acceptable as long as they are creative, funny, imaginative, or otherwise thoughtful; but being shallow, boring, unoriginal, or derivative are cardinal sins.\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n\n\n###Our philosophy, and the elusive sidebar\n\nFrom time to time there has been some confusion about what exactly this sub is for. The sidebar explains it all in some detail.\n\nRemember, **/r/StupidFood does NOT try to be fair or impartial** in its efforts to poke fun. We will ridicule and scoff at whatever targets we choose, without first asking whether it is justified.\n\nBut many of you will be reading on mobile clients, blissfully unaware of our sub's sidebar and how that describes its ethos. Some of you may even be reading on desktop, *still* blissfully unaware of the sidebar, despite it being just over there ---->\n\nSo, **read the bloody sidebar!** On mobile you may need to click an icon such as an 'i' in a circle. In particular, pay  attention to this comment tucked away under the 'YOUR RIGHT TO TAKE OFFENCE' heading :-\n\n> ###/r/StupidFood is intended to be a somewhat puerile place to poke fun at other people's creativity, ***without regard to whether they deserve it***.\n\nThis is important! Do not expect the court of /r/StupidFood to be a just one. It is here to vent spleens and spout prejudices. It is not meant to be true or fair. It will cheerfully ignore the facts in pursuit of a cheap gag.\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n---\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n###Regarding moderation\n\nThis sub has a light-touch approach, preferring that most moderation be performed by subscribers voting items onto or off the front page.\n\n**Removal:** Items may be removed if they are wholly irrelevant, spam, grossly rude or inflammatory, or for any other reason the mods don't like. Posts which are merely low quality will not be removed.\n\n**Subreddit rules**: [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/StupidFood/about/rules/) will be added and amended as and when required. Please look at them.\n\n**Bans and suspensions:** May be dispensed for anyone with no interest in the sub's welfare; for crap bots; and anyone else failing to be part of the community. Other contributors will have to try *really* hard to earn themselves a suspension or even permanent ban. /r/StupidFood does not subscribe to big stick policing.\n\n**Overturning decisions:** We're not perfect, we'll get it wrong from time to time. Please [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FStupidFood) if you feel a decision is wrong or over the top and it will be reviewed.\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n---\n\n^(*/u/Clackpot*, last updated 30th October 2017)\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n\n",

            "PLEASE ban Rick Lax videos and others following his rage-bait formula! They very clearly fall under the \"spam\" category in the sub rules and I think it's pretty safe to say that everyone here is sick of that shit. \n\nIf you don't recognize the name Rick Lax, you will definitely recognize the formula. A model in yoga pants makes something gross, wasteful, and unsanitary in an LA mansion, while the person filming acts amazed and not at all disgusted. Remember that toilet ice cream cocktail video? That's the shit I'm talking about and it needs to stop.",

            "Lately there\u2019s been an influx of uninformed ppl submitting \u201cstupid cooking\u201d videos that turn out to have more cultural meaning than first glance. Can there be a way to tag those or something? A bit insulting to tag cultural cooking as stupid when OPs are just not informed.",
            "Can we revisit the Chefs Club topic? Perhaps if we are not open to banning the videos we could create a flair. It's oversaturating the sub and is intentionally making stupid food to gain traction.",

            "Okay so I'm new, but if I check out \"new\" it seems like most of the people posting here are r/lostredditors who should really be posting on r/shittyfoodporn.   Just because you made an anemic looking dish using processed ingredients doesn't mean your food is stupid, it's just bad.\n\nI'm cool with the hands-off approach to moderating (overmoderation ruins many humour subs), but wanted to check if this is the kind of thing that *technically* falls under the rule of \"missing the point\" of the sub, or just something that the sub is used to and decides to ignore since these posts will get downvoted anyways?  Basically, would reporting these just annoy people or should I be doing it when I see it?",
            "I have a suggestion (not sure if this is the right place): That posters be required to leave a \"starter comment\", in which they provide some context as to why their post belongs on \"Stupid Food\".\n\nI've noticed a lot of posts where the majority of comments are just people asking why something is stupid, with no cohesive answer, and I think holding OPs responsible for explaining why something is stupid would lead to higher quality posts and discussions.\n\nCheers!",

            "This subreddit has been 90% ragebait food wasting videos lately, we're basically just providing consistent free advertising for these god awful people to keep the cycle going.

I know the mod team is generally relaxed but how is this not weighing on your conciousness as someone who's merely viewing them? \n\nIt's not stupid food, it's stupid, talentless people wasting good food for views.",

The instructions said something about a sidebar, I am on mobile, I have not checked for the sidebar, last sentence I read was \u201cu/Clackpot last updated 30th October 2017\u201d.\n\nMy question is:\nWhat parameters are set around the word \u201cstupid\u201d? \n\nObviously, rage bait is an objectively stupid category of content, created by stupid people- and I\u2019d be happy to point out some examples of blatant rage/click bait food videos. Seems like the only valid submission. \n\nA person acting in good faith that makes a meal that is terrible looking, or who has a bizarre preference for food combos, but legitimately enjoys what they made- well, \u201cstupid\u201d feels a little mean to me.",

            "**Mod note:** No, we didn't ban them. But it does seem that the volumes have dipped off a bit, and also some individual examples got removed for various reasons IIRC.\n\nWhilst I loathe them as much as the next person, /r/StupidFood is not a vanity project for me or the wider mod team and we don't curate the sub or remove things that we personally find distasteful. Instead we leave submissions to live or die on their own merits, and the simple fact is that a lot of CC videos get a lot of attention and upvotes, so we leave them up.",

            "**Mod note:** We've been using a flair system for quite a number of months now, it isn't perfect but it's a great improvement over nothing at all. CC content is typically marked `ChefClub drivel`.\n\nI have no idea why you are not seeing flair, but I can assure that it is there.",
            "**Mod note:** Until very recently this thread was an archived post, meaning it was closed and you could neither vote nor comment on it. But then Reddit changed the rules and archived posts are open again.",
            "**Mod note:** The primary method of moderation at /r/StupidFood is users voting stuff onto and off of the front page, so if a post has zero upvotes by the time it gets reported then it is quite likely that I will leave it up unless it clearly doesn't belong, because having no karma effectively buries the post, whereas moderator removal actually makes it completely invisible unless you still have the original URL. \n\nGenerally we prefer to be tolerant and permissive so we don't actively go looking for things to remove, if they are harmless enough what's the point? And as it says right here in this post :-\n\n> Posts which are merely low quality will not be removed.\n\nHTH, and we always welcome the thoughts of our users.",

            "Please, I barely see any non rage bait posts unless I go search for them. People / bots keep reposting the same rage bait clips and it's ruining the whole point of the subreddit.",

            "If possible adding a rage bait flair would also help identify the things from like lily's page and other similar creators (they're still stupid and it's technically food, so it's not like it doesn't fit on here imo)",

            "Every post I was clicking in this sub lead me here earlier. Just checked again and it's working now so probably some temporary technological problem beyond my understanding. \n\nThanks for checking in though!",

On that occasion it just started working again after a short while.

Apparently it's a pretty old company that focused on bringing organic food from farmers to the people before it was cool, which was later bought out and turned into the mega-rich grocery store today. \n\nThe podcast host got the smoothie and said it was a 10/10, and after trying it myself, no tip (why tf would I do that), I gotta say it was one of the best smoothies I've ever had. Such a great flavor of strawberry and not too sweet. I actually talked to the host later that day about the smoothie at a book fair held at USC. \n\nAnd then I just walked around the store pretending I'm rich. It was interesting noting several details of the store gleaned from the podcast. There's like no signs above the aisles telling you what is where, so it feels in a way like a small treasure hunt at a thriftstore except you're finding 40 dollar ionized alkaline acidic organic crystal energy water. And also the aisles are really tall to block out the sound and envelop you almost, along with the beautiful arrangements of the fruit and vegetables. Also the checkout area has no conveyor belts and is quite open compared to the labyrinthine aisles behind, probably to reward the customer with human interaction afterwards. All of this is in the effort to make Erewhon an experience, not just a grocery store, which I guess appeals to the rich who want to feel special and shop somewhere with no proles. And by experience I mean psychological tricks like every grocery store does. \n\n\nNow, would I ever step foot in an erewhon again? FUCK NO, I'm a cheap ass in general, but I was in the area and I'll gladly spend money on LA experiences like these once in a while.",

            "Agreed! As far as I've seen though, Takis and whatever form of chips called \"fuego\" are mostly popular in the states, not so much south of the border. They taste too artificial and sweet with a kick for my liking. \n\nIf you want something good that'll get your taste buds sweating, try Chips Habanero. Those are good."

If you bake it, the moisture from the fresh mozzarella will separate. If you try and dry it out first, you've lost the point. \n\nJust a hunch as I've never tried... Consider making a burrata style filling with low moisture mozzarella and put that on the pizza. I think it'd be a combination of mozzarella, clotted or heavy cream, possibly some ricotta.",
