However, I've recently began looking at other vehicles due to my previous estimate being pushed back so far and have actually found a few that I like better, so this will probably be my last update to this post as I will likely end up canceling my order and going with an alternative.\n\nUpdate 5/8 - App now says 8/6-9/17. I stopped by the showroom on a whim to do another demo and the Tesla rep says my firm(er?) date is 7/5.\n\nUpdate 4/29 - Now 6/13-6/30. Was 6/11-6/30. It narrowed a bit and looks like it's probably going to be June for me.\n\n-----\u00a0\n\nFinally, a megathread. I ordered my white/white RWD on 3/5 and was originally given a May estimation. Two weeks later, that changed to 4/7 - 5/17. A week later, it said 5/17 - 6/21, and then a few days ago on Wednesday, it changed to 7/2 - 8/12. I was sad for most of the day and tried to convince myself to pick up a currently available black interior that I could customize the interior of somehow (can't think of any good ways) or switch to a white/white Model Y (I really want ventilated seats), but I couldn't. I still want my order, so I'm trying to reframe the delay as a birthday present instead, and keeping myself focused on other things so I won't check the app daily. Along with encouragement from my friends who are telling me if I'm going to spend this amount of money on a car, it should be for exactly what I want and how nice white/white looks, I've been able to deal with the news so far. I'll re-examine my options as the date gets closer and any potentially better options come up.",

So I've now been carless mooching off my friends and family for 4 months, and now Tesla expects me to wait another 4 months? \n\nIt's the not the wait im mad about, it's the lack of transparency. When I placed the order initially in early January, I was being told I was getting the car in February. If I was told August at the time, the order never would have been placed and thats a fact. I do not care about getting a Highland, I literally just wanted a new Tesla to replace the one that was lost. These ETA dates can't even be trusted at this point. Why would I wait for July-August only for them to push it out another 3 months towards the end of June? \n\nIf White Seats are this much of a problem to manufacturer, consumers NEED to be told about this before their orders are even placed. This is malpractice in the highest degree. I'm going to attempt to edit my order to black seats, as I've been told that should boost my delivery date.

I'm absolutely sure they could do a better job even considering how dynamic the situation is, but it's likely not a priority for them.

            "About two years ago, I tested the Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature on my Model 3 Performance (M3P) for the first time. At that point, it felt more like a novelty; I found it okay but not entirely trustworthy, as it was prone to errors and didn\u2019t seem very safe.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, my experience with FSD version 12 has been a complete turnaround. I've taken it on 8 to 12 drives, and it has performed exceptionally well in my case. Each journey required no intervention from me, except for a minor issue where it slightly missed my driveway upon returning home.\r  \n\r  \nI've been particularly impressed by its ability to handle complex scenarios, such as navigating around cars and trucks with trailers parked along unmarked roads. It also demonstrates advanced decision-making, like slowing down in the left lane to safely move behind a car when needing to make a right turn soon, among other notable maneuvers.\r  \n\r  \nThis progress excites me about the future of autonomous driving. I can envision a time in the next few years when human supervision might not be necessary, hoping that my 8-year-old will never need to learn to drive. The transition towards cars not being driven by humans promises a safer road environment for everyone.",
            "Tried FSD but its acceleration from red lights and stop signs are pretty aggressive, which is kind of annoying when it needs to aggressively slow down when I hit a red light. Is there a way to turn it down? \n\nI\u2019m already on the Chill mode setting for both my normal driving and the FSD profile.",
            "I was really looking forward to trying FSD, I planned to try it for a month when v12 came out. I already had EAP and I absolutely love it. It makes my commute a breeze and I hardly ever have any issues with it. Got my free month of FSD and the first day I tried it, it scraped a curb on a right turn. I should have disengaged and taken over, because I could tell it was taking the turn sharper than I would have liked, but I hesitated and payed the price only taking over after it already made impact. I also notice it rides the shoulder line like crazy. My EAP would keep me in the center of the lane at all times and worked flawlessly. My FSD has some weird favoritism to the right side of the road. All cameras are clear and I've cleaned them several times, but it keeps doing it. I also agree about the speeding up and slowing down. It seems to brake hard at red lights. Waiting until the last possible minute OR braking extremely early and then giving it some juice to get to the light instead of slowly rolling up to the stop. I've watched all the videos of people saying how human-like the experience is, but so far in my own use it hasn't felt that way yet.",
            "Am I the only one who thinks it\u2019s absolutely terrifying? I\u2019ve been using it for just a few days. Each time I\u2019ve used it, it\u2019s done something egregiously terrible.\n\n1. At roundabouts, it drives up to them at excessive speed, slams the brakes, then inches forward awkwardly. Then, it will enter the roundabout in the right lane but end up straddling the two lanes. In some cases, it will switch lanes midway so you exit in the wrong lane entirely.\n\n2. When in the right hand lane, in two different places in town, it signals right and starts moving into a merge lane that\u2019s ending in 100 meters or less.\n\n3. It accelerates with an odd vigour considering it\u2019s in chill mode.\n\n4. Approaching my house, which is on the left, it either signals right and goes into the right hand lane or it will stay in the same lane and blow past my place at full speed.\n\n5. On a few occasions, it has gotten extremely close to curbs.\n\n6. When the lane was ending on one of our bypass roads, it got right to the end and was not signalling or making any moves to the left so I had to take control. Not sure if it would have hit the guard rail or not.\n\n7. When turning left at an intersection with two left turn lanes, it always chooses to switch to the leftmost lane. Once it completes the turn, it ends up straddling the lanes instead of neatly putting itself in the leftmost lane.\n\nNow I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because winter is just ending here and our road lines are faded, or maybe it\u2019s just tuned to the layouts in certain big cities? I just don\u2019t understand how people can like this feature at all.",
            "Good experience so far with FSD on 2020 Model 3. My major gripes with it is all safety related such as being too hesitant at times to make the turn, stopping completely at stopsigns and having to press the accelerator bc it follows speed limits a lil too religiously. \n\nI will say I had 1 major error with FSD and it was when exiting a highway. Red steering wheel popped up telling me to take over and upon looking, the autosteer software rebooted itself due to a error, and the cameras also rebooted, causing FSD to fail. \n\nOverall, I really like the tech and excited to see FSD improve but i'm not spending $12k or $200/m for it... maybe $50/$100 a month for general use.",
            "Been trying it whenever I drive right now, and while it is impressive I would never pay for a feature this incomplete.\n\n1. It is absolutely terrible at left turns. It either refuses to go even when clear, or starts accelerating like it\u2019s going to jump out in front of a car that it definitely can\u2019t safely turn in front of. I just turn it off when making left turns now.\n2. It is terrible at any roundabout that has another car visible. It can handle single lane ones fine if they are empty, but it if any car is visible on the left at all then it just comes to a complete stop. I live next to the roundabout capital of the US, this is a constant problem.\n3. It is just barely more useful than regular Autopilot on the highway. I keep seeing defenders of FSD saying they NEED it for highway driving, but I have yet to see a scenario where it dramatically outperforms its free counterpart.\n\nIt\u2019s really cool. It\u2019s a neat party trick, and my kids think it\u2019s neat when I show them that the car is turning the wheel without mind. But I wouldn\u2019t pay $3k for it, much less $12k.",
            "I first bought it for $6k and then bought it again for another car at $15k. I really hate driving without it. It's nice that it's getting better at city roads, but highway driving is where it is more useful. Do I want it to drive me around town? Maybe, but taking over a bit of the work on the highway is where it is truly valuable to me.\n\nIt makes driving significantly less mentally taxing. You may think driving isn't that taxing, but you never realize how much it takes out of you until you don't have to focus on maintaining the lane or the distance between you and the next car.  It makes roadtrips a breeze.",
            "Gripes: Car accelerates too quickly from a stop, and brakes too hard when coming to a stop. On rural roads with a median area, the car hugs the left yellow line. It doesn't do this on the highway, however.\n\nOther than those couple of minor gripes, I am blown away with how well the car drives with FSD engaged. It took me to my destination 230 miles away with only a couple of interventions, which were mostly due to my lack of trust. It successfully navigated onto the Florida Turnpike, back off the Turnpike 200 miles later and onto another highway, back off the highway and through a construction zone with lanes marked only by cones, then drove the last 5 miles home on city streets before pulling up to the curb in front of my house.\n\nI've subscribed to FSD a couple of times in the past and was mostly terrified of the way it drove. The current FSD is so much better that I am almost more comfortable with it driving, even short distances, than I am with my own driving.",
            "Just tried it today. It immediately did something incredibly dangerous. On a long stretch of road that I\u2019m supposed to go straight, I see it go to the right turn lane, seeing it\u2019s a right turn only lane (the signs showed up in the dash), went straight and tried to illegally merge left in the intersection while there were cars to my left. I immediately stopped it in its path and turned right like how I\u2019m supposed to. It could\u2019ve caused an accident.",
            "I'm really trying to like FSD. The problem I'm having is that it won't stay in the right lane on the interstate. It wants to be at least one lane over to the left, but when I'm doing three over the speed limit and so many other cars are doing 10 or 15 over the speed limit, it's just not safe. Plus it makes me feel like a total dickwad. So despite having it available for free right now, I'm finding myself turning FSD off so I can use regular autopilot most of the time. If Tesla just makes it so the car will stay in the slow lane to avoid pissing off faster traffic, it would be far better. I understand why they do this, because they don't want to deal with merging so much. But in real life I deal with merging traffic all the time, and that's better than being stuck in the middle of traffic that's going way faster than me.",

            "All I\u2019ve learned is that TACC can in fact accelerate at a normal speed, but they just don\u2019t want to give us that luxury, constantly making us hit the pedal to speed up to the car in front of us. FSD does a great job at this, and the software as a whole is very impressive, but I\u2019d still never see why a person with a regular income would spend that amount of money on it.",

            "Got my 1 month FSD and honestly I just don't even use it. It corners too narrow and I feel it will scrape the wheels. \n\nIt also accelerates and decelerates unevenly and jarringly. \n\nIt gets confused at forks or roads that open up on a merge e.g. you turn right and there's a merge into the 2 lanes and it gets confused and just brakes hard or stops abruptly or just slowly waits and just gives up. \n\nHumans can turn heads and see what's there but this thing can't. Also sunlight causes issues and it thinks things are there when they aren't. \n\nOverall, FSD is truly impressive but also a bit scary honestly. I'm good with the tech improvements and this is how it has to come but it will take more time.",
            "My FSD trial ended today and I'm going to renew. I've been REALLY impressed with it over the last month. I really enjoy driving so going into the trial, I didn't think it's something that I'd actually end up using. So for me, the main benefit has been the reduction in driver fatigue when driving long distances: I'm still fully engaged with the road and environment while driving, but the decrease in mental load brought about by not having to actually manually steer has been noticeable; I do feel more energized at the end of long drives where I've used FSD. Overall, my experience has been positive.",
            "It handles downtown NYC traffic. Enuff said",
            "Biggest gripe is that it has no regard for speed bumps and takes \u2018em way harder than I would.",
            "Will regular autopilot be improved after my FSD trial runs out? In specific phantom breaking when a car takes a left turn hundreds of meters in front of you and clears the intersection and your car smashes the brakes even though the car is already long gone or when another lane opens up and it freaks the fuck out.",

            "I had a 3 month trial last summer with a M3 purchase.\nAfter 1 wk of V12 trial, its a big improvement in city driving where the V11 did not inspire confidence",
            "Decided to take my \"new\" (2019) car that has FSD on about 3 hour long trip and let it drive almost the entire way.  I noticed a few things:\n\n1. It doesn't seem to understand etiquette when merging.  The first disengagement was being in the left lane when right was merging and it wanted to speed up to go side-by-side with the guy in the right lane that needed to merge instead of slowing to let him in.  Second time, it tried merging while an impatient person was going 20 over the speed limit to pass me at the last second.  The car definitely had enough time to see the guy coming but didn't seem to care.\n2. It occasionally just slows down for no reason I can determine.  It's also very hesitant around turns.  I've had to override it with the pedal a lot.\n3. I don't seem to be able to just tell it to go 5 over the speed limit.  I tried the mode that goes with traffic but that was terrifyingly sporadic and did not have a (visible) set max speed and very obviously went above what I asked it to.  I turned that feature off real fast.  I don't want a ticket because my car decided to go 10 over the speed limit.  If anyone's got insight on how to have relative speed changes based on speed limit, I'd love to know.  Otherwise I guess I'm just stuck flicking the scroll wheel up every time the speed limit changes.  Not the worst thing.\n4. I had one critical disengage where it tried to turn onto a side road that added a concrete divider in the middle of the road.  Somehow it didn't see that (it has those cylindrical traffic cone things) and tried driving straight into it.  Good thing I knew that street well.\n5. It seems to stop late and accelerate too hard from stopping--and this is with chill mode and average behavior.  (I was not confident enough to use assertive behavior.)\n6. **Edit:** I just remembered this point in reading comments: It also for some reason hates to go into the right lane when a passing lane is created.  I will signal for it to turn right and it will start to move and cancel the signal then I signal again and it finally moves over.  I only had one time where it stayed right and that was because the lanes opened up to the left.  Unless there's a slow vehicle in front of me, it should be defaulting to getting in the right lane.",
            "Is it just me or was this FSD rollout perfectly timed for users all across the country chasing down the solar eclipse?  Think of all the data they\u2019re going to get about driving, supercharger usage, etc.",
            "FSD logic got dumber in few days\n\nI got free trial like many here. First few days, the logic was outstanding. \n\nLane changing (with traffic and exits), slowing down gracefully when coming to a signal &  sticking to set speed limits were amazing, I mean it was almost close to thinking like a human.\n\nNow in few days later, it\u2019s all messed up.

But I found out why she doesn't like it. I hope someone can help.\n\nIn FSD 12.3.6 I currently just have to single shift the stalk to engage FSD. I thought there was a way to make that a double shift (to engage FSD) so that a single shift engages just cruise control. She loves cruise control, hates FSD. Of course, she was very late to the smartphone market so I guess she'll be late piling on here, too. So, is there a way in FSD to make it a double shift enactment so that she can engage her precious cruise control with the single shift and I can have my FSD? TIA",

But I was very impressed at how well it handled the tough roads I threw at it this morning. I had one manual intervention, I was out in the country and doing about 50mph and a flock of turkeys was standing in the road. It didn't look like the car was going to stop (or stop in time) so I took over. I came across one earlier at a slower speed and the car stopped and eventually went around it.\n\nOther than that it did well. It likes to hug the inside line more than I would like on long left turns though. It's aware it's doing it because when a car was coming the other direction it moved over to the right in the lane. On a narrow winding 1.5 lane street I would want it to give more room on the right for parked cars. It doesn't have a problem driving outside of the lane in that situation.\n\nOnce it was a little confused about which lane to be in, it's a weird setup though for the highway entrance. It wanted to get over early (which you can) but it corrected itself and then changed into the lane 200ft later.\n\nIt looks like the stop sign/light issue was fixed, the car started to slow ahead of time and came to a stop like a normal driver would.\n\nThere was a right turn from a back residential road onto a high speed two lane road, you have to be careful and get up to speed quickly. The car came to a stop, crept forward, I saw a car coming up on us quickly (wasn't sure if it was gonna try and make it or wait). The Tesla waited for the car to pass and then very confidently turned and accelerated hard to get up to speed. Im impressed!",

            "I took my kid to a Pizza Hut Classic, a trip from Austin to Bastrop about 35 minutes away. This trip is mostly highway, followed by country roads.\n\nOverall, it was a smooth experience, punctuated by moments of dangerous confusion.\n\nI want to classify these into two parts: things I consider mapping issues and those that are part of FSD itself. From what I can tell, these are two totally different systems, and how they communicate seems more like a recommendation than real navigation.\n\nNavigation Issues:\n\n- On a 75 mph toll highway, it decided the speed was 55, likely because the frontage road had a sign for 55 mph. It seems random whether it pays attention to these signs.\n\n- Once at the destination, it got off at the correct exit where we needed to make a U-turn ahead, but it somehow got lost, maybe due to a GPS issue. It ended up getting back on the highway, where the navigation told it to turn around at places that didn\u2019t exist. Eventually, it found a real exit and turned around fine.\n\nFSD Issues:\n\n- On the country road, there were flashing yellow lights at an intersection, which just means \u201cbe aware,\u201d but FSD decided to slow way down. I had to correct that. On the drive back, it didn\u2019t slow down there, probably because we were in thicker traffic and it was just following the flow.\n\n- On the same road, a car trying to merge got into the shoulder to sneak in. FSD thought it was about to jump into our lane and braked hard. I had to put my foot down to prevent an issue.\n\n- Later on, I nearly got into an accident. It wasn\u2019t FSD\u2019s fault; it was the other driver who decided to get onto the highway going 30 mph while everyone else was doing 75, then cut in front of me. I had to swerve into the left lane to avoid them, thank God there was no one there. I mention this because I think if I was driving, my brain would have been more alert and seen that this person was likely going to do something stupid. I\u2019m much better at reading what other cars are going to do. While in FSD, I just sort of space out looking ahead.",

It's this way even if there's no other cars in sight so it's not like it's anticipating another pass.  I eventually have to manually turn on the turn signal to get it back into the right lane.",

Keep in mind here on a road of 80 km/h or less, it's legal to pass on the right, but it's illegal to change lanes to the right in order to pass a vehicle, then immediately return to the left lane so this could be an illegal lane change.\n\n[https://imgur.com/da5EWP4](https://imgur.com/da5EWP4)\n\nThird one is how it handled a minibus doing a U-turn at an intersection I was turning to and how it passed it later on. I liked that it gave it room to make its U-turn, didn't freak out for it being in front of it and didn't try to 'squeeze in' when it backed up.\n\n[https://imgur.com/OWqtmAD](https://imgur.com/OWqtmAD)\n\nLast one is an edited one since it was over one minute long. It shows how the car reacted to traffic work on the right lane with cars waiting to turn left in the opposite direction, Then it cut to the black SUV turning left, with my car doing the legal maneuver this time by taking the right lane to pass him. Finally, the third section is the car missing its left turn arrow, wait for its turn then slow down to let the pedestrian pass before finishing its turn.\n\n[https://imgur.com/YgVK4yh](https://imgur.com/YgVK4yh)\n\nAll in all, my disengagement were just for better route planning than the car had took, nothing that would have ended up in an accident if I didn't intervene.

It may not drive exactly like you do, but it does an amazing job.  The only criticism I have is that it does come close to some curbs when turning right. I will say it never hit a curb, just came close.  I love how it warns you and even tells you the reason for lane changes.

Pretty cool.\n* With most software limitations getting out of the way, it's becoming clear what the hardware limitations are. Those cameras do not work as well as our eyes with sun in front of the vehicle, or at night, or in the rain. I don't think that any of the current cars will ever become a Level 4 or Level 5 self-driving car.\n* I had two interventions. Not because it was doing something wrong, but because it wouldn't give me enough time to react if it did. I couldn't bet on it. (One example: a car incorrectly turned right on a red light when it was green for me).\n* Liability is a problem. With the car driving itself without your brain being linked to the car's brain (yet), the car reacts much quicker to red lights and other stuff. I believe that the principle of \"supervising\" a self-driving car is flawed. Your brain will not be able to quickly react to what's happening + what the car is trying to do because of it on many cases. That's not how the amygdala in your brain works. You really need to be able to trust that it will do better than you would.\n\nStill, what an achievement.",

No one really knows how good this is outside of Tesla owners. They all still think it\u2019s dumb autopilot. I\u2019ve impressed so many people.\n\nIt could use some better indicators, and options while driving like to yield to another driver",

Wow, was I mistaken - it has worked beautifully! So far, it's only made one mistake (it got in the wrong lane for a tunnel). It's handled curves, on/off ramps, stoplights, etc. perfectly. I (and my wife especially!) wishes (1) it didn't accelerate so aggressively from red lights and (2) that it would anticipate red lights and slow down sooner and more smoothly.  I like it best in heavy traffic on surface streets. My biggest complaints are that (as far as I can tell) it can't identify speed bumps or potholes. Also - and this really irritates me - half the time on surface streets with more than one lane in each direction, it wants to get out of my preferred lane. Turning off the turn signal doesn't do anything (except probably annoy the hell out of the people behind me!).\n\nIt's definitely more than a parlour trick, but I wouldn't pay $100 regularly to use it - my commute just isn't all that difficult, and until it really is autonomous, it's not actually giving me back any time.

It didn't react fast enough on the lane change and I had to take over so we would make the exit.\n\nSecond one was in the city.  Lots of traffic on a major interstate - backed up and moving slow.  We were merging from left to right with another interstate merging from right to left.  We were running out of room as our lane ended early due to some construction.  Car was totally confused and stopped.  I had to coax it to go and complete the merge.\n\nAnother note... In the city, we have tons of potholes.  I am very familiar with the road we were travelling, and I hit the left signal to get us in a clear left lane.  I'm new to this, so I thought the car would do what I was supervising it to do.  It didn't.  The car ignored my suggestion, and proceeded to keep us going.  It didn't miss the pothole I wanted us to avoid and I got some minor damage on my front passenger bumper.

            "No problem! For a little context I used EAP significantly. I drive with it on my 39mi (45min) commute probably 4 days a week. I also took a trip from southern PA down to Camden SC using EAP for the majority of the trip. It's also important to note that EAP and FSD use different software (I believe). I think EAP is still using code where FSD is using the AI approach, because they act very differently. With that said, FSD has improved my commute but only slightly. It has definitely fixed minor annoyances that I had with EAP. \n\nIn my particular stretch of the interstate there are several on ramps where the broken lines end before the lane fully merges onto the highway. With EAP's tendency to always keep me in the center of the lane, it would slightly merge to the right when I would pass one of these spots. Afterward it would merge back. It wasn't drastic, but it was noticeable maybe moving a foot or two to the right then back at these spots. FSD doesn't do this at all, it stays completely in the lane at all times.\n\nThe other minor annoyance I had with EAP was taking exit ramps. EAP is supposed to take you off at the exit and put you back in control at the end of the ramp. This works hit or miss depending on the ramp. The exit I use for work splits into two lanes and it confuses EAP, making me take over before I get to the light. FSD handles exits flawlessly.\n\nSo, it has actually improved things for my commute and I haven't seen any negatives using FSD over EAP for interstate driving. In my experience the changes are minor though and I would be fine using either EAP or FSD for my commute. Although it is nice to have the entire drive handled via autopilot vs just the highway travel.\n\nAdditionally, I will give FSD some credit now that I've had a chance to use it more. I have been using it a few times a week to take me to work and back. It has done some really impressive things through normal driving that do feel very safe, controlled, and human-like. However, I still hold my breath on some turns, and there's a few that I won't let it even attempt. When they fix the curbing issue, I would consider the upgrade for myself. Hope that helps and answers your questions. If you have more feel free to ask!",
            "Yeah, the first time I disengaged, thinking it would take the ditch lol. It also do not indicate that it's merging onto the highway, as if it takes the lane only because his is ending and it follows the right painted line.",

I\u2019ve been wanting a Tesla for quite sometime and it just seemed like perfect timing. Got a smoking deal almost as if I stole it lol. I do like the look of the new design but it didn\u2019t stand out to me as the same car I\u2019ve been wanting for years. As far as pros and cons I see the staggered wheel set as a con because let\u2019s be really the teslas go through tires fast because of that instantaneous torque. I want to get as much life as I can out of them by being able to rotate them. I do not track the car, so the staggered wheels wouldn\u2019t give me any noticeable performance boost. The buttons for the blinkers are also another con. Just something about being in a turn already and have to use my blinker coming out of the corner. I\u2019d have to make sure I\u2019m hitting the right button which might be hard with the wheel upside down. I do like the seats in the new one better. They seem to have great lumbar support. The suspension is also an upgrade. The range has been lowered by 20 miles for a .2 second lower 0-60mph time. Not a big deal. I got my car for about $10k less than the new one is now so for cost the old one had an advantage. The fog lights imo are a necessity. I live near the ocean and it is foggy a lot here. Also I\u2019m more of a fan of the shape of the headlights on the older model. It reminds me a lot of Porsches design. The new headlight looks like it\u2019s something that was taken off a Mazda.

            "I can\u2019t make up my mind on the refresh. I like the rear. The side is exactly the same. But the front looks a bit underwhelming. At first I liked how it looked lower to the ground and a bit more sporty, but the more I look at it, the more I think it makes the profile look too bubbly and overall makes the car appear much smaller akin to a compact sedan.",
            "My opinion too but we seem to be the minority",
            "The older look has better balance between the front and bulbous back.",
            "It doesn\u2019t look better and also has a worse speaker system, worse suspension, worse motor, worse cameras, a worse onboard computer\u2026",
            "Hell yeah. The refresh front is so plain it has no attitude and no character. The rear is off a Polestar so that ain't any better either.",
            "2021 , right after the refresh",

            "Hahah yeah just a small modification on my end that also contributed to 0.0001% of the aerodynamics ;)",
            "So that's a good thing for consumers in the used market.\n\nI can't wait in a year or 2 this refresh model is going to be 25k.",
            "It really depends I\u2019d say. The new one feels much like a big \u201crefinement\u201d over say a \u201cnew model\u201d. Lots of quality of life improvements, and general feeling of more thought through design. \n\nAn example, that I feel is pretty obscure but noticeable is the actuation motors on the folding mirrors and charging flap. It sounds more deep and premium over the previous model, which doesn\u2019t really matter, but subconsciously adds to the feel that you\u2019re interacting with a higher end product than the previous model.\n\nAlso I hated that my 2021 only had 1 reverse light on one side (only EU models have this I believe), and puny little indicator lights. Well solved in the new one.",
            "I feel the model 3 is more refined at this point. I love the model S, but I think that it\u2019ll take one more refresh cycle to get it to that sweet spot of design and refinement (which is likely to come soon)",

            "That\u2019s for sure! I\u2019ve always loved cars and all of the car groups I\u2019m in talk smack about Teslas every chance they get. However, it\u2019s usually the people who can\u2019t spell, which might tell you something. \ud83d\ude05",
            "How so?",
            "I have to say the turn signals are actually buttons, not some fake response crap like in the X and S. I could get use to them and that is saying a lot.",
            "lol",
            "No fog lights :(",
            "Maybe that's the part I like about the old model, more rounded and bulbous.",
