            "Been runnin' hot for a minute. Regression is sure to hit me sooner or later - here's to hoping later.\n\nHad my best ever Tapology finish (2nd out of over 5,000) a few weeks ago for the [Cannonier/Imavov card](https://www.tapology.com/ue/111458-4166363.png) - only miss on that minefield was my dumbass Moises selection (yeah, I know - Tomar got a gift from the judges).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sf9xod2zxk7d1.png?width=1836&format=png&auto=webp&s=71182700e4fd652c2a6a6516f6c2709fb7e1be44\n\n|Pick|Units\\*|Odds|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Ikram Aliskerov|1.50|+122|\n|Johnny Walker|1.00|-118|\n|Filipe Lima|0.50|+110|\n|S. Pavlovich + T. Aspinall|3.75|+129|\n|~~R. Fakhretdinov + S. Magomedov~~|~~1.00~~|~~-105~~|\n\n*\\*Units are rounded for simplicity. I prefer to risk an amount to win units in 0.25 increments (ex. I'm risking $388 to win $500 on Pavlovich/Aspinall but rounded it to 3.75 units risked)*\n\n**BEWARE**\n\nI didn't realize Pavlovich trains with Volkov when I placed this bet on May 16th.\n\nThis is sketchy because if you watch Pavlovich's fight vs. his training partner Mikhail Mokhnatkin in 2017, this is a eerily similar situation. The result? The two training partners threw pillows for 25 minutes in a super boring championship fight.\n\nOn the plus side, Pavlovich showed he can go 5 rounds (just kidding, they literally sparred for 25 minutes...). I will be watching the interviews over the next two days very closely.\n\nI can't imagine they would have a gentlemen's agreement to fucking SPAR in the UFC with both being so close to title contention - but you never know with these Russians.\n\nOnly prop I will consider touching is over 1.5, over 2.5 and fight goes to decision - but this is hinged on the upcoming interviews.\n\nI've got just over 25 units on the line between this weekend and UFC 304 - This is going to be a long stretch of 6 weeks but I'm feeling good about it. Still targeting 50 units profit for 2024.\n\nGood luck my degenerate brothers!\n\n**Edit 06/21/24 11:20 PM EST:** \n\n1. Removed Fakhretdinov/Magomedov parlay due to Magomedov being re-booked\n2. Increased stake on Ikram Aliskerov",
            "Aliskerov being a short dog, doesn't have 5rd experience, huge step up in competition, inflated price considering his name this setup kinda reminds me of the Buckley-Ruziboev fight a few weeks ago.  Whittaker's durability is mostly faded, but I'm skeptical of Aliskerov's finishing ability at the world class level, gotta lean favorite",
            "There\u2019s a new Dagestani in town\u2026 Ikram w incoming \ud83d\udc4a",
            "[Pavlovich/Volkov exchange (roughly) translated:](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nKRhDi0x4c8)\n\n* **Volkov:** \u201cWhy did you say that I was the first to agree to the fight?\u201d\n* **Pavlovich:** \u201cWell, you yourself said right away that you would fight.\u201d\n* **Dana White:** \"Thanks guys, everyone\"\n* **Volkov:** \u201cNo, no, no. You said that if I fight, you will fight too. Is this a refusal?\n* **Pavlovich nods his head**\n* **Volkov:** \u201cYou didn\u2019t say that you wouldn\u2019t fight.\u201d\n* **Pavlovich:** \u201cAli said...\u201d \\*further unintelligible\n* **Dana White:** \"I have no idea what you're talking about, good luck tomorrow\"\n* **Volkov:** \u201cAli told me when you already said that you would fight.\u201d\n\nEdit: I don't think Volkov is too excited about this affair",
            "Anyone whose followed the UFC for long enough seen a Volkov VS Pavlovich situation before?\n\nTwo good friends and sparring partners who don\u2019t want to fight each other? IIRC they even said they didn\u2019t want to take the fight because they were so close.\n\nDo these fights end up being low volume decisions? Or do they end quick because they just want to get out of there?",
            "If you can\u2019t wait for Fight Night, PFL has a decent card tomorrow. Rob Wilkinson + Impa now going off at almost even money after Impa\u2019s odds dropped considerably.\n\nPFL card is at elevation in Salt Lake, so beware fighters with tank concerns.",

WOOF\u2026WOOF WOOF\u2026WOOF WOOF.\n\n__Aliskerov +130 1u +115 4u__  (had Bobby Knucks at +210 vs Chimaev but give me the +115 on Aliskerov. I worry about Rob\u2019s ability to protect his jaw for 5 rounds, or 1 round, really. I do not think Ikram will be lulled into a point fight. He\u2019s going to let the dogs out on Rob, who has become a world-class round-edger but is vulnerable when things go off-script. A last second switch to five rounds vs elite competition is a huge ask but I think Aliskerov has the talent to do it).\n\n__Volkov +165 0.5u +190 0.5u__ (Pav probably finds the early finish but if that doesn\u2019t happen I think Volkov\u2019s live.

And Ikram has serious power behind his strikes even when throwing 70%.\n\nTouch for Ikram because of the 14+ day weight cut & the insane amount of travel. Finally, preparing for quite possibility the easiest fight of his career in Trocoli which in all likelihood would have lasted less than half a round then being shifted to a potential 5 round war with what will be his 2nd toughest opponent in his career. \n\nIf Ikram was scheduled to fight Bobby from the jump (i.e. removing the 2 week weight cut and last minute acclimation), I seriously believe this would be a pick'em at a minimum - if not Ikram being lined around -130. \n\nIkram has the quicker path to victory via finishing him in the 1st 10 minutes. Whereas I do not see Robert finishing anyone in the top 10 inside the distance.\n\nOn the other side, if this fight doesn't end within the 1st 2 rounds, Ikram is in serious trouble. Not because he doesn't have a gas tank - His cardio isn't terrible but was visibly worn out in both his last two fights then entered the 3rd round. But because of the aforementioned weight cutting and travelling. \n\nWhittaker's Advantages: Better cardio, far more acclimated, prepared for a 5 round war, moderately quicker striker\n\nIkram's Advantages: Superior wrestling, superior grappling, absurd power for middleweight\n\nNow for my hot take...\n\nI love Whittaker, I do. From his days at welterweight (if you didn't know, he started his career at 170) I've been a fan of his. He has beaten everyone he was supposed to beat with exception to DDP. But middlewieght really isn't deep in elite talent. As such, I struggle being impressed with his resume of wins. In order of skill, his last 5 wins are: Gastelum, Cannonier, Vettori, Till, Costa. Hot take: Whittaker is a medium fish in a small pond.\n\nAfter actually writing all this (which I didn't intend to draft a fucking novel), I found myself compelled to increase my stake on Ikram.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0rrwjvt1aq7d1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9a40a0fd7f8a9bc78633cb1df2343153e586ffc\n\nWith no risk, there is no reward.

One additional point is that Rob looked washed against DDP, it's true he was having some success in that match-up but the way in which his chin crumbled (essentially from a DDP jab I just re-watched it) was shocking to me. I think Ikram could finish Rob in the first 3 rounds. If he doesn't it could go to a close decision. I think you are right that if both fighters had equal time to prepare Ikram would be a favorite but the additional weight cut and long distance travel could be detrimental here. From a betting perspective there are too many unknowns so I will watch live and bet if I see an opening.

He was also already scheduled to fight Costa, Imavov, and Fluffy before, so the UFC knows he\u2019s good and has high hopes for him. \n\nI think Ikram\u2019s easily one of the best fighters in middleweight, and the world\u2019s about to find out.",

Levels to this shit style.\n\nFinishing Phil Hawes, Warley Alves, and mario sousa, doesn't impress me, like not even a little. Not even close.\n\nThat's like saying you should be impressed with beating tony ferguson in 2024.

            "I see it the same way. I\u2019ve got Whittaker late finish props as a hedge. Aliskerov\u2019s 5 round cardio is a major question. Fight will come down to Rob\u2019s fragile chin vs Ikram\u2019s ability to maintain pace for 25. I think Ikram catches him, though, especially if he comes out a little recklessly and forces Rob off-script.",
            "I mean rob does sometimes like to mix in takedowns to keep opponents guessing, izzy whittaker 2, gastelum, till, etc. He was even panic shooting on romero every time romero rocked him. He's not going to have any success wrestling ikram thats for sure. Of course prime romero would flatline ikram. Anyways, i see it 60/40 whittaker. This is like a steve erceg alexandre pantoja fight, even if ikram is the better fighter, he's too young, too inexperienced, too short notice, and no 5 round experience, to face someone as talented and well rounded as whittaker who has proven to be a consistent minute to minute winner, and is well versed and well suited against nearly all styles.\n\nIn short too much too soon, if they fought in 2 years, ikram would flatline him i'm sure.",
            "I agree with most of that, but Rob was finished by a DDP jab and was saved by the bell against Costa. He\u2019s really vulnerable these days against big hitters who are willing to break out of the point fight style Rob wants to impose.\n\nBut he is also rightly favored here. Going five against Rob on short notice in your fourth fight is a huge ask."

Also the support they have in Germany is incredible as there is many Turks living in Germany which can be a huge uplift for Turkey.\n\nI think we\u2019ll see goals from both sides, and that we\u2019ll see an entertaining game at one of my favourite stadiums Signal Iduna Park.\n\nBOL",

Moving onto the most attackable game today IMO where we should see plenty of points and decent weather compared to Sydney....\n\n**Event:** Gold Coast Titans vs NZ Warriors \n\n**Time:** 3:00 PM AEST 22/06 \n\n**Bookie**: Ladbrokes\n\n**Play:** Anytime Tryscorer, Montoya \n\n**Odds**: $1.94 (AUS) or -105 (US) \n\n**Units:** 1.25 Units \n\n**Analysis:** This is a pure stats play here and if you\u2019ve been around this group long enough, you probably know where this is going. Titans were completely woeful last week, beyond bad and to lose to the Tigers\u2026.. Shameful honestly. They get a nice inclusion and if there was any shining light out of that game, Kini looks a solid prospect in fullback. They get David Fifita back in for this match, big in for them. Warriors coming in with a weird loss to a good Melbourne team where they really put it on them - for 30 mins, then folded. They lose DWZ, Berry, Barnett and Capewell which are all good players but their main backline and forward pack stays relatively intact in key positions. This really comes down to historical stats for me. Titans are just a bag of shit, excuse the french, in terms of their middle defence where they\u2019ve allowed 30 tries through their middle so far this season. Can you guess where Warriors are ranked 2nd overall in terms of the offence and have scored 28 tries so far this year? You guessed it, their middle. AFB has been on fire in terms of tries for a front rower this year, scoring 6 tries in 2024 so far and while I don\u2019t love the idea of consistently backing a front rower for tries. With an area of success this big and an area of weakness that wide, you kind of have to go back to the well at the price. AFB scored last time these two faced each other earlier in the year and I genuinely think if the Warriors are smart and continue their trends, they\u2019ll have him running second off the ball close to the line and hit him through a gap. Titans are weak as piss on their line specifically centrally in defence and you\u2019re not stopping a guy like AFB that close with that mentality. Jojo Fifita out on the right wing, expecting Te Maire Martin to really keep developing this left edge as they have scored over 42% of their tries in the last few weeks with Johnston out. I think with Titans right edge missing Jojo and the Warriors missing DWZ on their right, think the left could be very fruitful today. Pompey been in good form also and if they have early success there, expect them to continue attacking that edge. 1.94 for a Warriors winger against a dreadful Titans defence is absolute juice IMO. Montoya been in relatively good form with 3 tries in 4 games and a double in his last match against the Storm. With a stunted backline of the Titans and a late out of Fifita, DWZ out on the right, I think the Warriors left edge might be on today and given how BAD the weather is in Sydney, feel like this is the match to attack today. Getting this price on a consistent Warriors winger who can finish, IMO this should closer to 1.50-1.60. I think it's the best play today! GL\n\n**LET ME KNOW IF YOU'RE TAILING.

Even his bad splits are better than most pitchers good splits.\u00a0 He is always available, pitching 180+ innings the last two seasons while maintaining a sub 4 ERA and this season through 98 innings has a sub 3 ERA and is on pace for 200+ innings.\u00a0 Righties OPS .629 and Lefties OPS .537 against Gilbert.\u00a0 2 of the top 4 offensive producers bat from the left side for the Marlins in Jazz and Jesus Sanchez, so outside of De La Cruz and Josh Bell, Gilbert should be able to work his way through this lineup without much push back.\u00a0 In June, Gilbert has thrown 21 & 2/3 with only 4 earned runs.\u00a0 I mean c\u2019mon.  \n  \nSeattle\u2019s offense is usually nothing to write home about, but for what it\u2019s worth, they have brought themselves back up to a more palpable .735 OPS over the last week compared to their .670 season average.\u00a0 The Marlins will most likely run out a slew of arms in a bullpen game, so there is no judging what the offense will truly face from a matchup perspective.\u00a0 What I do know is that some homie named Shaun Anderson is getting the ball first and he has a negative career WAR and a flat 6 ERA in 141 career innings.\u00a0 They do not want to be fighting to avoid the sweep on Sunday.\u00a0 So sign me up for a Mariners bounce back to tie the series up.\n\nCheerz,  \nKBC",

Let's keep it rolling.\n\n**Pick: New York Yankees F5 ML -140 (MLB, 1u bet)**\n\nThe Yankees are coming off an 8-1 loss to the Braves on Friday, but I like them to bounce back today. New York has been good at home all year, and over the last month they are 3rd in batting average and 1st in both OPS and wRC+ against right handed pitching. They've also had success against Charlie Morton, as the current lineup is batting .310 with a .922 OPS across 166 plate appearances. Soto in particular has feasted in this matchup with 7 hits, 3 home runs, and 5 walks in 16 plate appearances. On the other side, Atlanta ranks bottom 10 in the same metrics over the last month and when you look at road games, they rank dead last in all 3. Now the lineup does have decent numbers against Stroman, batting .299 with a .737 OPS in 69 plate appearances, but Stroman is good at inducing ground balls so I still think the New York offense has the advantage here, and we get the push protection even if it is a little juiced.

They're gonna have real problems containing Souths left edge because Schoupp and Saab are terrible defensively but Souths won't be able to match their speed on the edges either.

This bet is either going to look like genius or age like a festering POS in my comment history. But I\u2019ve been thinking about it all week and for me it\u2019s the best bet on tomorrow\u2019s Saudi Arabia UFC card. What do I like so much about this line and this bet in particular:\n\n* Volkov and Pavlovich were previously training partners and as such they will be intimately familiar with each other's style, strengths and weaknesses (I don\u2019t think the line is really accounting for this)\n* All 6 of Pavlovich\u2019s UFC wins are by KO/TKO in round 1 in the UFC so an obvious hedge for this bet is KO/TKO in Round 1 for Pavlo, which is plus money right now (+150) - Pavlovich is 6-2 in the UFC whilst Volkov is 11-4\n* Both fighters are strikers with Pavlovic having attempted no takedowns so I have to assume this fight will take place on the feet. On the feet I give the advantage to Volkov in most aspects except raw power. Volkov has great kicks and accurate punches with decent power - he has finished 6 of his 11 wins by KO/TKO. The movement of both fighters leaves somewhat to be desired - they are both plodding with limited lateral and head movement.\n* Pavlovich seems one dimensional to me he just plods around not doing a lot and then explodes into life in reckless fashion often catching his low-level opponents and knocking them out - his record is full of low level guys except Curtis Blades who decided to strike with Pavlo despite being a wrestler (go figure).\n* Could one of Pavlo\u2019s reckless stray punches find the chin of Volkov? Yes of course, and if it does, it will be lights out. But the odds are not reflecting the way this likely plays out\u00a0**if this goes beyond round 1,**\u00a0which I think there is a decent chance it will because Volkov knows Pavlovich and his movement patterns from sparring.\n* I watched Pavolvich\u2019s last fight that reached the 2nd round - you have to go way back to 2017 (!) when he faced Mikhail Mokhnatkin in a unanimous\u00a0decision win - it was very boring: Pavlovich was low output and one dimensional although he did land a takedown in round 5 but didn't keep his opponent down.\n* Volkov has almost 2.5 times as many MMA fights as Pavlovich (47 vs 20 fights)- that is a crazy amount of experience to draw on in order to avoid that first round KO power.\n* Volkov hasn\u2019t been KO\u2019ed since 2018 and it was a wild last-second stoppage by Derrick Lewis in a fight that Volkov was dominating, prior to that he has only one other KO loss on his record back in 2013 when he was in Bellator and he looked considerably skinnier (he weighed in at 235 for that fight vs 258 today)\n* Volkov is on a 3-fight finish streak whereas Pavlo just suffered his first loss in the UFC in humbling fashion to interim champ Aspinall and we have seen in the past that fighters who get beaten badly sometimes approach their next fight tentatively (see Ngannou vs Lewis after Ngannou was humbled by Miocic)\n* Lastly and of least importance since it's just a sentiment of mine: Earlier in the week Volkov gave an interview where he said he doesn\u2019t remember sparring with Pavlovich only waking up in the locker room afterwards and he also made other funny comments like \u2018just thinking about the fight is making me nervous\u2019 and \u2018I will just try to survive\u2019 - seems to me he is stoking the narrative that he has no chance against this murderous power puncher, which shows that he is astutely aware of what the narrative is. For me it highlights the keen intellect of Volkov - I think he clearly understands the risks that Pavlo poses and will have game planned accordingly.\u00a0Expect him to keep distance in round 1 with lots of teep kick and chopping low kicks, he won't hang around in the pocket.\n\nIf you decide to tail only bet what you can afford to lose and\u00a0**consider the Rd1/Rd2 KO/TKO props**\u00a0(you can even take these props\u00a0**without specifying a fighter**\u00a0so can take double profit if Volkov gets the finish - for instance betting a round 2 KO/TKO for either fighter is currently +600 which I think is great value).

The turnaround has largely been a product of their lineup finally hitting: they're 7th in wRC+ since June 1st and top 10 in wOBA. In the last 2 weeks they're at a 131 wRC+ and .349 wOBA and averaging 6.8 runs in their last 10 compared to 4.7 on the season. Their bullpen has also done a 180 since the beginning of this month, ranking 5th in xFIP.\n\nThe Cubs on the other hand, still haven't found a way to get their offense churning. They're not bottom of the league bad, but they still have been pretty average to below average this month with a .306 wOBA and 98 wRC+ since June 1st. Jameson Taillon gets the start for CHC today, and similar to the handicap yesterday where Dylan Cease had a great outing against the Brewers the first time, Taillon had the same against the Mets in his prior appearance, going 7.1 innings and allowing just 1 ER. But that was back in April and as I noted above, the Mets lineup has improved since (also getting J.D. Martinez has been a welcome addition to help add power as well).\n\nMets are good against RHP (albeit not as good as against LHP) and they also hit much better away from Citi Field (.295 wOBA at home vs. .342 wOBA away). Has been some movement in the direction of the Mets already so I'm taking this number at close to even money and banking for the team to expose Taillon the second time they see him (Mets starter Tylor Megill is fine btw...not great but 3.82 xFIP on the season still is slightly above league average).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ibnxe8uk48d1.png?width=789&format=png&auto=webp&s=c613dce144f483b6f9f1f046fe05356e47920919",

Love to see that! We keep moving!\n\n**Write up:**\u00a0Last time Eflin saw the Pirates was March 2023, he had 10 strikeouts against 23 batters. Pirates at home against right handed pitchers, they strikeout 24.6%, 6th worst in the league. Overall against right handed pitchers, they strikeout 25%, 5th worst in the league. In the last 20 starts, Eflin averages 5.2 innings and faces, on average, 23.2 batters. At a strikeout rate of 24.6%, he would need to face at least 20 batters. So unless something is really off, if he continues to see 23 batters, we should see at least 5 strikeouts from Eflin. \n\n**Tracker:**\u00a0[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PW7Xm9H6RaNyDg-kDsPnIIWy6mPYgqQNCoApdqPd1lM/edit#gid=1678861616](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PW7Xm9H6RaNyDg-kDsPnIIWy6mPYgqQNCoApdqPd1lM/edit#gid=1678861616)",
