If you want help planning your trip, you need to provide us specific information about you. We all love to have fun, see cool things and eat food. That is not specific detail. You will get more help and better help if you can be specific. \n\nGreat posts that have gotten lots of good information include specific details about what people are fans of and the kinds of things they like to do. If you\u2019re looking for meals or experiences, please provide a budget in actual numerical dollars. \u201cCheap\u201d or \u201c$$\u201d is subjective. Tell us the dollar amount you want to spend per person. \n\nBy way of example: saying you like a good bar is not helpful, but saying you're a huge fan of negronis and would love to try New York City's best is. But you could also say that your idea of a great bar is an old wooden place with gruff bartenders and its own local beers, and you're really looking to stay in Manhattan - that's also specific enough that we can help. \n\nIf you have an itinerary or rough sketch of one already and need help finding a few last pieces - we are great at that! If you have no idea where to start, Google \"NYC itinerary for X days\", try ChatGPT, or search this subreddit - but don't just come and post your ChatGPT spit out here. You need to do your own work a bit and then come ask for advice.\n\nWe really do want to assist you, but it's pretty rude to just post \"we are coming next week and we are [ages], we like food and fun, plan our trip for us!\"",

Some people just aren't very smart or that's their only coping skill or only form of entertainment, but it's definitely not the best option.\n\nFortunately, I work from home, so plan has just been staying in.   That really is the best strategy - only go out when you have to for work or to pick up something really important.   A few people I know who use the subway switched to using the bus, I think that's very helpful if you get the timing right because it's better not to be in the overly hot underground stations.   This is the time to stay in (unless you are someone who likes hot weather and there are a few people like that) and subscribe to a new streaming service/find good shows to watch and order food (nice tip to the delivery person).   Going out in the morning isn't bad and the humidity isn't nearly as bad as it could have been this week, however, it's still my preference to stay in and I can see how a lot of people prefer that.   I wonder how the restaurant scene has been, I would think much less people out for lunch but some people still going out in the evening after 7 pm.",

I\u2019m enjoying being home with my ac & streaming. I just finished running some errands, & it\u2019s not too bad out once it\u2019s nighttime.

The 4/5/6 platform at Union Square (and maybe even worse, the mezzanine above the trains) is hotter than the fires of hell. It\u2019s damn inhumane. Then you take the express train one stop to Grand Central, and the platform there is actually air conditioned. Unreal. I hate Union Square with a passion. \n\nBut yeah, upstairs and out in the sun isn\u2019t much fun, either. I have a headache now from heat exhaustion and maybe some mild dehydration.

            "People are more straight-forward and fast-paced in NYC. It can take some getting used to for midwesterners, but I love it. People are nicer than their reputation would imply and are usually happy to help, but they don\u2019t suffer fools. Know what you want before you ask for it or else be prepared to deal with a lot of annoyed looks. That\u2019s the main cultural difference I\u2019ve noticed.\n\nIn terms of the rest, if you feel comfortable with big cities, you\u2019ll enjoy NYC. It\u2019s Chicago on steroids. Brooklyn alone has about the same population as Chicago. Speaking of which, Manhattan is great, but I\u2019d recommend exploring the other boroughs when you can. There are so many hidden gems, you\u2019ll never find them all. But if you like exploring and discovering, there\u2019s really no better city in the US.\n\nThat said, if you feel the size of Chicago is overwhelming, or the desire to be a big fish in a little pond and need recognition, then NYC is not for you. Everything will be harder here from apartment hunting to waiting in line at the pharmacy, but the energy is intoxicating. People are always doing things. It\u2019s a bustling town, much more so than any other place in the US. If that\u2019s exciting, then this is the place for you.\n\nEDIT: spelling",
            "Things I like better about NYC:\n\nDon\u2019t need a car. I used to live near Western and Sunnyside, and the CTA got me most places I wanted to go, but my roommates had a car and it was objectively better for certain activities/trips. In NYC, the trains provide SO MUCH more coverage for 99% of the places I want to get to without needing a bus ride before/after to make up the rest of the trip. There\u2019s also just so much more stuff available. Whether it\u2019s restaurants or concerts or museums or sports or shopping, there are just plain more options here. Also, as much as I liked the theatre scene in Chicago, you just can\u2019t beat Broadway for live theatre availability. \n\nThings I miss about Chicago:\n\nLeona\u2019s. The beach. I grew up in Michigan, so I vastly prefer freshwater beaches instead of the saltwater that NYC has. Jewel-Osco. The downside of not needing a car is that you\u2019ll probably have to adjust your grocery shopping habits. Grocery stores aren\u2019t as big in a lot of neighborhoods, and you probably won\u2019t have a trunk to bring it home in, so you buy what you can carry, either in bags or a roll-y cart. I\u2019ve gotten used to more frequent shopping trips with fewer items each trip. The Loop. I personally liked having a bunch of \u201cthe city\u201d in that one defined area. NYC\u2019s points of interest are more numerous, but they\u2019re also spread out all over the place, so it has a different vibe. \n\nOverall, I like both cities a lot. If you liked Chicago, you\u2019ll probably like NYC too; there\u2019s just a bit of a learning curve while you get used to the different rhythms of New York.",
            "Born and raised in Chicago, lived in New York for more than a decade now. I never *really* understood what visitors meant when they said Chicago is so clean. Then I moved here. It\u2019s disgusting but you get used to it. \n\nThat being said, Chicago feels very small to me now. Fewer people walking around, fewer things to do, just less of everything. Which isn\u2019t always bad, just something that feels very palpable when I visit. I\u2019ve seen a lot of Chicagoans come and go in my time here so my general advice is if you\u2019re mostly happy in Chicago, stay in Chicago. New York has a way of wearing you down if you don\u2019t really *really* want to be here.",
            "I moved from NYC to Chicago in 2017 then to Philly then back to NYC.\n\nI loved the lower cost of living, the architecture, the art/music/culture scene, the unique neighborhoods (similar to NYC), the food (also similar to NYC), a lot of the people, the relative cleanliness, the spring and summers. While I never did buy something, the possibility of being able to purchase a house or condo at a much lower price was a huge factor.\n\nI left in 2020 because I missed the East Coast and the winters were brutal. Chicago can also feel isolated. One of the things I love about NYC and the east coast is how easy it is to get to other cities (DC, Boston, Philly, Baltimore) without needing to own or even rent a car or go to an airport. In Chicago, not that easy. I tried Philly for a couple years but it was not for me, I moved back to NYC early this year and am so, so happy that I did. \n\nChicago isn't perfect, but under the right circumstances, I would live there again - it has a ton of pro's and if you are looking for a break or a change from here, it's a solid option.",

Life is *a lot* harder in NYC, and not just because of the cost. It\u2019s more schlepping, more noise, more drama. Not for everyone. \n\nLiving in Chicago is not really like living in a city, it\u2019s like a big clean suburb that happens to have tall buildings.

I miss the sheer amount of things to do in NYC, and the variety of food available (used to live in Jackson Heights in Queens and that Elmhurst, and Woodside had enough alone to keep me busy for a long time). You really have to travel for that variety in Chicago and it's usually only one or two places (not multiple options like in NYC). The pizza in Chicago sucks ass. Deep dish is okay for a slice once in a while, but tavern style really just doesn't do it for me. There are a few places making NY style or similar, but even then, these would be mid places in NYC. Chinese food takeout in Chicago is also terrible. The worst I have ever had. I miss ordering takeout from any old shop in NYC and having it be solid nearly every time. There is decent Chinese food here, but just not in the casual takeout format. Oh, and definitely miss MTA. CTA is pretty inconsistent. Sometimes it's fine, but on the weekends especially, the headways can be over 20 minutes.

            "There\u2019s just more competition in day-to-day life. Competition for a seat on the subway or a spot in a line. Competition for jobs, for dates. I remember being in Millennium Park in Chicago and we went somewhere to grab lunch and we were shocked at how sedate it was. This was like the Chicago equivalent to Times Square and it was just quiet, plenty of seating (it\u2019s nothing like that in a touristy spot in NYC). Chicago just doesn\u2019t have the density or speed or aggressiveness of NYC and some people get \u201cchewed up and spit out\u201d, they have a few unpleasant experiences and realize how much more they\u2019re spending *just to get by* and decide it\u2019s not worth the trouble.",
            "I personally don't think it is as bad as it was when I first moved here 20 years ago, but it is not as clean as Chicago. We don't have alleys. The city is piloting a couple of programs in Manhattan a couple program that involving dumpsters in the street but it's going to be a while before broad adoption. It has gotten better though. The smell problem is really only over the summer and only in some areas (in my opinion.) \n\nNYC is, much like Chicago, a city of neighborhoods. If you like this aspect of Chicago, you'll love it here. There's also a subreddit for everyone of them. If you're considering a move, it's worth spending time and researching a few neighborhoods. I found my apartment through a broker on Zillow (the previous tenant paid the fee) but I'm sure you're aware moving here can be an expensive proposition but completely worth it. There are a zillion threads on it in this sub and in r/nyc. If you do move here, as long as you're cool and open to people and ideas and other points of view, you'll be welcome with open arms.",

In NY you can literally take public transportation directly to the Appalachian trail or several other mountainous hiking trails. There\u2019s also 3 or 4 separate real ocean beach areas you can access by public transportation. And if you have a car, you have access to way cooler shit within 2 hours than Chicago.

I now have two Midea U-shaped units and they're amazing. I run them on dehumidify mode and they do an amazing job of keeping the place cool with much less energy used. \n\nPrevent sun from warming your room by keeping the blinds closed during the sunniest part of the day (ie, east-facing windows in the morning, and west-facing ones in the later afternoon.) Use box fans to pull cool air in overnight, and during the day, position them in window sills on the shady side of your place to pull cooler air in. Balance that with a box fan blowing OUT of the sunny side.",

            "LOL.\n\nPeople survived heatwaves here before AC. I think the population density on Manhattan was much higher then too. People would sleep on their fire escapes.\n\nI just turned my AC on for the first time yesterday. The only problem with waiting this long is when you do give in & find out your AC is bust.\n\nI used to really struggle with the heat, I was so fucking miserable any time the AC was off at work, on the subway, outside etc. Eventually I tested a hunch that I was overdoing the AC & preventing my body from acclimating to the season.  Even thought it was 90 degrees outside I was still sleeping under blankets & as far as my body could tell it was just like winter except for those mad dashes between safe AC zones....\n\nEver notice how 65 degrees will give you goosebumps a the end of summer, but the same 65 degrees feels so warm coming out of winter?\n\nNow I just wait until I am actually uncomfortable to turn on the AC, and then once I am I turn it off, somewhere in the low 80s.  It honestly feels like removing humidity is 10x more important than removing heat.  Even banging isn't bad if you take a shower before & after like any decent human should, your muscles are so loose & powerful like speedballing muscle relaxers & steroids.\n\nAlong with linen & linen blends (especially pants... first time I wore them I could feel the breeze on my legs better than when wearing shorts. You'll feel exactly where your underwear stop allowing evaporation & air exchange) this is a great & cheap way to be so much more comfortable with the heat, to the point it feels good up to 90 & comfortable up to 95 if you relax....\n\nAt least if you are single. Girlfriends hate this one weird trick.\n\nTLDR\n\nOP check to make sure your AC works now so that when you do finally give in & boil over after installing the damned thing you can feel the cool rush of victory & not a soggy defeat like a hot fart as the devil himself picks you up between his butt cheeks like you were a boiled hotdog.\n\nNo tongs. just\n\n1.

We turn the AC off when the outside temperature drops in the evening and open the windows for a cross breeze.\n\nEdit to add: we do a lot to make sure we dont rely on AC all summer but understand that at a certain point it crazy uncomfortable to not have the option.",

You can also have it installed so that there is plexiglass on the sides instead of the plastic accordion things, that might give you a bit more light. \n\nI think that you're definitely going to want AC this summer especially if you're on the 8th floor.

It's not a health risk if you're young and healthy, and if it gets unbearable just go somewhere else with AC. Swap out your duvet for a light linen/cotton layer (surprises me how many people keep their down duvets in summer) and use a fan.

High humidity and CO2 bother me more, makes it stuffy.\n\nToday, for instance, the dehumid + air flow is keeping a large space with a couple of people at 88F, 49pct humidity and 420 CO2. A closed non AC/non dehumid space with some people time is 87F, 63pct humidity and 600 CO2. Yuck. A closed but dehumidified space with people is 87F, 49pct humidity but 700+CO2.
