It's a pity homosexuality is considered a MENTAL DISEASE in India and society is not mature enough to accept homosexuals. The thing is homosexuals are unable to express their sexuality out in public, they tend to come up with different albeit borderline offensive/offensive ways of expressing the same. I draw upon my experience of prescribing anti-psychotics for such patients who ended up in psych OPD because of a lack of services to help such people. \n\nHaving said that, I'd recommend talking to your parents, they'll help you process it in a better way.
