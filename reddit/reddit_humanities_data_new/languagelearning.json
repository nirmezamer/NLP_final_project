Both are logically correct from a matter of perspective, even if \"I couldn't care less\" is the proper phrase.\n\n\"I could care less\" can be interpreted as \"I am capable of caring (even) less in this situation\". The idea is that if you really and firmly cared, you would not have the mental and emotional capability to afford less caring. You can care less can mean to be uncaring because even if you already hardly cared, still there is room in your heart\u2014perhaps bottomlessly so\u2014to give less of a care. You are mentally capable of choosing to give less care at any point, something that would be impossible for someone who unconditionally cares.\n\nOf course the orthodox logic is actually that \"I could care less\" would mean that you do care and that there's a theoretical space for you to give less caring, whereas \"I couldn't care less\" means you are so absolutely devoid of caring that that font of care cannot be emptier. \n\nHowever, I argue against the idea \"I could care less\" is nonsensical in expressing lack of caring. It makes sense depending on one's perspective because \"capability of caring\" can mean different things to different people. It also depends on whether the metaphor being used for uncaring is a bottomless abyss or a container that can be utterly empty. Being dependent on the metaphor, there is no objective logic about it. And that is how the mistake began and proliferated. It is not just because the error became idiomatic. It is because the erroneous phrase can make logical sense to those unclear about the proper phrase.\n\nI'm not just making this up, by the way. I'm speaking both from personal experience and from knowing other people who have been confused in the same way.

Then if you want you can watch other things in French, with French subtitles if you're feeling bold.\n\nI also recommend the account \"frenchwithme_\" on Instagram, she's a French coach and she has a lot of recommendations in French (TV shows, music...).\n\nIn any case, there's nothing wrong with you, French is difficult, and as others said, Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is another type of French, so not the same French as you would find in a lot of media. That adds a level of difficulty to learn it.\n\nCourage ! (Stay strong!)",
            "How have you been learning so far?\n\nThere is most likely nothing wrong with you. You just need to put in the time, the efforts, and get solid resources. You won't just pick it up from the magical francophone air around you, you won't learn much from stupid toys like duo, you won't just magically get from 0 to awesome in a short time of immersion.\n\nIf you study hard, put in a few hours a day, with solid resources, you can get to B2 in 6-12 months. That is already an ok level to participate and not be a burden. From B2 on, the immersion sitaution helps much much more and you'll get to a high level, if you keep working on it.\n\nOh and btw: those immigrants very likely don't just \"learn English easily\". Many have already had some previous experience. And all of them put in a lot of work and have very strong motivation. The \"learn or give up on any kind of life you want\" motivation. You are clearly not in the same situation. Don't take their motivation and hard work for \"learning easily\". They just don't dare to tell you how much they struggle, how much energy they invest, and how scared many of them are of failing and being kicked out of the country.",

After that maybe take lessons or find a book you really like and read it (ideally an easier book that has an available audio book) and take notes, memorize vocab, and reread, listen, and relisten a bunch.

Immersion from zero leads most probably to nowhere. \n\nWhen people talk about immersion they most of the time mean comprehensible input anyway.

            "He's a bit inconsistent between his livestreams and his edited content so there are moments where he contradicts the stuff he says below, but his video on \"Was Krashens comprehensible input theory wrong?\" is borderline misinformation.\n\nFirst of all, academic jargon is very precise specifically *because* it's easy to mislead people and make strawman arguments, and that's what he appears to be doing throughout the entire video. The video is titled \"Is Everyone WRONG about Stephen Krashen's Comprehensible Input Theory?\", which is the first sign that he's going to say a bunch of bullshit. Krashen does not have a comprehensible input theory. He has The Input Hypothesis, which has been widely criticized and for good reason, but you might notice the change of terms makes it seem like only Krashenists believe in the importance of comprehensible input.\n\nHe then goes on to (correctly) describe a lot of the issues with Krashen's five hypotheses, for example the learning/acquisition hypothesis, but he makes it seem like these are weird, out-there ideas that don't resemble modern SLA at all. As the researcher Bill VanPatten pointed out a few years ago, the modern concept of explicit and implicit knowledge is more or less a more sophisticated version of what Krashen was saying. The learning-acquisition hypothesis is considered a \"no interface\" position (i.e., there's no way to turn the explicit knowledge you get from studying into an implicit understanding of the language you can use naturally). The dominant belief in the field right now is the *weak* interface position\u2014 the belief that there may be a relationship sometimes, but that relationship isn't always positive and it's not always direct. This is the actual problem most people have with Krashen's work\u2014 he said things that resemble modern SLA beliefs very closely, but was overly simplistic in the way he thought about them. Content-Based Instruction (CBI, the kind of instruction used in international schools, sometimes called CLIL), the style of education Krashen pioneered, has changed since its conception, but it is still considered the gold standard for classroom language learning.\n\nJones goes on to\u2014 in admittedly much more polite and indirect language than I'm going to use\u2014 basically accuse Krashen of being mentally ill and claiming his method, which is locking yourself in a bedroom and watching TV all day, might be good for people with ADHD (the stereotypical \u201cbad student\u201d disorder), while studying the good old fashioned way is good for normal people. This is wrong on *multiple* levels. Exactly where and why this is wrong could be a whole other rant... so I'm going to make it one!",
            "1 and 2 are extremely specific and things most natives can't do in their own languages. Those are just not good criteria.\n\n3 and 4 are reasonable.",
            "Faulty logic",
            "Why include the 4th criteria when it's so much easier than the first three lol. Anyone who has the vocabulary and verbal dexterity to write essays about complex topics and verbally debate them, as well as the ability to listen to a wide variety of podcasts, is well beyond the reading Harry Potter stage of reading comprehension. They will be able to read more complex material by that point.",
            "sorry, i was trying to make a joke about their son being a fake polyglot. please excuse me, english isnt my first language, its my fourth.",
            "First, Krashen never advocated for locking yourself away and never talking to people or opening a textbook. As I said, he pioneered CBI, a style of teaching where students talk to each other and interact all the time.\n\nJones is just straight-up misrepresenting Krashen\u2019s career with the ADHD tangent. And it seems to me like it was an intentional choice, considering that Jones replaced the input hypothesis with comprehensible input earlier in the video and in the title. It seems to me like he's either deeply, deeply misinformed and talking about stuff he doesn't understand at all, or he set out to misrepresent Krashen deliberately. Assuming the latter, we then need to ask why he *needs* to make a strawman argument here, and I think it is because\n\n...Jones goes on to imply that studying the traditional way is just as valid a \"method \" as getting tons of input is (or more valid, considering, again, Jones' implication that Krashen uses the strawman study method Krashen never used because he is mentally ill), which nobody in the field of SLA would remotely agree with.\n\nOne, because nobody believes in the use of methods. Everyone thinks you need to use a mix of techniques. But specifically on the topic of comprehensible input...\n\nI recently took a seminar with Rob Waring where we spoke about Paul Nation's Four Strands model. The four strands are 1) language-focused learning, 2) meaning-focused input, 3) meaning-focused output, and 4) fluency development. Reading and watching comprehensible content, mind you, is language-focused learning if you're looking the words up and using anki, meaning-focused input if you're reading stuff that's easy enough to forget the language and focus on the meaning, and fluency development if you're reading something easy enough to let you practice inputting in large quantities at a natural pace. Meaning-focused output requires you to know 98% of what you're saying or it isn't considered meaning-focused by Nation. In other words, comprehensible input covers 3/4 strands and the remaining strand requires a great deal of comprehensible input before you can even begin improving in it.\n\nBoth Nation and Waring disagree with how important each of these strands are or what qualifies as what, but they both agree that about 97% of what Japanese students do in English class (a few specific types of language-focused learning) should be about 6% of what we do. The main benefit of grammar study and pronunciation drills is that they help us notice features of the language. But we're not meant to just do the drills and read the explanations over and over until we get fluent-- the noticing hypothesis says you need to explicitly notice the features of the language *in your input*. The output hypothesis says output is helpful because it tests hypotheses *in your input* and then helps you notice the gap between your output *and your input*. Most SLA researchers agree that the majority of your study with the language needs to be actually using the language. And Jones explicitly calls input just that in the video, saying input is the language itself.\n\nAttacking the value of comprehensible input or calling it \"a method\" is more or less indefensible. The modern consensus is that input in massive quantities is \"necessary but insufficient\"-- in other words, it's necessary!\n\nSo Jones instead criticizes the Input Hypothesis and Krashen's Five Hypotheses, which are easy to criticize, swaps the name \"Input Hypothesis\" out for \"Comprehensible Input Theory\", and then concludes by saying that maybe input works for you if you're neurodivergent while implying normal people should study the old-fashioned way (again, spending most of your time doing things that big name experts in the field agree should only be like 6% of what your study time at most).\n\nJones has said offhandedly he prefers to \"study and then get thousands of hours of input\" in other videos, but that is another common misdirection\u2014 he's implying that the input is what you do after you study, and not a necessary part of it, that you study the language to actually learn it and then using the language is the result.\n\nWaring says you will never reach basic competence until you've taken in 4,000,000 words, and that that would entail at least 45 minutes--1 hour of pure input per day outside of what students do in class. Waring notes this is critically important because most students, even with the review they do in class, just won't see the words or grammar enough to remember any of it unless they get comprehensible input. You would be better off *studying your input* with a dictionary and grammar guide than putting input off until after you've studied enough, because as Waring implies, you'll never study enough to outpace the forgetting curve without extensive input.",
