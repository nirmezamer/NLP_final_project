How much gravel, and what size did you use to fill behind the wall? Sorry for all the questions, I\u2019m just really considering doing something very similar.",
            "Really impressive!\n\nCurious: is that kind of wall more expensive or cheaper than building a wall with armour stone or those manufactured wall blocks?",
            "Hi there,\n\nGreat work , Please follow the following tips!\n\nGrass laws have always been an important topic whereby many people seek to know how to have a rich green grass area.\n\nI must congratulate you for being such a good grass lawn owner. Here are simple guidelines on how to ensure it grows into a healthy tall and mighty tree.\n\nFirstly, perform routine core aeration and use a soil liquid aerator once a month to soften the surface. Expect to water your lawn once a week and if there is rain, add that amount to reach a total of about one inch per week.  \n  \nAs for the fertilizer, apply a solution of fertilizer, for instance 16-4-8, at the intervals of 6-8 weeks when the plant is growing and depending on the fertility of the soil as dictated by the soil test.  \n  \nSelect a fitting Bermuda grass seed to use and plan for overseeding after the 4-month pre-emergent period will elapse in mid June.  \n  \nFinally, to prevent the kids and dogs from giving lawns a raw deal, a good idea is to swap their play zones to avoid compaction and use a mulch layer in hot zones.  \n  \nI hope this helps! Well, good luck and have fun with mowing the lawn!\n\nHappy Pure Air!",

            "Had neighbors terrace their front yard. There was about a 35 foot elevation difference between the northeast/south west diagonal. The terraces were all built with railroad ties and incorporated French drains to direct excessive water towards the culvert between the street and yard.",
            "Yes, how were the walls done??",
            "Same",
            "Wish I had those all those answers.  The wall definitely wasn\u2019t a job I did myself but I\u2019ll try and provide a little detail from what I observed as the contractor did their work.  \n\nThe job required a lot of earth moving to dig enough space below ground (they used a mini backhoe and shovels) and also get a level tier.  Thankfully my neighbor needed fill to level a portion of their yard so disposal of excess was easy.\n\nThe wall itself was just bags of cement mixed on site in a mixer, they dropped a bunch of raw stones and were cracking them by hand to build the wall and facade bit by bit.  \n\nBehind the wall wasn\u2019t backfilled with gravel.  The walls are only 3ft high and just winning the battle by not being that high and being dense.",
            "Thank you!\n\nI would assume more expensive but I didn\u2019t get a quote for this project using uniblock style bricks so don\u2019t have a direct comparison.  Material wise I think it maybe close, but my sense is as done it is more labor intensive and skilled.  Others on this sub I\u2019m sure could tell you with a lot more authority than me.",
            "Upvote only for username!",
            "Phew! Good thing you did the bench yourself. Without saving those $500, you would have never been able to afford this! \n\nAll jokes aside, great job it looks awesome. I\u2019m very jelly.",
            "Good pricing",
            "I keep realizing in this sub that I'm not charging enough.",
            "Great deal and looks fantastic!",
            "Luckily away, but unluckily right into a neighbor's much flatter yard. But if yours is doing okay then that makes me think I'm over worried about it.",
            "Ooh, that's very interesting, and similar to our neighbor higher up the hill. The french drains make perfect sense for managing water, too.\n\n\nThank you very much for the extra info. It helps me understand parts of the process better!",
            "\ud83d\ude05 yeah\u2026 I did the irrigation and in ground lighting myself too.",
            "It worked relatively well for them, although due to the slope of the yard, the ended up with three small upper terraces that were about 4 feet elevation differences and a lower terrace that was significantly larger but required more earth to be moved.  The side along side their neighbor to the south was almost 7 feet at the street and was still staggered so there was still a slight slope on that level.  They ended up planting Ivy on the high elevation platforms to avoid lifting the lawn mower.  But the French drainage worked to minimize erosion. I saw it recently after about 20 years and it looks the same"

Even during a dry summer ground water is about 4-6 inches. There are some trees right at the edge of the creek. And a lot of running bamboo unfortunately. I'm dealing with that, but I won't ever win that war because of stands on adjacent properties. Fairly heavy deer pressure, especially in winter when the farms nearby aren't feeding them. I thought about kalmia latifolia on the creek banks just for the sake of low maintenance. But then that will be all I have and it will grow very low and dense there making it difficult to keep the bamboo under control. \n\nThe areas for screening are out of the flood plain and much better drained. 15 foot elevation difference. I was thinking about ilex opaca for that. I'll have to keep it from spreading too much, but mowing should take care of that. I don't care what the lawn I'm keeping looks like. I'm trying to make it mostly clover where I can.\n\nI recently had a company that specializes in native restoration come in to weed invasives and seed a lot of the open lawn for wet meadow. But I'm not too happy with them for the cost. So I'm thinking about doing the rest myself. \n\nI fortunately don't have a lot of invasives besides the bamboo.

            "I bought 30 yards of shredded bark mulch last year. I had them do two deliveries of 15 yards because I needed time to move the mulch from the driveway to the backyard. For the first 15 yards, I moved it myself to the backyard, one rolling garbage can at a time. It took me over a day and a half, having to stop during the hot part of the day. The second load, I had 3 day laborers helping, and we were moving 3 rolling garbage cans at a time. It was done in 90 minutes. Once in the backyard, the real work started as the mulch needed to be spread onto a hillside. With the day laborers, the four of us got it spread on the hillside in about a day. The hardest part was bringing the mulch up in 20 gallon cans up the stairs over and over again.\n\nOne thing that really saved my ass was that I have been working out a lot at the gym - things like squats, deadlifts, core and even stair climber. All that time in the gym paid off, as I was not sore from this (and I'm not young anymore).",

I am in New Jersey, labor for something like this would be about $3000 about 9k in the block cause that looks to me about 8ft tall with at least 2 courses into the ground for stability, I personally would hold it back with rebar for a sound structure. So another $200 and then another $500 for mortar, glue, lock tite or any other materials that may be needed.

Check local codes because in my area, they allow a retaining wall to be built 4ft tall without any permits. Anything taller requires a permit and possibly engineering designs.\n\nBut definitely make sure to have whoever builds it design it properly. Crushed stone, perforated drainage pipe with wall drains ideally, and filter fabric as well. I would absolutely make sure that geogrid is used as well no matter what as its purpose is to help a wall maintain its structure and prevent hydrostatic pressure pushing the wall out and failing especially for taller walls.\n\nI spent a lot of time researching and speaking with a local Nicolock supplier for almost 2 years before I underwent this massive project of mine so I had an understanding of what needs to be done and how to make sure it was being done properly especially to manufacturers specs. The landscaper I hired was even impressed by my knowledge that I had. \n\nPoint is, it doesn\u2019t hurt to educate yourself a little so you understand what is to be expected. Many YouTube videos and online resources of people showing/explaining it and it is something that you can build yourself especially at 4ft high but in many cases may be more beneficial to hire a pro to do it. \n\nPrice wise it varies as I have been priced ridiculous prices from various contractors over the years. The contractor that I hired was a small contractor that seemed to have about 12 years experience but just started his 2nd year running his small business so he gave me an offer I couldn\u2019t refuse honestly for my project.

            "I've been retaining water...\n\nIt's been known to be a part of the many beers that cross my path \ud83d\ude1c\ud83c\udf7b\ud83c\udf7b",
            "No way! That would be dangerous without the wall tied back into the fill behind the wall.\u00a0",
            "On commercial-scale projects, sure. \n\nNot that many people out here having 15 vertical feet of engineer-designed, rebar tied concrete poured in their back garden lol",
            "Call the UN for humanity's sake, you must share the technology with our continent, we're on the brink of collapse here, being unable to build any retaining wall beyond 4.5 meters.",
            "They do it here too.",
            "given what others have said and the scale of the job i would say more like 100k + to do a good job that will last any amount of time",
            "Terracing too?",
            "Gabion wall would do it. Obviously no a good spot for a concrete wall.",
            "The guy that quoted me does a lot of landscaping/stone work for different people in my neighborhood. I\u2019m not sure how \u201cofficial\u201d he is, but he does do good, quality/lasting work. He said his labor is $1200 and he gets his company discount at Home Depot so the materials would be roughly $950.",
            "It\u2019s metro Atlanta!",
            "Quarry near me sells them for 80 bucks a ton.  What is that like 40 ton maybe?  80 bucks a ton.  Plus 360 bucks for trucking.  Probably closer to 4k but it might only take like 30 ton.  I am not used to estimating boulder quantities like I am riprap or other aggregates.  Only thing is tough to tell from the photo but that looks like more than 4\u2019 high",
            "They are already there. Its been there 60 years and our neighbor is the one who dig it out to build their house so its not our property.",
            "I fully agree with you, that\u2019s why some people cheap out and call the landscaper ((me)) but personally I do not do structural retaining walls like this, for the simple reason I am a landscaper. I do have a mason that we use on large projects like this, but I let him handle the quote. I have had people try to skimp out and I personally turn them down and let them know I am not qualified they can use my mason or another and I\u2019ll come plant the plants and cut the trees, or build you a nice garden bed \u201cretaining\u201d wall. Usually they run about 4k max",
            "Sounds like the guy who quoted me $20,000 for a 60 foot wall that is 1\u2019 on one end and 3\u2019 on the other. Im doing it myself. $3,000 in materials. i can dig a trench and level some RCA for $17,000 in savings + bonus squats. People are batshit insane with these prices.",
            "It\u2019s a baaad night to be a Modelo, in my book",
            "You don't buy beer, you rent it",
            "Not for 4-foot high eco-block wall. Above 4 feet, and yeah.",
            "Why concrete? Just use Boulders. And every second house built in a slope has this",
            "That wasn't meant to flex on Americans. In fact i wanted to say if this is standard for us, surely it's not that big of an issue in the US either.",
            "Your comment made it sound that it's too big of a project to stack boulders 15 feet high.",
            " using large riprap or boulders is ideal in this situation because it\u2019s a natural area and it will allow the slope to erode a little stabilize itself and age maintenance free.",
            "I watched some Amish masons take down and rebuild a dry stack wall maybe 100\u2019 by 10\u2019 at the tallest.  I could not fathom what that must have cost, nor the expertise required.  150k?   Just two or three guys chippin away at it for a few months.",
            "I\u2019ll do you one Better . A 30\u2019 cmu wall, 24\u201d tall, stucco, with some lettering glued to it. $80k\n\nThey literally do it to see what they can get away with. Unfortunately, US is filled with lazy stupid people, who think that \u201cinflation\u201d is the cause. \nThis is probably one of the biggest periods of money grabs from contractors in recent history.",
            "And then piss it away.",
            "I\u2019m thinking of the cost",
            "People are obviously talking about cost. We\u2019re not \u201cunable\u201d to do it, but most people can\u2019t afford to do commercial projects in their backyards",
            "I told the owner that I would do it for him on the weekends and then buy a car after, and still be half price",
            "IMO It is really sad how useless most people are for any kind of trade skills. Its so easy to get tutorials for anything you can think of now and people are somehow growing even lazier and less competent while the costs skyrocket and craftsmanship plummets. Theres only 1 other guy on my street that cuts his own lawn. We have the best looking lawns in the neighborhood.",
            "Eh our 50 year old house has a 12 foot or so retaining wall in our backyard and it seems fine and I doubt it was commercial level effort.",
            "100%. I also cut my own lawn, and I definitely have the best looking yard on my street if not the community.\n\nMost people pay to have their yards maintained by 2-3 dudes who could give a shit and only know how to chew at everything for 15 minutes then move on to the next idiots house"
