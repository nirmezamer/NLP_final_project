So its overturning is symbolic, but still good news.\n\nA couple of months ago, the Namibian courts also declared that a same-sex marriage performed had to be recognized by the government. Hopefully, this momentum will continue and broader protections for LGBT people will be put in place.",

            "Damn i used to watch Greg doucette (guy in blue) 5 years ago. Sad to see he became a fascist",
            "i\u2019ve always felt like Jubilee videos exist as slop content that feeds on people\u2019s rage and i\u2019ve always hated how little you learn from any of their videos. i despise their content.",
            "I have only ever watched a jubilee video of its covered by vaush. Too frustrating and boring to watch otherwise.",
            "Remember when vaush actually watched and reacted to stuff instead of talking for 10 minutes about shit?",

            "I used to really love Greg Doucette but he really fell off and fell down the shaft of the vaccine-skeptic, anti-trans, anti-woman shit-pit.\n\nSimilar story with Alan Roberts/Every Damn Day Fitness. Used to be an aggressive, passionate fitness personality who was actually very empathetic and seemed to just want what was best for folks, but then went insane when Covid happened and started basically implying that if you got sick, it was on you for not prioritising your health/fitness enough\u2026.then proceeded to try and arrange an exclusive unmasked cruise (you know, in the middle of a plague).\n\nI think the roids must eventually rot all these dudes brains.",
            "Simply watch the video yourself and react",
            "He's always done this, what are you actually on about. His entire demeanor and channel is centered around talking about shit.",

            "I don\u2019t watch those types of videos. And even if I did, it\u2019s not the same as watching vaush react to it in the analytical way that he does, picking apart the arguments. Something I can\u2019t do",
            "I don't know how to react",
            "No I get that. I\u2019m talking about when he has a 10+ minute video with the title and thumbnail reacting to a video, and then he doesn\u2019t watch any of the video. If he put out an hour long video, I expect that he goes off on tangents, but this is different",
            "Jeff Nippard and Mike Isreatel are still great at least, if either of those two ever go off the right-wing conspiracy nut deep end I\u2019m ~~jumping off a cliff~~ quitting the gym",

            "I\u2019m with you, but I also understand why Vaush and others don\u2019t want to spend much time covering these sort of videos anymore. It\u2019s honestly sad, I remember watching Vaush critique Jubilee, PragerU, etc. back in 2020 before/while I was canvassing, and it helped me a lot with my rhetoric when talking to voters. But when you watch what these channels are making now, they\u2019re not even trying to make good arguments anymore (not that they were ever good to begin with), so there\u2019s nothing to analyze. I watch TMR almost every day, and they try to do the same thing with Dave Rubin and Tim Pool clips, but I can\u2019t honestly watch those segments anymore because it\u2019s just total brain rot.",
