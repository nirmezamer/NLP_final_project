            "Idc who it is, what their condition is, you abuse my dog after deliberately teasing them with food or a toy or whatever. I will give you a taste of your own medicine. Animals are the only innocent beings on this planet and this pregnant lady thought that just because she was pregnant that she could get away with kicking OOP\u2019s dog. She can\u2019t lose the baby if the belly isn\u2019t kicked in this scenario. Pregnancy isn\u2019t a justification to abuse anyone or anything",

            "Reading some of ops older posts, she has a history of having issues with pregnant people, and specifically says she's infertile and sad about it, and says for the reader to decide if that plays a part, and it really seems like OP just has unresolved issues with jealousy around pregnant women",
            "This is one of those stories where I feel like there\u2019s more to it but it was left out to make OP look good\u2026",
            "Both sides were wrong in this situation. I didn\u2019t care for that sister\u2019s comment to the OP either. The dog was the only one innocent here, lol",

            "Did you kick her in the stomach or leg? \n\n\nKicking her leg isn't going to kill her baby.\n\nAlso I worked residential for 2 pregnancies. You'd be surprised what the pregnant body can do and not :kill the baby.\"\n\nI.was kicked, hit, did physical holds (this was before we stopped doing them) and more all while pregnant. First one I worked up until the day before I went into labor. Second one the doctor and midwife wrote me out at 36 weeks because I had gotten kicked on the leg and he didn't like that the clients were that aggressive. I.was well that's just normal everyday stuff there but ok.",

I don't get why she didn't remove herself and the pet from said situation. Or, if unable to move out, then train the animal or at least go to a room.\n\nShe felt she did something to protect her animal but *she didn't*, instead of acting like that to \"protect her baby\" she should have done more to prevent the damage from actually happening in the first place.\n\nEdit: people often believe that feeling good about themselves is the same as being actually good to the animals they love",

            "There are so many scenarios in this sub where the title alone sounds like it will be a clear decision against the OOP, and then the story goes in the complete opposite direction. I keep reminding myself not to judge on the title alone.",
            "In my defense I\u2019m only a raging asshole to people that deserve it. Like this dog kicker. I volunteer as a call-in to kick the shit out of dog kicking pregnant women. Two pregnancies will cancel that shit out.",
            "Right? No one wants your crappy kids, so don\u2019t act like you being in the process of making them makes you special. You\u2019re cooking up garbage and no one is looking forward to meeting your bundle of insecurities",

            "I think OP was the justiable asshole here. You don\u2019t go to someone\u2019s house and bitch about their dog/cat/etc and you sure the fuck don\u2019t tease a dog with food like that. She\u2019s lucky the dog just took the food and didn\u2019t bite her in the process and you sure the hell don\u2019t hurt the dog afterwards because it got frustrated and took what you kept promising and refused to give.",
            "The story is bullshit anyway, none of OPs comments make sense, just made up for Reddit keyboard warriors to foam at the mouth saying \"if you kick my dog I'll punch you in the face\".\n\n\nAnd if it is true, OP activity allowed it to escalate so that they could assault somebody.\n\n\nThis whole thing made me lose hope in the Reddit community tbf, the comments on the OP saying they hope she does lose the baby because \"animal abusers don't deserve happiness\" is alarming.",

            "in the comments op says they were sitting in the dog\u2019s room, like where their water, couches and toys are. so it\u2019s weird that a) the sister who lives here would choose that room for chatting and b) the friend would complain about what would clearly be a dog\u2019s space. i doubt it\u2019s real esp since op made about 100 comments on the post, but if it is somehow, then that\u2019s just a weird situation with some rude people on all sides",

            "This is how you get your ass whooped real good, by messing with people's pets and kids.",
            "Dang it. I snort laughed at this and scared my dog.",
            "There\u2019s literally someone in this comment section saying they would have deliberately kicked her stomach to kill the baby. (There\u2019s also someone else did a profile dive and found out OOP is infertile and hates pregnant women, so she\u2019s basically just gathering revenge fantasies. Truly well-adjusted behavior.)",
            "I don't think the pregnant woman even exists tbf.",

            "I am generally a very docile person but I\u2019ve felt enough of the jolt of pure adrenaline-fueled rage (from a much lesser offence) that I can guarantee that woman would be about to learn some decency the hard way.",
            "No, it isn't, I doubt OP kicked the woman in the stomach. Put your hands and feet on my dog in any aggressive way, and you're free game.",
            "She just booted her in the shin. Tbh I'll take the downvotes she ain't pregnant in her shin is she. Much deserved, Poor dog. Bitch is lucky she's pregnant and op stayed so calm. She taunted the dog repeatedly when SHE could have left. Ngl I don't like somewhere and find it unclean or unkempt I leave but guess that's just me \ud83e\udd37. Even the bible said an eye for an eye.",
            "Hahah yea okay kick a pregnant woman. Man, I\u2019m tired of stupid people and dog parents, it\u2019s an animal, get over it. I would rya street fighter skin kick that dog off this planet and right into the moon.",
            "Being pregnant doesn't mean you can be an asshole without consequences. \n\nRepeatedly teasing, then kicking an animal in someone else's home is a dumbass way to keep your unborn child safe. Yeah, I'm tired of stupid people, too.",
            "If you don\u2019t want to get kicked? Don\u2019t be a colossal asshole in someone else\u2019s home and don\u2019t go out of your way to abuse their pets. It\u2019s really that simple.",
            "If the pregnant woman acted like a civilized human being and not like a raging asshole, none of this would have happened.",
            "You are a stupid person... \"It's an animal\"? Yes, animals have feelings just like people. You don't have any obviously.",

I know you\u2019d like to believe that wasn\u2019t his intent, but I don\u2019t see any reason he would need that, even if it does include your fence line. Your neighbor also had the chance to change the angle after you spoke to him about your concerns but didn\u2019t. \n\n\nYou\u2019re NTA and neither is your daughter. Your neighbor is a creep.",

We moved from Dallas Texas to Fargo ND and my wife was concerned about a white van that would sit outside of our apartment every night. The cops not only got the security footage from the apt complex and 2 other stores near the area but found the vehicle owner the same day, they tracked the dude down and called him and it turned out to be some poor Mexican contractor working nights and just taking lunch really late. I felt kinda bad for the guy because he seemed very shocked and apologetic. It's weird having issues actually responded to by police promptly.",
            "Riiiiight! From all these stories you'd think cops are really responsive and involved in their job so much so that as soon as the neighbour went in to file a complaint about a camera being damaged they jumped in the car immediately without further checks to mend this injustice and get that 50 bucks back!\n\nMeanwhile, in our timeline and paralel universe, people get stabbed in broad daylight and the police is nonchalant about it.",
            "The story doesn\u2019t say what time frame there was from when the camera got messed up, the cops were called or a complaint filed, to when they actually showed up. I would assume a complaint was filed and the cops eventually showed up to talk to them about it, and neighbor eagerly came over when he saw they were there (or knew they were coming at that date/time) to point his finger and show his evidence.\n\n\nEdit to add that cops generally seem to care more about property damage than they do people.",
            "I was wondering just how much time the cops have on their hands that they'll wade through weeks and weeks of footage--as well as, just how recently did they finally buy their daughter curtains? That they just left her window uncovered until recently, they must be compete morons-- or the author has some plot holes.",

And they get *pissed* if you \"make them\" do their job. \n\nI also got berated by cops and taken down to the station with gravel and dirt in my face and hair. I was put in a cell, told I was going to wind up there permanently if that continued, because my neighbours saw/heard my mom's husband beating me in the driveway and called the police. My face was bruised and bleeding. I was ten.\n\nI live in a \"first world\" place and cops have an 80% domestic violence rate (and that's just the reported rate, ignoring anyone who doesn't report, or anyone who cops won't take a report from which is incredibly common) and they're the number one source of cocaine smuggling, above an international gang. \n\nMy boyfriend's place of work got robbed of 80k worth of equipment. Cops came and said tough, that's not our job. It took two weeks and the owner of the company calling for anyone to come and take a report. They get so unbelievably mad when they have to do anything, too, like it's your fault you got beat up, raped, robbed. Disturbing. \n\nI think stories like this are prevalent because people want a fantastical version of justice. It's sad.",

But as long as you can get a clear shot into the window without moving things or jumping fences, you\u2019re legally in the clear to record through a window in most places at least in the US. Doesn\u2019t count as trespassing and the cops won\u2019t do anything without good reason. The daughter being an all-but-naked child in the video is likely the only reason that the cops did anything at all.

            "Edit: added tl/dr at the bottom\n\nWhile I absolutely agree that the nursery shouldn't be in the basement for a myriad of reasons, I'd take any bet that if someone gets their way, that was never the plan anyway.\n\nAll in all I think OOP sounds like a good dad. Alice is mental if she truly thinks that her requests are reasonable. Considering her choice words for OOP's daughter, I'm guessing all she sees in Stacy is a living representation of OOP's late wife. On the one hand, I can imagine a relationship with a widower can't be easy as it's very likely that if their spouse hadn't passed, you would not be in a relationship with the widower.\n\nOn the other hand, I absolutely agree with OOP that Alice is giving major wicked stepmother vibes. I doubt it'll stop at pushing Stacy out or her room\u2013I wouldn't be surprised if Alice's actual plan is to give Stacy's room and her project room to her own kids, turn the leftover room upstairs into the nursery and shove Stacy into the basement.\n\nDoes that sound borderline cartoonishly extreme? Yes. Do I still think had OOP been receptive to the idea of moving Stacy out of her room, this had slowly but surely become the outcome? Absolutely. \n\nThe \"arguments\" to guilt trip OOP are pretty obvious too: Alice already started with them when she mentioned it's \"unfair\" that Stacy and OOP have spaces where they can be all alone as well as Stacy having an entire bathroom to herself. Since OOP needs his office to for his work (and he is not the issue anyway), Stacy has to give up her space.\n\nSo **what if** OOP agreed that in the spirit of the new, blended family, Stacy had to give up her room. Well, then there is the other thing. Does it really make sense to put the nursery in the basement? Alice and OOP will have months of sleepless nights until the baby will be able to sleep through the night. Does he really expect his sleep deprived, physically exhausted partner (Alice) after just giving birth to fumble her way down who-knows-how-many stairs through an unfamiliar, gigantic house in the dark of night (!!!) when she's possibly distraught as she fully knows that her baby needs her and is crying out to *her,* their mother! Does OOP really want to risk Alice's and the baby's lives by putting the nursery in the basement? What if something happens and Alice slips on the stairs?? What if they can't reach the baby in time and something happens to the baby?? Could OOP live with himself knowing that he's indirectly responsible for it because of how he assigned the rooms? Could Stacy live with herself for essentially killing her sibling because of her stubbornness?\n\nWouldn't it \"make more sense\" to move Stacy into the basement and have the nursery close to the parents bedroom? Besides, having any set of Alice's children move into the basement room would make them feel singled out and not accepted and are OOP and Stacy saying that Alice's kids are not family now??\n\n**END OF INSANE GUILT TRIP ARGUMENTS ALICE COULD USE AGAINST OOP, NOT MY ACTUAL OPINION**\n\nI remember a few days ago there was a post about a bride who insisted on a child free (16yrs+) wedding and refused to make any exceptions. Including\u2014or rather, especially\u2014for the groom's 15yr old son. At some point, bride let it slip that having the groom's son, aka her soon-to-be step-son, at the wedding would be just like having groom's ex there. And besides, why would the groom want anyone from his \"old family\" there when it's about starting a new family with the bride? I'm pretty sure everyone said groom would be the asshole if he went ahead with the wedding (iirc the groom replied to the bride that his son will always be his family and no one will change that).\n\nAnyway, I wouldn't be surprised if Alice's plan is to fully push Stacy (and her older brother) out of the \"new\" family. There is no way in hell, Alice won't redecorate the house and remove any and all traces of OOP's late wife, their two children and late wife's family photos as soon as Alice and her kids move in. \n\n\nShe is already upset that OOP agreed Stacy would be paid for any kind of babysitting. Stacy is older than Alice's kids and will get her license before any of them and *yet* Alice is upset that Stacy has been promised her late mother's old car for when she is old enough. Alice was fully planning on giving Stacy a life straight out of a fairytale\u2014Cinderella, only without a prince charming who will come rescue her. Or better yet, with a platonic knight in shining armour aka her older brother. If he took Stacy in, Alice wouldn't have to worry about her at all anymore. (/s)\n\nDoes Alice know that OOP intends to have his daughter inheret the house? If she does, I wouldn't be surprised if Alice's endgame would be to do her very best to manipulate/gaslight OOP into cutting his two older kids off and revise their prenup/his will to leave the house and estate to Alice and her kids. If she doesn't know about OOP's plan to leave the house to Stacy, well the Alice is in for a rude awakening.\n\nDoes my theory seem farfetched, extreme and make Alice look like a step-mother so evil and villainous she could only exist in fiction? Yes. Yes, it does. Could it still be true because humans are greedy, jealous and insane? Yep, definitely.\n\n\nHonestly though, I hope I'm wrong and as a child of divorce with a complicated relationship to both my parents, I hope OOP stays steadfast in his devotion to his kids and keeps being a good dad.\n\n\nTL/DR: How could Alice possibly live happily ever after in Wonderland if OOP can't prove he isn't still in love with Stacy's mom?\n\n(That last one is for John lol)",
            "Wait, he promised Stacy she'd inherit the house even though she has other bio siblings, as a condition of her *allowing* her stepmother to move in? And he's perfectly happy to end the relationship with *his new baby's mother* if Stacy doesn't get her way in everything? I understand wanting to make his daughter happy, but this 15 year old has way too much power over these adults' lives.\n\nSome of the treatment he's giving Stacy is admirable and will go a long way to easing this transition for her, but only for *her*. The other kids and his new wife can all go hang apparently. Setting one kid apart as a higher class of citizen apart from your new wife and step kids is not going to end well. He wants to put a newborn in the basement and acts like asking Stacy to give up her TikTok dance studio is a generous compromise. Why even marry someone if you're going to ask them to shoulder all the burden of the transition and not take any on yourself? It sounds like he's only willing to get married if everything in his life can stay exactly the same and nothing inconveniences him or Stacy.",

So I moved in, and kids would start being dropped off between 5-7am. She'd start making them breakfast, and they'd just come into my room and play. Take my blankets, hit me with toys, take and break my things, you name it. I begged my dad to help fix this as it was summer time and completely unfair to me. I had gone to her a few times the first week after we moved in, but she really didn't do anything. No one offered me a lock. \n\nAfter waking up to two 9 year old boys hitting me with bats one morning, I freaked out. I screamed bloody murder (of course).

I\u2019m not saying that doesn\u2019t involve Stacy keeping her room, I\u2019m just saying her thoughts on the matter should be taken into equal account.

And considering how fragile infants really are I'd be more scared than upset about the distance I'd have to cover in case something happened. Babies can die for anything and over everything. SIDS, suffocating to death literally just from turning over and being unable to turn back over, choking on their own vomit, getting stuck between the cot in the crib and the wall if there's a gap to fall in, the list goes on and all of those are real life examples of deaths that families have had to go through.

Imagine your dad's 3 minutes of joy turning into your three years of nightmare.\n\nAlso the gf is already drowning in entitlement.",
            "Yeah, but the baby is eventually gonna grow into a person that needs it\u2019s own space. Shell need a room eventually, and the basement isn\u2019t gonna be a good option until she\u2019s quite a bit older",
            "Putting the baby in the basement is crazy but he gets to decide what to do with his house, fairly or unfairly not Alice. It\u2019s not her house, truthfully , maybe she needs to take this as a red flag and bounce."
