[Click here](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements) to review eligibility requirements.\n\n2021-2022 school year: Use the 2021-2022 FAFSA, which opened October 1, 2020. Requires 2019 tax information.\n\n2022-2023 school year: 2022-2023 FAFSA will became available October 1, 2021. Requires 2020 tax information.\n\n**First time? Here's a step-by-step guide.**\n\n* Create an [FSA account](https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch) (also known as the FSA ID). This is your legal electronic signature to sign the FAFSA. It's linked to your Social Security number. If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well, assuming they have an SSN. If your parent already has their own FSA account, they must use that. If your parent does not have an SSN, they must print and sign the signature page manually, then mail it in.\n\n* Gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, tax information (W-2s, tax returns), any records of untaxed income, etc.\n\n* Start the FAFSA! If you or your parent are given the option to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, use it! It will drag tax information from the IRS straight to the FAFSA and save you a lot of time.\n\nDo not guess on the FAFSA. If you have a question, post here or [contact the Federal Student Aid Info Center](https://studentaid.gov/help-center/contact).",

            "My parents refuse to submit information for their portion of Fasfa so I put extenuating circumstance/can\u2019t provide information. When I submitted, it said I needed to contact my school. My school isn\u2019t being helpful whatsoever, they\u2019re actually being very rude. They said they will not consider helping me because my parents refusing to provide information isn\u2019t their problem. What do I do?",
            "I did the FAFSA this year and my EFC is like $176,503. Without my rich step-dad, my EFC would be around $9,873. The problem is that my step-dad won't help pay for my education (which after scholarships it's like $2,700) a semester because he straight up said to me \"Because I'm not your father\". Meanwhile me and my mother had to scrape almost all of our savings (and our money mind you) to pay my tuition bill, and if I drop out for a semester my tuition jacks up to $5,700 a semester. How on earth am I gonna get the financial aid I need? \n\nI'm in the state of Ohio and I attend Cleveland State University if that helps.",
            "I've been very sad and depressed for several months. My grandma died, I feel tired all the time, I find it difficult to speak with my friends, my body feels disgusting. All I have been doing is waking up, going to work, and immediately going to sleep or staying in bed. I signed up for the current semester a month ago. I've been going to classes for 2 weeks. I've been doing homework but have stupidly been neglecting my emails. I logged in to do homework today and found out that my schedule was deleted. I noticed I got an email from the business office Wednesday telling me that my schedule was in danger of being deleted because of my account balance. But the problem is that I can no longer find out what I needed to pay (I've never been knowledgeable about understanding financial aid stuff). I would probably be able to afford it though. I have a ton of homework to do but I can't even access it. What do I need to do to figure this out?",
            "Hello! I'm simply asking this on the behalf of my sister. \n\nShe is planning on moving in with her girlfriend after high school, who also lives with her own parents. When filling out FASA is it weird if her new address doesn't match the address of her mother/stepfather when it comes to the income aspect of things? I know this may be poorly worded, but I thought I'd give it a shot.",

            "My pell grant has been reduced from around 10k to 872$ for this semester and next semester. I got unemployment last year due to the pandemic, is this why I am getting such a small amount from FAFSA? What can I do to obtain more financial aid?",

I am currently a dependent and have no way in hell of leaving any time soon due to my current income and bills. Are there any options for me outside of FAFSA if theres no way? I currently have a 3.85 GPA in Computer Science. I have tried applying for scholarships but I never get any response.",
            "I'm a junior in college looking for a part-time job now and I'd like to know if my personal income will have an impact on my financial aid package. Currently, I receive enough money from both the Pell Grant and TAP Grant to make up the cost that my merit-based school scholarship doesn't cover. I saw from this [link](https://www.collegedata.com/resources/pay-your-way/how-student-and-parent-income-affects-your-financial-aid#:~:text=Currently%2C%20the%20FAFSA%20protects%20dependent%20student%20income%20up,couple%20with%20two%20children%20in%20college%20is%20%2425%2C400) that FAFSA protects dependent students' income up to $6,660. Is this info accurate? If it is, does that mean I can make a maximum of $6,660 annually without it impacting my financial aid package?",

It\u2019s a number that I can\u2019t seem to find where it came from. Also to my knowledge, I wouldn\u2019t have access to that money. Is it just money that could\u2019ve been used for classes?",

            "My EFC score when my parents completed the FASA form was 206096. I understand that its an estimate but my mom only makes 110k a year after tax and my dad is retired. I dont understand how such a figure could be possible counting that my mom only make 110k a year for a family of 4. There must be something wrong here because I looked up normal scores that correspond with our income and its says the average for 100k a year is an EFC score of 20k.",

However, I realize that FAFSA only counts the 2 years before. Next year (2022-2023) will be my junior year. If I work as many hours as I want starting now, will my financial aid for senior year (2023-2024) be unaffected?",

Now I know that it's a student thing and I don't think there was an actual card in it but now I'm confused? It says my tuition is paid and I don't owe anything (I was paying out of pocket while my financial aid was processing) so that's good but I'm just scared that this envelope contained important information and I just threw it out lol.

            "I have a complex situation I'm hoping y'all can help with: \nI enrolled in college directly after high school in 2018. Went to school from fall 2018 until fall 2020. I had to leave school due to personal and family issues (mostly dealing with undiagnosed ADHD, which is now diagnosed, and my mom's severe alcoholism, which she has since gotten help with). \n\nBefore, my grants and minimal federal loans were paying for my expenses quite well, but when my moms alcoholism started getting bad, there happened to be an issue with my FAFSA and some missing tax information. I tried getting my mom to help me find the appropriate tax forms but she was always too incapacitated and I had no clue what I was looking for or how to get it, so it all ended up on the back burner. \n\nI tried contacting the school during February or March 2021 and they said it was too late, I was no longer considered a student and therefore would be ineligible to get federal aid or aid through the school to pay off my outstanding balance of $10k. \n\nNow it's been 2 years, I've been working really hard on fixing my personal and family issues and I'm ready to go back hopefully summer of 2023. I already plan on calling my schools admissions and financial aid offices tomorrow, but is there anything you could recommend I do?? Would it be worthwhile to try looking into maybe grants or scholarships available to children of alcoholic parents? Also, could I use private loans from like CollegeAve to backpay what I owe from 2020? Any advice is greatly appreciated, this has been a major struggle for the last two years and I'm finally ready to take my education back and finish my degree!! For reference I am in Indiana. \n\n**Tl;dr** had some tax issues that affected FAFSA, alcoholic (now recovered) mom couldn't help me submit it all in time so I became ineligible for aid. Owe the school $10k. Trying to get finances back in order now so I can go back to school in 2023. Thank you!!",

My late payment fee is $15, and my set up fee is $25, if that matters at all. \n\nAlso, additional question: \n\nI spoke w/ a woman at the Finacial aid office for my school; she says once I pay the $300+ out of pocket, I will receive a refund for it/get that money back from my Fed. Pell Grant ($6.4K). I asked if it\u2019s guaranteed that I will receive the $300+ back once the Grant has been authorized (which apparently takes 3-4weeks), and she said yes. Is this true?

I have never received notice of this and this is the first I'm hearing of it. Would this affect my FAFSA filing or will I be fine if I input my tax information from the copy of what I had submitted?

By transfer, I mean actually changing universities, not just an exchange program. Anyhow, I am very unsure of how much financial aid I could potentially qualify for. I've done my research and know that MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, Yale and Columbia cover 100% of demonstrated financial need and Cornell covers most (for international students). Now, let's put aside whether or not I actually have a shot at getting into one of these universities, that's a future me problem.\n\nMy parents make AU$170 000, about US$110 000 per year at the current exchange rate. Other than a pretty normal car, we do not own anything that would qualify as an asset. I have two sisters (we are a family of five) and both of them are younger than me, in fact one of then will start uni in less than four years too and she's looking to apply to Harvard. The issue is that there is a huuuge housing crisis in Australia, to the extent where we have been basically forced to buy a house after essentially getting kicked from our rented home, and so my parents are now stuck paying over AU$2 700 every month. There's also the problem of the home loan repayment being over 30 years, and my dad retires in only 16. My mum's job is also very unstable, she's a private cleaner which is very physically-demanding and her health is already deteriorating. So, they need to be paying quite a lot more than that to  I also have a disability - my eyesight is horrible, about 30/200 with glasses which is barely above the US standard to be considered legally blind, and I have type-1 autism. I don't know if this would make me eligible for some other sort of bursary as well.\n\nThe thing is, my parents pretty much refuse to pay any considerable fees for my studies, which I sort of understand since 1) they can't really afford to with the home loan and without compromising my two sisters and 2) they kind of just think that if I want to do this sort of thing I should be the one paying for it. So I just want to know about how much financial aid I would qualify for, to know if transferring is even an option at all. I know that if I got an offer from one of these universities and then had to turn it down after finding out I simply can't pay for it, well, let's just say my mental health would take a big blow. \n\nAny help will be much appreciated :)",

This is why students need to vouch to legislators because how can someone be denied aid at age 18, yet are eligible to go to a War and possibly die, or get married at 18 and still carry on those, legal adult responsibilities?\n\nThere are ways around this but it is ridiculous.\n\n`are older than 21 but not yet 24,`\n\n`are unaccompanied,`\n\n`and are eitherhomeless or self-supporting and at risk of being homeless`\n\n`In an abusive living situation`\n\nThese are the requirements in order to prove to FASFA that you are an adult and that you qualify for grants and loans provided through FASFA, regardless of the hypocrisy that I mentioned above.\n\nI was in the same situation OP was struggling to below-supporting myself with a part-time job and much difficulty finding a full-time and having idiotic parents refusing to submit their information to FASFA because they were spooked that they would own a loan to the government for it.\n\nFamily members should not have this much power over young people's lives. Once your 18, the necessity of needing a 'parent' is cut off anyway, so why do these adults suddenly need their parents for loans and FASFA? This backward thinking of still treating 18 year olds like minors under mommy and or daddy's roof is the reason why so many people like the OP and myself get denied to go to college, aka, denied a ability to get a higher-paying salary rake and a job, a skill, and a networking opportunity because the FASFA is allowed to use age-discrimination by having the student reliant on the parent's information, even though they are technically and legally, an adult.\n\nSome people have had horrible family members and even worst, and they are suppose to still 'rely' on these people as the government is concerned? What if they are like OP and don't care about their adult child's future, and simply don't want to submit their information, or are abusive? There is no difference in maturity between age 18 and 24. All this does is deny people the ability to get an education, and making sure those who parent's provide information, do. The very actions that they can get away with this is age discrimination, and that isn't just reserved for people 50+ or older. It can work both ways.",

You are surrounded by a lot of smart people you can learn from, but as a result, there is a lot of competition when it comes to doing research with professors, who are also at the top of their field and less willing to work with average students as they see it as an inefficient use of their time.",
            "I went to an Ivy. First, the competitive nature was legitimately too much, most everyone I know was on drugs (prescription and otherwise) to deal with the stress/anxiety as well as uppers to stay up and study for longer. The expectations were just completely unreachable and unrealistic. It\u2019s just that the highly competitive nature of the whole school made it seem that unless you had a perfect gpa and the perfect internship you weren\u2019t good enough to be there.\n\nSecond, the entitlement from a lot of people going there was horrific. I came from a severely underprivileged high school where the school didn\u2019t even have the resources to buy textbooks, so going from that to an Ivy was jarring. Most people at Columbia were relatively wealthy, and if you weren\u2019t, the school admin did not know how to help you. For example, my fianc\u00e9e, who was also a Columbia student, was working at a lab over the last summer and was paid in the form of a stipend. (This is a specific example of an issue that unfortunately reared its head over the course of my time at Columbia) The university gave her the run around every time she was supposed to get paid and did everything in their power to not pay her. It was ridiculous. It got to the point that we had to lawyer up for the university to actually pay her, and even then, the stipend was always at least a month late. When she called the university\u2019s financial department for the billionth time and insisted she needed the money for rent or she\u2019d be evicted, they just said \u201cOh.\u201d I ended up having to cover her rent with money I didn\u2019t have so she wouldn\u2019t be super late on rent (she later paid me back ofc) but the fact that something like that had to happen was ridiculous. We just figured that most people getting paid on a stipend might not necessarily need it, so when the university was met with a student that actually needed the money to live, they were genuinely surprised and didn\u2019t have anything in the way of help.\n\nI\u2019m sure you can tell from my rant I have a lot of grievances, but the ones I listed above are definitely the ones that bothered me most.

I'm co-authoring a publication with a professor right now because she specifically came to me because she knew my work ethic and interests. I could also just sign up as a volunteer health promoter because not enough students apply to make it competitive. At a giant university, I would've had to compete with tons of other students with more experience than me to do either of those things. \n\nAs you said, maybe it's less prestigious, but for grad school applications, a student from a small school with two pubs, a thesis, research experience, and volunteer experience looks better than a student from a prestigious school with the same grades who doesn't get to do any of that because the opportunities were harder to come by. \n\nI find it funny because \"fewer opportunities\" is frequently listed as a con for small schools. Sure, there are fewer options, but it's easier to grab hold of the ones that are there.

Chances are, it won't be.\n\nCollege will have your best interests at heart. You are seen more as a gateway to the money they want, you can use this to your own advantage and utilize college to get to the next step in life or you can go into college, fuck off a bit, start failing, and then realizing nobody is there to pick you up and nobody really cares.\n\nYou are going to make a bunch of friends. You will most likely Not make a bunch of friends. I'd say 1/3rd of college related posts on reddit are \"how to make friends?\" - honestly, if your college is close to your hometown you might be surprised how much time you spend at home with the same high school friends.\n\nA 4 year degree only takes 4 years at a modest pace. It usually takes 5 years.\n\nYou can follow the rules and come out ahead as long as you are smart and just do your work. Professors see you more as a gnat, or a pest, than anything else. Their goal is to get money, and get through the week, and then get through the semester, and move on without hassle. One of the quickest things people realize is that nobody is going to open your emails asking for help, nobody is going to respond, there really is no such thing as office hours. At some point, you will realize this is all just a business venture... no different than going into Target, buying a bottle of shampoo, paying, and walking out.\n\n\"Not having to show up to class\" is old school - attendance is required and part of the grade.\n\nCollege will allow you to become more social and reinvent yourself.

            "1. Failure is an option. High schools very often will bend over backwards to get people to graduate. Very few college classes are going to make those sorts of allowances. Most classes aren't very difficult if you simply do the work, but if you choose to not do the work (and that includes doing the readings, showing up to class, paying attention, taking notes, etc) then you stand a pretty good chance of failing, even if other people have passed without doing the work.\n\n2. Your professors do not work for you, you don't pay them to do anything. They work for the department and for the university. That's who hires them, fires them, and cuts them a paycheck.\n\n3. Your in-class time is a small fraction of the total work you'll do. If you're on a normal semester system taking 15 credit hours, you'll only be in class 12.5 hours a day. But, you should make a schedule that has you working on school work about 40 hours a week. That's time you'll spend reading for the next class, doing homework, reviewing notes, etc. When you find yourself only having done about 10 hours of work outside of class with seemingly nothing else to do, go back over your notes, do the readings again, and get a head start on your upcoming larger assignments.\n\n4. College should be more than a full-time job. You may hear people talk about putting in 40 hours a week as being equivalent to a full time job, but you should think of yourself not as an employee, but an entrepreneur. If you were starting a small business, you wouldn't stop at 40 hours a week, and instead would be working something 60+ hours a week. This isn't all school work though. You should be doing things like joining student organizations and attending on-campus events like guest lectures. A lot of this stuff can be very enjoyable. Make friends within your major, especially ones that enjoy discussing what you're studying.",

Also get used to spending more money than you think. There are always like little things you need.

            "Thank you for sharing your story! I worked as a peer mentor for a little while and a few of the students I worked with had similar experiences. I am glad it is better this time.\n\nI also went right into school. I had undiagnosed autism at the time and the burnout was so severe that I re-took junior level classes twice or three times and then eventually have discontinued my education after 5 years of study and no degree. The debt is too great, and the mental damage is taking a long time to heal.\n\nAnother common story is that people get to college and then realize they don't have a goal, interest, or passions. It is my opinion that the best thing to do for those people is anything other than paying for school.",

            "I agree, there\u2019s so many immature students at some colleges. Hell, *some* Greek orgs you essentially pay to be bullied. I\u2019m not trying to bash Greek life if that\u2019s what folks are into, and not all Greek orgs are that low, but they can foster middle school drama and toxic environments if you aren\u2019t careful. Someone at my college made an instagram \u201cmatchmaker\u201d page to ship random college students together in typical middle school fashion. College just makes it a lot easier to distance yourself and mind your own business as some people never mentally peak past high school.",

            "I understand that you as an individual might be different, but this was my experience and the consensus among most students. It's not necessarily a bad thing or a character defect of the professor. In high school the students are the teachers top priority. Its not the same undergrad and beyond. \n\nA high school teacher will pay attention to your performance. They will pull you aside for underperforming. They will call your parents. They will make you deals, try to meet you half way, give you opportunities to redo things, remind you things are due, remind you about tests, readily adjust due dates and such for you. \n\nThis is very uncommon in college. If you don't show up to class, no one is going to hunt you down to figure out why. If you are failing no one is paying attention. You're just going to fail. The best you will get is maybe a comment on your work to come to office hours. If you don't see it or you don't go nothing happens. I want the incoming undergrads to understand they are not the center of the universe anymore like in high school. A university has a lot more important things going on then random undergrads. It's a big place and you're an insignificant drop of rain into the ocean. No one is losing sleep over you.",
            "Yeah, that\u2019s really it. When the professor openly says they know what you\u2019re doing with at-home online exams then no, I don\u2019t consider that some form of cheating. I used to care about this shit until grade inflation took over my college and the dude who skipped the final gets passed while I\u2019m working, busting my ass studying, and responsible for an injured relative at home.",
            "The book smart people who had to decide to learn on their own due to neglectful parents are an exception. A lot of them can pull through hard stuff.\n\nThe kids who performed well because their parents set a study schedule for them and were constantly asking about due dates are most at risk. The adult version of that is called a personal assistant and you don't get one of those as a college student.",
            "The difference, though, is that while high school teachers are likely legally obligated to deal with the parents, US college instructors are legally *not* allowed to share info with parents without permission. \n\nAnd we don't. \n\nFor those with helicopter parents in the United States, some vital info:\n\nFERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) determines who has the right to access educational info (this sometimes includes medical info if treatment is done through the school). Parents or guardians have the right to access education records for minor children, but once a student begins college courses, the right goes only to the actual student. *This includes those who are minors at the time college classes start.*. Even if you're taking college courses while in high school, your college instructors can't share your info. \n\nStudents can sign a form giving instructors permission to share info, but this is permission, not obligation, and most professors still won't. I'll personally only speak with those enrolled in my classes. I don't get paid enough to deal with helimom drama, and if my students are intimidated by a controlling parent, I'm fine being a shield. \n\nIf you have a controlling parent and think your parents will nag or intimidate you into signing the form, contact your professors and simply say, \"My parent might contact you to ask for my information. I do *not* give permission. Even if I sign the form granting permission, please do not share my information with my parent.\"\n\nThis happens so often that most professors will understand and will act accordingly. We will not think less of you. We will not blame you, so don't hesitate to speak to us if you think there will be a problem. \n\nKeep in mind, though, that your helicopter parents may convince a student worker in admin or some other department to cave, though they're not allowed to share info, either...but your professors are extremely unlikely to do so, and not just because we really, really don't want to deal with parents.",

            "Huh. Actually surprises me, I always heard things about classes like organic chem being super hard in that major.   \nI was expecting an answer more like history (not to shame it) since those classes usually run like - if you turn in your paper 3 papers, they meet the length requirements and stay on topic, it's an A.",

            "I didn't think you were attacking professors or anything, and I'm not denying that some professors genuinely don't care, but for the majority of us, the students are absolutely the priority. I'm certainly not in this job for the pay. \n\nThe difference lies in how \"caring\" is interpreted. Students with the high school mentality often think caring is about making allowances and offering more chances when the students fail.  At the college level, it's about ensuring students are ready--ready for the next level course, ready to enter their fields, ready for jobs and responsibilities and life in general. \n\nThe majority of my students are legal adults. When they're done with their college courses, they're going to begin their careers, maybe get married, maybe have kids. The level of allowance given by many high schools is completely detrimental to all of that, because their future bosses aren't going to keep extending deadlines or make deals when responsibilities aren't met. Kids don't meet parents halfway, and spouses who need constant reminders aren't usually considered ideal partners. \n\nAt the end of the day, I'd rather a student fail my class than continue to the next stage without being sufficiently prepared, because real life doesn't usually give multiple chances. Harsh as it may seem, it's infinitely better to learn this lesson with a class that can be repeated than to continue expecting allowances into adulthood.",
            "No joke!",
            "Lmao. The guy is right, most courses are not giving back the same value of your investment. The paper you receive in the end is. University teachers usually suck at teaching, the syllabus is too much for the time you have to actually be learnt properly and attending classes just suck in general.",
            "I see it more as you're paying for the grade. You can get the exact same things you mentioned, but just going to the class without registering. Or find the same materials online.",
            "Well it started towards the beginning of my sophomore year. I chose digital arts because as a child I\u2019d always dreams of working in the animation industry but over the years I had been drawing less and less. And got more and more anxious about the financial prospects of the career.\n\nSo I was frantically looking for new career and was like \u201cummm what can I do? Nursing!\u201d so I jumped into the prerequisites for that. And when it came time to talk to my advisor she asked why I wanted to be a nurse and I didn\u2019t want to say money or 3 day work week so I mumbled some not so convincing answer. She suggested I look into the respiratory therapy program. I ended up speaking to the program coordinator of the respiratory program and he really sold me on it. Also it had everything that the arts couldn\u2019t guarantee. A three day work week, financial stability, and job security because there\u2019s a growing need for RTs. \n\nI also just really enjoyed the prerequisites for it so I think I made the right choice.",
            "I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s fairly priced. I\u2019m saying that\u2019s what you usually get in return.\n\nAnd whether or not it\u2019s a return on investment is up to how you decide to use your time in college."
