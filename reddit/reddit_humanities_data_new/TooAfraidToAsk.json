Because Reddit is a leftist totalitarian app that only allows ideas that are either leftist or neutral. Anything remotely traditional is cutt off not because it's disrespectful or wrong but because the moderators just don't like it. Funny how this is still a \"free\" and \"open\" environment. All it took is for me to state the FACT that tomboy princess movies have all flopped except Mulan, which isn't even a recent movie, and that's because the audience that likes princesses are girly girls and trying to make a tomboy princess is the same as making a girly Spiderman.

And they hide in the  civilian population.  Then they actively plot to kill you, but are hidden in their civilian population.  What is your solution?",
            "I've seen a lot of deserved criticism around Israel's treatment of Palestinians, but why does no one discuss Hamas's treatment of Palestinians?\n\nIsrael are bombing civilian areas because Hamas are hiding in civilian areas. Israel are bombing aid trucks because Hamas are smuggling weapons in aid trucks. The war is ongoing because Hamas started and continue to consent to the most recent war.\n\nYou can say that this doesn't justify Israel's actions, but 1. it complicates them legally at the very least, and 2. the fact remains the behaviour of the two arr inextricably linked. If you wanna ask why a civilian was bombed, \"there was a Hamas leader right next to them who organised crimes against humanity on Oct 7th and poses a continued threat to Israel's national security\" is pretty CRUCIAL context.\n\nI don't want to tolerate what Israel are doing. I don't want what's happening to ever be okay. Regardless of anything, they are at least 50% at fault which is deplorable in its own right. But this feels like a huge elephant in the room which everyone refuses to acknowledge is there.

He basically lost the young voters at this point, and none of them will help out with the electoral ballots after everything that\u2019s happened after October 7 either.\n\nPersonally, I think Biden\u2019s been a monster and an idiot through this whole ordeal and I don\u2019t want to vote for him, but what are we supposed to do to stop Project 2025 from happening now? None of the third party candidates seem like they have a chance of winning, the electoral college won\u2019t help either way, and the only viable option at this point seems to either be moving to another country to escape Project 2025.

However, I\u2019m still terrified about Project 2025 and so far no one is mentioning another way to stop it from happening besides voting for Biden, so what are we supposed to do?\n\nAlso, sorry if this is the wrong place to ask.

Yes, the US also has significant influence from, and ties to other nations, such as Germany, Italy, and Ireland, etc. And the US and UK did stand with each other through two world wars and the subsequent cold war. \n\nBut recently I have heard it said more and more that it is Israel that is America's greatest ally and not just the greatest ally _in the Middle East_.

Iran\u2019s own government isn\u2019t even claiming as such and the weather conditions they were flying in were very poor. \n\nHowever, last year, when Russia's most powerful mercenary, Yevgeny Prigozhin, led a mutiny against the Russian military, he mysteriously died in a plane crash two months later. The Kremlin denied they were behind the crash and the world had little to no proof, yet most people believe that the crash was really a KGB plot to assassinate Prigozhin as retaliation for his actions against the Russian state. \n\nWhy then is it so unthinkable that the death of Iran\u2019s president under similar circumstances might also be suspicious? \n\nAgain, I\u2019m not saying I think Isreal was behind the crash - I couldn\u2019t possibly say that as I have no idea what caused the crash and nor does anyone.

            "This is a really great and important question.  Much of the protests aren't about pushing or advocating for policies that will actually create a long term peace or address the core issues.\n\nSince we're discussing this on Reddit, we'll skip over the long history of Israel and Palestine.  But there are a few points that we should review.  First, Hamas is a puppet government of Iran and Gaza is not a democracy.  Second, Israel has repeatedly tried a \"light touch\" when dealing with Hamas in the past and that has never lead to a lasting peace or a fruitful relationship.  Finally, no Islamic, Arab, Persian, or Turkic nation actively wants to help the Palestinian cause or give the Palestinians land because every time that has happened in the past it has only spelled disaster for the host country.\n\nWhat options does that leave us?  Realistically, the only options left open are one that no one will support and one that only the Israeli's support.\n\nA two-state solution *could* be possible but the ugly truth is that anyone that supports Hamas cannot be part of it.  Hamas is a governing entity that openly has a policy position of exterminating all Jews from the face of the Earth.  That is not tenable for two-state solution.  To make a two-state solution work Israel would need to:\n\n1. Imprison every male currently living in Gaza between the ages of 10 and 80.\n\n2. Relocate every woman and remaining male out of Gaza and into the West Bank.  This could be done by ceding territory roughly the size of Gaza to the West Bank enclave (governed by the PLA) in exchange for Israel taking direct control of the land of Gaza.  A land swap would be needed to house the Gazan refugees.\n\n3. Grant statehood to the Palestinians in the West Bank and allow a council of Arab states to be security guarantors of the new Palestinian homeland.  Normalized relations or trade deals could be used to incentivize this.\n\nYou can easily see how no one involved would sign off on any of this.  There will be no two-state solution.\n\nThe most likely end of this war is a 3-4 year campaign to destroy Hamas by leveling every major town and city in Gaza until the Gazans themselves opt for surrender.  The IDF will be an occupying force in the region for several years as they continue to destroy Hamas infrastructure and top leadership.\n\n*If* Israel had fully normalized relations with Saudi Arabia and other Arab states before October 2023, a two state solution would have been possible.  But Iran wanted to make sure that normalization will not happen.  In that they have succeeded.  And it will be the Gazans who pay the heaviest price for Iran's victory.",

            "> Why are people so angry at Jewish people in America?\n\nGenerally speaking, they're not. Look at the House of Representatives\u2014overwhelmingly they're concerned about antisemitism, but they still deny that anti-Arab prejudice even exists. Or worse, they use it as a means to pander to their constituents.\n\nMany Americans *are* angry at *Zionism*, a collection of ideologies which fuel several complicated political trends in the Middle East, Europe, North America, Australia, and other places around the world. For example, [Zionism instills the idea in Israeli settlers](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-extreme-ambitions-of-west-bank-settlers) that they have a right to simply kill Palestinians and take their homes. (You will note from that article that in fact, settlers' notion of Zion includes other countries which they expect to eventually belong to Israel\u2014e.g., Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, etc. No wonder Israel's neighbors are always so concerned.) Zionism also informed the [Likud charter](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/31/from-the-river-to-the-sea-where-does-the-slogan-come-from-and-what-does-it-mean-israel-palestine) (Likud is the party of Netanyahu) which asserts \u201cBetween the sea and the river there will only be Israeli sovereignty\u201d (echoing West Bank settlers' refusal to allow non-Jewish people the right to vote). If you look at the Likud charter, by the way, you'll notice that they explicitly characterized Palestinian resistance as malicious\u2014something which the US government did to Native Americans repeatedly from the beginning.\n\nI hope it's clear from the above that there are legitimate reasons for people (whether they're American or not) to be upset about at least *some* of the ideologies that Zionism comprises. But on top of that, it has impelled what critics of the military industrial complex call *forever war*. The invasion of Iraq, for example, was based on \"ambiguous\" intelligence (now known to have been lies) for its justification to the public. Many of those lies were laundered through mainstream media, exemplifying what is called [*securitization discourse*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securitization_(international_relations). Actually, *all* US involvement in the Middle East has been accompanied by expansive public relations campaigns conducted by Israel-aligned media figures such as Bush speechwriter David Frum, hawkish Israel-first PACs like AIPAC, and Israel-first think tanks like the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Without the PR, the US public (like any public) naturally resists war.\n\nUnfortunately, securitization discourse tends to stoke right-wing political movements such as those which have risen globally since the 2000s. The wars, the government rhetoric, and the right wing politics, therefore, are all bound up in the situation between Israel and Israel's neighbors.\n\nSo:\n\n* (Some) Zionisms cause ongoing conflict between Israel and its neighbors.\n  * There is history here, and it's important; nonetheless, what stands in the way of a peace process today is the mindset of Israeli politics, which *is* fueled by Zionism in the style of Likud. We know this because *stopping the peace process* was literally Likud's purpose in the 2005 Disengagement Plan; PM Sharon's own government said so. They could replace Netanyahu tomorrow and his successor would likely have the same right-wing expansionist beliefs, predicated upon the kind of Zionism professed in the Likud charter. The Hamas attack isn't the root cause of all this. It's been going on since the beginning of Israel in the mid-20th century.\n* Because Israel depends upon the US for weapons and other aid, Israelis lobby the US government via the Israel lobby (which includes PACs like AIPAC).\n* US politicians receive money from AIPAC etc., and in exchange, they do several things:\n * write legislation that benefits Israeli citizens and Israeli businesses;\n * give Israel material support (not even required to be offset in the budget, as is normally done for domestic spending\u2014America goes into debt to give material support to Israel);\n * build support for military spending and military action to suit Israel's interests.\n* The conventional wisdom in Washington is that none of these is *necessarily* wrong or even controversial *in theory*. (I think quite a lot of people would disagree, if they were asked.)\n* In practice however, there is always more to consider.\n * The US effectively gives taxpayers' money to Israel. Israeli citizens have the right to public healthcare, education, and other benefits which have been systematically *stripped* from citizens in the US over the last several decades. (The warhawks have their own rationalizations for this\u2014all of them fairly tenuous arguments about US interests and how Israeli citizens serve them\u2014but again, quite a lot of people would disagree with those rationalizations if they were asked. Do US citizens not serve US interests?)\n * This state of affairs causes resentment on its own, for obvious reasons.\n * But also, when people don't have healthcare and education, their society suffers. Believe it or not, illiteracy and innumeracy kill. Political extremism and casual violence grow when people don't know history, geography, science, etc., and when people are subject to increasing *austerity*. (People have less time to worry about their communities and the needs of others, including their children, when they need to work several jobs just to afford lifesaving medicine, pediatric care, etc.)\n * The right-wing character of Israeli politics means that Israel's effect on American politics has been, largely, to push them rightward.\n * In both Israel and the US, securitization discourse has profoundly altered the attitudes of the public toward concepts like human rights, war, international cooperation, religion, history, education, climate change and the environment, financial regulation, the immorality and harms of colonialism, even the usefulness of democracy itself\u2014the list goes on and on. Securitization discourse produces right-wing fervor and leads to a loss of democracy normally *anyway*; but this situation is *exacerbated* by what I mentioned before (the destruction of public education, etc. austerity measures).\n\nEzra Klein can blather on about polarization and tribalism all he wants. At the end of the day, though, what makes people nervous about *today* isn't *polarization itself*; polarization has always existed in the US (because of its political system and its economy, *not* just because of innate \"tribalism\"). It's the expanded realm of \"scary ideas discussed as acceptable\" promoted by US media and officials. And these things are only treated as \"acceptable\" by Washington and New York because of the pressures of Israel's situation, on the one hand (which is again, caused in the first place by Zionism); and the slate of giant war corporations which blend eerily with the US military in their own separate feedback loop. And these scary ideas are the reason the US parties have torn up democratic processes every decade since WWII ended. (Which is why, for example, **three successive presidential elections** have been between candidates whom most of the country did not want).\n\n***\n\nI should mention this: not all Zionisms are the same. And then there are post-Zionisms, non-Zionisms, anti-Zionisms\u2014none of them is homogeneous. But one thing which all Zionisms have in common is the belief that Jews (however we define \"Jews\") have the right (whatever \"right\" means) to live in Israel (whatever we think \"Israel\" is). \n\nBut you asked why people are angry\u2014they're not angry at Jewish people *as such*; they're angry at the kind of Zionism practiced by the current Israeli government and promoted by most American Zionist organizations. I believe I covered several reason above. One more deserving mention is that **Zionism is giving cover to the genocide in Gaza**. That bothers people who believe in human rights.\n\nWhat's the point in living in a world where it's perfectly acceptable to destroy *universities*, *libraries*, *playgrounds*, and *innocent people*\u2014and where your government privatizes your kid's high school, imprisons kids in privately-owned for-profit prisons where they're made to work like slaves, conducts mass surveillance, criminalizes protest, takes a cut of your wages and then gives it to the extremist government of another country where it's used to give education to the children of extremists, imprison Palestinians for years without trial, support apartheid in Gaza, build surveillance technology used to [ruin the lives of American students in their own country](https://truthout.org/articles/israel-has-formed-a-task-force-to-carry-out-covert-campaigns-at-us-universities/), [conduct psy-ops on Gazan civilians](https://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/4758/Punishing-journalists:-Israel-extorts-Palestinian-journalists,-bans-them-from-traveling---new-report), and [intimidate internationial courts](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/28/spying-hacking-intimidation-israel-war-icc-exposed)?\n\nWe have here not just one, but several governments implicated in massive human rights abuses across the world, including sustained attempts to undermine international organizations whose foundational principle, in the wake of two catastrophically violent world wars, is to adjudicate when individual governments backslide in their obligations to their human subjects.

            "I'm a bisexual atheist leftist, and occasionally speak in the defense of Islam, and perhaps I can shed a little light, if you don't mind a late reply.\n\nFirst, it is a popular idea on the left that all oppression is interlinked. Fighting against, say, racism, is part of fighting for LGBT rights. Solidarity is the idea, solidarity among all oppressed groups. Second, attacks on Islam are often proxies for racism, pitting \"our\" religion, Christianity, against \"their\" religion, and lending an air of religious righteousness to racism and far-right thought, sometimes very obliquely. Third, it's about fighting collective punishment in general. You hopefully acknowledge that at least *some* Muslims are progressive and pro-LGBT (and LGBT themselves, for that matter)? Then this comes in part down to not causing trouble for that minority of believers for what other believers, even if they are a majority, do. For the thread we're in, you might see parallels with \"every Palestinian in Gaza is Hamas\". A lot of us on the left see these parallels a lot of places, and want the pattern of thought gone.\n\nIdeally I would prefer religion to die out, as I think most religions are drivers of bigotry and oppression, along with a lot of other social ills. But if religion is here to stay, as it seems, I would much rather have the progressive and accepting parts of each religion than the far-right parts that use the religion for hate. This fight is not over for either Christianity or Islam, though I'll tentatively agree it is further along in Christianity, despite setbacks. Today most Christians are probably in favor of women teaching or being in positions of authority. And even if we can eventually eliminate religious thought, it seems much more likely that we can achieve this through first making religions more open-minded. Treating Islam as categorically anti-LGBT gives power to the anti-LGBT parts of Islamic thought. There *are* dissenting voices, though oppressed and diminished, and by acting like they don't exist, or are incompatible with the religion, we would be contributing to their erasure and silencing within the faith.\n\n*No* thought is incompatible with *any* religion, because religion is not consistent and every believer, no matter how orthodox they claim to be, is eclectic to some degree.",

Hamas was formed in the late 80s as an offshoot the Muslim Brotherhood that believed in armed and more violent resistance against Israel than what other governing Palestinian parties believed at the time. It's true that part of Hamas original charter stated its goal was the complete annihilation and destruction of Israel. The government of the Palestinian Authority was increasingly seen as inept and corrupt by Gazans as their ability to properly govern the strip and support it from the West Bank was hampered by their geographic division. Seeing this distaste towards the PA, Hamas ran as an official party in the 2006 elections and won governing control of the Gaza Strip. Hamas and its political rivals fought a short civil war in 2007 where Hamas managed to expel the PA and has since ruled Gaza with an authoritarian style. It's also important to note though that there is a lot of evidence that Israel was purposely sabotaging more progressive groups in the Palestinian government which created openings for Hamas to fill, so it's not like Hamas rose independently of Israel. While Gazans have supported Hamas in the past, Hamas has long since become an authoritarian government in the strip and acts with impunity regardless of what civilian Gazans may think",

He did so through a scheme or course of conduct that included soliciting the Government of Ukraine\nto publicly announce investigations that would benefit his reelection, harm the election prospects of a political opponent, and influence the 2020 United States Presidential election to his advantage. President Trump also sought to pressure the Government of Ukraine to take these steps by conditioning official United States Government acts of significant value to Ukraine on its public announcement of the investigations.\n\nThe withholding of aid was evidence used to support the charge that then-President Trump was trying to get Ukraine to play ball.

            "There is a lot to unpack here in this post.  You ask a lot of great questions but they cover a lot of topics.  Let's break it down topic by topic.\n\n**2 Regional Conflicts:**  The US is involved in more than just two regional conflicts.  Just to double your number I'll point out that the US is involved in the conflict with the Houthis in the Red Sea and it is still involved in the ongoing Syrian Civil War.\n\n**China:**  A conflict with China would likely see wide spread support from both parties.  Anti-China sentiment has been growing on both sides of the aisle for about a decade and a half.  There are several reasons for this but the largest ones are related to economic and public health.\n\nChina's foreign policy has an outsized impact on the US economy and we've seen many sectors of the US economy hurt because of Chinese policy.  And most Americans blame the Chinese for the COVID pandemic.  No matter which party controls the White House and Congress, if China attempts to capture Taiwan, the US will go to war.\n\n**Contradictory Foreign Policy:**  I want to bundle the remaining few questions into one group since they can be answered by looking at US foreign policy over the past 30 years.\n\nSince this is a Reddit post, I'll forgo the past 70 years of history and focus on the last 30.  Beginning with  the end of the Cold War the US has become less and less interested in foreign policy and maintaining the global order.  \n\nOnce the existential threat of the Soviet Union was gone, Americans got bored with everything outside of their borders.  The US has allowed all the institutions that support the global order to ossify; many Americans even pushing to abandon them.  The US has been shrinking their military footprint abroad; the current foreign deployment of US troops is at its lowest levels since before World War 2.  And since the fall of the USSR in each presidential race, the American people have voted for the Presidential candidate that was the most disinterested or incompetent when it came to foreign policy.  Until President Biden was elected; though he was elected because the American people thought he could handle a domestic issue (COVID) better than his rival.\n\nWhat little interest in foreign affairs remains in the American people depends on what interests the party represents.  Where each party stands on specific foreign policy issues completely depends on the loudest special interest groups of their constituents.\n\nAs a result, the party's positions on each specific conflict depend on how many votes they can get by adopting position XYZ on conflict ABC.\n\nThese were a lot of great questions that you asked.

But when you're young and insulated in an elite institution, the consequences may not be in the front of their mind or seem too remote.\n\nBut worse, the arrested students will face professional repercussions that they do not yet even imagine. For example, some of the protesters, no doubt, would continue their education beyond Columbia at an American law school and later seek admission to a state bar to practice (this being a common route that persons who seek the tools to effect justice through the courts follow). But those arrests will have to be disclosed to the law school and, more importantly, the state bar examiners - and the legal profession has a very different view of trespassing than humanities professors. This wasn't \"I was in a bar and a fight broke out and I ended up arrested\", which would still be a hassle to explain to the bar examiners. This was \"I knew what I did was illegal, was given multiple opportunities to not do the illegal thing and multiple warnings as to the consequences - and I broke the law anyway\". That is a person who does not possess the relevant character and fitness to practice law, and I think the protesters that seek such a career will be shocked by how tyrannical that process is (i.e., nothing like dealing with the Columbia administration).\n\nThe protesters rely on the presumption that they are the vanguard of history, that in time everyone will consider them heroes - just like their professors who participated in protests in 1968. But that is an immature view only possible on a college campus; the reality is that there are hundreds of millions of people who support Israel and will not be changing their minds on that issue for various reasons. And for some professions (e.g., law), the decision of whether to let someone in with an arrest record ultimately comes down to state supreme courts that are only interested in factual questions (did the applicant break the law? Was the law constitutional? How did the applicant reform themselves and demonstrate appropriate character and fitness after the arrest?). There isn't going to be a moment when the world suddenly agrees to forgive all of the protesters, even if their colleges ultimately do. The protesters who got arrested closed a lot of doors for themselves.

He's rightfully being arrested for collective punishment and the bombing of civilians, but not genocide just yet.\n\nSecond, I acknowledge that this has happened (bombing designated \"safe\" zones), and have seen Palestinians cry in the height of emotion that this must be deliberate targeting. And I see how from their perspective it would appear that way. But this isn't happening systematically. Most of the time, safe zones are safe and they are evacuating civilians effectively (the death toll would be far higher if they weren't, considering how much of Gaza has been destroyed). It just seems to be occasional instances where miscommunication or disorganisation has happened. Which is tragic, but probably also unavoidable.\n\nThe \"Israel are deliberately tricking civilians\" interpretation also neglects the possibility/fact that Hamas will run into safe zones after conducting bombings. File a missile at the Israeli army then run into a refugee camp for shelter. And over the course of the war they have followed their civilians, which is why they have now CHOSE to fight in Rafah despite it being so densely populated there.\n\nAs for the Israeli ministers, this is again very angering, but you also tend to find that in a parliamentary democracy there will be 1. a contingent of far right activists who say inflammatory and downright evil things, and 2. controls in place to limit their influence. Not sure how Israel works but in the UK it really doesn't matter what an MP says as long as they're not in the cabinet. And even under our deplorable, right wing government, they can't actually do anything illegal due to the house of Lords, supreme court, etc. Netanyahu is far right and I do not trust him as far as I can throw him, and the growing influence of far right extremism in Israeli politics is deeply converning, but this doesn't automatically mean that their controls within the army (a separate institution to govt) to adhere to the Geneva convention and other international law have failed.

One person even said that the only viable compromise to vote Biden after everything he\u2019s done is to unalive your children to make up for all the children who were murdered in Gaza\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSo many people are fed up with both politicians in general and feel that the way Biden\u2019s handling things now is no different than what Trump would\u2019ve done if he was president. The fact that Congress created a bill that would deport all of the student protestors to Gaza for \u201ccommunity service\u201d is enough proof.",
            ">\u00a0Sure, maybe there were some kids too young and old people too demented to realize what was happening. But the people of Gaza knew this attack was coming, knew what kind of people were going to be targeted (civilians), knew what would happen to them and did nothing.\n\nWhat were they supposed to do? \"Oh no Hamas don't do that\" those people have no say in anything. You're delusional if you think there was something they could have done.\n\n>If I saw people build a replica of your house and repeatedly practice storming it and taking hostages, what should be my response? Can I reasonably defend the decision to do nothing as \"just wanting to live free\"?\n\n  \nIt's a house I stole; therefore not really my house. They'd be practicing stealing back their house from burglars and taking some other burglars hostages.",

That doesn't make it genocide.\n\nAnd this *is* already happening in Ukraine with Russian troops kidnapping Ukrainian children, targeting civilian infrastructure.  But that's not genocide, it's ethnic cleansing.\n\nWas Dresden or Hiroshima genocide?  No, of course not.  Civilian casualties are a part of war.  War isn't some sanitary thing where only bad guy soldiers die, it's not some kid-glove police action.  Unless you're making the claim that all war is genocide then you need to reassess your position.\n\nScreaming and swearing that it's genocide doesn't make it genocide.  Take a deep breath and think about the implications of what you're saying.  If civilian casualties=genocide then the Allied victory over the Axis powers was immoral and shouldn't have been allowed to happen.",

            "There is literally a separate group from Hamas that is the \u201cFree Palestine Movement\u201d. It\u2019s the first link on Google- pasted what I was referencing for you though. \n\n[Free Palestine Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Palestine_Movement)\n\n\u201cThe Free Palestine Movement was founded by Yasser Qashlaq, a Syria-born Palestinian businessman of considerable wealth who heads several organizations including the Lebanese Institute of International Studies, the Syrian-Palestinian Investment House, the Palestinian Businessmen's Club, and also owns a small Lebanese newspaper.Furthermore, Yasser is known for his antisemitic views, having repeatedly called Jews \"dregs of European garbage\", a \"gang of criminal murderers\",and \"human pieces of filth\"that should be deported to Europe.He has also stated that there is \"no reason for coexistence\" between Israelis and Palestinians, as the latter would reclaim their lands and \"hunt [the Israelis] down to the end of the world, and prosecute them for their massacres\".Though close to the Syrian government, Yasser has denied any links with Hezbollah.\u201d\n\nMaybe I misinterpreting that \u201cfounded by\u201d and had himself stated he still leading it means that\u2026 he leads it?\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not saying the free Palestine movement people identify with is a disingenuous movement, but there has to be some appreciation for the religious motives behind the leaders\u2026. So essentially \u201cfree Palestine\u201d\u2260 sovereign Palestine w/o war, but \u201cliberate Palestine\u201d = peaceful sovereignty \n\nAnd I also am confused you are trying to argue that the sovereignty movement (the not inherently antisemitic movement ) didn\u2019t have individuals taking leadership to respond to issues the Palestinians faced? Like to plan out protests, movements, and retaliations- these aren\u2019t just random and group chatted, people spend hours doing this so I\u2019m confused I guess",
            "Hmm. It may not be exclusively about the territory of Palestine. But according to what I've read of Theodore Herzl and the early writings on zionism, it has the specific objective of a divine right to a Jewish state. 'Self-determination' is a pretty ambiguous term by itself.",

October 7th was a tragedy and inexcusable but it\u2019s a drop in the bucket compared to what Israel has put Palestinians through for the last 75 years and is continuing to do so. Hamas is not representative of Palestinians as a whole and it is not a military or governmental organization, they are fighting a \u201cwar\u201d against an international superpower backed by western countries. Israel claims to want to free the hostages and stop Hamas but continually have declined ceasefire proposals that would free hostages. We don\u2019t even know how many Hamas members they have killed the majority are civilians and women and children. People think that wanting a free Palestine means supporting Hamas, those of us (myself included) who say free Palestine want the occupation to end.

As you can see from a modern map of israel and the west bank, most holy sites are not in israel. They probably chose israel because of the british mandate and how empty it was rather than because of the religous reasons.

Then I felt bad for feeling that way and started to thin, the only reason it bothered me is because I wasn\u2019t used to it. \n\nI asked my wife if she would just not shave as frequently to see how I would feel about it.

And coming home after all of that and finally taking the time to shave everything, you wouldn't believe how nice it felt having truly healthy happy skin!

After I worked through that and a couple other beauty related anxieties my life has been much more peaceful. However I'm imagining myself before I did all that work and absolutely yeah something like this would have ruined my day. The social anxiety from things like this was intense.

Because of this, they also no longer judge when they see other unshaved women out and about - and in my experience, even the women who choose to still shave, are more used to seeing other women with hairy legs and armpits now, so they are less likely to judge than 5 years ago as well. I personally don't even register if another woman near me has shaved legs or not, even in summer shorts.

            "Indeed, what we're discussing here is the phenomenon of sociolinguistic differentiation, where language and its variations emerge as a result of social factors like community, history, and identity. The accent spoken by many African Americans - sometimes referred to as AAVE or Ebonics - is not simply an artifact of history; it's a living, evolving dialect that's as regionally diverse as it is culturally significant. Just as American English is marked by a plethora of regional accents, AAVE has its own internal variety depending on where it's spoken. Moreover, social mobility, education, and integration have blended these accents further, creating a complex linguistic mosaic.\n\n\n\nEducation - or rather, historical lack thereof - certainly played a role in how AAVE developed, as institutional barriers kept African Americans from accessing the same linguistic resources as other groups. But this isn't just about access to education; it's about a community creating and maintaining a linguistic identity that's both distinct and legitimate.\n\n\n\nWhat's fascinating is the current trend of convergence and divergence within AAVE. Young African Americans in urban centers are shaping and reshaping the dialect in real-time, creating sub-dialects that are influenced by their immediate peers while still retaining overarching features of AAVE. On the flip side, in more integrated communities, you might find African Americans whose speech aligns more closely with standard or regional American English with subtle nuances of AAVE.\n\n\n\nTo your last point, while it might sometimes be possible to distinguish someone's racial or ethnic background by their accent within the same region, this isn't always the case, and cross-cultural and cross-racial influence can make such distinctions less clear. As America's cultural tapestry grows ever more complex, we can expect these linguistic boundaries to blur even further, challenging our preconceptions about language and identity.",

The \"Creole Hypothesis\" suggests that AAVE developed from a creole language formed by the contact between African languages and English during slavery. This theory posits that enslaved Africans created a pidgin, which evolved into a creole and then decreolized over time. However, the \"English Origins Hypothesis\" argues that AAVE developed directly from early forms of English spoken by settlers and was influenced by African languages without forming a full-fledged creole. More recently, the \"Substrate Hypothesis\" offers a middle ground, suggesting that AAVE retained persistent influences from African languages within an English framework [oai_citation:1,A Provocation of The Modes of Black Indigeneity | Ethnic Studies Review | University of California Press](https://online.ucpress.edu/esr/article/44/2/41/118429/A-Provocation-of-The-Modes-of-Black) [oai_citation:2,How did AAL develop? | Online Resources for African American Language](https://oraal.uoregon.edu/AAL/Development).\n\nThe linguistic history of African Americans includes influences from many sources, reflecting the diverse origins of enslaved people, who came from various parts of Africa, and interactions with Black Europeans and Indigenous Americans. This complex mix contributed to the development of AAVE and other creole languages within African American communities [oai_citation:3,Black-Indian Relations | Encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/black-indian-relations) [oai_citation:4,Black Native Americans: Facts About Afro-Indigenous Peoples](https://www.powwows.com/black-native-americans-what-to-know-about-afro-indigenous-peoples/).\n\nRegarding the term \"Gen Z language\" being associated with AAVE, it's important to recognize that many elements of contemporary slang and internet speech have roots in AAVE. However, this appropriation often strips away the cultural and racial context, leading to what some describe as a sanitized version that overlooks its Black American origins. This process of cultural appropriation can dilute the significance and contributions of AAVE to broader American culture [oai_citation:5,A Provocation of The Modes of Black Indigeneity | Ethnic Studies Review | University of California Press](https://online.ucpress.edu/esr/article/44/2/41/118429/A-Provocation-of-The-Modes-of-Black).",

You\u2019re misunderstanding the distinctions between linguistic concepts of language, dialect, and accent as they are all different attributes. A good majority of black Americans also code switch from AAVE to Standard American English. An accent isn\u2019t a dialect. BAE is basically a dialect that has heavy creole attributes. AAVE features different accents depending on the region but it\u2019s often-times the same syntax and language rules being applied. Linguistic variation accents, dialects, and languages, although they are interconnected they are distinct from one another conceptually. \n\n2. Your argument basically misunderstands appropriation. The media attributes an entire manner of speaking as \u201cGen Z slang\u201d because it includes terms originating from AAVE as well as unique creations from Gen Z culture. We are talking about language structure + syntax not just words. It\u2019s a cleverly formatted phrase because it quite literally demeans erases and attributes AAVE as just slang words used by Gen Z instead of asking why does Gen Z use AAVE. Do you think acknowledging the differentiating origins to appreciate the cultural contributions of various groups accurately? Your argument downplays abd oversimplifies a complex issue of cultural appropriation by suggesting it is merely a misidentification. Cultural appropriation involves taking elements from a culture, sanitizing or stripping away the original context. There are words created strictly by Gen Zers which includes black peoples and are in the spirit of the times but the structure and language of AAVE is falsely attributed as Gen z slang when it\u2019s just European American kids using AAVE and new slang words. \n\n3.

I worked with some of my Spanish coworkers to find a decent playlist on Spotify to fit the fiesta vibe, brought maracas and sombreros, and we let our workers wear the sombreros on the clock. My manager had asked me to buy sombrero coolers and a cactus wearing sunglasses and a sombrero as well. I didn\u2019t think ANYTHING of it. Just thought it was cute decor and wanted to bring the joy and camaraderie of Latin culture to our store. Our workers loved it! They danced and wore the sombreros and told customers all about it, posted it on social media and everything. I was so excited and proud of my work. However, one of our workers came in and was very visibly upset by the whole display. They kept quiet and to themselves for most the day, and then asked to speak to me in private. I went with them and we talked for around 20 minutes. The associate asked me to talk to them privately and said that there should not have been sombreros and Latin music. They were extremely offended and said there was nothing that related a taco party to sombreros or Latin culture at all. They said if they want a taco, they\u2019ll go to Taco Bell. Not any Latin specific place. They said a couple other people agreed, and that some others called it racist. They said if they were to put it up on social media it would go viral. They said it was nothing against me and that I\u2019m really nice and do hard work, but they just were very offended by the sombreros, music, some decor, and the cactus in particular as well.

Most likely they would not, because they are not JAPANESE, and worse, would have spent most of their life (if in the USA) being confused/associated with JAPANESE and constantly having to explain they are not ASIAN, but not JAPANESE.\n\nThe way to fix it probably would have been to say something like 'I know Tacos don't have anything to do with LATIN AMERICA, this is a MEXICAN themed party.

            "Teeeeeeeeeeeeechnically hispanic includes people from Spain.\n\nBut yes Latin (Latino) means Mexico and the wide majority of Central and South America.",
            "I\u2019m definitely not implying everyone south is Spanish!!! The Spanish worker is Spanish decent. Raised here in America. They haven\u2019t been able to travel to Spain due to money but loads of their family has come down here and they\u2019ve had parties and have generational kind of idea of Spain. I in no way am implying anything about them!! Just what they\u2019ve shared to me.",
            "Correct!! I\u2019m learning so much from this comment section lol. Working on memorizing the differences between all groups (Spanish, Mexican, Latin, etc.) and facts that separate them! One of my coworkers is extremely on the nose on this, she can always guess where someone is from. She\u2019s my bestie, so I\u2019m texting her and we\u2019re talking about it. Shes gonna help me with it too",
            "Born in Latin America:)",
            "No, that's exactly what I'm saying lol. $10 bucks for fast food sodium bomb or $10 bucks for legit tacos that (probably) won't give you heart palpitations. Who knows though. Maybe ops friend lives somewhere completely void of Mexicans or any central American people and \"Latin\" places are serving crap.",
            "Lmao",
            "That\u2019s the thing! We literally didn\u2019t even name it or categorize it to any specific culture!! I was going for a Mexican likeness since it was tacos, but we just called it a fiesta. I didn\u2019t tell anyone it was related to anything. I appreciate you and I\u2019m definitely using this time to do even more research and try to memorize the differences. I don\u2019t wanna make any more mistakes!",
            "That\u2019s what he described tbh!!! So maybe that\u2019s it",
            "I so appreciate this. I\u2019m really trying to. America is supposed to be a melting pot. A place to accept, appreciate, and encourage all races, cultures, diversities. And celebrate them!!! That\u2019s all I want to do",
            "i\u2019m curious, was the person who got offended hispanic?",
            "So yes on the music it is possible that if it was happening in India, people from south or north might get offended but abroad everyone is fine as far as I know. \n\nBeing a north Indian I would be dancing my heart off if Nattu Nattu (the oscar wining) song plays or any other as well",
            "Oh yeah that's why I asked if that worker was actually Spanish!  Chill dude, I'm not judging you at all, what you did was pretty wholesome, too bad one old dude is ruining it for you guys",
            "Oh you had a lil typo and I got lost. We are in agreement! xx",
            "They were born in Latin America :) idk how long they lived there but yea",
            "I\u2019m chill no worries! Sorry I\u2019m an exclamation point kinda gal I use them too much. :)",
            "From the sound of it, your arrangement wasn't racist at all and seeing as how the same coworker had a good time when it was Italian themed, makes me think he doesn't mind a little cultural appropriation, as long as it's not his culture. \n\nBut I'm curious, if the place is throwing a Latin-themed party and there's latin people working there, did anyone think about having one of them set it up? It would still provide a culturally themed party, but give each person an opportunity to present their culture authentically - while also avoiding any sort of risk that any one would end up offended.",
            "Same here! And sorry for calling you dude lol hope things get better with that dude, don't let him bully you and make you think you did anything wrong. You didn't.\n\nHave a great day!!",
            "I\u2019m usually the go-to party planner. As far as I\u2019m aware, they reached out to a couple of our Puerto Rican co workers, but they were too busy to take on the whole party. They helped me with odds and ends and little things, but that was all. I so agree with you though. One of my coworkers would have been PERFECT for the job had my store been willing to back the event up a couple days.",
            "Lmao girls can be dudes!!! No apologies needed. I appreciate you a lot!!! I hope you have a great day too!! \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc"
