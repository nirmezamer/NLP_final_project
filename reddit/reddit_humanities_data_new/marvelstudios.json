It's been 5 years since Endgame (and would be 7 years if this releases in 2026 like planned), and phases 4 and 5 were the only phases without an Avengers film which made them feel more like a bunch of separate projects than a cohesive cinematic universe.\n\nThat said, I hope this is more of a (relatively) small-scale film like Avengers 1 or Age of Ultron compared to Infinity War and Endgame.\n\nA lot of these characters are:\n\n* New (like Shang-Chi, Deadpool, and, Moon Knight). These characters could be a POV character for new audiences.\n* Never or rarely interacted with one another (like Shuri and Doctor Strange, Ant-Man and Starlord, Hulk and Spider-Man, etc). These relationships could make for interesting scenes like when Thor fought Iron Man and Captain America in the forest in Avengers 1.\n\nWe lack the decade-long relationships that formed the core of the Infinity Saga Avengers. The longest relationships are from characters of the same series (like Sam and Bucky), legacy Avengers (like Hulk, Hawkeye, and Thor), or in Spider-Man's case had their relationships possibly snapped out of existence.\n\nI hope we get a relatively small lineup of:\n\n* Shang-Chi and Doctor Strange. The Magic specialists and Shang-Chi can be a new viewers POV character.\n* Shuri/Black Panther and Ironheart. The Tech Specialists and 2 characters who already know each other from Wakanda Forever.\n* Sam Wilson/Captain America and Starlord. The Leaders, with Sam inheriting Steve's role and Starlord bringing his experience from leading the Guardians.\n* Deadpool and Spider-Man. The comedic relief and 2 of the most popular characters. Since Deadpool can break the 4th wall he'd know what happened in No Way Home which may make for a great scene between these 2.\n* Thor and Hulk. The Tanks and 2 of the 3 surviving members of the original Avengers.",

Ironheart's almost certainly not going to reappear.\n* Sam Wilson - Captain America 4 is likely to bomb on The Marvels level, he'll probably be a side character going forward not a lead.\n* Deadpool - Not going to appear in an Avengers movie.  He doesn't work as a PG-13, and it'll reduce audience as people believe Disney's neutering him and feel he's a terrible character at PG-13, destroying the Deadpool brand.  They're going to keep him separate and R rated.\n* Thor - I suspect that turning him into a buffoon has killed all audience interest in the character and I think his brand is burned to the ground.\n* Hulk - I suspect the general audience is disinterested in green Bruce Banner instead of the Hulk.

And as we can see they are still having problems filling the holes where Tony Stark and Steve Rogers used to be. The only Avengers that seem to be moving the hype needle at all are Doctor Strange and Spider-Man (and the Scarlet Witch if she weren't \"dead\"). Shang-Chi is a cool guy we met one time, Carol Danvers just turned in a box office bomb, and Thor and Hulk are both on thin ice at the moment with fans. The world of Black Panther is pretty exciting, but Shuri herself is not exactly A-list MCU. They haven't had the guns to pull the stops out and give us something beyond what a normal film could offer.\n\nI just think considering all this that an Avengers film before 2026 would not have been that good and probably would have made the perception of the MCU permanently damaged. Even the fans who have checked out will come back for Avengers, but if they came back to a mediocre/bad movie it's over. They badly need the X-Men and/or Fantastic Four involved, so the timing looks good on their current track.",

            "Lets be honest the whole direction since NWH has been so messy and sloppy. How many characters are running around in the MCU? Its exploded since Endgame and even that and its predecessor were at the limit of how many characters they could handle at once\n\nI\u2019ll probably get downvoted for this. But they should never have leaned into T.V series as hard as they did. It just spiralled everything out of control, harder to digest and made people like me who are probably on the more casual/medium investment in the franchise to lose interest entirely. I\u2019d seen every movie up to NWH, since then I\u2019ve really only seen Hawkeye and thats it.\n\nThey really needed a hard reset/or a narrowing of focus atleast to start with in this new phase.
