        "content": "Here\u2019s a list of common questions posted that usually have the same solution.\n\n**\u201cWhy won\u2019t my Ethernet cable plug into the weird looking Ethernet jack?\u201d or \u201cWhy is this Ethernet jack so skinny?\u201d**\n-UTP cable used for Ethernet transmission is usually terminated with an RJ45 connector. This is an 8 conductor plug in the RJ series of connectors. You\u2019ll find similar looking jacks which are used to plug in a landline phone. These jacks could be an RJ11, RJ14, or RJ25 which are 4 or 6 wire jacks. This will not work with your RJ45 cable for Ethernet. \n\nRefer to these sources to identify the type of jack you have.\n\nhttps://www.digikey.com/en/articles/understanding-and-specifying-modular-connectors\n\nhttps://www.diffen.com/difference/RJ11_vs_RJ45\n\n**\u201cIs this Ethernet?\u201d or \u201ccan I convert this to Ethernet\u201d or \u201cwhat category cable do I need\u201d**\n-Fortunately many homes built in the 21st century use cat 5e cable and use 2 or 3 of the twisted pairs for phone use. (This is where you\u2019d see the 4 or 6 pin RJ connectors). However not every build used 8 conductor so if you have less than 8 conductors and 4 twisted pairs. You will need to look into other methods of getting your lan from A to B. \n\nAs far as choosing the type of cable you need, look into cat 5e, cat 6, or cat 6a. Building your home network you most likely don\u2019t need cat 7 or 8. If you don\u2019t know the exact reason you need cat 7 or 8 you don\u2019t need them because these standard typically aren\u2019t used to access the internet.\n\nInformation for reference for UTP cabling \n\nhttps://stl.tech/blog/what-is-a-utp-cable/#Different_Categories_of_UTP_cable\n\n**I bought this flat cat 8 cable from Amazon but I\u2019m only getting 50 Mbps**\n\n-Sorry but it\u2019s become a common issue of Chinese companies putting out cable that don\u2019t meet its category\u2019s specs. Try to return it and go to your local store that sells computer stuff and get one there. On top of that cat 7 and 8 patch cable will not do you any good you will not get any benefit even if you are paying for the best internet available.\n\n**Helpful resources:**\n\n[Terminating cables](https://www.truecable.com/blogs/cable-academy/how-to-terminate-an-unshielded-pass-through-rj45-connector)\n\n[Understanding internet speeds](https://www.comparitech.com/internet-providers/internet-and-broadband-terms-explained/)\n\n[Home network structure examples](https://lazyadmin.nl/home-network/home-network-diagram/)\n\n[Wired connection alternatives to UTP Ethernet](https://www.techreviewer.com/tech-answers/moca-vs-powerline/)\n\n[Understanding WiFi](https://www.duckware.com/tech/wifi-in-the-us.html)\n\n\nIf anyone has other FAQs to add I can add that to the post.",

            "A FAQ is a good concept, but yours is already long enough that a typical new poster here won't bother reading it.  \n\nEveryone wants personalized attention, not to poke around a huge FAQ with tons of links and reading that feels like homework.  \n\nEveryone also wants personal confirmation that their problem is not some kind of special exception by having a human review it.  \n\nAny FAQ that's like ten pages or more including links will be read as much as those online \"Service Agreement\" terms everyone auto-agrees to without even a glance.  It's just too idealistic to require every new poster to read a huge FAQ before participating.\n\nA real solution could also be a FAQ teaching people how to Search this sub for previously answered questions, of which just about everything has been covered extensively.  It'd be much shorter, where you list the common problems, and just list the key words to search for (\"moca\", \"access point\", \"Tailscale\", etc.) But that will be completely ignored too.  People want to talk about their issues with a human, not an automated response robot.\n\nAlso, it's weird you chose 50 Mbps as the arbitrary number for a low speed test when 96-100 Mbps due to a bad cable or punch down is by far one of the most posted topics on here.",

In practice, this rarely happens, and instead, you'll get a 1000BASE-T connections that drops frames left and right, leading to slow speedtests and high packet loss.\n\nIn a situation like this, you often get better results by forcing the NIC to autonegotiate at 100Mbps or even 10Mbps.

But I do use a lot of bandwidth and I do need it for work.)\n\nStreams vary greatly in bandwidth but are usually not a lot more than 5-10mbps for most resolutions (even 4K - higher quality streams are more about frame rates and color information than the actual number of pixels). Unless you\u2019re using a higher quality provider or dealing with raws, you should be fine for streaming one or maybe two streams each. More than that will be tricky. Streaming one each and also browsing pages or doing something else may cause at least one of those things to go slower or stutter. 30mbps is probably enough per person for at least medium duty, but it will be trickier the more you want to do simultaneously. \n\nVideo calling is typically 1-3mbps per stream, bidirectional, so you are already sort of low on the capacity for that. If work, school, family, whatever, wants to see you - and especially more than one at a time - that\u2019s going to be an issue. Several of the video calling providers are fairly hip about adjusting streams on the fly for low bandwidth, but your video may drop entirely or become about four pixels, which may cause issues with other parties.\n\nGames are usually not that intense on the bandwidth, but care a lot more about the latency and jitter, which are the time between your computer or console and the server and the change in that time. You may have also heard the time called lag. It\u2019s hard to say how latent any connection will be in advance. Some cable connections are super fast, some are not, some DSL connections are great, some are not, and I\u2019ve even got a fiber connection that is delivering cable internet that is either really decent or really bad depending on the day. If the latency or jitter are high, then most online games will either perform poorly or just kick you out.\n\nThe comments about a good router, smart queues, and Quality of Service (or similar) are important. A good router could keep your traffic organized and your devices playing nicely and sharing with others. A connection that slow would almost demand it. There are plenty of ways to do this and several vendors, including rolling your own, but choose something that matches your comfort level. Other than the flat limits of just straight up putting way more into the pipe than the upload speed will hold (like video conferencing or maybe VPNs), a good router could go a long way toward making this sort of thing possible. \n\nAs to megabits versus megabytes, we lost that war. Every vendor does that now. It\u2019s fine, though, now, since we have 10Gbit and 100Gbit and 800Gbit connections\u2026 just add more bandwidth if you need more. (Expect to pay dearly for the 800, though!)",
            "Ideally 50-100 mbps per person. As others mentioned you need at least 100Mbps, but I'd go for 200-300Mbps.",
            "Damn i have 1000 mbps into the house. Wifi on the phone shows 500 mbps",
            "Yeah video calling won't be a nice experience",
            "Typical spectrum in my area. The fiber guys like FIOS do same up as down (so if it\u2019s 1gb it\u2019s 1gb in both directions). Cable guys at least here concentrate on the down but the up is a fraction of it.\u00a0",
            "Any decent streaming service will automatically lower their bandwidth use if they\u2019re struggling.  I suspect streaming services will step down unless there is absolutely nothing else going on."

Modem is normally passive and cannot have wireless if it doesn't have routing capabilities.\n\nYou are looking for access points, though a lot of router + wireless aps all in one (like Asus) can be configured in a AP mode that disables routing functions."
