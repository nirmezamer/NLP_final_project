But I want to be elsewhere for a while but I\u2019m not looking to find somewhere \u201cbetter\u201d than home\u2014 just different.

I'm planning to relocate to Greece and live off dividends paid by my UAE company to minimize taxes.\n\nI understand that as a non-resident for the first 6 months, I'll only pay a 5% tax on my foreign dividends.\n\n**My question:**\u00a0After 6 months and becoming a Greek tax resident, will these foreign dividends still be taxed at 5%, or will they be considered personal income and taxed under the regular progressive system (up to 44%)?\n\nI know a tax professional could give the most accurate answer, but I was hoping someone on this subreddit might have experience with a similar situation.\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "Evening all,\n\nIn the very early stages of looking into this, so apologies for any obvious questions!\n\nQuick low down on my current situation...\n\nLooking to move from the dump that is the UK to Spain with my partner/wife through the Digital Nomad visa!\n\nOwned a successful Ecom Business in the UK (with 2 other people) for the last 10 years (most of goods are actually produced in Spain incidentally - more on that later). All of the work I do on the business is done remotely...most of the time I work from home although I do employ approx 20 people in warehouse/office roles. If we move I will continue to work on the business 100% (not looking for new work in Spain).\n\nI'm wondering whether first I can apply for a Digital Nomad visa given the above?\n\nIf yes, I'd like to know how the whole income tax system works.  \nI currently earn just over \u00a3100k per year. Breakdown:\n\n* \u00a312,570 (minimum Salary threshold)\n* Plus approx \u00a390k dividend\n* Plus \u00a360k pension\n* The above has been the same for the last 5 years\n\nI've read something about the \"Beckham Law\" where you can be taxed at a preferential rate of 24% for 5 years. Would I be eligible for that? Or is that only if you move to Spain and work for a company within the country?\n\nAs I mentioned, the majority of the products we sell in the UK are made in Spain. I am involved in the purchasing arm, so I'm in daily contact already with our Spanish partners. I have also considered setting up a similar ecommerce site in Spain doing the same thing, I'm not sure whether that would help my case with the Beckham Law part.\n\nAnyway, that's it for now. Questions/tips/advice highly appreciated!\n\nThanks",

Recently I have been living in Italy where I just completed a PhD and following that I was offered a temporary, remote contractor position by a UK-based organization. I want to take advantage of the situation and enjoy the digital nomad life in Asia but I have no idea how I would go about paying taxes. I cut ties with Canada long ago and no longer pay taxes there and I will have spent less than 183 days in Italy so technically I wouldn't be considered a tax resident here either. I'm not planning on staying more than half a year in any one country for the foreseeable future, so would I actually need to pay taxes anywhere?

            "Hi all, happy to join the community :-) I'm planning to transition to a full-time digital nomad lifestyle around the beginning of next year, and I'm looking for some advice on my first base to call home for a month or so. I've done a bunch of research already and it seems like Mexico would be a good choice, especially since I speak some basic Spanish and the weather should be pretty good around January. But does anyone here have recommendations for a good location in Mexico for a first-time DN?\n\nAside from the weather and other obvious considerations like connectivity, some other factors that are important to me are:\n\n* Laid back/easy-going, i.e., not too busy, fast-paced, or crowded\n* Friendly people\n* Close to nature\n* Easy to meet people like locals, travelers, and other DNs\n* Relatively low rent and cost-of-living\n\nIn general, I prefer small towns to big cities, so I probably wouldn't go for somewhere like Mexico City. The two places that seem most promising so far are Oaxaca (city) and Playa del Carmen, but I'm also open to other suggestions. Which of these do you think would be the best fit based on my situation and preferences?",

            "Imho if you want to stay in Greece, just do it for no more than 180 days per year.   \nThe last thing you want is the Greek tax (private) corporation \u0391\u0391\u0394\u0395, get hold of your finances and access to your bank accounts. \n\nIf you become tax resident of Greece, expect to pay the full amount of tax of all your earnings worldwide. Also Greece has prospective income taxes. eg if you have a car is classed as income and up to an amount is added to your tax return. (called \u03c4\u03b5\u03ba\u03bc\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf). If you have enough assets, you might find paying taxes for more than your actual annual income!!!! \n\nIn addition if your income is through a legal entity (limited company etc) you are looking for upfront tax +80% for \"next year earnings\" against that company. In addition to the normal taxes. \n\nThat's why I would advice against becoming tax resident of Greece. Nice country to be 180 days per year, but that's all.",

I never went on an adventure, constantly walked along congested roads, and worked US hours (9pm-4am). I had what many consider a \"horrible time\" but I enjoyed it because it provided when I wanted. An outstanding gym/spa, productive cowork, and professional remote worker community.\n\nIf I were you, I'd look into the niches. For example, one gym will be majority influencers where your follower count matters. Another gym will be spa like with open minded people happy to chat with anyone. This plays out for yoga centers, coworks, meetups, etc. Read recent reviews, look for in depth content, and ask in local groups to get a feel for the \"vibe\".",
            "I'm sorry that I offended you, that wasn't my intention. I read your original comment but now that I see you edited, I can see I bothered you. Again, I apologize. \n\nI strive to be a DN that absolutely benefits any community I am a part of, I feel wholeheartedly that thoughtful people can help a local economy without damaging it. I pray that I am on the right \"team\" as it were. \n\nBut Mexico City is by all measures, one of the sad cases. It has become inhospitable both economically and culturally to the locals. Americans in particular but all the tourists there have done a great injustice to the people and the culture. As DNs it should be a case study in how not to act. I sincerely hope that no other city has that experience but in this case I was talking about how I wish BsAs doesn't go the way Mexico City has. \n\nI don't wish to go down this rabbit hole with you but can I offer that maybe the townspeople in your story were not upset about the economics but something else that came along with the battery factory. You wrote, \"The locals hated it and couldn\u2019t recognize the influx of money/jobs is going to raise their housing prices ten fold.\" Maybe there was something else afoot? I have no idea I wasn't there but lots of factories come into communities and they bring dangerous conditions. A battery factory could cause massive fires (over 1000 fires in Australia this year alone from battery plants, I remember one in the news in Illinois), batteries can cause major chemical sewage - which if unregulated could cause all sorts of horrible health concerns. Especially in a situation where you have a poor area (one that you said would otherwise be dead) getting a big factory means the local government will bend over backwards and maybe let things slide they shouldn't. I wasn't in the meeting, I don't know what plant you are speaking of, but I see your point. Some people can't see the forest for the trees. I don't think Digital Nomads are bad, or else I wouldn't be one for the past 6 years. I was pointing out a very specific case.",
            "Yeah children are issue. But since mine aren't dependant any more, can do it.",
            "Okay awesome, thank you I appreciate that info. Yeah I think I\u2019ll look to go around September, that seems to make the most sense given I really don\u2019t need to be in Europe in the middle of peak tourist season. I\u2019ll check out the Rufasa neighbourhood too. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",
            "Oh cool, well that\u2019s an exciting adventure to begin!\n\nI think the biggest thing I learnt through digital nomading was that I can\u2019t replace my actual \u201clife\u201d with travel. The same rules (so to speak) still apply as if you were at home. \n\nHave your daily life \u2014 routines, habits, the things you want to work on and accomplish, the boring aspects we all want to run away from in our home towns. \n\nThen you have \u201ctravel\u201d \u2014 the parts of life that get to be moments of excitement, amazement, awe, adventure, novelty, etc. But those moments are simply moments of your daily life, they add to your life, they are not your entire life.\n\nTrying to blend these two together too much and not respecting the need to have both pillars, is where I got a bit confused on my first digital nomad adventure.\n\nI really thought I wouldn\u2019t need structure, or routine and I\u2019d be constantly having cool, exciting experiences, exploring \u2014 as I was working. But that wore away very quickly and I was confused why I wasn\u2019t having fun, and instead I was just tired and a bit burnt out.\n\nUntil I started to realise the point of being able to work remotely is to *enable* more travel and adventure\u2014 enable more opportunities to experience culture, food, awe that I can\u2019t access as often at home. And in reverse\u2014 the travel aspect nurtures my need to have a base of stability, routine. So that I can recharge, focus, debrief, nourish myself and allow travel to be the novelty that it is. \n\nHopefully that makes sense haha. Didn\u2019t mean for this comment to get so long, but wanted to share (probably more as a reminder for myself tbh lol).\n\nMaybe this will not resonate with you, it was just something I had to learn! Have the best time, and stay safe. You\u2019re going to experience so much cool stuff!",
            "Oh awesome! That\u2019s really cool. It actually sounds a bit like Sydney (where I\u2019m from), so certainly sounds like a good option.\n\nAny neighbourhoods/areas that you enjoyed?",
            "It\u2019s tough. Despite us being a lesser demographic than immigrant \u201cexpats\u201d and far less than tourists, we\u2019re the ones taking all the hate. \n\nTourist there for a week using English to order tacos? No, that\u2019s a digital nomad not integrating.\n\nExpat with a handle on the real estate market buying up multiple properties? No, that\u2019s a digital nomad raising rent prices.\n\nLocal opens a business to cater to new demand? No, that\u2019s a digital nomad gentrifying the neighborhood.\n\nTourists are too transient and bring too much money. Immigrants are there long term and have influence. Locals are happy for the new business and don\u2019t care to get caught in the cross fire. Digital nomads are therfore the perfect scapegoat.",
            "hmmmmm yeah that makes total sense! I could fall into that trap for sure, especially at first. I'm sure they're be a lot of weird stuff in terms of lifestyle and routine that I had not even considered. But honestly I'm even excited for that part because right now I am sooooooo bored with life haha",
            "I get you haha. You\u2019ll figure it all out as you go. Just remember to have fun and don\u2019t sweat the small stuff haha",
            "Sound advice no matter the circumstance! :)"

Many residents are unable to afford an apartment after rents have risen by close to 70% in the past 10 years, while the cost of buying a home has increased by almost 40%, Collboni said at a City Council meeting on 21 June, adding that access to housing has become a driver of inequality, particularly for young people. This has led the local government to take drastic measures to guarantee access to housing in the city, the mayor of Barcelona continued.\n\n\"We cannot permit that the majority of young people who wish to leave home also have to leave Barcelona,\" said Collboni,\u00a0[according to leading Spanish newspaper El Pais](https://elpais.com/espana/catalunya/2024-06-21/barcelona-eliminara-los-pisos-turisticos-de-la-ciudad-en-cinco-anos.html).\n\nThe issue of overtourism has been a growing concern in Barcelona in recent years.\n\n# Spain, the second most-visited country in the world\n\nSpain is one of the\u00a0[most-visited countries in the world](https://www.statista.com/statistics/261726/countries-ranked-by-number-of-international-tourist-arrivals/). According to a report published by Statista in June 2024, the country\u2019s visitor numbers are second only to those of France, having received more than 85 million international tourists in 2023, a higher number than the pre-pandemic record of 83 million in 2019. Meanwhile, Catalonia, with its capital city Barcelona, was\u00a0[the region of Spain that received the most international tourists in 2023](https://www.statista.com/statistics/447801/foreign-tourists-visiting-spain-by-destination-region/).\n\nIn recent years it has become increasingly tricky to obtain permission for short-term apartment rentals in Barcelona. Since 2012, a tourist licence has been required in order to legally rent out an apartment defined as a \u201cVivienda de Uso Tur\u00edstico\u201d (home for tourism use) in Barcelona for a duration of fewer than 31 days. Last year, the rules were tightened with licenses being limited to a maximum of ten tourist apartments per 100 inhabitants. In addition, the city put an end to permanent licenses for\u00a0tourist apartments, instead forcing them to be renewed every five years. The local government has also been redoubling its efforts to hunt down and shutter illegal tourist rentals.\n\nBarcelona's Gothic Quarter gets especially crowded during the busy the summer season.\n\n# The war against illegal tourist apartments\n\nThese measures have resulted in the shutting down of 9,700 illegal tourist rentals since 2016, while almost 3,500 apartments have been converted back into housing for local residents.\n\nToday\u2019s move is the most drastic to date, one that the leading Barcelona-based daily newspaper\u00a0[La Vanguardia predicts will result in a \"bloody judicial war\"](https://www.lavanguardia.com/local/barcelona/20240621/9749899/barcelona-eliminara-todos-pisos-turisticos.html). If Mayor Collboni gets his way, the City Council will eliminate the 10,101 licensed tourist apartments currently in the city no later than November 2028. His move, which has left the tourism sector stunned, is expected to be opposed by various players, not least the employers\u2019 association of Barcelona's tourist apartments, and will likely result in a drawn-out legal battle.\n\nMeanwhile, vacation rental platform Airbnb, which hosts a considerable number of Barcelona\u2019s short-term rental listings, has not yet made an official [statement.Barcelona](http://statement.Barcelona) Announces Plan To Ban Tourist Rental Apartments By 2028\n\n[Isabelle Kliger](https://www.forbes.com/sites/isabellekliger/)\n\nAnnouncement came early this afternoon via El Pais: [https://elpais.com/espana/catalunya/2024-06-21/barcelona-eliminara-los-pisos-turisticos-de-la-ciudad-en-cinco-anos.html](https://elpais.com/espana/catalunya/2024-06-21/barcelona-eliminara-los-pisos-turisticos-de-la-ciudad-en-cinco-anos.html)",

            "I am a long term AirBnb user and am now looking for alternatives.  \n\nHotels are not attractive because I like to be able to cook while I vacation (it\u2019s part of the fun for me) and lounging in a suite is much more enjoyable than a hotel bedroom.\n\nHowever, I feel tremendously guilty for the havoc this innovation has created for rental housing everywhere.  My own kids struggle to find affordable rental apartments in their cities, forcing them into very low quality apartments as high prices or to move to other cities that are more affordable but lack the employment opportunities of big cities.\n\nI see the problem as one of investors (big and small) buying property purely for income potential, rather than renting out their own home.  AirBnb didn\u2019t create that problem, though their platform certainly made it easy to do. \n\nHuman behavior often serves the interests of the self with disregard for others.  And when this runs amok, government needs to set new rules to check it.\n\nSo, I will try not to contribute to the problem anymore. It\u2019s a matter of personal integrity.",

            "If Barcelona is anything like my city the problem is not really the short term rentals but the digital nomads that come live here with a higher buying power than us but most importantly the hundreds of vacant houses in the city.\n\nI'd love to see my government do something about that instead of short term rentals. I understand that monthly prices being controlled can go a bit to the communist route but I don't see any other option.",
            "Most likely it'll just be regulated. Anyone making money off people staying in their places will need a license or something, and be subject to many of the same requirements as small BnBs or mini-hotels.

And it\u2019s not the tourists who are the problem.\n\nI wonder what the population increase of Barcelona has been over the last 50-100 years, relative to available housing stock? \n\nAt the end of the day this seems like demagoguery and xenophobia. In Europe, it\u2019s always the foreigners who cause the problems.",

And that amount is proportional to the size of the location. Big cities like Barcelona can handle millions of tourists every year and then hit the breaking point (like it just did). Small fishing towns across the Mediterranean hit that breaking point in a single year when they become a tourist hotspot without even millions coming in.\n\nBasically its a matter of the locals' rights vs the foreigners'.

But they don't hire hundreds of locals and create jobs. Even without plagues like Airbnb local housing gets hit as more hotels are built and buildings are turned to hotels by those who profit from tourism. All the local shops and services up their prices. The end result always ends up being the actual locals getting priced out of not only housing but even the actual cost of living all the way to groceries and daily items they need.

            "So, first, I feel like anything with .blog doesn't generally strike me as a citation for \"all research,\" but at least the author does go into a number of studies/papers/reviews later on.  I can't say much about whether any of those are peer-reviewed or what even that much means practically speaking (I know what the concept is, just not how one can actually track it or whatever).\n\nI think the bigger issue is the perspective dissonance.  People like braneshifter (and myself, for that matter), are often coming from a stance of lower income/affordable housing options for the working class, who don't have the bargaining power Noah talks about in the middle of the article (hey landlord, I'm thinking about going over there), as well as looking at ways to address the homelessness issues.  I don't want to get into those issues cuz fuck if I know what to do with those either.\n\nBut the issue for working class people is that the middle class perspective of allowing the free market to nudge things over time just...doesn't look effective.  What we see are our rents going up and new developments rising that are so laughably far outside our means, while we can't find units in our price range because our income isn't moving anywhere.\n\nBut.  \nI *think* - and am not sure - that the \"logic and rationality\" changing around the housing market is that it's a slightly different animal.  Noah talks about cars and people owning civics, and then a lambo coming in.  But that analogy fails in housing market where instead of everyone owning a civic, you have a couple companies who are buying cars and then charging other people to rent them and drive them, costing them more than if they actually owned the car themselves.  This means that the civics that aren't owned can actually be sold for *higher*, right?  Like, let's say the civic costs 26k; paid off over 26 months at 1k per month.  Stupid numbers but simple.  Now, some rich person has bought 30% of the civics in the city and is charging people 1100/month to drive them.  No one actually wants to rent the civics, but if they can't afford to buy it, they're kinda stuck.  So we look at the civics that aren't owned.  Anyone selling a civic knows that the standard is 1100/month, so they can get a good market share by selling them for 1050/month to those who can afford them.\n\nHousing doesn't apply supply and demand the same way because it's a case where someone else can *own* the widget while the person *using* it still does.  You can't have that with a Playstation, by and large; leasing cars is a somewhat niche approach, I think, though I could be wrong on that (and a lot of things really).\n\nSo, let's move forward to the lambos.  Ignoring that, in all likelihood, the person who owns 30% of the civics probably owns 8% of the Lambos or something as well.  The person who owns some of the civics can see that Lambos are going for, say, 2200/month.  Clearly, there are people driving civics who could afford lambos but aren't doing so.  So, even though they're renting the civics for 1100, they know that *at least some* civics could be rented for 1200.  or 1400.  And when someone stops renting one of their civics to get a lambo, they raise the price.\n\nI was renting an apartment a few years ago.  The rent kept moving up because it was admittedly fairly low to begin with, but I think there are limits on how much you can raise rent in a given period?  Idk.  But when I moved out because I couldn't afford that place anymore, the place then went *way* up.  That's not the market adjusting things lower because there are market-rate developments coming in (and there are - like I said before, there's always new developments coming up in my town that are >400k).\n\nIf someone is upgrading from 1500 to 2100, that's leaving a 1500 open.  Assuming that 1500 actually stays at 1500, the point Noah is making/referencing/citing is that someone will leave a 1200 to go to the 1500, leaving a 1200 for someone who previously didn't have it.  \n\nAnd my question is...why not start with the 1200s?  And if the only reason is that no one would build it because it isn't profitable, then you start falling into the basic difference in thought between \"the big-scale society > the individual\" and the converse.  I personally don't believe that profit motive is a healthy way to address many things in society, even as I can acknowledge that greater \"market freedom\" can often raise standard of living across the board.  It just doesn't look to me like that approach is working too well for the growing homelessness problem and the declining ability of many people to even hope to afford their own home someday.  Econ 101 assumes a certain equivalence of purchasing power and information, as well as a simplicity of producer and consumer.  None of that's true in Housing.",
            "Yes, that's literally what I just said.   \n  \nHousing is unaffordable mostly because inflation is out of control and interest rates are much higher, which makes house payments unaffordable. Airbnb is a very *small* part of the pressure being put on affordable housing.",
            ">Major businesses that are hiring hundreds of people aren't sticking their factories or offices in the middle of tourist cities\n\nI grew up in a major tourist spot and also worked in tourism, and there is abso-fking-lutely no case of any major business that hires hundreds of people outside the city somewhere as tourism picks up in a locale. The processes and organization structures of even the tourism agencies are greatly optimized, and an increase in tourism does not lead to significant proportional employment outside the region either.\n\nThe local businesses don't get sh\\*t from tourism apart from a few tourist-oriented shops that can actually sell to tourists. But *everybody* raises their prices.\n\n>so your point about taking housing from people who work in the area is wrong\n\nDon't make grandstanding statements on things you don't know about. Anywhere tourism became significant, hotels got more zoning in urban planning, and in the long run, the existing local housing was taken over by tourist-oriented businesses or outright rich foreigners buying them up and gentrifying the locals.

The UK has higher food safety standards, better regulation of organic/pesticide free status, and almost all the fruit/veg you buy is the top grade.\n\nYou'll pay more for food, but it's almost guaranteed to be safe and exactly what it says it is.\n\nMediterranean countries have great food, but most have far worse regulation and control over what's sold.\n\nLondon has a really massive range of food both in terms of culture and in terms of basic to premium. If you want an apple you can trace to the tree it was grown from, then it's available, and delivered to your door.\n\nMost of the places people are recommending have far more chance of contamination, even if the food is objectively fresher and often nicer.",
            "You can eat healthy food anywhere. The keys are: stay out of restaurants, don't eat boxed/prepared food, learn to cook. \n\nYour best bet is finding someone's grandmother and learning from her.",
            "Look at bpc-157, no medical advice of course but the pills/nasal sprays have been incredible in my experience healing stomach issues.",

            "You've been fucked up long before coNvid came about",
            "Yeah, I've been thinking of Cyprus non-dom program anyway. Not sure how's the food probably pretty fresh. At least in TikTok people hype it up lol. So that could be something to look into to get two birds with one flight",
            "Thanks! Any specific cities you'd recommend?",
            "Thanks! Any specific cities or places? Maybe look into the 3 biggest cities..?\n\nI've been thinking of Poland, I Googled something like \"best EU vegetarian reddit\" (I'm not vegetarian, but ATM it seems to help my situation) and the most upvoted was Warsaw which was really interesting.\n\nThe smallish family farms sound exactly what I'm after, definitely more nutrient dense than some billion-dollar-monsanto type stuff.",
            "Yeah, 100% \ud83d\udc46",
            "I will \u2013 thanks! If you wanna share anything more about it and how it's helped, I'm all ears (eyes..?)",
            "Thank you for this helpful comment on finding best food in the EU \ud83d\ude4f",
            "Southern Italy beats Spain if you will eat out often. Both will be great for produce but restaurants are way better with fresh food in Italy, particularly in the day to day, cheaper options.",
            "In Spain it nakes no difference really, as long as you stay away from tourist areas. Granada, Valencia, Asturias, Madrid, Segovia, Girona...",
            "Warsaw is pbly a good bet if you like a bigger city vibe and something international. If you like a mid size city and more Polish vibe id recommend Krakow and Wroclaw (both are college/student towns) and Gdansk is also really nice. Its a coastal city on the Baltic Sea.",
            "Warsaw is a good option. You have plenty of international restaurants and activities as well as the traditional Polish food. Even the small convenience stores have fresh vegetables fruits and breads in them. You\u2019ll find a lot less processed foods and less pre-made meals the further east you get in Europe. \n\nWithout the war I\u2019d tell you to come to Lviv. Almost every restaurant besides McDonald\u2019s and Dominos are cooking from scratch. There\u2019s barely any frozen or canned food beyond vegetables unless you really go looking for it.",
            "Feel free to dm but genuinely it helped with a variety of stomach issues.  Read up on it a bit.  It\u2019s a naturally occurring gastric peptide. Unfortunately it\u2019s become a bit controversial over the last few months but in terms of the supplements I\u2019ve taken in my experience it has helped tremendously with a variety of injuries as well as stomach problems.",
            "Thanks! I really appreciate this kind of detailed advice!\n\nWhat do you think is the reason for better restaurants in Italy? Also, any specific cities or places?",
            "Culture, tradition. Spanish cuisine involves lots of fried food, lots of canned food, lots of salt. Italy is way more into fresh ingredients and produce.\n\nPuglia is my favorite part of Italy, cities like Bari, Brindisi or Lecce would be my suggestion; although Palermo or Catania in Sicily might be better if you want a more socially active lifestyle as there are way more expats and nomads."
