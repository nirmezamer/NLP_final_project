            "Question: a lot of times people ask for social media tags because they like the art and want to look into getting a piece from them. I\u2019m assuming that is also discouraged and considered doxxing..? Or no, because doxxing is only when it\u2019s done with shit tattoos and malice? Genuinely unsure",

            "So is gamertag dropping also illegal ?",

            "[removed]",
            "I will also note that after the mods removed the comment sharing the social media reddit also took action and completely removed the comment as well. Also, the post that you're referring to was not removed. Only a single comment",
            "Yeah I really feel this should be context dependent.",
            "This doesn't have anything to do with her being sa'd. It is literally illegal to dox someone and can result in the sub being removed or legal issues that affect the person and possibly the mods as well.",
            "She and anyone else are perfectly allowed to make posts like that and ask for help in her situation. In fact, I encourage it. I do not want her to get into any kind of possible trouble or the sub because A few people who got this link decided to harass them which the person could then sue for. And because of how the legality If they are sued The judge can only focus on whether whether they actually doxxed this person or not. It does suck That the legal system doesn't take into account reasoning for this kind of situation. There are local resources in most places that allow somebody to get help. I have had to use these myself. The last thing she needs is to be sued by the dude. And judges can be very unpredictable with these kinds of cases as they are not used to them and many don't really understand what doxxing is. \n\nI make this post since I have been doxxed so I have talked to a lawyer about it. In my situation the authorities didn't do much after they found out the person was using a burner account. However finding who owns a reddit account like that is much easier.",
            "Yeah, I'm with you on that.",
            "Generally doxxing is considered sharing names and contact info that the person doesn't intend for the public to have access to. A public Instagram page with their work and studio name wouldn't count as doxxing, but saying something like \"oh this tattoo artist's real name is Jane Smith and she lives at 123 Main Street/ has another job at the Starbucks on Grand Ave.\" would absolutely be doxxing.",
            "Legally that is very much a grey zone while yes the intention is not malicious. It can still be consider doxxing legally as you don't know the intention of other people who now have access to this information. The answer of your question honestly would probably come down to the ruling of a judge. I'm making this to err on the side of caution So that the sub does not get taken down or finding itself in any legal issues",
            "I dunno, it's just saying a tradesperson is bad at their trade.  These people often have Google reviews and whatnot anyway.",
            "Wasn\u2019t crazy snake/dagger/back lady doxxing her artist?  Inviting all of Reddit to spam his IG with bad reviews and such?",
            "Technically no but there is no reason to do that here",
            "I would say that there really isn't a need to share the name Or social media in this sub. As it is mainly for advice And doing so, especially if the tattoo isn't good. It encourages harassment which then can be led back to the sub which is of course not a good thing it can also possibly put the person at risk if say the artist chooses to retaliate. That is also considered a doxxing. Yes, it is supposed to be a public place to be able to share your tattoos and get advice for it. It is not a place for specifically going after a particular artist. I also feel it would be better served in a local context to call out an artist for doing bad work as This is a public place filled with people from around the world so it wouldn't be as helpful as leaving a detailed review and spreading the word locally about said person. \n\nI do take down posts that call out the names of people when I see them regardless of the context of the situation. There are much better ways to address the situation than saying their name in a sub that's meant specifically for advice about tattoos.",
            "I don't know what country you're in, but doxxing isn't illegal in most places.\n\nI'm in the UK, and it isn't although ensuing harassment may be. In the US, it's only illegal when coupled with explicit calls to do harm.\n\nIs it against reddit ToS? Possibly, I can't say I know that, but simply sharing someone's social media is not uncommon on this sub, as people often share artist portfolios (good and bad), so you have to be able to see why the timing of this post looks suspicious",
            "Yes that is the original cause of this",
            "It actually is illegal in a lot more places. and is slowly becoming progressively more illegal. Especially depending on who's looking at the case they can view the act of doxxing as a threat in itself as that has happened multiple times. I can see how it may look suspicious making a post with this timing. I do not want to risk legal issues anyone or risk the sub on a possible technicality. Sharing examples of previous work from the artist is fine. Just avoid having any of their personal information like social media tags in it. Yes somebody can back search information If they chose to try to harass somebody. In this case, however, as the person took effort to hide their identity that would fall on the person who actively tracked down the source of the portfolio."

You use Aquaphor 4x a day making sure you only use a small dab or two spread all over and rubbed into the tattoo, then use clean paper towel to dab off any excess so it's moisturized but dry. This makes your healing still scab to heal faster but stay smooth and moisturized and doesn't crack and flakes much less holding far more ink and plasma in the healing wound.\n\nIf you use too much Aquaphor and glob it on, you can have problems healing.

That's not how it looks or how it presents (it especially doesn't \"bubble up\" like the ooze in the picture) and the time frame is totally off.
