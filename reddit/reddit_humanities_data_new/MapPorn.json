Bundesl\u00e4nder Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Niedersachsen e.g. dont call themselves that, coz there is no historical precedent for that name in these areas as a whole, but they only formed after 1945 out of what were formerly multiple L\u00e4nder.

            "There are a ton of reasons but in short:\n\nNorthern Italy had a stronger middle class and a stronger focus on mercantilism during the Middle Ages because it was divided in city states, so the nobility focused on the cities much more than your average European noble, whereas Southern Italy had a more typical feudal landlord style nobility as it was more or less unified throughout the middle ages (And even when it wasn't, it was not nearly as fragmented as Northern Italy).\n\n\nFor most of the middle ages, Northern Italy was safer from incursions, because whatever incursion from Africa would land in Southern Italy, and the Alps meant even France and the HRE would have a hard time invading.\n\n\nEven when foreign powers *did* carve up the peninsula, Southern Italy faced direct conquest from Spain (Note that at this time Southern Italy was still actually very wealthy, just not as much as Northern Italy) which was all too happy to milk it dry to fund its wars.\nAlso they favored centralisation around Naples, which did make it a centre of culture and economy but also severely hampered the development of the rest of Southern Italy. Meanwhile France preferred to make the existing Italian city/regional states into client states for the most part, allowing them to maintain a degree of autonomy.\n\n\nThe biggest reason is of course industrialization, it started in the UK and made its way southwards, which means Northern Italy industrialised first (Southern Italy did develop some industrial hubs of its own but owing to its more centralised nature it was only in a few key cities like Naples or Taranto).\n\n\nThe unification of Italy was spearheaded by the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont which extended its laws to the entire peninsula, which meant the following economic policy of the kingdom of Italy favoured heavily Northern Italy (Whose economic structure was closer to Piedmont's) over Southern Italy.\n\n\nRight after the unification, Southern Italy faced what in Italy is known as \"brigantaggio\", a massive wave of criminality which drove away investments further and is the origin of what is today known as mafia. It also made Southern Italy into a political hot potato politicians did not want to deal with, the first actual plans to address the \"Southern question\" were drafted by the first De Gasperi government, in the wake of the post WW2 reconstruction. \n\n\nIt *has* improved a lot since but think about how much different East and West Germany are, owing to the Cold War which didn't even last a full 50 years, Southern and Northern Italy have followed different historical paths one way or another for over a millennia.\n\n\nObviously i could go more in detail, there are a whole lot of books written about any of these points, but i hope it gave you an idea.",

But in Russia it was more profitable for russianspeaking from the central and eastern regions, because it was closer, easier and there was no language barrier.  \n  \nAs for the vaunted inheritance: after the collapse of the USSR, Ukraine turned out to be with a lossmaking industry, which was not able to compete in a market economy (this was clear long before that for whole USSR economy).\n\nThe defense enterprises, for which the USSR economy worked, lost its significance, the era of the \"wind of changes\" came, no one was waiting for war with the neighbors, it became not profitable to produce it, and the reserves were sold out. \n\nThe mines by that time have exhausted their potential and the Donbass became subsidized. The miners, accustomed to a good life in the USSR, began to accuse Ukraine of worsening their position, although the end of this laid the transition from coal to atomic energy in soviet times. It became one of the reasons for separatism in 2014. \n\nUkraine gradually got out of the 90s crisis and built its trade relations most densely with Russia, which Russia used and at times set bonded conditions. After the crisis of 2008, which reduced the GDP by a third, Yanukovych\u2019s cadence occurred. He robbed the country and spent the gold-foreign exchange reserves on maintaining the stability of the hryvnia. As a result, after his flight, the beginning of the war and the occupation of Russia Crimea and the territory of Donbass, as well as the need to reorient trade, the Ukrainian economy was in the abyss, from which it was chosen until 2022. \n\nThe economy showed good growth and here we have reached that difference in minimal salaries.
