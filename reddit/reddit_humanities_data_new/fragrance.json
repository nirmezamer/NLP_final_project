            "I\u2019m looking for a new niche signature scent. \nI\u2019ve been wearing This Is Her by Zadig&Voltaire for years now and that\u2019s really my signature scent. I haven\u2019t found anything like it that scratches my itch. \nI never thought I would like this sweet, lactonic smell but somehow it captivates me every time. At first I thought it was the sandalwood that really fit me, so I bought Santal Volcanique by Maison Crivelli and Bois de Balincourt by Maison Louis Marie. Although I like them, they\u2019re not my favorite. I even think Bois de Balincourt smells like pickles on me sometimes. \nDoes anybody have any recommendations?",

I'm also sensitive to super strong scents they make my head hurt. Anyone have recommendations for somewhat natural smelling and not super strong fragrances that aren't too expensive (less than $50). Even better if they're widely available in walmart, Target, etc. looking for something to have on all day without being overpowering",

            "\u00a0Some people approach fragrance as an art or entertainment. Like I can't stand scary movies but some people have to have them. And some people do collect fragrances they don't necessarily want to wear. I'm into superhero movies and mall perfumes. Others want the most accurate mountain lion postcoital fragrance they can get.\u00a0",
            "I think most of it isn't that extreme. For example, I like pure green fragrances (think: just-watered garden, dirt, etc). Some ppl think it just smells bad & like \"outside\" &c. I also really enjoy this one fragrance that was modelled after the smell of an ant pile. Not in a I-trained-my-nose way, but in a genuine, my first-instinct taste is in this direction\u2014it's just a matter of taste\n\nPersonally, I love to see it. I saw a request for a \"bone\" scented fragrance earlier this week, and it was really fun & exciting to see",
            "As others have said, the more extreme ones are sometimes intended to be art, and people like them more because they are interesting or thought provoking than because they are pleasant. Like how people don't always want to listen to upbeat pop music, but sometimes want something angry or sad or with harsh guitars or screamy vocals.\n\nBut also, people just have different tastes. A lot of people genuinely like animalic notes, or notes like dirt or metallic notes or green notes. Animalic notes used to be common even in really popular fragrances because they smell good. They don't smell good to you maybe, but that doesn't make them not a good smell.\n\nAnd lastly, a lot of fragrances claim that they have out-there notes like \"blood\" or \"cocaine\" or \"credit cards\" or whatever as purely a marketing thing. The ad copy (because that's what note lists are) is far more shocking than the actually fragrance. If no one told you those notes were supposed to be there, you'd never guess.",
            "Because it's entertaining. To me, perfume is like 10% fashion accessory and 90% fun. These scents lean into the fun part of it. I enjoy it when perfumers push the boundaries like this. It also develops my own sensibility, to smell different things outside the context they're usually found in. (Doesn't mean I'd wear Against Nature to a job interview, mind.)",
            "Fragrance is art and not all art has to be pretty. \n\nOther than that, some people find various types of animalic stink rather comforting. \n\nDifferent tastes.",
            "For the same reason you have people who enjoy extreme piercings and tattoos,people have different tastes. Some people absolutely hate gourmands. Some people do like building a collection of different fragrances. Also the notes don\u2019t mean they quite literally smell like that,I think..either way those types of perfumes aren\u2019t popular, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s common to casually run into someone wearing such a scent either",
            "It's preference and a little bit of fun. I love heavy animalics. I genuinely like the smell and I appreciate the artistry. Do I wear them out and subject the general populace to sweaty booty scents? No lol HOWEVER, I do love when I come across an animalic that's very wearable like the Francesca Bianchi line. I wouldn't wear them to work, but out and about doing errands or on a night out I sure would.",
            "I'm fascinated by scents that are evocative, whether or not they are pretty, traditional scents. I love when they manage to create an *experience* using scent. \n\nA fragrance that feels like walking along a rocky beach on a rainy day next to the forest...wet earth and stone, driftwood, salt, seaweed, pine needles...it immediately brings me there and I love that. \n\nA campfire on a late summer night, smoky and earthy and maybe some ground coffee..\n\nOlympic Orchid's Kingston Ferry is *the exact* experience of walking around an old ferry dock. How did they do that??\n\nSpent gunpowder, leather, and  paper. An old pistol in a dark study, smoking a pipe. \n\n That's what I love about it. Creating or re-creating a memory through scent. \n\nI also like standard fragrances and they are most of what I wear daily but these other ones are the ones that excite me. They are an experience.",
            "In this space? People really appreciate the hobby, and find genuine joy and appreciation for the artistry behind a photorealistic scent. Around the office? \u2728attention\u2728 lmao",
            "Take a look at [this](https://www.russh.com/schiaparelli-haute-couture-ss22/). Do you see people wearing clothes like that at the local wal-mart? Would you wear that on a date?\n\nDo you consider [this a pleasant painting](https://albertinum.skd.museum/en/exhibitions/der-krieg/) to hang above your fireplace in your living room?\n\nYou can wear a comfy t-shirt, you can put up a painting of a pleasant sunny landscape. But some people creating clothing and paintings are using them as a medium for artistic expression, not just decoration\n\nSame goes for fragrance.",
            "Have you seen the scent that smells like gasoline, burning rubber and napalm?  \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4d\n\nFor when your fragrance chooses war and violence!",
            "I think it helps to think of nasty scents the same way you\u2019d think of shock horror films. Most people will avoid them, some people will watch them to analyze the details/messages/artistry, and a small group will seek them out because they\u2019re genuinely into sick shit.\n\nThat also means there can be a big variety in the quality of \u201cnasty\u201d scents. Is the perfumer trying to tell a thought provoking story, or are they just throwing in the most shocking notes they can to get attention? \n\nI personally haven\u2019t tried any bodily fluid-inspired scents and I\u2019m a little wary of most animalics, but I\u2019ve been getting more into unconventional and off-putting fragrances as my collection grows.",
            "Some fragrances are good atmospherics.  The original Bat was this for me.  I didn't want to smell like that but I absolutely loved it in the air (that's how I used it)\n\nSome of the Demeter line also used as atmospherics.  I had no desire to smell like play doh and crayons but they're fun to smell and they bring back fun memories.\n\nThe interesting part of all this is how different we all are.Some smell blood where  there's no blood (sometimes accidental notes) and where some perfumes that are supposed to have these notes, some don't pick up on them I remember when Secretions Magnifique came out and people were going like OMG I smell blood and semen....\n\nI did not smell those.  I mean I guess if I squinted and used my imagination more maybe I could see it, but otherwise....no. I did not like how metallic it could get though.\n\nPerfume is for many a wearable art form (or unwearable depending on who you ask)    I don't always understand the perfumer's interpretation but that's a me thing",
            "Because at some point freshies, aquatics and gourmands become boring to an experienced nose and you end up craving something completely different.",
            "I don\u2019t think the scents are supposed to come across as nasty per se, but I do believe that everyone perceives fragrances differently. My all time favourite perfume is xerjoff Alexandria ii, and I\u2019ve heard people say it smells like a soiled diaper \ud83d\ude02 I don\u2019t get that in the slightest! I get a powdery lavender mixed with dried woods. Other people think Amouage Silver Oud smells like human poop where as I just think it smells like burnt wood \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb",
            "I honestly love animalic scents\u2026not into fecal notes but musky, slightly sweaty notes, etc.  Just because it didn\u2019t appeal to you doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t appeal to others.  Why do I like animalic fragrances?  I don\u2019t really know.  I just do.",
            "For the art of it, perfumers are artists as much as painters, musicians and chefs are, so we need artists that are willing to push the boundaries of what's common and acceptable, you might not want yo wear it, but it existing makes the world inherently more interesting.",
            "This one made me LOL. \nI too was confused as I\u2019m also new to fragrances, but I\u2019ve realized people truly enjoy the scents in nontraditional ways. They don\u2019t like it because it\u2019s beautiful/ wearable, they enjoy it because it triggers a little something in their brain that makes them go \u201cahhh\u201d the way an ugly painting would appeal to some and not all. You should search up the way people express their love for Zoologist fragrances here on Reddit. Some of the explanations are out of this world, but you can tell it brings the wearer genuine happiness. They all say \u201cI wear it for me\u201d which I respect :)",
            "I view it as people wearing couture: it isn\u2019t necessarily about always wearing something flattering or beautiful, but wearable art or embodying a fantasy. Sometimes art is about something other than beauty; it\u2019s about emulating a feeling, making a historical reference, telling a story, etc.",
            "the perfumer of toskovat' once said in an interview that he made this perfume, called \"last birthday cake\" or smth like that, and an old lady smelled it, and started to cry.\nthat's what i want. i want people to start crying when they smell me lol.\nin all holy seriousness tho, why do YOU want to only be pleasant and smell what everybody considers acceptable? flowers for femininity, moss and cedar for masculinity, ugh, the boredom of it. life is to be lived - to be experienced in all its endless fascinating variety, without fear, with curiosity, with thirst. i want to learn everything there is about perfume, i want to see what scents it is possible to synthesize, i want to experience all the magical glorious repulsive and alluring concoctions, stimulating my trigeminal nerve.",

Heretic, the perfume house, does a lot of animalistic scents. Animalistic to me, is something attractive and sweet yet has a carnage or grossness to it.",

            "The really grim ones are just a niche thing enjoyed by the absolute minority, most fragrances that contain animalic notes contain such minute hints that it adds a little something to the fragrance without smelling like a farm. For example, initio absolute aphrodisiac has a castoreum note but instead of smelling like a beaver's butt, the overall perfume itself just smells like a sexy vanilla bean.",
            "To transport them",
            "I just like sniffing them. I dont wear the weird ones but I love them anyway. I have a little box of tiny samples I got from Surrender To Chance, with scents like CB I Hate Perfume After Party, Zoologist T-Rex, The Strange South Deerskin, Hexennacht Subspace, just to sniff them and go \"ooh weird\". I ordered Snif Dead Dinosaur just to sniff that one too!",
            " Sparks memories",
            "Never heard of someone using animal scented fragrance unless they are going hunting lol",
            "There might be medical reasons for it, particularly if someone experiences a change in their fragrance preferences.\n\nHormonal changes can make someone who loved, for instance, sweet perfumes for decades to have brutal reactions to them and prefer fresh perfumes instead. Both men and women can experience such episodes around their 50s, and balancing hormones fixes it most of the times.\n\nBut sometimes people start liking the smell of filth, human or other animals, because their brain does not recognize it as such anymore.\n\nOlfactory function is affected in people who suffer from liver disease, depending on the severity of hepatic encephalopathy.\n\nPatients with chronic kidney disease frequently experience alterations in the sense of smell.",
            "I have Dirt by Demeter because I used to live in Vancouver and I\u2019m always homesick for the smell of the forest and mountains and rain. I layer it with some other things that remind me of home. \n\nI don\u2019t actually recommend it as the projection and longevity sucks, to smell it I have to put my wrist up to my nose to smell it.

            "Because they want someone to match their freak",
            "For some people it's to be 'cool'... but for the target market of these scents its for people who have associated memories that they trigger, especially sexual experiences. Saliva, blood, semen, even fecal smells in the right small, even subconscious, quantities can elicit fond or exciting memories of formative sexual experiences which can be some of the most profound of multisensory memories. \n\nSo, if you haven't had sex or only like really clean vanilla sex where you run to the shower after every act due to lack of experience and attraction then these fragrances might not be for you. But, if you've ever been with someone you are intensely attracted to and you rip each other's clothes off at any chance you can get and you don't care that you might be a little sweaty or similar then these fragrances might trigger that memory of passion. You will smell ALL the smells you mentioned if you have spent the whole weekend in bed with someone mutually passionate. \n\nAside from that, these scent preferences can be triggered in the same way some fetishes can form - when two formative experiences overlap at the same time creating a link in the mind (one is usually sexual but not always). \n\nSadly, most perfumes that claim these smells as part of their marketing aren't very good at really getting it right, so it's more of a brand trying to be edgy rather than putting in honest effort.\n\nI was going to write some scenarios where you might end up liking these scent profiles but it's really down to IYKYK.",
            "People are into weird stuff... So whatever floats your boat type of deal I guess? \ud83e\udd14",
            "A lot of people are snobs and want to be seen as having more \"niche\" fragrances and tastes. But some people just think it's cool or interesting, and you can't fault those guys for having a good time.",
            "Sometimes these \"nasty\" notes don't smell nasty on some people. Fecal notes, for example, smell like blanched almonds on me.\n\nSometimes a \"nasty\" note uplifts other notes or accords bringing a composition closer to photo realism. Ammonia/cat piss notes, for instance, brings out those indolic qualities in jasmine notes that I love so much. You won't always smell these notes either if they simply serve as a building block of an overall composition.\n\nAs others has noted, some perfume, the artistic novelty involved is interesting and fun.",
            "In my opinion it\u2019s most often to indulge those scents that you love but never find in a fragrance. For example, gasoline or rotting bodies. It\u2019s for that little spot in your head where you love the smell of something awful. I do think it is meant to appeal to more alternative styles as well.",
            "When perfume is too nice i get bored of it. It may be super nice, but I won't wear it. Been there, done that. I need something odd or ugly to keep me hooked. With strange perfume I somehow constantly want to re-check if this anomaly i sense is still there.",
            "Sometimes it's fun to smell interesting stuff. It's the same reason why people will have durian or surstr\u00f6mming, unique experiences are just as fun as good ones and maybe even more so.",
            "Any well crafted, fine fragrance will have something that traditionally \"stinks\" about it. A scent without atleaat a touch of stink falls flat. That's why musk/ambergris/oud/ \"chemcial\" scents etc, all exist as a part of an over all fragrance. Those things all smell terrible on their own, but really make a scent pop and stand out if it's used well. \n\nSome of those stinky scents actually play really well with other traditional smells, and a singular note smell lets you fine tune your own signature sent (for example, blood(y)+  woodsy+ rose= one of my favorite). So sometimes you might want a bottle to play with to see how it works with others.\n\nThat said, I think the scents that are purposely designed to be just straight up offensive to the senses (like pig shit) are more for \"art\" and \"craft\" of fragrance design, or for those individuals who *want* to be offensive, which is likely a very small subset of a small group of people.",
            "I actually haven't been involved in this community to fully understand what constitutes as animalic. I want to smell some and pick up on what it is exactly lol. I LOOOVE replica - under the stars which lists \"animalic\" as a main accord but I don't know what part of it makes it that way? Someone teach me.",
            "I usually enjoy challenging scents, for instance I like smelling like mushrooms and rich loam at the base of an old forest stump.

            "You shouldn't feel sad about it at all. No one who knows and understands fragrances would ever hold it against you.  Our olfactory sense and our experience of scent are 2 very  individual and personal things. That's part of the magic. \n\n I have several fragrances I really wanted to love but don't and some that I love on the bottle but not on.   Or I love them on others but are horrid with my body's chemistry.  It's all part of the experience and the artistry of perfume.  \n\nThen there is a psychological factor involved  that adds another very deep layer of individuality.  Even if your nose picks up the exact same notes as mine in any given scent, the memories it evokes and how it make you feel vs how it makes me feel is very individual.  \n\nAnd that last one an aspect that really makes it intriguing too.  Where does a particular scent take you psychologically? That's the thrill of it or one of the thrills.   So feel free to fearlessly experience scents your very own way!",
            "I hate almost all mainstream/celeb perfumes. They all have such an off-putting base scent that is nauseating. I like the niche stuff simply because they don't normally have that offputting factor \ud83e\udd23",

            "If you do get it, I would wait for a sale-day because the mists at b&bw regularly go down to $4-$6 because of sales! <3\n\nLove it at bath and body works because they have so many scents at an affordable price. And most of them are good quality too. Getaway soiree is definitely a good quality one. I think it's a dupe of a luxury fragrance, but Im not sure.\n\nEdit: it's a dupe for tom ford Soleil Blanc",
            "I\u2019m in zone 6 and this is the first year I haven\u2019t had a patchouli plant in the last decade!! Just an annual for me, but if you\u2019re in zones 10-11 it could be a perennial for you! I agree with the above commenter, fresh patchouli is The Best patchouli smell ever. Closest I\u2019ve ever smelled to it was some match stick incense I got when I was a youngin, but it\u2019s real mild, earthy, and grounded smelling. \nMan now I\u2019m over here missing the damn plant lol",
            "Zone 5.  It's an annual where I live.   I put a few in the herb garden surrounded by French Tarragon and Lemon Verbena.",
            "Love this!! Totally agree. I have smelled some fragrances and just general scents that will take me back to such specific memories from years and years ago. Some will unlock things that I have completely blocked. It\u2019s incredibly fascinating!",
            "Oud of course \ud83d\ude10",
            "I\u2019ve tried about half of them and I agree they\u2019re a lot of fun. But for the life of me I can\u2019t wear them. Except for my beloved Trex.",
            "They cost a bomb to get to nz, and with the exchange rate. So I haven't tried them yet.  Hyrax was top of my list",
            "yes!!  it's sharper, greener and more complex than a lot of the mass produced oils presents.",
            "Nice! I\u2019m like an 8b or so. I\u2019m going to look for it. I\u2019ve never seen it sold anywhere though. What should I look for, seeds? Plantings?",
            "That sounds lovely",
            "Isn't it? That's one of the things I most enjoy!",
            "Good for you, T Rex, dang! I\u2019m wearing Bee today actually. Need to try others. Sampled Moth and it was not a positive experience lol.",
            "Damn! I\u2019ve heard that about NZ. I moved from the US to Canada and get pissy that I can\u2019t get some stuff but I\u2019ll admit the southern hemisphere has it worse.",
            "That\u2019s what has gotten me so interested in fragrances. I am new to it, but I have always been fascinated by them.",
            "lol Trex is a lot but it\u2019s still a \u2018perfume\u2019 if that makes sense? The others are more like works of art to me. \n\nBee is very nice. Moth was a problem."

        "content": "So I bought a fragrance and I decided to add a few samples of popular fragrance to my order. I usually selecy my samples with different criteria but this time I just wanted to know what some hyped fragragrances smell like.\n\n**Parfums de Marly delina**: Strong dislike, something just smells off to me. Rose with some sharp and acidic fruitiness. there is also a weird note slightly reminiscent of gasoline that makes my nose dry and phisically uncomfortable. Does not get better in the drydown. It is the one I disliked more of the bunch and I am surprised It 's considered a crowdpleaser.\n\n**Goldfield & Banks Ingenious Ginger:** I really liked this one. Opens sparkly, zesty and uplifting whith some floral undetones, and turns into a sweet candied ginger kind of smell. The drydown is a slightly spicy, warm vanilla. It is a nothing groundbraking but pleasant to my nose, overall quite sweet and leans feminine.\n\n**Liquides Imaginaire Blanche Bete** : I already knew I don't get along well with lactionic notes, but I wanted to try this one and give one last chance to this category. I did not hate It, but the milky note is exremely strong and prevented me from enjoying the fragrance. Opens with a blast of tuberose and Jasmine, after a few seconds the powder milk note prevails over anything else. In the drydown in tones down a little bit and becomes a musky laconic white floral.\n\n**Floraiku One Umbrella For Two:** The most unique of the bunch. Opens very savory and  nutty. Than jammy, sour fruity notes make thair appereance. It reminded me slighly of L' Erbolario Argan in the opening, but It is overall quite different from anying else I have tested . It is sweet but not overly so, maybe because the savoury \"toasted\" smell prevails over the sugary smell. Definitely very edible smelling though. Not my kind of fragrance but I found it interesting.\n\n**BDK Gris Charnel**: I thought I was going to love this one but found It  meh. Maybe my nose is broken. The opening is strong on cardamom, but I didn' t pick up the fig nor the tea note. Once top notes  are gone I don' t even smell any spiciness, but a quite fresh Iris/sandalwood fragrance. Definitely unisex, not unpleasant, totally forgettable.\n\n**Dusita Le pavillon D' or:** Ok this one is not really hyped, but I have seen people mention Dusita quite often. Maybe I choose the wrong fragrance from her. It was just unpleasant chaotic sour green with pissy notes to me. It tones down a bit in the drydown to be more wearable.",

            "Baciami by Bvlgari is popular right now. You might be smelling that, but honestly Emirati women wear everything and tend to have large perfume collections. They buy what\u2019s new and being promoted in the malls. You can always ask the workers promoting designer perfumes around the mall too, they are everywhere and will let you know what locals are buying.",
            "Before I answer you, keep in mind that most Emirati women use Bukhoor (incense? Not exactly sure if that's the correct English term) and they use it on their clothes/hair before going out. \nThey also tend to layer and use oud or musk oil before applying their perfumes. \nNow, besides that, Perfumes by Anfasic Dukhoon (shay shay is their best seller and it's a local Emirati brand found in mall booths. They're mainly known for their bukhoor),\n\n Abdulsamad al Quraishi - Musk Al aroos (bridal white musk oil or oil turned perfume - they do this in store.)\n\nSi by Giorgio Armani was very popular at some point and I think it still is. If you walk into a local sephora you can ask the employees for the popular perfumes bought by Emirati women. Also, underrated brand used by some Emiratis is Roberto Cavalli. Guerlain's Santal Royale, and Dior's perfume Gris Dior and Oud Ispahan are also commonly used. Besides those, some people do use Lattafa, and perfumes/oils from Rasasi and Swiss Arabian (all local companies to the UAE).",
            "i used to work as a fragrance specialist for versace and then ysl in sephora and debenhams dubai and i agree with everyone commenting - emirati women (and men) love to layer scents so from body wash to lotion to body powder the perfume oils then perfume (some even go the extra mile and spray on a body most before perfume - one that has either similar or complementary notes) and then a little razzle dazzle with bakhoor (smoke).",
            "It\u2019s very likely they are wearing attars - oil based (alcohol free) perfumes. \n\nMany of them contain Oud - so that might be a note you enjoy.\n\nEdited to add: I have a few attars in my collection, and they tend to be strong with massive sillage and longevity. Definitely a fun and inexpensive way to play with new scents.",
            "Is there a good UK source anyone can recommend for attars? I had an amazing bottle of attar of roses I brought back from Egypt, but it suffered a sad fate.",
            "Sidebar on attars: are they best in hotter climates or would they still work in, say, Ireland? I\u2019ve had mixed results in the cold and damp with oils. Seems they need the alcohol to disperse",
            "Yes, I think I might do that as I am still for a few days. My mission is to buy a few fragrances now :D So I will ask shop assistants for some help.",
            "Just to add on - Incence as in wood chips, oud, sandalwood, oil infused pressed tablets, etc.\u00a0\n\nNot the common frankincense and myrrh incense.",

            "Omg I hate oud. Especially cheap oud smells. I lived in the ME and accidentally bought some oud scented hand soap once. Awful lol",
            "You should easily be able to get attar shipped anywhere worldwide, as they aren\u2019t volatile. \n\nI\u2019d see about tracking down the exact same one you lost! \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Sultan Pasha and Scent Salim",
            "I use them in the UK - yes they sit closer to the skin, but can be absolutely wonderful.  You might like to layer them with something sprayed for a more immediate effect, but a complex attar can keep on giving for hours, subtly changing over the day and keeping you interested :)",
            "Also the new AUH Zayed airport carries a nice selection of frags in duty free, make space in your carry on! Otherwise I\u2019d recommend walking around Yas Mall or Galleria Mall for ideas",

            "I have never heard of this kind of incense you explain more?",
            "Absolutely fair comment. Can\u2019t argue with that. :)",
            "Cheap oud smells aren't oud, and I agree, they're awful.\n\nA proper oudh oil will cost a LOT of money, there are no cheap oudh smells because it's an expensive ingredient made from the rotted heartwood of the agar tree.  Every batch smells different according to the natural processes of decomposition.  The oil is black and tarry and so anything uncoloured definitely does not contain actual oudh, and anything hugely mass-market can't rely on it either (since mass-market needs an exact aroma profile, which is really hard with naturally variable oils).\n\nI have a couple of 3ml bottles of real oudh oils I've collected over the years - my personal favourite is a 20 year old Malay one, but they all differ, and they all go through a range of notes each time you sniff they are different as VOC's evaporate and mingle.  I love these, and dislike the synthetic oudhs as they are just a few simplistic notes as opposed to incredibly complex perfume ingredients.  They're a simplified version of the original.  They're the movie of the book.\n\nSo don't write oudh off entirely, but know that just about anything you can find on the high street isn't oudh.",
            "With apologies to the oud lovers\u2026 I completely agree with you. \n\nThere\u2019s no other single note which I dislike as intensely as oud. \n\nI really wish I liked it, but it just doesn\u2019t work for me either.",
