        "content": "There has been a slow and steady influx of unwanted and misguided conversation plaguing our boards over the last year or so. I don't think this is a surprise to any of you all. While we ultimately encourage healthy discussion around both the positives and negatives of dating the overall spirit of this sub has been lost. Many of our readers have expressed their concern to our moderation team and we honestly feel the same way.\n\nOur \"No Soap-boxing or Promoting an Agenda\" rule has always been on the sidebar for our users to see but I want to stress our current stance on the topic. **Soap-boxing will and has always included red/black-pill ideology, \"alpha-male\" talk, and the subset of vocabulary that comes with it.** \n\nThis means that using our board to preach about how there is no hope for men (or women) who are conventionally unattractive is unwanted and will be removed. Using our board to discuss how you think women are shallow and will only choose the top percentage of men is unwanted and will be removed. Even just a mention of the term \"Chad\" is unwanted and will be removed.\n\nWe can sympathize that dating is difficult and is even more difficult for people that might not be the prettiest. It's no secret to anyone. What we value though is genuine discussion and helping those who actually want and need it. The countless misogynistic threads about how women and society aren't fair to men are toxic and don't do anyone any favors. There are better subreddits that would love to discuss these types of concerns with you in a more healthy way. Misandry is as equally intolerable. \n\nAt the end of the day let's lift each other up. Let's share our experiences and learn and/or laugh from them! Ask the questions that need to be asked. But let's not lose sight of what dating is really about.\n\n**EDIT: If you do see any rule breaking behavior please report so that we can take action. It's hard to see every comment. Thanks!**",

        "content": "I recently attended a reunion where the conversation turned to sex and body counts, (which I was so interested about as I'm a virgin and is always being teased by my bff because of it) and I was surprised to find that most of the guys present preferred women with experience. Their reasoning was that experienced women know how to please their partners, whereas virgins require guidance, which can be tiresome. This made me wonder if being a virgin is seen as a drawback. Having saved myself for the right person, it's disheartening to hear that experience might be more valuable to men than emotional connection or other qualities. Is this really what matters most to them?",

            "its definitely the opposite. i lost my virginity when i was 23 because of personal beliefs and from 15-23 i was HOUNDED for that vcard. and i was almost raped a couple times as well for it. my frenemies would always tell guys, and guys would see it as some kind of challenge. it was super exhausting, and they just love the idea of innocent/purity. it's so icky",
            "wait until multiple dudes DM you on here just because you posted this. guys like virgins they fetishize it. I find it gross though as a virgin. I don\u2019t want to be a kink lol",
            "I don\u2019t care I just want someone who\u2019s not going to dislike me",
            "Not a massive deal breaker for me but as someone who is still a virgin ideally I would like the girl to somewhat be in the same boat as me",
            "I prefer women who allow me to be myself, it has nothing to do with sexual experience. Don't really care what your experience is. It's how do you care about my soul",
            "Emotional connection and experience are not mutually exclusive.  You can have both.",
            "The real underlying appeal I would argue is enthusiasm. Women who have had many partners know what they like, and therefore it's more likely the sex is good when you both see that your wants are compatible. But there's many 'inexperienced' people who still learn what they like pretty quickly and are just as enthusiastic as anyone, and they're awesome.\n\nI do think this makes sex with a virgin a bit against the current because you still have to learn about what you like, let alone what your partner does, but there's no guarantee that an experienced lover will be a good one, I've had many starfish lovers that prided themselves on their past experiences, and a common thread there was lack of communication on their part, which is one thing that I would expect you to be stronger than most at the beginning if you are saving yourself for 'the one' and you meet someone that clearly you both love each other enough to finally want to have sex with them.",
            "obligatory people arent a monolith statement.\n\nI personally would prefer to do something with someone who knows how to do it/ what they want.  Dead awkward starfish sex is cool and all but its not my thing.  There are some men who will value this but the overwhelming amount of people who have had sex will prefer someone who knows how to have sex.",
            "I get why that conversation bummed you out. Just because those guys prefer experienced women doesn\u2019t mean everyone does. Your choice to save yourself for the right person is personal and special. The right partner will value that and appreciate you for who you are. Don't let one conversation make you doubt your worth. Stay true to yourself, and the right person will come along!",
            "I think everyone has their own preferences about this",
            "Doesn't matter coz I ain't getting either\ud83e\udd72",
            "I personally like experienced women,bcoz I like women to dominate me. If a virgin girl is of dominative and horny mindset then it's ok for me! The thing that matters is compassion and creativity while love making, understanding each other and love that's it!",
            "There are still many guys who prefer virgin women. Don\u2019t worry and don\u2019t date someone who doesn\u2019t respect your beliefs.",
            "I've never known another man who actually *wants* someone who's \"experienced\", as we usually don't like the idea of someone else having our person before us. Kinda an odd pit of the stomach feel. That said there's alot of guys in the world, so there's definitely *someone* into that...",
            "I never cared about that or ever will. if I love someone, it\u2019s is what it is either u Respekt and accept the past of ur current date or partner or not.",
            "The right person is the right person \nI can see how a Virgin can be a lot more work and responsibilities because of the capacity to be an ass hole if you decide you just want a one night thing or to not see them again",
            "Honestly having more experience doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll be better at sex. When I was with my first boyfriend he was surprised that I didn\u2019t at least give a BJ to someone before because I was good at it. However, when I was with a guy who had way more experience, sex was really unsatisfying, and I basically had to teach him not to violently scrape my insides with his fingers like he\u2019s performing a curettage. And he told me he wouldn\u2019t even bother trying to find my clit, saying it\u2019s impossible and he just can\u2019t do it. So really having slept with many people doesn\u2019t guarantee someone will be a better partner. I think it\u2019s more important to have good communication and passion between the two of you.",
            "Hell no.. Most normal guys don\u2019t want a girl who sleeps around",
            "Nothing beats experience, js",
            "I\u2019m not someone with lot of experience but what I want is mutual concent and respect, it\u2019s just not about making more body counts it\u2019s about enjoying the  moment with the other person.",
            "Preference most of the times want that innocence but in a freaky way \ud83d\ude2d",
            "The jist is if you love the act of sex (learning someone's turn ons, foreplay, mutual enjoyment) then you will prefer expierence. If you want someone who doesn't know your bad or good and you still think coodies are real but you want to say you had sex then virgins seem like the better choice.\n\nI'm not saying your a virgin and you first time is destined to be with someone who's mentally a child I'm just saying what being virgin or not virgin all else equal attracts.",
            "Naaaahh my preference is nothing selected",
            "I've found it doesn't make a difference tbh... \ud83e\udd23 As crass as it sounds, as long as she can guide me in/slide me back in, it's all the same. Sex is enjoyable, as long as she's putting effort into it and having a good time, it doesn'#t matter\n\nHandjobs... all the women I've been with seem to be under the impression is a grip the skin and yank it, idk why. experienced or not, didn't make a difference. I've had to tell them, it hurts to do that lol\n\nAnd for the record, ***everyone*** needs guidance during sex, just because one partner enjoyed it one way, doesn't mean ***everyone*** enjoys it that way. Sex is about communication too. It must be a porn thing, that you just fuck em' all the same and they love it.",
            "Some men will fetishize virginity.\n\n\nSome will romanticize it.\n\n\nSome won't care.\n\n\nSome won't want the \"baggage\" that can come with it.\n\n\n\nSociety is weird about virginity in men and women in different ways, which means people are going to be weird about it. And whole there's a lot of romanticized about two people being each other's firsts... honestly both of those people are going to be better off with their first being someone who A. Knows what they're doing. B. Knows what they like and how to communicate it. And C. Respects the other person's boundaries and right to a mutually enjoyable experience.\n\n\nNow, a bad first can be more unpleasant for women than men for simple physiological reasons, but a bad first can negatively impact how either views sex in the long term.",
            "It doesn't bother, we all got to start somewhere. Save yourself for the right person, dont jump into bed because you feel pressured into it, it is fun at first but it gets boring after awhile, if theres no passion it's pointless.",
            "Personally, I don't care, or didn't care in the time in my life where it was relevant.\n\nEvery new partner is a teaching experience, if you're doing it right.",
            "A good man will want to be your one and only. Your bff needs to leave you alone, fyi she is likely jealous",
            "I just like women",
            "Virgins should pair with virgins the worst is when a virgin chick gets used by a bad boy then left. As a guy I\u2019d prefer a casual relationship be with experience but I don\u2019t want an experienced girl as a wife",
            "The whole weird virgin fetish is for creeps and kids. When I was younger I didn't mind to help girls find themselves. I took my time and we tried a lot of things. I pleasured them in many ways. Now I just don't care about sex as much. I prefer having less but high quality sex over a lot of bad, slow or boring sex. I'm 30 and mostly date older women because they're very wild, fun and open in bed. I never asked and yet they always eat my ass. They always sit on my face instead of worrying about a lot of non-sense. They actually give good blowjobs which is honestly uncommon with women under 30. \n\nOf course, for an actual serious and long term relationship I need more than good sex but once again, older women are usually more emotionally intelligent, more mature and reliable. They also have a lot more to talk about. I love to date women between 32-38 for something serious.",
            "The thought originated along with the \u201cwomen are property\u201d mindset. Most of the guys I know (early to mid 30s) are sexually active themselves but want to marry a virgin.",
            "I am totally against this. Boys love virgin girls more than experienced ones. I never heard from any male guys interested in the experienced one. They only talk about this when they are in a friends-with-benefits type of relation or a temporary relationship. Also, this is just not about being a virgin or experienced it's more about whether this person will stay loyal and be there for them for a long-lasting relationship or she will in future find some faults and say goodbye. Many of the virgins are seen to have a patience mindset rather than to hookup with anyone.",
            "There are two kinds of guys who care about virginity - sweet, Mormon-esque guys who REALLY care about soulmates and wanting to wait together for marriage\u2026and absolute fucking creeps who only see women as sexual property. Both are creepy, but the Mormonesque guy get\u2019s a pass from me if he walks the walk and acts with respect. The other guy is the absolute fucking worst.  \n  \nPersonally, I want a woman who\u2019s experienced and knows what she wants.",
            "Depends, but yeah I do. I recently broke stuff off with someone mostly because she was a virgin in her late 30s (I'm M41). That we'd probably be sexually incompatible was one thing, but the real red flag was that she'd never been in a relationship before. I just wasn't up for being someone's first of everything at this stage in life.",
            "For relationships? Nope. \nFor casual? Yes!",
            "no one wants a shy starfish",
            "All my boyfriends did. They said I rocked their world, versus their dead starfish exes.",
            "I've had a relatively large amount of sex with both. Specifically 6 virgins, and A LOT of experienced women. \nI definitely prefer experienced women for the down and dirty sex, but also treated the virgins who chose to share themselves with me for the first time with the same high levels of consideration, respect and reverence as all of my other partners...we just approached things slower, and with more caution. \n\nOnce you've done something, you can't un-do it. Be certain that it's what you want to do and be kind to yourself throughout the process :)",
            "For me for example, it's don't matter. I just prefer big girls",
            "I have never taken a woman's virginity, so I wouldn't know. It's a compelling idea, but that window closed a long time ago for me.",
            "It depends on the guy. Frankly, even with 'experienced' people, there can be learning curves with different lovers since not everyone is the same. And when it comes to 'guiding' a virgin, some guys might certainly find it tiresome, but plenty wouldn't care or might even enjoy that part.",
            "Very few men would say this matters MOST. I think you might have misinterpreted what they were saying. It sounds like they were talking about the narrow issue of sex and intimacy and said they prefer experienced partners over virgins, that's not the same thing as saying that that's the most important part of a relationship or that they value that over emotional connection. \n\nAs for the question itself, each man has his preference. Personally I agree with them, I would prefer a woman who had experience. But I also more than anything want someone who gives a shit about me, who I get along with, who I enjoy being around. If I met that person and they happened to be a virgin then I wouldn't toss them aside just for that. I might feel pressure to perform, sure, but if I liked them that much I would want to please them and make them feel good. And by contrast, there are men out there who actively prefer virgins to women with experience. It's far from a unanimous opinion among men.",
            "Nope, I'd prefer it",
            "I don\u2019t care either way. But I appreciate a loyal, kind, and loving woman who can be my teammate and my equal partner against the chaos of the world. \n\nBut also a silly and maybe a little feisty one too xD",
            "I personally think so. Because some of guys want to enjoy sex with experienced bhabi type women. Bhabhi look very gorgeous and sensually attractive and boys keept in mind that these woman give real pleasure because they experienced.",
            "I got 0 so I don\u2019t mind at all. I feel like the laws to dating and sex is that if you are a virgin, then you must only seek out other virgins. No if\u2019s or buts about this. So ya, I get what you are feeling.  At some point you will feel bad about not meeting societal and social expectations.",
            "Not me, I\u2019d rather my gf/wife be a virgin over being sexually experienced. I think part of the fun for me is exploring, growing and learning together.",
            "I do",
            "No\n\nIt's actually the opposite if anything",
            "Depends on what type of guys you are mixing with. Creeps, conservatives & religious guys would tend to prefer virgins whilst most normal liberal guys probably want some experience/it doesn\u2019t bother them a whole lot.",
            "NOOOOOOOO IF A GUY EVER SAYS THIS HE\u2019S LYING TO U",
            "Before I had sex I wanted a virgin girl, because I saved up myself, right \ud83d\ude02 And afterwards I was okay with not virgin girls. Ah the lies we tell ourselves! So this preference depends only on circumstances and conditionings.",
            "A lot of guys prefer to dare experienced women - usually easier and less effort. Many of these same guys want to commit to/have long term relationships with/marry virgins or at least much less experienced women. If you're saving yourself for the \"right one\", your being a virgin should not be a problem - as long as you are ok with his double standards on who to date/hookup with vs who to build relationships with. Most don't consider sexually available or experienced women to be capable of serious relationships and keeping commitments made...despite the fact that they believe themselves to be trustworthy regardless of sexual experience and history. They'd tell you it's different for men and women for all sorts of completely ludicrous reasons.\n\nI'd say - if a guy values you just for being a virgin while he has played around a lot - be wary of him. He'd have double standards in other things too. If he sets the same/similar standards for himself, he'd make a better partner. But there are not too many of those out there. But there are so me. Good luck",
            "If someone has never had sex, I can accept that. It's okay if someone isn't experienced. I respect a person who isn't just passing it out. I'm never just passing it out, myself. And I just can't fetishize virgins because I honestly prefer someone with at least a little experience.",
            "Beggars can\u2019t be choosers\u2026",
            "I prefer sexually open and sexually curious women. That can be a virgin, too. I want to have fun with her, I don't want to have persuade somebody, because I need strong consent.",
            "I personally don't find it creep. Believe me there are soooo many guys out there who are still virgin and just wait for the right moment cause for them it's not just sex but making love to a person that melt to. You're just in the wrong app \ud83d\ude14",
            "Depends on the guy's experience in sex with both actually. But as a guy, I'd prefer virgins more than sexually experience ones since there's no pressure or occasions to rise above to. You're just there for the experience and pleasure of it. Then again, it's just me.",
            "Nah 98% of men in my circle don't even consider that whether that woman experienced or not",
            "I prefer more dominant women in bed ..",
            "I accept who accept me either they have experience or not. In the end of the day we are just humans who wants to love and to be loved",
            "48M I\u2019ve never been with a virgin and wouldn\u2019t want to be. Just from the few that weren\u2019t virgins but had little experience\u2026\u2026..nope.",
            "Not really",
            "Yes. Only fkn weirdos refer virgins. I like loose holes.",
            "Well majority of us prefer women, experience or not doesn't matter.",
            "Honestly?? I don\u2019t care either way. What I want is chemistry, personality, and compatibility.\n\nI will say that touch and sex is an important part of my ability to feel intimacy with someone. And intimacy is important to me in a long term relationship. Not just straight penetration but sexual acts in general. It\u2019s one of the big ways I get close with someone. \n\nIf you want to be celibate until marriage then that is a deal breaker for me personally. No shade on you for that btw.\n\nBut if you just want to be sure you\u2019re losing it to a good guy I completely respect that too and I\u2019d be willing to put sex on the back burner for the time being if my chemistry with the girl is NUTS. It\u2019s all subjective lol.",
            "I honestly prefer someone with some experience. Doesn\u2019t have to be crazy pro experience but at least someone who knows what they\u2019re doing. Now if it\u2019s someone who\u2019s a freak like me then omg I\u2019m all for it!!",
            "As Virgin I hoped I find a good Virgin not that I care too much still",
            "Not really, what any man or woman will find more interesting is chemistry. Intercourse is also about communication as everyone has different reactions to certain stimuli and preferences such as roleplay or roleplaying. Long story short everyone is different and learning about your partner will always be more preferable than any sexually experienced person.",
            "Yes.",
            "I (27M) am also virgin and I see the situation as that : if the woman I\u2019ll be with is virgin, then cool we will progress and learn together.\nIf the woman I\u2019ll be with is experienced cool she can guide me (and I\u2019ll do everything with eagerness just to prove her I\u2019m worth too compared to others)",
            "At this point, just any woman would do",
            "Its more fun, easier going and stressles. Otherwise they must enjoy being a teacher. How will one dance not knowing the moves?",
            "Flat no. \n\nNot especially virgins, but 'experienced' in women can come with a LOT of other baggage. \n\nNot generally, but it absolutely us something to be careful of, when you're a guy looking for a long term partner.\n\nFor guys, there's a massive difference between sex and relationships, and 'less experienced' women with good character are more likely to end up in the long-term relationship category. \n\n...now I'll await the barrage of hate from the 'experienced' ladies...",
            "I'm not a guy, but I'm sure if someone likes you, I mean REALLY likes you or even loves ou, they won't care. I was 23 when I lost my virginity and the guy wasn't even my bf. We just really had the chemistry and attraction and I wanted to do it and with him, he was a nice person, I trusted him etc etc. \n\nI told him and he seemed surpised, but gave no sign that this would bother him and he was nice. I think I nice person will know and understand that this has nothing to do w your personality. I wasn't too shy or prude bc I was a virgin. I wanted him so bad, it was the most natural thing and it broke down the walls. I used to stress SO much about my virginity before I lost it, bc I thought ppl will think I'm weird or something. Meanwhile I was waiting for the great love and it did not come for so long. So I let that idea go, that I'd loose it with the perfect person, cuz there's no such a thing called perfect place or person or time. And then he came, how I was into so much sexually, and we did not end up together (for various reasons), but it's still a fond memory. \n\nAnd ever since I know indeed, that it doesn't change anything.",

It doesn't bother me, but at a certain point I feel like, maybe it's not a good idea to sleep with this person on occasion, because they are exposed to a ton of germs. It also really depends on who a girl is having sex with. If she was having sex with femboys, I wouldn't care a bit, or other girls for that matter, but if she is being run through by like convicts and meth heads, then yeah I'm going to have a problem with that. It disgusts me. \n\nWhat is the appeal of virginity? \n\nTo some it is the idea of a girl who is naive, and will stay with them, for others it's Chasity, and also the idea that someone loves a person for being themselves or something. To me that comes off as very manipulative and weird. Personally I'd rather a girl be happy and date who she wants. I'm not really the type to want ownership of someone. I'm more looking for someone who is on my level and has similar values to me, and enjoys sexuality. Most of the reason I date is because I went to cuddle and do other things. If not for that, there isn't much reason for me to put up with a lady, unless she is naturally just very cool like a cool person to hang out with. Those girls are highly sought after, so dating them isn't the best prospect.",

And whoever tells you differently they just lying themselves.\nAlso might be the case he has a fantasy of fuckin two women at the same time.

I'm sure it feels like you're trapped in many regards, and I hope you can find yourself and find what's best for you.\n\nI understand the BDSM dynamic, and while you've given so much power to your partner, in the long run the power really lies with you. He can go only as far with you as your safe word. So in essence, haven't you been giving the safe word?\n\nSo what are you going to do? Are you going to respect yourself and your boundaries?\n\nI'm a big fan of relationships and in particular marriages and while it's easy for others to say just drop the guy and walk away, that's one approach. If the relationship has value, perhaps you need to seek out some professional counseling to see if you can resolve this issue. I think that process could resolve this issue, and potentially others in the future, one way or another.\n\nBut please listen to your gut, respect yourself, respect your boundaries and hang firm on enforcing them.

Every woman and every guy, and every relationship is different. Although many may align in certain ideas and desires. If a woman doesn\u2019t want their man masturbating, I personally believe that out of all the soft and hard limits that someone could have, that\u2019s kinda an odd one. However, it\u2019s the responsibility of the two in the relationship to figure out the dynamics and ways something like that can work for them. This aim is so both of them are satisfied, and agreeable to the chosen solution of this *friction*\ud83d\ude09 that is causing issues between them. \n\nEvery person has the right to their autonomy, and every person has a right to feel hurt, frustrated, angry, all the feelings. And every person has the right to desire the kind of life they wish to live (without their SO masturbating?\ud83d\udc40). But a relationship is a partner dance, and in order for it to be a graceful, and beautiful one, they need to give and take, and agree on the way they decide to move together. Typically, A man leads, but a woman shines. This means a man must be certain in the choices he makes, but those choices also must be reasonable and achievable for the woman he\u2019s dancing with to be able to gracefully demonstrate her mastery over the domain the move allows her. (Same goes for her choices and his response to them, don\u2019t be a dick.) If they cannot agree, or they cannot share the balance of the dance-floor, then they need to find a new dance partner that works well with how they both enjoy to move. This is a metaphor for teamwork, and collaboration, and also compromise. \n\nSometimes problems and issues are tricky, sometimes it\u2019s just little fumbles throughout the dance. Hopefully they both love and enjoy each other throughout the process of stumbling about. We all need to have leniency when the other isn\u2019t perfectly adept at keeping a dance, every dance, at the standard which an Olympic multi-time gold-medalist may be capable of. (We all make mistakes, fuck up, or annoy our partner at our idiocy/incompetence sometimes, try not to keep your standards too high about stupid shit. \ud83d\ude02)We need to respect that we can be shit at dancing, maybe it\u2019s a bad day, or maybe we\u2019re new to the tango when we typically waltz. Either way, we need to be kind and compassionate and flexible when choosing what has true meaning to us in the ways our partners moves even if it bugs the crap out of us on occasion. It may just be a little bump in the road but could also help in our journey of growing closer and being better dancers together. \n\n\ud83d\udc83 \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83e\uddbd\n\nTldr \ud83e\udd54: just let the bro masturbate if he wants to, don\u2019t backseat drive his penis \ud83d\ude02",

            "Damn. I thought you were taking the piss lol",
            "LOOOL, Spread indeed.",
            "Lmao xD I\u2019m glad you\u2019re having fun with it, as you should be \n\nI hope you enjoy masturbating to dr Ruth and dancing with your Karen\u2019s \ud83d\ude02 be good brother! \ud83c\udf7b",
            "wow, I mean, I don't know her reasons, so I won't judge, but that's kinda new. \n\nidk maybe she was worried about porn addiction or something.",
            "I disagree. Nothing and no one exists outside of my direct realm of comprehension. You\u2019re not real either, figment of my imagination.",
            "The more you answer the more weird it becomes. So continue answering please",
            "some girls are just weird. was married to this girl for 4 years had sex almost every day and never saw her vagina. she always covered it out of insecurity for some dumb reason, so shed always have her hand on it and play with it as an excuse almost to cover it up. I could make a whole post about this chick and the crazy shit she did. Wouldn't let me go down on her unless we were under the covers in the dark, shed record me during sex but keep the videos to herself. shit goes on.",
            "Yes her main commodity. Why else is she withholding sex and not something else? Why is it often the case with women who hold some kind of grudge or resentment towards their partner, or they want them to do something that they withhold exactly that thing. Because of the list that men need the most in a partner, sex comes first and all the rest comes next.\n\nSo basically she's not doing her duty and the man should not be obligated to fulfill his duty in return then. A man's main commodity in a relationship is the things she expects automatically from him, aka his duty, his role, Regular sex isn't number 1 for women., however protecting, providing and catering to her emotions are.",
            "No one is gonna be OK with no sex and no masturbation.  Not a single guy on earth.  You will only find people willing to lie about it.  Congrats you made sure your partner is a liar",
            "him or me ? \ud83d\ude02",
            "Reddit is my new porn",
            "Nah I just think she wants to be the ONLY girl her boyfriend looks at. Her bf and her were broken up for a little while recently, and what she was most sad about was that she was his first in everything and that she won\u2019t find another guy \u201euntouched\u201c again\u2026 which I found super weird too, but whatever",
            "It\u2019s not new it\u2019s actually a fairly common take",
            "What's \"weird\" about ending gender inequality by asking my boyfriend to self-administer a handy-j with just 1 or 2 friends of mine and whoever is tuned in to the Instagram live?",
            "no one said anything about no sex \ud83d\ude02 damn men are dense these days huh my topic was not about no sex if u and your partner aren\u2019t having sex & u have to masterbate so much maybe you guys aren\u2019t meant for one another lol",
            "Not you lol",
            "I decided to add footnotes and a tldr when things started sounding confusing \ud83d\ude02",
            "It's new *to me*. I need to brush up on all my porn takes.",
            "You could do better",
            "no one was talking to you, the comment I responded to called the person vile when he said if there is no sex, the man will masterbate.  I responded to her, and told her no one is going to be ok with no sex and no masterbation.",
            "yes he\u2019s vile just his view on things shows why he got issues \ud83d\ude02",
            "I already did your mom.",
            "he brought up rape & cheating as an example to what he said i think he\u2019s vile",
            "I think I\u2019m in love with you",
            "I wasn't talking to him either, and you were not the one who called him vile.  I was responding directly to the comment made."
