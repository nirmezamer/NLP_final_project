Rani. To really check if there is difference in pay, the question to ask whether actors playing Aamir's father and mother are being paid the same. Or whether male or female assistant directors or spot boys or idk, grips or something get paid the same.",
            "Ofcourse he is right. I mean even within male actors, a Salman Khan will be paid more than a Kay Kay Menon even though Kay Kay might act way better but really who is pulling in the crowds. Its the reverse in the fashion industry where the female models make more money because fashion mostly revolves around women.",
            "Aamir's on point here. \n\nAt the end of the day, it's demand-supply. You need to support women-centric movies, so that producers make more of those. Crew was a success.

Its not that we are not there, in the past likes of Sridevi where actual crowd pullers, ofcourse the numbers are skewed but there is still hope when a Crew opens to almost double digit headlined by three female actors in comparison to steaming pile of garbage like BMCM headlined by two supposedly big starts who take renumeration equal to the budget of the Crew.",

If the metric is \"who fills the theatre\", then you should find two movies with a hero and heroine with similar ticket sales, and see what their pay is.\n\nBut the truth of the matter is that it isn't just who fills the theatres. It is also how much the actor costs and whether or not the people hiring these actors want to hire certain people. If the average person thinks that women deserve less money then men, then you should see that reflected in the offers the actresses get.\n\nAnd we have already seen heavy wage-gap studies between men and women that indicate that there is a wage gap, controlled for everything else.

Two lead actors, male and female, should be paid equally if they\u2019re carrying the same amount of weight. Actors fill the seat in theatres, not spotboys. it\u2019s the collective star power of the three lead actors that draw the audience. For Talash, were all 3 of you paid equally? Highly doubt it. Remuneration in Bollywood has never based on post movie sales but pre-determined star value. \n\nWhy are the 3 khans paid more? -> because they draw audiences -> why do they draw audiences -> because they\u2019re portrayed to be the macho saviors pandering to the Indian society -> what do they do about it -> they take up more roles that reinforces this thinking and get paid even more! \n\nSo Aamir, try this first, \n\n1) how about don\u2019t take up roles that reinforce the importance of a \u201cman\u201d in the movie. Why couldn\u2019t Rani have been the cop in Talaash?, 2) actively go seek roles which demand more from the female actors without stealing their spotlight, 3) create a level playing field and then talk pay equity",
            "While amir is completely right on his point but look at the other side of the coin. \nPrabhas took 150cr for kalki, also took a huge sum for salaar and saaho(both of which tanked).

There are exceptions and times are certainly changing now but this has largely been the case for the history of the industry.\n\nThat is what needs to change. How will talented female actors get fairly rewarded when 90% of the movies they\u2019re in don\u2019t even hire and pay them for their abilities but for their looks. The default movie structure (which puts male star in the center), the writing(which gives most dialogue, screen time and agency to the male lead), this is the issue.",

You can't blame Akki for charging a high fee if the market is willing to pay that high fee. The only way to counter that is the audience opting for more content driven, smaller budget films. That's how the star era ended in Hollywood. Audiences started preferring the more indie, content driven cinema than those that were sold just on the name of the stars.

Can't risk it for a film role in another country sadly.\nI mean he honoured his commitments and they still took away/cancelled whatever his role.\n\nThose vindictive, insecure bastards!\ud83e\udd2c",
