We also hear \"well have to look back later to see if there is an update\" a lot and, while there may not be one, I think it would be cool to actually have an update on some of these stories if the original poster is giving them. I know this isn't possible for all stories, and I know not every story needs an update, but I just feel like lately its been heavy on the \"checking back\" without actually doing so.",

The whole podcast is about having hot takes. People CAN DISAGREE and that doesn\u2019t make them a bad person.\n\nThis is in relation to the gestational diabetes story. I saw a lot of comments popping off as if the podcast was spouting something unhinged when in reality they were just acknowledging that being pregnant isn\u2019t an excuse to control someone else\u2019s food choice. I won\u2019t say who I agree with in the story because it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s not my podcast. The whole point is to start discussion about the story which is what all three of them did. I\u2019m really sorry the comments were so unreasonable and negative over literally nothing. It\u2019s a podcast. It\u2019s not that serious. Opinions are not OBJECTIVE or black and white.

Morgan, Lauren, Justin, and Chris were great engaging and overall very crowd friendly.\nHowever. Jerry was another story. I cannot underestimate just how creepy he was. He came around pre-show and showed off his socks and engaged with the crowd. No big deal, write that off as a pandering. When the show started he was nowhere to be seen so didn't give it a second thought. Then, maybe halfway through the show, \"Papa Predator\" showed up. He frequently engaged with the women of the crowd and then gave shots to the presenters. Ok, getting a little strange but can write it off as showmanship. Then he started going on about how his dick was burning due to an episode with spermicide that he stuck up his dick be a lot plan he was with didn't want to use a diaphragm. As he had his arm around his daughter. I came away very creeped out and he gave off extreme groomer vibes. I get open family vibes, and maybe I'm telling on myself, but this was just really creepy and convinced me to never listen to his podcast ever again. He comes across as this reasonable dad who is wholesome and looks out for everyone. He is essentially the opposite.\nCannot underestimate how creepy and unauthentic he came across.",

Sorry to do this to y\u2019all, but whenever I hear it, it sounds like someone frantically yelling (in slow motion) \u201cGet Maria out!!\u201d As if there was a house fire and Maria was stuck. The second time it loops it sounds like \u201cTake the chicken out, get the chicken out!\u201d, presumably from the freezer?\n\n What do you all hear?",
            "Could we get an episode where the theme is parents hooking up with their children's ex, friends, or just generally someone related to them that they shouldn't? We get a few stories like these and I feel like their are probably enough for a full episode.",

During another incident, I was cornered alone in the school bathroom and confronted about my Jewish beliefs. Fortunately, the individual cornering me left me alone because he decided that since Jesus was Jewish I had to be alright.\n\nMy parents found out about one of these incidents through a third party (I never complained to my parents about the abuse). They confronted the school administrators who said, \"we hate graffiti of all kinds.\" (That's about as tone deaf as saying \"all lives matter\" in response to anti-Black racism.)\n\nLater in college and at one of my professional jobs, my co-workers and and classmates repeatedly made antisemitic jokes at my expense. On another occasion I had to stay at a friend's house for hours because it was not safe to walk home, because there was a random person (whom I had not interacted with) yelling antisemitic slurs at me from across the street. Since it was Shabbat (the Jewish sabbath), I did not have my car and while I felt threatened enough not to be outside alone, I did not feel that I was sufficiently threatened to break Shabbat and call the police.\n\nIn the aftermath of the October 7th massacre it took days for my wife (who had great-grandparents killed in the Holocaust) to let me walk home alone a night from the synagogue. Ever since high school, when I go out in public alone, I frequently evaluate how likely it might be for me to be the victim of an antisemitic attack. When I hear a loud noise in the synagogue part of me wonders if it might be a terrorist attack.\n\nJust because you weren't born Jewish does not mean that you can't experience antisemitism.",

I feel like we\u2019re circling the drain on semantics, but let me try again.\u263a\ufe0f\n\nThe context of my original comment is that the host, Morgan, essentially said that recent world events have been hard for her because she\u2019s Jewish. While in past episodes she has said she \u201cfeels Jewish\u201d. My critique was ultimately that, especially in light of what Jews are facing (Palestinians are facing unspeakable atrocities as well - this is not a political commentary), it is in poor taste to claim to be Jewish and imply that you resonate with the Jewish experience due to being Jewish yourself, when you are not in fact Jewish. \n\nThe question of religion is of course more nuanced than ethnicity. However, in that context, she was not expressing the feeling of being connected to the experience through religion. The distinction is important.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019m not trying to imply that facing antisemitism is the qualifier for being Jewish. Rather being ethnically Jewish is the qualifier for being Jewish. And only those who are ethnically Jewish will face antisemitism. Judaism, as a religion is of course open to all ethnicities. The experience of being Jewish and facing antisemitism is not (even if you practice Judaism).\n\n***edit to add. I just read and replied to a comment further down that was really important to this conversation. I\u2019m tempted to delete a portion of this comment but I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge when we misunderstand/misspeak. I was wrong to say that antisemitism is exclusive to ethnicity. Someone below generously shared their experience of converting to Judaism.\n\nThat being said\u2026 in keeping with the original context of my statement, I think there is an important distinction from \u201cfeeling Jewish\u201d/saying \u201cI\u2019m Jewish\u201d and the practice of true, devout Orthodox Judaism and facing persecution in light of that. Again, in keeping with the context of my original statement, I do still think it is inappropriate for someone who is not ethnically Jewish and who does not practice Judaism to claim to be Jewish because they, in their own words, \u201cfeel Jewish\u201d. \n\nIf it turns out that Morgan is in fact practicing Orthodox Judaism, putting her in danger of persecution, my entire critique is completely unnecessary and I fold\ud83e\udee1",

I can't speak to that element, having not yet listened to a THT podcast (I literally came here today looking for an index). For what it's worth I doubt anti-semites limit themselves to ethnic Jews, and I don't personally think we need a litmus test for Judaism. Rather I think your distinction is important (ethnicity vs religion) in some types of discussion, but I still think people that practice Judaism (regardless of orthodoxy) can identify as Jewish. I don't think it takes from anyone else. Then again, I also don't think religious and ethnic distinctions should carry as much weight as they seem to so perhaps my views on this topic are an outlier.",

            "For the first story, I can completely understand how hard it is to show scars. Especially ones linked to trauma. It's not  exactly the same, but I have severe scarring on my shoulders/back, and people are unbelievably cruel about them. It took me a lot to start wearing clothing that showed that part of me again, but I cannot handle heat and live in a very hot city, so I finally caved. Intense therapy helped as well, but even then it produced a lot of anxiety every time I went out showing my shoulders/back in public. One of the first times I went in public with them showing, I went to the zoo, and at the tiger exhibit one mom went on and on to her little daughter about how it looked like I was a victim of a tiger attack, how ugly the scars were. Before they were fully healed, so before all the therapy and when I would still cover them up, my dad pulled my shirt down my shoulders to show a dog trainer we were interviewing with, nearly costing me my chance to get a service dog I desperately needed because of concern about the safety of the home the dog would be going to. I used to love swimming, but I still have trouble going into a pool if there are others there. So, long story short, I understand the OP's partner being easily triggered by it, and that's without the connection to his mom passing. I couldn't imagine having that on top of everything else. Even the people who aren't cruel will ask about scars, never mind that you might be uncomfortable or upset by talking about them. In that case it's not cruelty, more obliviousness and ignorance, but it is still a nasty thing to get hit with. I don't know if I'm making any sense, but yeah.... OP's partner is totally justified in his feelings, but I hope he gets some help to work through it. Maybe his first therapist didn't click, and that's why it didn't help. It's a lot like finding the right puzzle piece, I went through soooo many therapists before I found one that I actually made progress with.",

Her brother wasn't aware of her breaking up and moving in, etc. At least he didn't know the full situation. Comments told her she was delulu because army PTSD isn't exactly something you can fix with a hug and a smile.",

I can\u2019t believe she even asked to bring her baby on a weekend trip. Is this AirB&B even set up to be baby appropriate? \n\nI would have spoken up, too. Yes, it is a celebration for the bride but I personally would be *pissed* if I was spending all that money on the trip & was super excited to let loose with friends, only to be informed about a last-minute addition of a *baby*. Hell no. It completely changes the logistics and it\u2019s going to be a nightmare. The friend with a baby needs to understand that her decision ti have a baby should not affect others negatively, and this is going to affect at least 7 people. How is the mom friend expecting to participate in the festivities? How is she going to manage a quiet sleeping place for the baby and not having all of you woken up by crying? And this house could be a death trap, depending upon the age of the kid and the quality of parenting. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry. These moms who think & behave like they are the same people and that they can live exactly the same way after having babies is so very annoying, because they can\u2019t, and that thinking ensures other adults are going to be annoyed.",

Even if it wasn\u2019t drinking-focused, it would just be so inconvenient to deal with nap schedules, finding quiet places to nurse (because 7 months olds are super distractible), and rearranging everything to be at child-friendly venues (ie not bars). I can totally see why she wouldn\u2019t want to be without her baby for a couple of days, especially if she\u2019s breastfeeding, but that just means that she either shouldn\u2019t go or she should plan to have her spouse watch the baby for a short time so she can come for part of the party.",

I'm like \"oh honey.... People don't get shrieky loud and wild unless their drunk or in middle school.\" It wasn't that it was a bad party, it was a nice evening, but when you hear the wordz bachelorette party, you think something different.

If I'm drinking (which if I was bar hopping I'd obviously be drinking) I sure AF don't want to be drunk around a baby. Between trying to be quite or even just nursing a hangover with the crying, like no. To all of it. I'd be the asshole for blowing it off and not coming. \n\nThe bride ultimately has final say, but I think this decision is going to end up with someone having hurt feelings- either the mom for having to sit out on the fun, the bride for having to skip out on activities because she doesn't want the mom to feel left out, or the other party attendees because they can't get wild and crazy, they have to tiptoe around a baby or help with the baby because mom needs a shower or wants to drink at least one of the nights.",

Not all babies cry all night either, my girls were super quiet babies and slept through most nights. But anyways, I do think it\u2019s weird for her to bring the baby and not appropriate based on the setting you described, but I think it should have been the brides decision or the bridesmaid\u2019s (aka party planner).

A bride\u2019s secret service that can advocate for her. Once you have that going, you can talk to the bride (or not) and ask if she\u2019s ok with that.

There's no cot or other kind of baby bed at the place we're staying, so how are you solving that? \n\nEventually just say straight up that you won't come of there's a baby there because this is not even remotely appropriate for a baby and that you will not she'll out money for a weekend dictated by a baby and it's mother when the intention was a fun bachelorette.",

If the friend with the baby doesn\u2019t have this option maybe there\u2019s some alternative like participating in the daytime activities and staying behind for the bar hopping. Being a parent comes with compromises, after all. So OP, while you\u2019re NTA in this situation, maybe everyone could have tried to see if there\u2019s some alternative solution.",

If that's the case and she has someone to watch the baby while attending all the events then it's not as big of a problem as long as the bride is okay with it. The only real issue is if she plans to come with the baby and not bring someone to watch the baby while everyone parties. Everyone is jumping in saying N T A but this is the bride's event so if she wants this person there and they can make reasonable accommodations around the baby then that should be up to the bride.",

The arrangement was she would hang out with us all day and do the drinking and fun things we had planned. Then at night she went home to the baby and we stayed at our Airbnb. BUT when it actually came to it, she brought the baby over for our Friday night cocktails, took up most of St Patty\u2019s day with the baby and going to a flower farm for baby activities, and brought the baby to both boozy brunches. And on the next day instead of our bars, we went to a winery so she could bring the baby. We were mad since our full day St Pattys turned into most of a day of baby time and she had to go home to drop the baby off before dinner and never did meet up for the drinks. But she didn\u2019t want to do all that  alone so one of our friends had to go with her. She promised the baby wouldn\u2019t be a big deal but it most definitely became a weekend all about her. I honestly wouldn\u2019t have minded a chill baby weekend, it just wasn\u2019t es the weekend we planned and we\u2019re excited for.",

No one else should be forced to adjust their plans for her and the baby, so at most I could see her just being at the house the whole time. Babies have nap times and bed times, not all babies sleep well or sleep well in a new  environment. This woman will be caring for her baby 24 hours a day. Yeah, she does that at home, but the amount of crap she would have to take along with her to care for the baby alone would make me just stay at home. If she came and brought her baby, she would not have any fun and it would be exhausting. If she did have any fun, it would be because she made other guests take care of her baby while she had fun. She\u2019s being very selfish by not thinking about the needs of her child or the needs of the other party guests. It sucks to not go to fun things when you have a baby and the baby can\u2019t come (I\u2019ve missed several no-kid weddings due to having a newborn at the time), but this is what you sign up for when you become a parent. Your life changes in big awesome ways, and no one else\u2019s life changes along with yours in the same way.",

            "Why did she realize this right before the trip?",
            "I\u2019m old school and all bachelorette parties I attended, and my own, were a single night of a great meal, then bar hopping, lots of bad dick jokes and then a raging hangover.  So the idea of multiday \u201cparties\u201d is foreign to me.  But, I have gone on long weekend trips with friends where the itinerary was things like fine dining, a club or two, maybe a show at a theater.  Most of which are not doable with a 7 month old in tow.  The mother is insane with bringing an infant to an ADULT weekend. I\u2019m not a parent, however when I host events I attempt to make at least some of them family friendly so everyone can attend, but others are absolutely for the grown ups because sometimes that\u2019s needed too.  And  if someone said to me \u201chey, I know this event is going to be drinking, late night and loud music, however I need to bring my toddler too\u201d, I\u2019d have to tell them \u201cI fully understand your child has to be your first priority, however this particular event is a 21+ event, so if you\u2019re not able to attend because of your family, I understand and I\u2019ll hopefully see you at the next family inclusive event\u201d.  In the case of OP, if the bride supposedly doesn\u2019t mind, I\u2019d be bowing out of the event, because it will 100 percent, without a doubt, not be the event she agreed to and planned to attend.  It\u2019s very possible that the bride, her friend and baby, plus anyone else who does choose to go can have a good time.  But if I signed up to be going to an art exhibit, then 8 pm dinner reservations at a high end restaurant, followed by bar hopping and then sleeping in and relaxing by the pool the following day, then the event changed to a morning at the zoo, lunch at the AirB&B, followed by 2 hour naps, then dinner at the local family joint a la Red Robin or similar, and maybe wine on the patio after with bedtime around 9:30 pm, I\u2019d bail.  The second option is a day I\u2019ve absolutely enjoyed with members of my family, however it\u2019s likely not what OP agreed to.",
            "Seriously. Can you imagine what it would be like at the Airbnb? I mean the Airbnb is hardly just for sleeping, it\u2019s for pregaming the drinking and having loud fun in the kitchen and stuff. But it would be \u201cOK we need to turn the music off now and keep it down, the baby is sleeping\u2026oh and don\u2019t use the bathroom in that bedroom for getting ready, the baby is sleeping\u2026.\u201d\n\nNo fucking thank you. I wouldn\u2019t go. You couldn\u2019t pay me to go.",
            "Exactly.  I don\u2019t have kids, but I have many, many friends and family who do, ranging from newborn to late middle school.  Their children should be their first priority, and it\u2019s 100 percent a noble sacrifice to have kids (I always thought I would; life just didn\u2019t pan out that way for me).  But there are times and places that are just for the adults, and bachelor and bachelorette parties are one of them.  If mom can\u2019t/won\u2019t be away from her baby for a few nights, then sorry, she can stay home and then she and bride could go do something like brunch and mani/pedis or whatever a different day, where she would only have to be gone for some hours.",

We are there to chill, and frankly, having any child there would completely ruin the whole vibe of the weekend. My aunt told her own adult daughter to stay home because she couldn't get a babysitter for her baby. She wanted to just come for the afternoon with the baby and was still told no. \n\nSo OP NTA, your friends all are, though, for not backing you because we all know they were all thinking exactly what you said but were too cowardly to be honest about it.

Or if she expects you all to completely change the itinerary. Honestly it\u2019s pretty lame for the bride to be copping out and being so passive about this. She sounds very non-confrontational to a detriment. Obviously this mom doesn\u2019t need to be shouted at or anything like that, but this is more than just logistics, the welfare of a young child is at play here.\n\nPlus attending a bach party requires preparation, time, and money so if the entire plan is going to be different from what was originally agreed upon then everyone deserves to know that before committing to the trip entirely or changing any bookings/reservations for activities during the trip.",

            "Oh yeah for sure\u2026if I don\u2019t have my kids I don\u2019t want to even see another kid.",
            "Not to mention how old is the baby? Would all the women be vaccinated? Seems like this isn\u2019t well thought out",
            "Mom will actually ***expect*** everyone to stay at the hotel at night, and not go anywhere a baby isn't supposed to be during the day.",
            "I probably would have skipped but I made the cake",
            ">Just be prepared to be expected to do some amount of childcare. Because, she will definitely expect everyone to assist. Which will require a level of sobriety and responsibility.\n\nThere\u2019s a perfect word for situations like this - it\u2019s called NO. \n\nMom can \u201cexpect\u201d everyone to help with her baby all she wants but that in no way obligates any of them to do so. If she gets upset at being told no, tough shit. You choose to bring your baby to a party, you take care of your own baby. You get to be sober and responsible. Why should anyone else have to unless they want to?",
            "I actually wholeheartedly agree with this because it happened to me. \nBachelorette party, one of our friends brings baby, and literally everything you said is true, the childcare help was sooo EXPECTED. \nBut my biggest pet peeve of it all was EVERY single time her baby made any noise she would get annoyed with us and say \u201comg stop ignoring [baby]!!!!! He\u2019s trying to talk to you guys!\u201d. (She thought this was ADORABLE to say)\n\nBut she interrupted *every single convo* we had for 3 days to say that. \nI remember being pretty drunk having one of those crying moments with a friend opening up, and in mid word this friend who brought their kid interrupted us to say we needed to stop ignoring her baby who was talking to us. \nHe was a BABY not even a year old. Like I promise you he had nothing to add to the convo \ud83d\ude02",
            "The mother probably shouldn't ask people who are doing shots to help with childcare.   I imagine that will be cancelled.  There won't be any barhopping because bars don't allow babies.  They would only be able to go to restaurants.",
            "But maybe they agreed that there are some activities planned where a baby would not interfere at all, whereas in the evenings the mother will stay in the hotel?\n\nOf course if OP has objections she should share them, but she is not the bride and it is not her place to tell people better not to attend.",
            "So piggy-backing on what you've just said, she could follow up with:\n\n\"Since you think I'm being too harsh, I'd like to hear your solution. What is this going to look like? What's the plan exactly? What's the new schedule? What's the new itinerary? And how will those differ from the previous schedule and the previous itinerary?\n\nI know I'm not the bride, but even as a guest, I'd like to know what I'm signing up for.\"",
            "Then she shouldn't go and ruin everyone else's time.\nI say that as a mom to 5 kids who had MAJOR anxiety when my kids were babies and never wanted to leave them ever. But I would've NEVER asked to bring my baby or kid to an adult event like this. It's fucking selfish!!!!",
            "Unfortunately, some men are good at hiding this trait till after you have a baby. Mine was, turns out he\u2019s 100% a narcissist",
            "Or if too far from home, baby's dad can stay in a hotel room (preferably far away from the group's rooms) with baby and mom, and mom can pop back and forth on her own time.",
            "Particularly in adults only situations! I just do not understand how they can think it is in any way okay.",
            "They downvoted you but you\u2019re right, if all this speculation about side chats is true it\u2019s pretty fucked up for them to act like OP is out of line for saying what they are all thinking.",
            "Those are awful",
            "I can\u2019t tell you how many onesies with a brown chicken and a brown cow I have given as a \u201cgarnish\u201d on a larger baby shower gift. It\u2019s my go-to.",
            "SAME! I can stay home with my own kids. Y\u2019all have fun though. \ud83d\ude02",
            "I'm not suggesting the mother of the child should leave the child alone in a hotel room? What? Why would you think that?\n\nI agree it'll be a downer to have a baby present *at all*, yes, I'm just saying if the new mom insists on showing up and the rest of the group wants to be weird about it, the only way to minimize the damage is for new mom + baby to have a separate accommodation so they can join when possible and leave when necessary",
            "I sure am! Our family welcomes most and we frequently \"adopt\" friends into the family. \n\nMy mom found out about 6 yrs ago that she has a half sister, her family basically rejected the half sister, blamed her for their father's cheating etc. With the exception of my mom. My dad's family has basically adopted her as a sister at this point.",
            "Like I said, depends on the group of people and what you are going to be doing. And of course you should ask beforehand and be fine with a no.",
            "EXACTLY! Forget all that!",
            "You better!!! Lol",
            "Seriously! My 8 month old is (between us) absolute shit at being a DD. To be fair I shouldn\u2019t be surprised, he\u2019s not very good at making simple beer runs either\u2026 as a mother I\u2019m obviously at the end of my wits.",
            "Also, will they have to watch all the stuff they bring to make sure the baby doesn\u2019t get into it or get hurt? Bringing a baby to an airbnb sucks because it\u2019s not going to be baby proofed like your house and you have to be on guard constantly. It\u2019s exhausting.",
            "This \nIs \nNot\nThe \nPoint",
            "I mean nothing you're saying is wrong or incorrect. But this mom is clearly entitled and irresponsible. It's easy to say you'll refuse to take care of someone else's kid, but most adults aren't heartless enough to actually stand by and knowingly allow an innocent kid be neglected. So if Mom winds up drinking too much or just decides to step away for a bit, other people would definitely step in to make sure the kid is ok and end up getting roped into childcare regardless. \n\nMy ex roommate had a little Yorkie. She went on a trip to Europe for a month and beforehand she didn't make firm plans about who was going to watch her dog. I asked her multiple times before the trip what her plan was and whether she wanted me to do it. She kept rejecting my offer and said one of her friends was going to come stay in her room and look after him. But after she left, days kept going by and I never saw this friend. Thank god I didn't make other plans and was around to make sure the dog never went without food, water, or bathroom breaks. Obviously I'm not a monster and am not going to let a dog suffer just because its owner was irresponsible. When she came back from the trip she admitted that she didn't stress over the dog care situation because she knew I loved dogs and would automatically take care of him if I saw he needed it. Some people are legit just like this, they have no problem taking advantage of those with a conscience.",
            "Yep. It's inevitable.",
            "And restaurants that allow infants. Because most high-end restaurants do not accommodate infants.",
            "This! I had a friend do this for my bachelorette. The baby came in to say hi in the morning but all activities involving alcohol mom came for as long as she was comfortable and then went home. Worked fine.",
            "It\u2019s early and I\u2019m still half-asleep. Why a brown chicken and a brown cow?",
            "Ohhh ok ok gotcha. I was like you can\u2019t just leave a baby lol there are no festivities for her or chances to pop out anywhere! \n\nGotcha. Good. \n\nIt\u2019s Reddit. It\u2019s not out of the realm for someone to think you can just pop out when you have a baby along lol",
            "Most 7mo babies aren't that mobile so chances are it isn't crawling yet. But still crazy.",
            "Lol fair enough, i definitely did not mean ditch the kid at the hotel to throw back tequila shots with the girls lmao\n\nReally i think her husband needs to step up and convince her to go without the baby though, sounds like separation anxiety she should be getting support for at home. This shouldn't be happening in the first place and the group should be pushing back on it for the new mom's sake too",
            "You\u2019re definitely weren\u2019t like \u201cOh just put a dish of water and throw some kibble on the floor, the baby will be good for a few hours no problem!\u201d Lol",

        "content": "Okay, so tonight myself F (28) and my husband M (28) (we have been married for 2 years and together for 6) were scheduled to have a friend of mine and her husband round for dinner. Our daughter 19 months had a temperature last night and seems to have a cold. She\u2019s very sniffly and has a temperature and when our daughter is unwell she wants to be held near constantly by myself and is very whingey and upsets easily (understandably so). With this is mind my husband suggested that we should cancel dinner tonight if she is still unwell by midday. I agreed, I think it is unwise to have people around if she isn\u2019t herself, as she needs our attention and it wouldn\u2019t be fair to potentially let our guests catch a cold/would be unfair to our daughter to not put her first and be available 100% to care for her. However, my husband then said, within seconds of suggesting we cancel the dinner.\n\n\u2018If we are postponing dinner, and obviously I\u2019m not pushing that. Fitstop has a trivia night on that I\u2019d like to go to instead\u2018\n\nMy logic is, if our daughter is unwell enough for us to cancel dinner with friends, and a handful as he knows, he shouldn\u2019t be making other plans to go out to trivia with his fitness group and leave me home alone with a sick child?\n\nHe should be staying home with us and helping out right?\n\nI said I would prefer if he stayed home and helped. He said he would come home early and help tidy the house clean and feed her and then go out for the evening, but I said that wasn\u2019t the point, it was more that I would prefer he be home and help out?\n\nHe hasn\u2019t been to one of his fitness groups socials since December last year due to his own work commitments, which I sympathise with. But he works out 2-4 nights a week and goes to a trading session most a unday mornings with them, which I understand isn\u2019t a social but he still gets to see them there.\n\nI\u2019m currently 6 weeks pregnant and going through significant fatigue, I\u2019m studying to be a nurse and the past 2 weeks I\u2019ve been on hospital placement shift working and I\u2019m really burnt out, I feel like if wasn\u2019t experiencing pregnancy fatigue, or had a really hard week I would maybe be okay with it, but my husband thinks I\u2019m being unreasonable by asking him to stay home and says I\u2019m delusional for thinking he isn\u2019t putting me first by going out instead of staying home.\n\nSo I\u2019m asking reddit to provide an opinion on this situation, am I being delusional by feeling that my husband should stay home?\n",

I couldn\u2019t make it as a woman, and if I were a woman, I don\u2019t think I would risk having kids for fear of being married to a man like your husband. \n\nThe only thing I can think of is that you should have clearly laid everything out for him since he seems so dense. \u201cI am pregnant, tired, overwhelmed with nursing school, work, caring for a sick, fussy child, did I mention tired (freaking exhausted) could you PLEASE stay home tonight to share the load. I understand you need your free time, which you get regularly, but I need help at this moment.\u201d\n\nI think men should have to work in a nursery/daycare center in their youth in order to get an idea of what it\u2019s like to raise children under five. \n\nBless you. If I lived near you, I would babysit.\n\nETA: Op, I\u2019ve been reading your comments, and it just keeps getting worse. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve read anything about your support system, but I sure hope you have one outside of your marriage. \n\nPlease suggest if one of those fitness classes can replaced with a weekly therapy session for him. It definitely sounds like he needs it. It scares me how often you use the word \u201clivid\u201d in your responses. His actions are why women build up resentment and leave. Of course,  it\u2019ll all be a complete surprise to him. \n\nI hope the little one gets to feeling better soon. Hugs.",

Not only could you be taking illness to others but you're pushing a lot on my plate.\" If he kept arguing with me I would stand my ground. Let's say kid goes to bed at 7pm...I'd say the only compromise I see that would not cause resentment is maybe if I get the same amount of time off either tonight or tomorrow...like ok you need to be home until 8pm and take care of the child by yourself.

You have a lot going on right now, so I\u2019d suggest letting him go to whatever the next fitness night is but having him stay home with you this time around.

            "i saw one of your replies about how you try to bring up balancing the childcare, but he says he works and uses that as an excuse. but taking care of the house IS work too. you are both working people, he may be bringing in money but you are maintaining the home he comes back to every night. plus, you\u2019re in nursing school, and growing another entire human being in your body. he is belittling you by calling you \u201cdelusional\u201d and devaluing all the effort you put into the life you two have together. trust me, you are an integral pillar that makes it possible for you two to have that life. it\u2019s intentional, he wants to make you feel too ashamed to ask again so he can continue to get away with it. he\u2019s trying to make you doubt your own reality and feelings of unfairness. and regardless of all of that, he is a parent. he has to show up and be a parent. \n\ni am so sorry you\u2019re in this situation. none of it is your fault. you can\u2019t change his behavior (and it you\u2019ve tried to talk it out, he refuses) but you can change the way you react to him. if he doesn\u2019t respect you, don\u2019t respect him. don\u2019t try to appease him or do him any favors. he will likely continue to try to make you feel crazy or insecure, but for you and your daughter and baby on the way, stand firm on your boundaries and what you need from him. it won\u2019t be easy, but it\u2019s what you deserve and you are not asking for too much. in fact, you\u2019re probably asking for too little, because you\u2019re already used to him giving you so little when it comes to this. try to remember that, the best you can.",

It's not your sole responsibility to take care of the kids, he should be doing the work too(and a bit extra in my opinion when you're currently pregnant).

            "Your daughter is a priority, and her wellbeing is the responsibility of both parents. IMHO, he didn\u2019t even have to put you in a position to ask him to stay with you and help take care of his child. He\u2019s so wrong for this one. You\u2019re definitely within your rights to ask him to skip the trivia night. Lastly, you\u2019re definitely not delusional. I hope he would be more supportive in the future. All the best in the future, especially as you\u2019re about to welcome a new baby and study. It could be overwhelming, however, with proper support system, you\u2019ll be just fine.",
            "It really seems like most of these replies are from people who have no idea what the situation is really like. Having a kid especially your first changes your world like you wouldn't understand unless you have one. My sons both only wanted mommy for stuff like this until they were close to 2. My wife breastfed them and was their life support so ofc they want her. The situation where your kid is latched to your spouse makes you feel somewhat pointless being there. That doesn't mean it is pointless but that is how it feels. \n\nI used to go to mtg tournaments and lgs events multiple times a week but once I had my first son I haven't got to go to one since it's the sacrifice of being a dad. Your husband is likely struggling with the lifestyle changes having a kid brings. Unfortunately you as the mom have it worse as atleast he can still occasionally find time for himself and you basically never do until your kids are older. \n\nThe other aspect of you being \"unemployed\" may look to him as not a difficult or exhausting task. I mean the baby takes what appears to be little work you feed it change it and let it do it's thing. How much mess can the house accumulate daily? This would be his perspective and it's likely he isn't a jerk but just misinformed. \n\nWhile people will say you gotta talk to him this is true however it will likely feel akin to a lecture and he will tune it out. I think you need to show him how hard what you actually do is and with that he hopefully comes around and gives you the support you need. \n\nP.S. the 2nd one is easier but he will likely be taking care of the first almost all the time when it pops out and for atleast 6 months.",

He works extremely hard and runs his own carpentry business. I help him by doing up invoices and quotes and book keeping. Since I started nursing school my daughter has started going to daycare as I have to attended campus 3x a week and the study load/assignments is full time. But I asked my husband before I started that would I be okay to do this over returning to work, he agreed to this. I\u2019m a beauty  therapist by trade and even if I worked full time I don\u2019t bring a lot of $$ in, even in managing roles I\u2019ve held. So by retraining to be a nurse I would have a better career with better pay helping out family finances in the future and it will look good on a mortgage application if I\u2019m in a respectable career.

            "No it\u2019s not, he never used to be this way. When we married he was truly my best friend and the love of my life, everyday together was an adventure. My pregnancy with my first was a stressful time, a business wouldn\u2019t pay us money they owed us and it nearly bankrupted us, we sacrificed all the money in our business and our personal savings to cover the wages of our employees to ride out the rough times, we got our payment in the end once solicitors were involved. This time period was very stressful for both of us and my husband had to work 7 days a week 12 hour days to keep us a float, I worked too in a home salon I had set up until a week before I gave birth. Once we had my daughter we had received the payment and we thought we were through the worst of it, then the same week our daughter was born his father called saying he felt unwell, within 8 weeks his father withered away and passed from stomach cancer. He was only 60 years old, it was very sudden and a very difficult time. My husband really changed after these experiences and he gradually became more distant and resentful towards me, I\u2019ve tried my best to be supportive, to talk to him to work through things to rekindle what we had, but he wants how he hates his life, he wants to \u2018live life\u2019 and he can\u2019t. He\u2019s working a lot to keep the business running and has debts like most. I think he never really grieved and it\u2019s all just coming out in an ugly way and I\u2019m the person he takes it out on?

I helped create them, I\u2019m going to help mold them. Seeing my girl go through a lot after birth (twice) impedes me from being a selfish person and doing things I usually do on my own without kids. I still work on my dreams and side hustles, but I always prioritize my kids first and I\u2019m also always encouraging my girl to try to take time off and do something on her own so she can be decompress , cause man, being a mother is tough since you have to breastfeed, the babies get attached to the mom more, dads at work while she\u2019s with the baby, and they\u2019re never ending work. So props to mama but she shouldn\u2019t allow her husband to just not help like that. He could have asked , which is what I would have done.

            "As a mom of 3 kids under 5, this can be a bigger issue than just trivia night. Planning things equally TOGETHER is crucial. You need to 100 percent be a team that always take both your schedules into consideration. That's just how it is with kids.\n\nWith kids, as with everything else, it's very easy to fall into patterns. If the pattern you have fallen into is that you've become the primary by default parent, then this needs to be addressed immediately.\n\nIt is an issue that might be hard for your partner to see and understand, if they're NOT the default parent, because this parent will feel like they're making sacrifices and caring for their kids - as they often do. But not in the same way. If you're the primary parent, you step away from the kids to do something else for a while when given permission or agreeing upon it. If you're the secondary parent, you step onto kid care duty when agreeing upon it and then off again. It makes a HUGE difference.\n\nBefore kids, all we had to do as partners was to let each other know our plans so that the other could plan accordingly, and occasionally plan some things together. But when our kids are born, by default someone always has to be with them. This means that the person who more often tended to do active stuff that required full focus and was non-negotiable to do with kids, that person has a more clear line to plan after. Maybe \"I do this every other day\" would turn to \"now that we have kids I do this once every other week\", and they see this as a compromise and sacrifice - which it is. But they don't see their partners sacrifice is the exact same and that they're also sacrificing their plans. It sounds simple and logical, but it is in fact easy to forget this in the moment.\n\nThey may also not see that their partner, who maybe doesn't have the habit of these super active out of the house hobbies may become the person who is always defaulted to compromise with their alone time. And that over time, maybe this child care you're giving is starting to be taken for granted by your partner, and that's when you will maybe start to feel like something is off - but can't put your finger on it because parents are \"by default supposed to care for their kids first and foremost\".\n\nYou have to plan everything with kids, basically. All plans have to be spoken out loud so that you both can plan, but it's easy for one of you to make more plans than the other, and both will feel like they're making the sacrifices to lessening the hobby time etc, but only one will feel like the default parent.\n\nThink about this dynamic that you have, because most of the frustration may come from this, and not from your partner going to a trivia thing or taking a cheeky opportunity to change plans.",

Don\u2019t bother taking them down and don\u2019t put away the laundry (or his laundry).  \n\nA lot of this depends on your tolerance for the mess that is then there, but it\u2019s freeing not having to do all it.

Like part of me wants to snowboard in the Andes while I'm alive and part of me just wants to snuggle with my kids while they're young, and no one is really behind the wheel to make that choice.  I know I can't have both.  I was going thru some big changes at work too, and that stressor is suffocating.  And my oldest was 4 when my dad died and my youngest was like 10 months, and the grief of them not really knowing him was fuckin massive.

        "content": "Hi! My son was born 3 weeks early and had to stay in the NICU for 1 month due to his breathing and lungs being underdeveloped. I was diagnosed with PPA and PPD and currently seeing a therapist. I have always had this agreement with my husband that we don\u2019t want anybody to kiss our baby anywhere on the face (meaning not on the cheeks, forehead, lips, anywhere). We do not kiss him either. I would love for my son to meet his great grandma but according to family, regardless if I ask her to not kiss the baby, my wishes will not be followed as this greatgma would never listen to anybody and will do whatever she wants. My husband\u2019s cousin said that a little kiss wouldn\u2019t hurt the baby, but this is the only thing I\u2019m requesting of them. Kissing is how you pass diseases to a baby with little to no immune system and even with immune system, you can pass hsv1 this way which is fatal to babies. I feel so so bad and feel guilty \u2014 I wanna give in and just let it happen but I know I\u2019ll regret it and have resentment towards people that\u2019s been making me feel like I\u2019m being irrational. What should I do? I\u2019m in a bind here. Am I wrong for my request???\n\nSorry if my grammar sucks. English is not my first language. ",

The baby couldn't fight off the virus and sustained brain damage and died.  If the family has already told you they wont respect your wishes, so no one can meet the baby until after they have had their vaccines and its safe. That's how it has to be.

            "TL;DR: you are not being out of line, if anyone feels they can\u2019t resist kissing the baby they need to abstain. And congratulations on your little one.\n\n\nNot sure how far out of the NICU your baby is, but my cousin had her kids on time, no health issues, and we weren\u2019t even allowed to see them until after three months. Considering your little one had health issues I think your request is more than fair. I love kissing babies, so if I were a family member so would probably just love from a distance to make sure I didn\u2019t mess up.\n\n\nAlso, take heart! Another friend of mine had twins in the NICU and they are now two do the strongest, healthiest, sassiest, sweetest little toddlers. And congrats! A baby is a blessing.\u00a0",
            "New mom here. I don't let anyone kiss my baby. I carry around a little bottle that I made of mild soap and water, and some paper towels. If anyone kisses her ANYWHERE, I immediately whip my DIY soap kit out and clean her right up. I don't kiss her on the face at all myself, only on her little body or the back of her head. You're right, germs are easily passed through the mouth, and something that won't harm a big kid or an adult could be very serious for a baby. This isn't forever, you aren't going to follow your baby around all his life demanding nobody kiss him. It's just for a few months.\n\nThat is YOUR baby, and if your baby gets sick, you're the one who will have to deal with that, not them. I have to remind people of this constantly. I just had a talk with a family member who wanted me to have my baby outside on the porch on a 100-degree day with an air quality warning, in a yard that was filled with mosquitoes. She kept saying \"babies need fresh air.\" Okay and when my baby gets a heat rash and is up crying all night, can I call you to come over?

Kissing was a huge *NO* for me, and I was very grateful my family followed my rules (partially due to the fact my sister is a NICU nurse herself, and was very blunt about the risks with them \ud83d\ude05). \n\n\nI don't think you're in the wrong at all, I think you're being very sensible. I would also suggest just avoiding people who are sick in general too, and get your household to stick with that as well. My daughter and son both caught covid at only three months old because a coworker of my husband's lied about being sick with covid (she told people it was just a \"cold\"), came into work anyway and spread the virus (we're in the UK where sick pay is a thing, it wasn't because she couldn't afford not to. She just didn't want to miss the company's table tennis tournament, and yes she did know it was covid. She later apologised to my husband after our son was hospitalised, because she'd had a positive test at home and come in anyway). My husband caught it, then despite my best efforts, so did our children. My son was absolutely floored by it. He was in A&E multiple times, and then eventually admitted to hospital. It's ruined his breathing for life, all because of one person. He now breathes with a permanent strider (think Darth Vader breathing sounds), and we've been told it's because he caught covid with already vulnerable lungs. When a baby needs breathing support, especially for something like RDS, they are much more vulnerable still later in life than your average newborn without lung issues. My son got lucky, he made a full recovery with only the permanent (thankfully benign) strider to show for it. But if my husband had just avoided this coworker, even with her saying it was \"just a cold\", maybe we'd be in a different situation.",

Let\u2019s set aside any psychological fears you may have. From a purely germ-centric standpoint, the reason this concerns me is because you may inadvertently deprive your son of opportunities to strengthen his immune system. It\u2019s important for him to get sick. It\u2019s what kids do, and at the time it\u2019ll suck for him and his parents, but that\u2019s the way it goes, and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been. For more serious illnesses, we have vaccines, so make sure you keep your son up to date on his shots. \n\nSo overall, yes, protect your son for these first few weeks while he\u2019s especially vulnerable as a premi, but ultimately, later on, he should be exposed to a reasonable amount of germs, and he will get sick, and it\u2019ll be stressful, but in the long run it\u2019ll be fine.\n\nNote to add the obvious: please don\u2019t take my word for anything, and consult your pediatrician",

            "That seems a little over anxious to me.\n\nIf you\u2019re not unwell, and have had your vaccinations, what\u2019s the issue?\n\nBabies and children need some normal exposure to bacteria and viruses in order to promote healthy immune systems. Keeping them in a germ free bubble harms them in the long run.",

            "Science doesn't change, but attitudes do.  And that is the part I was referring to.\n\nYou can take the hardline approach.  I have known MANY people who didn't want other people holding their baby.  People who sterilized surfaces cleaner than a hospital  I've known people who would get up an leave a party if people coughed near their baby.\n\nAnd all of those people have been first time parents.\n\nI understand your perspective- avoid germs to keep your baby healthy.  It's very good.\n\nBut I also am very familiar with the reality of having kids, and being with people who have kids.  You just can't worry about that stuff after a while.  If you did, you'd never get anything done.\n\nScience doesn't change, but attitudes do.  I was speaking of the parents attitude changing, and trying to say, \"don't worry about it, your kids will be okay.\"  My way of doing that was more of, \"Don't worry about this, later on you will find out that it's all going to be okay.  You're worried now because this is your first time doing this.\"\n\nObviously the poster is stressed out.  They mention depression.  I wanted to tell them that everything is going to be alright (it will).\n\nAnd you...you just want to tell them that this IS something they need to worry about, and science backs you up.  And YES, she should argue with her family about it.  Because that is what you think a new mom needs- a fight with family.\n\nBecause you don't understand her perspective of a new mom freaking out over a life that was just turned upside down, and she needs all the reassurance and family support she can possibly get.\n\nGood job making the new mom more upset.",

As many other responses beside mine have indicated, her concerns are well-founded. Sorry to hear you\u2019ve gotten less safety-minded over time.",
