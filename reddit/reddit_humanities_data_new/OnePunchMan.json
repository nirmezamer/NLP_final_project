            "**\"Void Confirms Parallel Worlds Branch Out with Infinite Possibilities\"**\n\nPower Scalers and Fanfic Makers:  Our time has come",
            "Careful, Flashy. Your tsundere is showing.\n\nEmpty Void is definitely seeming a lot cooler. He's a goofball at times, but I like that.\n\nAnd I'm liking this sassy Obi Wan energy from Blast!",
            "This was truly our Ninjutsu Kaisen\n\nI like this current version of Empty Void\u2019s design more than the one we saw in the flashback",
            "Man this version does such a better job of showing void off. We got a really interesting depiction of how the dimensional slash works and both flash and sonic get to have their respective moments in their defensive.",
            "Blast deadass said \ud83d\ude1b",
            "Blast panicking because he lost track of Flash is peak OPM lmao.",
            "I love how Blast was showing he wasn't just a 'badass' in this chapter, and is just a silly guy. It's so funny with his \ud83d\ude1b and his bulging eyes. He's really not beating the Joseph Joestar accusations \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
            "I like the duo and giving each something they are better at, Flashy with skills that are above and Sonic solid conviction to not be tempted. It's a nice touch for this pair of tsundere friends.\n\nBlast vs ninja dude is gonna be epic. Lots of dimension and what ever scifi stuff they will cook up.",
            "Empty Void feels way stronger and more threatening in these redraws. I also really like his monstrous appearance in this chapter. The bit of extra characterization with Flashy and emotional dependence is great too. Overall a definite improvement.",
            "Blast coming in like a professor proud of his 2 best students passing the final exam.",
            "Void\u2019s conversation with flash/sonic reminds of Sage Centipede\u2019s conversation with metal bat and garou LOL",
            "Flashy realizing his emotional dependency on Sonic gksjagjdkfks \ud83d\ude2d",
            "The OPM Multiverse has officially begun dudes.",
            "Redraws are over, we passed!",
            "mistranslation i think ? \"blast says i hid my upper body in another dimension\" instead of his as in sonic",
            "Dear Lord, Empty Void can travel to parralel timelines/universes it seems and choose the attack any. It does seem like the Dimension slash isn't an instantaneous attack since Flash was able to react to it (or he just predicted that it would come since he's seen it before).",
            "Glad that Sonic got to save Flash without making Empty Void seem weaker, in the original he managed to give Empty Void a big cut in his arm which was kinda weird",
            "This is much better. The time spent on these redraws are worth it if the quality improves this much.",
            "[The best part of this chapter](https://i.imgur.com/w9tm8H7.png)",
            "That \"you pass\" is very suspicious, maybe he is choosing a timeline where he fools them by disguising as Blast and succeeds",
            "The thought of Flash depending on Sonic LMAOO",
            "How chill blast is imo is so funny",
            "Refreshed at the right time",
            "Flash almost getting caught twice. Smh",
            "I wonder if Flash \"passing\" the test only because Sonic saved him is ever going to come up.\n\nMaybe Blast trusts him with knowledge he might not be ready for?",
            "Alternate realitities\u2026. I\u2019m adding Saitama fights himself to the bingo card",
            "Powerscalers edging to this fr",
            "Any sonic/flash ships out there??\n\nI still think boros ship is the best ship tho",
            "This chapter is fanservice to FlashyxSonic shippers and I am eating good",
            "Blast: :p",
            "Blast being a gag is one of the best things ever",
            "Empty Void looking like Kaiju No 8 for a second",
            "So Empty Void is stronger than Cosmic Garou it seems, he's shown feats that Cosmic Garou did not have, like the ability to grab the fabric of space with his bare hands, move at an impossibly fast speed that surprised Flashy Flash, and attack from other dimensions.",
            "Blast is cool",
            "I love Blast's dad energy",
            "we're gonna get dominator of the multiverse boros now trust",
            "Okay, that whole thing that \"That Man\" did of watching all the different possibilities by seeing all the parallel worlds before doing that Dimension Slash was really insane. I guess I should not be that surprised considering the crazy things Garou could also do.\n\nSo Blast has been following Sonic all this time. That fake-out he did was really insane. Well, I can't wait to see how him, Sonic, and Flashy Flash deal with Empty Void.",
            "Yes please we need more volunteers for redraw :)",
            "Outside of the causality of the universe?? Power scalers are gonna have a field day with this chapter \ud83d\ude02",
            "God I'm starting to love Blast because of these redraws \ud83d\ude2d so much personality",
            "Blast with that Big Dad Energy",
            "That blep from Blast, though.",
            "I guess Flashy will take the fact that he would give in to God to his grave. Or will he be humble enough?",
            "This is one of the best starts of a OPM chapter EVER! I can't stop laughing, it's even beautiful as a composition XD",
            "Blast: Both of you overcame the temptation of the cube huh?  \nFlash: Oh, ya, sure, ya, totally did, ya bro, totally.",
            "Thank you, truly grateful for the translation team \ud83d\ude4f",
            "Sonic/Flash\u2019s egos are so steel they dont even register the words attempting to divide em",
            "Blast vs Empty Void, next chapter is going to be amazing!",
            "Bro thought he was Sukuna \ud83d\udc80",
            "Flash definitely didnt get that nosebleed from sonics punch",
            "Flash, let me see you grit those teeth!",
            "I like that they made Blast a bit more human. It makes him more fun when he can be wrong and not always dead serious all the time.\u00a0",
            "Saitama is going to become multiversal! Take that power scalers!",
            "Is it just me or is Tats repeating the same pose from many chaps ago?",
            "Need blep Blast riding a blep pony.",
            "Flashy Flash went to the right place\n\nThe rogue ninjas and Void went to the right place. \n\nBlast went to the right place.\n\nLiterally nobody fell for the wording in the letter.l",
            "Void's powers seem impressive at first, but his beyond dimensional  perception was fooled by a simple gate by blast and his \"beyond causality\" Dimension Slash was easily sensed by Flashy Flash who is way below Evolved Garou let alone Cosmic Garou.\n\nStill not sure how he stacks up against Garou",
            "The theory of Blasts team containing a bunch of the alternate versions of villains that are heroes might be true since the multiverse is a thing.",
            "holy shit, this chapter was great",
            "Redraws were worth it.",
            "If I had a nickel for everytime one of my favorite characters got killed by a slash that cut the world, I\u2019d have nearly 2 nickels. It\u2019s not much but it\u2019s weird it almost happened twice",
            "Love it when there are gag moments, Void slightly annoyed with the mindset of the duo.\n\nAlso when Blast lost them due to fog \ud83d\ude04 Ninjas being talkative lol \n\nWholesome too that Flashy and Sonic cares about each other, despite being dere about it.\n\nWill we get to see Saitama in action against Void? The bickering, reactions would be so funny haha.",
            "Blast losing track of Flash and Void being silly are the best moments of the chapter, however the expansion of cosmology is very interesting, now I really want manga to meet webcomic universe",
            "What does empty void means when he says \" to think there was only one harvest\"",
            "[Blast slapping Flashy Flash and Sonic](https://i.imgur.com/5nDD8c1.png) on the back reminded me of that one Berserk panel where [Guts slaps Griffith on the back.](https://64.media.tumblr.com/4506fa60793b706b143d9024d3f2d634/tumblr_pg7pdlaKrC1vqf4c6_500.png)",
            "I guess we learn how his dimension slash works now\n\nAnd lol they made blast a bit more goofy, but that\u2019s better since this is a comedy manga + it gives him personality\n\nSo void says flash has more skill but Sonic has more heart (control over his emotions I guess)",
            "It\u2019s been so long I completely forgot this was coming out today. Nice to not check the raws beforehand",
            "Evil Saitama confirmed with this multiverse thing",
            "kinda glad sonics god offer was removed, ik opm is a comedy but i felt like it didnt match. Tatsumaki saw blast, Garou saw Bang, Flash saw Sonic, but Sonic saw a monster cell?",
            "I know there's no way this happens now, but I'm full of copium and hoping that Saitama off-screens Void like he did in the WC.",
            "Wait so this guy has access to the multiverse and he uses it to make really big slashes? This is the biggest abuse of power I have ever seen what is wrong with him????\n\nI\u2019m starting to understand why Saitama accused Geryuganshoop of using psychic powers to toss rocks at people. Some people have no idea how to use their abilities.",
            "Where do you scale him, Multiversal or high Universe\u00a0",
            "Lol now the multi solar fodder saitama gonna become Multiversal+\nAfter beating empty void\u00a0",
            "the link doesn't work 503 error",
            "Power scalers about to go crazy because of this chapter.",
            "So it would seem that Void has a potential way around the Zero Punch because he can move outside of causality but I don't think that Saitama would do that again anyways, he will probably find a way even more ridiculously insane to deal with Void. (Imagine a Serious Series: Serious Omni-Dimensional Punch or something that hits an infinite amount of times at the exact same time and maybe during their fight Saitama is gonna power up so much that while fighting they destroy entire parallel dimensions. Void is trying to evade Saitama by going to other dimensions but he's just going to punch his way into those dimensions. I'm already getting really hyped up imagining what their fight is going to be like)\n\nBut the implications with the Dimension Slash are insane as well going full Sukuna with that move here in Saitama Kaisen",
            "Great chapter.. but it's to short sensei... Toooooo short for to wait 3 weeks \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d.... I need more",
            "Flash saying 'thank gosh' instead of 'thank god' (because god is their enemy) made me chuckle.",
            "Blast is very likeable lol.\n\nIs he going to make a elite team of Heroes who passed through the test and are resistent to God? To be introduced to his Galactic team?\n\nSo far we have Tatsumaki, Flash and Sonic. Saitama and Garou might be included too.",
            "is the story ever going to continue?",
            "It\u2019s interesting to see how Flash was tempted by something other than power. It\u2019s also cool to see how void noticed Flash was still susceptible and tried to use the cube again. These redraws added a ton of depth to Flash. It\u2019s kinda sad though that Flash seems to really care about Sonic, but the feeling doesn\u2019t seem mutual. He\u2019s basically Sonic\u2019s Fubuki\n\nEdit: also anyone else notice the random leg behind sonic when he\u2019s cut in half?",
            "W chapter",
            "Since we have a multiverse Saitama will be just as strong in each universe just with a different gimmick. One punch, one kick, one headbutt, etc.",
            "Omg Blast is bringing 2 ninja twinks to space with him!",
            "I\u2019ll say it every chapter he shows up- I love seeing blast, he\u2019s so so cool. The wait and the anticipation was all worth it for me, this guy is just the best !!!",
            "Damn, that Dimension Slash gives me Mahapralaya vibes. Void just being Arjuna Alter here xD",
            "It was a long journey but the revisions are done for now.",

            "Guys can you tell me where empty void scale to",
            "Why is it Chapter 201 for the English translation of Chapter 199? I follow along on the official tonarinoyj.jp and was momentarily very confused at how the English got 2 chapters ahead.",
            "lol Blast being like >.>\n\nGot an Lol out of me",
            "Sooo when making an archive for the manga we now need all the original chapters before rewrites (the ones involving actual story change) to be placed in as alternate dimension history cannon chapters. Maybe in a separate folder labels alternate timeline as chapter xxxb\n\n\nAlso also does this mean the webtoon is an alternate reality timeline?",
            "I have a theory that God is causing the redraws. Fist it was Garou, Now void. God tried to avoid void getting one shott by Saitama by creating parallel worlds but Saitama is still going to one shott him in hyperspace and shit on god again.",
            "Flash in love with Sonic confirmed? Also what is the random leg in page 15 doing? And I'm pretty sure Blast was talking about how he hid *Sonic's* upper body with a gate, not his own. WRONG TRANSLATION",
            "The redraw arc has finally ended...for now",
            "Remember folks. Murata never kills the pretty ones. The second I saw it I knew it was a fake out.",
            "These redraws were definitely worth it.",
            "The fall off of this manga needs to be studied",
            "looney toons ahh chapter wtf",
            "Goofy aa Blast",
            "Blast is a gigachad. He is awfully casual dealing with someone who absorbed garou's cosmic power. Lol hope he let's loose in two weeks.",
            "Nah, Tatsu does not wear panties, there is just no way to explain this cover",
            "I don't know why I get my hopes up for more pages with each delay, that never happened... Also different question, OPM is the only manga I read, do other mangas also have such short chapters with less than 20 pages?",
            "I love funny Blast!",
            "with this everything we have thought about changes! the possibilities are now infinite! i never thought of the idea of parralel worlds, with that genos as mad cyborg might be very plausible as a theorie than it have ever being! also you could even explaing what the redrwas could mean with it (like if it was an actual part of the story to have the redrwas and not just the authors doing because they want it)",
            "Ah, so that's why Blast is never around. He's busy fighting horrors in other parallel dimensions.",
            "Cool to see Sonic get a big focus",
            "First we got the greatness that is time travel.\n\nNow we are going to get parallel universes?\n\nStop my beating heart, this is everything I love!\n\nI hope all the black cubes end up combining in a piece of armor, maybe a gauntlet, for god to wear for the final battle.\n\nDamn that would be insane.",
            "World cutting slash with extra steps huh",
            "When Empty Void phase out to release his Dimension Slash it gave me DMC 3 PTSD",
            "Cool",
            "Blast recognise Soniic\nGame recognise Game",
            "With the parallel universes being introduced,  it could open the possibility of someone from a parallel universe coming to the opm world.",
            "Awesome. Best redraw yet.",
            "Yo what's with the leg and the other body that got dismembered after Sonic got \"halved\"?",
            "He really thought he could use interdimensional powers without Blast noticing, huh?\n\nAlso that last page is major \"Xena can't fly!\" energy.",
            "amazing chapter. Thank you for your translation",
            "So, uh, Sonic is actually immune of genjutsu right?",
            "That bastard stole Captain Yami's Dimension Slash.",
            "Good chapter, loved Void's upgraded attacks.",
            "Finally like a chapter from this arc. Can\u2019t wait to see Saitama travel between dimensions or something to that nature",
            "Thank you.",
            "Dimension slash is a weaker version the almighty but explains the almighty so much better instead of attacks he can send yhwach warps every reality",
            "Im abit confused , when flash saw sonic got cut in half, it was illusion created by the cube right? (Sry , my English isnt good, so i struggle to understand what happen)",
            "Will Blast finish void or will Saitama last minute kill void by snatchjng him while trying to escape to another dimension?",
            "I hope we can get fanart of Blast standing cupping a grumpy Sonic under one arm and a grumpy Flash under the other, like they're angry cats",
            "This is so cool,  parallel universes with infinite possibilities!???? In that case , maybe in one universe ONE is a better artist than Murata!!!\nBTW love this retcon chapter. it actually shows way more information about Void's power.",
            "NO WAIT WHAT???? Finally. Bro. This is what i was waiting for. All those infuriating revisions, but it was all worth it in the END LETS GO!!!!",
            "Outside causality of the universe so it's just like Saitama's zero punch",
            "so as of now we\u2019re officially \u201ccaught up\u201d to where we were before the redraws started right? so from here forward it should be all strictly \u201cnew\u201d stuff",

To see the bond between frash, sonic, and even blast further cemented is beautiful to watch! Looking forward to seeing how void gets finished off, as I'm sure it'll be an incredible spectacle!! But if not and if he somehow gets redemption arc'd then I'm not complaining because he has funny banter with the others! Great action focused chapter!",

It is confirmed that he is able to view infinite number of possibilities where can alter them physically, a more overpowered yhwach - that means that the pre-retconned chapter is canon and the events did exist however he was able to exit the universe and look for another event in a different universe, which has happened in this chapter. Multiversal opm is fucking real! Lets fucking go!",
            "Ok damn, we just got parallel worlds confirmed. Can't wait to see Void despair seeing his ass getting kicked in every timeline by Saitama/Blast. Also, Blast just got way more character in one chapter than the other 200 chapters. He's way more goofy than I imagined lol.",

To the point where ki users fighting are like toddlers punching each other.. while also throwing 100-megaton thermonuclear bombs at each other.\n\nNow, if DBZ wasn't confusing enough.. Super had just straight-up thrown power scaling out the window almost completely in some cases. Like, you had Goku in Super Saiyan God form in the beginning of DBS nearly \"destroying the universe\" while clashing with Beerus.. yet far later on we have Goku fighting Moro in Ultra Instinct (_far_ more powerful of a form) only causing massive shock waves across Earth. Same with every other form like Super Saiyan Blue, stronger than SSG, not causing havoc across the universe every time a fight happens.\n\nEvery time I point this out some DragonBall-head goes _\"wELL DuH!1! THey'rE uSinG ki ConTrOL iDiOt!\"_\n\nYeah.. never recall \"ki control\" ever being mentioned in Super other than when Whis was teaching them to hide their aura from opponents. Also, laughable if anyone tries to argue that a madman like Broly even has a grasp of controlling his destructive ki output...\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBuuut if anyone wants a general idea from what I know, going by feats in the DBS manga..\n\nGoku and Vegeta, in their Super Saiyan Blue forms, wield at least enough physical striking power to destroy planets, and possess the raw ki energy to annihilate galaxies (Kamehameha, Galick Gun, etc.). Their Ultra Instinct and Ultra Ego forms in the latest DBS arc increase their power dramatically, probably around a magnitude above.\n\nBasically, powerful enough that if Empty Void went to their world and challenged them.. he'd likely get beaten to a pulp. Though, I imagine the two Saiyans aren't immune to the _Dimension Slash_.. which could very well mess them up **real** badly.\n\nI imagine me saying that is gonna make a lot of people mad, but recall how even Roshi accidentally trapped Vegeta in a bottle with a rather simple hax-like technique (Evil Containment Wave). _Bro got caught like a wild Pok\u00e9mon._\n\nI imagine only the Angels would have a way to deal with such a hax move.",

I'm not sure yet if I should go on another 1 year break from the manga and come back and read it after a year and see where things are at. I don't neccessarily want to invest my time in a manga that constantly changes things in the story and goes on breaks every now and then.

            "I'm not OP but *Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint* is absolutely amazing if you're willing to give Manhwas a try. It looks like one of those stereotypical power fantasy stories, but instead of being that and cringey it ends up building a really interesting universe with a good set of characters. It uses a lot of real historic figures, religion, culture and so on as well so you get some awesome foreshadowing and the author gives you the ability to really think on the plot as it moves.\n\n*Spy x Family* is great comedy manga that also has slice of seriousness. It's univers is heavily based around the World War and Cold War eras.   \n\n*We Shall Now Begin Ethics* is a banger, although quite short and unbelievably slow updates. It's about an Ethics/Philosophy teacher where each chapter or arc is centred around one of his students, where he either directly or indirectly helps them get through some of the rough points of their lives. It's a very real manga in the sense that he's not a saviour but it shows how one person can make a difference in someone elses life, coupled with other nice take aways. \n\n*Dorohedoro* Post-apocalyptic world split mainly into two categories; Sorcerer's World is a gothic-ish upper class area/world, then there's The Hole, a lawless trashy place where all the magic waste from the Sorcere's World is dumped. The art style kind of a Japanese-fied Fallout (The Hole) meets gothic mages (Sorcerer's World) with a thin layer of steam punk painted over all of it. Highly recommend in general but even more so if you're into these settings.\n\n*Golden Kamuy* Is insanely good, although I primarily watch the anime but I cant' see how the manga could possibly be worse. It's depicted around the ~1910s, post the Japan-Russia war. It's hard to describe the atmosphere but it has a suprising amount of comedy for being so serious. But it is very well placed comedy and the story is amazing. Read the [synopsis](https://anilist.co/manga/86559/Golden-Kamuy/) and if it sound remotely interesting go read it right now (or watch it if you prefer that, there's 4 seasons released with the final 5th confirmed to be in the works)",

            "He lost to Topless Dragoness(TD), his archenemy, because the Topless Style(TS) counters TankTop Magic(TTM), then, when she burned the tanktop and destroyed his main source of energy apart from the TankTopThong, TTM couldn't even match the CSRC and was severely weakened.\nTD also fought using underhanded tactics, especially the taking a tanktop store hostage and then destroying it.",

            "Hot Take powerscaling should include both higher end feats and lower end feats because for example some people scale Aizen to 4D or some shit but the fact that he was impressed by a mountain level attack while fighting Ichigo is a clear contradiction\n\nInb4 galaxy level mountain \ud83d\udc80",

            "Unironically though empty void having an outerversal ability and missing with his most powerful attack is so embarrassing",

            "From my point of view, that's not really what happened. Void deliberately missed Flash to create an illusion where Sonic would be cut in 2 to better corrupt him with the cube.\n\nedit: I reread the chapter and it's actually Blast who makes it look like Sonic is cut in half. But that doesn't change my basic reasoning. He hit Flash but didn't want to kill him. He just wanted to corrupt him using the cube.",
            "They really do though, I've seen someone legitimately scale Namek Saga Frieza to universal because \"He is called the Emperor of the Universe\" \n\nI've seen solar system level Godzilla because in one of the movies Space Godzilla is THEORISED to be made from an exploding star \n\nI've seen Planetary King Piccolo because he threatened to destroy the world",

            "Actually depends on how it was dodged because reacting to and consciously avoiding a light speed beam would require you to move faster or as fast as it, so yk",
            "For me, powerscaling is meant to be a simple \"this character is stronger than this character because x\" but when powerscaling gets to \"this character disintegrated a rock, therefore they are universal because that is a near impossible feat of physics\" then they lose me. Also, why do people cherry-pick statements? For example, the Author of DB said that ONLY Zeno can destroy a universe and yet people say that Goku can",
            "Did you forget what series this is?\n\nI know it's not the same character, but still.",
            "Dude, have you ever received a punch to the face? That shit hurts, you can't blame him",

            "It never depends on it, I doubt that any fictional laser actually travels as fast as light",
            "Powerscaling is supposed to use feats, statements and logical deduction to find the MOST CONSISTENT power level of a character.\n\nSo it can't be as simple as you're saying else lot's of inconsistencies arise.\n\nBut at the same time some powerscalers also make it too complex or deep which ALSO leads to inconsistencies.\n\nSo in the end, for some characters, it comes down your ability to convince someone rather than an objective power level that should be obvious to everyone.\n\nI also don't buy the universal Goku stuff btw.",
            "It does depend on it, it\u2019s fiction so a laser can travel at whatever speed is stated, though lasers literally move at light speed regardless (kinda). Just because you doubt it doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t happen",
            "I just don't like when power scaling clashes with authors intent I guess, for example, I doubt Showa Godzilla is 4D because another Kaiju has \"4D beams\" or whatever that whole thing was, or King Piccolo being planetary because of a statement saying \"at his full power he could DESTROY THE WORLD\"\n\nTo me, most powerscaling seems to be people taking statements at face value and going with that, it's never \"this character survived a nuke, therefore they can survive a nuke\" it's \"this character survived a nuke that also destroyed a rock, destroying matter is physically impossible, therefore this nuke was universal and the character has universal durability\", shit like that is why people make fun of powerscalers so much",
            "I mean most of the time lasers don't have stated speed and trying to apply light = laser = light speed logic to universes where gods, wizards and all crazy stuff exist is never smart lol",
            ">To me, most powerscaling seems to be people taking statements at face value and going with that, it's never \"this character survived a nuke, therefore they can survive a nuke\" it's \"this character survived a nuke that also destroyed a rock, destroying matter is physically impossible, therefore this nuke was universal and the character has universal durability\", shit like that us why people make fun of\n\nAnyone who makes such an argument would be called retarded by most powerscalers so I don't know where you got this idea from.\n\nAuthors have to powerscale in order to maintain consistency in their stories. They might not go as deep as fans may go but they have to nonetheless. \n\nAnd the point of powerscaling is to find the MOST CONSISTENT power level for character closest to what the author likely intended.\n\nBut a lot of times the author doesn't fully understand the implications of what they are writing and it ends up leading to the exaggerated powerscaling you seem to be talking about.",
            "True to an extent, but by that logic we shouldn\u2019t apply any real world logic to fiction, which obviously causes problems as most of the time there isn\u2019t entire in-universe rules stated, so we have to go off of what we know is true unless it\u2019s stated otherwise"
